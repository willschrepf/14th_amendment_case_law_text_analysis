Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Boudin, Lipez, and Howard,\n\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert J. Rosati with whom ERISA Law Group was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Laurie F. Rubin with whom Prince, Lobel, Glovsky & Tye LLP was\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 7, 2011\n\f             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.     Deborah Maher, a registered\n\nnurse, began work at Massachusetts General Hospital (\"MGH\"), in\n\nAugust 2001.      Maher stopped working in November 2001 and, in\n\nFebruary 2002, began receiving disability benefits through MGH's\n\nlong-term disability plan due to chronic abdominal pain and related\n\nsymptoms.1    Her physicians--although never \"entirely clear\" on the\n\ncause--attributed her symptoms to chronic pancreatitis, chronic\n\npain syndrome or fibromyalgia.     Over time, joint pain added to her\n\nwoes, and Maher received \"impressive amounts of narcotics\" to\n\nmanage her pain, which caused some negative side effects.\n\n             In February 2007, Liberty Life Assurance Company of\n\nBoston (\"Liberty\"), the plan's claims processor, terminated Maher's\n\nbenefits.      After a June 2007 letter misquoted plan language,\n\nLiberty concluded in a corrected September 2007 letter that Maher\n\nwas no longer \"totally disabled,\" defined in Section 2.10 of the\n\n\"The Massachusetts General Hospital Long Term Disability Plan\" (the\n\n\"primary plan document\") as\n\n             such complete incapacity, resulting from a\n             medically determinable physical or mental\n             impairment, as prevents the Participant from\n             performing   any  and   every   duty  of   any\n             occupation or employment, for which he is\n             reasonably qualified by education, training or\n             experience.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      We refer to the MGH Long-Term Disability Plan, technically\nthe defendant in this case, as the \"MGH Plan.\" We refer to the\nplan documents and terms as \"the plan.\"\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            This   determination    was   based   in    part    on    medical\n\nassessments    more   fully   described   below   but    also    on    covert\n\nsurveillance video showing Maher driving, walking, jogging, bending\n\nover, flying a kite, and lifting her three-year-old child.                The\n\nmost comprehensive assessment was by Dr. Robert Millstein, a\n\nmedical consultant at Liberty, who based his judgment on review of\n\nMaher's medical file.    He confirmed diagnoses by Maher's personal\n\nphysicians of her fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis but\n\ndetermined that none prevented Maher from working.\n\n            Maher pursued administrative appeals with Liberty and\n\nultimately with Partners HealthCare System, Inc. (\"Partners\"), the\n\nplan's administrator.     She submitted supporting materials, most\n\nnotably March 2007 statements from her personal physician, Dr.\n\nElizabeth     Cuevas,     and      Dr.    Wolfram       Goessling,        her\n\ngastroenterologist. Dr. Cuevas represented that Maher, despite her\n\npain medications, \"remains in significant disability, both from her\n\nchronic pain and from the side effects the pain medication cause,\n\nsuch as somnolence.      She is unable to reliably perform duties\n\nbecause her pain can become so severe so quickly.\"                    And Dr.\n\nGoessling stated that \"I do not see any way that my patient would\n\nbe able to sit or stand for prolonged period[s] of time let alone\n\ndo physically or intellectually demanding work.\"\n\n            During the ensuing appeals, new doctors independently\n\nreviewed Maher's files.         Dr. Herbert Malinoff, conducting the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\findependent assessment on Maher's appeal within Liberty, consulted\n\nwith Dr. Cuevas and Dr. Goessling, but ultimately found Maher's\n\nsymptoms \"far out of proportion to any abnormality identified\n\nphysically\";    Dr.   Dean   Hashimoto,    conducting     the    independent\n\nassessment on Maher's final appeal to Partners, agreed disability\n\nhad not been established.       Broadly speaking, both, along with Dr.\n\nMillstein, believed that the physical data did not explain the\n\ndegree of pain or other symptoms claimed by Maher and found she had\n\nprovided insufficient other evidence of completely debilitating\n\npain.\n\n            Partners formally denied Maher's last appeal in January\n\n2008.    Maher sought review of her benefits termination in federal\n\ncourt under section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(a)(1)(B) (2006).                The district\n\ncourt,   reviewing    the    plan   administrator's     decision    under   a\n\ndeferential \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard, entered summary\n\njudgment for the MGH Plan and upheld the termination of benefits.\n\nMaher v. Mass. Gen. Hosp. Long Term Disability Plan, No. 08-10460\n\n(D. Mass. Fed. 23, 2010) (unpublished order).               Maher has now\n\nappealed, challenging both the standard applied by the district\n\ncourt and the substantive decision.\n\n            The standard of review presents an issue of law which we\n\nreview de novo, Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability Plan, 70\n\nF.3d 173, 178 (1st Cir. 1995).        The denial of benefits is itself\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsubject to de novo review (albeit ordinarily on the administrative\n\nrecord)   \"unless     the   benefit     plan    gives   the   administrator    or\n\nfiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for\n\nbenefits or to construe the terms of the plan,\" Firestone Tire &\n\nRubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989), in which event the\n\ncourt applies a deferential \"arbitrary and capricious\" or \"abuse of\n\ndiscretion\" standard, Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 592\n\nF.3d 215, 224 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n           Here,      section    6.1    of     the    primary   plan     document\n\nunequivocally reserves to \"the Hospital\" authority \"to determine\n\neligibility for benefits, construe the terms and conditions of the\n\nPlan, and resolve disputes as to the interpretation of the Plan\n\ndocuments\";     and   it    explicitly        precludes    review    unless   the\n\nHospital's action was \"arbitrary and capricious or without rational\n\nbasis.\"   The \"Hospital\" is defined only as \"The General Hospital\n\nCorporation\"     (\"GHC\"),       which    is    a     Massachusetts     charitable\n\norganization whose sole member is MGH, whose sole member, in turn,\n\nis Partners.2\n\n           Maher's argument in favor of de novo review is that the\n\nfinal decision in this case was made by Partners; no proper\n\ndelegation of authority to determine benefits was ever made to\n\n\n     2\n      \"Member,\" in this context, is more or less the same as\ncontrolling party. See 18A Am. Jur. 2d: Corporations ยง 633 (2011)\n(\"[M]embers, while not usually denominated 'stockholders,' have an\ninterest in the corporate property similar to that of stockholders\nin ordinary corporations.\").\n\n                                        -5-\n\fPartners; and therefore Partners' decision to deny benefits is not\n\nprotected by section 6.1's deferential standard of review.                  It is\n\nclear enough that, absent a proper delegation, the MGH Plan could\n\nnot rely on section 6.1's standard to defend a denial by an\n\nindependent entity.         See Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 37-38\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              As it happens, GHC, MGH and Partners are in practice far\n\nfrom independent. Partners is a framework entity embracing MGH and\n\nBrigham--two     of   the    major   teaching     hospitals     in    Boston--and\n\nincludes   smaller    nonprofit      hospitals     as   well;   the    boards   of\n\ndirectors overlap; and Partners appears to operate in part as a\n\ncoordinating body that performs various functions for the member\n\nhospitals including, at least so far as the MGH Plan is concerned,\n\nadministrator of the plan in question on behalf of \"the Hospital.\"\n\nWe say \"appears\" because the MGH Plan has chosen to defend the case\n\nas one of conventional delegation.\n\n              This choice of litigation strategy lends a certain air of\n\nunreality to the situation.          The affiliation may explain why some\n\naspects of the alleged delegation are not as clearly formalized as\n\none   might     expect.       In   the    end,   viewed   as    a    conventional\n\ndelegation--the MGH Plan has not relied on affiliation or provided\n\ndetailed information about it--the treatment of Partners as a\n\nproper inheritor of \"the Hospital's\" discretionary authority is\n\njustified, but perhaps only by a modest margin.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          The    double    issue      is     whether     the   plan     \"expressly\n\nprovide[s] for procedures\" for GHC to designate Partners as a\n\nfiduciary with discretionary authority to administer the plan, 29\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1105(c)(1); Terry, 145 F.3d at 36, and, if so, whether\n\nthis had occurred.    The courts have not been overly demanding in\n\nthe search for express \"procedures.\" Wallace v. Johnson & Johnson,\n\n585 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2009).                 The district court relied on\n\nsection 6.3 of the primary plan document, which provides:\n\n          The Hospital may employ agents, including but\n          not    limited  to,   a    Claims   Processor,\n          accountants, attorneys or actuaries to perform\n          such services and duties in connection with\n          the administration of the Plan as it may\n          direct. . . . The Hospital shall be fully\n          protected in acting upon the advice of any\n          such agent, in whole or in part, and shall not\n          be liable for any act or omission of any such\n          agent, the Hospital's only duty being to use\n          reasonable care in the selection of any such\n          agent.\n\n          Maher argues that the focus of this language is primarily\n\non   ancillary   duties    to   aid        GHC    in   carrying   out    its     own\n\nresponsibilities.         Nothing     expressly        identifies       decisional\n\nauthority to determine benefits as a power that can be delegated.\n\nIf a separate identification were required, that might be the end\n\nof any delegation claim, but under the case law it is enough that\n\nthe language can be taken to include that delegation.                          E.g.,\n\nPettaway v. Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc., 644 F.3d 427, 434-35\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            Section 6.3 can be read quite broadly:                         the list of\n\nagents    GHC    may   employ      is    non-exhaustive,         nothing    limits    the\n\nservices and duties GHC may direct its agents to perform, and the\n\nattempt    to     relieve    GHC    of     liability       is    consistent    with    an\n\nallocation of responsibilities from one fiduciary to another.                         See\n\n29 C.F.R. ยง 2509.75-8, FR-14.                  Lawyers are commonly charged with\n\nfiduciary       duties,   and   ERISA      may       in   some   circumstances       treat\n\naccountants and actuaries as fiduciaries as well, despite merely\n\nproviding \"advice.\"          See 29 C.F.R. ยง 2509.75-5, D-1.\n\n            Here,      any    uncertainty            is   resolved   by    looking     to\n\nassociated documents including the trust agreement and the summary\n\nplan description, 29 U.S.C. ยง 1024(b)(4), which we are entitled to\n\nconsult.        Pettaway,     644       F.3d    at    433-34.      The    summary    plan\n\ndescription       clearly    states       that       \"Partners    acts    as   the   Plan\n\nAdministrator\" of MGH's long-term disability plan and \"has the\n\ndiscretion      to   determine      all    matters        relating   to    eligibility,\n\ncoverage and benefits under each Plan provided.\"3                    And, the plan's\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Maher argues that this document, titled \"Partners HealthCare\nSystem, Inc.: Health and Welfare Plan Document,\" is not a Summary\nPlan Description for MGH's long-term disability plan because the\ndocument lacks certain information and identifies the plan as an\ninsurance plan when it is in fact funded as a trust. But an MGH\nPlan affidavit confirms that the document is the Summary Plan\nDescription, and the document itself describes Partners' role in\nthe administration of several benefits plans--MGH's plan among\nthem--and says that it, together with certain other materials,\n\"constitute[s] the summary plan description for each Plan.\"\n\n                                           -8-\n\ftrust agreement contemplates certain actions being undertaken by\n\nGHC \"or its delegate.\"\n\n              Thus the plan instruments not only make clear that the\n\nplan authorized delegation of fiduciary responsibility to Partners,\n\nbut   also     that     such   delegation     actually       occurred.      Compare\n\nRodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 584\n\n(1st Cir. 1993)(documents taken together failed to delegate).\n\nGiven that delegation, the denial will be upheld only \"if it is\n\nreasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\"                 Gannon v. Metro.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 360 F.3d 211, 213 (1st Cir. 2004).                    Maher has the\n\nburden of proving her disability. Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins.\n\nCo., 404 F.3d 510, 518-19 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 937\n\n(2005).\n\n              Turning then to the denial of benefits, it is common\n\nground that Maher suffers from significant medical afflictions and\n\nuses narcotics to combat pain.              The question is whether Maher's\n\nchronic      pain     and/or   narcotics     use    render     her   incapable   of\n\nperforming     the     sedentary   nursing    jobs    suggested      by   Liberty's\n\nconsultant in a \"transferrable skills analysis\" conducted during\n\nthe   review    of     Maher's   benefits;    the    jobs     included    full-time\n\nsedentary work as a telephonic triage nurse, nurse case manager, or\n\nutilization review nurse.\n\n              On Maher's side we have diagnoses of medical ailments\n\nunchallenged by Partners and explicit statements, already quoted,\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fby   her     own   doctors    who    treated      her--one     of    whom    assessed\n\n\"significant disability\" and the other of whom said that she could\n\nnot do      \"physically or intellectually demanding work.\"                  These are,\n\nof course, fairly summary assessments; but the last, if fully\n\ncredited and not contradicted by other evidence, might appear to\n\nrule out even the less physically demanding nurse-related positions\n\nsuggested.\n\n              Yet these assessments of disability also depended on\n\nMaher's self-reporting as to the effects of medication and, more\n\nimportantly,       the    severity   of    her    symptoms.         Maher    has    been\n\nplagued--among       other    things--by         pain,   nausea,     vomiting,       and\n\ndiarrhea.      She has seen a host of doctors, attended pain clinics,\n\nbeen       recurrently    hospitalized,      treated      with      high    doses     of\n\nnarcotics,         and       undergone           pancreatic         and       biliary\n\nsphincterotomies--surgical            procedures         designed      to        relieve\n\npancreatitis.4       So obviously she has serious symptoms;                   but the\n\nquestion remains whether they are disabling, and this brings us to\n\nthe heart of the problem.\n\n              In   some    situations,      the    degree     of    pain    or     other\n\ndysfunction corresponds with what doctors knowing of the malady\n\nwould expect or at least deem within range.                 Dr. Millstein clearly\n\n\n       4\n      Arguably Maher would not suffer such travails merely to\nstrengthen the credibility of a disability claim or be able to fool\nso many doctors over so many years if there were little or no\nserious pain. See Carradine v. Barnhart, 360 F.3d 751, 755 (7th\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                          -10-\n\fthought that this was not true here--detecting some signs of\n\nexaggeration    and    doctor     shopping--and    he    concluded   that   any\n\nnegative impact of the narcotics would be alleviated by adaptation\n\nto the dosages.    He also relied on both the surveillance video and\n\na number of other separate pieces of evidence to which one might\n\nattach more or less weight:\n\n                      -a\n                     September 2006 statement by Dr.\n          Cuevas,   Maher's  primary   care   physician,\n          stating that she had not placed restriction on\n          Maher for abdominal pain and was not aware of\n          restrictions from other doctors;\n\n                 -a November 2006 record from Dr.\n          Anthony Reginato, a rheumatologist, indicating\n          that Maher denied chills, vomiting, and\n          abdominal pain, but also complained of having\n          such pain over the previous 10 days; and\n\n                 -documentation that Maher had not seen\n          Dr. Wolfram Goessling, her gastroenterologist,\n          during 2006.\n\n          Dr.     Malinoff,      who   conducted   the    first   independent\n\nassessment, found Maher's symptoms \"far out of proportion to any\n\nabnormality identified physically,\" and again relied on Liberty's\n\nvideo surveillance.         Dr. Malinoff also consulted with Dr. Cuevas\n\nand Dr. Goessling.         Dr. Malinoff highlighted Dr. Cuevas' agreement\n\nthat \"there is no identifiable medical/internal medicine issue\n\nwhich would prevent this woman from carrying out sedentary or light\n\nlabor on a full time basis,\" and emphasized his disagreement with\n\nDr. Goessling's focus on Maher's self-reported symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          Dr.   Hashimoto,        conducting     the     last   independent\n\nassessment, discredited Maher's pain based on her failure to submit\n\nsupporting evidence of disability from her treatment in pain\n\nclinics; emphasized Dr. Cuevas' statement to Dr. Malinoff about\n\nMaher's physicians' inability to pinpoint an anatomic cause of her\n\nsymptoms; discredited Dr. Goessling's opinion due to his failure to\n\ntreat Maher in 2006; and relied on the video surveillance of Maher.\n\nHe also said that there was little evidence of either evaluation or\n\ntreatment of her claims of impairment based on narcotics use.\n\n          This is a fairly impressive set of objections but there\n\nare two aspects that concern us and, taken together, warrant remand\n\nfor further consideration.5       The first, and most important, rests\n\non the fact that at every stage of Maher's administrative appeal,\n\nLiberty   and   Partners'        reviewing     doctors    emphasized    the\n\ninconsistency   between    her    self-reported    limitations    and   the\n\nsurveillance video.       It is not apparent to us that any such\n\ninconsistency exists.\n\n          Maher reported that her activity varied based on the\n\nextent of her pain, nausea, and opportunity to pre-medicate for\n\nactivities, but that she generally spent most of her days in bed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      See Buffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co., 426 F.3d 20, 31-32 (1st\nCir. 2005); Majeski v. Met. Life Ins. Co., 590 F.3d 478, 484 (7th\nCir. 2009); Leger v. Tribune Co. Long Term Disability Benefit Plan,\n557 F.3d 823, 835 (7th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fIn over 90 hours of surveillance, the most damning evidence the MGH\n\nPlan can identify is 15 minutes during which Maher carried a bucket\n\nor flower pot and 30 minutes during which Maher played with her\n\nthree-year-old son in the park.         On 10 of the 19 days on which\n\nsurveillance video is available, Maher engaged in no activity.             On\n\nother days, Maher was shown sitting or standing outside her house\n\nwith her husband for about 20 minutes.\n\n          Thus most of the surveillance, far from contradicting\n\nMaher's disability, seems to confirm her lifestyle as generally\n\nhousebound with occasional, limited activity.               For the brief\n\nperiods of slightly more vigorous activity, Maher may have pre-\n\nmedicated or may have simply been having a \"good day\"--either of\n\nwhich would be consistent with her reported limitations.                   Of\n\ncourse, she    may   have   been   housebound   by    choice--that    is   the\n\ncritical question.     But this is far from a situation in which a\n\nvideo conclusively disproves the disability claim.6\n\n          This court earlier upheld a termination of benefits where\n\nclaimant's    credibility    was   called   into     question   by   sporadic\n\nsurveillance capturing limited activity.           Cusson v. Liberty Life\n\n\n     6\n      E.g., Oldrich v. Director, Office of Workers Comp. Programs,\n141 F.3d 1178 (9th Cir. 1998) (unpublished table op.)(claimant\nalleged disability due to shoulder injury but was seen chopping\ntrees and participating in competitive swim meet); see also Tsoulas\nv. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 454 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2006)\n(claimant reported complete inability to walk or stand without cane\nor wheelchair and never left house more than once per week, but\nsurveillance video showed claimant walking without cane, going the\nmall, and running other errands).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fAssurance Co., 592 F.3d 215, 228-30 (1st Cir. 2010).           But there the\n\nvideos showed activities that specifically contradicted claims made\n\nby the claimant as to how she spent her time and what actions she\n\ncould tolerate.     Id. at 225.   We cautioned in that case that weight\n\ngiven to surveillance in these sorts of cases depends both on the\n\namount and nature of the activity observed.          Id.\n\n              Apart from the video, the main objective fact relied on\n\nby Partners was Maher's failure to provide supporting evidence of\n\ndisability from her pain clinics. But Maher explained her attempts\n\nto   obtain    documentation   from    those   clinics   and   offered   both\n\nreleases to allow the MGH Plan to access the information and to\n\nsubmit to examination by a doctor of the MGH Plan's choosing.              It\n\nalso appears that two of the three pain clinics were MGH-affiliated\n\nso the information ought to have been accessible.\n\n              In the end, the MGH Plan was entitled to be skeptical:\n\nthe claimant has a stake in the outcome; and the treating doctors\n\ndo not purport to explain the degree of pain claimed.               But the\n\nvideo evidence and failure to produce pain clinic information seem\n\noverstated.     We cannot say with assurance that the MGH Plan denied\n\nMaher benefits to which she was entitled, but even according\n\ndeference we are also not confident that its analysis has fully\n\njustified its decision.\n\n              The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\nmatter remanded to the district court so it may allow Partners to\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fconduct such further review and provide such further explanation\n\nand information as it sees fit, providing Maher a fair opportunity\n\nto respond to any such supplementation of the administrative\n\nrecord.   We are not reinstating benefits but merely remanding to\n\nthe plan administrator for further consideration of the claim and\n\nmore adequate explanation, but we expect further proceedings by\n\nPartners to proceed with expedition.   Each party to bear its own\n\ncosts.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                  --Dissenting Opinion Follows--\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting. The majority correctly\n\nidentifies the \"double issue\" we face in determining the applicable\n\nstandard of review in this case: first, whether Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Hospital (\"the Hospital\" or \"MGH\") is expressly authorized\n\nby the MGH Long Term Disability Plan (\"the Plan\") to delegate its\n\nauthority to determine benefits, and, second, whether MGH in fact\n\nmade   such    a    delegation   to   the    plan     administrator,     Partners\n\nHealthCare System, Inc. (\"Partners\").               My colleagues answer \"yes\"\n\nto each of those questions.            In so concluding, however, they\n\ndisregard     our    precedent   requiring      a    clear   statement    of   the\n\nauthority to delegate, fail to respect the limits of the pertinent\n\nPlan language, and uncritically accept Partners' declaration of\n\nfiduciary authority despite that assertion's inconsistency with the\n\nterms of the primary plan document.\n\n              In my view, the Plan does not give the Hospital authority\n\nto delegate and, even if it did, Partners' assertion of its own\n\nauthority is insufficient evidence that a proper delegation in fact\n\noccurred.          Hence,   because   neither   question      may   be   answered\n\naffirmatively, the de novo standard of review must be used to\n\nevaluate the administrator's decision denying benefits to Maher.\n\nTaking a fresh view of the record, I can only conclude that Maher's\n\nsymptoms render her incapable of sedentary work.                    I would thus\n\nvacate the district court's judgment and remand for entry of\n\njudgment in Maher's favor.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f                                         I.\n\n              Maher challenged the termination of her benefits under\n\nsection   502    of   the    Employee    Retirement       Income   Security   Act\n\n(\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(a)(1)(B).                ERISA does not prescribe a\n\nstandard of review for such actions.               To fill this gap, the Supreme\n\nCourt   has    held   that    a   denial      of    benefits   challenged   under\n\nsection 1132(a)(1)(B) should be reviewed de novo \"unless the\n\nbenefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary\n\nauthority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the\n\nterms of the plan.\"     Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S.\n\n101, 115 (1989). Where such authority is given, our review is more\n\ndeferential, id. at 111, and a benefits decision will be upheld\n\nunless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion,\"\n\nCusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, 592 F.3d 215, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2010) (quoting Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 360 F.3d\n\n211, 213 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n              The standard of review inquiry must thus start with the\n\nterms of the Plan, through which MGH provided Maher LTD benefits.\n\nArticle 6.1 of the Plan document states in full:\n\n              6.1. General. The processing of claims and\n              calculation of benefits shall be the sole\n              responsibility of the Claims Processor. The\n              Hospital   shall   have  full   discretionary\n              authority to administer the Plan, including\n              without limitation the authority to determine\n              eligibility for benefits, construe the terms\n              and conditions of the Plan, and resolve\n              disputes as to the interpretation of the Plan\n              documents.    Any person having an interest\n\n                                        -17-\n\f           under the Plan m[a]y request a determination\n           by the Hospital with respect to any matter\n           affecting   such   person,    and   any   such\n           determination of the Hospital will be final\n           and binding, and shall not be subject to de\n           novo review, or be modified, amended, or set\n           aside by any judicial or administrative\n           authority in the absence of clear and\n           convincing evidence that the Hospital's action\n           was arbitrary and capricious or without\n           rational basis.\n\nThe Plan document defines the \"Hospital\" to mean The General\n\nHospital Corporation, a Massachusetts charitable organization\n\nwhose sole member is MGH.    Because the above provision grants the\n\nHospital \"full discretionary authority to administer the Plan,\"\n\nincluding \"the authority to determine eligibility for benefits\n\n[and] construe the terms and conditions of the Plan,\" a benefits\n\ndecision by MGH would typically be reviewed under the deferential\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" standard.     Firestone, 489 U.S. at 115;\n\nCusson, 592 F.3d at 224.\n\n           The benefits decision at issue here was not, however,\n\nmade by MGH.     Instead, it was made by Partners, the Plan's\n\nadministrator.   To be sure, Partners and the Hospital are closely\n\nrelated.     Partners,   a   nonprofit   corporation,   coordinates   a\n\nhealthcare system made up of a number of constituent medical\n\ninstitutions, including MGH, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and\n\nvarious other hospitals and medical organizations. However closely\n\nbound together, though, there is no question that Partners and the\n\nHospital are legally distinct entities, and the Plan does not argue\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthat the discretionary authority conferred on the Hospital should\n\nbe imputed to Partners.7      Cf. Glotzer v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 1 F.\n\nApp'x 740, 742 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that, because successor\n\ncorporation inherited in full the rights and burdens of plan\n\nadministrator    through     purchase,   discretion       delegated   to    plan\n\nadministrator was imputed to successor).\n\n           Instead,   the     Plan   contends      that    Partners    validly\n\nexercised discretionary authority that had been delegated to it by\n\nthe Hospital.      ERISA provides that a named fiduciary may delegate\n\nto others its responsibilities under a plan -- other than trustee\n\nresponsibilities -- where the plan expressly sets forth procedures\n\nfor doing so.     29 U.S.C. ยง 1105(c)(1); Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase\n\nManhattan Bank, 986 F.2d 580, 584 (1st Cir. 1993).              To determine\n\nwhether a valid delegation of authority took place here, we must\n\naddress   the   majority's    \"double    issue\":    (1)    whether    the   Plan\n\nauthorized the Hospital to delegate its authority to Partners and,\n\nif so, (2) whether there is adequate evidence of the claimed\n\ndelegation of authority.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       To the extent the majority is suggesting that the Plan's\nargument for deferential review is strengthened by this alternative\ntheory -- i.e., that MGH and Partners are affiliated entities\nbetween whom delegation is unnecessary -- the suggestion is\ngratuitous given that the Plan did not offer the theory. Moreover,\nif the Plan, a sophisticated litigant, thought such a view of the\nentities' relationship was viable, it presumably would have made\nthe claim to avoid relying solely on an approach that even the\nmajority considers justified \"perhaps only by a modest margin.\"\n\n                                     -19-\n\fA.    Was Delegation Authorized?\n\n              A     plan     fiduciary      may     delegate     its        fiduciary\n\nresponsibilities to a third party only where the plan \"expressly\n\nprovide[s] for procedures\" for such a delegation.                      29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1105(c)(1). As explained in Wallace v. Johnson & Johnson, 585 F.3d\n\n11, 15 (1st Cir. 2009), our court has placed little emphasis on the\n\nstatute's reference to delegation \"procedures.\" That is, we do not\n\nrequire that a plan establish any procedures governing delegation\n\nbeyond a basic grant of the authority to delegate itself.                     See id.\n\n(\"Our   own       cases    treat   delegation      'authority'   and     delegation\n\n'procedures' as more or less the same thing . . . .\").                       However,\n\nthe statute's        reference      to   \"expressly    provid[ing]\" delegation\n\nprocedures means that such a grant of authority to delegate must be\n\nclearly stated.           This is consonant both with the requirement that\n\nthe   initial       grant    of    discretionary     authority   by     a    plan   be\n\nunambiguous, see Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); Rodriguez-Abreu, 986 F.2d at 583, and with our case law\n\nexamining plan language granting authority to delegate.\n\n              In Wallace, we found a valid delegation of discretionary\n\nauthority where it was \"clear\" that the benefits plan at issue\n\n\"purport[ed] to allow delegation.\"                585 F.3d at 14.      The relevant\n\nlanguage of the plan stated that the fiduciary \"may '[d]elegate its\n\nauthority established' by the Plan, 'designate persons to assist in\n\ncarrying out fiduciary duties,' 'allocate responsibility for the\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\foperation and administration' of the Plan, and '[a]ppoint persons\n\nor committees to assist it to perform its duties' under the Plan.\"\n\nId. at 14-15.       We reached the same conclusion in Terry, where the\n\nplan       stated   that   \"'[t]he   Company   may   appoint   one   or   more\n\nindividuals to act on its behalf, in which case every reference\n\nherein made to the Company shall be deemed to mean or include the\n\nindividuals as to matters within their jurisdiction.'\" 145 F.3d at\n\n37-38.       In each of these cases, the plan language was unambiguous\n\nand unqualified in its grant of authority to delegate.\n\n               Here, in contrast, the Plan cannot be read to authorize\n\na delegation of plenary administrative authority over the Plan to\n\nPartners.       The most relevant provision of the Plan document, and\n\nthe one emphasized by the Plan,8 reads as follows:\n\n               6.3. Employment of Agents. The Hospital may\n               employ agents, including but not limited to, a\n               Claims Processor, accountants, attorneys or\n               actuaries to perform such services and duties\n               in connection with the administration of the\n               Plan as it may direct. . . . The Hospital\n               shall be fully protected in acting upon the\n\n\n\n       8\n       The Plan contains another potentially relevant provision,\nArticle 6.4, which provides authority for the Hospital to \"delegate\nto the Claims Processor responsibility for certifying the\ninformation and amount necessary for the proper payment of claims\nfrom the Fund under the provisions of the Plan.\" The Plan does not\ncontend, however, that the Hospital's authority to delegate its\ndiscretionary authority to Partners arises from this provision.\nThis is because the delegation authorized in Article 6.4 is a\nlimited one relating to claims processing duties, and, as discussed\nbelow, the authority that may be delegated to the Claims Processor\nunder the Plan falls short of the sort of administrative authority\nthat will trigger deferential review.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f              advice of any such agent, in whole or in\n              part . . . .\n\nUnlike the plan language in Terry and Wallace, the provision here\n\nauthorizes no complete devolution of the discretionary authority\n\ngranted to the Hospital under Article 6.1 of the Plan.                      Rather,\n\nArticle 6.3 allows the Hospital to \"employ\" agents, often referred\n\nto as service providers in ERISA parlance, whose activities it may\n\n\"direct,\" to assist with the day-to-day operation of the Plan and\n\nto   advise    the   Hospital   in   carrying      out   the   fiduciary     duties\n\nassigned to it in Article 6.1.                In Terry, in the course of\n\ndetermining whether a third-party claims processor could be sued as\n\na fiduciary under ERISA for its role in denying the claimant\n\nbenefits, we drew a sharp distinction between these types of \"third\n\nparty   service      provider[s],\"    on     the   one   hand,   and    the   plan\n\nadministrator and fiduciaries, on the other.               145 F.3d at 35-36.\n\n              The reference to a \"Claims Processor\" as one of the\n\nagents the Hospital may employ reflects the limited nature of the\n\ndelegation authorized by Article 6.3, and, critically, that it does\n\nnot include the ultimate authority to \"determine eligibility for\n\nbenefits or to construe the terms of the plan\" -- the authority\n\nthat triggers deferential review.            Firestone, 489 U.S. at 115.          A\n\nclaims processor generally makes the initial determination on a\n\nbenefits claim and may handle the first level of appeals, but\n\nanother   entity      is   usually    responsible        for   making   a     final\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fdetermination on appeal.9         In the typical instance, we have thus\n\nnoted that \"an entity which merely processes claims 'is not a\n\nfiduciary because such person does not have discretionary authority\n\nor discretionary control respecting management of the plan.'\"\n\nTerry, 145 F.3d at 35-36 (quoting 29 C.F.R. ยง 2509.75-8, D-2\n\n(1997)).         Such is plainly the case under the Plan.       Article 6.1\n\nsets       the   Hospital's   authority   side-by-side   with   the   Claims\n\nProcessor's.         It makes clear that, though \"[t]he processing of\n\nclaims and calculation of benefits shall be the sole responsibility\n\nof the Claims Processor,\" it is the Hospital that has \"full\n\ndiscretionary authority to administer the Plan, including without\n\nlimitation the authority to determine eligibility for benefits,\n\nconstrue the terms and conditions of the Plan, and resolve disputes\n\nas to the interpretation of the Plan documents.\"\n\n                 Accordingly, I read Article 6.3 to authorize delegation\n\nof administrative functions short of the Hospital's core authority\n\nto \"determine eligibility for benefits\" and \"construe the terms and\n\nconditions of the Plan.\"10        At a minimum, if this provision were\n\n\n       9\n       Here, for instance, Liberty (acting as claims processor)\nmade the initial benefits determination and processed Maher's first\nappeal, but, upon Maher's second and final appeal, Partners made\nthe ultimate determination to deny.\n       10\n        In relying on Pettaway v. Teachers Insurance and Annuity\nAss'n of America, 644 F.3d 427 (D.C. Cir. 2011), for the\nproposition that decisional authority to determine benefits can be\ninferred from plan language, the majority fails to take seriously\nthe \"clear statement\" standard in our case law. Whether or not the\nlanguage in Pettaway would meet that standard, the language here\n\n                                     -23-\n\fintended to permit the delegation of the totality of the Hospital's\n\ndiscretionary authority, it lacks the requisite clarity.                  Cf.\n\nTerry, 145 F.3d at 37 (\"[T]he grant of discretionary authority must\n\nbe clear.\").    I thus conclude that Article 6.3 did not authorize\n\nthe Hospital's delegation of discretionary authority to Partners.\n\nHowever, as discussed below, even if the Plan permitted such\n\ndelegation,    the   evidence   that    a   delegation     took   place    is\n\ninadequate.\n\n\n\n\ndoes not.     The Pettaway      court    described   the    relevant      plan\nprovisions as follows:\n\n     As stated in the Plan Document, the \"Academy shall be the\n     Plan Administrator and the 'Named Fiduciary'\" with the\n     \"absolute power, authority and discretion to administer\n     the [Academy] Plan.\" Plan Document at 3.1, 3.2. \"All\n     interpretations of the Plan, and questions concerning its\n     administration and application, shall be determined\" by\n     the Academy, which has the authority to \"appoint such\n     accountants, counsel, specialists, and other persons as\n     it deems necessary or desirable in connection with the\n     administration of the Plan.\" [Plan Document] at 3.2.\n\nPettaway, 644 F.3d at 434. Thus, unlike the MGH Plan, delegation\nunder the plan in Pettaway was not limited to \"agents\" whom the\nadministrator would \"direct.\" See supra pp. 21-22. Instead, the\nPettaway   administrator   had   broad   authority    to   delegate\nadministrative responsibility to others whenever such a transfer of\nduties was \"deem[ed] necessary or desirable.\"\n\n     The limited language in the MGH Plan renders irrelevant the\nmajority's observation that lawyers, accountants and actuaries may\nbe assigned fiduciary duties. The issue here is not whether such\nprofessionals are considered fiduciaries, but whether this Plan\nclearly endorsed delegation of the authority to make final benefits\ndeterminations.\n\n                                  -24-\n\fB.   Did a Delegation Occur?\n\n           The   Plan   asserts    that    evidence   of   a    delegation    of\n\nauthority to Partners can be found in a 2005 document entitled\n\n\"Partners HealthCare System, Inc. Health and Welfare Plan Document\"\n\n(the \"Partners Plan Document\"), which the Plan characterizes as a\n\nSummary Plan Description (\"SPD\").           The document, published under\n\nPartners' name, purports to be \"a wrap-around plan document that\n\ncontains   the    definitions,      participation     and       administration\n\nprovisions of the various Partners health and welfare plans,\" which\n\nincludes the Plan at issue here as well as over forty others, \"and\n\nincorporates by reference the various Benefit Contracts associated\n\nwith the Plan to form a complete plan document.\"                 The language\n\nsupposedly effecting the delegation, located in Section II, Article\n\nIX of the Partners Plan Document, simply states, \"Partners acts as\n\nthe Plan Administrator for ERISA purposes of the Plans.\"                     The\n\nPartners   Plan    Document       further     provides      that,    as     Plan\n\nAdministrator,    Partners   \"has   the     discretion     to   determine    all\n\nmatters relating to eligibility, coverage and benefits under each\n\nPlan\" and \"has the full power to interpret each Plan and is\n\nresponsible for the operation of each Plan.\"\n\n           Our cases involving delegation of fiduciary authority\n\nunder ERISA do not directly address what sort of evidence will\n\nsuffice to show that delegation has been effected. To some extent,\n\nthe answer in an individual case may depend upon whether the ERISA\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fplan at issue sets forth particular procedures to canalize the\n\ndelegation process.       However, often, as here, the plan will not\n\nspecify a mechanism for delegation. In these cases, our precedents\n\nhint at some basic guidelines for determining whether the evidence\n\nbefore the court establishes the delegation of fiduciary authority.\n\n           First, it is not enough merely to show that the putative\n\ndelegate   is    carrying    out    discretionary        functions    of    plan\n\nadministration.       In Rodriguez-Abreu, a senior executive of the\n\ndefendant employer conducted a review of the denial of plaintiff's\n\nbenefits   and    corresponded     with     the   plaintiff     regarding   his\n\neligibility.     986 F.2d at 582, 584.            The defendant argued that\n\nthese circumstances alone were sufficient to show that the plan\n\nfiduciaries     had   delegated    their    discretion    to   the   executive,\n\ntriggering a deferential standard of review. We disagreed. Noting\n\nthat there was \"no expression of intent that [the executive] act as\n\nthe delegate of the Fiduciaries\" in the plan documents or elsewhere\n\nin   the record, we found no valid delegation of authority and thus\n\nemployed a de novo standard of review.            Id. at 584.\n\n           Second, evidence of the delegation may be provided by a\n\nwritten instrument other than the plan documents themselves.                 In\n\nTerry, the benefit plan at issue conferred discretionary authority\n\nto administer the plan to the Bayer Corporation, and Bayer in turn\n\ndelegated that authority to an internal \"Benefit Administration\n\nCommittee.\"      145 F.3d at 37-38.           The only evidence of this\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fdelegation        was     an      internal         organizational          document     (the\n\n\"Administrative           Procedures         for     the        Benefit    Administration\n\nCommittee\"),          which,    among    other       things,       explained     that     the\n\nCommittee       had    been    formed    to    \"'act       on    behalf    of   [Bayer]    by\n\nassisting [Bayer] in fulfilling its administrative duties which are\n\nset forth in the employee benefit plans.'\"                          Id. at 35, 38.        We\n\nfound this \"clear and direct delegation -- by written instrument --\n\nfrom the Plan Administrator to the Benefit Committee\" sufficient to\n\njustify a deferential standard of review.                          Id. at 38; see also\n\nWallace, 585 F.3d at 14-15 (holding extra-plan written instrument\n\ntransferring discretionary authority to administer plan to third\n\nparty sufficient evidence of valid delegation to trigger review\n\nunder the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard).\n\n                Here, we have a written document -- the Partners Plan\n\nDocument -- that purportedly gives to Partners the discretionary\n\nauthority to administer the Plan.                   However, the relevant terms in\n\nthe Partners Plan Document represent nothing more than the bare\n\nassertion       by    a   third      party    of    discretionary          authority    over\n\nadministration of the Plan.                   The document states simply that\n\n\"Partners acts as the Plan Administrator\" for all plans listed\n\namong     its    pages,11      and   that     Partners      \"has     the    discretion    to\n\n\n     11\n        As Maher points out, the Partners Plan Document never\naccurately refers to the Plan. In a table detailing the various\nsubsidiary plans to which it applies, the Partners Plan Document\nlists an \"MGH LTD Insurance Plan.\" The Plan is not, in fact, an\ninsurance plan, as it is funded through a trust, and thus the\n\n                                             -27-\n\fdetermine    all   matters    relating   to    eligibility,    coverage   and\n\nbenefits under each Plan\" and \"has the full power to interpret each\n\nPlan and is responsible for the operation of each Plan.\"             This is\n\nat best corroborative evidence of a transfer of authority from the\n\nHospital to Partners, but insufficient on its own to establish the\n\ndelegation.    The Plan has offered no evidence of an agreement\n\nbetween the Hospital and Partners, a corporate resolution by the\n\nHospital, or other such documentation that would indicate that the\n\nHospital affirmatively granted discretionary authority over the\n\nPlan to Partners.\n\n            In arguing over the effect of the Partners Plan Document,\n\nthe parties vigorously dispute whether it properly qualifies as an\n\nSPD for the Plan.12    This is a question that need not be resolved\n\nhere, as nothing turns on it.       Even if the Partners Plan Document\n\nqualified as an SPD, there would be a direct conflict with the\n\nprimary Plan document that must be resolved in the Plan document's\n\nfavor.      Each   document   purports    to    grant   full   discretionary\n\nauthority over the Plan, with the power to make \"final and binding\"\n\ndecisions, to a different entity.              Where there is a conflict\n\n\nreference to an \"LTD Insurance Plan\" is erroneous.\n     12\n       Maher argues at some length that the Partners Plan Document\nfails to include all categories of information required by statute\nto be present in an SPD.     See 29 U.S.C. ยง 1022(b).     The Plan\ncounters that the Partners Plan Document explicitly states that it\nis only one of several documents that \"collectively constitute the\nsummary plan description for each Plan,\" implying that those\nadditional documents supply the missing information.\n\n                                   -28-\n\fbetween the plan and the SPD, the plan language will generally\n\ncontrol, except in situations where the beneficiary relied to her\n\ndetriment on the SPD.        See Ringwald v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,\n\n609 F.3d 946,      948-49     (8th   Cir.    2010)    (disregarding     grant of\n\ndiscretionary authority that appeared only in SPD); Schwartz v.\n\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 450 F.3d 697, 699-700 (7th Cir. 2006)\n\n(same,    and     explaining     that     SPD    controls    if    participant\n\ndetrimentally relied on it); cf. Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension\n\nPlan for Salaried Emps., 239 F.3d 51, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2001) (where\n\nSPD conflicts with a plan's terms, the SPD will control if the\n\nclaimant demonstrates \"significant or reasonable reliance\" on the\n\nSPD).     Thus,   to   the   extent     that    the   Partners   Plan   Document\n\nqualifies as an SPD, the grant of discretionary authority in the\n\nPlan document must still be credited over the conflicting grant in\n\nthe putative SPD.13\n\n           In sum, the Plan by its terms did not authorize the\n\nHospital to delegate its authority, and, even if the Plan had\n\npermitted such delegation, there is insufficient evidence that the\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       The majority fails to confront the inconsistency between the\ndocuments and, indeed, cites the Partners Plan Document as evidence\nthat the Hospital was authorized to delegate its discretionary\nauthority.    But a bare assertion of authority by the putative\ndelegee is even less meaningful as proof that delegation was\nauthorized than it is as evidence that a delegation in fact\noccurred. In effect, the majority assumes that Partners' assertion\nthat it had authority is evidence that it was given that authority.\nSuch circular reasoning is both illogical and unpersuasive.\n\n                                      -29-\n\fHospital in fact delegated its authority to Partners.                    Partners'\n\ndenial of Maher's benefits must therefore be reviewed de novo.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            In a de novo review of a benefits decision, \"no deference\n\n[is given] to administrators' opinions or conclusions based on\n\nthe[] facts.\"      Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404 F.3d 510,\n\n518 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Richards v. Hewlett-Packard Corp.,\n\n592 F.3d 232, 239 (1st Cir. 2010) (same).           Instead, an independent\n\nreview of    the    evidence   in   the    administrative       record    must   be\n\nperformed, Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 518; Richards, 592 F.3d at 239, and\n\nthe \"guiding principle\" is that the plaintiff bears the burden of\n\nproving he is disabled, Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 518-19.               To meet that\n\nburden, the terms of the Plan require Maher to prove a \"complete\n\nincapacity\" preventing her \"from performing any and every duty of\n\nany   occupation    or   employment,      for   which   [she]    is   reasonably\n\nqualified by education, training or experience.\"                  The Plan has\n\nnarrowed the scope of the inquiry somewhat by specifying the\n\noccupations for which it believes Maher to be qualified: telephonic\n\ntriage nurse, nurse case manager, and utilization review nurse.\n\n            Maher's arguments on the merits of the Plan's benefits\n\ndetermination fall into two categories.            First, Maher argues that\n\nher use of narcotics renders her incapable of filling any of the\n\nabove-mentioned jobs for which she is qualified by \"education,\n\ntraining, or experience.\"       In support of this argument she points\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fto state law that purportedly prohibits her from performing any\n\nnursing   duties    while   under    the    influence   of    narcotics.\n\nAlternatively, she submits that, legality aside, the effects of her\n\nmedications would impair her judgment and interfere with her\n\nability to perform nursing duties. Second, Maher contends that the\n\nevidence supports the disability caused by her chronic pain and\n\nnausea, and that Partners wrongly discounted evidence of the manner\n\nand extent to which pain affects her ability to function.\n\n          I address each of these arguments in turn.\n\nA. Disabling Effects of Narcotics Use\n\n          Maher's    medical   records     confirm   that,   for   nearly   a\n\ndecade, Maher has treated pain with a varying array of powerful\n\nnarcotics, and she usually has taken multiple drugs at the same\n\ntime and in significant doses.        In a 2007 letter, Dr. Elizabeth\n\nCuevas, Maher's primary care doctor, noted that her patient is\n\n\"treated with narcotics that are prescribed at very high doses,\"\n\nand Dr. Wolfram Goessling, Maher's treating gastroenterologist, has\n\nsimilarly noted that Maher \"takes impressive amounts of narcotics.\"\n\nOver the course of her treatment, Maher has consulted several pain\n\nclinics and periodically changed medications, but her records\n\nreveal no success in scaling back the use of narcotic painkillers.\n\nAccording to Dr. Herbert Malinoff, one of Liberty's consulting\n\ndoctors, Maher's record of treatment supports a diagnosis of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f\"chemical dependency relative to opioid and Benzodiazepine use over\n\na long period of time.\"\n\n            Maher contends that her drug use, as a matter of law,\n\nprevents her from working in any job within the field of nursing,\n\nand thus precludes employment in the one area for which she is\n\nqualified by education, training, or experience.               As Maher notes,\n\nMassachusetts' Standards of Conduct for licensed nurses prohibit\n\nnurses from practicing \"while impaired.\"             244 Mass. Code Regs.\n\nยง 9.03(36).      Maher argues that the sedentary nursing roles that\n\nLiberty   has    suggested   she    would   be    capable      of   filling   all\n\nnecessarily involve the \"practice\" of nursing, defined by statute\n\nto include \"coordination and management of resources for care\n\ndelivery.\"      Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 112, ยง 80B.            Because she is\n\n\"therapeutically addicted to narcotic medication,\" Maher suggests\n\nthat she is legally \"impaired\" and cannot serve in the above\n\npositions.14\n\n            Though Maher tries to segregate this line of reasoning\n\nfrom her alternative argument that the effects of her medications\n\nwould interfere with her ability to carry out the duties of a\n\nnursing job, they cannot be so easily disentangled.                 The fact of\n\nnarcotics    use does   not,   by   itself,      appear   to    preclude   legal\n\n\n\n     14\n        Because I dispose of Maher's argument based on the\ndefinition of \"impaired,\" I do not address her contention that the\nsedentary nursing roles identified by Liberty involve the\n\"practice\" of nursing under Massachusetts law.\n\n                                    -32-\n\ffunction as a nurse.     The governing regulations define \"impaired\"\n\nto   mean   \"the   inability   to   practice     nursing   with   reasonable\n\njudgment, skill, and safety by reason of alcohol or drug abuse, use\n\nof substances, a physical or mental illness or condition, or by any\n\ncombination of the foregoing.\"      244 Mass. Code Regs. ยง 9.02.       Thus,\n\nwhether Maher is \"impaired\" turns not on whether she is addicted to\n\nnarcotics, but on a factual determination of whether her narcotic\n\nuse is likely to interfere with her \"judgment [and] skill.\"             Id.\n\n            The evidence of the effect of Maher's narcotic use on her\n\nability to concentrate and function is mixed.              There is, to be\n\nsure, an intuitive logic to the notion that we should be wary of\n\nentrusting patient care to a medical professional who takes large\n\namounts of narcotic medications.            This is a point that Maher\n\nemphasizes in her briefs, and it has some basis in fact.             Medical\n\nauthorities    warn   that   narcotics     may   cause   sedation,   \"mental\n\nclouding,\" and impaired psychomotor function.            However, according\n\nto a publication of the American Medical Association included in\n\nthe administrative record, these types of side effects \"usually\n\ndissipate with continued treatment, normally within a week with\n\nregularly scheduled dosing, and studies have demonstrated that most\n\npatients on chronic opioid therapy can safely drive cars.\"            One of\n\nLiberty's consulting physicians, Dr. Robert Millstein, makes the\n\nsame point in his February 2007 report, though he acknowledges\n\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f\"very   few    studies   have   examined    the      effects   of   opioids   on\n\nselective, divided, and sustained attention.\"\n\n              Maher's medical records indicate that she has often\n\ncomplained of the sedation brought on by her regimen of narcotics.\n\nHowever, close scrutiny of these records indicates that many of her\n\nreports of somnolence and other drug-related side effects are\n\ncorrelated with a change in medication or an adjustment of dosage.\n\nTo take one example, Maher saw Dr. Goessling in March 2005 and\n\ncomplained that the morphine she was taking made her \"loopy and\n\nmore sleepy than usual.\"        Her medical records reveal that she was\n\nstarted on morphine only a couple of days prior, when she was\n\nadmitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and the pain clinicians\n\nrecommended that she transition from OxyContin.\n\n              Overall, I do not find convincing support in the record\n\nfor the proposition that Maher's drug use, by itself, would render\n\nher incapable of working in one of the sedentary nursing positions\n\nidentified      by   Liberty.     There    is   no    clear    prohibition    in\n\nMassachusetts on serving as a nurse while on a medically prescribed\n\nregimen of narcotics, so long as the drugs do not impair the\n\nnurse's \"judgment, skill, and safety.\"            Maher's doctors have not\n\nsuggested that her use of drugs would interfere with her judgment\n\nor ability to make rational decisions.            Indeed, Dr. Goessling and\n\nDr. Cuevas both identify excessive sedation to be the major side\n\neffect associated with Maher's medication.            I acknowledge that Dr.\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\fGoessling has opined that he \"cannot imagine that it would be in\n\n[Maher's] or society's benefit to have her work as a nurse making\n\ndecisions over other people's lives,\" but he does not point to any\n\nspecific effect of the drugs that would render Maher incapable of\n\nsafely managing the limited nursing roles suggested for her by\n\nLiberty.\n\n                I am not unconcerned by the possibility that narcotic-\n\nrelated sedation would make it difficult for Maher to complete a\n\nregular workday.         In one instance in 2005, Maher reported that the\n\nsomnolence associated with a change from OxyContin to Palladone was\n\ncausing her to take three naps per day. Such considerable sedation\n\nwould clearly interfere with most if not all possible employment.\n\nHowever, because Maher's reports of drowsiness and other adverse\n\neffects from medication appear largely related to alterations in\n\nher drug regimen -- which conforms to the medical evidence that\n\nside effects are most pronounced when first starting a narcotic --\n\nI    do   not     see    convincing     evidence   that     Maher's    ability   to\n\nconcentrate        and       exercise   judgment    would     be    significantly\n\ncompromised        by    a    regular    and    stable    program     of   narcotic\n\nmedications.\n\nB.    Disabling Effects of Pain and Other Symptoms\n\n                I reach a different conclusion with respect to the impact\n\nof the symptoms of Maher's maladies -- chronic pain, nausea,\n\nvomiting, and food intolerance -- on her ability to work.                    After\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fcareful review of the record, I find persuasive evidence that\n\nMaher's symptoms would prevent her from performing the duties of\n\nthe jobs identified by Liberty.\n\n             Before evaluating the record on this issue, I note that\n\nmy concern here lies with the evidence of limitations attributable\n\nto Maher's symptoms, and not with whether the evidence supports\n\nMaher's underlying medical conditions.             There is considerable\n\nuncertainty regarding the etiology of Maher's abdominal pain and\n\nother complaints, and attempting to resolve a question that has\n\nstymied multiple doctors for the past decade is both unnecessary\n\nand beyond my expertise.15     The diagnosis makes little difference\n\nhere.     Our court has emphasized before that in dealing with hard-\n\nto-diagnose, pain-related conditions, it is not reasonable to\n\nexpect or require objective evidence supporting the beneficiary's\n\nclaimed diagnosis.     See Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320\n\nF.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2003).     Our focus instead must be on whether\n\nevidence supports     an   inability   to   work   due to   \"the physical\n\nlimitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses . . . .\"\n\nBoardman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 337 F.3d 9, 16 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n\n     15\n         Dr. Goessling, a trained gastroenterologist and Associate\nProfessor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, continues to\nbelieve that Maher's abdominal symptoms are most likely caused by\nchronic pancreatitis.   The Plan's doctors disagree, but concede\nthat the record supports a diagnosis of either \"chronic pain\nsyndrome with abdominal focus,\" per Dr. Malinoff, or fibromyalgia,\nper Dr. Millstein.\n\n                                  -36-\n\f               1.     Evidence Relied upon by the Plan\n\n               I begin by assessing the evidence that, in the view of\n\nthe Plan, calls Maher's limitations into question, the foremost of\n\nwhich     is    the    alleged   inconsistency   between   Maher's   reported\n\ncapabilities and the level of activity confirmed by surveillance.\n\nLiberty conducted surveillance of Maher on nineteen days between\n\nOctober 2002 and October 2006, portions of which were recorded on\n\nvideo.16 The Plan and its doctors highlighted a handful of examples\n\nof increased activity by Maher captured in the surveillance.               On\n\none occasion, Maher was observed walking to the front of her\n\nproperty \"carrying what appeared to be a flower / plant and a large\n\nbucket,\" and, four minutes later, walking back with the same\n\nbucket.        On another, she drove herself a short distance (a four-\n\nminute drive) to a local school, where she went inside and returned\n\ncarrying her son (then close to three years old), whom she placed\n\ninside the car before departing for her home.            On a third occasion\n\n-- and the one on which the Plan places the most emphasis --\n\nMaher's husband drove Maher and her son to a local soccer field on\n\na Saturday morning. There, Maher \"was periodically observed as she\n\nand her husband flew a kite with the young boy,\" as she \"walked and\n\njogged around the soccer field,\" and as she \"at one point lifted\n\n\n\n\n     16\n       This included six days of surveillance in 2002, three days\nin 2005, and ten days in 2006.\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthe small boy and swung him around in her arms.\"   The outing lasted\n\nthirty-four minutes.\n\n           This surveillance evidence does not have the significance\n\nthat the Plan ascribes to it.   In the activity questionnaires she\n\nsubmitted to Liberty, Maher consistently reported that the level of\n\nactivity she can sustain is entirely dependent on her pain, nausea,\n\nand level of medication. For example, in her latest questionnaire,\n\ndated September 2006, Maher indicated that the amount of time she\n\ncan tolerate sitting, standing, and riding in or driving a car\n\ndepends on the presence of pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nShe also noted that she leaves the house during the week two to\n\nthree times a day (one to two times on weekend days), and that she\n\nhelps take care of her children and perform small chores when she\n\nis able.\n\n           As the majority points out, Liberty's surveillance is not\n\ninconsistent with Maher's own account of her activities.       Over\n\nnineteen days of surveillance, there were a number of days in which\n\nMaher was confirmed to be at home and never left the residence.   On\n\nother days, she left the house -- either as a passenger or driving\n\nherself -- to run a limited number of errands, mostly picking up or\n\ndropping off her children at school, and once to go to dinner at a\n\nrestaurant.   She was also observed outside on two brief occasions\n\ninvolved in what could generously be described as yard chores:\n\ncarrying a flower pot and, on another occasion, sitting in the bed\n\n\n                                -38-\n\fof her husband's truck holding a broom or rake while her husband\n\nappeared to be cleaning up.         All of this activity is consistent\n\nwith her description of a low level of activity dependent on the\n\nebb and flow of her symptoms.       It would be unusual for a mother of\n\nthree children to be able to avoid all activity.\n\n             With regard to the kite-flying episode, which strays the\n\nfarthest from Maher's reported limitations, Maher has indicated\n\nthat the outing was a \"special event\" for which she premedicated\n\nwith morphine.       In other circumstances, this explanation might\n\nstrain     credulity.       Here,   however,     the   notion   that     Maher\n\npremedicates to prepare for activities that may trigger pain finds\n\nsupport in records that predate the incident.17            In a March 2003\n\nactivity questionnaire, for example, Maher noted that she travels\n\nby   plane   only   with   \"pre-medication     for   pain and   nausea    from\n\nincreased cabin pressure on abdomen.\"                In her September 2006\n\nquestionnaire, Maher also noted that her ability to carry out\n\nvarious activities of daily life \"always depend[s] on how much pain\n\nmedicine I use . . . to help myself.\"          Moreover, the entire outing\n\n\n\n      17\n        The district court concluded that, assuming that Maher's\nouting with her family can be explained by premedication, \"it is a\nreasonable inference that she could also pre-medicate to perform a\nsedentary job.\" I cannot agree. Maher takes a large amount of\nnarcotics daily to address her background pain. The fact that she\ncan, on top of this background dosage, take additional pain\nmedications to ward off pain during the occasional short episodes\nof increased activity does not suggest that it would be feasible\nfor her to regularly take extra medication to make it through an\neight-hour workday.\n\n                                    -39-\n\fat the athletic fields was very brief, lasting just over half an\n\nhour.   It would be unfair to read too much into one short episode\n\nof increased activity, given the consistency of the larger record\n\nof surveillance with Maher's reported capabilities.\n\n           Turning   to    an     evaluation    of    the    medical   opinions\n\nconcerning Maher's limitations, my conclusion again diverges from\n\nthat of the Plan and its doctors.          Among Maher's treating doctors,\n\nthere is thin support for her capacity to return to a sedentary\n\njob.    The most direct evidence is found in a questionnaire,\n\ncompleted by Dr. Gale Haydock, indicating that Maher is \"OK to\n\nperform sedentary duties.\" However, Dr. Haydock treated Maher only\n\nonce, in the winter of 2006, when Maher was admitted to the\n\nhospital for several days to treat a flare-up of abdominal pain,\n\nand thus Dr. Haydock had no opportunity to observe the course of\n\nMaher's symptoms over time.\n\n           One could also, as the Plan has, read various statements\n\nby Maher's primary care physician (Dr. Cuevas) to support Maher's\n\nability to perform sedentary work. Most notably, in a conversation\n\nwith Dr.     Malinoff,   Dr.    Cuevas   stated      her   agreement   with Dr.\n\nMalinoff's    opinion     that,    \"from    a   purely      internal   medicine\n\nperspective, there is no identifiable physical exam or anatomic /\n\nlaboratory abnormality that would prevent [Maher] from working at\n\na very minimum at a sedentary level.\"                 This awkwardly precise\n\nstatement is technically true and is, undoubtedly, an accurate\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\freflection       of    Dr.     Cuevas's     medical    opinion.18           It   is    also\n\ntransparently misleading.              Maher's medical records make clear that\n\nno    doctor    has     been    able   to   identify    a     physical      or   anatomic\n\nabnormality that causes her symptoms.                  However, the absence of a\n\ndiagnosed medical condition says nothing about the reliability of\n\nMaher's complaints or whether her reported symptoms prevent her\n\nfrom    working.         On    those     questions,    Dr.    Cuevas's       opinion     is\n\nunequivocal.          In a letter dated March 2007, Dr. Cuevas wrote that\n\nMaher \"remains in significant disability, both from her chronic\n\npain and from the side effects the pain medication cause,\" and that\n\nshe \"is unable to reliably perform duties because her pain can\n\nbecome so severe so quickly.\"\n\n               Lastly, the record also contains opinions from the three\n\ndoctors retained by the Plan -- Dr. Millstein, Dr. Malinoff, and\n\nDr.    Dean    Hashimoto,        Chief    of   Occupational         and    Environmental\n\nMedicine at MGH -- concluding that the available evidence does not\n\nsupport Maher's claimed inability to work a sedentary job.                            I find\n\nthe opinions rendered by these doctors unpersuasive.                         Each doctor\n\nrelied to a significant degree on the surveillance records in\n\nevaluating      Maher's        capabilities,       focusing    on    the    episodes     of\n\nactivity detailed above and finding them inconsistent with Maher's\n\n\n\n       18\n       Following their conversation, Dr. Malinoff mailed a letter\nto Dr. Cuevas that recapitulated the substance of their\nconversation and asked that she sign to verify its accuracy. She\ndid so and returned the letter to Dr. Malinoff.\n\n                                            -41-\n\fclaims.      Dr. Malinoff and Dr. Hashimoto also interpreted Dr.\n\nCuevas's statements as supportive of Maher's ability to return to\n\nwork.     For the reasons stated, I have reached contrary conclusions\n\nbased on the same evidence.         Additionally, Dr. Hashimoto observed\n\nthat, even accepting the veracity of Maher's reported symptoms,\n\nthere has been no attempt to evaluate \"through neuropsych testing,\n\nscans, or other available means\" the extent to which Maher's pain\n\nand use of narcotics affect her cognition and ability to function.\n\nThis failing can be attributed, to some degree, to the Plan's\n\ndecision not to pursue an independent medical evaluation of Maher\n\nto assist in the assessment of her claim.19                Nevertheless, as I\n\ndiscuss below, I find the record evidence of Maher's limitations\n\nsufficient    even   absent   the   sort    of   testing    suggested   by   Dr.\n\nHashimoto.\n\n\n\n\n     19\n       Indeed, I find the Plan's failure to conduct an independent\nmedical examination somewhat troubling. There is no requirement\nthat a plan administrator arrange for a medical examination prior\nto terminating benefits, see Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 526, but here the\ncircumstances certainly should have suggested its utility.       As\nearly as 2004, Dr. Millstein counseled that \"[i]f it is felt to be\nimportant to ascertain whether impairment due to abdominal pain\nexists, I would suggest consideration of functional assessment by\nsome alternative means.\" After her benefits had been denied, Maher\neven offered to make herself available for a physical examination\nby a doctor of the Plan's choice. The record reflects that the\nPlan's administrators internally discussed the possibility of an\nindependent medical examination in September 2007, but declined to\npursue one due, in part, to concern for slowing down the process.\n\n                                     -42-\n\f          2.   The Evidence Supports Maher's Limitations\n\n          Viewing the totality of the medical evidence in the\n\nadministrative record, I am persuaded that Maher's symptoms prevent\n\nher from reliably performing the duties of a sedentary nursing job.\n\nAt the fore of that evidence are the opinions of Maher's treating\n\ndoctors, Dr. Cuevas and Dr. Goessling.     As noted, Dr. Cuevas's\n\nassessment as of March 2007 was that Maher \"remains in significant\n\ndisability\" and \"is unable to reliably perform duties because her\n\npain can become so severe so quickly.\"   Similarly, Dr. Goessling,\n\nwho has followed Maher since the onset of her abdominal symptoms in\n\nlate 2001, opined in a 2007 letter:\n\n          In her current status, Mrs. Maher is barely\n          able to provide for herself and her 3-year-old\n          son during the day. She is not able to stand\n          or walk for prolonged periods of time. She is\n          suffering from constant nausea that is only\n          partially relieved by her . . . medication.\n          She   has   intermittent   diarrhea   due   to\n          malabsorption from lack of pancreatic enzymes\n          followed by constipation caused by her high\n          doses of narcotics medication. On top of her\n          chronic abdominal pain, she has frequent\n          exacerbations,    [and]   often    this   pain\n          prohibit[s] her completely from taking any\n          solid foods. . . . [ยถ] . . . [L]et me assure\n          that I do not see any way that my patient\n          would be able to sit or stand for prolonged\n          period[s] of time let alone do physically or\n          intellectually demanding work.\n\nWhile there is some evidence that Dr. Goessling did not actively\n\ntreat Maher in 2006 and 2007, he saw her repeatedly in the\n\n\n\n\n                               -43-\n\fpreceding years and she appears to have consulted with him prior to\n\nhis writing the letter quoted above.20\n\n           These    opinions   echo   Maher's    own    assessment    of    her\n\nlimitations.    In an affidavit, Maher stated that she \"cannot be\n\ncounted   on   to   do   anything,\"   because     her   symptoms     come   on\n\nunpredictably and leave her in \"excruciating pain\" that \"is so bad\n\nthat it sucks the wind out of [her].\"           Though pain is subjective\n\nand thus difficult to reliably document, her characterization\n\nappears to be borne out by the record.           From late 2001, she has\n\nconsistently complained of intermittent and severe abdominal pain.\n\nHer complaints have been credible enough to convince the numerous\n\ndoctors who have seen her that she needs serious narcotics to\n\nrelieve her pain and allow her to function.        While we might suspect\n\ndrug-seeking tendencies in such circumstances, the record does not\n\nreveal such tendencies. An early note from Dr. Goessling indicates\n\nthat Maher was \"quite reluctant to take pain medications,\" and\n\nthere are multiple indications in later records of her desire to\n\nmove off of the painkillers.21        Even with her regular regimen of\n\n\n     20\n       The letter, addressed to Maher's case manager at Liberty,\nbegins, \"I would like to update you on [Maher's] overall condition,\nespecially in light of the recent denial letter for her benefits\nthat she received,\" implicitly suggesting that Dr. Goessling had\ncurrent knowledge of Maher's condition at the time of writing.\n     21\n       Still, the record is mixed as to the sincerity of Maher's\ndesire to discontinue narcotic use, as she has twice started\ntreatment with a pain clinic and then failed to follow up. She\nascribes her reluctance to continue treatment at the clinics to\ninterpersonal conflict with the doctors at one clinic, and a\n\n                                  -44-\n\fheavy narcotics, Maher's abdominal pain has repeatedly brought her\n\nto the emergency room, where she was admitted on at least two\n\noccasions for multiple-day stays to manage her pain.\n\n          Maher's record of treatment thus bespeaks significant and\n\ndebilitating pain.   Given the number of medical professionals who\n\nhave examined her and found her distress genuine, I have no reason\n\nto question the reality of this pain.      As the Seventh Circuit noted\n\nin Carradine v. Barnhart, 360 F.3d 751 (7th Cir. 2004):\n\n          What is significant is the improbability that\n          [the claimant] would have undergone the\n          pain-treatment procedures that she did, which\n          included . . . heavy doses of strong drugs\n          . . ., merely in order to strengthen the\n          credibility of her complaints of pain and so\n          increase her chances of obtaining disability\n          benefits; likewise the improbability that she\n          is a good enough actress to fool a host of\n          doctors and emergency-room personnel into\n          thinking she suffers extreme pain; and the\n          (perhaps lesser) improbability that this host\n          of medical workers would prescribe drugs and\n          other treatment for her if they thought she\n          were faking her symptoms. Such an inference\n          would amount to an accusation that the medical\n          workers who treated [the claimant] were\n          behaving unprofessionally.\n\nId. at 755 (internal citation omitted). I therefore credit Maher's\n\nreports   of   abdominal   pain,     and   note   as   well   that   her\n\ngastrointestinal and food intolerance symptoms -- which are more\n\nreadily verified -- find support in numerous records.\n\n\n\nfeeling that the type of program offered by the other clinic was\nnot appropriate for her. Her lack of follow-through in this regard\ndoes not diminish the overall force of the evidence of her pain.\n\n                                   -45-\n\f           I similarly find the evidence sufficient to corroborate\n\nMaher's claims that these symptoms would interfere with her ability\n\nto work.   Maher's recurring acute attacks of abdominal pain would,\n\nat a minimum, result in frequent absences from work, which would be\n\nprohibitively    disruptive    of    any    attempt   to   maintain   regular\n\nemployment.     Surveillance also suggests that her background level\n\nof   symptoms   is    sufficient    to   keep   her   housebound    with   some\n\nfrequency, or to permit only limited levels of activity.               Though\n\nMaher may occasionally run errands, contribute to household chores,\n\nor even recreate with her family for short periods of time, there\n\nis a sharp \"difference between a person's being able to engage in\n\nsporadic physical activities and her being able to work eight hours\n\na day five consecutive days of the week.\"               Id.     On balance, I\n\nconclude that the evidence demonstrates that Maher cannot reliably\n\nperform the duties of a full-time sedentary nursing job.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Based on a close, de novo review of the administrative\n\nrecord, I am persuaded that Maher's abdominal pain and related\n\nsymptoms effectively prevent her \"from performing any and every\n\nduty of any occupation or employment, for which [she] is reasonably\n\nqualified by education, training or experience.\"              Hence, I believe\n\nwe must go beyond vacating the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Plan and remand for entry of judgment in\n\nMaher's favor.       I therefore dissent.\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\f",

Deborah Maher, a registered\n\nnurse, began work at Massachusetts General Hospital (\"MGH\"), in\n\nAugust 2001.      Maher stopped working in November 2001 and, in\n\nFebruary 2002, began receiving disability benefits through MGH's\n\nlong-term disability plan due to chronic abdominal pain and related\n\nsymptoms.1    Her physicians--although never \"entirely clear\" on the\n\ncause--attributed her symptoms to chronic pancreatitis, chronic\n\npain syndrome or fibromyalgia.     Over time, joint pain added to her\n\nwoes, and Maher received \"impressive amounts of narcotics\" to\n\nmanage her pain, which caused some negative side effects.\n\n             In February 2007, Liberty Life Assurance Company of\n\nBoston (\"Liberty\"), the plan's claims processor, terminated Maher's\n\nbenefits.      After a June 2007 letter misquoted plan language,\n\nLiberty concluded in a corrected September 2007 letter that Maher\n\nwas no longer \"totally disabled,\" defined in Section 2.10 of the\n\n\"The Massachusetts General Hospital Long Term Disability Plan\" (the\n\n\"primary plan document\") as\n\n             such complete incapacity, resulting from a\n             medically determinable physical or mental\n             impairment, as prevents the Participant from\n             performing   any  and   every   duty  of   any\n             occupation or employment, for which he is\n             reasonably qualified by education, training or\n             experience.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      We refer to the MGH Long-Term Disability Plan, technically\nthe defendant in this case, as the \"MGH Plan.\" We refer to the\nplan documents and terms as \"the plan.\"\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            This   determination    was   based   in    part    on    medical\n\nassessments    more   fully   described   below   but    also    on    covert\n\nsurveillance video showing Maher driving, walking, jogging, bending\n\nover, flying a kite, and lifting her three-year-old child.                The\n\nmost comprehensive assessment was by Dr. Robert Millstein, a\n\nmedical consultant at Liberty, who based his judgment on review of\n\nMaher's medical file.    He confirmed diagnoses by Maher's personal\n\nphysicians of her fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis but\n\ndetermined that none prevented Maher from working.\n\n            Maher pursued administrative appeals with Liberty and\n\nultimately with Partners HealthCare System, Inc. (\"Partners\"), the\n\nplan's administrator.     She submitted supporting materials, most\n\nnotably March 2007 statements from her personal physician, Dr.\n\nElizabeth     Cuevas,     and      Dr.    Wolfram       Goessling,        her\n\ngastroenterologist. Dr. Cuevas represented that Maher, despite her\n\npain medications, \"remains in significant disability, both from her\n\nchronic pain and from the side effects the pain medication cause,\n\nsuch as somnolence.      She is unable to reliably perform duties\n\nbecause her pain can become so severe so quickly.\"                    And Dr.\n\nGoessling stated that \"I do not see any way that my patient would\n\nbe able to sit or stand for prolonged period[s] of time let alone\n\ndo physically or intellectually demanding work.\"\n\n            During the ensuing appeals, new doctors independently\n\nreviewed Maher's files.         Dr. Herbert Malinoff, conducting the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\findependent assessment on Maher's appeal within Liberty, consulted\n\nwith Dr. Cuevas and Dr. Goessling, but ultimately found Maher's\n\nsymptoms \"far out of proportion to any abnormality identified\n\nphysically\";    Dr.   Dean   Hashimoto,    conducting     the    independent\n\nassessment on Maher's final appeal to Partners, agreed disability\n\nhad not been established.       Broadly speaking, both, along with Dr.\n\nMillstein, believed that the physical data did not explain the\n\ndegree of pain or other symptoms claimed by Maher and found she had\n\nprovided insufficient other evidence of completely debilitating\n\npain.\n\n            Partners formally denied Maher's last appeal in January\n\n2008.    Maher sought review of her benefits termination in federal\n\ncourt under section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(a)(1)(B) (2006).                The district\n\ncourt,   reviewing    the    plan   administrator's     decision    under   a\n\ndeferential \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard, entered summary\n\njudgment for the MGH Plan and upheld the termination of benefits.\n\nMaher v.

But an MGH\nPlan affidavit confirms that the document is the Summary Plan\nDescription, and the document itself describes Partners' role in\nthe administration of several benefits plans--MGH's plan among\nthem--and says that it, together with certain other materials,\n\"constitute[s] the summary plan description for each Plan.\"\n\n                                           -8-\n\ftrust agreement contemplates certain actions being undertaken by\n\nGHC \"or its delegate.\"\n\n              Thus the plan instruments not only make clear that the\n\nplan authorized delegation of fiduciary responsibility to Partners,\n\nbut   also     that     such   delegation     actually       occurred.

The question is whether Maher's\n\nchronic      pain     and/or   narcotics     use    render     her   incapable   of\n\nperforming     the     sedentary   nursing    jobs    suggested      by   Liberty's\n\nconsultant in a \"transferrable skills analysis\" conducted during\n\nthe   review    of     Maher's   benefits;    the    jobs     included    full-time\n\nsedentary work as a telephonic triage nurse, nurse case manager, or\n\nutilization review nurse.\n\n              On Maher's side we have diagnoses of medical ailments\n\nunchallenged by Partners and explicit statements, already quoted,\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fby   her     own   doctors    who    treated      her--one     of    whom    assessed\n\n\"significant disability\" and the other of whom said that she could\n\nnot do      \"physically or intellectually demanding work.\"                  These are,\n\nof course, fairly summary assessments; but the last, if fully\n\ncredited and not contradicted by other evidence, might appear to\n\nrule out even the less physically demanding nurse-related positions\n\nsuggested.\n\n              Yet these assessments of disability also depended on\n\nMaher's self-reporting as to the effects of medication and, more\n\nimportantly,       the    severity   of    her    symptoms.         Maher    has    been\n\nplagued--among       other    things--by         pain,   nausea,     vomiting,       and\n\ndiarrhea.      She has seen a host of doctors, attended pain clinics,\n\nbeen       recurrently    hospitalized,      treated      with      high    doses     of\n\nnarcotics,         and       undergone           pancreatic         and       biliary\n\nsphincterotomies--surgical            procedures         designed      to        relieve\n\npancreatitis.4       So obviously she has serious symptoms;                   but the\n\nquestion remains whether they are disabling, and this brings us to\n\nthe heart of the problem.\n\n              In   some    situations,      the    degree     of    pain    or     other\n\ndysfunction corresponds with what doctors knowing of the malady\n\nwould expect or at least deem within range.                 Dr. Millstein clearly\n\n\n       4\n      Arguably Maher would not suffer such travails merely to\nstrengthen the credibility of a disability claim or be able to fool\nso many doctors over so many years if there were little or no\nserious pain.

It is not apparent to us that any such\n\ninconsistency exists.\n\n          Maher reported that her activity varied based on the\n\nextent of her pain, nausea, and opportunity to pre-medicate for\n\nactivities, but that she generally spent most of her days in bed.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      See Buffonge v.

On 10 of the 19 days on which\n\nsurveillance video is available, Maher engaged in no activity.             On\n\nother days, Maher was shown sitting or standing outside her house\n\nwith her husband for about 20 minutes.\n\n          Thus most of the surveillance, far from contradicting\n\nMaher's disability, seems to confirm her lifestyle as generally\n\nhousebound with occasional, limited activity.               For the brief\n\nperiods of slightly more vigorous activity, Maher may have pre-\n\nmedicated or may have simply been having a \"good day\"--either of\n\nwhich would be consistent with her reported limitations.                   Of\n\ncourse, she    may   have   been   housebound   by    choice--that    is   the\n\ncritical question.

The majority correctly\n\nidentifies the \"double issue\" we face in determining the applicable\n\nstandard of review in this case: first, whether Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Hospital (\"the Hospital\" or \"MGH\") is expressly authorized\n\nby the MGH Long Term Disability Plan (\"the Plan\") to delegate its\n\nauthority to determine benefits, and, second, whether MGH in fact\n\nmade   such    a    delegation   to   the    plan     administrator,     Partners\n\nHealthCare System, Inc. (\"Partners\").               My colleagues answer \"yes\"\n\nto each of those questions.            In so concluding, however, they\n\ndisregard     our    precedent   requiring      a    clear   statement    of   the\n\nauthority to delegate, fail to respect the limits of the pertinent\n\nPlan language, and uncritically accept Partners' declaration of\n\nfiduciary authority despite that assertion's inconsistency with the\n\nterms of the primary plan document.\n\n              In my view, the Plan does not give the Hospital authority\n\nto delegate and, even if it did, Partners' assertion of its own\n\nauthority is insufficient evidence that a proper delegation in fact\n\noccurred.          Hence,   because   neither   question      may   be   answered\n\naffirmatively, the de novo standard of review must be used to\n\nevaluate the administrator's decision denying benefits to Maher.\n\nTaking a fresh view of the record, I can only conclude that Maher's\n\nsymptoms render her incapable of sedentary work.                    I would thus\n\nvacate the district court's judgment and remand for entry of\n\njudgment in Maher's favor.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f                                         I.\n\n              Maher challenged the termination of her benefits under\n\nsection   502    of   the    Employee    Retirement       Income   Security   Act\n\n(\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(a)(1)(B).

Because the above provision grants the\n\nHospital \"full discretionary authority to administer the Plan,\"\n\nincluding \"the authority to determine eligibility for benefits\n\n[and] construe the terms and conditions of the Plan,\" a benefits\n\ndecision by MGH would typically be reviewed under the deferential\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" standard.     Firestone, 489 U.S. at 115;\n\nCusson, 592 F.3d at 224.\n\n           The benefits decision at issue here was not, however,\n\nmade by MGH.     Instead, it was made by Partners, the Plan's\n\nadministrator.   To be sure, Partners and the Hospital are closely\n\nrelated.     Partners,   a   nonprofit   corporation,   coordinates   a\n\nhealthcare system made up of a number of constituent medical\n\ninstitutions, including MGH, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and\n\nvarious other hospitals and medical organizations. However closely\n\nbound together, though, there is no question that Partners and the\n\nHospital are legally distinct entities, and the Plan does not argue\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthat the discretionary authority conferred on the Hospital should\n\nbe imputed to Partners.7      Cf.

ERISA provides that a named fiduciary may delegate\n\nto others its responsibilities under a plan -- other than trustee\n\nresponsibilities -- where the plan expressly sets forth procedures\n\nfor doing so.     29 U.S.C. ยง 1105(c)(1); Rodriguez-Abreu v.

To determine\n\nwhether a valid delegation of authority took place here, we must\n\naddress   the   majority's    \"double    issue\":    (1)    whether    the   Plan\n\nauthorized the Hospital to delegate its authority to Partners and,\n\nif so, (2) whether there is adequate evidence of the claimed\n\ndelegation of authority.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       To the extent the majority is suggesting that the Plan's\nargument for deferential review is strengthened by this alternative\ntheory -- i.e., that MGH and Partners are affiliated entities\nbetween whom delegation is unnecessary -- the suggestion is\ngratuitous given that the Plan did not offer the theory. Moreover,\nif the Plan, a sophisticated litigant, thought such a view of the\nentities' relationship was viable, it presumably would have made\nthe claim to avoid relying solely on an approach that even the\nmajority considers justified \"perhaps only by a modest margin.\"\n\n                                     -19-\n\fA.

See id.\n\n(\"Our   own       cases    treat   delegation      'authority'   and     delegation\n\n'procedures' as more or less the same thing . . . .\").                       However,\n\nthe statute's        reference      to   \"expressly    provid[ing]\" delegation\n\nprocedures means that such a grant of authority to delegate must be\n\nclearly stated.           This is consonant both with the requirement that\n\nthe   initial       grant    of    discretionary     authority   by     a    plan   be\n\nunambiguous, see Terry v.

The relevant\n\nlanguage of the plan stated that the fiduciary \"may '[d]elegate its\n\nauthority established' by the Plan, 'designate persons to assist in\n\ncarrying out fiduciary duties,' 'allocate responsibility for the\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\foperation and administration' of the Plan, and '[a]ppoint persons\n\nor committees to assist it to perform its duties' under the Plan.\"\n\nId. at 14-15.       We reached the same conclusion in Terry, where the\n\nplan       stated   that   \"'[t]he   Company   may   appoint   one   or   more\n\nindividuals to act on its behalf, in which case every reference\n\nherein made to the Company shall be deemed to mean or include the\n\nindividuals as to matters within their jurisdiction.'\" 145 F.3d at\n\n37-38.       In each of these cases, the plan language was unambiguous\n\nand unqualified in its grant of authority to delegate.\n\n               Here, in contrast, the Plan cannot be read to authorize\n\na delegation of plenary administrative authority over the Plan to\n\nPartners.       The most relevant provision of the Plan document, and\n\nthe one emphasized by the Plan,8 reads as follows:\n\n               6.3. Employment of Agents. The Hospital may\n               employ agents, including but not limited to, a\n               Claims Processor, accountants, attorneys or\n               actuaries to perform such services and duties\n               in connection with the administration of the\n               Plan as it may direct. . . . The Hospital\n               shall be fully protected in acting upon the\n\n\n\n       8\n       The Plan contains another potentially relevant provision,\nArticle 6.4, which provides authority for the Hospital to \"delegate\nto the Claims Processor responsibility for certifying the\ninformation and amount necessary for the proper payment of claims\nfrom the Fund under the provisions of the Plan.\" The Plan does not\ncontend, however, that the Hospital's authority to delegate its\ndiscretionary authority to Partners arises from this provision.\nThis is because the delegation authorized in Article 6.4 is a\nlimited one relating to claims processing duties, and, as discussed\nbelow, the authority that may be delegated to the Claims Processor\nunder the Plan falls short of the sort of administrative authority\nthat will trigger deferential review.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f              advice of any such agent, in whole or in\n              part . . . .\n\nUnlike the plan language in Terry and Wallace, the provision here\n\nauthorizes no complete devolution of the discretionary authority\n\ngranted to the Hospital under Article 6.1 of the Plan.                      Rather,\n\nArticle 6.3 allows the Hospital to \"employ\" agents, often referred\n\nto as service providers in ERISA parlance, whose activities it may\n\n\"direct,\" to assist with the day-to-day operation of the Plan and\n\nto   advise    the   Hospital   in   carrying      out   the   fiduciary     duties\n\nassigned to it in Article 6.1.                In Terry, in the course of\n\ndetermining whether a third-party claims processor could be sued as\n\na fiduciary under ERISA for its role in denying the claimant\n\nbenefits, we drew a sharp distinction between these types of \"third\n\nparty   service      provider[s],\"    on     the   one   hand,   and    the   plan\n\nadministrator and fiduciaries, on the other.               145 F.3d at 35-36.\n\n              The reference to a \"Claims Processor\" as one of the\n\nagents the Hospital may employ reflects the limited nature of the\n\ndelegation authorized by Article 6.3, and, critically, that it does\n\nnot include the ultimate authority to \"determine eligibility for\n\nbenefits or to construe the terms of the plan\" -- the authority\n\nthat triggers deferential review.            Firestone, 489 U.S. at 115.          A\n\nclaims processor generally makes the initial determination on a\n\nbenefits claim and may handle the first level of appeals, but\n\nanother   entity      is   usually    responsible        for   making   a     final\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fdetermination on appeal.9         In the typical instance, we have thus\n\nnoted that \"an entity which merely processes claims 'is not a\n\nfiduciary because such person does not have discretionary authority\n\nor discretionary control respecting management of the plan.'\"\n\nTerry, 145 F.3d at 35-36 (quoting 29 C.F.R. ยง 2509.75-8, D-2\n\n(1997)).         Such is plainly the case under the Plan.       Article 6.1\n\nsets       the   Hospital's   authority   side-by-side   with   the   Claims\n\nProcessor's.         It makes clear that, though \"[t]he processing of\n\nclaims and calculation of benefits shall be the sole responsibility\n\nof the Claims Processor,\" it is the Hospital that has \"full\n\ndiscretionary authority to administer the Plan, including without\n\nlimitation the authority to determine eligibility for benefits,\n\nconstrue the terms and conditions of the Plan, and resolve disputes\n\nas to the interpretation of the Plan documents.\"\n\n                 Accordingly, I read Article 6.3 to authorize delegation\n\nof administrative functions short of the Hospital's core authority\n\nto \"determine eligibility for benefits\" and \"construe the terms and\n\nconditions of the Plan.\"10        At a minimum, if this provision were\n\n\n       9\n       Here, for instance, Liberty (acting as claims processor)\nmade the initial benefits determination and processed Maher's first\nappeal, but, upon Maher's second and final appeal, Partners made\nthe ultimate determination to deny.\n       10\n        In relying on Pettaway v. Teachers Insurance and Annuity\nAss'n of America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"221056\"><a href=\"/opinion/221056/pettaway-v-teachers-ins-and-annuity-assn-of-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2011), for the\nproposition that decisional authority to determine benefits can be\ninferred from plan language, the majority fails to take seriously\nthe \"clear statement\" standard in our case law. Whether or not the\nlanguage in Pettaway would meet that standard, the language here\n\n                                     -23-\n\fintended to permit the delegation of the totality of the Hospital's\n\ndiscretionary authority, it lacks the requisite clarity.                  Cf.\n\nTerry, 145 F.3d at 37 (\"[T]he grant of discretionary authority must\n\nbe clear.\").    I thus conclude that Article 6.3 did not authorize\n\nthe Hospital's delegation of discretionary authority to Partners.\n\nHowever, as discussed below, even if the Plan permitted such\n\ndelegation,    the   evidence   that    a   delegation     took   place    is\n\ninadequate.\n\n\n\n\ndoes not.     The Pettaway      court    described   the    relevant      plan\nprovisions as follows:\n\n     As stated in the Plan Document, the \"Academy shall be the\n     Plan Administrator and the 'Named Fiduciary'\" with the\n     \"absolute power, authority and discretion to administer\n     the [Academy] Plan.\" Plan Document at 3.1, 3.2. \"All\n     interpretations of the Plan, and questions concerning its\n     administration and application, shall be determined\" by\n     the Academy, which has the authority to \"appoint such\n     accountants, counsel, specialists, and other persons as\n     it deems necessary or desirable in connection with the\n     administration of the Plan.\" [Plan Document] at 3.2.\n\nPettaway, 644 F.3d at 434. Thus, unlike the MGH Plan, delegation\nunder the plan in Pettaway was not limited to \"agents\" whom the\nadministrator would \"direct.\" See supra pp. 21-22. Instead, the\nPettaway   administrator   had   broad   authority    to   delegate\nadministrative responsibility to others whenever such a transfer of\nduties was \"deem[ed] necessary or desirable.\"\n\n     The limited language in the MGH Plan renders irrelevant the\nmajority's observation that lawyers, accountants and actuaries may\nbe assigned fiduciary duties. The issue here is not whether such\nprofessionals are considered fiduciaries, but whether this Plan\nclearly endorsed delegation of the authority to make final benefits\ndeterminations.\n\n                                  -24-\n\fB.   Did a Delegation Occur?\n\n           The   Plan   asserts    that    evidence   of   a    delegation    of\n\nauthority to Partners can be found in a 2005 document entitled\n\n\"Partners HealthCare System, Inc. Health and Welfare Plan Document\"\n\n(the \"Partners Plan Document\"), which the Plan characterizes as a\n\nSummary Plan Description (\"SPD\").           The document, published under\n\nPartners' name, purports to be \"a wrap-around plan document that\n\ncontains   the    definitions,      participation     and       administration\n\nprovisions of the various Partners health and welfare plans,\" which\n\nincludes the Plan at issue here as well as over forty others, \"and\n\nincorporates by reference the various Benefit Contracts associated\n\nwith the Plan to form a complete plan document.\"                 The language\n\nsupposedly effecting the delegation, located in Section II, Article\n\nIX of the Partners Plan Document, simply states, \"Partners acts as\n\nthe Plan Administrator for ERISA purposes of the Plans.\"                     The\n\nPartners   Plan    Document       further     provides      that,    as     Plan\n\nAdministrator,    Partners   \"has   the     discretion     to   determine    all\n\nmatters relating to eligibility, coverage and benefits under each\n\nPlan\" and \"has the full power to interpret each Plan and is\n\nresponsible for the operation of each Plan.\"\n\n           Our cases involving delegation of fiduciary authority\n\nunder ERISA do not directly address what sort of evidence will\n\nsuffice to show that delegation has been effected. To some extent,\n\nthe answer in an individual case may depend upon whether the ERISA\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fplan at issue sets forth particular procedures to canalize the\n\ndelegation process.       However, often, as here, the plan will not\n\nspecify a mechanism for delegation. In these cases, our precedents\n\nhint at some basic guidelines for determining whether the evidence\n\nbefore the court establishes the delegation of fiduciary authority.\n\n           First, it is not enough merely to show that the putative\n\ndelegate   is    carrying    out    discretionary        functions    of    plan\n\nadministration.       In Rodriguez-Abreu, a senior executive of the\n\ndefendant employer conducted a review of the denial of plaintiff's\n\nbenefits   and    corresponded     with     the   plaintiff     regarding   his\n\neligibility.     986 F.2d at 582, 584.            The defendant argued that\n\nthese circumstances alone were sufficient to show that the plan\n\nfiduciaries     had   delegated    their    discretion    to   the   executive,\n\ntriggering a deferential standard of review. We disagreed. Noting\n\nthat there was \"no expression of intent that [the executive] act as\n\nthe delegate of the Fiduciaries\" in the plan documents or elsewhere\n\nin   the record, we found no valid delegation of authority and thus\n\nemployed a de novo standard of review.            Id. at 584.\n\n           Second, evidence of the delegation may be provided by a\n\nwritten instrument other than the plan documents themselves.                 In\n\nTerry, the benefit plan at issue conferred discretionary authority\n\nto administer the plan to the Bayer Corporation, and Bayer in turn\n\ndelegated that authority to an internal \"Benefit Administration\n\nCommittee.\"      145 F.3d at 37-38.           The only evidence of this\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fdelegation        was     an      internal         organizational          document     (the\n\n\"Administrative           Procedures         for     the        Benefit    Administration\n\nCommittee\"),          which,    among    other       things,       explained     that     the\n\nCommittee       had    been    formed    to    \"'act       on    behalf    of   [Bayer]    by\n\nassisting [Bayer] in fulfilling its administrative duties which are\n\nset forth in the employee benefit plans.'\"                          Id. at 35, 38.        We\n\nfound this \"clear and direct delegation -- by written instrument --\n\nfrom the Plan Administrator to the Benefit Committee\" sufficient to\n\njustify a deferential standard of review.                          Id. at 38; see also\n\nWallace, 585 F.3d at 14-15 (holding extra-plan written instrument\n\ntransferring discretionary authority to administer plan to third\n\nparty sufficient evidence of valid delegation to trigger review\n\nunder the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard).\n\n                Here, we have a written document -- the Partners Plan\n\nDocument -- that purportedly gives to Partners the discretionary\n\nauthority to administer the Plan.                   However, the relevant terms in\n\nthe Partners Plan Document represent nothing more than the bare\n\nassertion       by    a   third      party    of    discretionary          authority    over\n\nadministration of the Plan.                   The document states simply that\n\n\"Partners acts as the Plan Administrator\" for all plans listed\n\namong     its    pages,11      and   that     Partners      \"has     the    discretion    to\n\n\n     11\n        As Maher points out, the Partners Plan Document never\naccurately refers to the Plan. In a table detailing the various\nsubsidiary plans to which it applies, the Partners Plan Document\nlists an \"MGH LTD Insurance Plan.\" The Plan is not, in fact, an\ninsurance plan, as it is funded through a trust, and thus the\n\n                                             -27-\n\fdetermine    all   matters    relating   to    eligibility,    coverage   and\n\nbenefits under each Plan\" and \"has the full power to interpret each\n\nPlan and is responsible for the operation of each Plan.\"             This is\n\nat best corroborative evidence of a transfer of authority from the\n\nHospital to Partners, but insufficient on its own to establish the\n\ndelegation.    The Plan has offered no evidence of an agreement\n\nbetween the Hospital and Partners, a corporate resolution by the\n\nHospital, or other such documentation that would indicate that the\n\nHospital affirmatively granted discretionary authority over the\n\nPlan to Partners.\n\n            In arguing over the effect of the Partners Plan Document,\n\nthe parties vigorously dispute whether it properly qualifies as an\n\nSPD for the Plan.12    This is a question that need not be resolved\n\nhere, as nothing turns on it.       Even if the Partners Plan Document\n\nqualified as an SPD, there would be a direct conflict with the\n\nprimary Plan document that must be resolved in the Plan document's\n\nfavor.      Each   document   purports    to    grant   full   discretionary\n\nauthority over the Plan, with the power to make \"final and binding\"\n\ndecisions, to a different entity.              Where there is a conflict\n\n\nreference to an \"LTD Insurance Plan\" is erroneous.\n     12\n       Maher argues at some length that the Partners Plan Document\nfails to include all categories of information required by statute\nto be present in an SPD.     See 29 U.S.C. ยง 1022(b).     The Plan\ncounters that the Partners Plan Document explicitly states that it\nis only one of several documents that \"collectively constitute the\nsummary plan description for each Plan,\" implying that those\nadditional documents supply the missing information.\n\n                                   -28-\n\fbetween the plan and the SPD, the plan language will generally\n\ncontrol, except in situations where the beneficiary relied to her\n\ndetriment on the SPD.

Thus,   to   the   extent     that    the   Partners   Plan   Document\n\nqualifies as an SPD, the grant of discretionary authority in the\n\nPlan document must still be credited over the conflicting grant in\n\nthe putative SPD.13\n\n           In sum, the Plan by its terms did not authorize the\n\nHospital to delegate its authority, and, even if the Plan had\n\npermitted such delegation, there is insufficient evidence that the\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       The majority fails to confront the inconsistency between the\ndocuments and, indeed, cites the Partners Plan Document as evidence\nthat the Hospital was authorized to delegate its discretionary\nauthority.    But a bare assertion of authority by the putative\ndelegee is even less meaningful as proof that delegation was\nauthorized than it is as evidence that a delegation in fact\noccurred.

Instead, an independent\n\nreview of    the    evidence   in   the    administrative       record    must   be\n\nperformed, Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 518; Richards, 592 F.3d at 239, and\n\nthe \"guiding principle\" is that the plaintiff bears the burden of\n\nproving he is disabled, Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 518-19.               To meet that\n\nburden, the terms of the Plan require Maher to prove a \"complete\n\nincapacity\" preventing her \"from performing any and every duty of\n\nany   occupation    or   employment,      for   which   [she]    is   reasonably\n\nqualified by education, training or experience.\"                  The Plan has\n\nnarrowed the scope of the inquiry somewhat by specifying the\n\noccupations for which it believes Maher to be qualified: telephonic\n\ntriage nurse, nurse case manager, and utilization review nurse.\n\n            Maher's arguments on the merits of the Plan's benefits\n\ndetermination fall into two categories.            First, Maher argues that\n\nher use of narcotics renders her incapable of filling any of the\n\nabove-mentioned jobs for which she is qualified by \"education,\n\ntraining, or experience.\"       In support of this argument she points\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fto state law that purportedly prohibits her from performing any\n\nnursing   duties    while   under    the    influence   of    narcotics.\n\nAlternatively, she submits that, legality aside, the effects of her\n\nmedications would impair her judgment and interfere with her\n\nability to perform nursing duties. Second, Maher contends that the\n\nevidence supports the disability caused by her chronic pain and\n\nnausea, and that Partners wrongly discounted evidence of the manner\n\nand extent to which pain affects her ability to function.\n\n          I address each of these arguments in turn.\n\nA. Disabling Effects of Narcotics Use\n\n          Maher's    medical   records     confirm   that,   for   nearly   a\n\ndecade, Maher has treated pain with a varying array of powerful\n\nnarcotics, and she usually has taken multiple drugs at the same\n\ntime and in significant doses.        In a 2007 letter, Dr. Elizabeth\n\nCuevas, Maher's primary care doctor, noted that her patient is\n\n\"treated with narcotics that are prescribed at very high doses,\"\n\nand Dr. Wolfram Goessling, Maher's treating gastroenterologist, has\n\nsimilarly noted that Maher \"takes impressive amounts of narcotics.\"\n\nOver the course of her treatment, Maher has consulted several pain\n\nclinics and periodically changed medications, but her records\n\nreveal no success in scaling back the use of narcotic painkillers.\n\nAccording to Dr. Herbert Malinoff, one of Liberty's consulting\n\ndoctors, Maher's record of treatment supports a diagnosis of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f\"chemical dependency relative to opioid and Benzodiazepine use over\n\na long period of time.\"\n\n            Maher contends that her drug use, as a matter of law,\n\nprevents her from working in any job within the field of nursing,\n\nand thus precludes employment in the one area for which she is\n\nqualified by education, training, or experience.               As Maher notes,\n\nMassachusetts' Standards of Conduct for licensed nurses prohibit\n\nnurses from practicing \"while impaired.\"             244 Mass. Code Regs.\n\nยง 9.03(36).      Maher argues that the sedentary nursing roles that\n\nLiberty   has    suggested   she    would   be    capable      of   filling   all\n\nnecessarily involve the \"practice\" of nursing, defined by statute\n\nto include \"coordination and management of resources for care\n\ndelivery.\"      Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 112, ยง 80B.            Because she is\n\n\"therapeutically addicted to narcotic medication,\" Maher suggests\n\nthat she is legally \"impaired\" and cannot serve in the above\n\npositions.14\n\n            Though Maher tries to segregate this line of reasoning\n\nfrom her alternative argument that the effects of her medications\n\nwould interfere with her ability to carry out the duties of a\n\nnursing job, they cannot be so easily disentangled.                 The fact of\n\nnarcotics    use does   not,   by   itself,      appear   to    preclude   legal\n\n\n\n     14\n        Because I dispose of Maher's argument based on the\ndefinition of \"impaired,\" I do not address her contention that the\nsedentary nursing roles identified by Liberty involve the\n\"practice\" of nursing under Massachusetts law.\n\n                                    -32-\n\ffunction as a nurse.     The governing regulations define \"impaired\"\n\nto   mean   \"the   inability   to   practice     nursing   with   reasonable\n\njudgment, skill, and safety by reason of alcohol or drug abuse, use\n\nof substances, a physical or mental illness or condition, or by any\n\ncombination of the foregoing.\"      244 Mass. Code Regs. ยง 9.02.       Thus,\n\nwhether Maher is \"impaired\" turns not on whether she is addicted to\n\nnarcotics, but on a factual determination of whether her narcotic\n\nuse is likely to interfere with her \"judgment [and] skill.\"             Id.\n\n            The evidence of the effect of Maher's narcotic use on her\n\nability to concentrate and function is mixed.              There is, to be\n\nsure, an intuitive logic to the notion that we should be wary of\n\nentrusting patient care to a medical professional who takes large\n\namounts of narcotic medications.            This is a point that Maher\n\nemphasizes in her briefs, and it has some basis in fact.             Medical\n\nauthorities    warn   that   narcotics     may   cause   sedation,   \"mental\n\nclouding,\" and impaired psychomotor function.            However, according\n\nto a publication of the American Medical Association included in\n\nthe administrative record, these types of side effects \"usually\n\ndissipate with continued treatment, normally within a week with\n\nregularly scheduled dosing, and studies have demonstrated that most\n\npatients on chronic opioid therapy can safely drive cars.\"            One of\n\nLiberty's consulting physicians, Dr. Robert Millstein, makes the\n\nsame point in his February 2007 report, though he acknowledges\n\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f\"very   few    studies   have   examined    the      effects   of   opioids   on\n\nselective, divided, and sustained attention.\"\n\n              Maher's medical records indicate that she has often\n\ncomplained of the sedation brought on by her regimen of narcotics.\n\nHowever, close scrutiny of these records indicates that many of her\n\nreports of somnolence and other drug-related side effects are\n\ncorrelated with a change in medication or an adjustment of dosage.\n\nTo take one example, Maher saw Dr. Goessling in March 2005 and\n\ncomplained that the morphine she was taking made her \"loopy and\n\nmore sleepy than usual.\"        Her medical records reveal that she was\n\nstarted on morphine only a couple of days prior, when she was\n\nadmitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and the pain clinicians\n\nrecommended that she transition from OxyContin.\n\n              Overall, I do not find convincing support in the record\n\nfor the proposition that Maher's drug use, by itself, would render\n\nher incapable of working in one of the sedentary nursing positions\n\nidentified      by   Liberty.     There    is   no    clear    prohibition    in\n\nMassachusetts on serving as a nurse while on a medically prescribed\n\nregimen of narcotics, so long as the drugs do not impair the\n\nnurse's \"judgment, skill, and safety.\"            Maher's doctors have not\n\nsuggested that her use of drugs would interfere with her judgment\n\nor ability to make rational decisions.            Indeed, Dr. Goessling and\n\nDr. Cuevas both identify excessive sedation to be the major side\n\neffect associated with Maher's medication.            I acknowledge that Dr.\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\fGoessling has opined that he \"cannot imagine that it would be in\n\n[Maher's] or society's benefit to have her work as a nurse making\n\ndecisions over other people's lives,\" but he does not point to any\n\nspecific effect of the drugs that would render Maher incapable of\n\nsafely managing the limited nursing roles suggested for her by\n\nLiberty.\n\n                I am not unconcerned by the possibility that narcotic-\n\nrelated sedation would make it difficult for Maher to complete a\n\nregular workday.         In one instance in 2005, Maher reported that the\n\nsomnolence associated with a change from OxyContin to Palladone was\n\ncausing her to take three naps per day. Such considerable sedation\n\nwould clearly interfere with most if not all possible employment.\n\nHowever, because Maher's reports of drowsiness and other adverse\n\neffects from medication appear largely related to alterations in\n\nher drug regimen -- which conforms to the medical evidence that\n\nside effects are most pronounced when first starting a narcotic --\n\nI    do   not     see    convincing     evidence   that     Maher's    ability   to\n\nconcentrate        and       exercise   judgment    would     be    significantly\n\ncompromised        by    a    regular    and    stable    program     of   narcotic\n\nmedications.\n\nB.    Disabling Effects of Pain and Other Symptoms\n\n                I reach a different conclusion with respect to the impact\n\nof the symptoms of Maher's maladies -- chronic pain, nausea,\n\nvomiting, and food intolerance -- on her ability to work.                    After\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fcareful review of the record, I find persuasive evidence that\n\nMaher's symptoms would prevent her from performing the duties of\n\nthe jobs identified by Liberty.\n\n             Before evaluating the record on this issue, I note that\n\nmy concern here lies with the evidence of limitations attributable\n\nto Maher's symptoms, and not with whether the evidence supports\n\nMaher's underlying medical conditions.             There is considerable\n\nuncertainty regarding the etiology of Maher's abdominal pain and\n\nother complaints, and attempting to resolve a question that has\n\nstymied multiple doctors for the past decade is both unnecessary\n\nand beyond my expertise.15     The diagnosis makes little difference\n\nhere.     Our court has emphasized before that in dealing with hard-\n\nto-diagnose, pain-related conditions, it is not reasonable to\n\nexpect or require objective evidence supporting the beneficiary's\n\nclaimed diagnosis.

The Plan's doctors disagree, but concede\nthat the record supports a diagnosis of either \"chronic pain\nsyndrome with abdominal focus,\" per Dr. Malinoff, or fibromyalgia,\nper Dr. Millstein.\n\n                                  -36-\n\f               1.     Evidence Relied upon by the Plan\n\n               I begin by assessing the evidence that, in the view of\n\nthe Plan, calls Maher's limitations into question, the foremost of\n\nwhich     is    the    alleged   inconsistency   between   Maher's   reported\n\ncapabilities and the level of activity confirmed by surveillance.\n\nLiberty conducted surveillance of Maher on nineteen days between\n\nOctober 2002 and October 2006, portions of which were recorded on\n\nvideo.16 The Plan and its doctors highlighted a handful of examples\n\nof increased activity by Maher captured in the surveillance.               On\n\none occasion, Maher was observed walking to the front of her\n\nproperty \"carrying what appeared to be a flower / plant and a large\n\nbucket,\" and, four minutes later, walking back with the same\n\nbucket.        On another, she drove herself a short distance (a four-\n\nminute drive) to a local school, where she went inside and returned\n\ncarrying her son (then close to three years old), whom she placed\n\ninside the car before departing for her home.            On a third occasion\n\n-- and the one on which the Plan places the most emphasis --\n\nMaher's husband drove Maher and her son to a local soccer field on\n\na Saturday morning. There, Maher \"was periodically observed as she\n\nand her husband flew a kite with the young boy,\" as she \"walked and\n\njogged around the soccer field,\" and as she \"at one point lifted\n\n\n\n\n     16\n       This included six days of surveillance in 2002, three days\nin 2005, and ten days in 2006.\n\n                                       -37-\n\fthe small boy and swung him around in her arms.\"   The outing lasted\n\nthirty-four minutes.\n\n           This surveillance evidence does not have the significance\n\nthat the Plan ascribes to it.   In the activity questionnaires she\n\nsubmitted to Liberty, Maher consistently reported that the level of\n\nactivity she can sustain is entirely dependent on her pain, nausea,\n\nand level of medication. For example, in her latest questionnaire,\n\ndated September 2006, Maher indicated that the amount of time she\n\ncan tolerate sitting, standing, and riding in or driving a car\n\ndepends on the presence of pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nShe also noted that she leaves the house during the week two to\n\nthree times a day (one to two times on weekend days), and that she\n\nhelps take care of her children and perform small chores when she\n\nis able.\n\n           As the majority points out, Liberty's surveillance is not\n\ninconsistent with Maher's own account of her activities.       Over\n\nnineteen days of surveillance, there were a number of days in which\n\nMaher was confirmed to be at home and never left the residence.   On\n\nother days, she left the house -- either as a passenger or driving\n\nherself -- to run a limited number of errands, mostly picking up or\n\ndropping off her children at school, and once to go to dinner at a\n\nrestaurant.   She was also observed outside on two brief occasions\n\ninvolved in what could generously be described as yard chores:\n\ncarrying a flower pot and, on another occasion, sitting in the bed\n\n\n                                -38-\n\fof her husband's truck holding a broom or rake while her husband\n\nappeared to be cleaning up.         All of this activity is consistent\n\nwith her description of a low level of activity dependent on the\n\nebb and flow of her symptoms.       It would be unusual for a mother of\n\nthree children to be able to avoid all activity.\n\n             With regard to the kite-flying episode, which strays the\n\nfarthest from Maher's reported limitations, Maher has indicated\n\nthat the outing was a \"special event\" for which she premedicated\n\nwith morphine.       In other circumstances, this explanation might\n\nstrain     credulity.       Here,   however,     the   notion   that     Maher\n\npremedicates to prepare for activities that may trigger pain finds\n\nsupport in records that predate the incident.17            In a March 2003\n\nactivity questionnaire, for example, Maher noted that she travels\n\nby   plane   only   with   \"pre-medication     for   pain and   nausea    from\n\nincreased cabin pressure on abdomen.\"                In her September 2006\n\nquestionnaire, Maher also noted that her ability to carry out\n\nvarious activities of daily life \"always depend[s] on how much pain\n\nmedicine I use . . . to help myself.\"          Moreover, the entire outing\n\n\n\n      17\n        The district court concluded that, assuming that Maher's\nouting with her family can be explained by premedication, \"it is a\nreasonable inference that she could also pre-medicate to perform a\nsedentary job.\" I cannot agree. Maher takes a large amount of\nnarcotics daily to address her background pain. The fact that she\ncan, on top of this background dosage, take additional pain\nmedications to ward off pain during the occasional short episodes\nof increased activity does not suggest that it would be feasible\nfor her to regularly take extra medication to make it through an\neight-hour workday.\n\n                                    -39-\n\fat the athletic fields was very brief, lasting just over half an\n\nhour.   It would be unfair to read too much into one short episode\n\nof increased activity, given the consistency of the larger record\n\nof surveillance with Maher's reported capabilities.\n\n           Turning   to    an     evaluation    of    the    medical   opinions\n\nconcerning Maher's limitations, my conclusion again diverges from\n\nthat of the Plan and its doctors.          Among Maher's treating doctors,\n\nthere is thin support for her capacity to return to a sedentary\n\njob.    The most direct evidence is found in a questionnaire,\n\ncompleted by Dr. Gale Haydock, indicating that Maher is \"OK to\n\nperform sedentary duties.\" However, Dr. Haydock treated Maher only\n\nonce, in the winter of 2006, when Maher was admitted to the\n\nhospital for several days to treat a flare-up of abdominal pain,\n\nand thus Dr. Haydock had no opportunity to observe the course of\n\nMaher's symptoms over time.\n\n           One could also, as the Plan has, read various statements\n\nby Maher's primary care physician (Dr. Cuevas) to support Maher's\n\nability to perform sedentary work. Most notably, in a conversation\n\nwith Dr.     Malinoff,   Dr.    Cuevas   stated      her   agreement   with Dr.\n\nMalinoff's    opinion     that,    \"from    a   purely      internal   medicine\n\nperspective, there is no identifiable physical exam or anatomic /\n\nlaboratory abnormality that would prevent [Maher] from working at\n\na very minimum at a sedentary level.\"                 This awkwardly precise\n\nstatement is technically true and is, undoubtedly, an accurate\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\freflection       of    Dr.     Cuevas's     medical    opinion.18           It   is    also\n\ntransparently misleading.              Maher's medical records make clear that\n\nno    doctor    has     been    able   to   identify    a     physical      or   anatomic\n\nabnormality that causes her symptoms.                  However, the absence of a\n\ndiagnosed medical condition says nothing about the reliability of\n\nMaher's complaints or whether her reported symptoms prevent her\n\nfrom    working.         On    those     questions,    Dr.    Cuevas's       opinion     is\n\nunequivocal.          In a letter dated March 2007, Dr. Cuevas wrote that\n\nMaher \"remains in significant disability, both from her chronic\n\npain and from the side effects the pain medication cause,\" and that\n\nshe \"is unable to reliably perform duties because her pain can\n\nbecome so severe so quickly.\"\n\n               Lastly, the record also contains opinions from the three\n\ndoctors retained by the Plan -- Dr. Millstein, Dr. Malinoff, and\n\nDr.    Dean    Hashimoto,        Chief    of   Occupational         and    Environmental\n\nMedicine at MGH -- concluding that the available evidence does not\n\nsupport Maher's claimed inability to work a sedentary job.                            I find\n\nthe opinions rendered by these doctors unpersuasive.                         Each doctor\n\nrelied to a significant degree on the surveillance records in\n\nevaluating      Maher's        capabilities,       focusing    on    the    episodes     of\n\nactivity detailed above and finding them inconsistent with Maher's\n\n\n\n       18\n       Following their conversation, Dr. Malinoff mailed a letter\nto Dr. Cuevas that recapitulated the substance of their\nconversation and asked that she sign to verify its accuracy. She\ndid so and returned the letter to Dr. Malinoff.\n\n                                            -41-\n\fclaims.      Dr. Malinoff and Dr. Hashimoto also interpreted Dr.\n\nCuevas's statements as supportive of Maher's ability to return to\n\nwork.     For the reasons stated, I have reached contrary conclusions\n\nbased on the same evidence.         Additionally, Dr. Hashimoto observed\n\nthat, even accepting the veracity of Maher's reported symptoms,\n\nthere has been no attempt to evaluate \"through neuropsych testing,\n\nscans, or other available means\" the extent to which Maher's pain\n\nand use of narcotics affect her cognition and ability to function.\n\nThis failing can be attributed, to some degree, to the Plan's\n\ndecision not to pursue an independent medical evaluation of Maher\n\nto assist in the assessment of her claim.19                Nevertheless, as I\n\ndiscuss below, I find the record evidence of Maher's limitations\n\nsufficient    even   absent   the   sort    of   testing    suggested   by   Dr.\n\nHashimoto.\n\n\n\n\n     19\n       Indeed, I find the Plan's failure to conduct an independent\nmedical examination somewhat troubling. There is no requirement\nthat a plan administrator arrange for a medical examination prior\nto terminating benefits, see Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 526, but here the\ncircumstances certainly should have suggested its utility.       As\nearly as 2004, Dr. Millstein counseled that \"[i]f it is felt to be\nimportant to ascertain whether impairment due to abdominal pain\nexists, I would suggest consideration of functional assessment by\nsome alternative means.\" After her benefits had been denied, Maher\neven offered to make herself available for a physical examination\nby a doctor of the Plan's choice. The record reflects that the\nPlan's administrators internally discussed the possibility of an\nindependent medical examination in September 2007, but declined to\npursue one due, in part, to concern for slowing down the process.\n\n                                     -42-\n\f          2.   The Evidence Supports Maher's Limitations\n\n          Viewing the totality of the medical evidence in the\n\nadministrative record, I am persuaded that Maher's symptoms prevent\n\nher from reliably performing the duties of a sedentary nursing job.\n\nAt the fore of that evidence are the opinions of Maher's treating\n\ndoctors, Dr. Cuevas and Dr. Goessling.     As noted, Dr. Cuevas's\n\nassessment as of March 2007 was that Maher \"remains in significant\n\ndisability\" and \"is unable to reliably perform duties because her\n\npain can become so severe so quickly.\"   Similarly, Dr. Goessling,\n\nwho has followed Maher since the onset of her abdominal symptoms in\n\nlate 2001, opined in a 2007 letter:\n\n          In her current status, Mrs. Maher is barely\n          able to provide for herself and her 3-year-old\n          son during the day. She is not able to stand\n          or walk for prolonged periods of time. She is\n          suffering from constant nausea that is only\n          partially relieved by her . . . medication.\n          She   has   intermittent   diarrhea   due   to\n          malabsorption from lack of pancreatic enzymes\n          followed by constipation caused by her high\n          doses of narcotics medication. On top of her\n          chronic abdominal pain, she has frequent\n          exacerbations,    [and]   often    this   pain\n          prohibit[s] her completely from taking any\n          solid foods. . . . [ยถ] . . . [L]et me assure\n          that I do not see any way that my patient\n          would be able to sit or stand for prolonged\n          period[s] of time let alone do physically or\n          intellectually demanding work.\n\nWhile there is some evidence that Dr. Goessling did not actively\n\ntreat Maher in 2006 and 2007, he saw her repeatedly in the\n\n\n\n\n                               -43-\n\fpreceding years and she appears to have consulted with him prior to\n\nhis writing the letter quoted above.20\n\n           These    opinions   echo   Maher's    own    assessment    of    her\n\nlimitations.    In an affidavit, Maher stated that she \"cannot be\n\ncounted   on   to   do   anything,\"   because     her   symptoms     come   on\n\nunpredictably and leave her in \"excruciating pain\" that \"is so bad\n\nthat it sucks the wind out of [her].\"           Though pain is subjective\n\nand thus difficult to reliably document, her characterization\n\nappears to be borne out by the record.           From late 2001, she has\n\nconsistently complained of intermittent and severe abdominal pain.\n\nHer complaints have been credible enough to convince the numerous\n\ndoctors who have seen her that she needs serious narcotics to\n\nrelieve her pain and allow her to function.        While we might suspect\n\ndrug-seeking tendencies in such circumstances, the record does not\n\nreveal such tendencies. An early note from Dr. Goessling indicates\n\nthat Maher was \"quite reluctant to take pain medications,\" and\n\nthere are multiple indications in later records of her desire to\n\nmove off of the painkillers.21        Even with her regular regimen of\n\n\n     20\n       The letter, addressed to Maher's case manager at Liberty,\nbegins, \"I would like to update you on [Maher's] overall condition,\nespecially in light of the recent denial letter for her benefits\nthat she received,\" implicitly suggesting that Dr. Goessling had\ncurrent knowledge of Maher's condition at the time of writing.\n     21\n       Still, the record is mixed as to the sincerity of Maher's\ndesire to discontinue narcotic use, as she has twice started\ntreatment with a pain clinic and then failed to follow up. She\nascribes her reluctance to continue treatment at the clinics to\ninterpersonal conflict with the doctors at one clinic, and a\n\n                                  -44-\n\fheavy narcotics, Maher's abdominal pain has repeatedly brought her\n\nto the emergency room, where she was admitted on at least two\n\noccasions for multiple-day stays to manage her pain.\n\n          Maher's record of treatment thus bespeaks significant and\n\ndebilitating pain.   Given the number of medical professionals who\n\nhave examined her and found her distress genuine, I have no reason\n\nto question the reality of this pain.      As the Seventh Circuit noted\n\nin Carradine v. Barnhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785356\"><a href=\"/opinion/785356/patty-carradine-v-jo-anne-b-barnhart-commissioner-of-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2004):\n\n          What is significant is the improbability that\n          [the claimant] would have undergone the\n          pain-treatment procedures that she did, which\n          included . . . heavy doses of strong drugs\n          . . ., merely in order to strengthen the\n          credibility of her complaints of pain and so\n          increase her chances of obtaining disability\n          benefits; likewise the improbability that she\n          is a good enough actress to fool a host of\n          doctors and emergency-room personnel into\n          thinking she suffers extreme pain; and the\n          (perhaps lesser) improbability that this host\n          of medical workers would prescribe drugs and\n          other treatment for her if they thought she\n          were faking her symptoms. Such an inference\n          would amount to an accusation that the medical\n          workers who treated [the claimant] were\n          behaving unprofessionally.\n\nId. at 755 (internal citation omitted). I therefore credit Maher's\n\nreports   of   abdominal   pain,     and   note   as   well   that   her\n\ngastrointestinal and food intolerance symptoms -- which are more\n\nreadily verified -- find support in numerous records.\n\n\n\nfeeling that the type of program offered by the other clinic was\nnot appropriate for her. Her lack of follow-through in this regard\ndoes not diminish the overall force of the evidence of her pain.\n\n                                   -45-\n\f           I similarly find the evidence sufficient to corroborate\n\nMaher's claims that these symptoms would interfere with her ability\n\nto work.   Maher's recurring acute attacks of abdominal pain would,\n\nat a minimum, result in frequent absences from work, which would be\n\nprohibitively    disruptive    of    any    attempt   to   maintain   regular\n\nemployment.     Surveillance also suggests that her background level\n\nof   symptoms   is    sufficient    to   keep   her   housebound    with   some\n\nfrequency, or to permit only limited levels of activity.               Though\n\nMaher may occasionally run errands, contribute to household chores,\n\nor even recreate with her family for short periods of time, there\n\nis a sharp \"difference between a person's being able to engage in\n\nsporadic physical activities and her being able to work eight hours\n\na day five consecutive days of the week.\"               Id.     On balance, I\n\nconclude that the evidence demonstrates that Maher cannot reliably\n\nperform the duties of a full-time sedentary nursing job.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Based on a close, de novo review of the administrative\n\nrecord, I am persuaded that Maher's abdominal pain and related\n\nsymptoms effectively prevent her \"from performing any and every\n\nduty of any occupation or employment, for which [she] is reasonably\n\nqualified by education, training or experience.\"              Hence, I believe\n\nwe must go beyond vacating the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Plan and remand for entry of judgment in\n\nMaher's favor.       I therefore dissent.\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\f</pre>",
