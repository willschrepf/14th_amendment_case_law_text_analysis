Attached to the motion is a copy of the order of the United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, in Civil Action No. 1311, dated June 12, 1963, holding unlawful and unconstitutional the racial segregation policy and practice of petitioners, and directing the desegregation of the public schools of the Georgetown Independent School District pursuant to the plan and schedule set forth in the order. Petitioners are subject to this order and to such further orders as may be entered by the United States District Court or by any Federal courts of appellate jurisdiction in event an appeal of the case is prosecuted.</p>\n<p>Also attached to the motion of petitioners is a copy of the resolution of petitioners adopted June 25, 1963, reading, in part, that \"in connection with the building program heretofore adopted, that all school buildings and facilities in the Georgetown Independent School District, including the Westside School, will not be segregated schools but will be desegregated in accordance with the order of the aforesaid United States District Court, and that all such schools will be occupied and used in accordance with such rulings.\"</p>\n<p>Respondents oppose the motion of petitioners but do not challenge the correctness of the order and resolution attached to the motion of petitioners and referred to above.</p>\n<p>Since petitioners are now subject to orders of the Federal courts requiring desegregation of the schools operated by the Georgetown Independent School District, and may not expend the funds of the District for a purpose contrary to such orders, we declare this case moot.
