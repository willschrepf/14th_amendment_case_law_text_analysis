Mr. Stilwell now claims\n           that he is no longer asking that the Dunbar\n           School be on the accredited list, since this\n           would force the Board of Trustees to pay the\n           Negro teachers on the same salary schedule as\n           the white teachers.\n                \"H. B. 300, an Act of the 50th Legisla-\n           ture, Regular Session, as interpreted by the\n           State Superintendent, means that an accred-\n           ited school system such as Texarkana must\n           operate both, an accredited Negro school and\n           an accredited white school, or must be seeking\n           accreditation for their Negro school and pay\n          ,their teachers the same salary schedule.\n\f                                                              . -\n\n\nHon. L. A. Woods - Page 2   (V-388)\n\n\n          YKr. Stilwell would like to know\n     first if the State Superintendent is act-\n     ing within his rights in determining that\n     an accredited school system such as Texar-\n     kana must be seeking accreditation for\n     their unaccredited Negro School; and second,\n     in order to avoid the penalty clause for\n     failing to pay all Negro teachers the same\n     salary as the white teachers he would like\n     to know whether the provision of Sec. 3 of\n     H. B. 300, which directs the State Super-\n     intendent to remove a school from the ac-\n     credited list of schools, is constitutional?n\n          Section 1 of H. B. 300, 50th Legislature, in\nmandatory language requires that the board of trustees\nof each and every Texas school district maintaining an\naccredited or affiliated elementary or high school, or\nseeking accreditation or affiliation, shall pay their\nteachers upon a salary schedule, which salary schedule\nshall provide a minimum beginnin salary for a full\ntime teacher of not less than (17 $2000.00 per year and\n(2) with increments above the minimum for (a) addition-\nal college training and (b) for experience and effi-\nciency in teaching. Such increments shall be paid upon\nthe schedule provided by the State aid law (H. El.295,\n50th Leg.). Section 1 requires further that beginning\nteachers in such school districts who do not have pre-\nvious teaching experience but who hold a bachelor's\ndegree or better shall be paid a minimum beginning sal-\nary of not less than $2,000,.00,and that teachers who do\nnot have such a degree shall be paid upon the salary\nschedule provided in the State Aid Law.\n          Section 1 applies to all school districts main-\ntaining such an accredited or affiliated school, or seek-\ning accreditation or affiliation, whether the district be\nself-operating or receiving State aid. There is no impli-\ncation in H. B. 300 that a school district must be subject\nto or eligible under the provisions of the State Aid Law\nbefore H. B. 300 will apply thereto. Rather than incor-\nporate in full the salary schedule and the increment sched-\nule provisions of the State Aid Law into H. B. 300, the\nLegislature has seen fit to incorporate same by werence\nfor the purposes therein set out, which it may legally do.\nFurthermore, it is clear the Legislature has specifically\nmade the provisions of H. B. 300 apply impartially to all\nthe teachers of such school districts regardless of race.\n\f               ,-\n\n\n\nHon. L. A. Woods - Page 3\n\n\nIt should be observed also that H. B. 300 is a minimum\nsalary law. It does not attempt to fix the maximum\nsalary whioh a district may pay its teachers. School\ndistricts may provide larger salaries above the mini-\nmum requirement of this bill for those of its teachers\nwho deserve monetary recognition for their efficiency\nin teaching. The increment schedule of the State Aid\nLaw, H. B. 295, Article III, Section 2, provides in-\ncrements only for additional college training and in-\ncrements for teaching experience. There are no fixed\nincrements providing for teaching efficiency except to\nthe extent that teaching efficiency may be regarded as\nthe natural result of teaching experience, but a dis-\ntrict which meets the minimum requirements may adopt a\nschedule for higher salaries based on efficiency and\nother valid considerations.\n          Section 2 of H. B. 300 is a recognition on\nthe part of the Legislature that some school districts\nmaintaining an accredited or affiliated school or seek-\ning accreditation or affiliation may not be able to\nmeet the minimum salary requirements set out in Section\n1 because of the insufficiency of school revenues. Sec-\ntion 2 provides in substance that if the total revenue\nof any school district will not permit the payment of\nthe salary requirement and increment schedule referred\nto in Section 1, when the total amount received from\nthe State per capita plus all additional State or Fed-\neral aid (except grants for school lunches) plus 4% of\ntotal current local maintenance tax are devoted to the\npayment of salaries of teachers, principals and super-\nvisors, then the highest salaries possible with revenue\navailable shall be paid by such district to its teachers.\nThis means that all such school districts not having\nsufficient revenues to comply fully with the provisions\nof Section 1 of H. B. 300, shall comply as nearly and\ncompletely as possible with Oection 1 and to the extent\nthat the revenues itemized in Section 2 will permit.\nFor example, if the total revenue of a district ear-\nmarked by Section 2 to be considered in the payment of\nits teachers’ salaries is but 90$ of the total amount\nneeded to oomply fully with Section 1 of said bill, then\nsuch a district shall pay teachers’ salaries on a 90$\nsalary sohedule, the highest salaries possible with the\nrevenue available. The fact that any such school dis-\ntriot cannot comply fully with the minimum salary re-\nquirements of Section 1 of said bill and thus comes with-\nin the provisions of Section 2, does not relieve it from\nthe other statutory requirements and obligations of,Seo-\ntion 1. In the instant example, all the teachers’ sala-\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 4   (V-388)\n\n\nries of such a 9C$ district should be at least 90% of\nwhat said minimum salaries would be if the district\ncould financially~conform to Section 1 of H. B. 300.\n            We are requested to pass upon the constitu-\ntionality of Section 3 of H. B. 300. Section 3 imposes\na statutory   duty on a body designated as the Committee\nof Affiliation and Accreditation. It is the duty of\nsaid Committee to require evidence from the State Super-\nintendent acting through his Deputy State Superintendents,\nshowing (1) that the provisions of H. B. 300, Section 1,\nare being fully complied with, or (2) that the salary\nschedule actually being paid is approved by both the\nState Superintendent and the State Board of Education,\nbefore any school of any such district is affiliated or\naccredited or continued on the list of affiliated or\naccredited schools. Under Section 2, such school dis-\ntricts are required to submit their salary schedules for\nthe payment of their teachers to the State Superintendent\nand through him to the State Board of Education for ap-\nproval.\n          The State Superintendent of Public Instruction\nis a statutory officer (Article 2655) and his general\nduties are outlined in Articles 2656 and 2657, V. C. S.\nHe is charged with the administration of the school laws\nand is given the superintendency of matters relating to\nthe public schools of this State. Article 2657, V .C.S.,\nprovides:\n          “The State Superintendent shall advise\n    and counsel with the school officers of the\n    counties,  cities and towns and school dis-\n    tricts as to the best methods of conducting\n    the public schools, and shall be empowered-to\n    issue instructions and’regulations binding for\n    obs,ervanceon all officers and teachers in.all ““”\n    cases wherein the orovisions of the school law ““‘“Y\n    may require interpretation in order to carry “-“’ ’\n    out the designs expressed therein, also in\n    cases that may arise in which the law hapsno\n    provision, and where necessity requires some\n    rule in order that there may be no hardships\n    to individuals, and no delays or inconvenience\n    in the management of school affairs.” (Empha-\n    sis ours)\n          Under Article 2678a, 2679 and 2681, V.C.S., the\nDepartment of Education has been authorized to classify\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 5   (V-388)\n\n\nand/or to prescribe rules and regulations for the\nclassification or ranking of every elementary school\nand high school of Texas. The legal basis for this\nclassification, zanking, or accreditation of Texas\nschools by the Department of Education acting through\nits head, the State Superintendent, finds its origin\nin Sections 3 and 5 of Chapter 36, Acts 1915, 34th\nLegislature, R. S., the provisions of which may be\ntraced and found in the above enumerated statutes.\nArticles 2888 and 2889, V.C.S., further authorize the\nState Superintendent to classify, rank or credit the\ninstitutions of higher learning in this State. Nixon\nClay Commercial College v. Woods, 176 S.W. (2d) 1015.\n          Since September 1916, the work of classifl-\ncation, accreditation and affillation of the schools\nof this State has been carried on by a committee under\nthe chairmanship of the State Superintendent of Public\nInstruction, which is described and consists of school\nrepresentatives named in the general manner set out in\nthe Regulations, Standards and Aotivities Bulletin No.\n469, published by the Department of Eclucation,pages 1\nto 6 inclusive. This committee is the body adopted\nand referred to by the Legislature in its H. B. 300 as\nthe Committee on Affiliation and Accreditation. For\n31 years.now this committee has been recommending and\nrevising the rules which should govern in the matter\nof classification and accreditation of public schools\nand the State Superintendent has exercised his statu-\ntory discretion found in Article 2657 in adopting same\nand prescribing such adopted recommendations as rules\nand regulations of the Department of Education on\nclassification and accreditation matters 0\n          The rules and regulations of the Department of\nEducation on the aocreditation and affiliation of the\npublic schools of Texas, when not in conflict with the\nlaws of this State, have the same force and binding ef-\nfect of a statute. Bear v. Donna Independent School Dis-\ntrict, 85 S.W. (2d) 797; 56 C. J.~,pages 333 and 489.\nHad this committee method of practice used by the6q+ part-\nment of Education in the formulation of its presen rules\nand regulations or, indeed, the rules and regulations\nthemselves, been contrary to the views of the Legisla-\nture, it is reasonable to presume that statutes governing\nthe State Superintendent in these matters would have been\namended long ago to meet such contrary views. Slocomb,\net al, v. Independent School District, 116 Tex. 289, at\n298.\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 6\n\n\n          Under Article VII, Section 1, Constitution of\nTexas, it is the duty of the Legislature to establish\nand make suitable provision for the support and maln-\ntenance of an efficient system of public free schools.\nSince it was necessary to establish and maintain a De-\npartment of Education to effectuate this provision, the\nLegislature has the undoubted power to delegate to said\nDepartment such power and authority as may be necessary\nto accomplish the end intended. The Legislature could\nnot possibly foresee all of the problems that would a-\nrise in the administration of the schools. Necessarily,\nthe Department’.ofEducation is given a wide discretion\nin such matters. It may make all such rules and regula-\ntions as in its judgment are necessary to maintain an\nefficient system of schools, subject to the provisions\nthat such regulations be not arbitrary, unreasonable or\nin violation of law. Mosely V. City of Dallas, 17 S.Wv.\n(2d) 36; R.C.L., Vol. 24, p. 575; Wilson v. Abilene In-\ndependent School District, 190 S.W. (2d) 406.\n          Until the passage of H. B. 300 by the 50th\nLegislature, matters concerning the classification and\naccreditation of schools have been left entirely within\nthe discretion of the State Superintendent, who has exer-\ncised such discretionary authority by prescribing the\npresent rules and regulations found in the submitted\nbulletin upon the recommendations of the’Committee on\nAffiliation and Accreditation. Bulletin, pages 16, 17,\n46, 47, 40 and 49. Section 3 of A. B. 300 imposes the\nfirst and only statutory duty on the said committee\nwhich has come to our attention. Said committee may not\nnow, by reason of Section 3, recommend the accreditation\nor affiliation of any school of any district which does\nnot conform to the minimum salary provisions of Section\n1 and/or Section 2 of H. B. 300, nor may it recommend\nthe continuance of any school of any district on the ac-\ncredited or affiliated list where any school of any dis-\ntrict fails or refuses to meet the provisions thereof.\n           The authority to classify or accredit schools\ndoes not rest, as seems to be contended in this opinion\nrequest, in the board of trustees of a local school dis-\ntrict. Such authority lies in the State Superintendent\nwho has been empowered under statutes hereinabove enum-\nerated to promulgate rules and regulations on such mat-\nters. District Trustees v. Trustees of Freestone County,\n186 S.W.  (2d) 378; District Trustees v. County Trustees,\n197 S.W.(2d) 579. Such existing discretionary power is,\nof course, subject at all times to the general laws of\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 7   (V-388)\n\n\nthe Legislature which may increase, modify or change\nthe statutory power existing in his office.\n          We are advised that the Dunbar Negro High\nSchool in the Texarkana Independent School District is\nan accredited school. H. B. 300 applies impartially\nto all school districts maintaining an accredited\nschool. The Legislature has seen fit to draw no dis-\ntinction as between white and colored schools in this\nenactment. In this the Legislature has followed Arti-\ncle VII, Section 7, of the Te,xasConstitution, which\nprovides for separate schools for white and colored\nchildren and says, vimpartial provision shall be made\nfor both.\" If the Legislature had this particular pro-\nvision in mind, no doubt it was due to the fact that\nthe Supreme Court of the United States has held on\nnumerous occasions that segregation (separate schools\nfor whites and negroes) can be lawfully enforced only\nwhen such separate schools furnish substantially equal\nfacilities.\n          Applying H. B. 300 to the Texarkana Independ-\nent School District which maintains one or more accred-\nited white and one or more accredited negru schools,\nit follows that no school in the district may be oon-\ntinued on the list of accredited schools, if the dis-\ntrict does not conform to the minimum salary require-\nments set out in Sections 1 and /or 2 of this Act.\n          To permit a school district to comply with\nthe minimum salary provisions of H. B. 300 with respect\nto some of its accredited schools or some of its schools\nseeking accreditation and not to comply therewith with\nrespect to all other accredited schools and schools seek-\ning accreditation within its confines would be to permit\na school district to classify and accredit its own schools,\na power and authority which it does not have under the\nlaw. Such an interpretation of Section 3 would amount\nto a repeal by implication of all the statutes governing\nthe accreditation of schools. To construe Section 3 of\nH. B. 300 as permitting such a practice would remove the\nenforceability of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Act, for\nunless Section 3 be construed to apply to the continuance\nor discontinuance on the list of all the accredited schools\nor school seeking accreditation of a district which com-\nplies or fails to comply with H. B. 300, it has no mean-\ning or force. It will not be presumed that the Legisla-\nture intended to enact a useless piece of legislation.\nFurther, to permit the practice contended for herein\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 0   (V-388)\n\n\nwould be to allow a local school district to discrimi-\nnate with respect to its negro and white schools, an\nact which would destroy all hope of maintaining the\nsegregated system of separate schools for negroes under\nthe terms of both the Texas Constitution and the Consti-\ntution of the United States.\n          To strike down Section 3 also would destroy\nthe constitutional authority exercised by the Legisla-\nture in providing a penalty for school districts which\nfail to pay their white teachers the minimum salaries\nprovided for from the large appropriation made specifi-\ncally and primarily for the much needed raise of teach-\ners' salaries throughout the State. The intent of Sec-\ntion 3 was publicly known to prevent certain districts\nfrom using the extra money for buying uniforms, building\nrepairs, reduction of local school taxes, and other such\npurposes instead of using it for increased teachers'\nsalaries. The revenues here involved are school reve-\nnues, arising by virtue of legislative enactments, and\nare public funds. It has been held many times that the\nLegislature through the enactment of general laws has\nplenary power in the management and operation of school\ndistricts to devote a certain amount of their revenue to\nthe payment of teachers' salaries. Fawlkes v. Wilson,\n171 S.W. (2d) 958; Fennel1 v. School District No. 13,\n187 S.W. (2d) 187; Art. VII, Sec. 3, Constitution of\nTexas.\n          For the reasons stated hereinabove, it is our\nopinion that the Legislature had the power to provide such\npenalty to insure the receipt by Texas school teachers of\nthe money intended for their increased salaries, and that\nSection 3 of H. B. 300 is constitutional.\n                       STJMMARY\n         Sec. 3 of H. B. 300, Regular Session, 50th\n    Leg., providing the penalty of loss of accre-\n    ditation of schools in any district which fails\n    to meet the required minimum teacher salary\n    schedule, or the highest possible schedule with-\n    in their financial ability, is constitutional.\n    If a district meets the minimum salary schedule,\n    higher salaries may be paid on the basis of ef-\n    ficiency, training, experience and other con- .\n    siderations. In H.B. 300 the Legislature has\n    provided for uniform higher salaries for all\n    school teachers without discrimination due to\n    race. Such impartial provision for both white\n\fHon. L. A. Woods, Page 9   (V-388)\n\n\n    and negro schools is in accordance with Arti-\n    cle VII, Sec. 7 of the Texas Constitution,\n    and is the only legal means of maintaining\n    segregated schools for white and negro pupils\n    under the Constitutions of Texas and the United\n    States and the decisions of the United States\n    Supreme Court, The penalty was primarily in-\n    tended to insure the actual use of additional\n    money furnished school districts for teachers'\n    salaries rather than for other school purposes.\n                               Very truly yours\n                           ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS\n\n\n                           BY -&&        2Tow\n                               Chester E.

Mr. Stilwell now claims\n           that he is no longer asking that the Dunbar\n           School be on the accredited list, since this\n           would force the Board of Trustees to pay the\n           Negro teachers on the same salary schedule as\n           the white teachers.\n                \"H. B. 300, an Act of the 50th Legisla-\n           ture, Regular Session, as interpreted by the\n           State Superintendent, means that an accred-\n           ited school system such as Texarkana must\n           operate both, an accredited Negro school and\n           an accredited white school, or must be seeking\n           accreditation for their Negro school and pay\n          ,their teachers the same salary schedule.\n\f                                                              . -\n\n\nHon. L. A. Woods - Page 2   (V-388)\n\n\n          YKr. Stilwell would like to know\n     first if the State Superintendent is act-\n     ing within his rights in determining that\n     an accredited school system such as Texar-\n     kana must be seeking accreditation for\n     their unaccredited Negro School; and second,\n     in order to avoid the penalty clause for\n     failing to pay all Negro teachers the same\n     salary as the white teachers he would like\n     to know whether the provision of Sec. 3 of\n     H. B. 300, which directs the State Super-\n     intendent to remove a school from the ac-\n     credited list of schools, is constitutional?n\n          Section 1 of H. B. 300, 50th Legislature, in\nmandatory language requires that the board of trustees\nof each and every Texas school district maintaining an\naccredited or affiliated elementary or high school, or\nseeking accreditation or affiliation, shall pay their\nteachers upon a salary schedule, which salary schedule\nshall provide a minimum beginnin salary for a full\ntime teacher of not less than (17 $2000.00 per year and\n(2) with increments above the minimum for (a) addition-\nal college training and (b) for experience and effi-\nciency in teaching. Such increments shall be paid upon\nthe schedule provided by the State aid law (H. El.295,\n50th Leg.). Section 1 requires further that beginning\nteachers in such school districts who do not have pre-\nvious teaching experience but who hold a bachelor's\ndegree or better shall be paid a minimum beginning sal-\nary of not less than $2,000,.00,and that teachers who do\nnot have such a degree shall be paid upon the salary\nschedule provided in the State Aid Law.\n          Section 1 applies to all school districts main-\ntaining such an accredited or affiliated school, or seek-\ning accreditation or affiliation, whether the district be\nself-operating or receiving State aid. There is no impli-\ncation in H. B. 300 that a school district must be subject\nto or eligible under the provisions of the State Aid Law\nbefore H. B. 300 will apply thereto. Rather than incor-\nporate in full the salary schedule and the increment sched-\nule provisions of the State Aid Law into H. B. 300, the\nLegislature has seen fit to incorporate same by werence\nfor the purposes therein set out, which it may legally do.\nFurthermore, it is clear the Legislature has specifically\nmade the provisions of H. B. 300 apply impartially to all\nthe teachers of such school districts regardless of race.\n\f               ,-\n\n\n\nHon. L. A. Woods - Page 3\n\n\nIt should be observed also that H. B. 300 is a minimum\nsalary law. It does not attempt to fix the maximum\nsalary whioh a district may pay its teachers. School\ndistricts may provide larger salaries above the mini-\nmum requirement of this bill for those of its teachers\nwho deserve monetary recognition for their efficiency\nin teaching. The increment schedule of the State Aid\nLaw, H. B. 295, Article III, Section 2, provides in-\ncrements only for additional college training and in-\ncrements for teaching experience. There are no fixed\nincrements providing for teaching efficiency except to\nthe extent that teaching efficiency may be regarded as\nthe natural result of teaching experience, but a dis-\ntrict which meets the minimum requirements may adopt a\nschedule for higher salaries based on efficiency and\nother valid considerations.\n          Section 2 of H. B. 300 is a recognition on\nthe part of the Legislature that some school districts\nmaintaining an accredited or affiliated school or seek-\ning accreditation or affiliation may not be able to\nmeet the minimum salary requirements set out in Section\n1 because of the insufficiency of school revenues. Sec-\ntion 2 provides in substance that if the total revenue\nof any school district will not permit the payment of\nthe salary requirement and increment schedule referred\nto in Section 1, when the total amount received from\nthe State per capita plus all additional State or Fed-\neral aid (except grants for school lunches) plus 4% of\ntotal current local maintenance tax are devoted to the\npayment of salaries of teachers, principals and super-\nvisors, then the highest salaries possible with revenue\navailable shall be paid by such district to its teachers.\nThis means that all such school districts not having\nsufficient revenues to comply fully with the provisions\nof Section 1 of H. B. 300, shall comply as nearly and\ncompletely as possible with Oection 1 and to the extent\nthat the revenues itemized in Section 2 will permit.\nFor example, if the total revenue of a district ear-\nmarked by Section 2 to be considered in the payment of\nits teachers’ salaries is but 90$ of the total amount\nneeded to oomply fully with Section 1 of said bill, then\nsuch a district shall pay teachers’ salaries on a 90$\nsalary sohedule, the highest salaries possible with the\nrevenue available. The fact that any such school dis-\ntriot cannot comply fully with the minimum salary re-\nquirements of Section 1 of said bill and thus comes with-\nin the provisions of Section 2, does not relieve it from\nthe other statutory requirements and obligations of,Seo-\ntion 1. In the instant example, all the teachers’ sala-\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 4   (V-388)\n\n\nries of such a 9C$ district should be at least 90% of\nwhat said minimum salaries would be if the district\ncould financially~conform to Section 1 of H. B. 300.\n            We are requested to pass upon the constitu-\ntionality of Section 3 of H. B. 300. Section 3 imposes\na statutory   duty on a body designated as the Committee\nof Affiliation and Accreditation. It is the duty of\nsaid Committee to require evidence from the State Super-\nintendent acting through his Deputy State Superintendents,\nshowing (1) that the provisions of H. B. 300, Section 1,\nare being fully complied with, or (2) that the salary\nschedule actually being paid is approved by both the\nState Superintendent and the State Board of Education,\nbefore any school of any such district is affiliated or\naccredited or continued on the list of affiliated or\naccredited schools. Under Section 2, such school dis-\ntricts are required to submit their salary schedules for\nthe payment of their teachers to the State Superintendent\nand through him to the State Board of Education for ap-\nproval.\n          The State Superintendent of Public Instruction\nis a statutory officer (Article 2655) and his general\nduties are outlined in Articles 2656 and 2657, V. C. S.\nHe is charged with the administration of the school laws\nand is given the superintendency of matters relating to\nthe public schools of this State. Article 2657, V .C.S.,\nprovides:\n          “The State Superintendent shall advise\n    and counsel with the school officers of the\n    counties,  cities and towns and school dis-\n    tricts as to the best methods of conducting\n    the public schools, and shall be empowered-to\n    issue instructions and’regulations binding for\n    obs,ervanceon all officers and teachers in.all ““”\n    cases wherein the orovisions of the school law ““‘“Y\n    may require interpretation in order to carry “-“’ ’\n    out the designs expressed therein, also in\n    cases that may arise in which the law hapsno\n    provision, and where necessity requires some\n    rule in order that there may be no hardships\n    to individuals, and no delays or inconvenience\n    in the management of school affairs.” (Empha-\n    sis ours)\n          Under Article 2678a, 2679 and 2681, V.C.S., the\nDepartment of Education has been authorized to classify\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 5   (V-388)\n\n\nand/or to prescribe rules and regulations for the\nclassification or ranking of every elementary school\nand high school of Texas. The legal basis for this\nclassification, zanking, or accreditation of Texas\nschools by the Department of Education acting through\nits head, the State Superintendent, finds its origin\nin Sections 3 and 5 of Chapter 36, Acts 1915, 34th\nLegislature, R. S., the provisions of which may be\ntraced and found in the above enumerated statutes.\nArticles 2888 and 2889, V.C.S., further authorize the\nState Superintendent to classify, rank or credit the\ninstitutions of higher learning in this State. Nixon\nClay Commercial College v. Woods, 176 S.W. (2d) 1015.\n          Since September 1916, the work of classifl-\ncation, accreditation and affillation of the schools\nof this State has been carried on by a committee under\nthe chairmanship of the State Superintendent of Public\nInstruction, which is described and consists of school\nrepresentatives named in the general manner set out in\nthe Regulations, Standards and Aotivities Bulletin No.\n469, published by the Department of Eclucation,pages 1\nto 6 inclusive. This committee is the body adopted\nand referred to by the Legislature in its H. B. 300 as\nthe Committee on Affiliation and Accreditation. For\n31 years.now this committee has been recommending and\nrevising the rules which should govern in the matter\nof classification and accreditation of public schools\nand the State Superintendent has exercised his statu-\ntory discretion found in Article 2657 in adopting same\nand prescribing such adopted recommendations as rules\nand regulations of the Department of Education on\nclassification and accreditation matters 0\n          The rules and regulations of the Department of\nEducation on the aocreditation and affiliation of the\npublic schools of Texas, when not in conflict with the\nlaws of this State, have the same force and binding ef-\nfect of a statute. Bear v. Donna Independent School Dis-\ntrict, 85 S.W. (2d) 797; 56 C. J.~,pages 333 and 489.\nHad this committee method of practice used by the6q+ part-\nment of Education in the formulation of its presen rules\nand regulations or, indeed, the rules and regulations\nthemselves, been contrary to the views of the Legisla-\nture, it is reasonable to presume that statutes governing\nthe State Superintendent in these matters would have been\namended long ago to meet such contrary views.

L. A. Woods - Page 6\n\n\n          Under Article VII, Section 1, Constitution of\nTexas, it is the duty of the Legislature to establish\nand make suitable provision for the support and maln-\ntenance of an efficient system of public free schools.\nSince it was necessary to establish and maintain a De-\npartment of Education to effectuate this provision, the\nLegislature has the undoubted power to delegate to said\nDepartment such power and authority as may be necessary\nto accomplish the end intended. The Legislature could\nnot possibly foresee all of the problems that would a-\nrise in the administration of the schools. Necessarily,\nthe Department’.ofEducation is given a wide discretion\nin such matters. It may make all such rules and regula-\ntions as in its judgment are necessary to maintain an\nefficient system of schools, subject to the provisions\nthat such regulations be not arbitrary, unreasonable or\nin violation of law. Mosely V. City of Dallas, 17 S.Wv.\n(2d) 36; R.C.L., Vol. 24, p. 575; Wilson v. Abilene In-\ndependent School District, 190 S.W. (2d) 406.\n          Until the passage of H. B. 300 by the 50th\nLegislature, matters concerning the classification and\naccreditation of schools have been left entirely within\nthe discretion of the State Superintendent, who has exer-\ncised such discretionary authority by prescribing the\npresent rules and regulations found in the submitted\nbulletin upon the recommendations of the’Committee on\nAffiliation and Accreditation. Bulletin, pages 16, 17,\n46, 47, 40 and 49. Section 3 of A. B. 300 imposes the\nfirst and only statutory duty on the said committee\nwhich has come to our attention. Said committee may not\nnow, by reason of Section 3, recommend the accreditation\nor affiliation of any school of any district which does\nnot conform to the minimum salary provisions of Section\n1 and/or Section 2 of H. B. 300, nor may it recommend\nthe continuance of any school of any district on the ac-\ncredited or affiliated list where any school of any dis-\ntrict fails or refuses to meet the provisions thereof.\n           The authority to classify or accredit schools\ndoes not rest, as seems to be contended in this opinion\nrequest, in the board of trustees of a local school dis-\ntrict. Such authority lies in the State Superintendent\nwho has been empowered under statutes hereinabove enum-\nerated to promulgate rules and regulations on such mat-\nters. District Trustees v. Trustees of Freestone County,\n186 S.W.  (2d) 378; District Trustees v. County Trustees,\n197 S.W.(2d) 579. Such existing discretionary power is,\nof course, subject at all times to the general laws of\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 7   (V-388)\n\n\nthe Legislature which may increase, modify or change\nthe statutory power existing in his office.\n          We are advised that the Dunbar Negro High\nSchool in the Texarkana Independent School District is\nan accredited school. H. B. 300 applies impartially\nto all school districts maintaining an accredited\nschool. The Legislature has seen fit to draw no dis-\ntinction as between white and colored schools in this\nenactment. In this the Legislature has followed Arti-\ncle VII, Section 7, of the Te,xasConstitution, which\nprovides for separate schools for white and colored\nchildren and says, vimpartial provision shall be made\nfor both.\" If the Legislature had this particular pro-\nvision in mind, no doubt it was due to the fact that\nthe Supreme Court of the United States has held on\nnumerous occasions that segregation (separate schools\nfor whites and negroes) can be lawfully enforced only\nwhen such separate schools furnish substantially equal\nfacilities.\n          Applying H. B. 300 to the Texarkana Independ-\nent School District which maintains one or more accred-\nited white and one or more accredited negru schools,\nit follows that no school in the district may be oon-\ntinued on the list of accredited schools, if the dis-\ntrict does not conform to the minimum salary require-\nments set out in Sections 1 and /or 2 of this Act.\n          To permit a school district to comply with\nthe minimum salary provisions of H. B. 300 with respect\nto some of its accredited schools or some of its schools\nseeking accreditation and not to comply therewith with\nrespect to all other accredited schools and schools seek-\ning accreditation within its confines would be to permit\na school district to classify and accredit its own schools,\na power and authority which it does not have under the\nlaw. Such an interpretation of Section 3 would amount\nto a repeal by implication of all the statutes governing\nthe accreditation of schools. To construe Section 3 of\nH. B. 300 as permitting such a practice would remove the\nenforceability of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Act, for\nunless Section 3 be construed to apply to the continuance\nor discontinuance on the list of all the accredited schools\nor school seeking accreditation of a district which com-\nplies or fails to comply with H. B. 300, it has no mean-\ning or force. It will not be presumed that the Legisla-\nture intended to enact a useless piece of legislation.\nFurther, to permit the practice contended for herein\n\fHon. L. A. Woods - Page 0   (V-388)\n\n\nwould be to allow a local school district to discrimi-\nnate with respect to its negro and white schools, an\nact which would destroy all hope of maintaining the\nsegregated system of separate schools for negroes under\nthe terms of both the Texas Constitution and the Consti-\ntution of the United States.\n          To strike down Section 3 also would destroy\nthe constitutional authority exercised by the Legisla-\nture in providing a penalty for school districts which\nfail to pay their white teachers the minimum salaries\nprovided for from the large appropriation made specifi-\ncally and primarily for the much needed raise of teach-\ners' salaries throughout the State. The intent of Sec-\ntion 3 was publicly known to prevent certain districts\nfrom using the extra money for buying uniforms, building\nrepairs, reduction of local school taxes, and other such\npurposes instead of using it for increased teachers'\nsalaries. The revenues here involved are school reve-\nnues, arising by virtue of legislative enactments, and\nare public funds. It has been held many times that the\nLegislature through the enactment of general laws has\nplenary power in the management and operation of school\ndistricts to devote a certain amount of their revenue to\nthe payment of teachers' salaries. Fawlkes v. Wilson,\n171 S.W. (2d) 958; Fennel1 v. School District No. 13,\n187 S.W. (2d) 187; Art. VII, Sec. 3, Constitution of\nTexas.\n          For the reasons stated hereinabove, it is our\nopinion that the Legislature had the power to provide such\npenalty to insure the receipt by Texas school teachers of\nthe money intended for their increased salaries, and that\nSection 3 of H. B. 300 is constitutional.\n                       STJMMARY\n         Sec. 3 of H. B. 300, Regular Session, 50th\n    Leg., providing the penalty of loss of accre-\n    ditation of schools in any district which fails\n    to meet the required minimum teacher salary\n    schedule, or the highest possible schedule with-\n    in their financial ability, is constitutional.\n    If a district meets the minimum salary schedule,\n    higher salaries may be paid on the basis of ef-\n    ficiency, training, experience and other con- .\n    siderations. In H.B. 300 the Legislature has\n    provided for uniform higher salaries for all\n    school teachers without discrimination due to\n    race. Such impartial provision for both white\n\fHon. L. A. Woods, Page 9   (V-388)\n\n\n    and negro schools is in accordance with Arti-\n    cle VII, Sec. 7 of the Texas Constitution,\n    and is the only legal means of maintaining\n    segregated schools for white and negro pupils\n    under the Constitutions of Texas and the United\n    States and the decisions of the United States\n    Supreme Court, The penalty was primarily in-\n    tended to insure the actual use of additional\n    money furnished school districts for teachers'\n    salaries rather than for other school purposes.\n                               Very truly yours\n                           ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS\n\n\n                           BY -&&        2Tow\n                               Chester E.
