rather, it noted that multiple people were\r\nliving in the target address and requested permission to seize electronic\r\ndevices regardless of ownership.  As justification, the affidavit explained\r\nthat electronic information may be easily moved between different computers and\r\nother electronic storage devices.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 6.<span>            \r\n</span>Reciting general information about the large volume of information\r\nstored on a computer, the technical expertise required to search data that can\r\nbe hidden, password protected, or encrypted, and the time involved in such a\r\nsearch, the application requested authorization to seize any computers for\r\nsearch off-site.  The application further stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In some cases, it is possible for law\r\nenforcement officers and forensic examiners to conduct carefully targeted\r\nsearches that can locate evidence without requiring a time-consuming manual\r\nsearch through unrelated materials that may be commingled with criminal\r\nevidence.  In other cases, however, such techniques may not yield the\r\nevidence described in the warrant.  Criminals can mislabel or hide files\r\nand directories, encode communications to avoid using key words, attempt to\r\ndelete files to evade detection, or take other steps designed to frustrate law\r\nenforcement searches for information.  These steps may require agents and\r\nlaw enforcement or other analysts with appropriate expertise to conduct more\r\nextensive searches, such as scanning areas of the disk not allocated to listed\r\nfiles, or peruse every file briefly to determine whether it falls within the\r\nscope of the warrant.  In light of these difficulties, the [applicant]<b><i>\r\n</i></b>intends to use whatever data analysis techniques appear necessary to\r\nlocate and retrieve the evidence . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 7.<span>            \r\n</span>The judicial officer reviewing the request granted a warrant to search\r\nthe residence and to seize electronic devices to be searched at an off-site\r\nfacility for as long as reasonably necessary.  In a separate order,\r\nhowever, the judicial officer stated only that “[t]he application to search the\r\ncomputer belonging to Eric Gulfield is <u>granted</u>,” and attached\r\nconditions: (1) restricting the police from relying on the plain view\r\ndoctrine to seize any incriminatory electronic record not authorized by the\r\nwarrant—that is, “any digital evidence relating to criminal matters other than\r\nidentity theft offenses”; (2) requiring third parties or specially trained\r\ncomputer personnel to conduct the search behind a “firewall” and provide to\r\nState investigatory agents only “digital evidence relating to identity theft\r\noffenses”<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[2]</span></span><span></span><span></span>;\r\n(3) requiring digital evidence relating to the offenses to be segregated\r\nand redacted from surrounding non-evidentiary data before being delivered to\r\nthe case investigators, “no matter how intermingled it is”; (4) precluding\r\nState police personnel who are involved in conducting the search under\r\ncondition (2) from disclosing their work to prosecutors or investigators;\r\n(5) limiting the search protocol to methods designed to uncover only\r\ninformation for which the State has probable cause; (6) precluding the use\r\nof specialized “hashing tools” and “similar search tools” without specific\r\nauthorization of the court; (7) allowing only evidence “relevant to the targeted\r\nalleged activities” to be copied to provide to State agents; (8) requiring\r\nthe State to return “non-responsive data” and to inform the court of this\r\naction; (9) directing police to destroy remaining copies of electronic\r\ndata absent judicial authorization otherwise; and (10) requiring the State\r\nto file a return within the time limit of the warrant<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[3]</span></span><span></span><span></span> to indicate precisely what data was\r\nobtained, returned, and destroyed.  Law enforcement conducted a search of\r\nthe premises and seized, but did not search, a personal computer and an iPad.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[4]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 8.<span>            \r\n</span>The State then filed a motion for extraordinary relief in this Court requesting\r\nthat the Court strike the ex ante conditions from the warrant.  In support\r\nof its petition, the State argues that the judicial officer lacked authority to\r\nimpose ex ante restrictions on the search; that the conditions are unnecessary\r\nand impede legal development in the area of computer searches; and that the\r\nconditions impermissibly impede effective law enforcement investigation. \r\nThe Defender General and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[5]</span></span><span></span><span></span> submitted briefs as amici curiae in\r\nopposition to the State’s petition.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[6]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n The ACLU argues that computers are fundamentally different from paper\r\nrecords or filing cabinets because of the vast volume of personal data stored\r\nin a computer and due to a computer’s unique ability to retain hidden and\r\ndeleted information and to act as a portal to other remote storages of\r\ninformation.  To protect privacy, the ACLU argues that the Fourth\r\nAmendment demands more stringent requirements to search electronic\r\ndevices.  The Defender General argues that such conditions are key to\r\nprotecting privacy under Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution. \r\nTherefore, both amici contend that the conditions are necessary and not beyond\r\nthe judge’s discretion in issuing a warrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 9.<span>            \r\n</span>We first must address the jurisdictional grounds for this action. \r\nThis is an original jurisdiction case instigated by the State’s direct petition\r\nfor extraordinary relief.  Extraordinary relief is a “flexible procedure” that\r\nis available when all other avenues are closed.  <u>In re Vt. Sup. Ct.\r\nAdmin. Directive No. 17</u>, 154 Vt. 392, 397, 579 A.2d 1036, 1039\r\n(1990).  Extraordinary relief is, however, limited to when “there is no\r\nadequate remedy by appeal” or by filing for extraordinary relief in the\r\nsuperior court.  V.R.A.P. 21(b).  In this case, there is no remedy by\r\nappeal because the State has no right of appeal from a judge’s decision to\r\ngrant, but condition, a warrant request.  See 13 V.S.A. § 7403 (limiting\r\nState’s ability to appeal in criminal cases to situations where prosecution has\r\nbegun).  The State argued that this is a rare case where extraordinary\r\nrelief is appropriately brought in this Court in the first instance because the\r\nissue raised is a pure question of law that requires no factual\r\ndevelopment.  Cf. <u>In re Hill</u>, 149 Vt. 86, 86, 539 A.2d 992, 993\r\n(1987) (per curiam) (dismissing petition for extraordinary relief where issues\r\ncould be dealt with in the course of litigation and on appeal if necessary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 10.<span>        \r\n</span>The Defender General moved to dismiss the petition for lack of\r\njurisdiction, arguing that there was no live controversy because the State’s\r\ncontention of injury was speculative and that there were other available means\r\nfor relief.  The Defender General contended that the State should file its\r\npetition for extraordinary relief in the civil division in the first instance\r\nfor further factual development.  This Court denied the motion.  We\r\nnow reaffirm that denial.  The petition for relief may be decided by this\r\nCourt in the first instance given that the State is challenging the judicial\r\nofficer’s authority to impose the conditions, as in the nature of a mandamus\r\naction, which is a purely legal question that requires no evidentiary\r\nanalysis.  See, e.g., <u>State v. Saari</u>, 152 Vt. 510, 514-15, 568 A.2d\r\n344, 347 (1989).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 11.<span>        \r\n</span>Although we conclude that there is jurisdiction, we also emphasize that\r\nextraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus is a limited remedy.  It is\r\nto be granted only when the State shows that the judge’s decisions “were\r\nusurpations of judicial power, <u>clear</u> abuses of discretion, or arbitrary\r\nabuses of power.”  <u>State v. Pratt</u>, 173 Vt. 562, 563, 795 A.2d 1148,\r\n1149 (2002) (mem.).  Therefore, we must determine whether the judicial\r\nofficer’s decision to impose ex ante restrictions was an abuse of power,\r\nclearly contrary to law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 12.<span>        \r\n</span>Having found jurisdiction, we consider the scope of this appeal. \r\nThe central premise of the judicial officer who issued the warrant, a premise\r\nreiterated by amici, is that the State is bound by the warrant conditions,\r\nhereinafter referred to as instructions.  In general, this is settled law:\r\nwarrant instructions are binding so that a violation of them renders the search\r\nunconstitutional.  <u>United States v. Brunette</u>, 76 F. Supp. 2d 30, 42\r\n(D. Me. 1999) (“It is settled law that the search and seizure of evidence,\r\nconducted under a warrant, must conform to the requirements of that\r\nwarrant.”).  Enforcing an issuing judicial officer’s directions ensures\r\nthat the warrant requirement is meaningful and effective.  See <u>United\r\nStates v. Leon</u>, 468 U.S. 897, 914 (1984) (“[T]he preference for warrants is\r\nmost appropriately effectuated by according ‘great deference’ to a magistrate’s\r\ndetermination.” (quoting <u>Spinelli v. United States</u>, 393 U.S. 410, 419\r\n(1969))).  Thus, for example, a failure to abide by the warrant’s time\r\nrestrictions may be cause for suppression of evidence obtained in the search\r\npursuant to the warrant.  See <u>Sgro v. United States</u>, 287 U.S. 206,\r\n211 (1932); <u>United States v. Bedford</u>, 519 F.2d 650, 655 (3d Cir. 1975)\r\n(“If the police were allowed to execute the warrant at leisure, the safeguard\r\nof judicial control over the search which the fourth amendment is intended to\r\naccomplish would be eviscerated.”). </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 13.<span>        \r\n</span>The State argues, however, that this settled law does not apply to ex\r\nante instructions—that is, instructions imposed with the warrant on how to\r\nexecute the warrant.  The instructions in this case are ex ante\r\ninstructions.  Essentially, the State’s position is that the requirements\r\nof the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and Chapter I, Article 11\r\nof the Vermont Constitution do not extend to such instructions so that\r\nviolation of these instructions would not itself make the search\r\nunconstitutional.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[7]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nSecondarily, the State argues that the judicial officer does not have the power\r\nto issue such instructions under Vermont law so they are invalid irrespective\r\nof the constitutional mandate.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 14.<span>        \r\n</span>The issues in this case are unlike the search and seizure questions that\r\nwe have resolved in the past.  The difference involves the nature of the\r\nconstitutional guarantee, as a right of a citizen to be free from a search\r\nand/or seizure that does not comport with constitutional requirements.  In\r\nthe usual case, a criminal defendant argues that certain evidence to be used by\r\nthe State was obtained in violation of the constitutional mandate and cannot be\r\nused against defendant in the criminal proceeding.  Here, the issue is\r\nwhether the judicial officer in approving a search warrant can add instructions\r\nto protect the privacy interests of the person to be searched.  The issue\r\nhas never been addressed directly by the U.S. Supreme Court and has rarely been\r\naddressed by lower federal courts or courts in other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 15.<span>        \r\n</span>While the State has argued briefly that Article 11 creates no greater\r\npower to issue ex ante instructions as part of the constitutional mandate, and\r\nthe Defender General argues to the contrary urging us to ground our decision on\r\nthe Vermont Constitution, this case is fundamentally about the reach of the\r\nFourth Amendment.  The judicial officer relied upon Fourth Amendment\r\ndecisions in imposing the instructions, and the parties have relied upon Fourth\r\nAmendment decisions in their arguments to this Court.  In part, this is\r\nbecause there are no state constitution precedents.  To be sure, we have\r\nnoted on many occasions that Article 11 “may offer protections beyond those\r\nprovided by the Fourth Amendment,” <u>State v. Roberts</u>, 160 Vt. 385, 392,\r\n631 A.2d 835, 840 (1993), and this case could involve a variation of this\r\nprinciple.  Our first impression, however, is that this case is less about\r\nthe scope of protections of a constitutional provision and more about the tools\r\navailable to ensure that protection occurs.  Thus, any holding we might\r\nultimately make concerning the scope of Article 11 with respect to ex ante\r\ninstructions will be based on a new analysis of the protections of that Article. \r\nIn view of our disposition of the case under the Fourth Amendment, we decline\r\nto engage in such an analysis in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 16.<span>        \r\n</span>Nor do we rest our decision on Vermont non-constitutional law. \r\nWhile the State argued that Vermont law does not authorize a judicial officer\r\nto impose ex ante instructions, it addressed only Vermont Rule of Criminal\r\nProcedure 41.  It argued that this criminal procedure rule does not\r\nauthorize the magistrate to issue instructions on how the search shall be\r\nconducted.  Although Rule 41 is relevant,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[8]</span></span><span></span><span></span> neither it, nor the federal rule on which\r\nit is based, purport to completely define the scope of judicial power with\r\nrespect to search warrants.  Thus, we are not persuaded on this limited\r\nrecord that Vermont law supports the State’s argument and do not consider it\r\nfurther.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 17.<span>        \r\n</span>Before addressing the substantive claims of error raised, we briefly\r\nmake three points that put our analysis in context and respond to one of the\r\npoints made by the dissent.  First, there are really two searches in this\r\ncase—the first for the computer and the second of the computer.  The first\r\nhas occurred and is not in dispute; the issues relate solely to the second\r\nsearch.  Second, the principal question before us is whether the\r\nwarrant-issuing magistrate had the authority to issue the specific search\r\ninstructions he did, not as the dissent suggests, whether imposing the\r\ninstructions is necessary to comply with the Fourth Amendment or Chapter I,\r\nArticle 11 of the Vermont Constitution.  Third, the State has challenged\r\nthe imposition (or effect) of the instructions in general.  Assuming such\r\ninstructions could be imposed and they are binding under either the federal or\r\nstate constitution, the State has not argued that they were inappropriate in\r\nthis case.  We leave questions about the nature and extent of the\r\nmagistrate’s discretion in this area to another day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 18.<span>        \r\n</span>We now proceed to the main question before us—whether a judicial officer\r\nissuing a warrant has the authority to place ex ante instructions on how a\r\nsearch may be conducted.  We have stated the question broadly because the\r\nState has challenged the authority of the judicial officer to impose any ex\r\nante instructions, not particularly those in this case.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[9]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  We also emphasize that the general\r\nquestion is one of authority, and not responsibility.  No party or amicus\r\nis directly claiming that ex ante instructions are ever required, and we\r\ncertainly do not hold so here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 19.<span>        \r\n</span>Under the Fourth Amendment, people are protected “against unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures.”  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  This right is echoed\r\nin the Vermont Constitution, which protects people’s right to be “free from\r\nsearch or seizure.”  Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 11.  “Absent exceptional\r\ncircumstances, the federal and state constitutions instruct executive officers\r\nto conduct searches pursuant to a warrant issued by an impartial\r\nmagistrate.”  <u>State v. Quigley</u>, 2005 VT 128, ¶ 11, 179 Vt. 567, 892\r\nA.2d 211.  Warrants may not be granted “but upon probable cause, supported\r\nby Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,\r\nand the persons or things to be seized.”  U.S. Const. amend. IV; see Vt.\r\nConst. ch. I, art. 11 (requiring that warrants be supported by a “sufficient\r\nfoundation” and with the items to be seized “particularly described”); see also\r\n<u>United States v.

Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (CDT I)</u>, 579\r\nF.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).  That case arose out of a 2002 federal\r\ninvestigation into the Bay Area Lab Cooperative (Balco), which the government\r\nsuspected of providing illegal steroids to professional baseball players. \r\nThat year, Major League Baseball and the Player’s Association agreed to test\r\nall players to determine if more than five percent of players tested positive\r\nfor steroid use.  Under the agreement, the results of the testing of\r\nindividual players were to be kept confidential.  The samples were\r\ncollected by an independent business, Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (CDT),\r\nand the tests were performed by a private laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, Inc.\r\n CDT retained the list of players and their respective test results while\r\nQuest kept the specimens.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 21.<span>        \r\n</span>As part of its Balco investigation, the government developed probable cause\r\nto believe ten players tested positive for steroids.  The government\r\nsecured a grand jury subpoena to obtain all drug testing records and specimens\r\nin CDT’s possession.  The players moved to quash this subpoena.  The\r\ngovernment also obtained a warrant authorizing a search of CDT.  Although\r\nthe warrant was limited to the records of the ten players for whom the\r\ngovernment had probable cause, when the government executed the warrant, law\r\nenforcement seized and reviewed the drug testing records for hundreds of\r\nbaseball players as well as other individuals.  Litigation ensued\r\nchallenging the government’s action.  CDT and the players moved for return\r\nof property under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), and the players\r\nmoved to quash the subpoena.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 22.<span>        \r\n</span>The motions were heard by three different district court judges who all\r\nruled against the government, granting the motions to return property and\r\nquashing the subpoena.  All “expressed grave dissatisfaction with the\r\ngovernment’s handling of the investigation.”  <u>Id</u>. at 994.  On\r\nappeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\r\nreversed two decisions, concluding that the government’s seizure did not\r\nviolate the law.  <u>United States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing Inc.</u>,\r\n473 F.3d 915 (9th Cir. 2006).  The court then granted a rehearing en banc<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[10]</span></span><span></span><span></span> and upheld the district court orders,\r\nfinding against the government.  Following its detailed analysis of the\r\ncase, the court included some “Concluding Thoughts” regarding the challenge of\r\nbalancing law enforcement’s need “for broad authorization to examine electronic\r\nrecords” with the “serious risk that every warrant for electronic information\r\nwill become, in effect, a general warrant, rendering the Fourth Amendment\r\nirrelevant.”  <u>CDT I</u>, 579 F.3d at 1004.  Noting that it was\r\nbest “if there are clear rules to follow that strike a fair balance between the\r\nlegitimate needs of law enforcement and the right of individuals and\r\nenterprises to the privacy that is at the heart of the Fourth Amendment,” the\r\ncourt outlined a list of “guidance” for magistrates to employ when issuing\r\nwarrants for search of electronic devices.  <u>Id</u>. at 1006.  This\r\nincluded: insisting the government waive reliance on the plain view doctrine;\r\nrequiring segregation or redaction of data by an independent third party prior\r\nto release to investigators; requiring the government to use a search protocol\r\ndesigned to uncover only information for which there is probable cause; and\r\nmandating that the government destroy or return nonresponsive data.  <u>Id</u>.\r\n <u>CDT I</u> emphasized the need for such restrictions to prevent\r\ngovernment overreaching, as had occurred in that case, and to protect the\r\nprivacy interests of third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 23.<span>        \r\n</span>Dissatisfied, the government then moved for review by all twenty-one\r\nactive judges of the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the search protocols announced\r\nin the decision were unnecessary to resolve the case, beyond the court’s\r\nauthority, and harmful to ongoing government investigations.  Brief for\r\nthe United States in Support of Rehearing En Banc by the Full Court, <u>CDT I</u>,\r\n579 F.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2009) (Nos. 05-10067, 05-15006, 05-55354).  In\r\nresponse, the initial en banc decision was revised and replaced with <u>United\r\nStates v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (CDT II)</u>, 621 F.3d 1162 (9th\r\nCir. 2010) (en banc) (per curiam).  While the revised decision retained\r\nthe substantive analysis and legal outcome of <u>CDT I</u>, the guidelines were\r\nremoved from the per curiam opinion, and instead were included in a\r\nconcurrence.  <u>CDT II</u>, 621 F.3d at 1180 (Kozinski, C.J.,\r\nconcurring).  The instructions adopted by the judicial officer in this\r\ncase are drawn from the guidelines that were set forth in <u>CDT I</u> and\r\nretained only in the concurring opinion in <u>CDT II</u>.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 24.<span>        \r\n</span>The State contends that the judicial officer in this case lacked\r\nauthority to impose the instructions at issue.  In the State’s view,\r\nrather than authorizing a search at a particular location or for particular\r\nitems, the judicial officer was attempting to dictate <u>how</u> law\r\nenforcement must conduct its search.  In making this argument, the State\r\ndraws heavily on an article written by Professor Orin Kerr following <u>CDT I</u>. \r\nSee O. Kerr, <u>Ex Ante Regulation of Computer Search and Seizure</u>, 96 Va.\r\nL. Rev. 1241, 1242 (2010).  Professor Kerr argues that “ex ante\r\nrestrictions on the execution of computer search warrants are constitutionally\r\nunauthorized and unwise.”  <u>Id</u>.  He contends that ex ante\r\nrestrictions are impermissible because they predetermine the reasonableness of\r\na search—a matter that he contends is beyond a magistrate’s authority under the\r\nFourth Amendment.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[11]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nAccording to this view, an issuing officer’s role is only to determine whether\r\nprobable cause exists to search a given location, not to determine the manner\r\nin which a search may be conducted.  Drawing on Professor Kerr’s argument,\r\nthe State contends that the judicial officer exceeded the narrowly\r\ncircumscribed role of an officer reviewing a warrant application and, thus, its\r\ninstructions are not part of the constitutional mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 25.<span>        \r\n</span>The permissibility of imposing the ex ante instructions on computer\r\nsearches is a relatively novel question for courts generally.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[12]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  What tools are at the disposal of\r\njudicial officers in confronting the challenges presented by searches of\r\nelectronic media is a real and important question.  As one court\r\nsuccinctly put it: “Computers are simultaneously file cabinets (with millions\r\nof files) and locked desk drawers; they can be repositories of innocent and\r\ndeeply personal information, but also of evidence of crimes.  The former\r\nmust be protected, the latter discovered.”  <u>United States v. Adjani</u>,\r\n452 F.3d 1140, 1152 (9th Cir. 2006).  We are not called upon to decide\r\ntoday how these conflicting goals are best satisfied.  Our question is not\r\nwhether the judicial officer’s attempt to reconcile these objectives was\r\nrecommendable, much less required.  Our question is simply whether this\r\nattempt was such a clear abuse of authority as to merit our prohibition in the\r\ncontext of this petition for extraordinary relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 26.<span>        \r\n</span>In this light, we reject the State’s invitation to hold that all ex ante\r\nrestrictions on the execution of a search warrant are universally of no effect\r\nin defining the constitutional requirement.  Although the historical\r\nrecord is sparse at this point, we see no bright line that allows some\r\nconditions, but not ones that specify how law enforcement officials must\r\nconduct their search.  Indeed, the evidence from Vermont suggests that\r\nsuch ex ante instructions have been used in the past.  See discussion <u>supra</u>\r\nnote 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 27.<span>        \r\n</span>We conclude that ex ante instructions are sometimes acceptable\r\nmechanisms for ensuring the particularity of a search.  According to\r\nProfessor Kerr’s argument, which the State would have us adopt, a judicial\r\nofficer’s only concern ex ante should be with probable cause and particularity,\r\nnot reasonableness.  Kerr, <u>supra</u>, at 1290-91 (“[E]x ante assessment\r\nof probable cause and particularity serves a different function than ex ante\r\nassessment of how a search should be\r\nexecuted.”).  Accepting arguendo that such a bright dividing line exists,\r\nex ante instructions may be a way to ensure particularity.  Even in\r\ntraditional contexts, a judicial officer may restrict a search to only a\r\nportion of what was requested—a room rather than an entire house, or boxes with\r\ncertain labels rather than an entire warehouse.  In other words, some ex\r\nante constraints—of the form “here, not there”—are perfectly acceptable. \r\nWarrant applications describing the proposed scope of a search are not\r\nsubmitted to the court on a take it or leave it basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 28.<span>        \r\n</span>Often the way to specify particular objects or spaces will not be by\r\ndescribing their physical coordinates but by describing how to locate\r\nthem.  This is especially true in the world of electronic information,\r\nwhere physical notions of particularity are metaphorical at best.  Cf. J.\r\nGoldfoot, <u>The Physical Computer and the Fourth Amendment</u>, 16 Berkeley J.\r\nCrim. L. 112, 123-24 (2011) (“The initial decision to treat storage media as\r\nhaving subcontainers departs from physical moorings; after that departure,\r\nmetaphors are necessary to apply physical rules to the new virtual world.”).\r\n Although the details of computer searches are new and evolving, the need\r\nfor a non-physical concept of particularity is one that courts have already\r\nconfronted.  Warrants for electronic surveillance routinely set out\r\n“minimization” requirements—procedures for how and under what conditions the\r\nelectronic surveillance may be conducted—in order to “afford[] similar\r\nprotections to those that are present in the use of conventional warrants\r\nauthorizing the seizure of tangible evidence.”  <u>Berger v. New York</u>,\r\n388 U.S. 41, 57 (1967); see, e.g., <u>Ricks v. State</u>, 537 A.2d 612, 621\r\n(Md. 1988) (describing specific minimization procedures such as when camera\r\nshould be turned on and off and what could and could not be recorded in 22-page\r\norder granting warrant for video surveillance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 29.<span>        \r\n</span>At this point, many jurisdictions have adopted statutes that not only\r\npermit, but require, that warrants for electronic surveillance include procedures\r\nfor minimizing the capture of non-pertinent information.  See, e.g., N.Y.\r\nCrim. Pro. Law § 700.30 (requiring that warrants contain “[a] provision that\r\nthe authorization to intercept or conduct video surveillance . . . shall be\r\nconducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications or\r\nthe making of observations not otherwise subject to eavesdropping or video\r\nsurveillance”).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[13]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nThese provisions in the warrants are ex ante conditions on how a search may be\r\nconducted, but we believe that they are well within the scope of a judicial\r\nofficer’s role in ensuring that searches are targeted with sufficient\r\nparticularity.  The same reasoning applies with even more force in the\r\ncomputer context.  In the digital universe, particular information is not\r\naccessed through corridors and drawers, but through commands and queries. \r\nAs a result, in many cases, the only feasible way to specify a particular\r\n“region” of the computer will be by specifying how to search.  We view\r\nsuch ex ante specification as an acceptable way to determine\r\nparticularity.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 30.<span>        \r\n</span>Further, we do not agree that one can draw a categorical line between\r\nthe probable cause inquiry and considerations of privacy.  Professor\r\nKerr’s argument suggests that consideration of the privacy interests of the\r\nperson to be searched is ultimately irrelevant to a judicial officer issuing a\r\nwarrant.  See Kerr, <u>supra</u>, at 1290-92.  But this picture is\r\noverly rigid, ignoring the fact that the relevant ex ante standards depend on\r\nthe severity of the privacy infringement that is contemplated.  A judicial\r\nofficer might authorize a search of a person, including his pockets, without\r\nany particular basis for thinking that evidence will be found in the person’s\r\npocket as opposed to elsewhere on his person.  But that same officer might\r\npermissibly refuse to authorize a search of the person’s body cavities based on\r\nevidence of similar generality.  See, e.g., <u>United States v. Nelson</u>,\r\n36 F.3d 758, 760 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding that probable cause to search\r\ndefendant’s “person” did not include probable cause to perform a body cavity\r\nsearch and that this case clearly exhibits “[t]he need to provide specificity\r\nin a warrant”).  This is not because a person’s rectal cavity is, in any\r\nmeaningful sense, a more “particular” or “specific” location than his left\r\npocket,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[14]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nbut because concerns for privacy inflect our understanding of probable cause\r\nand particularity.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[15]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 31.<span>        \r\n</span>What we ask judicial officers to ensure, therefore, is not simply that\r\nthere is a reason to believe evidence may be uncovered but that there is a\r\nreason that will justify an intrusion on a citizen’s privacy interest.\r\n The investigatory promise must justify the collateral exposure.  See\r\n<u>State v. Savva</u>, 159 Vt. 75, 86, 616 A.2d 774, 780 (1991) (“Although\r\ncriminal defendants may seek court review of searches and seizures, these\r\nafter-the-fact challenges do not serve Article 11’s purpose of protecting the\r\nrights of everyone—law-abiding as well as criminal—by involving judicial\r\noversight <u>before</u> would-be invasions of privacy.” (emphasis\r\nadded)).  It is therefore essential that a judicial officer be cognizant\r\nof the general type of invasion being proposed.  Where the invasion is\r\nless, a judicial officer may be more willing to issue the warrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 32.<span>        \r\n</span>As a corollary, judicial officers may describe in general terms what\r\nsort of an invasion is authorized.  See <u>United States v. Banks</u>, 540\r\nU.S. 31, 36 (2003) (“[A] magistrate judge is acting within the Constitution to\r\nauthorize a ‘no-knock’ entry.”); V.R.Cr.P. 41(c) (requiring that warrants\r\n“shall command the officer to search[] within a specified period of time”; that\r\nthey shall be executed during the daytime “unless the warrant directs that it\r\nmay be served at any time”; and that they shall “designate the court to which\r\nit shall be returned”); cf. <u>Scott v. United States</u>, 436 U.S. 128, 130\r\n(1978) (contemplating “judicial authorization which\r\nrequired . . . minimization” of wiretap under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2518).  To say this is not to deny that the ex ante perspective of the\r\nissuing officer is to some extent limited.  Judicial officers should not\r\nmicromanage the execution of the warrant.  See <u>Lo-Ji Sales</u>, 442\r\nU.S. at 326-27.  And because the ex ante assessment is general, it will\r\nnot foreclose ex post reassessment insofar as “the Magistrate could not have\r\nanticipated in every particular the circumstances that would confront the\r\nofficers.”  <u>Richards</u>, 520 U.S. at 396.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[16]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 33.<span>        \r\n</span>It is a serious error, however, to infer from the fact that we must\r\noften evaluate ex post whether a search sufficiently respected a citizen’s privacy\r\nto the conclusion that we can make no ex ante judgments about what sort of\r\nprivacy invasions are and are not warranted.  There is interplay between\r\nprobable cause, particularity, and reasonableness that judicial officers\r\nreviewing a warrant application must consider in authorizing a form of privacy\r\ninvasion.  We therefore reject any blanket prohibition on ex ante search\r\nwarrant instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\" align=\"center\">IV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 34.<span>        \r\n</span>Having rejected a categorical prohibition on ex ante instructions, we\r\nexamine the specific instructions imposed by the judicial officer in this case\r\nand consider whether each was an abuse of authority.  For clarity in our\r\nanalysis, we group the instructions into the following categories: the\r\nfirst—instruction (1) relating to the plain view doctrine; the\r\nsecond—instructions (2), (3), and (4) requiring that the search be performed by\r\nthird parties or police personnel segregated from the investigators and\r\nrequiring that the information be segregated and redacted prior to disclosure;\r\nthe third—instructions (5) and (6) requiring police to use focused search\r\ntechniques and prohibiting the use of specialized search tools without prior\r\ncourt authorization; and the fourth—instructions (7), (8), (9), and (10)\r\npertaining to the copying, destruction and return of data.  We address\r\neach of these categories in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\" align=\"center\">A.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 35.<span>        \r\n</span>First, we consider instruction (1) related to the plain view\r\ndoctrine.  Generally, only the items specifically described in a search\r\nwarrant may be seized by law enforcement officers.  Under the plain view\r\ndoctrine, however, “if police are lawfully in a position from which they view\r\nan object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if\r\nofficers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without\r\na warrant.”  <u>Minnesota v.

Trudeau</u>, 165 Vt. 355, 358, 683 A.2d 725, 727 (1996) (listing and\r\napplying requirements for plain view doctrine).  This applies to items\r\nviewed during a warranted search.  Thus, when law enforcement is\r\nconducting a search pursuant to a warrant, police are authorized to seize\r\nobjects not listed in the warrant as long as the object is viewed from a lawful\r\nvantage point, the incriminating nature of the object is obvious, and it may be\r\nseized from a lawful right of access.  <u>Horton v.

United States</u>, 318 U.S. 332,\r\n340 (1943).  This supervisory power does not, however, go so far as to\r\nallow a judicial officer to alter what legal principles will or will not apply\r\nin a particular case.  This proposition was established in <u>United\r\nStates v. Payner</u>, 447 U.S. 727 (1980), in which the trial court attempted\r\nto use its supervisory authority to suppress items seized in violation of a\r\nthird party’s constitutional rights, thereby avoiding the established rules for\r\nFourth Amendment standing.  In reversing, the Supreme Court concluded\r\nthat, if it accepted such use of the supervisory power, it “would confer on the\r\njudiciary discretionary power to disregard the considered limitations of the\r\nlaw it is charged with enforcing.”  <u>Id</u>. at 737.  In this case,\r\nallowing instruction (1) would confer on a judicial officer the authority to\r\npick and choose what legal doctrines would apply to a particular police\r\nsearch.  Because we do not believe that a judicial officer holds such\r\nauthority, we conclude that the State’s petition for extraordinary relief must\r\nbe granted with regard to instruction (1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\" align=\"center\">B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 39.<span>        \r\n</span>Next, we turn to instructions (2), (3), and (4) requiring that the\r\nsearch be performed by third parties or trained computer personnel separate from\r\nthe investigators and operating behind a firewall.  The principal\r\ninstruction on this topic reads in full:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">  Inspection and investigation of\r\nthe subject computer must be done by either an independent third party or\r\nspecially trained computer personnel who are not involved in the investigation\r\nwhile staying behind a firewall, that is, in the absence of other agents of the\r\nState, and subject to a ban on copying or communicating to any person or the\r\nState any information found on the subject computer other than digital evidence\r\nrelating to identity theft offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">Further, the court directed that\r\nif segregated state investigators were used, they could not disclose\r\ninformation other than that related to the “identity theft offenses.”  If\r\nprivate third parties were employed, the court required them to deliver only\r\n“digital evidence relating to the offenses being investigated” and to segregate\r\nand redact it from non-evidentiary data “no matter how intermingled.” \r\nThese instructions are the heart of the court’s ex ante order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 40.<span>        \r\n</span>Again, the State contends that the judicial officer had no authority to\r\nimpose these instructions because it was an attempt to dictate <u>how</u> law\r\nenforcement should reasonably conduct the search.  See Kerr, <u>supra</u>,\r\nat 1277.  The ACLU argues that the separation and screening instructions\r\nare necessary to protect privacy by ensuring that investigations have\r\nindependent sources and that police objectives do not become comingled. \r\nThe Defender General contends that the segregation procedures protect privacy\r\nby providing “the mechanism to ensure that the State would not gain access to\r\ndata that it had no probable cause to collect.”  The Defender General also\r\nargues that the standard under the Vermont Constitution is more stringent than\r\nits federal counterpart because Article 11 requires that a search be conducted\r\n“in the least intrusive manner.”  <u>State v. Birchard</u>, 2010 VT 57, ¶\r\n13, 188 Vt. 172, 5 A.3d 879.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 41.<span>        \r\n</span>The application for the warrant in this case requested incredibly broad\r\nauthorization.  The affidavit in support of the search warrant application\r\nsays that in some cases searching for evidence relevant to the charged crime\r\ncan involve “carefully targeted searches that can locate evidence without\r\nrequiring a time-consuming manual search through unrelated materials.”  It\r\ngoes on to say, however, that in other cases these techniques will not yield\r\nall the relevant evidence because “[c]riminals can mislabel or hide files and\r\ndirectories, encode communications to avoid using key words, attempt to delete\r\nfiles to evade detection, or take other steps designed to frustrate law\r\nenforcement searches for information.”  The affidavit asserts that the\r\ncriminal’s steps “may require agents and law enforcement or other analysts with\r\nappropriate expertise to conduct more extensive searches, such as scanning\r\nareas of the disk not allocated to listed files, or peruse every file briefly\r\nto determine whether it falls within the scope of the warrant.”  The\r\naffidavit also states that because electronic data can easily be moved to other\r\ncomputers within the house, law enforcement must search all computers, even\r\nthose belonging to persons not suspected of committing a crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 42.<span>        \r\n</span>In short, the warrant application could not have requested a broader\r\nauthorization:  that is, to search all files in all ways on all computers\r\nin the house.  See P. Ohm, Response, <u>Massive Hard Drives, General\r\nWarrants, and the Power of Magistrate Judges</u>, 97 Va. L. Rev. In Brief 1, 11\r\n(2011) (“Computer search warrants are the closest things to general warrants we\r\nhave confronted in the history of the Republic.”).  Understandably, in the\r\njudicial officer’s view, the warrant application did not provide probable cause\r\nfor such a wide ranging search.  See <u>United States v. Otero</u>, 563\r\nF.3d 1127, 1132 (10th Cir. 2009) (“The modern development of the personal\r\ncomputer and its ability to store and intermingle a huge array of one’s\r\npersonal papers in a single place increases law enforcement’s ability to\r\nconduct a wide-ranging search into a person’s private affairs, and accordingly\r\nmakes the particularity requirement that much more important.”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 43.<span>        \r\n</span>The separation and screening instructions are the judicial officer’s\r\nattempt to remedy this lack of particularity.  To accomplish this, the\r\ninstructions require that only the particular information for which there is\r\nprobable cause to search will be laid bare to police investigators.  See <u>Marron\r\nv. United States</u>, 275 U.S. 192, 196 (1927) (“The requirement that warrants\r\nshall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches\r\nunder them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant\r\ndescribing another.”).  As opposed to exposing the entire contents of the\r\nhard drive to the police, the procedures ensure that only those files that\r\nrelate to the suspected criminal activity will be viewed.  In lieu of a\r\nparticular description of the relevant files, the conditions create a procedure\r\nfor identifying the relevant files and exposing only them to police investigators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 44.<span>        \r\n</span>The State and the dissent raise two general objections to the\r\ninstructions.  The first, particularly raised by the dissent, is that the\r\ninstructions have improperly eviscerated the plain view doctrine.  <u>Post</u>,\r\n¶ 84.  Although the practical consequences of the instructions may be\r\ncomparable to an abrogation of the plain view doctrine, the mechanism is\r\ncritically different.  Abrogating the plain view doctrine would mean that\r\ninvestigating police officers could not seize evidence that they incidentally\r\nviewed.  The screening procedures, in contrast, prevent such incidental\r\npolice viewings from ever occurring.  It is not an abrogation of the plain\r\nview doctrine to put in place safeguards against the police plainly viewing.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[19]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  By separating police investigators\r\nand third-party screeners, these instructions—almost by definition—ensure a\r\nparticularity of the exposure to police while avoiding the abrogation of the\r\nplain view doctrine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 45.<span>        \r\n</span>In making their argument, the dissent is treating the plain view\r\ndoctrine as some form of right of law enforcement officials.  The dissent\r\nrefers to “frustrat[ing]” and “interfer[ing] with” the plain view\r\ndoctrine.  <u>Post</u>, ¶¶ 84, 100.  In fact, the plain view doctrine\r\nhas a very limited role in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  It is related\r\nonly to seizures, not to searches.  <u>Horton</u>, 496 U.S. at 134\r\n(stating that plain view is an “exception that is addressed to the concerns\r\nthat are implicated by seizures rather than by searches”).  The doctrine\r\nitself is concerned with the permissible actions of the investigator after he\r\nor she has seen the incriminating evidence, not before.  As we said in <u>State\r\nv. Birchard</u>, the “plain-view doctrine comes into play as an exception only\r\nwhere an officer <u>has</u> observed the object in question.”  2010 VT 57,\r\n¶ 27, 188 Vt. 172, 5 A.3d 879.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 46.<span>        \r\n</span>An examination of the U.S. Supreme Court cases that developed the\r\ndoctrine make it clear that it was crafted to be a narrow exception to the\r\nwarrant requirement, permissible only as a convenience.  The primary\r\ndevelopment of the doctrine was in the plurality opinion in <u>Coolidge v. New\r\nHampshire</u>, which made the practical rational underlying the doctrine clear:\r\n“Where, once an otherwise lawful search is in progress, the police\r\ninadvertently come upon a piece of evidence, it would often be a <u>needless\r\ninconvenience</u>, and sometimes dangerous—to the evidence or to the police\r\nthemselves—to require them to ignore it until they have obtained a warrant\r\nparticularly describing it.”  403 U.S. 443, 467-68 (1971) (emphasis\r\nadded).  The opinion noted the reasons for the warrant requirement and\r\nstated, in part, that allowing the seizure of evidence in plain view without a\r\nwarrant would not interfere with a primary rationale for the warrant\r\nrequirement that “those searches deemed necessary should be as limited as\r\npossible.”  <u>Id</u>. at 467.  It would not do so, the Court found,\r\nbecause the plain view doctrine “does not convert the search into a general or\r\nexploratory one.”<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[20]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\n<u>Id</u>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 47.<span>        \r\n</span>Having established the compatibility of the plain view doctrine and the\r\nconstitutional principles at stake, the plurality found the exception\r\nacceptable: “As against the minor peril to Fourth Amendment protections, there\r\nis a major gain in effective law enforcement.”  <u>Id</u>.  Later\r\ncases have recognized the same rationale.  See <u>Dickerson</u>, 508 U.S.\r\nat 375 (“The warrantless seizure of contraband [that officers see in plain view\r\nduring a valid search] is deemed justified by the realization that resort to a\r\nneutral magistrate under such circumstances would often be impracticable and\r\nwould do little to promote the objectives of the Fourth Amendment.”).  We\r\nhave explained the plain view doctrine as an “exception to the warrant\r\nrequirement.”  <u>Trudeau</u>, 165 Vt. at 358, 683 A.2d at 727.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 48.<span>        \r\n</span>It is difficult to imagine how we could frustrate a doctrine based on\r\nconvenience to establish an exception to the warrant requirement.  The\r\nrationale has nothing to do with a law enforcement officer’s access to\r\nevidence; it determines only whether the officer must obtain a warrant to seize\r\nevidence to which the officer has access. Thus, we cannot accept the argument\r\nthat the instructions impermissibly abrogate the plain view doctrine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 49.<span>        \r\n</span>Second, the State and the dissent argue that allowing the information to\r\nbe viewed by any third party—even one behind a firewall so the information\r\ncannot be viewed by a law enforcement officer—eliminate any legitimate privacy\r\ninterest.  <u>Post</u>, ¶ 90.  Put another way, the issue, is whether\r\nthe conditions meaningfully advance privacy interests in a way that would\r\njustify their imposition on the State.  Superficially, the answer is not\r\nobvious because a citizen’s private information is being exposed one way or\r\nanother, be it to a police officer or a third-party analyst.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[21]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  The police investigators see only\r\nthe particular files relevant to the investigated crimes, but other files will\r\ninevitably be viewed by the screener.  If the information exposure is the\r\nsame either way, one might argue that these instructions ultimately offer no\r\nreal protection.  See <u>Douglas v.

United States</u>, 333 U.S.\r\n10, 13-14 (1948) (“The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not\r\ngrasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support\r\nof the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence.  Its\r\nprotection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral\r\nand detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the\r\noften competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 55.<span>        \r\n</span>The recognition that exposure to a disinterested third party may be\r\nsubstantially less injurious than exposure to an interested party explains why\r\nwe often rely upon third-party screening in other contexts.  For example,\r\nthird-party filtering or screening teams are frequently used to protect against\r\nthe disclosure of privileged documents.  See, e.g., <u>Hicks v.

Kerr, <u>Searches and Seizures in a\r\nDigital World</u>, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 531, 533 (2005) (“Computers are like containers in a physical sense, homes in a virtual\r\nsense, and vast warehouses in an informational sense.”).  Without caution,\r\nsearches of computers threaten to authorize police culling through more\r\npersonal information than has ever been possible before.  See R. Winick, <u>Searches\r\nand Seizures of Computers and Computer Data</u>, 8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 75,\r\n78 (Fall 1994) (“[T]he massive storage capacity of modern computers creates a\r\nhigh risk of overbroad, wide-ranging searches and seizures.”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 59.<span>        \r\n</span>Because modern computers contain a plethora of private information,\r\nexposing them to wholesale searches presents a special threat of exposing\r\nirrelevant but damaging secrets.  Judge Kleinfeld of the Ninth Circuit\r\nputs the point vividly: </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\"> \r\nThere are just too many secrets on people’s computers, most legal, some\r\nembarrassing, and some potentially tragic in their implications, for loose\r\nliberality in allowing search warrants.  Emails and history links may show\r\nthat someone is ordering medication for a disease being kept secret even from\r\nfamily members.  Or they may show that someone’s child is being counseled\r\nby parents for a serious problem that is none of anyone else’s business.\r\n Or a married mother of three may be carrying on a steamy email\r\ncorrespondence with an old high school boyfriend.  Or an otherwise\r\nrespectable, middle-aged gentleman may be looking at dirty pictures.  Just\r\nas a conscientious public official may be hounded out of office because a party\r\nguest found a homosexual magazine when she went to the bathroom at his house,\r\npeople’s lives may be ruined because of legal but embarrassing materials found\r\non their computers.  And, in all but the largest metropolitan areas, it\r\nreally does not matter whether any formal charges ensue—if the police or other\r\nvisitors find the material, it will be all over town and hinted at in the\r\nnewspaper within a few days. . . .  Sex with children is so\r\ndisgusting to most of us that we may be too liberal in allowing searches when\r\nthe government investigates child pornography cases.  The privacy of\r\npeople’s computers is too important to let it be eroded by sexual disgust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\"><u>United\r\nStates v. Gourde</u>, 440 F.3d 1065, 1077-78 (9th Cir. 2006) (Kleinfeld, J.,\r\ndissenting).  These possibilities do not mean that computers cannot be searched. \r\nBut given the multiplicity and magnitude of the unanticipated injuries that\r\nmight be inflicted by allowing exposure of an entire computer hard drive, it is\r\nunderstandable to seek precautions that might mitigate such injuries.  And\r\ngiven that exposure of embarrassing information to a detached third party\r\nconstitutes a lesser injury, we conclude that the use of third-party screeners\r\nis not so wholly without basis as to constitute an abuse of the judge’s\r\ndiscretion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 60.<span>        \r\n</span>The State raises practical objections to these requirements.\r\n First, the State argues that ex ante instructions will have no practical\r\neffect because the reasonableness of any search will be determined ex post, in\r\nresponse to a motion to suppress, and as a result the instructions “cannot be\r\nenforced.”  The whole point of instructions (2), (3), and (4) is to deny\r\nthe State access to information outside the justification for the warrant and\r\nthus avoid disputes over whether such information can be used in a criminal\r\ncase or otherwise.  As we noted at the outset of this opinion, “It is\r\nsettled law that the search and seizure of evidence, conducted under a warrant,\r\nmust conform to the requirements of that warrant.”  <u>United States v.\r\nBrunette</u>, 76 F. Supp. 2d 30, 42 (D. Me. 1999).  The decision in <u>Richards\r\nv. Wisconsin</u>, upon which the State relies, stands only for the proposition\r\nthat suppression might not be required where the noncompliance is based on an\r\nunanticipated circumstance, too urgent in nature for the warrant to be amended. \r\n520 U.S. at 395-96 (accepting police decision not to knock and announce after\r\nalready having had door slammed in their face by suspect upon seeing uniformed\r\nindividual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 61.<span>        \r\n</span>We agree with the State that ex post review will always remain open, but\r\nthis does not mean that the ex ante instructions are without legal\r\nsignificance.  Indeed, our holding today is that there is no\r\nconstitutional distinction between instructions on how a search will be\r\nconducted and other instructions that, for example, relate to when the search\r\nmust occur.  See V.R.Cr.P. 41(c) (warrant shall “command the officer to\r\nsearch within a specified period of time not to exceed 10 days”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 62.<span>        \r\n</span>Second, the State argues that the requirement to use a non-investigator\r\nto conduct the search “without the presence or input of the investigator may\r\nresult in relevant evidence being missed.”  In responding to this\r\nargument, we note that the State chooses the person(s) conducting the search\r\nand can ensure that the person(s) have the skill to recognize relevant\r\nevidence.  Further, the concept of a firewall does not preclude the State\r\nfrom educating the person(s) conducting the search in the nature alleged\r\ncrimes, as long as the person(s) conducting the search do not share extraneous\r\ninformation with the State investigator.  We do not conclude that there is\r\na practical defect in the condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 63.<span>        \r\n</span>Third, the State argues that the segregation requirement will prevent a\r\ndynamic investigation in which the search can be expanded based upon what\r\ninformation is uncovered.  Again, we find that the State overstates the\r\nobjection.  Nothing in instruction 5 states that on receipt of information\r\nfrom the search, the criminal investigator cannot ask for additional searching\r\nspecifying the relevance of additional evidence in light of what evidence was\r\nproduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 64.<span>        \r\n</span>We therefore deny the request for extraordinary relief with regard to\r\ninstructions (2), (3), and (4).  This result is based largely on the broad\r\nauthorization sought by the applicant law enforcement officer and the affidavit\r\nsupporting that application.  The judicial officer concluded that\r\nresorting to a neutral third-party screener may be the only way to provide\r\nmeaningful privacy protections in the face of broad law enforcement requests\r\nlike this one.  See <u>CDT I</u>, 579 F.3d at 1007 (“In the end\r\n. . . we must rely on the good sense and vigilance of our magistrate\r\njudges, who are in the front line of preserving the constitutional freedoms of\r\nour citizens while assisting the government in its legitimate efforts to\r\nprosecute criminal activity.  Nothing we could say would substitute for\r\nthe sound judgment that judicial officers must exercise in striking this\r\ndelicate balance.”).  We hold that such an order does protect a legitimate\r\nprivacy interest and did not constitute a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\" align=\"center\">C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 65.<span>        \r\n</span>Next, we turn to the instructions limiting the search techniques that\r\npolice can employ and prohibiting the use of sophisticated searching software\r\nwithout prior court authorization.  The judge directed police to use a\r\nsearch protocol “designed to uncover only the information for which the State\r\nhas probable cause” by focusing on documents limited by: the time period\r\nrelevant to the alleged criminal activity, key words, and specific file\r\ntypes.  The judge also precluded use of sophisticated search techniques\r\nwithout prior authorization.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[23]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 66.<span>        \r\n</span>Under the order, these instructions are imposed on the persons(s) who\r\nconduct the search under instruction (2) and were within the court’s power to\r\nensure satisfaction of the probable cause and particularity requirements of the\r\nFourth Amendment and Article 11.  As noted, the warrant application sought\r\nto examine every file on every type of electronic media found at the location\r\nlisted in the warrant, regardless of ownership.  In the judicial officer’s\r\nview, this application did not provide probable cause for such a broad search\r\nwithout some further specification of the particular places to be searched and\r\nthe particular items to be seized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 67.<span>        \r\n</span>As we have already discussed, especially in a non-physical context,\r\nparticularity may be achieved through specification of how a search will be\r\nconducted.  The purpose of the particularity requirement is to prevent\r\ngeneral searches.  <u>Maryland v. Garrison</u>, 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987).\r\n By limiting the authorization to specific areas and specific things, the\r\nparticularity requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to\r\nits justifications and will not become a wide-ranging, exploratory search that\r\nthe Fourth Amendment prohibits.  See <u>United States v. Carey</u>, 172\r\nF.3d 1268, 1271-72 (10th Cir. 1999) (“The Fourth Amendment requires that a\r\nsearch warrant describe the things to be seized with sufficient particularity\r\nto prevent a general exploratory rummaging in a person’s belongings.”). \r\nParticularity is measured in practical terms.  <u>United States v. Johnson</u>,\r\n541 F.2d 1311, 1313 (8th Cir. 1976) (per curiam) (explaining that standard to\r\ndetermine whether warrant describes place to be searched with sufficient\r\naccuracy “is one of practical accuracy rather than technical nicety”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 68.<span>        \r\n</span>The warrant application here asserted the need for a broad,\r\nunconstrained search based on the investigating officer’s general contention\r\nthat criminals often hide incriminating evidence by using non-identifying\r\ntitles, changing file extensions, and encryption or password protection. \r\nThere was no information presented, however, that there was reason to believe\r\nthe suspect in this case had used such techniques or even that those engaged in\r\nidentity theft typically do so.  Cf. <u>Wolf v. State</u>, 266 P.3d 1169,\r\n1173-74 (Idaho Ct. App. 2011) (concluding there was sufficient probable cause\r\nto search computer hardware, software and electronic devices where affidavit\r\nexplained officer’s experience in area of child exploitation and storage of\r\nchild pornography on computers).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 69.<span>        \r\n</span>The application suggests, if not admits, that the broadest scope of search\r\nmay not be necessary.  The affidavit explains that in some cases, the\r\nsought-after information can be found through targeted searches not requiring\r\nsuch exhaustive measures.  Further, there was no attempt to limit the\r\nsearch based on the known details of the suspected crime such as the\r\ntime-period, the victim, or the institutions involved in the suspected identity\r\ntheft.  See <u>Otero</u>, 563 F.3d at 1132-33 (concluding that warrant\r\napplication to search computer failed to satisfy particularity required where\r\nsearch was not limited by date and crimes suspected); <u>United States v.\r\nClough</u>, 246 F. Supp. 2d 84, 87 (D. Me. 2003) (holding warrant failed to\r\nmeet particularity requirement where it contained “no restrictions on the\r\nsearch, no references to statutes, and no references to crimes or\r\nillegality”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 70.<span>        \r\n</span>Given that narrowing the search could still accomplish recovery of the\r\nincriminating evidence which there was probable cause to believe would be found\r\nwithin the digital equipment seized, the court was within its discretion to\r\nreduce preliminarily the scope of the warrant.  The judicial officer did\r\nnot abuse his power by restricting law enforcement’s search to those items that\r\nmet certain parameters based on dates, types of files, or the author of a document. \r\nSee <u>United States v. Rude</u>, 88 F.3d 1538, 1551 (1996) (concluding that\r\n“the specification of dates, individuals, and the [particular] corporation,\r\nalong with a reasonably precise delineation of the type of records sought,\r\nsatisfied the specificity requirement”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 71.<span>        \r\n</span>This was especially appropriate where the State proposed no limiting\r\ninstructions of its own.  The State fails to demonstrate that such limits\r\nwere overly particular or otherwise untenable.  In fact, such limits are\r\nessential to meet the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment,\r\nespecially in cases involving record searches where nonresponsive information\r\nis intermingled with relevant evidence.  <u>Hunter</u>, 13 F. Supp. 2d at\r\n582-83 (concluding that particularity requirement was satisfied where records\r\nto be seized were identified “by time period and by the individual, entity, or\r\nproperty involved”); <u>Commonwealth v. McDermott</u>, 864 N.E.2d 471, 487\r\n(Mass. 2007) (concluding that warrant was sufficiently particular where category\r\nlimited by time frame and nature of items to be seized).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 72.<span>        \r\n</span>We recognize that instructions 5 and 6 are less necessary when the\r\nsearch is conducted by persons segregated behind a firewall from State\r\ninvestigators.  Nevertheless, they can be an additional safeguard to\r\nguarantee that the search conducted by the segregated persons is not too\r\nbroad.  Indeed, the State in its brief recognized such a need when it\r\nobserved that “the forensic examiner is as likely or unlikely to conduct an\r\nillegal general search of the computer as the investigator.”  We conclude\r\nthat their imposition was within the judicial officer’s discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 73.<span>        \r\n</span>Again, the State raises a practical objection that the judicial officer will\r\nnot have the expertise to review search protocols under instruction (6) and\r\nthat limitations on search protocols are unworkable because of the dynamic\r\nnature of a search.  All the instruction calls for is that the persons\r\nconducting the search, prior to using hash protocols or similar search tools,\r\neducate the judicial officer on the need for these methods and obtain\r\napproval.  Just as a judicial officer is expected to expeditiously respond\r\nto a search warrant request, we can expect timely response to a request to\r\nemploy special search protocols.  We also believe that the judicial\r\nofficer can be educated on the purpose and method of any search tool, such as\r\nto responsibly exercise the oversight responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 74.<span>        \r\n</span>Absent grounds to conclude that a judicial officer acted arbitrarily, we\r\nwill not second-guess the judicial officer’s discretionary judgment in the\r\ncontext of a motion for extraordinary relief.  See <u>Richardson v. City\r\nof Rutland</u>, 164 Vt. 422, 424, 671 A.2d 1245, 1247 (1995) (explaining that\r\nextraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus is a limited remedy to correct\r\n“an arbitrary abuse of . . . power” (quoting <u>Couture v.\r\nSelectmen of Berkshire</u>, 121 Vt. 359, 361, 159 A.2d 78, 80 (1960))). \r\nThe State is not persuasive in its claims that the limits will unduly hamper\r\ndetection of crime.  The equipment is seized and secured in the State’s\r\npossession.  After exhausting its search options as permitted by the\r\nconditions of particularity, nothing precludes the State from seeking a new\r\nwarrant to employ more sophisticated search techniques or a more probing\r\nanalysis of the electronic media based on the results—or frustration—of their\r\ninitial search, providing probable cause remains.  The State’s request for\r\nextraordinary relief from these instructions is therefore denied.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 75.<span>        \r\n</span>Finally, we address those instructions pertaining to the copying,\r\nreturn, and destruction of property.  The judicial officer set\r\ninstructions requiring that: (1) only responsive information could be copied;\r\n(2) non-responsive data should be returned and the court informed; (3) copies\r\nmust be destroyed absent judicial authorization otherwise; and (4) the return\r\nshould specify the information seized, returned, and destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 76.<span>        \r\n</span>These instructions would hardly seem novel if imposed on law enforcement\r\nat the initial search phase.  It goes without saying that law enforcement\r\nofficers are empowered to seize and copy only items that are responsive to a\r\nwarrant and, in turn, to inventory the items seized and return this list to the\r\ncourt.  Indeed, under the Rules of Criminal Procedure, law enforcement\r\nofficers conducting a search are required to give the person from whom property\r\nis taken “a receipt.”  V.R.Cr.P. 41(d).  The officer must also make\r\nand file with the court a return, including a written inventory of the property\r\ntaken.  <u>Id</u>.  The rule allows a grieved individual to move for\r\nreturn of property seized illegally.  V.R.Cr.P. 41(e).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 77.<span>        \r\n</span>In this case, the unique aspect of these instructions arises because the\r\nwarrant authorized law enforcement to seize electronic medium to be searched\r\noff-site.  As we noted initially, we are really dealing with two searches\r\nhere.  Apparently, the judicial officer wished to emphasize that although\r\nthe State was authorized to search off-site, this did not provide authority for\r\nthe State to retain indefinitely all electronic data and law enforcement was\r\nstill required to return or destroy nonresponsive data as well as to notify the\r\ncourt of the items retained and returned.  Given that the judicial\r\nofficer’s instructions essentially echo the requirements of Rule 41, we\r\nconclude that it was within the officer’s power to impose them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 78.<span>        \r\n</span>In reaching our conclusion, we do not conclude that instruction (7) or\r\n(8) prevents the segregated search persons from imaging the computer hard drive\r\nand other electronic storage media so that the computer and media can be\r\nreturned to its owner.  That procedure gives the State full search\r\ncapacity while minimizing the interference with the activities of the computer\r\nowner.  It was used in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 79.<span>        \r\n</span>Instruction (7) prohibits giving copies of extraneous information to\r\nState investigation agents.  It does not prohibit the persons conducting\r\nthe search from making copies or images for their own use as long as they are\r\ndestroyed, as provided in instruction (9).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 80.<span>        \r\n</span>Nor do we read instruction (9) as prohibiting the maintenance of\r\nevidence for appeals, post-conviction relief and civil liability, as the State\r\nclaims.  In circumstances where the State can show that digital\r\ninformation should be kept for a specific reason—for example, for an appeal of\r\na dispute over the validity of or compliance with ex ante instructions—the\r\ninstruction authorizes the State to seek a judicial authorization to delay\r\ndestruction.  Otherwise, the overall procedure leaves a sufficient record\r\nfor future proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 81.<span>        \r\n</span>Finally, we reject the State’s argument that instruction (10) imposes an\r\narbitrary time limit on the search, even though the search may take a long,\r\nindeterminate time to finish.  Although instruction (10) authorizes the\r\njudicial officer to impose a time limit in the warrant on completing the search\r\nand filing a return, the warrant itself imposes no time limit and authorizes\r\nthe analysis be conducted “as long as reasonably necessary.”  Under these\r\ncircumstances, the State’s argument is premature.  In any event, we\r\nreiterate that there are two searches here and just as the applicable criminal\r\nrule can impose a time limit on the initial search of the dwelling, see\r\nV.R.Cr.P. 41(c), the magistrate can impose a time limit on the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 82.<span>        \r\n</span>In sum, we conclude that the judicial officer did not contravene his\r\npower in imposing instructions concerning the manner of the law enforcement’s\r\nsearch of the computer to satisfy the probable cause and particularity demands\r\nof the warrant requirement.  However, we hold there was no authority to\r\npreclude law enforcement’s seizure of items in plain view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u>The petition for extraordinary\r\nrelief is granted in part, and condition (1) is stricken from the\r\nwarrant.  In

recommendations and adhere to\r\nthe plain view doctrine approved under the Fourth Amendment. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 89.<span>        \r\n</span>It bears noting that the majority holding is not, like the suppression\r\nof illegally obtained evidence, fashioned to vindicate a constitutional right. \r\nThe underlying search warrant is entirely lawful without the majority’s gag\r\ncondition and segregated searchers, and presents no violation of any privacy\r\nright guaranteed against unreasonable search and seizure.  No one\r\ncomplains that the warrant is insufficiently particular.  The majority\r\nagrees there is no constitutional limitation on observing evidence of other\r\ncrimes in plain view during a valid search.  The majority can point to no\r\ninfraction of the Fourth Amendment, actual or threatened, to justify its ex\r\nante limits on plain view.  Given that the warrant application is\r\notherwise valid, the majority’s holding provides little instruction to the\r\ntrial bench on when and how to apply such segregated searches in the future\r\nsince no constitutional right requires application of this extraordinary\r\nmeasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 90.<span>        \r\n</span>Further, whatever computer privacy the majority supposes to protect will\r\nbe already and completely compromised by the warrant and the search, even when\r\nexecuted by the majority’s gagged search team.  Whether viewed by the case\r\ninvestigator or segregated police, or some other police agent, the\r\ncourt-ordered privacy invasion is the same.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[26]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  These conditions mean that just as\r\nmuch private information will be exposed to the view of government\r\nstrangers.  As acknowledged and argued by amicus ACLU, “the harm to\r\nprivacy interests is complete when the protected material is viewed.”  In\r\nreal life, requiring that a search be executed by one police agent versus\r\nanother results in no actual limit on the search and, so, no actual protection\r\nof privacy.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 91.<span>        \r\n</span>The majority’s segregated screening conditions result in no less of a\r\nsearch, no less intrusion into the computer’s files, and no less potential for observing\r\nother incriminating evidence in plain view of the searchers.  Thus,\r\nrequiring a search by different, segregated and muted investigators serves no\r\nFourth Amendment privacy interest whatsoever.  Protecting no actual\r\nprivacy, the majority simply conjures up immunity for computer owners whose\r\ndata includes proof of other crimes in plain view during a valid search. \r\nAt the same time, such immunity does not exist for property holders whose\r\nhomes, bedrooms, closets, file cabinets, files, and purses are lawfully\r\nsearched—because the constitution does not require it.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 92.<span>        \r\n</span>Nor does the constitution require such immunity for computer\r\ncontent.  If the issuing court was concerned about lack of probable cause\r\nor particularity as the majority asserts, <u>ante</u>, ¶ 43, then the\r\ncourt was free to deny the warrant application or limit the search\r\naccordingly.  Neither probable cause nor the application’s particularity\r\nis challenged here.  The majority’s endorsement of the\r\nsilenced-and-segregated-search-team condition succeeds in defeating actual\r\nplain view, but utterly fails to increase particularity or narrow the scope of\r\nthe search.  As noted above, the search—the actual invasion of privacy\r\napplied for by the State and authorized by the warrant—is exactly the same,\r\nwhether conducted by investigators assigned to the case, or by the judicially\r\ngagged investigators preferred by the majority. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 93.<span>        \r\n</span>Patently incorrect is the majority’s assertion that investigators will\r\nnever view incriminating evidence unrelated to identity theft offenses. \r\nThe majority imagines that ordering the search be conducted by police\r\ninvestigators not assigned to <u>this</u> investigation somehow “obviate[s],”\r\nor prevents, plain view from occurring.  <u>Ante</u>, ¶ 37.  If this\r\nwere true, there would be no need for the gag order.  But since it is\r\nclear that plain view of other incriminating evidence by the other police\r\nsearch team can still occur, the supposed prevention can only result from the\r\ngag order that prevents its disclosure.  Thus, declares the majority,\r\ngagging the search team is “not an abrogation of the plain view doctrine,” but\r\na safeguard “against the police plainly viewing.”  <u>Ante</u>,\r\n¶ 44.  All winking aside, the search is still authorized by the\r\nwarrant, privacy is still invaded by government search agents, and any other\r\nevidence in plain view is still seen.  The old saying about being “just a\r\nlittle bit pregnant” comes to mind.  That adage, of course—like pretending\r\na search is not a search, and that evidence in plain view is not seen or even\r\ndoes not exist—is a fallacy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 94.<span>        \r\n</span>There is not cited a single Fourth Amendment case to support the\r\nmajority’s sabotage of the plain view doctrine.  This is because the\r\nFourth Amendment expressly proscribes unreasonable searches, and it is\r\nundisputed that a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause\r\nand approved by a magistrate is not unreasonable.  It is equally settled\r\nthat where a magistrate authorizes a valid search under the Fourth Amendment,\r\nthere is no constitutionally protected privacy against such an intrusion.\r\nCertainly most people prefer that police not enter their homes or computers to\r\nsearch, but if a warrant issues then the proprietor is without right to\r\nresist.  See <u>Gasho v. United States</u>, 39 F.3d 1420, 1432 n.12 (9th\r\nCir. 1994) (recognizing that “a citizen has no right to resist a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant”). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 95.<span>        \r\n</span>The majority’s notion, to limit judicial warrants according to what\r\nboils down to an aversion to police viewing or disclosing evidence of what\r\ncould be our criminal misconduct—in other words, to have criminals set the\r\nstandard—is patently unworkable and is not the law.  Once a warrant\r\nvalidly issues, it is irrelevant whether the target likes the police, wants to\r\ndisclose information to the police, or would choose someone else to conduct the\r\nsearch.  It has never been held otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 96.<span>        \r\n</span>Finding no support in the law of search and seizure, the majority seeks\r\na rationale from rulings in civil litigation over unauthorized exposures of\r\nprivate information.  The majority’s distinctions between different\r\ndisclosures and degrees of embarrassment make for an interesting exploration of\r\nthe multi-faceted nature of privacy and our varied reactions to having secrets\r\nrevealed to some people as opposed to others, <u>ante</u>, ¶¶ 50-53, but the\r\nFourth Amendment is all about <u>searches</u> and not about disclosure. \r\nTruisms about the need to protect citizens from state intrusion are exactly why\r\nthe constitution limits the government’s authority to search us and our\r\nbelongings.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 97.<span>        \r\n</span>The Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable search and\r\nseizure does not turn on some sliding scale of privacy or potential\r\nembarrassment.  All of our private spaces, regardless of perceived or\r\nrelative importance, are protected to the same degree: the government may not\r\nobtain a search warrant except upon probable cause and with\r\nparticularity.  See <u>New Jersey v. T.L.O.</u>, 469 U.S. 325, 335-39\r\n(1985) (explaining that the Fourth Amendment does not compare privacies, but\r\nprotects against “arbitrary invasions by government officials,” be they police\r\nor civilian authorities, whether searching children, adults or any of their\r\nclosed containers).  Which police agent conducts the search is generally\r\nirrelevant to whether the search is reasonable.  <u>Id</u>. at 335\r\n(applying the constitutional strictures not only to police searches, but to\r\ninspections by any “sovereign authority”).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[27]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  The constitutional point is not\r\nwho gets to share evidence discovered in a legal search, but whether the\r\ngovernment can search at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 98.<span>        \r\n</span>In this case, the constitutional question was answered when the\r\nmagistrate issued the warrant on what the parties do not dispute was probable\r\ncause.  Appropriate restrictions on the search itself were imposed by the\r\nissuing court to ensure particularity and to avoid an unfettered search as\r\ncommanded by the Fourth Amendment.  Ex ante conditions (5) and (6) limited\r\npolice to methods likely to find only the evidence specifically sought, and\r\nprohibited escalation of the search with more sophisticated tools without prior\r\njudicial approval.  In contrast, the conditions imposing a segregated,\r\nsilenced or blinkered search team and no sharing of evidence in plain view adds\r\nno particularity, limits no search, serves no privacy and the majority cannot\r\nshow us where it is called for by the constitution.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[28]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 99.<span>        \r\n</span>Assuming that searching a computer can challenge traditional notions of\r\nprivacy,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[29]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nthe challenge is missing in this case.  What the State seeks to look for,\r\nand where, seems hardly different from a search for files in a cabinet, papers in\r\na desk, drafts in a checking account or letters in a box.  To the extent\r\nthat depth or volume of data is the issue, if the necessary probable cause is\r\nmade out, a warrant can issue to find a needle in a haystack or a needle in a\r\nhouse or office.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 100.<span>    \r\n</span>Moreover, given no dispute that the State may seize incriminating\r\nevidence noticed in plain view during an otherwise valid search, those\r\nrestrictions are a bald interference by the judiciary in the legal execution of\r\na warrant by the executive branch.  The majority can refer to no case or\r\nrule authorizing the court to command blindness or feigned ignorance to a\r\nconstitutionally authorized plain view of criminal evidence.  Eliminating\r\nplain view ad hoc in a particular search through the ex ante artifice of a\r\nseparate and gagged search team achieves exactly what the majority acknowledges\r\nis improper, <u>ante</u>, ¶ 38: leaving the magistrate “to disregard the\r\nconsidered limitations of the law” (like the court’s lack of authority to\r\nproscribe plain view), and conferring “on a judicial officer the authority to\r\npick and choose what legal doctrines would apply to a particular police search”\r\n(as in commanding police to ignore evidence in plain view in a computer search,\r\nwhile allowing plain view discovery in a house or office search).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 101.<span>    \r\n</span>The separation and screening condoned by the majority does not protect\r\nactual privilege or privacy, does not further a Fourth Amendment privacy\r\ninterest, and does not lend further particularity to the search.  The sole\r\npurpose of the segregation and gag order is to discard the plain view\r\ndoctrine—something the majority already agrees is beyond the issuing court’s\r\nauthority.  I must dissent, and am authorized to state that Chief Justice\r\nReiber joins this concurrence and dissent.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"

rather, it noted that multiple people were\r\nliving in the target address and requested permission to seize electronic\r\ndevices regardless of ownership.  As justification, the affidavit explained\r\nthat electronic information may be easily moved between different computers and\r\nother electronic storage devices.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 6.<span>            \r\n</span>Reciting general information about the large volume of information\r\nstored on a computer, the technical expertise required to search data that can\r\nbe hidden, password protected, or encrypted, and the time involved in such a\r\nsearch, the application requested authorization to seize any computers for\r\nsearch off-site.  The application further stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In some cases, it is possible for law\r\nenforcement officers and forensic examiners to conduct carefully targeted\r\nsearches that can locate evidence without requiring a time-consuming manual\r\nsearch through unrelated materials that may be commingled with criminal\r\nevidence.  In other cases, however, such techniques may not yield the\r\nevidence described in the warrant.  Criminals can mislabel or hide files\r\nand directories, encode communications to avoid using key words, attempt to\r\ndelete files to evade detection, or take other steps designed to frustrate law\r\nenforcement searches for information.  These steps may require agents and\r\nlaw enforcement or other analysts with appropriate expertise to conduct more\r\nextensive searches, such as scanning areas of the disk not allocated to listed\r\nfiles, or peruse every file briefly to determine whether it falls within the\r\nscope of the warrant.  In light of these difficulties, the [applicant]<b><i>\r\n</i></b>intends to use whatever data analysis techniques appear necessary to\r\nlocate and retrieve the evidence . . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 7.<span>            \r\n</span>The judicial officer reviewing the request granted a warrant to search\r\nthe residence and to seize electronic devices to be searched at an off-site\r\nfacility for as long as reasonably necessary.  In a separate order,\r\nhowever, the judicial officer stated only that “[t]he application to search the\r\ncomputer belonging to Eric Gulfield is <u>granted</u>,” and attached\r\nconditions: (1) restricting the police from relying on the plain view\r\ndoctrine to seize any incriminatory electronic record not authorized by the\r\nwarrant—that is, “any digital evidence relating to criminal matters other than\r\nidentity theft offenses”; (2) requiring third parties or specially trained\r\ncomputer personnel to conduct the search behind a “firewall” and provide to\r\nState investigatory agents only “digital evidence relating to identity theft\r\noffenses”<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[2]</span></span><span></span><span></span>;\r\n(3) requiring digital evidence relating to the offenses to be segregated\r\nand redacted from surrounding non-evidentiary data before being delivered to\r\nthe case investigators, “no matter how intermingled it is”; (4) precluding\r\nState police personnel who are involved in conducting the search under\r\ncondition (2) from disclosing their work to prosecutors or investigators;\r\n(5) limiting the search protocol to methods designed to uncover only\r\ninformation for which the State has probable cause; (6) precluding the use\r\nof specialized “hashing tools” and “similar search tools” without specific\r\nauthorization of the court; (7) allowing only evidence “relevant to the targeted\r\nalleged activities” to be copied to provide to State agents; (8) requiring\r\nthe State to return “non-responsive data” and to inform the court of this\r\naction; (9) directing police to destroy remaining copies of electronic\r\ndata absent judicial authorization otherwise; and (10) requiring the State\r\nto file a return within the time limit of the warrant<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[3]</span></span><span></span><span></span> to indicate precisely what data was\r\nobtained, returned, and destroyed.  Law enforcement conducted a search of\r\nthe premises and seized, but did not search, a personal computer and an iPad.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[4]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 8.<span>            \r\n</span>The State then filed a motion for extraordinary relief in this Court requesting\r\nthat the Court strike the ex ante conditions from the warrant.  In support\r\nof its petition, the State argues that the judicial officer lacked authority to\r\nimpose ex ante restrictions on the search; that the conditions are unnecessary\r\nand impede legal development in the area of computer searches; and that the\r\nconditions impermissibly impede effective law enforcement investigation. \r\nThe Defender General and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[5]</span></span><span></span><span></span> submitted briefs as amici curiae in\r\nopposition to the State’s petition.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[6]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n The ACLU argues that computers are fundamentally different from paper\r\nrecords or filing cabinets because of the vast volume of personal data stored\r\nin a computer and due to a computer’s unique ability to retain hidden and\r\ndeleted information and to act as a portal to other remote storages of\r\ninformation.  To protect privacy, the ACLU argues that the Fourth\r\nAmendment demands more stringent requirements to search electronic\r\ndevices.  The Defender General argues that such conditions are key to\r\nprotecting privacy under Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution. \r\nTherefore, both amici contend that the conditions are necessary and not beyond\r\nthe judge’s discretion in issuing a warrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 9.<span>            \r\n</span>We first must address the jurisdictional grounds for this action. \r\nThis is an original jurisdiction case instigated by the State’s direct petition\r\nfor extraordinary relief.  Extraordinary relief is a “flexible procedure” that\r\nis available when all other avenues are closed.  <u>In re Vt. Sup. Ct.\r\nAdmin. Directive No. 17</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></span>, 397, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284463\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284463/directive-no-17-v-vermont-supreme-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span>, 1039\r\n(1990).  Extraordinary relief is, however, limited to when “there is no\r\nadequate remedy by appeal” or by filing for extraordinary relief in the\r\nsuperior court.  V.R.A.P. 21(b).  In this case, there is no remedy by\r\nappeal because the State has no right of appeal from a judge’s decision to\r\ngrant, but condition, a warrant request.  See 13 V.S.A. § 7403 (limiting\r\nState’s ability to appeal in criminal cases to situations where prosecution has\r\nbegun).  The State argued that this is a rare case where extraordinary\r\nrelief is appropriately brought in this Court in the first instance because the\r\nissue raised is a pure question of law that requires no factual\r\ndevelopment.  Cf. <u>In re Hill</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></span>, 86, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2381898\"><a href=\"/opinion/2381898/in-re-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 993\r\n(1987) (per curiam) (dismissing petition for extraordinary relief where issues\r\ncould be dealt with in the course of litigation and on appeal if necessary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 10.<span>        \r\n</span>The Defender General moved to dismiss the petition for lack of\r\njurisdiction, arguing that there was no live controversy because the State’s\r\ncontention of injury was speculative and that there were other available means\r\nfor relief.  The Defender General contended that the State should file its\r\npetition for extraordinary relief in the civil division in the first instance\r\nfor further factual development.  This Court denied the motion.  We\r\nnow reaffirm that denial.  The petition for relief may be decided by this\r\nCourt in the first instance given that the State is challenging the judicial\r\nofficer’s authority to impose the conditions, as in the nature of a mandamus\r\naction, which is a purely legal question that requires no evidentiary\r\nanalysis.  See, e.g., <u>State v. Saari</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></span>, 514-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1989352\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989352/state-v-saari/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 347 (1989).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 11.<span>        \r\n</span>Although we conclude that there is jurisdiction, we also emphasize that\r\nextraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus is a limited remedy.  It is\r\nto be granted only when the State shows that the judge’s decisions “were\r\nusurpations of judicial power, <u>clear</u> abuses of discretion, or arbitrary\r\nabuses of power.”  <u>State v.

Brunette</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2370086\"><a href=\"/opinion/2370086/united-states-v-brunette/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Me. 1999) (“It is settled law that the search and seizure of evidence,\r\nconducted under a warrant, must conform to the requirements of that\r\nwarrant.”).  Enforcing an issuing judicial officer’s directions ensures\r\nthat the warrant requirement is meaningful and effective.  See <u>United\r\nStates v. Leon</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 914 (1984) (“[T]he preference for warrants is\r\nmost appropriately effectuated by according ‘great deference’ to a magistrate’s\r\ndetermination.” (quoting <u>Spinelli v.

Roberts</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></span>, 392,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2328846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2328846/state-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span>, 840 (1993), and this case could involve a variation of this\r\nprinciple.  Our first impression, however, is that this case is less about\r\nthe scope of protections of a constitutional provision and more about the tools\r\navailable to ensure that protection occurs.  Thus, any holding we might\r\nultimately make concerning the scope of Article 11 with respect to ex ante\r\ninstructions will be based on a new analysis of the protections of that Article. \r\nIn view of our disposition of the case under the Fourth Amendment, we decline\r\nto engage in such an analysis in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 16.<span>        \r\n</span>Nor do we rest our decision on Vermont non-constitutional law. \r\nWhile the State argued that Vermont law does not authorize a judicial officer\r\nto impose ex ante instructions, it addressed only Vermont Rule of Criminal\r\nProcedure 41.  It argued that this criminal procedure rule does not\r\nauthorize the magistrate to issue instructions on how the search shall be\r\nconducted.  Although Rule 41 is relevant,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[8]</span></span><span></span><span></span> neither it, nor the federal rule on which\r\nit is based, purport to completely define the scope of judicial power with\r\nrespect to search warrants.  Thus, we are not persuaded on this limited\r\nrecord that Vermont law supports the State’s argument and do not consider it\r\nfurther.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 17.<span>        \r\n</span>Before addressing the substantive claims of error raised, we briefly\r\nmake three points that put our analysis in context and respond to one of the\r\npoints made by the dissent.  First, there are really two searches in this\r\ncase—the first for the computer and the second of the computer.  The first\r\nhas occurred and is not in dispute; the issues relate solely to the second\r\nsearch.  Second, the principal question before us is whether the\r\nwarrant-issuing magistrate had the authority to issue the specific search\r\ninstructions he did, not as the dissent suggests, whether imposing the\r\ninstructions is necessary to comply with the Fourth Amendment or Chapter I,\r\nArticle 11 of the Vermont Constitution.  Third, the State has challenged\r\nthe imposition (or effect) of the instructions in general.  Assuming such\r\ninstructions could be imposed and they are binding under either the federal or\r\nstate constitution, the State has not argued that they were inappropriate in\r\nthis case.  We leave questions about the nature and extent of the\r\nmagistrate’s discretion in this area to another day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 18.<span>        \r\n</span>We now proceed to the main question before us—whether a judicial officer\r\nissuing a warrant has the authority to place ex ante instructions on how a\r\nsearch may be conducted.  We have stated the question broadly because the\r\nState has challenged the authority of the judicial officer to impose any ex\r\nante instructions, not particularly those in this case.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[9]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  We also emphasize that the general\r\nquestion is one of authority, and not responsibility.  No party or amicus\r\nis directly claiming that ex ante instructions are ever required, and we\r\ncertainly do not hold so here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 19.<span>        \r\n</span>Under the Fourth Amendment, people are protected “against unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures.”  U.S. Const. amend.

Kerr, <u>Ex Ante Regulation of Computer Search and Seizure</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. Rev. 1241, 1242 (2010).  Professor Kerr argues that “ex ante\r\nrestrictions on the execution of computer search warrants are constitutionally\r\nunauthorized and unwise.”  <u>Id</u>.  He contends that ex ante\r\nrestrictions are impermissible because they predetermine the reasonableness of\r\na search—a matter that he contends is beyond a magistrate’s authority under the\r\nFourth Amendment.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[11]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nAccording to this view, an issuing officer’s role is only to determine whether\r\nprobable cause exists to search a given location, not to determine the manner\r\nin which a search may be conducted.  Drawing on Professor Kerr’s argument,\r\nthe State contends that the judicial officer exceeded the narrowly\r\ncircumscribed role of an officer reviewing a warrant application and, thus, its\r\ninstructions are not part of the constitutional mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 25.<span>        \r\n</span>The permissibility of imposing the ex ante instructions on computer\r\nsearches is a relatively novel question for courts generally.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[12]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  What tools are at the disposal of\r\njudicial officers in confronting the challenges presented by searches of\r\nelectronic media is a real and important question.  As one court\r\nsuccinctly put it: “Computers are simultaneously file cabinets (with millions\r\nof files) and locked desk drawers; they can be repositories of innocent and\r\ndeeply personal information, but also of evidence of crimes.  The former\r\nmust be protected, the latter discovered.”  <u>United States v.

J.\r\nGoldfoot, <u>The Physical Computer and the Fourth Amendment</u>, 16 Berkeley J.\r\nCrim. L. 112, 123-24 (2011) (“The initial decision to treat storage media as\r\nhaving subcontainers departs from physical moorings; after that departure,\r\nmetaphors are necessary to apply physical rules to the new virtual world.”).\r\n Although the details of computer searches are new and evolving, the need\r\nfor a non-physical concept of particularity is one that courts have already\r\nconfronted.  Warrants for electronic surveillance routinely set out\r\n“minimization” requirements—procedures for how and under what conditions the\r\nelectronic surveillance may be conducted—in order to “afford[] similar\r\nprotections to those that are present in the use of conventional warrants\r\nauthorizing the seizure of tangible evidence.”  <u>Berger v.

Pro. Law § 700.30 (requiring that warrants contain “[a] provision that\r\nthe authorization to intercept or conduct video surveillance . . . shall be\r\nconducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications or\r\nthe making of observations not otherwise subject to eavesdropping or video\r\nsurveillance”).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[13]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nThese provisions in the warrants are ex ante conditions on how a search may be\r\nconducted, but we believe that they are well within the scope of a judicial\r\nofficer’s role in ensuring that searches are targeted with sufficient\r\nparticularity.  The same reasoning applies with even more force in the\r\ncomputer context.  In the digital universe, particular information is not\r\naccessed through corridors and drawers, but through commands and queries. \r\nAs a result, in many cases, the only feasible way to specify a particular\r\n“region” of the computer will be by specifying how to search.  We view\r\nsuch ex ante specification as an acceptable way to determine\r\nparticularity.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 30.<span>        \r\n</span>Further, we do not agree that one can draw a categorical line between\r\nthe probable cause inquiry and considerations of privacy.  Professor\r\nKerr’s argument suggests that consideration of the privacy interests of the\r\nperson to be searched is ultimately irrelevant to a judicial officer issuing a\r\nwarrant.  See Kerr, <u>supra</u>, at 1290-92.  But this picture is\r\noverly rigid, ignoring the fact that the relevant ex ante standards depend on\r\nthe severity of the privacy infringement that is contemplated.  A judicial\r\nofficer might authorize a search of a person, including his pockets, without\r\nany particular basis for thinking that evidence will be found in the person’s\r\npocket as opposed to elsewhere on his person.  But that same officer might\r\npermissibly refuse to authorize a search of the person’s body cavities based on\r\nevidence of similar generality.  See, e.g., <u>United States v. Nelson</u>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678871\"><a href=\"/opinion/678871/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-v-bruce-robert-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 760 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding that probable cause to search\r\ndefendant’s “person” did not include probable cause to perform a body cavity\r\nsearch and that this case clearly exhibits “[t]he need to provide specificity\r\nin a warrant”).  This is not because a person’s rectal cavity is, in any\r\nmeaningful sense, a more “particular” or “specific” location than his left\r\npocket,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[14]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nbut because concerns for privacy inflect our understanding of probable cause\r\nand particularity.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[15]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 31.<span>        \r\n</span>What we ask judicial officers to ensure, therefore, is not simply that\r\nthere is a reason to believe evidence may be uncovered but that there is a\r\nreason that will justify an intrusion on a citizen’s privacy interest.\r\n The investigatory promise must justify the collateral exposure.  See\r\n<u>State v.

Kerr, <u>Searches and Seizures in a\r\nDigital World</u>, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 531, 533 (2005) (“Computers are like containers in a physical sense, homes in a virtual\r\nsense, and vast warehouses in an informational sense.”).  Without caution,\r\nsearches of computers threaten to authorize police culling through more\r\npersonal information than has ever been possible before.  See R. Winick, <u>Searches\r\nand Seizures of Computers and Computer Data</u>, 8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 75,\r\n78 (Fall 1994) (“[T]he massive storage capacity of modern computers creates a\r\nhigh risk of overbroad, wide-ranging searches and seizures.”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 59.<span>        \r\n</span>Because modern computers contain a plethora of private information,\r\nexposing them to wholesale searches presents a special threat of exposing\r\nirrelevant but damaging secrets.  Judge Kleinfeld of the Ninth Circuit\r\nputs the point vividly: </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\"> \r\nThere are just too many secrets on people’s computers, most legal, some\r\nembarrassing, and some potentially tragic in their implications, for loose\r\nliberality in allowing search warrants.  Emails and history links may show\r\nthat someone is ordering medication for a disease being kept secret even from\r\nfamily members.  Or they may show that someone’s child is being counseled\r\nby parents for a serious problem that is none of anyone else’s business.\r\n Or a married mother of three may be carrying on a steamy email\r\ncorrespondence with an old high school boyfriend.  Or an otherwise\r\nrespectable, middle-aged gentleman may be looking at dirty pictures.  Just\r\nas a conscientious public official may be hounded out of office because a party\r\nguest found a homosexual magazine when she went to the bathroom at his house,\r\npeople’s lives may be ruined because of legal but embarrassing materials found\r\non their computers.  And, in all but the largest metropolitan areas, it\r\nreally does not matter whether any formal charges ensue—if the police or other\r\nvisitors find the material, it will be all over town and hinted at in the\r\nnewspaper within a few days. . . .  Sex with children is so\r\ndisgusting to most of us that we may be too liberal in allowing searches when\r\nthe government investigates child pornography cases.  The privacy of\r\npeople’s computers is too important to let it be eroded by sexual disgust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\"><u>United\r\nStates v. Gourde</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793638\"><a href=\"/opinion/793638/united-states-v-micah-j-gourde/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></a></span>, 1077-78 (9th Cir. 2006) (Kleinfeld, J.,\r\ndissenting).  These possibilities do not mean that computers cannot be searched. \r\nBut given the multiplicity and magnitude of the unanticipated injuries that\r\nmight be inflicted by allowing exposure of an entire computer hard drive, it is\r\nunderstandable to seek precautions that might mitigate such injuries.  And\r\ngiven that exposure of embarrassing information to a detached third party\r\nconstitutes a lesser injury, we conclude that the use of third-party screeners\r\nis not so wholly without basis as to constitute an abuse of the judge’s\r\ndiscretion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 60.<span>        \r\n</span>The State raises practical objections to these requirements.\r\n First, the State argues that ex ante instructions will have no practical\r\neffect because the reasonableness of any search will be determined ex post, in\r\nresponse to a motion to suppress, and as a result the instructions “cannot be\r\nenforced.”  The whole point of instructions (2), (3), and (4) is to deny\r\nthe State access to information outside the justification for the warrant and\r\nthus avoid disputes over whether such information can be used in a criminal\r\ncase or otherwise.  As we noted at the outset of this opinion, “It is\r\nsettled law that the search and seizure of evidence, conducted under a warrant,\r\nmust conform to the requirements of that warrant.”  <u>United States v.\r\nBrunette</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2370086\"><a href=\"/opinion/2370086/united-states-v-brunette/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 42 (D. Me. 1999).  The decision in <u>Richards\r\nv. Wisconsin</u>, upon which the State relies, stands only for the proposition\r\nthat suppression might not be required where the noncompliance is based on an\r\nunanticipated circumstance, too urgent in nature for the warrant to be amended. \r\n520 U.S. at 395-96 (accepting police decision not to knock and announce after\r\nalready having had door slammed in their face by suspect upon seeing uniformed\r\nindividual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 61.<span>        \r\n</span>We agree with the State that ex post review will always remain open, but\r\nthis does not mean that the ex ante instructions are without legal\r\nsignificance.  Indeed, our holding today is that there is no\r\nconstitutional distinction between instructions on how a search will be\r\nconducted and other instructions that, for example, relate to when the search\r\nmust occur.  See V.R.Cr.P. 41(c) (warrant shall “command the officer to\r\nsearch within a specified period of time not to exceed 10 days”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 62.<span>        \r\n</span>Second, the State argues that the requirement to use a non-investigator\r\nto conduct the search “without the presence or input of the investigator may\r\nresult in relevant evidence being missed.”  In responding to this\r\nargument, we note that the State chooses the person(s) conducting the search\r\nand can ensure that the person(s) have the skill to recognize relevant\r\nevidence.  Further, the concept of a firewall does not preclude the State\r\nfrom educating the person(s) conducting the search in the nature alleged\r\ncrimes, as long as the person(s) conducting the search do not share extraneous\r\ninformation with the State investigator.  We do not conclude that there is\r\na practical defect in the condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 63.<span>        \r\n</span>Third, the State argues that the segregation requirement will prevent a\r\ndynamic investigation in which the search can be expanded based upon what\r\ninformation is uncovered.  Again, we find that the State overstates the\r\nobjection.  Nothing in instruction 5 states that on receipt of information\r\nfrom the search, the criminal investigator cannot ask for additional searching\r\nspecifying the relevance of additional evidence in light of what evidence was\r\nproduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 64.<span>        \r\n</span>We therefore deny the request for extraordinary relief with regard to\r\ninstructions (2), (3), and (4).  This result is based largely on the broad\r\nauthorization sought by the applicant law enforcement officer and the affidavit\r\nsupporting that application.  The judicial officer concluded that\r\nresorting to a neutral third-party screener may be the only way to provide\r\nmeaningful privacy protections in the face of broad law enforcement requests\r\nlike this one.  See <u>CDT I</u>, 579 F.3d at 1007 (“In the end\r\n. . . we must rely on the good sense and vigilance of our magistrate\r\njudges, who are in the front line of preserving the constitutional freedoms of\r\nour citizens while assisting the government in its legitimate efforts to\r\nprosecute criminal activity.  Nothing we could say would substitute for\r\nthe sound judgment that judicial officers must exercise in striking this\r\ndelicate balance.”).  We hold that such an order does protect a legitimate\r\nprivacy interest and did not constitute a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\" align=\"center\">C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 65.<span>        \r\n</span>Next, we turn to the instructions limiting the search techniques that\r\npolice can employ and prohibiting the use of sophisticated searching software\r\nwithout prior court authorization.  The judge directed police to use a\r\nsearch protocol “designed to uncover only the information for which the State\r\nhas probable cause” by focusing on documents limited by: the time period\r\nrelevant to the alleged criminal activity, key words, and specific file\r\ntypes.  The judge also precluded use of sophisticated search techniques\r\nwithout prior authorization.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[23]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 66.<span>        \r\n</span>Under the order, these instructions are imposed on the persons(s) who\r\nconduct the search under instruction (2) and were within the court’s power to\r\nensure satisfaction of the probable cause and particularity requirements of the\r\nFourth Amendment and Article 11.  As noted, the warrant application sought\r\nto examine every file on every type of electronic media found at the location\r\nlisted in the warrant, regardless of ownership.  In the judicial officer’s\r\nview, this application did not provide probable cause for such a broad search\r\nwithout some further specification of the particular places to be searched and\r\nthe particular items to be seized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 67.<span>        \r\n</span>As we have already discussed, especially in a non-physical context,\r\nparticularity may be achieved through specification of how a search will be\r\nconducted.  The purpose of the particularity requirement is to prevent\r\ngeneral searches.  <u>Maryland v.

Carey</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763086\"><a href=\"/opinion/763086/united-states-v-patrick-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span>, 1271-72 (10th Cir. 1999) (“The Fourth Amendment requires that a\r\nsearch warrant describe the things to be seized with sufficient particularity\r\nto prevent a general exploratory rummaging in a person’s belongings.”). \r\nParticularity is measured in practical terms.  <u>United States v.

(1960))). \r\nThe State is not persuasive in its claims that the limits will unduly hamper\r\ndetection of crime.  The equipment is seized and secured in the State’s\r\npossession.  After exhausting its search options as permitted by the\r\nconditions of particularity, nothing precludes the State from seeking a new\r\nwarrant to employ more sophisticated search techniques or a more probing\r\nanalysis of the electronic media based on the results—or frustration—of their\r\ninitial search, providing probable cause remains.  The State’s request for\r\nextraordinary relief from these instructions is therefore denied.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\" align=\"center\">D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 75.<span>        \r\n</span>Finally, we address those instructions pertaining to the copying,\r\nreturn, and destruction of property.  The judicial officer set\r\ninstructions requiring that: (1) only responsive information could be copied;\r\n(2) non-responsive data should be returned and the court informed; (3) copies\r\nmust be destroyed absent judicial authorization otherwise; and (4) the return\r\nshould specify the information seized, returned, and destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 76.<span>        \r\n</span>These instructions would hardly seem novel if imposed on law enforcement\r\nat the initial search phase.  It goes without saying that law enforcement\r\nofficers are empowered to seize and copy only items that are responsive to a\r\nwarrant and, in turn, to inventory the items seized and return this list to the\r\ncourt.  Indeed, under the Rules of Criminal Procedure, law enforcement\r\nofficers conducting a search are required to give the person from whom property\r\nis taken “a receipt.”  V.R.Cr.P. 41(d).  The officer must also make\r\nand file with the court a return, including a written inventory of the property\r\ntaken.  <u>Id</u>.  The rule allows a grieved individual to move for\r\nreturn of property seized illegally.  V.R.Cr.P. 41(e).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 77.<span>        \r\n</span>In this case, the unique aspect of these instructions arises because the\r\nwarrant authorized law enforcement to seize electronic medium to be searched\r\noff-site.  As we noted initially, we are really dealing with two searches\r\nhere.  Apparently, the judicial officer wished to emphasize that although\r\nthe State was authorized to search off-site, this did not provide authority for\r\nthe State to retain indefinitely all electronic data and law enforcement was\r\nstill required to return or destroy nonresponsive data as well as to notify the\r\ncourt of the items retained and returned.  Given that the judicial\r\nofficer’s instructions essentially echo the requirements of Rule 41, we\r\nconclude that it was within the officer’s power to impose them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 78.<span>        \r\n</span>In reaching our conclusion, we do not conclude that instruction (7) or\r\n(8) prevents the segregated search persons from imaging the computer hard drive\r\nand other electronic storage media so that the computer and media can be\r\nreturned to its owner.  That procedure gives the State full search\r\ncapacity while minimizing the interference with the activities of the computer\r\nowner.  It was used in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 79.<span>        \r\n</span>Instruction (7) prohibits giving copies of extraneous information to\r\nState investigation agents.  It does not prohibit the persons conducting\r\nthe search from making copies or images for their own use as long as they are\r\ndestroyed, as provided in instruction (9).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 80.<span>        \r\n</span>Nor do we read instruction (9) as prohibiting the maintenance of\r\nevidence for appeals, post-conviction relief and civil liability, as the State\r\nclaims.  In circumstances where the State can show that digital\r\ninformation should be kept for a specific reason—for example, for an appeal of\r\na dispute over the validity of or compliance with ex ante instructions—the\r\ninstruction authorizes the State to seek a judicial authorization to delay\r\ndestruction.  Otherwise, the overall procedure leaves a sufficient record\r\nfor future proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 81.<span>        \r\n</span>Finally, we reject the State’s argument that instruction (10) imposes an\r\narbitrary time limit on the search, even though the search may take a long,\r\nindeterminate time to finish.  Although instruction (10) authorizes the\r\njudicial officer to impose a time limit in the warrant on completing the search\r\nand filing a return, the warrant itself imposes no time limit and authorizes\r\nthe analysis be conducted “as long as reasonably necessary.”  Under these\r\ncircumstances, the State’s argument is premature.  In any event, we\r\nreiterate that there are two searches here and just as the applicable criminal\r\nrule can impose a time limit on the initial search of the dwelling, see\r\nV.R.Cr.P. 41(c), the magistrate can impose a time limit on the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 82.<span>        \r\n</span>In sum, we conclude that the judicial officer did not contravene his\r\npower in imposing instructions concerning the manner of the law enforcement’s\r\nsearch of the computer to satisfy the probable cause and particularity demands\r\nof the warrant requirement.  However, we hold there was no authority to\r\npreclude law enforcement’s seizure of items in plain view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u>The petition for extraordinary\r\nrelief is granted in

gag\r\ncondition and segregated searchers, and presents no violation of any privacy\r\nright guaranteed against unreasonable search and seizure.  No one\r\ncomplains that the warrant is insufficiently particular.  The majority\r\nagrees there is no constitutional limitation on observing evidence of other\r\ncrimes in plain view during a valid search.  The majority can point to no\r\ninfraction of the Fourth Amendment, actual or threatened, to justify its ex\r\nante limits on plain view.  Given that the warrant application is\r\notherwise valid, the majority’s holding provides little instruction to the\r\ntrial bench on when and how to apply such segregated searches in the future\r\nsince no constitutional right requires application of this extraordinary\r\nmeasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 90.<span>        \r\n</span>Further, whatever computer privacy the majority supposes to protect will\r\nbe already and completely compromised by the warrant and the search, even when\r\nexecuted by the majority’s gagged search team.  Whether viewed by the case\r\ninvestigator or segregated police, or some other police agent, the\r\ncourt-ordered privacy invasion is the same.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[26]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  These conditions mean that just as\r\nmuch private information will be exposed to the view of government\r\nstrangers.  As acknowledged and argued by amicus ACLU, “the harm to\r\nprivacy interests is complete when the protected material is viewed.”  In\r\nreal life, requiring that a search be executed by one police agent versus\r\nanother results in no actual limit on the search and, so, no actual protection\r\nof privacy.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 91.<span>        \r\n</span>The majority’s segregated screening conditions result in no less of a\r\nsearch, no less intrusion into the computer’s files, and no less potential for observing\r\nother incriminating evidence in plain view of the searchers.  Thus,\r\nrequiring a search by different, segregated and muted investigators serves no\r\nFourth Amendment privacy interest whatsoever.  Protecting no actual\r\nprivacy, the majority simply conjures up immunity for computer owners whose\r\ndata includes proof of other crimes in plain view during a valid search. \r\nAt the same time, such immunity does not exist for property holders whose\r\nhomes, bedrooms, closets, file cabinets, files, and purses are lawfully\r\nsearched—because the constitution does not require it.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 92.<span>        \r\n</span>Nor does the constitution require such immunity for computer\r\ncontent.  If the issuing court was concerned about lack of probable cause\r\nor particularity as the majority asserts, <u>ante</u>, ¶ 43, then the\r\ncourt was free to deny the warrant application or limit the search\r\naccordingly.  Neither probable cause nor the application’s particularity\r\nis challenged here.  The majority’s endorsement of the\r\nsilenced-and-segregated-search-team condition succeeds in defeating actual\r\nplain view, but utterly fails to increase particularity or narrow the scope of\r\nthe search.  As noted above, the search—the actual invasion of privacy\r\napplied for by the State and authorized by the warrant—is exactly the same,\r\nwhether conducted by investigators assigned to the case, or by the judicially\r\ngagged investigators preferred by the majority. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 93.<span>        \r\n</span>Patently incorrect is the majority’s assertion that investigators will\r\nnever view incriminating evidence unrelated to identity theft offenses. \r\nThe majority imagines that ordering the search be conducted by police\r\ninvestigators not assigned to <u>this</u> investigation somehow “obviate[s],”\r\nor prevents, plain view from occurring.  <u>Ante</u>, ¶ 37.  If this\r\nwere true, there would be no need for the gag order.  But since it is\r\nclear that plain view of other incriminating evidence by the other police\r\nsearch team can still occur, the supposed prevention can only result from the\r\ngag order that prevents its disclosure.  Thus, declares the majority,\r\ngagging the search team is “not an abrogation of the plain view doctrine,” but\r\na safeguard “against the police plainly viewing.”  <u>Ante</u>,\r\n¶ 44.  All winking aside, the search is still authorized by the\r\nwarrant, privacy is still invaded by government search agents, and any other\r\nevidence in plain view is still seen.  The old saying about being “just a\r\nlittle bit pregnant” comes to mind.  That adage, of course—like pretending\r\na search is not a search, and that evidence in plain view is not seen or even\r\ndoes not exist—is a fallacy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 94.<span>        \r\n</span>There is not cited a single Fourth Amendment case to support the\r\nmajority’s sabotage of the plain view doctrine.  This is because the\r\nFourth Amendment expressly proscribes unreasonable searches, and it is\r\nundisputed that a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause\r\nand approved by a magistrate is not unreasonable.  It is equally settled\r\nthat where a magistrate authorizes a valid search under the Fourth Amendment,\r\nthere is no constitutionally protected privacy against such an intrusion.\r\nCertainly most people prefer that police not enter their homes or computers to\r\nsearch, but if a warrant issues then the proprietor is without right to\r\nresist.  See <u>Gasho v.

the issue, if the necessary probable cause is\r\nmade out, a warrant can issue to find a needle in a haystack or a needle in a\r\nhouse or office.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 100.<span>    \r\n</span>Moreover, given no dispute that the State may seize incriminating\r\nevidence noticed in plain view during an otherwise valid search, those\r\nrestrictions are a bald

ignorance to a\r\nconstitutionally authorized plain view of criminal evidence.  Eliminating\r\nplain view ad hoc in a particular search through the ex ante artifice of a\r\nseparate and gagged search

separation and screening condoned by the majority does not protect\r\nactual privilege or privacy, does not further a Fourth Amendment privacy\r\ninterest, and does not lend further particularity to the search.  The sole\r\npurpose of the segregation and gag order is to discard the plain view\r\ndoctrine—something the majority already agrees is beyond the issuing court’s\r\nauthority.  I must
