INTRODUCTION\n\n        In what may be an oversimplification, we introduce our\nopinion on this appeal by setting forth that the central\ncontroversy is a dispute over whether African American students\nin the Lower Merion School District (“LMSD”) public schools\nin Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, were deprived of\nappropriate educational services due to racial discrimination and\nsegregation in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs\nunsuccessfully brought this action pursuant to the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et\nseq.; the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n\n                               9\n\f§§ 12101, 12132; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the\n“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (“Title VI”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and\nstate law, claiming that African American students in the LMSD\nsuffered from such discrimination.1 They now appeal from\nportions of the District Court’s orders on federal issues entered\n\n1\n  During the course of the District Court proceedings, plaintiffs,\nbased on a then recent examination by a psychologist, asserted\nthat five or six of the student plaintiffs had been identified\nincorrectly as being learning disabled. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 12, 14, 19, 36. Therefore, at oral argument before us\nthe parties focused on the Title VI and § 1983 claims, as the\nDistrict Court had held that the IDEA, ADA and RA were\ninapplicable to the claims of the plaintiffs who by then\ncontended that they wrongly had been identified. The plaintiffs’\narguments were further limited because the IDEA, ADA, and\nRA claims of all individual plaintiffs except those of one family,\nthe Blunts, were dismissed as a result of their failure to exhaust\nIDEA administrative remedies. Recently, however, in a related\ncase, S.H. v. Lower Merion School District, 729 F.3d 248 (3d\nCir. 2013), involving litigants who also are parties to this action,\nwe held that students incorrectly identified as learning disabled\nmay not bring claims under the IDEA, though they still may\nhave claims under the RA and the ADA. Id. at 257, 260-61.\nBut, as far as we can ascertain, Amber Blunt, a student plaintiff,\nand her parents continue to press their original claims under the\nIDEA. Consequently, we address a statute of limitations issue\nrelating to their IDEA claims even though Amber now claims\nthat she is not learning disabled.\n\n\n                                10\n\fat various times during the course of the litigation. We,\nhowever, are not concerned with the substance of the state law\nclaims on this appeal as the District Court did not exercise\njurisdiction over those claims.\n\n       This case encompasses a myriad of legal issues, including\nstanding to bring suit, application of a statute of limitations, res\njudicata (claim preclusion), application of disability laws,\nappropriateness of education provided to students, anti-\ndiscrimination laws, and sections of the Code of Federal\nRegulations implementing the applicable laws. The case on\nappeal also includes a cross-appeal by the LMSD, but we will\ndismiss the cross-appeal without deciding it on the merits as it is\nmoot. The District Court found that the plaintiffs did not\npresent sufficient evidence to survive LMSD’s motion for\nsummary judgment on the discrimination charges and the Court\ndismissed plaintiffs’ other claims for other reasons. Thus, the\nCourt did not find that there had been any violations of federal\nlaw.\n\n       Plaintiffs, now appellants, appeal from the District\nCourt’s October 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order\ngranting a final summary judgment to defendant LMSD and\nagainst all the plaintiffs in the case remaining at the time that the\nCourt granted summary judgment, the Court already having\ndismissed several of the parties and claims from the case by\nprevious orders.2 Appellants also appeal from rulings in two\n\n2\n  Throughout the opinion we sometimes refer to the plaintiffs\nand appellants collectively even though two different groups of\nplaintiffs filed separate appeals which have been consolidated\n\n                                 11\n\fintermediate orders that became final at the time of the entry of\nthe October 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order,\nnamely: the dismissal of all claims of plaintiffs, now appellants,\nAmber Blunt, a now former student at LMSD, and Crystal and\nMichael Blunt, her parents, in the District Court’s memorandum\nand order of February 15, 2008, the “February 15, 2008 Order”;\nthe dismissal of all plaintiffs’ claims against the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Education (“PDE”) in the District Court’s order\nand memorandum of August 19, 2009, the “August 19, 2009\nOrder”; and the dismissal of plaintiff Concerned Black Parents\nof Mainline Inc. (“CBP”) as a party in the District Court’s\nAugust 19, 2009 Order for lack of standing. Appellants’ No.\n11-4201 br. at 1.\n\n        Plaintiffs, with the exception of the CBP and the\nmainline branch of the NAACP (the “NAACP”), are present and\npast African American students of the Lower Merion Township\npublic schools, who were placed in remedial classes after being\nidentified as learning “disabled” under the IDEA and/or those\nstudents’ parents. The plaintiffs repeatedly used the term\n“disabled” to describe the student plaintiffs throughout the\npleadings, a term consistent with the IDEA, a statute under\nwhich they were making claims, as the IDEA safeguards the\n\nalong with the cross-appeal of the LMSD. Though LMSD is a\ncross-appellant we do not include it when we refer to appellants.\n We usually refer to the parties who brought this action as\nplaintiffs when describing proceedings in the District Court and\nas appellants when describing proceedings in this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\frights of disabled students. Nevertheless, at this stage in the\nlitigation some appellants argue that the LMSD incorrectly\nidentified them as learning disabled,3 thereby causing them\ninjury.4 Appellants claim that their placement in remedial\n\n3\n Even though by the time that the District Court considered the\nmotion for summary judgment most of the student plaintiffs\nremaining in the case asserted that they had been misidentified\nas learning disabled, the pleadings continued to identify the\nstudents as learning disabled. In rendering its opinion on the\nsummary judgment motion, notwithstanding the pleadings, the\nCourt assumed with two exceptions that the student plaintiffs\nwere not disabled. We also note that Appellants’ No. 11-4201\nbr. at 1 n.2 recites that the correct name of Concerned Black\nParents of Mainline Inc. is simply Concerned Black Parents, Inc.\n4\n    The Code of Federal Regulations sets forth that:\n\n         Child with a disability means a child evaluated in\n         accordance with §§ 300.304 through 300.311 as having\n         mental retardation, a hearing impairment (including\n         deafness), a speech or language impairment, a visual\n         impairment (including blindness), a serious emotional\n         disturbance (referred to in this part as ‘emotional\n         disturbance’), an orthopedic impairment, autism,\n         traumatic brain injury, an other [sic] health impairment, a\n         specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple\n         disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, needs special\n         education and related services.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.8(a)(1).\n\n\n                                 13\n\fclasses had a negative impact on their opportunity for\neducational advancement, but by the time of the proceedings on\nthe motion for summary judgment they were seeking relief in\nthe District Court only pursuant to Title VI and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment through 42\nU.S.C. § 1983. Appellants’ case is largely based on their\ncontention that the disproportionate placement of African\nAmerican students in remedial classes had a discriminatory\npurpose and was the result of racial bias.5\n\n       Ultimately, the summary judgment question turns on\nwhether there is enough record evidence to establish that LMSD\nintentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs, whether\nthrough its own actions or by failing to correct a third party’s\n\n\n\n5\n  Initially, the individually named students sought to bring their\nclaims on their own behalf and on behalf of the students\nsimilarly situated as a class action; however, the District Court\nruled that class certification was inappropriate due to the highly\nindividualized aspects of each student’s claims. (No. 2:07-cv-\n3100, Doc. No. 124). At oral argument, one appellants’\nattorney acknowledged that the District Court had been correct\nin not certifying the case as a class action (Tr. Oral Arg. June\n11, 2013, at 6:18-21, 14:4-7 (“You can’t remedy it as a class\naction . . . because of the individual issues.”)), and thus\nappellants no longer seek to proceed in this case on a class\naction basis.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fintentional discrimination. Looking at the whole record, which\nincludes statistical evidence showing that minorities are\noverrepresented in low achievement classes, we conclude that\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact concerning LMSD’s\nintent. There is no evidence showing that the District intended\nto discriminate against plaintiffs, nor that LMSD had knowledge\nof any intentional discrimination on the part of its employees,\nincluding deliberate indifference to discriminatory practices\nagainst African American students as a form of intentional\ndiscrimination. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n        II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       This suit has had many plaintiffs and defendants, though\nsome have come and gone, and includes many related issues and\nclaims.6 We now are dealing with what is left of this litigation\n6\n  The District Court’s docket sheets lists numerous cases with\nseparate numbers as being related to this action. It is\nparticularly significant that in a related case, S.H. v. Lower\nMerion School District, No. 2:10-cv-06070, in the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania involving two of the same litigants that\nare parties in this case, Carol Durrell and her daughter,\nidentified in that case as “S.H.” and in this case as “Saleema\nHall,” that we have decided an appeal in a precedential opinion.\n See S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir.\n2013). Saleema Hall is identified as a litigant in the most recent\nversion of the complaint in this case in the caption as is her\nsister, Chantae Hall and her mother, Carol Durrell.\n\n                               15\n\fby entertaining the present appeals which have been\nconsolidated with the cross-appeal in this Court under No. 11-\n4200.7\n\n       The plaintiffs filed the original complaint on July 30,\n2007. At that time the plaintiffs were current or former students\nin the LMSD, four parents, and the two organizations that we\nhave identified.8 The original defendants were the LMSD and\n\n       We note that S.H. changed her theory of recovery in the\nother action from her theory in this case, although she filed it\nunder the same statutes based on the same set of facts on which\nshe previously had relied in this case. Her theory in the other\naction was that she is not and never has been learning disabled\nand was placed improperly in special education classes. Id. at\n255-56. Other student plaintiffs in this case have asserted the\nsame theory of liability (incorrect identification as learning\ndisabled), but inasmuch as Saleema Hall and Carroll Durell have\nnot withdrawn as plaintiffs in this litigation (they were named in\nthe third amended complaint) it appears that they press their\nclaims in the two cases on both theories though they are\ninconsistent.\n7\n   DLA Piper, LLP and the Public Interest Law Center of\nPhiladelphia represent separate groups of appellants and have\nfiled separate briefs on their behalf. For the sake of clarity we\nwill distinguish between their briefs on the basis of the appeal\nnumbers.\n8\n The original plaintiffs were Amber Blunt, on behalf of herself\nand all others similarly situated; Crystal Blunt and Michael\nBlunt, on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly\n\n                               16\n\ftwo of its officials in their official capacity.9 No. 2:07-cv-3100,\nDoc. No. 1.10\n\n      The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on\nSeptember 26, 2007, adding three plaintiffs (two current or\nformer students in the LMSD and one parent)11 and several\n\nsituated; Linda Johnson, on her own behalf, on behalf of her\ndaughter, Lydia Johnson, and all others similarly situated; Carol\nDurrell, on her own behalf, on behalf of her minor daughter,\nSaleema Hall, and on behalf of all others similarly situated;\nChristine Dudley, on her own behalf, and on behalf of her minor\nson, Walter Whiteman, and on behalf of all others similarly\nsituated; Eric Allston on his own behalf and on behalf of all\nothers similarly situated; Concerned Black Parents, Inc.; and the\nMainline Branch of the NAACP. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No.\n1.\n9\n The officials were Jamie Savedoff, Superintendent, and\nMichael Kelly, Director of Pupil Services. No. 2:07-cv-3100,\nDoc. No. 1.\n\n\n10\n   Though the parties sometimes have used the term “the\nDistrict” to refer to the LMSD, because this usage may be\nconfusing inasmuch as we regularly refer to the District Court,\nwe have used the term “LMSD.”\n11\n  Chantae Hall, the daughter of Carroll Durrell and sister of\nSaleema Hall, both of whom were parties in the original\ncomplaint, was added as were June Coleman, on her own behalf\n\n                                17\n\fdefendants, including the Lower Merion School Board, its\nPresident, Vice President, and various members of the Board\n(together, the “School Board”), the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation (the “PDE”), and two of its officials. No. 2:07-cv-\n3100, Doc. No. 10. Inasmuch as the LMSD and the School\nBoard have the same interest in this case and are represented by\nthe same attorneys, we sometimes refer to them together as the\nLMSD. The plaintiffs named the PDE as a defendant because\nthey believed that it failed to meet the supervisory, monitoring\nand compliance procedural obligations that federal law imposed\non it. The FAC concerned, inter alia, as appellants indicate in\none of their briefs, “a decision of the Pennsylvania Special\nEducation Due Process Appeals Review Panel (the ‘Appeals\nPanel’) pursuant to the IDEA.” Appellants’ No. 11-4201 br. at\n8-9;12 see also J.A. vol. 2, at 91-151. As stated above, the\n\n\nand on behalf of her minor son, Richard “Ricky” Coleman, and\non behalf of all others similarly situated.\n12\n   The brief further explains that Crystal and Michael Blunt are\nthe parents of Amber Blunt, a 2005 graduate of Lower Merion\nHigh School who “was identified as a student with a Specific\nLearning Disability.” Appellants’ No. 11-4201 br. at 8-9. The\nBlunts sought payment by LMSD for the tuition for a six-week\nremedial program that West Chester University required Amber\nto take as a condition of her admission. Id. The Blunts argued\nthat the LMSD “should pay for this program to compensate for\nthe fact that it failed to develop and implement transition\nservices for Amber as required by the IDEA.” Id. The Blunts\nalso were dissatisfied that Amber was not admitted into her first\nchoice college, Temple University, although two of the three\n\n                               18\n\foriginal complaint alleged that the defendants violated the\nIDEA, 34 C.F.R. § 300.600 (regarding the monitoring\nrequirements imposed on states receiving federal funds for\neducation of students with disabilities), the ADA, § 504 of the\nRA, Title VI, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, all premised on the theory\nthat plaintiffs had learning disabilities for which LMSD had not\nmade adequate provisions. The FAC invoked the same legal\ntheories/statutes as the original complaint. J.A. vol. 2, at 91-\n151.\n\n       On October 8, 2007, LMSD and the School Board filed a\nmotion to dismiss the FAC, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed\nto exhaust their administrative remedies, the CBP and NAACP\ndid not have standing, and the FAC failed to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. They also contended that the\nIDEA action was untimely. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 11.\n\n        On November 19, 2007, the PDE filed a motion to\ndismiss the FAC for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.13 No.\n2:07-cv-3100, Doc. Nos. 21-22; J.A. vol. 2, at 284. PDE argued\nthat the Blunt plaintiffs’ claims fell outside the IDEA’s statute\nof limitations and that the other individual student plaintiffs had\nnot exhausted their administrative remedies under the IDEA. Id.\n The PDE further argued that its sovereign immunity barred the\n\ncolleges to which she applied did admit her.\n13\n  Gerald Zohorchak and John Tommasini, who were named in\ntheir official capacities as officers of PDE, joined in this motion\nbut they no longer are parties to this suit, and appellants do not\nchallenge their dismissal.\n\n\n                                19\n\fstate law claims asserted against it, and that plaintiffs had failed\nto state a claim upon which relief could be granted against it.\nId.\n\n        On February 15, 2008, the District Court entered an order\ndismissing various plaintiffs and claims from the FAC. The\nCourt methodically eliminated each federal law claim that the\nBlunt plaintiffs made against each defendant. In particularly\nsignificant holdings that we address at length below, the Court\nheld that a 90-day statute of limitations in the IDEA barred the\nBlunts’ claims under the IDEA, RA, and ADA and that a\nseparate two-year statute of limitations barred their other claims.\n Consequently, the order dismissed the Blunts’ federal claims in\ntheir entirety, although their state law claims remained. See No.\n2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 9; see also J.A. vol. I, at 42.42-42.45.\nThe Court also determined that the individual plaintiffs, other\nthan the Blunts, had not sought an administrative remedy for\ntheir IDEA claims, and therefore it dismissed the IDEA claims\nof the remaining individual plaintiffs against the LMSD\ndefendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.16. However, the Court found that the individual plaintiffs\ndid not need to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to\ntheir claims against the PDE because Pennsylvania regulations\nprovide for administrative resolution of disputes between\nstudents, their parents, and their representatives and school\ndistricts, but do not provide for administrative resolution of\nsimilar disputes with the Commonwealth. Id. at 42.17.\n\n      The District Court also dismissed plaintiffs’ ADA and\nRA claims (other than the Blunts’ claims) against the LMSD and\nthe School Board for failure to exhaust their administrative\n\n\n                                20\n\fremedies, reasoning that the claims were based on the same\nallegations as plaintiffs’ IDEA claims and that, if the plaintiffs\nwere entitled to relief, it would have been available through the\nIDEA administrative dispute process. Id. at 42.18-42.19. The\nCourt noted that “[t]he parties agree[d]” regarding the\nexhaustion requirement for those claims. Id. The Court found,\nhowever, that the IDEA exhaustion requirement did not bar\nplaintiffs’ claims under Title VI because, unlike the IDEA, Title\nVI does not “focus on ‘the rights of children with disabilities.’”\nId. at 42.19. The Court also did not find that the plaintiffs\nneeded to exhaust their § 1983 claims administratively.\n\n        In addition, as we indicated above, the District Court\nconcluded that the NAACP and CBP lacked standing as\nplaintiffs.14 Id. at 42.33. The Court also found that the counts\nagainst individual defendants in their official capacity (as\nrepresentatives of the other defendants, LMSD, the School\nBoard and PDE) were duplicative, and therefore it dismissed the\nFAC against those individuals to “simplify[ ] the litigation in a\nway that does not cause any prejudice to plaintiffs.”15 Id. at\n42.35-42.36.\n\n14\n   Although the NAACP attempted in the next version of the\ncomplaint to allege facts to support its standing, as we already\nhave indicated it does not appeal from the holding that it does\nnot have standing. On the other hand, CBP has appealed from\nthe order dismissing it from the case because of its lack of\nstanding.\n15\n   The appellants have not appealed from this ruling and we\ntherefore will not discuss it further.\n\n                               21\n\f       The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”)\non July 8, 2008, adding two plaintiffs, one parent and one\nstudent.16 No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 49. The SAC, in accord\nwith the District Court’s February 15, 2008 Order, removed as\ndefendants the School Board members previously so-named in\ntheir official capacities. But the SAC continued to name the\nSchool Board in its caption though it did not make allegations\nagainst the School Board in its body. The SAC, however,\nincluded the PDE and two of its officials as defendants. The\nSAC continued to name the Blunts as plaintiffs, despite the\ncircumstance that the Court had dismissed all of their federal\nclaims in its February 15, 2008 Order.17 The SAC also added\nseveral paragraphs discussing the CBP’s alleged increase of\nexpenditures that it attributed to “the inferior quality of LMSD’s\ndual system of education.” Moreover, the SAC named several\npersons who the CBP claimed were members of that\norganization in a clear attempt to demonstrate that the CBP had\nstanding. SAC at 34-36. In addition, the SAC added six\nparagraphs regarding plaintiff NAACP’s expenditure of\n\n16\n  The added plaintiffs were Lynda Muse, on behalf of herself\nand her minor son, Quiana Griffin, and on behalf of all others\nsimilarly situated. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 49.\n17\n   In contending that the District Court had jurisdiction,\nplaintiffs argued that “[t]he Blunt Plaintiffs have fully exhausted\ntheir administrative remedies under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §\n1415; the other individual Plaintiffs are excused from doing so\nbecause such efforts would be futile.” No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc.\nNos. 9, 55; J.A. vol. 2, at 95.\n\n\n                                22\n\fresources in addressing alleged issues with the LMSD. SAC at\n37-38.18\n\n        The plaintiffs filed a third and final amended complaint\n(“TAC”) on August 5, 2008. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 55;\nJ.A. vol. 9, 3847-97. The plaintiffs remained the same in the\nTAC as previously except that one parent was no longer a\nplaintiff.19 The TAC, however, no longer named two officials\nof the School Board as defendants, and it did not name the\nofficials of the PDE that the plaintiffs previously had named as\ndefendants. The TAC continued to list the School Board as a\nnamed defendant in the caption, and the PDE and LMSD\nremained named defendants in both the caption and the body of\nthe TAC.20 Despite the District Court’s dismissal of all of the\n\n18\n  Inasmuch as the NAACP is no longer a party in this litigation,\nthese paragraphs are now immaterial.\n\n\n19\n  Linda Johnson, the parent of Lydia Johnson, was dropped as a\nplaintiff in the TAC. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 55; J.A. vol.\n9, 3847-97. Nevertheless, she was listed as an appellant in the\nnotice of appeal.\n20\n     Specifically, in the introduction to the TAC:\n\n         3. Plaintiffs assert that LMSD routinely misuses so-\n         called below grade level programs and modified classes\n         to remove African American students from the general\n         education curriculum, in some instances to avoid\n         evaluating a student’s eligibility for services under the\n\n                                 23\n\fBlunts’ federal claims in the complaint in its February 15, 2008\nOrder, the TAC included them again in Count VI against the\nLMSD and the School Board pursuant to the Pennsylvania\nPublic School Code, 22 Pa. Code §14.102 et. seq.21 Plaintiffs\n\n       IDEA. Plaintiffs further assert that LMSD intentionally\n       segregates these African American students in classes\n       that are taught below grade level while depriving them of\n       grade-level subject matter and materials that are provided\n       to their Caucasian peers at all educational levels.\n\n       4.     Plaintiffs also assert that the Pennsylvania\n       Department of Education (PDE) failed to enforce the\n       IDEA’s mandate that it ensure that children with\n       disabilities receive an appropriate education in the least\n       restrictive environment and that African American\n       children in the LMSD are not inappropriately over-\n       identified or disproportionately placed in special\n       education classes. By their claims against PDE,\n       Plaintiffs seek to remedy wide-spread violations of the\n       Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the\n       Fourteenth Amendment . . . the IDEA, the [ADA],\n       [Section 504 of the RA], [Title VI] and Section 1983 of\n       the Civil Rights Act of 18971 [sic].\n\nTAC at 2-3; J.A. vol. 9, at 3848-49.\n21\n   Several pages of the alleged factual basis for the Blunts’\nclaims, appearing in the “Parties” section of the SAC, were\ndeleted in the TAC, and the identification of Amber and her\nparents as “African American” was added to that section. No.\n2:07-cv-3100 Doc. Nos. 36, 55.\n\n                               24\n\fsought widespread injunctive relief and “compensatory damages\neach on their own behalf to offset the deprivations of an\nappropriate education to which they are entitled.” TAC at 3,\npara. 6; J.A. vol. 9, at 3849.\n\n      The LMSD and the School Board filed an answer to the\nTAC and a separate motion for judgment on the pleadings on\nAugust 15, 2008. The PDE filed an answer to the TAC on\nAugust 19, 2008. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 58.\n\n        On August 15, 2008, the LMSD and the School Board\nfiled a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings addressed to\nthe Blunts’ remaining state law claims, which the Blunts\nformally opposed on August 29, 2008. J.A. vol. 3, at 561-72,\n575-89. The District Court issued a Memorandum and Order on\nNovember 18, 2008, (the “November 18, 2008 Order”), in\nwhich it noted that the motion incorrectly had been styled as a\nmotion for partial judgment on the pleadings, when it was really\na motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The\nCourt granted the motion,22 finding that it did not have\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the Blunts’ state law claims and\n22\n   The District Court noted that there was little overlap of the\noperative facts of Amber Blunt’s claims with the claims of the\nother plaintiffs, as the claims involved different time periods,\ndifferent treatment, and possibly different schools. J.A. vol. 3,\nat 602. In this regard, the Court noted that “each of the student-\nplaintiffs presents an entirely different factual predicate for his\nor her claims.” Id. Accordingly, the Court concluded that it\ncould not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Blunts’\nremaining claims, which were based on state law. Id. at 603.\n\n\n                                25\n\fthat there was not a common nucleus of operative fact between\nher claims and those of the other students.23 J.A. vol. 3, at 597.\n\n\n       On December 22, 2008, the remaining plaintiffs moved\nfor class certification. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 64. After\nthe parties briefed the issues, the District Court held a hearing\non the motion on July 21, 2009. Id., Doc. No. 122.24 By an\norder of August 19, 2009, (the “August 19, 2009 Order”), the\nCourt denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification\n(Appellants’ No. 11-4200 br. at 39),25 again dismissed the\n\n23\n  The Blunts have not appealed from the District Court’s ruling\nthat it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their state law\nclaims.\n24\n   The District Court scheduled oral argument on the class\ncertification issue for June 26, 2009, but we are uncertain\nwhether the Court held an argument on that day in addition to\nthe July 21, 2009 argument, or whether argument took place on\nthe second date because the original argument had been\npostponed. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 118.\n25\n   In doing so, the District Court explained that, among other\nrationales for this denial, it had determined that the factual\ncircumstances of potential class members were too disparate to make\nfinal injunctive or declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a\nwhole. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.60. The Court noted that the disparate\nfactual circumstances of individual students also likely would\noverwhelm the litigation:\n\n       Analysis of whether an African American student with a\n\n                                26\n\fclaims brought by the CBP and the NAACP for lack of standing,\nand found that a prior court-entered settlement agreement\nreached in Gaskin v. Pennsylvania, 389 F. Supp. 2d 628 (E.D.\nPa. 2005), barred all claims against the PDE, which it therefore\ndismissed from the case. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.46-42.69.\n\n        In concluding that CBP lacked standing, the District\nCourt found that it did not have a personal stake in the outcome\nof the litigation, and did not suffer an injury giving it standing.\nRather, “[i]ts injuries [we]re more akin to an abstract,\nideological interest in the litigation as opposed to the necessary\n‘personal stake in the outcome’ of the controversy necessary to\nconfer standing.” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.52. In addition, the Court\nreasoned that CBP did not have standing to bring suit on behalf\nof its members because, according to CBP’s bylaws, it did not\nhave any members. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.53-54; August 19, 2009\nOrder at 9 (“The corporation’s bylaws specifically state ‘the\nCorporation shall have no members.’ In light of this express\nstatement in a formal document governing the conduct of the\n\n\n        disability was deprived of an appropriate education will be\n        highly individualized and dependent upon that particular\n        student’s needs, capabilities, and the IEP in place for that\n        child. These individual determinations, which must be made\n        to determine whether a particular student falls within the class\n        definition and whether such student has a cause of action,\n        weigh against certifying this class.\n\nJ.A. vol. 1, at 42.61.\n\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\fcorporation, we find that it does not have standing to bring suit\non behalf of its members because it has none.”). J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.54.\n\n        The District Court also dismissed the claims against the\nPDE because the settlement agreement that the parties had\nreached in Gaskin barred this action against the PDE. The\nCourt noted that Gaskin was similar to this action, as 12\nstudents with disabilities and 11 disability advocacy groups\nbrought that case against the PDE, among others, pursuant to the\nIDEA, § 504 of the RA, and Title II of the ADA. The Gaskin\nplaintiffs made similar (although not identical) allegations as\nthose in this case, alleging that the defendants failed to provide\ndisabled students the opportunity to participate in regular\neducation classrooms, provided insufficient supplementary aids\nand services, and generally failed to provide them with a free\nappropriate public education (“FAPE”). J.A. vol. 1, at 42.63,\n42.67. Though the Court acknowledged that the Gaskin\ncomplaint had not alleged racial discrimination as “the basis for\nthe improper treatment of those with learning disabilities,” the\nCourt nonetheless held that the causes of action in Gaskin and\nhere arose from the same “common nucleus of operative facts.”\nThe Court therefore concluded that the release included in the\nGaskin settlement agreement, which by its terms was effective\nfor five years from September 19, 2005, to September 19, 2010,\nbarred the claims in this case because the plaintiffs brought this\naction and individual plaintiffs in this action were evaluated and\nidentified as learning disabled during this period. J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.67, 42.68; Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 19:9-22.\nSignificantly, the class of plaintiffs in the Gaskin litigation was\nvery broad and included “all present and future school age\n\n                                28\n\fstudents with disabilities       in   the   Commonwealth       of\nPennsylvania.”26\n\n       On April 5, 2011, the District Court denied a motion by\nLMSD to amend its answer to the plaintiffs’ TAC to include an\nadditional defense based on releases that certain plaintiffs\nsigned after the LMSD filed its answer in this case because the\nCourt believed that the LMSD unreasonably had delayed\nmaking the motion. J.A. vol. 1, at 46-47. LMSD has filed a\ncross-appeal from the order but, as will be seen, this appeal is\nmoot and thus we do not address it.\n\n      The LMSD filed a motion for summary judgment on July\n15, 2011, (No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 159), and it is that\nmotion that has led to the order at the heart of this appeal. The\n26\n   We queried the attorneys for appellees at oral argument as to\nwhether the Gaskin settlement should apply given that the\nplaintiffs in Gaskin brought their claims under the IDEA, ADA\nand RA, and the appellants other than the Blunts were\nadvancing only § 1983 and Title VI claims. Tr. Oral Arg. June\n13, 2013, at 27. However, as noted above, we recently\nindicated in a related case, S.H. v. Lower Merion School\nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), that litigants who\nincorrectly were identified as disabled might be able to bring\nsuit under the ADA and RA, but cannot bring suit under the\nIDEA, as that statute extends only to disabled individuals, not to\nindividuals who incorrectly were identified as disabled. Id. at\n257-58. But regardless of what claims could have been brought\nagainst the PDE, as we explain below the Gaskin settlement bars\nthe claims in this case.\n\n\n                               29\n\fparties filed numerous documents in support of and in\nopposition to the motion for summary judgment. On October 4,\n2011, the District Court held a hearing on the motion, at which\ntime the Court afforded all parties the opportunity to present\ntheir arguments. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. Nos. 174, 183.\n\n        On October 20, 2011, the District Court made three\ndocket entries, two of which were orders and a third which is\nthe memorandum explaining the basis for those orders\n(collectively, the “October 20, 2011 Memorandum and\nJudgment Order”). No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. Nos. 180-82. In the\nOctober 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order, the Court\ndenied plaintiffs’ motion to partially exclude and/or limit the\nreport and testimony of Daniel J. Reschly, Ph.D., a witness for\nthe LMSD, as moot. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 181. The\nCourt’s principal order granted summary judgment to the LMSD\nagainst all remaining plaintiffs in the action. J.A. vol. 1, at 1-39;\nalso available at No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 182. The Court\nheld that the plaintiffs had failed to put forth any evidence from\nwhich a reasonable inference could be drawn that the LMSD\nintentionally segregated the students on the basis of race into\ninferior educational programs in violation of Title VI. J.A. vol.\n1, at 30-32. The Court also held that plaintiffs had failed to\nestablish a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 case for violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as they had not\nestablished that the LMSD had engaged in purposeful\ndiscrimination and had not been deliberately indifferent to\nplaintiffs’ rights. J.A. vol. 1, at 33-34.\n\n       The District Court noted in particular that plaintiffs were\nrequired to “raise at least some reasonable inference that they\n\n\n                                 30\n\fwere placed into classes and offered services by the [LMSD]\ndue to intentional discrimination based on their race and not\nsimply due to errors in evaluation.” The Court concluded that\nplaintiffs had failed to support this inference with sufficient\nevidence, and had not put forth more than a scintilla of evidence\nthat the LMSD had acted with a racially discriminatory purpose\nin identifying them as disabled and placing them in special\neducation courses (regardless of whether this identification was\ncorrect or not). They also failed to identify an official policy or\ncustom that was deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs’ rights.\nJ.A. vol. 1, at 32-36;27 also available at No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc.\nNo. 180.\n\n        On November 18, 2011, the Blunt plaintiffs and the CBP\nfiled a notice of appeal from the District Court’s October 20,\n2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order. J.A. vol. 1, at 40-42.\nIn an attempt to preserve their right to appeal from all of the\nCourt’s dispositive orders, their November 18, 2011 notice of\nappeal stated that “[w]ithout limiting their right to appeal any\nparticular order rendered during District Court proceedings,\nPlaintiffs listed herein specifically appeal the following orders.”\n The notice of appeal then went on to challenge the February 15,\n\n27\n   The District Court correctly observed that the LMSD’s\nawareness (as evidenced by the formation of a committee to\naddress the concerns of African American parents) of an\nachievement gap, between Caucasian and African American\nstudents, and its failure to eliminate that gap were not evidence\nof intentional discrimination or deliberate indifference toward\nAfrican American students.

J.A.\nvol. 1, at 40-42; see also No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 186.\n\n        Also on November 18, 2011, plaintiffs Linda Johnson,\nLydia Johnson, Durrell/Hall, Dudley/Whiteman, Allston,\nColeman, and Muse/Griffin filed an appeal generally from the\nDistrict Court’s October 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment\nOrder. Their notice of appeal specifically cited the District\nCourt’s order of August 19, 2009, in which the Court dismissed\nthe claims against defendant PDE, an order of October 20, 2011,\nentering the summary judgment in favor of LMSD, and an order\nof October 20, 2011, denying as moot plaintiffs’ motion to\npreclude expert testimony. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 187.\n\n       On December 1, 2011, LMSD filed a cross-appeal from\nthe portion of the District Court’s February 15, 2008 Order\nwhich denied LMSD’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ Title VI\nclaims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies28 and, as\nwe have indicated, the District Court’s April 5, 2011 denial of\n28\n  As explained above, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs’\nIDEA, RA and ADA claims against LMSD, other than those of\nthe Blunts, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but\nhad found that Title VI relief was not available through the\nadministrative process set up for resolving IDEA disputes, and\nthus it did not dismiss the Title VI claims for failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. Of course, the Court similarly did not\ndismiss the § 1983 claims because there were no administrative\nremedies available under that section.\n\n\n                               32\n\fits motion to amend its answer to the TAC.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’\nfederal law claims pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(A),29 28\nU.S.C. § 1331, and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). In addition, the\nplaintiffs claimed that the Court had supplemental jurisdiction\nover their state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. We,\nhowever, do not determine whether the District Court had\njurisdiction over the state law claims because no party contends\nthat the Court erred in not exercising jurisdiction over those\nclaims. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n                     IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        It is well established that we employ a plenary standard\nin reviewing orders entered on motions for summary judgment,\napplying the same standard as the district court. Kelly v.\nBorough of Carlisle, 622 F.3d 248, 253 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing\n\n29\n  “The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction\nof actions brought under this section without regard to the\namount in controversy.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(A).\n\n\n\n\n                                33\n\fGiles v. Kearney, 571 F.3d 318, 322 (3d Cir. 2009)); Albright\nv. Virtue, 273 F.3d 564, 570 (3d Cir. 2001); see also Montone v.\nCity of Jersey City, 709 F.3d 181, 189 (3d Cir. 2013);\nPennsylvania Coal Ass’n v. Babbitt, 63 F.3d 231, 236 (3d Cir.\n1995) (citing Beazer E., Inc. v. United States Envtl. Protection\nAgency, Region III, 963 F.2d 603, 606 (3d Cir. 1992)).\nInasmuch as our review is plenary, “[w]e may affirm the District\nCourt on any grounds supported by the record,” even if the court\ndid not rely on those grounds. Nicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798,\n805 (3d Cir. 2000).30\n\n        In considering an order entered on a motion for summary\njudgment, “we view the underlying facts and all reasonable\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\nopposing the motion.” Babbitt, 63 F.3d at 236. As we also\nhave explained, “[a] factual dispute is material if it bears on an\nessential element of the plaintiff’s claim, and is genuine if a\nreasonable jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party.”\nNatale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility, 318 F.3d 575, 580 (3d\nCir. 2003) (citing Fakete v. Aetna, Inc., 308 F.3d 335, 337 (3d\nCir. 2002) (in turn quoting Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies,\nInc. v. Pa. Milk Mktg. Bd., 298 F.3d 201, 210 (3d Cir. 2002))).\n\n       However, where a non-moving party fails sufficiently to\n\n30\n   We note that sometimes in our opinions we refer to the\nstandard of review on an appeal from an order for summary\njudgment as “plenary” and sometimes as “de novo.” We discern\nno difference between the plenary and de novo standards of\nreview. See 19-206 Pratt, Moore’s Federal Practice – Civil §\n206.04 (2013).\n\n\n                               34\n\festablish the existence of an essential element of its case on\nwhich it bears the burden of proof at trial, there is not a genuine\ndispute with respect to a material fact and thus the moving party\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Lauren W. v.\nDeflaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 266 (3d Cir. 2007). Further, mere\nallegations are insufficient, and “[o]nly evidence sufficient to\nconvince a reasonable factfinder to find all of the elements of\n[the] prima facie case merits consideration beyond the Rule 56\nstage.” Id. (quoting and citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553 (1986) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n        We review a district court’s determinations concerning\nthe admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. See\nMartin v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 223, 232 (3d Cir.\n2001) (“Where a party makes known the substance of the\nevidence it desires to introduce, we review the District Court’s\ndecision to exclude the evidence for an abuse of discretion.”)\n(citing Narin v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 206 F.3d 323, 334 (3d\nCir. 2000)). There is an abuse of discretion if the district court’s\ndecision “‘rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, errant\nconclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.’”\nForrest v. Beloit Corp., 424 F.3d 344, 349 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing\nIn re Merritt Logan, Inc. v. Fleming Cos., Inc, 901 F.2d 349,\n359 (3d Cir. 1990)) (quoting Oddi v. Ford Motor Co., 234 F.3d\n136, 146 (3d Cir. 2000)). “An abuse of discretion can also\noccur ‘when no reasonable person would adopt the district\ncourt’s view.’ We will not interfere with the district court’s\nexercise of discretion ‘unless there is a definite and firm\nconviction that the court below committed a clear error of\njudgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the\n\n                                35\n\frelevant factors.’” Oddi, 234 F.3d at 146 (internal citations\nomitted).31\n\n        It is also well established that we review de novo a\ndistrict court’s determination of a party’s standing to bring suit,\nas a court makes a determination of whether a party has standing\non a legal basis, at least where, as here, the determination does\nnot depend on the court’s resolution of a factual dispute. See\nNational Collegiate Athletic Ass’n v. Governor of N. J., 730\nF.3d 208, 218 (3d Cir. 2013); Common Cause of Pa. v.\nPennsylvania, 558 F.3d 249, 257 (3d Cir. 2009).32\n\n        Judgments of a court applying the IDEA’s statute of\nlimitations but not resolving disputes of fact are subject to\nplenary review as conclusions of law, but “whether [plaintiffs]\nproved an exception to the [IDEA] statute of limitations, and\nwhether the [School] District fulfilled its FAPE obligations . . .\nare subject to clear error review as questions of fact. Such\n[f]actual findings from the administrative proceedings are to be\nconsidered prima facie correct, and if [we] do[ ] not adhere to\n\n31\n  On the other hand, “[t]o the extent an evidentiary issue turns on the\ninterpretation of a Federal Rule of Evidence, rather than the mere\napplication of the rule, our review is plenary.” Forrest, 424 F.3d at\n349 (emphasis added) (citing In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35\nF.3d 717, 749 (3d Cir. 1994)).\n32\n  Citing Taliaferro v. Darby Twp. Zoning Bd., 458 F.3d 181,\n188 (3d Cir. 2006); see also Public Interest Research Grp. of\nN.J., Inc. v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 119 (3d\nCir. 1997).\n\n\n                                  36\n\fthose findings, we must explain why.” D.K. v. Abington Sch.\nDist., 696 F.3d 233, 243 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal citations and\nquotation marks omitted) (citing and quoting P.P. ex. rel.\nMichael P. v. W. Chester Area Sch. Dist., 585 F.3d 727, 734 (3d\nCir. 2009); S.H. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, 336\nF.3d 260, 269-70 (3d Cir. 2003)).\n\n        When a district court reviews an administrative law\njudge’s decision, a court of appeals exercises plenary review\nover the court’s legal conclusions, and reviews its findings of\nfact with a “modified de novo” standard of review (giving the\nadministrative factual findings “due weight” and considering\nthem to be prima facie correct) for clear error. Lauren W., 480\nF.3d at 266. However, we do not make such an analysis here, as\nthe issue before us with respect to the Blunts, the only\nappellants who exhausted their administrative remedies, is\nwhether the District Court correctly dismissed their case on the\ngrounds that they brought it beyond the period allowed by the\nstatute of limitations. The resolution of that issue would not be\naided by administrative expertise.\n\n\n\n           V. ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n\n       Though the District Court made many rulings, the\nappellants have appealed only from some of them. Accordingly,\nwe are able to summarize the issues on this appeal as follows:\n\n       1. Did the District Court correctly dismiss the action\nagainst the PDE on the basis of res judicata (claim preclusion)?\n\n\n                               37\n\f       2. Did the District Court correctly conclude that CBP did\nnot have standing as a plaintiff in this action?\n\n        3. Does the IDEA’s 90-day statute of limitations, in\nwhich a party adversely affected by an administrative\ndetermination of an IDEA claim may bring a state or federal\nsuit, enacted on December 3, 2004, and effective July 1, 2005,\napply to bar the Blunts’ federal action, given that they first\nbegan the administrative judicial process on April 8, 2005, when\nthe IDEA’s statute of limitations for bringing a claim in state or\nfederal court after receiving an adverse administrative\ndetermination was two years, and they received their final\nadverse administrative disposition on August 31, 2005, almost\ntwo months after the new 90-day statute of limitations came into\neffect, and almost nine months after Congress enacted it?33\n\n       4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in how it\n33\n  We note that although the statute of limitations issue was not\ndiscussed at oral argument, the Blunts’ brief raises a challenge\nto the District Court’s ruling on the issue as a prime point of\nargument. Appellants’ br. No. 11-4201 at 31-37. Presumably,\nhowever, in the case of student appellants who no longer are\nclaiming to be disabled, but rather are claiming to have been\nmisidentified as disabled, a statute of limitations issue would be\ninapplicable. However, as far as we can tell from the record, at\nleast one or two of the student plaintiffs do not challenge their\nidentification as disabled, and counsel for the Blunts has not\nwithdrawn the argument regarding the statute of limitations\nwhich thus has been preserved on appeal. Therefore, we\naddress the statute of limitations issue.\n\n\n                               38\n\ftreated certain evidence that plaintiffs offered by not giving it\ngreater weight and not considering the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiffs when the Court considered and\ngranted the motion for summary judgment made by the LMSD\nand, on the other hand, in how it treated certain evidence that\nLMSD offered for consideration on that motion?\n\n       5. Did plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VI and § 1983 such that\nsummary judgment was inappropriate?34\n\n\n\n               VI. SUMMARY OF THE LAW\n\n       A. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n       Congress enacted the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.,\nwith the goal of “improving educational results for children with\ndisabilities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(1). The congressional\nfindings and purposes section of the IDEA is quite broad and\nsets forth in great detail Congress’ intention in adopting the\nIDEA.\n\n       Each public school district in a state that accepts federal\n\n34\n   LMSD argues that the District Court improperly denied its\nmotion to amend its answer. We, however, do not reach that\nissue because our determination that the Court properly granted\nsummary judgment in its favor and our affirmance of the other\norders on appeal are dispositive of the issue.\n\n\n                               39\n\ffunds under IDEA35 has a continuing obligation, called the\n“child find” requirement, to identify and evaluate all students\nreasonably believed to have a disability, and each state receiving\nfunds must establish procedures to effectuate this requirement.\nRidley Sch. Dist. v. M.R., 680 F.3d 260, 271 (3d Cir. 2012). As\nwe pointed out in Ridley, Pennsylvania has set forth child find\nprocedures in 22 Pa. Code §§ 14.121 through 14.125. Id.\n\n        States receiving federal funding for assistance in the\neducation of children with disabilities under the IDEA are\nresponsible for providing a FAPE to any students who are\nidentified as learning disabled until they reach 21 years of age.\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)-(d)); see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.1-\n300.2;36 Jonathan H. v. Souderton Area Sch. Dist., 562 F.3d\n527, 528 (3d Cir. 2009); Lauren W., 480 F.3d at 272. As we\nexplained in Ridley:\n\n35\n    “The IDEA was enacted pursuant to the congressional\nspending power. [Thus, a] state is not generally bound by the\nIDEA unless it receives federal funding under the statute.”\nA.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 341 F.3d 234, 247 (3d Cir.\n2003) (internal citations omitted).\n36\n   “The purposes of this part are-- (a) To ensure that all children\nwith disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public\neducation that emphasizes special education and related services\ndesigned to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further\neducation, employment, and independent living; . . .” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.1(a). Further, “[t]his part applies to each State that\nreceives payments under Part B of the Act, as defined in §\n300.4.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.2(a).\n\n                                40\n\f       A FAPE consists of educational instruction specially\n       designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped\n       child, supported by such services as are necessary to\n       permit the child to benefit from the instruction.\n       Although a state is not required to maximize the potential\n       of every handicapped child, it must supply an education\n       that provides significant learning and meaningful benefit\n       to the child. [T]he provision of merely more than a\n       trivial educational benefit is insufficient.\n\n680 F.3d at 268 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 3050\n(1982); Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., 172 F.3d 238, 247 (3d\nCir. 1999); L.E. v. Ramsey Bd. of Educ., 435 F.3d 384, 390 (3d\nCir. 2006)).\n\n        In providing a FAPE to a disabled student, school\ndistricts must work with the student’s parents to create an\nindividualized education plan (“IEP”), containing certain\nelements that the Code of Federal Regulations specifies must be\nmade available to each disabled student. We have explained the\nbalance between reasonable goals for the IEP and a parent’s\nfondest hopes for the parent’s child as follows:\n\n       Under the IDEA, school districts must work with parents\n       to design an IEP, which is a program of individualized\n       instruction for each special education student. ‘Each IEP\n       must include an assessment of the child’s current\n       educational performance, must articulate measurable\n       educational goals, and must specify the nature of the\n       special services that the school will provide.’ Although\n       the IEP must provide the student with a ‘basic floor of\n\n                               41\n\f       opportunity,’ it does not have to provide ‘the optimal\n       level of services,’ or incorporate every program\n       requested by the child’s parents. . . . [T]he IDEA\n       guarantees to a disabled child ‘an education that is\n       appropriate, not one that provides everything that might\n       be thought desirable by loving parents’ . . . . ‘[A]t a\n       minimum, the IEP must be reasonably calculated to\n       enable the child to receive meaningful educational\n       benefits in light of the student’s intellectual potential,’\n       and ‘individual abilities.’\n\nRidley, 680 F.3d at 276 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Congress amended the IDEA through the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Improvement Act of 2004 to require that an\nIEP include “a statement of the special education and related\nservices and supplementary aids and services, based on peer-\nreviewed research to the extent practicable, to be provided to the\nchild.” Ridley, 680 F.3d at 276 (emphasis in original) (quoting\nand citing 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)). Because neither\nthe text of the IDEA nor the regulations promulgated under it\nprovided guidance regarding the peer-review research provision,\nwe looked to the agency’s interpretation of its own regulations\nfor guidance, and determined (1) that although schools should\nstrive to base a student’s IEP on peer-reviewed research to the\nmaximum extent possible, the student’s IEP team must be\nallowed to be flexible in devising an appropriate program for\nany particular student in light of the available research; and (2)\ncourts must accord significant deference to the choices made by\nschool officials as to what constitutes an appropriate program\n\n\n\n                               42\n\ffor each student.37 Ridley, 680 F.3d at 277 (citing 71 Fed. Reg.\nat 46,665 (2006); D.S., 602 F.3d at 556-57; Ridgewood, 172\nF.3d at 247).\n\n           B. Redress and the Statute of Limitations\n           under the IDEA\n\n       “If parents believe that an IEP fails to provide their\nchild with a FAPE, they may request an administrative\n37\n  We explained that “[g]iven that the IDEA does not require an\nIEP to provide the ‘optimal level of services,’ we likewise hold\nthat the IDEA does not require a school district to choose the\nprogram supported by the optimal level of peer-reviewed\nresearch. Rather, the peer-review specially designed instruction\nin an IEP must be ‘reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive meaningful educational benefits in light of the student’s\nintellectual potential.’” Ridley, 680 F.3d at 277 (citing\nChambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176,\n182 (3d Cir. 2009)). While we recognized that “there may be\ncases in which the specially designed instruction proposed by a\nschool district is so at odds with current research that it\nconstitutes a denial of a FAPE,” and that “if it is practicable for\na school district to implement a program based upon peer-\nreviewed research, and the school fails to do so, that will weigh\nheavily against a finding that the school provided a FAPE,”\nnonetheless we declined to set a bright-line rule as to what\nconstitutes an adequately peer-reviewed special education\nprogram, and emphasized that the appropriateness of an IEP\nmust be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account\nthe available research. Id. at 279.\n\n\n                                43\n\f‘impartial due process hearing,’” as may a school district if it\nwants to change an existing IEP or seeks an evaluation without\nthe parents’ consent. Ridley, 680 F.3d at 269-70 (citing 20\nU.S.C. § 1415(f); Schaffer, 546 U.S. at 53, 126 S.Ct. at 532).\n\n       The burden of persuasion in an administrative hearing\nunder the IDEA lies with the party seeking relief. See Schaffer,\n546 U.S. at 62, 126 S.Ct. at 537. Similarly, the party judicially\nchallenging an administrative decision bears the burden of\npersuasion with respect to the finding for each claim challenged.\n Ridley, 680 F.3d at 270.\n\n        On December 3, 2004, Congress revised the IDEA with\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act of 2004,\nwhich included a two-year statute of limitations governing the\ntime during which an aggrieved party may file a request for an\nadministrative due process hearing under the IDEA. P.L. 108-\n446, 118 Stat. 2647 (2004); 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(c). The two-\nyear period runs from the date that the parent knew or should\nhave known about the alleged action that forms the basis for the\ncomplaint. The same two-year statute of limitations for bringing\nadministrative claims also applies to other legal claims premised\non the IDEA, such as claims under § 504 of the RA, or claims\n“invoking Child Find and FAPE duties.” D.K., 696 F.3d at 244\n(quoting P.P. ex. rel. Michael P., 585 F.3d at 734). In the same\nlegislation, Congress shortened the statute of limitations to 90\ndays for a party dissatisfied with the result of the administrative\nproceedings to bring a federal or state judicial action to\nchallenge that result. Though Congress mandated that these\nnew statutes of limitations were to be retroactive, it delayed\ntheir effective dates until July 1, 2005.\n\n\n                                44\n\f        In 2010, we determined that the seven-month “grace\nperiod” between the enactment of the two-year statute of\nlimitations and its effective date provided litigants with\nreasonable notice and opportunity to bring claims, so that it was\nnot unfair to impose the new statute of limitations and thus the\nperiod that the limitations period allowed was not impermissibly\nshort. Steven I. v. Cent. Bucks Sch. Dist., 618 F.3d 411, 415-16\n(3d Cir. 2010).38 We further explained that “all persons are\ncharged with knowledge of the provisions of statutes and must\ntake note of the procedure adopted by them, [and] a legislature\nneed do nothing more than enact and publish the law, and afford\nthe citizenry a reasonable opportunity to familiarize itself with\nits terms and to comply.” Id. at 416 (internal citations and\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, we noted that the Supreme\n\n38\n     In so doing, we cited a Supreme Court decision reciting that\n\n         [t]his court has often decided that statutes of limitation\n         affecting existing rights are not unconstitutional, if a\n         reasonable time is given for the commencement of an\n         action before the bar takes effect.\n\n         It is difficult to see why, if the legislature may prescribe\n         a limitation where none existed before, it may not change\n         one which has already been established. The parties to a\n         contract have no more a vested interest in a particular\n         limitation which has been fixed than they have in an\n         unrestricted right to sue.\n\nWilson v. Iseminger, 185 U.S. 55, 63, 22 S.Ct. 573, 575 (1902)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                 45\n\fCourt\n\n        has upheld retroactive adjustments to a limitations period\n        only when the legislature has provided a grace period\n        during which the potential plaintiff could reasonably be\n        expected to learn of the change in the law and then\n        initiate his action. In the context of a retrospective\n        statute of limitations, a reasonable grace period provides\n        an adequate guarantee of fairness. Having suffered the\n        triggering event of an injury, a potential plaintiff is likely\n        to possess a heightened alertness to the possibly\n        changing requirements of the law bearing on his claim.\n\nId. at 417 (quoting Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516, 549, 102\nS.Ct. 781, 802 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n        An IDEA claimant’s right to redress does not end with\nthe administrative review process, for any aggrieved party who\nreceived an adverse administrative determination regarding his\nor her complaints with respect to IDEA compliance may bring\nan action in a “[s]tate court of competent jurisdiction or in a\ndistrict court of the United States, without regard to the amount\nin controversy,” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A), within 90 days of\nthe final administrative decision, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B). 39\nPrior to the amendment of the IDEA shortening the limitations\nperiod, the time for bringing suit in a state or federal court after\nreceiving an adverse administrative determination had been two\n\n39\n  But an action may be brought in a state with “an explicit time\nlimitation for bringing such an action . . . in such time as the\nState law allows.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B).\n\n\n                                 46\n\fyears. The amendment adopting the 90-day statute of\nlimitations passed by Congress on December 3, 2004, became\neffective July 1, 2005, seven months after its enactment. This\n90-day statute of limitations period begins running on “the date\nof the decision of the [administrative] hearing officer.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B); see also Jonathan H., 562 F.3d at 530\n(“Section 1415(i)(2)(B) limits a party’s right to ‘bring an action’\nto within 90 days after the final administrative decision.”).\n\n       As with ADA claims, a party seeking redress under the\nIDEA must exhaust administrative remedies before filing an\naction seeking redress in a state or federal court. See Komninos\nby Komninos v. Upper Saddle River Bd. of Educ., 13 F.3d 775,\n778 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992,\n1011-12, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 3468-69 (1984)); see also I.M. ex rel.\nC.C. v. Northampton Pub. Schs., 869 F. Supp. 2d 174 (D. Mass.\n2012) (“Plaintiffs’ conceded failure to exhaust their\nadministrative remedies with regard to the ADA-grounded claim\nand/or appeal such a decision within 90 days is fatal to its\npresent viability.”).\n\n       We have explained that the policy of requiring\nexhaustion of administrative remedies is strong but it has some\nvery limited exceptions, namely:\n\n            where exhaustion would be futile or inadequate\n         (see Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 327, 108 S.Ct. 592,\n         606 (1988));\n            where the issue presented is a purely legal\n         question;\n\n\n\n                                47\n\f              where the administrative agency cannot grant\n           relief (for example, due to lack of authority); and\n              an emergency situation, such as where exhaustion\n           of administrative remedies would cause ‘severe or\n           irreparable harm’ to the litigant.\n\nKomninos, 13 F.3d at 778-79.40\n\n       Nonetheless, we have cautioned that “[t]he advantages of\nawaiting completions of the administrative hearings are\nparticularly weighty in Disabilities Education Act cases. That\nprocess offers an opportunity for state and local agencies to\nexercise discretion and expertise in fields in which they have\nsubstantial experience. . . . [Therefore], courts should be wary\nof foregoing the benefits to be derived from a thorough\ndevelopment of the issues in the administrative proceeding.” Id.\nat 779-80. We have explained that “the IDEA provides a\ncomprehensive remedial scheme” and “includes a judicial\nremedy for violations of any right ‘relating to the identification,\nevaluation, or educational placement of [a] child, or the\nprovision of a free appropriate public education to such child.’”\n A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 803 (3d Cir.\n2007) (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6)).41\n\n40\n     Citing, inter alia, Honig, 484 U.S. at 327, 108 S.Ct. at 606.\n41\n  In A.W. we further noted that “[b]y preserving rights and\nremedies ‘under the Constitution,’ section 1415(l) does permit\nplaintiffs to resort to section 1983 for constitutional violations,\nnotwithstanding the similarity of such claims to those stated\ndirectly under IDEA. But section 1415(l) does not permit\n\n                                 48\n\f           C. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n        Title VI of the Civil Rights Act provides that “[n]o\nperson in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d. Title VI further provides, in relevant part, that the\nguidelines and criteria established by Title VI “dealing with\nconditions of segregation by race, whether de jure or de facto, in\nthe schools of the local educational agencies of any State shall\nbe applied uniformly in all regions of the United States . . .\nwhatever the origin or cause of such segregation.” 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d-6(a).\n\n\nplaintiffs to sue under section 1983 for an IDEA violation,\nwhich is statutory in nature. Nothing in section 1415(l)\noverrules the Court’s decision in Smith [v. Robinson, 468 U.S.\n992, 104 S.Ct. 3457 (1984)], to the extent it held that Congress\nintended IDEA to provide the sole remedies for violations of\nthat same statute. . . . Indeed . . . the Court has continued to\nrefer to the IDEA as an example of a statutory enforcement\nscheme that precludes a § 1983 remedy.” A.W., 486 F.3d at\n798-803 (emphasis added). Thus, we note that for the five or\nsix student plaintiffs who have changed their theory of liability\nand now argue that the LMSD incorrectly identified them as\ndisabled, this part of the analysis presumably would not apply,\nas they no longer make claims under the IDEA. However, as we\npreviously have noted, appellants did challenge the District\nCourt’s determination on this issue in the briefs in No. 11-4201.\n\n\n                                49\n\f       The application of Title VI to recipients of federal\nassistance through the Department of Education, as explained in\nthe Code of Federal Regulations is especially germane to this\ncase:\n\n      (a) General. No person in the United States shall, on the\n      ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded\n      from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n      otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program\n      to which this part applies.\n\n      (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.\n\n          (1) A recipient under any program to which this part\n          applies may not, directly or through contractual or\n          other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or\n          national origin:\n\n             (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid,\n             or other benefit provided under the program;\n\n             (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other\n             benefit to an individual which is different, or is\n             provided in a different manner, from that\n             provided to others under the program;\n\n             (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or\n             separate treatment in any matter related to his\n             receipt of any service, financial aid, or other\n             benefit under the program;\n\n              (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the\n\n                              50\n\f               enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed\n               by others receiving any service, financial aid, or\n               other benefit under the program;\n\n               (v) Treat an individual differently from others in\n               determining whether he satisfies any admission,\n               enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or\n               other requirement or condition which individuals\n               must meet in order to be provided any service,\n               financial aid, or other benefit provided under the\n               program;\n\n       ...\n\n34 C.F.R. § 100.3(a), (b)(1)(i)-(b)(1)(v).\n\n        Private individuals who bring suits under Title VI may\nnot recover compensatory relief unless they show that the\ndefendant engaged in intentional discrimination. Guardians\nAssoc. v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of N.Y., 463 U.S. 582, 597, 607,\n103 S.Ct. 3221, 3230, 3235 (1983); see also Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 1517-18\n(2001) (reaffirming that private individuals cannot recover\ncompensatory damages under Title VI except in cases of\nintentional discrimination). Recently, we held that plaintiffs\nbringing claims under the ADA and RA may establish\nintentional discrimination with a showing of deliberate\nindifference. S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248,\n263 (3d Cir. 2013). Given the parallels between Title VI and\nthe statutes at issue in S.H., our rationale for adopting deliberate\nindifference as a form of intentional discrimination in S.H.\napplies with equal force in the Title VI context. We explained\n\n                                51\n\fthat the deliberate indifference standard was “better suited to the\nremedial goals of the RA and the ADA,” id. at 264, which is\nalso true for Title VI given that the remedies available for\nviolations of Title VI are coextensive with those available under\nthe ADA and the RA, Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185,\n122 S.Ct. 2097, 2100 (2002).\n\n        Other courts of appeals to have considered the issue\nagree that deliberate indifference may, in certain circumstances,\nestablish intentional discrimination for the purposes of a Title\nVI claim. See, e.g., Zeno v. Pine Plains Cent. Sch. Dist., 702\nF.3d 655, 664-65 (2d Cir. 2012) (explaining that deliberate\nindifference to teacher or peer harassment of individual may\ncreate liability if a plaintiff establishes “(1) substantial control,\n(2) severe and discriminatory harassment, (3) actual knowledge,\nand (4) deliberate indifference”); Bryant v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No.\nI-38 of Garvin Cnty., Ok., 334 F.3d 928, 934 (10th Cir. 2003)\n(holding that “deliberate indifference to known instances of\nstudent-on-student racial harassment is a viable theory in a Title\nVI intentional discrimination suit”); Monteiro v. Tempe Union\nHigh Sch. Dist., 158 F.3d 1022, 1033 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding\nthat school district may violate Title VI if there is a racially\nhostile environment, the district had notice of the problem, and\nit failed to respond adequately). The Supreme Court, addressing\nclaims under Title IX, explained that in order to establish\ndeliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that the school\ndistrict had knowledge of the alleged misconduct and the power\nto correct it but nonetheless failed to do so. See Davis v.\nMonroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 645-49, 119 S.Ct.\n1661, 1672-74; S.H., 729 F.3d at 265. Constructive knowledge\nis not sufficient; “only actual knowledge is a predicate to\n\n                                 52\n\fliability.” Zeno, 702 F.3d at 666.\n\n       D. 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1983 states, in relevant part:\n\n       Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\n       regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or\n       the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be\n       subjected, any citizen of the United States or other\n       person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation\n       of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\n       Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured\n       in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\n       proceeding for redress . . .\n\n      To establish a § 1983 claim, a plaintiff must prove that a\ndefendant’s discriminatory action was purposeful:\n\n       To bring a successful claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for a\n       denial of equal protection, plaintiffs must prove the\n       existence of purposeful discrimination. They must\n       demonstrate that they ‘receiv[ed] different treatment\n       from that received by other individuals similarly\n       situated.’\n\nAndrews v. City of Phila., 895 F.2d 1469, 1478 (3d Cir. 1990)\n(internal citations omitted). We further explained in Brown v.\nCity of Pittsburgh, 586 F.3d 263, 293 (3d Cir. 2009):\n\n       Our analysis yields the following conclusion: in\n       order to establish municipal liability for selective\n\n                               53\n\f       enforcement of a facially viewpoint- and content-\n       neutral regulation, a plaintiff whose evidence\n       consists solely of the incidents of enforcement\n       themselves must establish a pattern of\n       enforcement activity evincing a governmental\n       policy or custom of intentional discrimination on\n       the basis of viewpoint or content.\n\n        We also have explained that “[a]n essential element of a\nclaim of selective treatment under the Equal Protection Clause is\nthat the comparable parties were ‘similarly situated.’ Persons\nare similarly situated under the Equal Protection Clause when\nthey are alike ‘in all relevant aspects.’” Startzell v. City of\nPhila., 533 F.3d 183, 203 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Hill v. City of\nScranton, 411 F.3d 118, 125 (3d Cir. 2005)).\n\n          E. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and\n          Relevant Regulations of the Department of\n          Education\n\n       Section 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., states, in\nrelevant part:\n\n       No otherwise qualified individual with a disability\n       in the United States, . . . shall, solely by reason of\n       her or his disability, be excluded from the\n       participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n       subjected to discrimination under any program or\n       activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Thus, § 504 of the RA requires school\ndistricts receiving federal funding to provide a FAPE to each\n\n                                54\n\fqualified handicapped person within the recipient’s jurisdiction.\n See Lauren W., 480 F.3d at 274; see also Ridley, 680 F.3d at\n280 (quoting W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 492 (3d Cir. 1995),\nabrogated on other grounds by A.W., 486 F.3d 791); 34 C.F.R.\n§ 104.33(a)-(b).42 We have explained that this means “a school\n\n42\n     34 C.F.R. § 104.33 provides:\n\n      (a) General. A recipient that operates a public elementary or\n      secondary education program or activity shall provide a free\n      appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped\n      person who is in the recipient’s jurisdiction, regardless of the\n      nature or severity of the person’s handicap.\n\n      (b) Appropriate education.\n\n        (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the provision of an\n        appropriate education is the provision of regular or special\n        education and related aids and services that (i) are\n        designed to meet individual educational needs of\n        handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of\n        nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are based upon\n        adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of\n        §§ 104.34, 104.35, and 104.36.\n\n        (2) Implementation of an Individualized Education\n        Program developed in accordance with the Education of\n        the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the\n        standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.\n\n        (3) A recipient may place a handicapped person or refer\n        such a person for aid, benefits, or services other than\n\n                                   55\n\fdistrict must reasonably accommodate the needs of the\nhandicapped child so as to ensure meaningful participation in\neducational activities and meaningful access to educational\nbenefits. . . . However, § 504 does not mandate ‘substantial’\nchanges to the school’s programs, and courts ‘should be mindful\nof the need to strike a balance between the rights of the student\nand [his or her] parents and the legitimate financial and\nadministrative concerns of the [s]chool [d]istrict.’” Ridley, 680\nF.3d at 280-81 (internal citation omitted); Ridgewood, 172 F.3d\nat 247; Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 405,\n99 S.Ct. 2361, 2366 (1979). On the other hand, mere\nadministrative or fiscal convenience does not constitute a\nsufficient justification for providing separate or different\nservices to a handicapped child. Ridley, 680 F.3d at 281 (citing\nHelen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 338 (3d Cir. 1995)).\n\n       To establish that there has been a violation of § 504 of\nthe RA, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the student was\ndisabled;43 (2) (s)he was “otherwise qualified” to participate in\n\n      those that it operates or provides as its means of carrying\n      out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient\n      remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements of\n      this subpart are met with respect to any handicapped\n      person so placed or referred.\n43\n   Again, as noted, a recent psychological evaluation of the\nstudents in question, performed by plaintiffs’ psychologist at\ntheir behest, has concluded that five or six of the students at\nissue are not learning disabled, and thus a § 504 analysis\npresumably is not relevant to those students’ claims.\n\n\n                               56\n\fschool activities; (3) the school district received federal financial\nassistance; and (4) the student was excluded from participation\nin or denied the benefits of the educational program receiving\nthe funds, or was subject to discrimination under the program.\nSee id. at 280.\n\n           F. Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n       In a provision similar to the safeguards we have\noutlined above, Title II of the ADA provides, in relevant\npart:\n\n       Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no\n       qualified individual with a disability shall, by\n       reason of such disability, be excluded from\n       participation in or be denied the benefits of the\n       services, programs, or activities of a public entity,\n       or be subjected to discrimination by any such\n       entity.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n\n       The Code of Federal Regulations has effectuated\nthe ADA by mandating that there be equal opportunity in\nbenefits and services for disabled individuals.

Establishing a Prima Facie Case of Racial\n       Discrimination Through Circumstantial Evidence\n\n       Inasmuch as we have recognized that individuals who\nviolate the law based on discriminatory motives sometimes do\nnot leave a trail of direct evidence, but instead “cover their\ntracks” by providing alternate explanations for their actions, we\nhave found that a plaintiff may establish a prima facie factual\nfoundation of discrimination by drawing reasonable inferences\nfrom certain objective facts that are generally not in dispute.\nSee Barnes Found. v. Twp. of Lower Merion, 242 F.3d 151,\n162-63 (3d Cir. 2001).44\n\n        In International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United\nStates, a Title VII employment discrimination case mentioned\n44\n   In Barnes, a case involving a museum with a primarily\nAfrican American board of directors, the plaintiffs’ evidence\nconsisted mainly of affidavits from attorneys expressing their\nviewpoint that zoning enforcement had been unequal with\nrespect to the museum. In this regard, the plaintiffs claimed that\nthere had been unequal treatment of the museum as compared to\nits neighbors in the enforcement of parking regulations.\nMoreover, it was claimed that one resident of the municipality\nin which the museum was located used “code words” at a public\nmeeting in a manner that the plaintiffs believed had racial\nundertones. Nevertheless, we concluded that the evidence\nprovided “a totally inadequate foundation on which to predicate\nan inference that racial animus motivated the appellants,” 242\nF.3d at 164, except perhaps as to the one individual who had\nused the “code words.”\n\n\n                               59\n\fseveral times during oral argument in this case,45 the Supreme\nCourt rejected defendants’ arguments that statistics never can\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination. Rather, the Court\nheld that statistics, when bolstered by other evidence, may,\ndepending on the circumstances, establish a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination. 431 U.S. 324, 338-40, 97 S.Ct. 1843,\n1856-57 (1977). However, the Court cautioned that the\n“usefulness [of statistics] depends on all of the surrounding facts\nand circumstances.” Id. at 340, 97 S.Ct. at 1856-57.\n\n        Importantly, the Supreme Court has explained that\nneither the “courts or defendants [are] obliged to assume that\nplaintiffs’ statistical evidence is reliable,” and has cited, for\nexample, the weaknesses inherent in small or incomplete data\nsets and/or inadequate statistical techniques. Watson v. Fort\n\n45\n   Many of the cases that discuss statistical evidence as it relates\nto establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination do so in\nthe context of employment litigation under Title VII. Though\nwe are not suggesting that a Title VI prima facie case\nnecessarily requires a plaintiff to meet the same burden of proof\nthat a plaintiff must meet in a Title VII case, as we have no need\nto address that possibility, the general discussion of the\nusefulness of statistics as prima facie evidence in Title VII cases\nis instructive. Indeed, we have recognized that “[a]lthough the\nSupreme Court has not yet spoken on the issue, the courts of\nappeals have generally agreed that the parties’ respective\nburdens in a Title VI disparate impact case should follow those\ndeveloped in Title VII cases.” Powell v. Ridge, 189 F.3d 387,\n393 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n\n                                60\n\fWorth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 996, 108 S.Ct. 2777, 2790\n(1988); see also Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 339 n.20, 97 S.Ct. at\n1857 n.20 (“Considerations such as small sample size may, of\ncourse, detract from the value of such evidence.”).\n\n       The Supreme Court also has rejected the use of particular\nstandard deviations or “any alternative mathematical standard”\nin establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination,\nand has stressed that the significance or substantiality of\nnumerical disparities must be judged on a case-by-case basis.\n“[S]uch a case-by-case approach properly reflects our\nrecognition that statistics ‘come in infinite variety and . . . their\nusefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and\ncircumstances.’” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 n.3, 108 S.Ct. at\n2789 n.3 (internal citations omitted). Moreover, the Court has\nnoted that its “formulations, which have never been framed in\nterms of any rigid mathematical formula, have consistently\nstressed that statistical disparities must be sufficiently\nsubstantial that they raise such an inference of causation.” Id. at\n995, 108 S.Ct. at 2789.\n\n           H. Class Actions and Res Judicata (Claim\n           Preclusion) Defenses\n\n                   1. Claim Preclusion\n\n       We have explained that\n\n       [c]laim preclusion, formerly referred to as res judicata,\n       gives dispositive effect to a prior judgment if a particular\n       issue, although not litigated, could have been raised in\n       the earlier proceeding. Claim preclusion requires: (1) a\n\n                                 61\n\f       final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving; (2)\n       the same parties or their privities [sic]; and (3) a\n       subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.\n\nBd. of Trs. of Trucking Emps. of N. Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc. -\nPension Fund v. Centra, 983 F.2d 495, 504 (3d Cir. 1992)\n(citing United States v. Athlone Indus., Inc., 746 F.2d 977, 983\n(3d Cir. 1984)).\n\n       In analyzing whether these three elements have been met,\nwe “[do] not apply this conceptual test mechanically, but focus\non the central purpose of the doctrine, to require a plaintiff to\npresent all claims arising out [of] the same occurrence in a\nsingle suit. In so doing, we avoid piecemeal litigation and\nconserve judicial resources.” Sheridan v. NGK Metals Corp.,\n609 F.3d 239, 260 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Churchill v. Star\nEnters., 183 F.3d 184, 194 (3d Cir. 1999) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)) (in turn quoting Athlone, 746 F.2d at 984).\n\n        We further have explained that “[w]e take a ‘broad view’\nof what constitutes the same cause of action” and that “res\njudicata generally is thought to turn on the essential similarity of\nthe underlying events giving rise to the various legal claims.”\nSheridan, 609 F.3d at 261 (emphasis in original) (citing\nChurchill, 183 F.3d at 194) (quoting Athlone, 746 F.2d at 983-\n84). In analyzing essential similarity, we consider several\nfactors: “(1) whether the acts complained of and the demand for\nrelief are the same . . .; (2) whether the theory of recovery is the\nsame; (3) whether the witnesses and documents necessary at\ntrial are the same . . .; and (4) whether the material facts alleged\nare the same. It is not dispositive that a plaintiff asserts a\ndifferent theory of recovery or seeks different relief in the two\n\n                                62\n\factions.” Id. at 261 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\nDavis v. U.S. Steel Supply, 688 F.2d 166, 171 (3d Cir. 1982));\nsee also Elkadrawy v. Vanguard Grp., 584 F.3d 169, 173 (3d\nCir. 2009) (“This analysis does not depend on the specific legal\ntheory invoked, but rather [on] the essential similarity of the\nunderlying events giving rise to the various legal claims.)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Thus, res judicata bars a claim litigated between the same\nparties or their privies in earlier litigation where the claim arises\nfrom the same set of facts as a claim adjudicated on the merits in\nthe earlier litigation. “Moreover, ‘res judicata bars not only\nclaims that were brought in the previous action, but also claims\nthat could have been brought.’” Id. (internal citations omitted)\n(quoting Davis v. U.S. Steel Supply, 688 F.2d at 171). Further,\n“[t]he fact that several new and discrete discriminatory events\nare alleged does not compel a different result. A claim\nextinguished by res judicata ‘includes all rights of the plaintiff\nto remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part\nof the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of\nwhich the action arose.’” Id. at 174 (emphasis in original)\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24(1) (1982)).\n\n                   2. Application of Res Judicata (Claim\n                      Preclusion) in Class Actions\n\n       We have explained that “[i]t is now settled that a\njudgment pursuant to a class settlement can bar later claims\nbased on the allegations underlying the claims in the settled\nclass action. This is true even though the precluded claim was\nnot presented, and could not have been presented, in the class\naction itself.” In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice\n\n                                 63\n\fLitig., 261 F.3d 355, 366 (3d Cir. 2001). While “it may seem\nanomalous at first glance . . . that courts without jurisdiction to\nhear certain claims have the power to release those claims as\npart of a judgment . . . we have endorsed the rule because it\nserves the important policy interest of judicial economy by\npermitting parties to enter into comprehensive settlements that\nprevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class\naction.” Id. at 366 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\nGrimes v. Vitalink Comm’ns Corp., 17 F.3d 1553, 1563 (3d\nCir.1994)).\n\n       It is highly significant that adding parties to the class in a\nsubsequent class action does not necessarily preclude parties\nfrom satisfying the second prong of the res judicata test, that the\nparties are the same or privies of the parties in the first action.\nSee, e.g., Sheridan, 609 F.3d at 261 (“The fact that there are\nadditional parties in Sheridan II does not affect our\nconclusion.”) (citing Gregory v. Chehi, 843 F.2d 111, 119 (3d\nCir. 1988) (“The essence of the cause of action asserted against\nthe defendants in the state proceeding is not altered by the\naddition of more parties.”)).\n\n           I. Standing\n\n       Article III, § 1 of the Constitution confers judicial power\non the federal courts, but limits their jurisdiction to cases and\ncontroversies “which are appropriately resolved through the\njudicial process.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992) (quoting Whitmore v.\nArkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155, 112 S.Ct. 1717, 1722 (1990)\n(“[T]he core component of standing is an essential and\nunchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of\n\n                                 64\n\fArticle III.”) (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is well\nestablished that plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that\nthey have standing in the action that they have brought. See\nDanvers Motor Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 432 F.3d 286, 291 (3d\nCir. 2005) (citing Storino v. Borough of Point Pleasant Beach,\n322 F.3d 293, 296 (3d Cir. 2003)).\n\n       The Supreme Court has explained that “the irreducible\nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three elements”:\n(1) the invasion of a concrete and particularized legally\nprotected interest and resulting injury in fact that is actual or\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) a causal\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of,\nmeaning that the injury must be fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) it must be likely, as\nopposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed\nby a favorable decision. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at\n2136, 2147 (1992) (citing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727,\n740-41 n.16, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1368-69 n.16 (1972)). See Nat’l\nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 730 F.3d at 218.\n\n       An injury is “concrete” if it is real, or distinct and\npalpable, as opposed to merely abstract, and is sufficiently\nparticularized if “‘it affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and\nindividual way.’” New Jersey Physicians, Inc. v. President of\nthe United States, 653 F.3d 234, 238 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing City\nof L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665\n(1983)) (citing and quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1, 112\nS.Ct. at 2136 n.1). A harm is “actual or imminent” rather than\n“conjectural or hypothetical” where it is presently or actually\noccurring, or is sufficiently imminent. The determination of\n\n\n                               65\n\fwhat is imminent is somewhat elastic, but it is fair to say that\nplaintiffs relying on claims of imminent harm must demonstrate\nthat they face a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury from\nthe conduct of which they complain. Id. (citing Babbitt v.\nUnited Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298, 99 S.Ct.\n2301, 2308 (1979)).\n\n        In the context of a motion to dismiss, we have held that\nthe “[i]njury-in-fact element is not Mount Everest. The contours\nof the injury-in-fact requirement, while not precisely defined,\nare very generous, requiring only that claimant allege [ ] some\nspecific, identifiable trifle of injury.” Danvers Motor Co., 432\nF.3d at 294 (quoting Bowman v. Wilson, 672 F.2d 1145, 1151\n(3d Cir. 1982)).\n\n       The Supreme Court explained the difference in the\nburden placed on the plaintiff to satisfy the standing requirement\nat the motion to dismiss stage as compared to the motion for\nsummary judgment stage, as follows:\n\n       At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of\n       injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may\n       suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we ‘presum[e] that\n       general allegations embrace those specific facts that are\n       necessary to support the claim.’ In response to a\n       summary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no\n       longer rest on such ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set\n       forth’ by affidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts,’ Fed.\n       Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e), which for purposes of the\n       summary judgment motion will be taken to be true. And\n       at the final stage, those facts (if controverted) must be\n       ‘supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.’\n\n                                66\n\fLujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. at 2137 (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n       The Court further has noted that:\n\n       ‘Beyond the constitutional requirements, the federal\n       judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential\n       principles that bear on the question of standing.’ One of\n       these is the requirement that the plaintiff ‘establish that\n       the injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the\n       adverse effect upon him) falls within the “zone of\n       interests” sought to be protected by the statut[e] [or\n       constitutional guarantee] whose violation forms the legal\n       basis for his complaint.’ The ‘zone-of-interests’\n       formulation first appeared in cases brought under § 10 of\n       the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702, but\n       we have subsequently made clear that the same test\n       similarly governs claims under the Constitution in\n       general. Indeed, we have indicated that it is more strictly\n       applied when a plaintiff is proceeding under a\n       ‘constitutional . . . provision’ . . .\n\nWyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 468-69, 112 S.Ct. 789,\n807-08 (1992) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\n\n        An organization or association may have standing to\nbring a claim where (1) the organization itself has suffered\ninjury to the rights and/or immunities it enjoys; or (2) where it is\nasserting claims on behalf of its members and those individual\nmembers have standing to bring those claims themselves. See\nCommon Cause of Pa., 558 F.3d at 261. Where an organization\nasserts its standing to sue on its own behalf, “a mere ‘interest in\n\n                                67\n\fa problem,’ no matter how longstanding the interest and no\nmatter how qualified the organization is in evaluating the\nproblem, is not sufficient by itself to render the organization\n‘adversely affected’ or ‘aggrieved.’” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405\nU.S. at 739, 92 S.Ct. at 1368; see also Pennsylvania Prison Soc.\nv. Cortes, 508 F.3d 156, 162 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\n       Where an organization is asserting that it has standing on\nbehalf of its members, it is claiming that it has “representational\nstanding.” There are three requirements for this type of\nstanding:\n\n        (1) the organization’s members must have standing to\n       sue on their own; (2) the interests the organization seeks\n       to protect are germane to its purpose, and (3) neither the\n       claim asserted nor the relief requested requires individual\n       participation by its members.\n\nPennsylvania Prison Soc., 508 F.3d at 163 n.10 (citing Hunt v.\nWash. State Apple Adver. Com’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct.\n2434, 2441 (1977)); see also Public Interest Research Grp. of\nN.J., Inc. v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 119 (3d\nCir. 1997).\n\n         Regarding the first prong, we have explained that “[t]he\nSupreme Court has repeatedly held that generalized grievances\nshared by the public at large do not provide individual plaintiffs\nwith standing,” and further that “the right to have the\ngovernment act in accordance with the law [is] insufficient, by\nitself, to support standing.” Id. at 120. Rather, the plaintiff\norganization must “make specific allegations establishing that at\nleast one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.”\n\n                                68\n\f Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498, 129 S.Ct.\n1142, 1151 (2009).\n\n       We also have rejected the “formalistic argument” that an\norganization necessarily lacks standing “because [its] charter\nprohibits [it] from having members,” but rather in some cases\nhave relied upon “indicia of membership” in analyzing an\norganization’s standing. See Public Interest Research Grp., 123\nF.3d at 119 (citing Hunt, 432 U.S. at 334, 97 S.Ct. at 2436-\n37).46 But we also have held that a plaintiff by making\nexpenditures to advance litigation does not suffer sufficient\ndamage to support standing. Fair Hous. Council of Suburban\nPhila. v. Montgomery Newspapers, 141 F.3d 71, 79 (3d Cir.\n1998).47\n\n       Finally, “‘the jurisdictional issue of standing can be\n\n46\n   In Hunt, the Supreme Court held that “it would exalt form\nover substance to differentiate” between the Washington State\nApple Advertising Commission, which represented the interests\nof all apple growers and suppliers, whose membership in the\nState of Washington was mandatory and who paid dues and\ndirectly benefitted economically from the Commission’s\nactivities, and a traditional trade organization.\n47\n    Other courts of appeals “have, however, adopted different\nviews of whether the injury necessary to establish standing\nflows automatically from the expenses associated with\nlitigation.” But we have aligned “ourselves with those courts\nholding that litigation expenses alone do not constitute damage\nsufficient to support standing.” Fair Hous., 141 F.3d at 78-79.\n\n\n                              69\n\fraised at any time,’” by either a party or by the court. See\nCenter For Biological Diversity v. Kempthorne, 588 F.3d 701,\n707 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Viltrakis, 108 F.3d\n1159, 1160 (9th Cir. 1997)) (citing Summers, 555 U.S. 488, 129\nS.Ct. 1142); see also Steele v. Blackman, 236 F.3d 130, 134 n.4\n(3d Cir. 2001) (“Although Appellees do not address standing,\nwe are required to raise issues of standing sua sponte if such\nissues exist.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is hardly\nsurprising that we have this obligation inasmuch as “federal\nappellate courts have a bedrock obligation to examine both their\nown subject matter jurisdiction and that of the district courts\n[,and] . . . standing is ‘perhaps the most important’ of\njurisdictional doctrines.” Public Interest Research Grp., 123\nF.3d at 117 (citing FW/PBS Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215,\n230-31, 110 S.Ct. 596, 607 (1990); Chabal v. Reagan, 822 F.2d\n349, 355 (3d Cir. 1987)).\n\n\n\n                       VII. ANALYSIS\n\n        Now that we have set forth the procedural history, facts,\nand applicable law in this case we directly address the issues\nraised in this appeal. We first will discuss whether the District\nCourt correctly determined that the Gaskin settlement and final\nadjudication barred the claims against the PDE. Then we will\ndiscuss whether CBP has standing as a litigant in this case. Our\nthird focus will be on the issue of whether the IDEA’s 90-day\nstatute of limitations bars the Blunt plaintiffs’ claims. Finally,\nwe will discuss whether any of the plaintiffs still in the action\nwhen the LMSD moved for summary judgment established a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination under Title VI and/or\n\n                               70\n\fpresented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the LMSD\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 so that the District\nCourt erroneously entered its October 20, 2011 Memorandum\nand Judgment Order granting summary judgment in favor of the\nLMSD.48 As part of this last issue, we will review for abuse of\ndiscretion the District Court’s determinations in using the\nevidence submitted on the motion for summary judgment.\n\n          A. The Effect of the Gaskin Settlement on the\n          Claims Against the PDE\n\n        We conclude that the District Court correctly held that\nthe Gaskin settlement barred the plaintiffs’ claims against the\nPDE. Although the Gaskin plaintiffs were basing their claims\nagainst the PDE on its alleged supervisory failure and did not\nassert that it engaged in racial discrimination, the Gaskin class\nconsisted of “all school-age students with disabilities in\nPennsylvania who have been denied a free appropriate education\nin regular classrooms with individualized supportive services,\nindividualized instruction, and accommodations they need to\nsucceed in the regular education classroom.” J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.64. The allegations against PDE in this case are strikingly\nsimilar to those made against it in Gaskin. As the District Court\n\n48\n  Although we do not reach this issue with respect to the Blunts\n(as the brief in No. 11-4201 filed on their behalf did not and\ncould not challenge the summary judgment), it is difficult to see\nhow we would have come to a different result if we had done so.\n\n\n\n\n                               71\n\fsummarized:\n\n       As in Gaskin, the plaintiffs here claim that the PDE\n       violated the IDEA by failing to identify children with\n       disabilities and provide needed special education and\n       related services and by failing to provide the plaintiffs\n       and members of the putative class a free, appropriate\n       public education. As in Gaskin, plaintiffs here bring a\n       claim against the PDE under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n       Act.\n\nJ.A. vol. 1, at 42.67.\n\n        We conclude that the claims plaintiffs asserted against\nthe PDE in this case overlap with the claims made in Gaskin.\nThough plaintiffs here advance theories of racial motivation not\nraised in Gaskin, the claims here arise from a “common nucleus\nof operative facts” when compared to the claims in Gaskin:\nnamely LMSD’s failure to provide a FAPE to students by\nmishandling identification and/or testing of students for learning\ndisabilities which resulted in incorrect placements. Thus, the\nrelease entered into in Gaskin bars the claims here against the\nPDE because the Gaskin release covered claims arising between\n2005 and 2010 and included all present and future students with\ndisabilities within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Indeed,\nappellants acknowledge that most, though not all, of the plaintiff\nstudents in this case were evaluated individually and their IEPs\nformulated before the Gaskin settlement. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 19:9-22.\n\n       As explained above, we apply res judicata and claim\npreclusion as a consequence of settlement agreements because\n\n                               72\n\fby doing so we encourage settlements and “serve[ ] the\nimportant policy interest of judicial economy by permitting\nparties to enter into comprehensive settlements that ‘prevent\nrelitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action.’”\nPrudential, 261 F.3d at 366. We see no reason to depart from\nthat policy in this case.\n\n        In considering the res judicata issue we recognize that,\nalthough the Gaskin release was broad,49 there is no suggestion\nin the record that the attorneys who represented the parties in\nGaskin did not negotiate the settlement at arms’ length.\nMoreover, the district court in Gaskin reviewed and accepted the\nsettlement; and the settlement led the parties to forego additional\nlitigation in which they could have advanced their positions with\nthe hope of obtaining what they perceived would be a more\nfavorable outcome than the settlement agreement provided them.\n We agree with the PDE that the claims against it in this case,\nlike those in Gaskin, deal with its alleged failure to monitor\nspecial education programs carried out by school districts in\nPennsylvania, including the procedures regarding testing of\nstudents for special education services and other aspects of the\nprovision of special education services to students entitled to\nthem, and that the settlement covered the period from 2005-\n2010. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 26:12-25.\n\n       We recognize that appellants argue that the District Court\nhere erred in its interpretation of the parties’ intent in entering\ninto the Gaskin settlement agreement. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 21-23. There can be no doubt that, as other courts have\n49\n     See Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 28.1.\n\n\n                                73\n\fheld, “[t]he best evidence of . . . intent is, of course, the\nsettlement agreement itself.” Norfolk S. Corp. v. Chevron,\nU.S.A., Inc., 371 F.3d 1285, 1289 (11th Cir. 2004) (emphasis\nadded); see also Davis v. Huskipower Outdoor Equip. Corp.,\n936 F.2d 193, 196 (5th Cir. 1991) (“[A] settlement agreement is\nan enforceable contract to which a court must give legal effect\naccording to the parties’ intent as expressed in the document.”);\nMiller v.

Moreover, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit explained in Facebook, Inc. v. Pacific Northwest\nSoftware, Inc., 640 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 2011), a\nsettlement agreement may release all claims arising out of the\ntransaction with which the release was concerned even if they\nare not yet known; and broad releases are valid at least when\n\n50\n   “Settlement agreements are regarded as contracts and must be\nconsidered pursuant to general rules of contract interpretation.\nThe fundamental rule in construing a contract is to ascertain and\ngive effect to the intention of the parties. Thus, we will adopt\nan interpretation which, under all circumstances, ascribes the\nmost reasonable, probable, and natural conduct of the parties,\nbearing in mind the objects manifestly to be accomplished.\nAdditionally, if the language appearing in the written agreement\nis clear and unambiguous, the parties’ intent must be discerned\nsolely from the plain meaning of the words used.” Miller, 874\nA.2d at 99 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                               74\n\fnegotiated between sophisticated parties. Overall, we are\nsatisfied from the terms of the Gaskin settlement that it included\nthe claims made against the PDE here, and thus the settlement\nbarred them.51\n\n\n\n\n51\n  We have not overlooked appellants’ argument that the Gaskin\nsettlement could not bar claims that arose after its effective date.\n Rather, we reject that argument because the settlement included\nclaims of “future” students and therefore necessarily it included\nthe claims that arose after its effective date.\n\n\n\n\n                                75\n\f           B. Whether CBP Has Standing in this Suit52\n\n\n52\n   As a matter of convenience this subsection largely is written\nas though for the Court, but in fact this section in its entirety\nrepresents only the views of Judge Greenberg, as Chief Judge\nMcKee and Judge Ambro agree with aspects of the section but,\nas they explain in their separate opinions, not its conclusion that\nCBP does not have standing. Although Judge Ambro, in his\nconcurring opinion, concludes that “CBP has standing to sue on\nits own behalf,” he also observes that “CBP has not explained\nhow, were it permitted to continue as a plaintiff in the case, it\ncould prevail where the individual Plaintiffs have failed.” Chief\nJudge McKee writes that “CBP’s likelihood of success on the\nmerits has no bearing on its standing.” Judge Ambro, however,\ndid not make his observation to support Judge Greenberg’s\nconclusion that CBP does not have standing. Rather, Judge\nAmbro’s point is that, even if CBP has standing, it could not\nsave its case as it could not survive LMSD’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Judge Greenberg agrees that, even if CBP\nhad standing, it would lose on the merits. See infra note 62.\n\n       We note that Chief Judge McKee sets forth that CBP was\ndismissed at an “early stage” of the litigation and did not have\nthe opportunity to engage in discovery. But as we explain\nbelow, the District Court considered the standing issue twice,\nonce in proceedings leading to the February 15, 2008 Order\ndismissing CBP for lack of standing, and again in proceedings\nleading to the August 19, 2009 Order again dismissing CBP for\nlack of standing, and in entering the second order the Court\nconsidered testimony. See infra note 57. Indeed, there was a\n\n                                76\n\f        The District Court dismissed CBP as a plaintiff on its\nown behalf in its February 15, 2008 Order because the Court\nconcluded that CBP had failed to “allege any injury whatsoever”\nto itself beyond advancing evidence that at best insufficiently\ncould support an inference that “the defendants’ conduct may\nhave caused [CBP] . . . to ‘suffer a setback to the\norganization[’s] abstract social interests.’” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.33.\n The Court also determined in its February 15, 2008 Order that\nCBP had not met the three-part test that Hunt v. Washington\nState Apple Advertising Commission indicated needed to be met\nfor an organization to sue on behalf of its members. The CBP\nfailed in this respect because it did not “provid[e] the court with\nthe identity of any member or alleged in the Amended\nComplaint that any of [its] members has suffered an injury[, and\n\ngreat deal of discovery in this case after the Court originally\ndismissed CBP as a party on February 15, 2008, and both this\nopinion and Chief Judge McKee’s opinion refer to this\ndiscovery.\n\n        Judge Ambro and Judge Greenberg see no reason why\nCBP’s participation in the discovery process would have made\nany difference in the outcome of this litigation by somehow\nhaving enabled it to survive the motion for summary judgment if\nit had been directed against it. In this regard, they point out that\nboth groups of plaintiffs had the goal of establishing that LMSD\nhad been violating anti-discrimination and anti-segregation laws\nand regulations and so would have had the same objective in the\ndiscovery process.\n\n\n\n\n                                77\n\fthat w]ithout that information, the court ha[d] no basis to\nconclude that the organization[] ha[s] standing to bring claims\non behalf of [its] members.” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.33-42.34.\nThough CBP’s lack of standing may make no difference with\nrespect to its claims against the PDE inasmuch as the Gaskin\nsettlement may have foreclosed those claims, its claim to have\nstanding raises an issue that must be addressed, for it continues\nto assert claims against the LMSD.53\n\n        CBP has not demonstrated that it suffered an injury to\nitself conferring standing, and, even if its claim is true that it\nhas members notwithstanding its bylaws, CBP does not have\nstanding to sue on their behalf. CBP has a stated purpose to\npromote “equity and excellence in the response of school\ndistricts to the needs of diverse student populations; to address\nissues related to education for populations identified as minority\nand/or African American; and to identify, monitor, and inform\nparents about educational issues impacting disadvantaged\nstudents, their families and the community at large.” J.A. vol. 1,\nat 42.50.\n\n        In its complaint, CBP identified itself as having been\n“operating as an organization in the LMSD for about 13 years,”\nand as “a non-profit Pennsylvania corporation whose purpose is,\ninter alia, to promote equity and excellence in the response of\nschool districts to the needs of diverse student populations; to\n\n53\n  “May have” is used because CBP was not a member of the\nplaintiff class in Gaskin though it might be so regarded to the\nextent that it asserts it has representational standing. This point\nneed not be explored further.\n\n\n                                78\n\faddress issues related to education for populations identified as\nminority and/or African American; and to identify, monitor, and\ninform parents about educational issues impacting\ndisadvantaged students, their families and the community at\nlarge.” No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 1, pp. 23-24; J.A. vol. 2, at\n509. CBP claimed to bring the action “on its behalf and on\nbehalf of its members.” Id. at 25. CBP identified its members\ngenerally as follows: “[t]he members of the organization are\nresidents of the Lower Merion School District and current and\nformer parents or students of the District.” Id. at 510. The\nDistrict Court noted that, notwithstanding these allegations,\nCBP supplied documents that stated that it had no members.\nSee August 19, 2009 Order at 5, No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No.\n123 (“The organization’s bylaws specifically state ‘[t]he\nCorporation shall have no members.’”). Nevertheless, CBP’s\nprohibition in its bylaws against having members does not\nnecessarily mean that it could not have standing as a plaintiff on\nbehalf of its members. If such a determination were predicated\nsolely on the basis of the bylaws, it would advance the strictly\nformalistic approach that we have rejected in other cases. See\nPublic Interest Research Grp., 123 F.3d at 119. Nonetheless,\nthe bylaws do provide context to the overall analysis,\nparticularly in considering whether CBP has attempted to create\nstanding for itself by changing its structure and membership and\nby its expenditure of resources in response to the District\nCourt’s observations concerning its standing.\n\n      In the TAC, the last revised complaint in this case, CBP\ndid not change its statement of purpose quoted above. It,\nhowever, did identify 11 of its members by name, five of whom\nare individually named plaintiffs in this case, and it also\n\n                               79\n\fidentified itself as “support[ing]” several more class members\nand individually named plaintiffs in this case at school-related\nmeetings and court proceedings. TAC, No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc.\nNo. 55, pp. 25-26. CBP also went to great pains to explain the\nrise in its expenditures “over the five years” in relation to this\ncase because, as discussed above, the expenditure of funds by an\norganization on behalf of a cause, though not determinative, is\none factor that may be considered in resolving a standing issue.\nThe CBP’s alleged expenditures on behalf of the interests\nembodied in this case included:\n\n           Use of its resources to ‘host educational\n            consultants and experts’ with the purpose of\n            providing information to the Plaintiffs, class\n            members, community and LMSD;\n           A ‘sharp’ rise in expenditures over the last five\n            years due to its efforts to ‘protect its members\n            from the adverse impact’ of ‘the inferior quality\n            of LMSD’s dual system of education’;\n           Expenditure of resources as a result of its\n            attending meetings related to IEPs, Section 504\n            and ‘disciplinary meetings, court hearings and\n            parent-teacher conferences with and/or on behalf\n            of’ various plaintiffs, CBP members and class\n            members;\n           Its efforts in facilitating a ‘Conciliation\n            Agreement between LMSD and the Pennsylvania\n            Human Relations Commission in which the\n            District promised, inter alia, to eradicate the\n            disproportionate suspension of African American\n            students as compared to White students’;\n\n                               80\n\f           Production of a 45-minute video ‘highlighting the\n            issue of racial inequality’;\n           Making the public aware of ‘racial graffiti and\n            symbols’ which ‘were promulgated at both LMSD\n            high school and middle school buildings’;54\n           Publication of a community newsletter and ‘News\n            Notes . . . to disseminate the compilations of data\n            on’ alleged racial disparities in application of\n            disciplinary measures, segregation by race and\n            ‘under achievement of African American students\n            in the [Lower Merion] District’;\n           The ‘organization’ of educational, career,\n            standardized test, financial aid, and college\n            preparatory seminars.\n\nTAC at 25-26; J.A. vol. 9, at 3871-72.\n\n       Even if all of these expenditures were legitimate, CBP\nhas not established organizational standing. An organization\nmay establish a “concrete and demonstrable injury” sufficient to\nconfer standing if a defendant’s actions “perceptibly impair” the\norganization’s ability to provide services. Havens Realty Corp.\n\n\n\nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-79, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124\n(1982). 55 In Havens, the Supreme Court determined that a\n54\n   It is not clear what these symbols were, who promulgated\nthem, or why the LMSD should be held responsible for them.\nNo. 2:07-cv-3100 Doc. No. 55, p. 26.\n\n\n                               81\n\fnonprofit organization formed to promote equal housing through\ncounseling and referral services had standing to bring an action\ncharging that operators of rental housing units had “steered”\npotential tenants to certain properties based on race. HOME\nalleged that its mission had been frustrated because it had to\ndevote significant resources to identify and counteract the\ndefendants’ racial steering. The Supreme Court held that these\nallegations, if proven, would constitute an injury in fact, and\nthus HOME had standing to sue on its own behalf because the\ndefendants’ practices had impaired its ability to provide\nservices. Id. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124. However, organizations\nmay not satisfy the injury in fact requirement by making\nexpenditures solely for the purpose of litigation, Fair Hous., 141\nF.3d at 75, nor by simply choosing to spend money fixing a\nproblem that otherwise would not affect the organization at all.\nLa Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake\nForest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010). “It must instead\nshow that it would have suffered some other injury if it had not\ndiverted resources to counteracting the problem.” Id.\n       CBP has failed to show how LMSD’s actions have\n\n55\n   We all agree that Havens supplies the correct standard for\ndetermining whether an organization has alleged an injury in\nfact sufficient to confer standing. We disagree, however, about\nwhether CBP’s allegations are sufficient to meet that standard.\nThis disagreement is irrelevant to the resolution of this appeal,\nhowever, inasmuch as Judge Ambro and Judge Greenberg point\nout that CBP has not explained how it could win on the merits.\nThus, even assuming CBP does have organizational standing,\nour ultimate holding would be the same.\n\n\n                               82\n\f“perceptibly impaired” its mission.56 CBP’s very purpose\nrelates to actions directly involving LMSD, and its expenditures\nwere devoted to protecting students’ interests in their\ninteractions with LMSD. In Havens, HOME’s purpose was to\npromote equality in the Richmond area overall and its interests\nthus went far beyond monitoring the specific actions at issue in\nthe Havens case. By contrast, the CBP is targeted only at\nLMSD, so its very purpose was to expend resources to educate\nthe public regarding the LMSD’s behavior. J.A. vol. 2, at 510\n(defining CBP’s membership as residents of LMSD and LMSD\nparents and students). Because it is targeted at LMSD, all of\nCBP’s resources would necessarily have been spent on LMSD-\nrelated projects. CBP has failed to show why this particular\nlitigation has frustrated its mission, or caused a “concrete and\ndemonstrable” injury to its activities. It appears that the alleged\nadditional expenditures were consistent with CBP’s typical\nactivities, and it is thus unclear the effect, if any, that this\nlitigation had on their expenditures. See Fair Hous., 141 F.3d at\n77-78 (refusing to confer standing at summary judgment where\nplaintiff failed to present evidence that it altered its operations\nor diverted resources based on litigation); Havens, 455 U.S. at\n379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124 (explaining that mere “abstract social\ninterests” do not confer standing (citing Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at\n739, 92 S.Ct. at 1368)). CBP simply has not established that the\nLMSD’s actions have frustrated its efforts to fulfill its mission.\n\n\n\n\n56\n   We emphasize that much of what we write with respect to\nstanding reflects the views only of Judge Greenberg.\n\n\n                                83\n\fThus, it has not established standing to sue on its own behalf.57\n\n       CBP also has not established that it has standing to sue\non behalf of its members, if it has any. Hunt v. Washington\nState Apple Advertising Commission is a useful starting point in\nthe consideration of this issue because the Supreme Court\ndiscussed indicia of membership as a means of establishing that\n\n57\n   As we state above, see supra note 52, the District Court\nconsidered the standing issue twice, once in proceedings leading\nto the February 15, 2008 Order dismissing CBP for lack of\nstanding, and again in proceedings leading to the August 19,\n2009 Order again dismissing CBP for lack of standing. This\nlatter consideration included testimony. The dissent parses this\ntestimony in detail, and Judge Greenberg likewise considers it in\nhis analysis. However, a plaintiff may not simply make\nrepeated amendments to a complaint to “fix” the standing issue.\n In this regard, the court’s reasoning in La Asociacion de\nTrabajadores is instructive: “[A plaintiff] may not effectively\namend its [c]omplaint by raising a new theory of standing in its\nresponse to a motion for summary judgment. ‘Simply put,\nsummary judgment is not a procedural second chance to flesh\nout inadequate pleadings.’” 624 F.3d at 1089 (internal citations\nomitted) (quoting Wasco Prods., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc.,\n435 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2006)). This is not to say that a\nplaintiff never can cure a pleading with respect to a standing\nissue in response to a motion for summary judgment challenging\nits standing. Rather, the court of appeals’ comments are\nappropriate in the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n\n                               84\n\fan organization has members. 432 U.S. at 344, 97 S.Ct. at\n2442.\n\n        In Hunt, the Supreme Court determined that a\ncommission created by the State of Washington to represent\nand promote the advertising interests of that State’s apple\ngrowers, whose collective efforts constituted “a multimillion\ndollar enterprise which plays a significant role in Washington’s\neconomy,” had standing to challenge a North Carolina statute\nprohibiting the display of apple grading codes on boxes of\napples shipped to North Carolina. Id. at 336, 97 S.Ct. at 2438.\nThe Washington State apple grading system had been in place\nfor over 60 years, and the stamp reflecting the apple grading was\na selling point for Washington State apples because of the good\nreputation of that State’s apple growing regulations. But due to\nthe structure of the industry, it would have been difficult to pack\nsome apples in unstamped boxes and ensure that they were sent\nto North Carolina, while ensuring that stamped boxes were\nseparated and not shipped to North Carolina. Id. at 337, 97\nS.Ct. at 2438-39. The Supreme Court found that in the\ncircumstances of that case58 the Washington State Apple\nAdvertising Commission had standing to bring the action\nchallenging the North Carolina statute. Id. at 344-45, 97 S.Ct. at\n\n58\n   “Under the circumstances presented here, it would exalt form\nover substance to differentiate between the Washington\nCommission [as a government-mandated organization] and a\ntraditional trade association representing individual growers and\ndealers who collectively form its constituency.” Hunt, 432 U.S.\nat 345, 97 S.Ct. at 2442 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                85\n\f2442. The Court explained that “while the apple growers and\ndealers are not ‘members’ of the Commission in the traditional\ntrade association sense,” because their membership was not\nvoluntary, but rather was required by statute, “they possess[ed]\nall of the indicia of membership in an organization.” Id. at 344,\n97 S.Ct. at 2442.\n\n       In making this determination, the Court noted that only\nWashington State apple growers and dealers could elect the\nmembers of the Commission, and that the growers and dealers\nalone financed its activities, including litigation costs, through\nmandatory assessments levied on them. Id. at 344-45, 97 S.Ct.\nat 2442. The Court found that “[i]n a very real sense, therefore,\nthe Commission represents the State’s growers and dealers and\nprovides the means by which they express their collective views\nand protect their collective interests.” Id. at 345, 97 S.Ct. at\n2442. The Court reasoned that the statutorily-mandated\nparticipation of apple growers and dealers through assessments\ndid not bar the Commission from having standing, analogizing\nthat\n\n       [m]embership in a union, or its equivalent, is often\n       required. Likewise, membership in a bar association,\n       which may also be an agency of the State, is often a\n       prerequisite to the practice of law. Yet in neither\n       instance would it be reasonable to suggest that such an\n       organization lacked standing to assert the claims of its\n       constituents.\n\nId., 97 S.Ct. at 2442.\n\n       Further, the Court noted that the Commission had a\n\n                               86\n\fstrong direct interest in the litigation, because its existence\ndepended on the economic health of the Washington State\napple-growing industry. Moreover, assessments based on the\nvolume of apples grown and packaged provided the\nCommission’s funding and the North Carolina regulation was\nexpected to have a great economic impact on the Washington\nState apple industry. Id., 97 S.Ct. at 2442.\n\n        Though appellants rely heavily on Hunt, Judge\nGreenberg believes that it clearly is distinguishable. CBP is not\nfunded through mandatory assessments of African American\nstudents or their parents residing in the LMSD. Further, CBP’s\nfunding is not tied directly to a clear economic interest which\nwill be affected by the outcome of this litigation. The analogy\nof a traditional trade organization discussed in Hunt is simply\nnot relevant to the CBP’s position in this case. Moreover, in an\nentirely different setting, the Court based its decision in Hunt on\nthe circumstances of that case, including an analysis of how the\nCommission functioned as an organization.59\n\n\n59\n   In support of his contention that CBP has standing, Chief\nJudge McKee indicates that if CBP “can establish both the\ndiscriminatory practices and resultant harm alleged, any\ninjunctive or declaratory relief would surely inure to the benefit\nof African American students and parents in the school district.\nThese students and parents are no more required have to be a\nparty to this suit in order to benefit from the requested relief\nthan the constituents in Hunt were required to be parties to\nbenefit receive the benefits there.” The problem with this\nstatement is that, though it indicates that non-parties may benefit\n\n                                87\n\f         Although appellants amended their complaint after the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of the CBP to name several alleged\nindividual CBP members as plaintiffs, CBP’s organizational\ndocuments state that it does not have members. Moreover, even\nthough appellants also added statements to the complaint\nasserting that the CBP was making expenditures related to this\nsuit after the District Court noted the lack of economic impact of\nthe litigation on CBP, this amendment does not supply the basis\nfor standing. It is clear that a nonprofit entity cannot create\nstanding in a lawsuit in which it has no direct economic interest\nby having its representatives attend meetings regarding the issue\nthat the entity intends to raise in the suit, or by making\nexpenditures to “educate” the public on what it regards as the\nfactual or legal basis for its agenda. As the court said in Center\nfor Law and Education v. United States Department of\nEducation, 315 F. Supp. 2d 15, 24-25 (D.D.C. 2004):\n\n       Without concrete and demonstrable injury to the\n       groups’ activities, however, evidence of a drain\n       on the organizations’ resources does not amount\n       to an injury-in-fact for standing purposes. . . .\n       [A]n organization’s expenses in the pursuit of its\n       agenda are self-effectuating and [claiming them as\n       injury-in-fact] would allow any advocacy group\n       to manufacture standing by choosing to expend\n\n\nfrom any declaratory or injunctive relief that CBP obtains, a\nstanding inquiry addresses the different matter of whether a\nparty can seek that relief. Judge Greenberg believes that CBP\ncannot do so.\n\n\n                               88\n\f       resources to advocate against policy decisions\n       made by the federal government.\n\nOtherwise, the implication would be that any individual or\norganization wishing to be involved in a lawsuit could create a\ncorporation for the purpose of conferring standing, or could\nadopt bylaws so that the corporation expressed an interest in the\nsubject matter of the case, and then spend its way into having\nstanding.\n\n         Fair Housing discussed the artificial creation of standing,\nand cited and quoted with approval a case that noted that “[a]n\norganization cannot, of course, manufacture the injury necessary\nto maintain a suit from its expenditure of resources on that very\nsuit. Were the rule otherwise, any litigant could create injury in\nfact by bringing a case, and Article III would present no real\nlimitation.” Fair Hous., 141 F.3d at 79 (quoting Spann v.\nColonial Vill., Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); see also Kennedy v. Ferguson, 679\nF.3d 998, 1003 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Spann for the proposition\nthat litigation-related costs are not injuries for the purposes of\nassessing an organization’s standing to bring suit on its own\nbehalf); AHF Cmty. Dev., LLC v. City of Dallas, 633 F. Supp.\n2d 287, 194 (N.D. Tex. 2009) (“The Fifth Circuit has held that\nan organization cannot ‘bootstrap standing’ by claiming a drain\non its resources as a result of costs incurred for the particular\nlawsuit in which it asserts standing.”). In City of Philadelphia v.\nBeretta U.S.A., Corp., 126 F. Supp. 2d 882, 897 (E.D. Pa.\n2000), the district court made the following convincing\nstatement with respect to artificial standing:\n\n       It is also disturbing that the organizational\n\n                                89\n\f       plaintiffs argue that they may sue for the costs of\n       educational sessions and other programs which\n       they run to counteract gun violence. By this\n       logic, any social action organization may confer\n       standing upon itself by voluntarily spending\n       money on the social problem of its choice.\n       Analogously, the environmentalist group in Lujan\n       [v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 1112\n       S.Ct. 2130 (1992)] would have standing to protest\n       the endangerment of wildlife in Sri Lanka simply\n       by running programs to preserve foreign fauna.\n       This would be a novel and vast expansion of\n       associational liability for which plaintiffs have\n       advanced no precedential support. It also\n       contradicts the prudential concern behind the\n       standing doctrine that courts not become vehicles\n       for the advancement of ideological and academic\n       agendas.\n\n       In addition to not overcoming the foregoing problems\nwith respect to its standing, CBP does not satisfy the third\nrequirement for an organization to have standing to sue on\nbehalf of its members, namely that neither the claim the\norganization is asserting nor “the relief requested requires the\nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Hunt, 432\nU.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441. Even if the District Court’s\nanalysis regarding CBP’s lack of members and its attenuated\nclaims of injury did not demonstrate that CBP did not have\nstanding, after considering this third criterion it is clear that the\nDistrict Court reached the correct result. It is an accepted\nprinciple that “[b]ecause claims for monetary relief usually\n\n                                 90\n\frequire individual participation, courts have held associations\ncannot generally raise these claims on behalf of their members.”\n Pennsylvania Psychiatric Soc’y v. Green Spring Health Servs.,\nInc., 280 F.3d 278, 284 (3d Cir. 2002).60\n\n       Here, individual student plaintiffs are seeking monetary\nreimbursement for remedial courses that they either already\nhave taken or wish to take, and that they contend were necessary\nbecause of LMSD’s failure to provide them with a FAPE or\n\n60\n   Plaintiffs did seek prospective injunctive relief in the TAC,\nincluding an injunction prohibiting LMSD from placing African\nAmerican students in special education programs “whether or\nnot they have a disability” and forcing the LMSD to identify and\nevaluate African American students who may have been\nimproperly placed in lower-level courses, as well as monitoring\nand training programs for parents and LMSD staff. J.A. 533-34.\n As we discussed below, because the individual plaintiffs are\nparties to the suit, prudential concerns restrict the conferring of\nrepresentational standing on the CBP because the individuals\naffected are capable of litigating their rights on their own behalf.\n Moreover, in Pennsylvania Psychiatric Society, the distinction\nbetween compensatory and injunctive relief was justified by the\nneed for assurance that “the the remedy, if granted, will inure to\nthe benefit of those members of the association actually\ninjured.” 280 F.3d at 284 (quoting Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97\nS.Ct. at 2441). Although the relief would benefit CBP’s\nmembers, the members actually injured are already parties to\nthis suit. It is thus unnecessary for the CBP to have standing to\nvindicate their rights.\n\n\n                                91\n\fLMSD’s incorrect analysis that they were learning disabled.\nAlthough a determination of whether this case should be\ncertified as a class action is no longer an issue in this case, the\nDistrict Court’s explanation of the highly individualized nature\nof these claims is instructive on this last point. It should be\nreadily apparent to anyone reviewing this case that, in view of\nthe complex and varying facts asserted for the individual\nstudents and the myriad legal theories presented in the District\nCourt, the Court was correct in finding that it would have been\ninappropriate to certify this case as a class action. For many of\nthe same reasons, the facts of this case make organizational\nrepresentation of the individual plaintiffs insufficient without\ntheir personal participation in this litigation. After all, the\nparticular aspects of each student’s educational needs, indeed\nthe very individualized character of the application of IEP and\nFAPE to an individual student’s needs, necessarily means that\naddressing the diverse factual assertions in this case would\nrequire individual participation from each student litigant\ninvolved.\n\n       Significantly, the third prong of the Hunt test is\nprudential, not constitutional. See United Food & Commercial\nWorkers Union Local 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544,\n555-56, 116 S.Ct. 1529, 1535-36 (1996). As the Supreme Court\nexplained, this inquiry is designed to ensure that sufficient\nreasons exist to justify departing from the “background\npresumption . . . that litigants may not assert the rights of absent\nthird parties,” and thus focuses on “matters of administrative\nconvenience and efficiency.” Id. at 556, 116 S.Ct. at 1536.\nCBP’s claim to standing is grounded on the claims of its\nmembers—individual students—who are also plaintiffs in the\n\n                                92\n\flawsuit.      Unlike other cases conferring standing on\norganizations, the plaintiffs in this case are not absent. See, e.g.,\nid. (organization suing on behalf of its members); Hunt, 432\nU.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441 (same); Pennsylvania Psychiatric\nSoc’y, 280 F.3d at 280 (same).61 The remedies sought here—\ncompensatory and injunctive—will benefit individual plaintiffs\nthat are already parties to the suit. Permitting the CBP to litigate\nthis case on behalf of its members, when those members are\nalready parties to the lawsuit in their own right, does not fulfill\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance to focus on “administrative\nconvenience and efficiency” in determining prudential standing.\n United Food, 517 U.S. at 557, 116 S.Ct. at 1536.\n\n61\n  The fact that the plaintiffs are parties to the suit distinguishes\nthis case from “‘the long line of cases in which organizations\nhave sued to enforce civil rights’” to which Judge McKee’s\ndissent has referred. It is true that, in many circumstances, an\norganizational plaintiff may be the best (and only) mechanism\nby which discrimination against a large group of individuals\nmay be remedied. However, where—as here—individual\nplaintiffs have brought suit on their own behalf, courts are not\njustified in making an exception to the general rule that third\nparties may not assert their rights. Although, in Powell v.\nRidge, 189 F.3d 391 (3d Cir. 1999), claims for both individual\nand organizational plaintiffs were permitted to proceed, the suit\nchallenged state policy affecting all students in Philadelphia\nschools, a class far larger than the eleven parents who actually\njoined the suit. By contrast, the group at issue here affects a\nmuch smaller set of students who are all capable of joining the\nsuit as individuals or as a class.\n\n                                 93\n\f         As the District Court explained:\n\n         the amount of compensatory education necessary for\n         each named plaintiff and class member would require a\n         highly individualized inquiry into that student’s unique\n         needs, whether those needs were met, the extent to which\n         the School District failed to provide that student with a\n         free, appropriate public education and the proper amount\n         of compensatory education necessary to redress any\n         deficiencies. The individualized analysis of each\n         student’s educational history and needs precludes a\n         finding that a class would be efficiently managed by this\n         court.\n\nAugust 19, 2009 Order at 17, No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 123.\n\n        The District Court’s findings regarding the individualized\nnature of the factual basis for each plaintiff’s claim go directly\nto the third prong for organizational standing, which requires\nthat, for an organization to assert standing on behalf of its\nmembers, their individual participation in the lawsuit must be\nunnecessary. It is very clear that the highly individualized\ncomponents of the plaintiffs’ claims, the complex history of\neach plaintiff’s IEP and evaluations, and the changes in\nunderstanding of his or her disability status, led the Court to\nconclude correctly that the students’ individual participation in\nthis lawsuit was required. Thus, the Court believed that CBP is\nnot an appropriate representational litigant for individual\nstudents and/or their parents.62\n\n\n62\n     Although the District Court’s dismissal of CBP’s claims due\n\n                                94\n\f           C. The Blunts and the 90-day Statute of\n           Limitations under the IDEA, as Revised by the\n           Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act\n           of 2004\n\n        Appellants now argue, contrary to their original\ncontentions in the District Court in their complaint even as\namended, that five or six63 of the individual student plaintiffs do\nnot have a learning disability and the LMSD incorrectly\nidentified them and placed them in special education classes.\nNonetheless, we discuss the IDEA statute of limitations, as\nrevised in 2004, because it appears that the Blunts still seek a\nrecovery under the IDEA based on the contention that Amber\n\nto lack of standing is believed correct by Judge Greenberg, even\nif CBP had standing it would not be successful in this case in\nlight of our disposition of the other issues in this appeal. We,\nhowever, will not avoid deciding the standing issue on the\nground that it is moot, for the necessity for a party to have\nstanding is jurisdictional and thus a court of appeals always\nmust determine if the district court from which the appellant\ntook the appeal had jurisdiction.\n63\n   As we already have indicated, this new theory rests on an\nevaluation prepared by a psychologist that the plaintiffs engaged\nto evaluate the student plaintiffs. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013,\nat 36-38. During oral arguments, one of appellants’ attorneys\nput the number of students who appellants claimed were\nclassified incorrectly at five but the other attorney put the\nnumber at six. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 12, 14, 19, 36.\nOur analysis does not depend on the figure being five or six.\n\n\n                                95\n\fwas identified as disabled but without challenging the accuracy\nof the identification with respect to that contention.\nAccordingly, it is not clear that Amber in this litigation has\njoined in all respects with the other students now identifying\nthemselves as having been incorrectly identified as disabled.\n\n        In its February 15, 2008 Order, the District Court found\nthat the Blunts’ ADA, RA, Title VI, and § 1983 claims were\nbarred on a different basis than their IDEA claims. J.A. vol. 1,\nat 42.21-42.29.64 In reaching its conclusion, the Court applied\nPennsylvania’s two-year statute of limitations for personal\ninjury actions to the Blunts’ ADA, RA, Title VI, and § 1983\nclaims because the applicable federal statutes did not include\ngoverning statutes of limitations with respect to these claims.\nSee Sameric Corp v. City of Phila., 142 F.3d 582, 598-99 (3d\nCir. 1998). The Court concluded that the claims were time-\nbarred because Amber Blunt had graduated from high school on\nJune 9, 2005, and the original complaint in this case was filed in\nthe District Court on July 30, 2007, more than two years after\nAmber suffered her alleged injuries. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.28. The\nBlunts do not challenge this disposition. But the Blunts do\nchallenge the Court’s holding that the IDEA 90-day statute of\nlimitations barred their IDEA claims.\n\n       In reviewing this determination, we note the following\n64\n  In its February 15, 2008 Order, the District Court noted that\nthe Blunts conceded that their IDEA, ADA and RA claims\nagainst PDE were untimely, but contended that their IDEA,\nADA and RA claims against the LMSD and the School Board\nwere timely. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.29.\n\n\n                               96\n\ftimeline: the LMSD denied the Blunts’ request for “transitional\nservices” on April 8, 2005, the Blunts requested a due process\nhearing under the IDEA on April 11, 2005, a two-day hearing\nfollowed, and the Hearing Officer issued his decision on July\n25, 2005. Id. at 42.23. Both the Blunts and the LMSD filed\nexceptions to the Hearing Officer’s decision with an Appeals\nPanel which issued its ruling on August 31, 2005. Id.\nTherefore, for purposes of calculating the time allowed by the\nstatute of limitations for the Blunts to file their action under the\nIDEA, their cause of action accrued on August 31, 2005.\n\n        The Blunts argue that the 90-day statute of limitations for\nan IDEA claimant adversely affected by an administrative\ndecision to bring suit in state or federal court does not apply to\ntheir case, even though this statute of limitations became\neffective on July 1, 2005, and the decision in their\nadministrative case became final on August 31, 2005. They\nargue that we should reach this result because they filed their\nrequest for a due process hearing on April 8, 2005, before the\nchange in the limitations period. Therefore, the Blunts believe\nthat an earlier version of the IDEA under which their IDEA\nclaims would have been timely should apply in their case. In\ntheir view, to apply the 90-day statute of limitations effective on\nJuly 1, 2005, to their case “would be an impermissible\nretroactive application of IDEA amendments.” J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.20. They assert that their case is unique because there has\nbeen no other case applying the statute of limitations in a\nsituation in which the administrative due process hearing request\nwas made before the 2004 IDEA amendments became effective,\nbut the final administrative decision was rendered after the\namendments had become effective. Thus, they contend that the\n\n                                97\n\f90-day statute of limitations should not bar their IDEA claims.\n\n        We, however, agree with the District Court, which “[was]\nnot persuaded” by their contention because “[t]he date that the\nhearing was requested is irrelevant.” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.23.\nRather, we look at the statute of limitations in effect on the date\nof the final administrative decision, August 31, 2005. Indeed, it\nmight be asked why we even would consider applying any other\nlimitations period as the Blunts could not have brought their\nIDEA action before August 31, 2005. Consequently, when the\nBlunts’ federal cause of action arose, the 90-day statute of\nlimitations was in effect, and when they brought their case in the\nDistrict Court on July 30, 3007, it was untimely. Inasmuch as\nthe law setting forth the limitations period changed on\nDecember 3, 2004, and became effective on July 1, 2005, the\nchange as applied to them was hardly abrupt and it left the\nBlunts with nine months, from December 3, 2004, until August\n31, 2005, to become familiar with the revisions, and an\nadditional 90 days after August 31, 2005, in which to file their\naction.\n\n        The LMSD cites Steven I. for the proposition that the\ntwo-year statute of limitations governing due process hearings is\nretroactive to the extent that it applies to proceedings pending\nwhen it became effective. It further contends that the seven\nmonths between the enactment of this new statute of limitations\nand its effective date gave potential claimants sufficient notice\nso that its retroactive application did not violate due process.\nThe Blunts contend, however, that Steven I. is not applicable\nbecause that case dealt with the two-year statute of limitations\nfor bringing an administrative claim under the IDEA, rather than\n\n\n                                98\n\fthe specific statute of limitations at issue, i.e., 90-day statute of\nlimitations for bringing a state or federal suit after receipt of an\nadverse administrative determination. But the Blunts cannot\nconvincingly explain why an analysis regarding the 90-day\nstatute of limitations, embodied in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)\nand applicable to the filing of a judicial challenge in a state or\nfederal court to an administrative decision, should be different\nfrom an analysis of the validity of the changing of the time\nperiod in which to bring an administrative claim under the\nIDEA, embodied in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(C). In considering\nthis matter we point out that the amendment of the IDEA on\nDecember 3, 2004, which took effect on July 1, 2005, dealt with\nboth limitations periods.\n\n        We find that the reasoning we employed in Steven I. is\napplicable here. In that case we relied on the analysis in\nTexaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. at 532, 102 S.Ct. at 793. In\nTexaco v. Short, the Court spoke to the issue of fairness, which\nbalances the need for a grace period when shortening a\nlimitations period, with the need for injured parties to be vigilant\nin protecting their rights:\n\n               The Court has upheld retroactive\n               adjustments to a limitations period only\n               when the legislature has provided a grace\n               period during which the potential plaintiff\n               could reasonably be expected to learn of\n               the change in the law and then initiate his\n               action. In the context of a retrospective\n               statute of limitations, a reasonable grace\n               period provides an adequate guarantee of\n\n\n                                 99\n\f               fairness. Having suffered the triggering\n               event of an injury, a potential plaintiff is\n               likely to possess a heightened alertness to\n               the possibly changing requirements of the\n               law bearing on his claim. Because redress\n               necessarily depends on recourse to the\n               State’s judicial system, the State is free to\n               condition its intervention on rules of\n               procedure, and further, to impose on the\n               potential plaintiff the obligation to monitor\n               changes in those rules. Plaintiffs, and their\n               attorneys, are so aware.\n\nId. at 549, 102 S.Ct at 802.\n\n        We therefore concluded in Steven I. that the plaintiffs in\nthat case had been afforded ample time to make themselves\naware of the new two-year statute of limitations measured from\nthe date of injury for seeking administrative review under the\nIDEA. We similarly conclude that the Blunt plaintiffs had\nample opportunity to familiarize themselves with the 90-day\nstatute of limitations with respect to judicial actions. In fact, we\neven question whether the application of the 90-day statute of\nlimitations in this case should be regarded as retroactive\ninasmuch as the Blunts did not receive an administrative\ndecision until after the new statute of limitations was in effect,\nand their federal court cause of action did not accrue under the\nIDEA until the final administrative decision in their case. We\nreiterate that the Blunts cannot adequately explain why the\nreasoning in Steven I. should not be applied in a consideration\nof the effectiveness of the 90-day statute of limitations that was\n\n\n                                100\n\fenacted at the same time as the two-year statute of limitations\nfor bringing an administrative action addressed in Steven I. The\nfact is that the Blunts simply have not made a convincing\nargument for applying the two statutes of limitations in the same\namendment to the IDEA in completely different ways.\n\n          D. Whether Appellants Established a Prima\n          Facie Case of Racial Discrimination\n\n        We deal now with appellants’ challenge to the summary\njudgment rendered against them on their § 1983 and Title VI\nclaims, which allege that the LMSD intentionally discriminated\nagainst them because of their race.65 Appellants explain that\n“[t]his case ultimately rests upon a simple question: What\nquantum of evidence must a plaintiff produce to support an\ninference of intentional racial discrimination in order to\novercome a summary judgment motion?” Appellants’ No. 11-\n4200 br. at 21. In addressing the discrimination claims, the\nLMSD responds that, contrary to the plaintiffs’ contentions,\nthey “presented no evidence to establish: (1) that the classes\nthey took were ‘lower level’ and/or ‘below grade-level’”; (2)\n\n65\n  The Blunts and the CBP are not involved with the summary\njudgment as the District Court dismissed their claims before it\nconsidered the motion for summary judgment. We also note\nthat the appeal with respect to the summary judgment on the §\n1983 claim does not include the aspect of the plaintiffs’\ncomplaint under § 1983 to the extent the complaint was based\non the IDEA, ADA, or RA because the Court dismissed the\nplaintiffs’ claims, other than those of the Blunts, under those\nlaws for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n\n                              101\n\fLMSD maintained any specific discriminatory custom, practice\nor policy; or (3) “that similarly situated Caucasian students were\ntreated differently. Indeed, the record is replete with evidence\nthat class placement . . . is driven by the decisions of students\nand parents.” LMSD’s br. at 36. Thus, the LMSD argues that\n“[t]here is . . . no dispute that Plaintiffs have no direct evidence\nof discrimination.” Id. at 37.\n\n       Appellants argue that “if there is any evidence in the\nrecord from which a reasonable inference in the [appellants’]\nfavor may be drawn, the moving party simply cannot obtain a\nsummary judgment.” Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 5-6\n(quoting Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074,\n1081 (3d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAppellants then conclude that “[LMSD] (and the District Court)\nwere required to accept [all] the testimony of record and any\nlegitimate inference Appellants draw from it, regardless of\nwhether they agreed with those inferences or not,” and that the\nLMSD therefore should not have been granted summary\njudgment. Id. at 5-6 (appellants’ emphasis removed). As stated\nabove, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment a district\ncourt must view the underlying facts and all reasonable\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\nopposing the motion. Genuine and material factual disputes—\nmeaning those that bear on an essential element of the plaintiff’s\nclaim—where the trier of fact could find in favor of the non-\nmoving party must be considered in the light most favorable to\nthe non-movant.\n\n       LMSD was entitled to summary judgment because there\nis no evidence to suggest either that LMSD itself acted with a\n\n\n                                102\n\fdiscriminatory intent, or that it knew of—but failed to correct—\na third party’s intentional discrimination. See S.H., 729 F.3d at\n264. Although appellants present some evidence that African\nAmerican students were overrepresented in a statistical sense in\nspecial education classes, given the record we see no way to\navoid a finding that each individual student’s educational needs\nwere assessed and satisfied through a thorough and\nindividualized process. There is not sufficient evidence to show\nthat the educators and administrators responsible for placing\nstudents intended to discriminate against them because of their\nrace. Moreover, in order to show that LMSD acted with\ndeliberate indifference, appellants must show that it had\nknowledge of rights violations, but there is no evidence in the\nrecord to suggest that it did or that any third party under its\ncontrol engaged in intentional discrimination. See Davis, 526\nU.S. at 646-47 (finding deliberate indifference may be met\nwhere school knows of intentional harassment but fails to act.)\nAppellants argue that the District Court improperly assessed\nwitnesses’ credibility, and discounted its statistical evidence.\nWe discuss these arguments below, but ultimately agree with the\nDistrict Court that the record is insufficient to establish a\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding LMSD’s intent.\n\n                     1. Rejection of Certain Evidence\n                     by the District Court and Alleged\n                     Impermissible Reliance on Other\n                     Evidence Without a Daubert\n                     Hearing.\n\n      As stated above, we review a district court’s decisions on\nadmissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard\n\n\n                              103\n\fwhere a party made known to the district court the substance of\nthe evidence it desires to introduce. Thus, in considering a\ndistrict court’s application of the Federal Rules of Evidence, we\nwill reverse only where “‘there is a definite and firm conviction\nthat the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the\nconclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.’”\n Oddi, 234 F.3d at 146. Here, we conclude that the District\nCourt did not make a clear error of judgment, or, indeed, any\nerror at all in its consideration of the proffered evidence, and\nthat, at trial, the excluded evidence could not have been made\nadmissible. We therefore will uphold all of its rulings regarding\nthe disputed evidence.66\n\n                          a. The MAP Presentation\n\n       Appellants contend that the District Court improperly\ndiscounted a powerpoint presentation discussing a “Minority\nAchievement Program” (MAP). J.A. vol. 5, at 1836-39. The\npresentation included a bulleted list of characteristics of African\nAmerican students and how to teach them effectively. We\nassume the contention that this presentation, if used by LMSD,\n\n66\n  We have not overlooked such cases as Lexington Insurance\nCo. v. Western Pennsylvania Hospital, 423 F.3d 318, 329 n.6\n(3d Cir. 2005), and Williams v. Borough of West Chester, 891\nF.2d 458, 465 n.12 (3d Cir. 1989), in which we indicated that a\ncourt in assessing opposition to a motion for summary judgment\nmight consider unauthenticated documents or hearsay provided\nthat the evidence could be made admissible at trial. Here,\nhowever, we see no bases on which the deficiencies in the\nevidence could have been cured at the trial.\n\n\n                               104\n\fwould provide evidence of discriminatory intent, or deliberate\nindifference to a third party’s discriminatory intent. Yet we do\nnot see any record evidence from which we could conclude that\nthe LMSD ever used or implemented this presentation. The\npresentation does not contain any indication of who authored it\nor how it is connected to the LMSD.67 Instead, appellants rely\non the testimony of Dr. Barbara Moore-Williams, an education\nconsultant retained by LMSD to help it develop “cultural\nproficiency among staff.” J.A. vol. 4, at 1411. Appellants\nattempt to use her testimony for two purposes: to show that\nLMSD used and implemented the MAP presentation and to\nshow intent.\n\n        In Dr. Moore-Williams’ deposition, appellants’ counsel\nquestioned her about whether she had heard LMSD teachers or\nother personnel refer to specific bullet points from the MAP\npresentation. Id. at 1414. Dr. Moore-Williams responded that\nshe had heard teachers or other personnel refer to some of the\nbullet points. Id. Crucially, however, Dr. Moore-Williams did\nnot testify about the MAP presentation itself—she explains that\nshe had heard LMSD personnel discuss in general the concepts\nraised in the presentation, but that does not establish who\nprepared the presentation, or whether LMSD ever used it or for\nwhat purpose. Indeed, even when Moore-Williams indicated\nthat she had heard of certain bullet points, she noted that they\nwere not related to African American students. See id. at 1414\n\n67\n  The dissent points out that the MAP was produced by LMSD\nduring discovery, but we cannot assume anything from this fact.\n\n\n\n                              105\n\f(explaining, with respect to “active” classes, that she had not\n“heard about it in reference to African-American students”). At\nmost, her testimony is relevant to the extent that she heard from\nLMSD personnel that they used different teaching strategies for\nparticular students. But although purposeful use of such\nstrategies may show racial bias and would be repugnant, it is\nnot, as the dissent suggests, sufficient to show that LMSD\ncreated, used, or implemented the MAP presentation. Finally,\nthe MAP presentation does not show that appellants suffered\nintentional discrimination; it does not discuss placement in\nlower-level classes and, as discussed, there is no evidence that\nthese concepts were applied to LMSD’s individualized special\neducation placement decisions.\n\n                         b. Daniel Reschly’s Report\n\n        Appellants argue that “[t]he District Court erred when it\nfailed to conduct a Daubert hearing but still relied on the\nDistrict’s expert Daniel Reschly’s definitions and principles to\nundercut Appellants’ statistical evidence of discrimination by\nthe District.” Appellants further contend that “the portions of\nReschly’s report relied upon by the District Court form part of\nthe basis for the two paragraphs that are specifically referred to\nin appellants’ form of order,” and thus the District Court erred\nin not holding a Daubert hearing on a motion in limine directed\nat the Reschly report. Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 34-\n38. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579,\n113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993). Appellants contend that “Reschly’s\nopinions should have no place in this appeal, as they should\nhave had no place in the District Court’s decision to grant\nsummary judgment without a Daubert hearing. This provides\n\n\n                               106\n\fyet another basis to reverse and remand the District Court’s\nruling.” Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 38. However,\nappellants do not specify the “definitions” and “principles” that\nthe District Court adopted from Reschly’s report.\n\n       It may be that appellants’ specific objection with regard\nto Reschly’s report lies with one paragraph of the October 20,\n2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order which refers to\nReschly’s report, consisting of phrases commonly used by those\nstudying the implementation of disability education and services\nunder the IDEA. The paragraph reads:\n\n        Disproportionality is defined as ‘significantly greater or\n       lower participation in special education by one or more\n       groups compared to the participation rates for other\n       groups.’      The preferred methods of analyzing\n       disproportionality are risk and relative risk or risk ratio.\n       Risk is calculated by dividing the number of students\n       with disabilities in a particular group by the total number\n       of students in that group.\n\nNo. 2:07-cv-3100 Doc. No. 180 at 13; J.A. vol. 1, at 16.\n\n        We find this use of Reschly’s wording to define\ndisproportionality to be immaterial to the outcome of this\nlitigation. The District Court did not draw inferences in favor of\neither side from this definition, which, we observe, seems very\nstraightforward. Further, the concepts of risk and relative\nrisk/risk ratio are commonly used statistical terms, and the Court\ndescribed these definitions in the October 20, 2011\nMemorandum and Judgment Order to give the reader a basic\nunderstanding of the statistical data that the plaintiffs presented\n\n                               107\n\fwhich the District Court’s opinion goes on to discuss. We find\nno other “adoption” of Reschly’s views or principles,\nnotwithstanding appellants’ objection to the use of his report.\nAs stated above, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to exclude\nReschly’s expert report as moot, as the Court was able to make a\ndetermination regarding whether plaintiffs had presented a\nprima facie case in its summary judgment analysis without the\nuse of the report.\n\n                   2. Whether the District Court Properly\n                   Viewed the Evidence in the Light Most\n                   Favorable to the Plaintiffs as Non-movants\n                   and Whether Plaintiffs Established a Prima\n                   Facie Case of Discrimination.\n\n        Appellants argue that, when the facts are viewed in the\nlight most favorable to them as non-movants in the District\nCourt, they established a prima facie case under Title VI and §\n1983 applying the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, appellants\ncontend that the Court erred in granting summary judgment\nagainst them on their claims predicated on these bases, as it\nrefused “to view evidence in the light most favorable to [them].”\n Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 28. We point out,\nhowever, that a court’s obligation to view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to a non-movant does not require the court\nto take into account evidence that will not be admissible at the\ntrial. Thus, in considering appellants’ argument with respect to\nthe adequacy of the evidence, we take into account our holdings\nwith respect to the evidence in which we uphold the District\nCourt’s disposition of the issues.\n\n        In its October 20, 2011 grant of summary judgment, the\n\n                              108\n\fDistrict Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to “put forth\nany evidence that supports their contention that they were\n‘segregated’ intentionally into inferior education programs in\nviolation of Title VI,” and that “plaintiffs have not raised a\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding their § 1983 cause of\naction” based on the Equal Protection Clause. J.A. vol. 1, at 31-\n35. The Court, in considering the summary judgment motion,\nnoted that the plaintiffs were required to “raise at least some\nreasonable inference that they were placed into classes and\noffered services by the School District due to intentional\ndiscrimination based on their race and not simply due to errors\nin evaluation.” The Court concluded that plaintiffs failed to\noffer evidence sufficient to support an inference that the LMSD\nhad intentionally discriminated against African Americans.\nMoreover, plaintiffs had not put forth more than a scintilla of\nevidence that the LMSD acted with a racially discriminatory\npurpose in identifying them as disabled and placing them in\nspecial education courses regardless of whether this\nidentification was correct. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not\nidentify an official policy or custom that suggested that the\nLMSD was deliberately indifferent to their rights. J.A. vol. 1, at\n32-36.\n\n       We emphasize that, as we explained above, a non-\nmoving party—here, appellants—opposing a motion for\nsummary judgment has the burden to produce evidence\nsupporting its case with respect to material facts of the case on\nwhich it has the burden of proof. Appellants contend that they\nmet this burden because they did offer more than a scintilla of\nevidence in support of their case and that a reasonable fact\nfinder could have found that the evidence of discrimination they\n\n                               109\n\foffered was sufficient to support a finding in their favor. We, of\ncourse, recognize that in some race discrimination situations\nactors do not leave a “smoking gun” evidencing their intent, and\nin such cases plaintiffs can prove their cases only with\ncircumstantial evidence. In this case, however, the piecemeal\nanecdotes to which appellants point were insufficient to survive\nLMSD’s summary judgment motion.\n\n        The appellants attempt to meet this standard by pointing\nto an email by a member of the LMSD School Board, which\nthey believe supported their prima facie case of discrimination\nwhen read in a light most favorable to them and considered as a\npart of the case as a whole. In discussing school redistricting to\nincrease minority representation in certain schools, one member\nof the School Board apparently wrote an email expressing his\nconcern that “moving any of the low income and African\nAmerican students to Harriton [High School] when they can\nwalk to [Lower Merion High School] simply creates an\nadditional stressor that doesn’t need to be there.” Appellants’\nNo. 11-4200 reply br. at 26.\n\n        Appellants believe that “[f]rom that comment, a\nreasonable jury could conclude that [LMSD] fostered an\ninstitutional culture (expressed by at least one Board member)\nthat tolerated racial insensitivity and viewed African Americans\n[sic] students as creating unnecessary ‘stress.’” Appellants’ No.\n11-4200 reply br. at 27. But we do not need to decide how a\nreasonable jury could construe this email because even though it\nwas available when depositions were taken and a witness other\nthan its author referred to it on a deposition, it was not properly\nsubmitted to the District Court as it was not introduced into\n\n\n                               110\n\fevidence and its author was not deposed. Consequently,\nappellants cannot rely on the email to defeat the motion for\nsummary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).68 Thus, the\nemail did not contribute to the admissible evidence appellants\nneeded to have survived summary judgment.\n\n          Appellants also argue that the District Court wrongly\ndiscounted the deposition testimony of Dr. Moore-Williams, an\nindependent consultant that the LMSD had engaged prior to this\nlitigation to address minority issues in the LMSD, as being\nbased on her personal beliefs and on hearsay. In considering\nthis testimony, the Court found that her opinions were not based\non anything that she had observed firsthand, but rather\nconcerned attitudes about race in the country and the education\nsystem in general. Appellants seem to conflate the issue of\nadmissibility of evidence with the requirement of taking\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant when\nconsidering a summary judgment motion. Thus, during oral\nargument, appellants’ counsel argued that the District Court\n\n68\n  As far as we can tell, the original email was submitted in an\nunrelated case against the LMSD, Doe v. Lower Merion School\nDistrict, 689 F. Supp. 2d 742, 755 (E.D. Pa. 2010). We also\npoint out that when the scope of this litigation is considered it is\nnot easy to understand how an email by one school board\nmember expressing concern about putting stress on students by\nrequiring that they be transferred away from a school to which\nthey can walk supports the allegations of the complaint. But we\ndo not predicate our result on this observation.\n\n\n\n\n                                111\n\fshould have found that there was evidence that LMSD\ncommitted an intentional wrong against African American\nstudents in its schools, not only because it did not consider the\nMAP presentation, but because it also wrongly discounted\nMoore-Williams’ testimony as hearsay. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 51-52. While the MAP issue seems to concern\nadmissibility, it is clear from the October 20, 2011\nMemorandum and Judgment Order that the Court did consider\nMoore-Williams’ deposition testimony, and appellants referred\nto this testimony in their oral arguments on October 4, 2011, in\nthe District Court on the summary judgment motion.69 No.\n2:07-cv-3100 Doc. No. 180 at 25.\n\n       The District Court’s October 20, 2011 Memorandum and\nJudgment Order found that references to Moore-Williams’\ntestimony by the plaintiffs during the October 4, 2011 oral\nargument was “selective and misleading,” and that she had\n“admit[ted] that her statements about the School District [we]re\nnot based on anything she observed firsthand but rather on her\nown personal belief and the hearsay statements of others.\nAccordingly, her statements cannot create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact regarding the School District’s intent to\n\n69\n  Although appellants objected to the limited weight the District\nCourt gave Moore-Williams’ testimony both in their briefs and\nat oral argument, and made reference to her deposition in the\nappendix, they do not claim to have made a formal motion in\nlimine regarding Moore-Williams’ testimony seeking to have it\nconsidered, nor have they pointed to an order denying its\nadmission or consideration by the District Court.\n\n\n                              112\n\fdiscriminate.” Id. In this regard, we do not see how the\ndeficiencies in her testimony could have been cured so that the\nevidence could have become admissible at trial. Clearly, we\ncannot say that the District Court erred in its treatment of her\nevidence.70\n\n        Indeed, putting aside inadmissible evidence, the\nallegations in all of the complaints and briefs are inconsistent in\ntheir logic. For example, appellants seem to be complaining\nboth that LMSD’s placement of individual students in special\neducation courses has taken them away from “regular” courses,\nwhile at the same time alleging that they did not receive\nadequate special education and support.71 It is unclear what\nactions LMSD could have taken that plaintiffs would deem\nappropriate. In order to participate in full schedules of both\nspecial education and regular education classes, students would\nneed a longer school day than students taking only regular\neducation classes. Further, if individual students require extra\n\n70\n  We note that inasmuch as the Blunts do not appeal from the\nOctober 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order granting\nsummary judgment, we will not address their allegations.\n\n\n71\n   One example, among many, is found in the following\nparagraph of the TAC: “Denying these Plaintiffs and the class\nthe opportunity to participate in and benefit from federally-\nassisted regular education services, program and activities,\nincluding special education and related services . . .” TAC at\npara. 175(a); J.A. vol. 9, at 3889 (emphases added).\n\n\n                               113\n\fhelp in particular subjects, obviously it is counterintuitive to\nprotest that, for example, they are not receiving foreign language\ninstruction during the time that they are participating in remedial\ncourses.\n\n        We also point out that at various points in the SAC the\nplaintiffs express dissatisfaction with grades that are too low,\nand at other points complain of grades that are too high.\nPlaintiffs seem to believe that the divergence in grades\ndemonstrates that they were placed in courses that either were\ntoo easy or too difficult, depending on which plaintiff they are\ndiscussing.72 But student placement is not an exact science, and\ndifferent children have different needs. We repeatedly have\nexplained that the teachers and parents, school districts, and\nadministrative review boards are closest to the issues at hand,\nand therefore they are the best persons or entities to address\nindividual concerns and complaints. Of course, this recognition\nunderlies the need for the exhaustion requirements of the IDEA.\n\n\n                      3. Statistical Evidence\n\n       In Meditz v. City of Newark, 658 F.3d 364, 371 (3d Cir.\n2011), we cited several Supreme Court cases to support our\nconclusion that gross statistical disparities may serve to establish\na plaintiff’s prima facie case in a Title VII case if the statistical\n\n72\n  By this reasoning the only acceptable grade that would not\ngive rise to a legal claim might be a “C,” and the giving of any\nother grade might be viewed as evidence that a school district\nwas at fault for not providing an appropriate education.\n\n\n                                114\n\fevidence is of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the\npolicy or practice in question caused the discrimination. In\nconsidering the statistical evidence in this case, we note first that\nfor monetary damages to be awarded under Title VI, the\ndiscrimination must be intentional. See, e.g., Lane v. Pena, 518\nU.S. 187, 191, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 2096 (1996) (“[D]amages are\navailable under Title VI for intentional violations thereof.”\n(citing Guardians Ass’n v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of N.Y.C., 463\nU.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221 (1983))). However, even if this were\nnot the case and we simply applied the analysis we articulated in\nthe Meditz Title VII case, the statistics do not indicate gross\ndisparities of the kind and degree sufficient to give rise to an\ninference that the non-uniform individualized analyses of\nstudents in the LMSD, utilized to determine appropriate\nclassroom placement, reflected a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination.\n\n        The District Court in its October 20, 2011 Memorandum\nand Judgment Order discussed in detail the statistical data that\nthe plaintiffs put forward. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 180 at\n13-18. As the Court pointed out, “[d]isproportionality is not per\nse evidence of discrimination” and, as plaintiffs’ own experts\nhave acknowledged, disproportionality can be either biased or\nunbiased. Id. at 14. Noting that “[t]here is no specific\nnumerical criteria for disproportionality set forth in the IDEA or\nfederal regulations,” the Court explained that the PDE has\nestablished guidelines whereby it considers a disproportionality\nof 3.0, i.e., three to one, to be an indication of over-\nrepresentation of that race, while the United States Department\nof Education’s guidelines indicate that a 1.5 disproportionality\nratio is an overrepresentation of that race. Id. at 14-15.\n\n                                115\n\f                       The District Court summarized the data presented by\n               plaintiffs (collected by the PDE) for the LMSD for the years\n               2005-2010 as follows:\n\n       Total student body at LMSD         Students Participating in special education courses\n\n                   %      of\n                   total\n                   number                               % of total\n                   of                     Total         student       %       of   %       of\n                   students               Number of body that         special      special\n                   who         % of total students that participate   education    education\n     Total         were        number of participated d          in   students     students\n     Number        African     students   in special special          who were     who were\n     of            America     who were education       education     African      Caucasia\nYear students      n           Caucasian courses        courses       American     n\n\n’05-   6,945       7.7%        84.4%      1,255          18.1%        12.7%        82.6%\n‘06\n\n’06-   6,981       7.9%        83.2%      1,187          17.0%        14.5%        80.2%\n‘07\n\n’07-   6,914       8.1%        83.1%      1,158          16.7%        14.0%        80.8%\n‘08\n\n’08-   6,788       8.0%        81.6%      1,101          16.2%        13.7%        80.5%\n‘09\n\n’09-   7,072       8.6%        81.1%      1,094          15.5%        14.3%        80.0%\n‘10\n\n\n                                            116\n\fId. at 16-17. Though these numbers undoubtedly show that it\nwas more likely that an African American student than a\nCaucasian student would be placed in a special education\ncourse, the numbers are not so disproportionate that they suggest\nthe presence of discrimination in student placement absent\nadditional evidence that could justify drawing this inference.\n\n        In considering the statistics, it is critical to recognize that\nthere was no evidence presented in the District Court that the\nLMSD applied different evaluation procedures for determining\nplacement of African American students than for Caucasian\nstudents. After all, if the same evaluation procedures are used\nfor all students regardless of their race there simply is no\ndiscrimination. Moreover, the opinion of the plaintiffs’ expert,\na psychologist, that five or six of the students in question\nincorrectly had been identified as learning disabled was not\nrendered until these proceedings were pending in the District\nCourt and was insufficient to support a prima facie case for the\nplaintiffs, particularly inasmuch as she predicated her opinion\non her personal evaluation of the students.\n\n        In fact, we doubt that anyone could explain better than\nLMSD’s counsel did at oral argument why the divergence of\nviews on student placement should not be a basis to support\nplaintiffs’ claims:\n\n       [LMSD] has procedures in place that are followed\n       for all students. And the fact a psychologist could\n       disagree with [LMSD’s] psychologist and say\n       ‘No, I don’t think this person met these criteria’\n\n                                 117\n\f       doesn’t prove or produce any evidence to suggest\n       that that was as a result of these students’ races.\n       The psychologist did not [attempt] . . . to\n       ascertain . . . that identification process . . . to see\n       if there was perhaps some other indicia that could\n       be pointed to as to why that occurred. Instead, it\n       was simply, ‘I don’t believe these students were\n       [properly] identified.’ From that, the plaintiffs\n       had made the leap that therefore it must be\n       because of their race.\n\nTr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 37-38.\n\n        In reaching our result, in addition to considering the\nstatistics we have cited and plaintiffs’ expert’s claim that\nstudents were misidentified, we have considered plaintiffs’\nallegation that a small number of special education classes at\nLMSD were comprised of 100% African American students.\nBut the problem with that evidence is that it was not offered in a\ncontext from which a meaningful correlation between race and\nclass placement could be demonstrated because plaintiffs did not\naccompany it with testing data, grading, and other factors that\nmight provide some meaning to the evidence that they offered.\nUnder the IDEA structure, school districts that accept federal\nfunds such as the LMSD must treat every student as an\nindividual, and thus must evaluate, test, and monitor the student\nindividually, as well as provide an IEP for the student on an\nindividual basis. If by following this mandate a school district\nshould make a special education placement for a particular\nstudent, the school district should not decline to make the\nplacement merely because the application of the mandate leads\n\n\n                                118\n\fto students of a particular group being statistically\noverrepresented in special education grouping. We certainly are\nnot going to require or even suggest that school districts use a\nquota system in assigning students to special education classes\nso that the percentages of students in such classes be\nproportionate to overall school ratios when measured on a racial\nbasis. A school district has the function of educating its\nstudents, and should be concerned with that critical matter rather\nthan with producing particular statistics.\n\n        Appellants’ evidence of discrimination consists of\nstatistical evidence that African American students were\noverrepresented in special education classes, testimony\nindicating that certain LMSD educators had discussed different\nlearning styles and an email from a School Board member\nexpressing concern about putting extra stress on black students.\nHowever, the record also reflects that each individual student’s\neducational needs were assessed and satisfied through a\nthorough and individualized IEP process, and contains no\nevidence that the educators and administrators responsible for\nplacing students intended to discriminate against them because\nof their race. Taking the record as a whole and drawing all\ninferences in appellants’ favor, there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact that LMSD itself—or a third party under its\ncontrol—engaged in intentional discrimination.\n\n\n\n                     VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       First, we hold that the District Court correctly held that\nthe action against the PDE was barred by principles of res\n\n                               119\n\fjudicata (claim preclusion) as a result of the settlement of the\nclass action in Gaskin v. Pennsylvania, 389 F. Supp. 2d 628.\nWe reach that conclusion because the Gaskin class included all\nschool-age students with disabilities in Pennsylvania who were\ndenied a FAPE, and the claims pleaded against the PDE in this\ncase were brought on behalf of students within the Gaskin class.\n Thus, the claims asserted against the PDE in this case overlap\nwith the claims that had been brought against it in Gaskin.\n\n        Next, in reviewing the District Court’s conclusions\nregarding the IDEA’s statute of limitations for a party adversely\naffected by an administrative determination of an IDEA claim to\nbring a state or federal suit, we hold that the Court correctly\nconcluded that the 90-day statute of limitations barred the\nBlunts’ IDEA claims. In reaching this result, we hold that it did\nnot matter that the Blunts’ administrative judicial process began\non April 8, 2005, a date on which the IDEA’s statute of\nlimitations for bringing a claim in state or federal court after\nreceiving an adverse administrative determination was two\nyears, because the Blunts’ final administrative disposition was\non August 31, 2005, almost two months after the 90-day statute\nof limitations came into effect, and almost nine months after\nCongress enacted it. Contrary to the Blunts’ contention, the\namended statute of limitations was not unfairly retroactively\napplied, for they had nine months notice regarding the\namendment of the statute of limitations before their IDEA action\nwas barred; thus they had ample time to bring their case. In\nfact, inasmuch as their cause of action did not arise until after\nthe amendment of the statute of limitations, it is fair to say that\nthe amendment simply was not applied retroactively in their\ncase. Further, as noted above, the Blunts had the responsibility\n\n                               120\n\fto be vigilant about changes in legislation, including statutes of\nlimitation. Our reasoning in Steven I. regarding the shortened\nIDEA statute of limitations for bringing an administrative claim\nplainly applies here with respect to the judicial claim.\n\n       Judge Greenberg concludes that CBP did not have\nstanding to sue on its own behalf or on behalf of its members,\nbut Judges Ambro and McKee conclude that the District Court\nerred in dismissing CBP for lack of standing because CBP had\norganizational standing under Havens. Although a majority of\nthe Court thus does not accept the District Court’s ruling that\nCBP did not have standing, this conclusion does not change our\noutcome in light of a different majority’s independent\nconclusion that the Court properly entered summary judgment\nagainst the plaintiffs, as CBP has not explained why it could\nhave prevailed where the individual plaintiffs did not.\n\n        We also hold that the District Court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in how it dealt with disputed evidence. The Court\nwas correct in determining that the MAP presentation was not\nauthenticated, and it did not abuse its discretion in discounting\nMoore-Williams’ testimony or in not giving it more weight than\nit did. Further, the Court did not err in its use of Reschly’s\nreport.\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs did not establish a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VI or § 1983; thus, the entry\nof summary judgment against them on their claims under those\nlaws was appropriate. Evidence that the District Court found to\nbe inadmissible need not have been considered in a light most\nfavorable to the non-movant plaintiffs because the evidence\ncould not have become admissible at trial. Further, the evidence\n\n                               121\n\fbefore the Court did not support a circumstantial prima facie\ncase of racial discrimination in violation of Title VI or § 1983.\nIn particular, the statistical evidence was insufficient to establish\na prima facie case even when considered with other evidence.\n\n        The IDEA’s goal is to ensure that educators and parents\nhave necessary tools to improve educational results of disabled\nstudents. See 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(3) (stating as one purpose of\nthe IDEA, “to ensure that educators and parents have the\nnecessary tools to improve educational results for children with\ndisabilities by supporting system improvement activities”). As\nwe have noted in the past, it is not necessarily the case that\nwhen students do not achieve equal results from their education\nthere is a constitutional violation. Coalition to Save Our\nChildren v. State Bd. of Educ. of State of Del., 90 F.3d 752, 766\n(3d Cir. 1996); see also Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney,\n442 U.S. 256, 273, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2293 (1979) (It is a “settled\nrule that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal laws, not\nequal results.”).\n\n       In summary, we will affirm the District Court’s orders of\nOctober 20, 2011, February 15, 2008, and August 19, 2009, on\nappeal at Nos. 11-4200 and 11-4201, and will dismiss LMSD’s\ncross-appeal at No. 11-4315.73\n\n73\n  We are affirming the order of August 19, 2009, even though\nonly Judge Greenberg agrees with the District Court that CBP\ndoes not have standing and the District Court dismissed CBP on\nthat ground. Appeals are taken from judgments, not opinions,\nsee Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781 (1984), and Judge\n\n                                122\n\fAmbro joins in the disposition of the case dismissing CBP\nbecause it has not explained how, if it had been permitted to\ncontinue in the case, it could have prevailed, a conclusion with\nwhich Judge Greenberg agrees.\n\n\n\n       We recognize that Chief Judge McKee believes that we\nare not affirming the August 19, 2009 judgment because the\njudgment recites that the motion to dismiss for lack of standing\nis granted and both he and Judge Ambro reject the District\nCourt’s conclusion on the CBP standing issue. But obviously\nthe judgment simply dismisses the claim and the reference to the\nlack of standing is merely an explanation for the operative order\nwhich is to dismiss CBP’s claim. The reference to a lack of\nstanding is no different than a reference to the Court’s opinion\nfinding that CBP did not have standing. Therefore, inasmuch as\nJudge Ambro is voting to affirm the August 19, 2009 judgment,\nthough on a basis other than its lack of standing, the judgment is\nbeing affirmed.\n\n       Judge Ambro’s vote brings into play the “well established\n[principle] that we are free to affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt on any basis which finds support in the record.” Bernitsky\nv. United States, 620 F.2d 948, 950 (3d Cir. 1980). We have\napplied this principle in the context of affirming a district\ncourt’s ruling on a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Tourscher v.\nMcCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999); Central Pa.\nTeamsters Pension Fund v. McCormick Dray Line, Inc., 85 F.3d\n1098, 1107 (3d Cir. 1996) (acknowledging power to “affirm\ndecision of the district court on grounds other than those relied\n\n                               123\n\fupon by the district court” but declining to exercise it). The\nSupreme Court also has noted that “settled” rule “that, if the\ndecision below is correct, it must be affirmed, although the\nlower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong\nreason.” Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154,\n158 (1937).\n\n\n                             124\n\f Amber Blunt, et. al. v. Lower Merion School District, et. al.\n           Nos. 11-4200, 11-4201 & 11-4315\n_________________________________________________\n\nAMBRO, Circuit Judge, concurring\n\n        I agree with and join in Judge Greenberg’s excellent\nand thorough opinion as to all but Part VII.B, which deals\nwith whether Appellant Concerned Black Parents of Mainline\nInc. (“CBP”) has standing to sue. Although standing is a\njurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived, Pub. Interest\nResearch Grp. of N.J., Inc. v. Magensium Elektron, Inc., 123\nF.3d 111, 117 n.5 (3d Cir. 1997), “the presence of one\nplaintiff with standing is sufficient to satisfy that\nrequirement.” Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights v.\nRumsfeld, 390 F.3d 219, 228 n.7 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986)), rev’d on other\ngrounds, 547 U.S. 47 (2006). The standing of the individual\nPlaintiffs here has never been challenged (nor should it).\nThus the individual Plaintiffs confer standing and CBP’s\nstanding as an organization is irrelevant.\n\n       Were it necessary to decide, I would agree with Judge\nMcKee that, under Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\nU.S. 363 (1982), CBP has standing to sue on its own behalf.\nHowever, I also agree with Judge Greenberg that the claims\nof the individual Plaintiffs were properly dismissed at\nsummary judgment. CBP, who shared counsel with some of\nthe individual Plaintiffs, has not explained how, were it\npermitted to continue as a plaintiff in the case, it could prevail\nwhere the individual Plaintiffs have failed. Thus I agree with\nJudge Greenberg’s disposition of these appeals on their\nmerits. For these reasons, I concur.\n\fBlunt v. Lower Merion Nos. 11-4200, 11-4201, 11-4315\n\nMcKee, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart.\n\n       Today we hold that a group of African-American\nparents and students have not produced sufficient evidence to\nhave a jury decide if race is a factor in how African-American\nstudents are assigned to special education classes in their\nschool district. My colleagues reach this result even though\nthe record contains numerous issues of disputed fact that\nwould support plaintiffs’ claims if a jury resolved those\ndisputes in the plaintiffs’ favor.\n\n       The allegations here are not pretty. No one likes to\nthink that a school district, especially one with an outstanding\neducational reputation, allows race to be a factor in assigning\nAfrican-American students to special education classes.\nHowever, there is sufficient evidence on this record to\nestablish that a trial is warranted to determine whether this\nschool district did exactly that. I therefore write separately to\nexpress my strong disagreement with my colleagues’\nconclusion that these plaintiffs cannot survive summary\njudgment.\n\n      Despite that strong disagreement, I do agree that the\nGaskin settlement bars the Title VI and § 1983 claims that\nhave been brought against the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation (“PDE”) as discussed in Section VII.A of the\nMajority Opinion.1\n\n        The District Court’s August 19, 2009 ruling that the\nsettlement agreement bars claims against the PDE sets forth\nthe relevant language of the settlement agreement. That\nagreement identified the plaintiffs as: “representatives of a\ncertified class consisting of all school-age students with\ndisabilities in Pennsylvania who have been denied a free\nappropriate education in regular classrooms with\nindividualized supportive services, individualized instruction,\n\n1\n I also join Part VII.C of the Majority Opinion in which my\ncolleagues discuss the statute of limitations.\n\fand accommodations they need to succeed in the regular\neducation classroom.”      Blunt v. Lower Merion School\nDistrict, 262 F.R.D. 481, 491 (E.D. Pa. 2009). The\nagreement was in effect from September 19, 2005 to\nSeptember 19, 2010. Id. Although, as counsel for CBP noted\nat oral argument, those claims are very different from the\nclaims here, the language of the settlement agreement is very\nbroad in its scope and provides in part as follows:\n\n [i]n consideration of the performance of PDE’s obligations under\n     the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiffs, individually and\n collectively hereby remise, release, and forever discharge each of\nthe defendants […] from all actions and causes of action, suits, . . .\nclaims and demands whatsoever . . . , known or unknown, foreseen\n  or unforeseen, particularly those which were or could have been\nset forth in Gaskin v. Pennsylvania Department of Education, No.\n 94-CV-4048 (E.D. Pa.), or which any of the plaintiffs ever had or\n   now has, . . . or may have, for . . . any reason of any cause, . . .\n  whatsoever arising out of or related to the claims brought by the\n    plaintiffs against the defendants in the Gaskin case from the\n   beginning of the world to the effective date of the Settlement\n                             Agreement[.]\n\nId. (ellipses and bold type and italics emphasis in original,\nunderline emphasis added). The claims in this suit, though\nquite different from the claims in Gaskin, are clearly “related\nto the claims brought by the plaintiffs . . . in the Gaskin case.”\n\n        However, for the reasons that follow, I cannot agree\nthat Concerned Black Parents, Inc. (“CBP”) lacks standing\n(as discussed in Section VII.B of the Majority Opinion) or\nthat the District Court properly granted summary judgment on\nthe claims that these Plaintiffs brought against the Lower\nMerion School District (“LMSD”) under Title VI and 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 (as discussed in Section VII.D of the Majority\nOpinion).\n\n                     I. CBP’S STANDING\n                     A. General Principles\n\n        As Judge Greenberg explains, Article III requires a\nplaintiff to demonstrate a sufficient interest in the outcome of\nlitigation to establish a “case or controversy” and thus have\nstanding to sue on the plaintiff’s own behalf or as a\n\n\n                                   2\n\frepresentative of others.2 As the Supreme Court explained in\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 , 511 (1975), “[t]here is no\nquestion that an association may have standing in its own\nright to seek judicial relief for injury to itself and to vindicate\nwhatever rights and immunities the association itself may\nenjoy. . . . [e]ven in the absence of injury to itself, an\nassociation may have standing solely as a representative of its\nmembers.” 422 U.S. at 511 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       The District Court held that CBP was unable to\ndemonstrate a sufficiently concrete injury to itself or the\nparents it represents to have standing to bring this suit. Blunt,\n262 F.R.D. at 486. In rejecting CBP’s claim of standing, the\nDistrict Court focused on the fact that CBP is not a student\nand therefore could only demonstrate “an abstract, ideological\n\n2\n   Judge Greenberg properly notes that his discussion of\nCBP’s standing is not the holding of this Court, because\nJudge Ambro agrees that CBP has personal standing. See\nMajority Opinion (“Majority Op.”) at 97-98 & n.72.\nHowever, for reasons of convenience and clarity, with the\nexception of Judge Greenberg’s discussion of personal\nstanding, I frequently refer to his opinion in its entirety as the\n“Majority Opinion,” or the opinion of “my colleagues.”\n    Judge Greenberg engages in a very detailed analysis to\nexplain why he believes that CBP lacks standing. He\nexplains that such a detailed analysis is appropriate because\n“[w]e . . . will not avoid deciding the standing issue on the\nground that it is moot, for the necessity for a party to have\nstanding is jurisdictional and thus a court of appeals always\nmust determine if the district court . . . had jurisdiction.”\nMajority Op. at 73 n.62. However, there is no dispute\nwhatsoever about the standing of the individual plaintiffs, nor\ncould there be. Accordingly, the jurisdiction of the District\nCourt and this Court is clear and undisputed. Accordingly,\nJudge Greenberg’s discussion of standing is dicta. See Galli\nv. New Jersey Meadowlands Comm’n, 490 F.3d 265, 274 (3d\nCir. 2007) (“[W]e are not bound by our Court’s prior dicta . .\n. .”).\n    Nevertheless, in order to respond to Judge Greenberg’s\nvery detailed analysis, and to avoid any questions about the\nimpact of our discussion on future suits by organizational\nplaintiffs, I will discuss CBP’s standing in some detail.\n\n                                 3\n\finterest in the litigation as opposed to the necessary ‘personal\nstake in the outcome’ of the controversy necessary to confer\nstanding.” Id. (citing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727,\n735 (1972)).3\n\n        In his separate opinion, Judge Ambro states: “ I would\n agree with Judge McKee that, under Havens Realty Corp. v.\n Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982), CBP has standing to sue on\n  its own behalf.” Ambro at 1. However, both Judge Ambro\nand Judge Greenberg believe that CBP’s standing is irrelevant\n  because they do not believe CBP can prevail on the merits.\n Majority Opinion (“Majority Op.”) at 98-99 n.72; Ambro at\n 1. Of course, CBP’s likelihood of success on the merits has\n no bearing on its standing. The issue of CBP’s standing not\n   only “matter[s], it is of the utmost importance . . .” as our\n       decision here is precedential and can impact other\n    organizations in the future. “In essence, the question of\n  standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court\n    decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.”\n                     Warth, 422 U.S. at 498.\n\n       Moreover, the standing issue is dispositive for\npurposes of the merits of CBP’s appeal of the August 19,\n2009 judgment because we are not affirming that judgment.\nAs the Majority Opinion correctly notes, “[a]ppeals are taken\nfrom judgments, not opinions.” Majority Op. at 98 n.72\n(citing Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)). CBP appealed the District\nCourt’s August 19, 2009 judgment. That judgment states:\n\n3\n  The District Court also held that CBP did not have\nrepresentational standing because its bylaws stated that CBP\nhad no members, and “in light of this express statement in a\nformal document governing . . . the corporation, [the District\nCourt concluded] that [CBP] does not have standing to bring\nsuit on behalf of its members because it has none.” Id. at 487.\nI do not discuss the issue of whether CBP has representational\nstanding because there is no need to. Judge Ambro and I\nagree that CBP has standing to sue based on its own injuries.\nI do note that the District Court failed to appreciate the extent\nor nature of CBP’s own injuries or the nature of CBP’s efforts\nto advance the interests of parents of African-American\nchildren in the LMSD.\n\n                                4\n\f“the motion of defendants, the Lower Merion School District\nand the Lower Merion School Board, to dismiss the claims of\nConcerned Black Parents of Mainline, Inc. and the Mainline\nBranch of the NAACP for lack of standing is GRANTED.”\nJoint Appendix (“J.A.”) at 42.69 (emphasis added). It is\ntherefore beyond dispute that CBP was dismissed from the\ncase because of standing, and only because of standing.\nBecause a majority of this Court now holds that CBP does\nhave standing, see, e.g., Majority Op. at 97, the District\nCourt’s August 19, 2009 judgment must be reversed as to the\ndismissal of CBP.\n\n        Thus, it is simply inaccurate to claim that our holding\nregarding standing “does not change [the] outcome in light of\na different majority’s conclusion that [the District Court]\nproperly entered summary judgment against the plaintiffs.”\nMajority Op. at 97. The appeal from the District Court’s\njudgment granting summary judgment against the individual\nplaintiffs must be decided separately because it arises from a\ndiscrete judgment. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 467 U.S. at 842.\nFurthermore, any suggestion that CBP must explain “why it\ncould have prevailed where the individual plaintiffs did not,”\nsee Majority Op. at 97, has no basis in the law. Because CBP\nwas dismissed from the litigation on a motion to dismiss, it\nwas unable to engage in the same discovery as other parties;\nno summary judgment motion was filed against it and it\ntherefore did not have a full opportunity to fairly oppose\nsummary judgment.\n\n        When the District Court dismissed CBP for lack of\nstanding, it did so without any motion to dismiss or motion\nfor summary judgment being filed against CBP. The\nMajority is correct that the District Court considered CBP’s\nstanding twice—once before the Third Amended Complaint\nand once after it—and discovery was taken after the first\ndismissal, Majority Op. at 59 n.52. However, that does not\nresolve the procedural issue here. Plaintiffs filed for class\ncertification. In opposing that certification, defendants\nargued that CBP could not serve as a class representative, but\nthe defendants did not move to dismiss CBP from the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\fJ.A. at 918-19. Rather, the District Court sua sponte\ndismissed CBP for lack of standing. J.A. at 42.69.4\n\n       While the Majority is correct in noting that a judgment\nmay be affirmed for any reason that is supported by the\nrecord, this record is more than adequate to survive summary\njudgment based on the standing of CBP as well as the\nindividual plaintiffs. Judge Ambro and I agree that CBP has\ndemonstrated that it is entitled to personal standing under\nHavens Realty Corp. Ambro at 1. However, unlike Judges\nAmbro and Greenberg, I also believe there is sufficient\nevidence to survive dismissal on the merits of the relevant\ndiscrimination claims. As I discuss in detail below, the\nDistrict Court failed to properly credit some evidence, and\n\n4\n  Although the District Court notes that defendants “move to\ndismiss the claims of Concerned Black Parents . . . for lack of\nstanding,” J.A. at 924-25, defendants’ motion makes no such\nclaim. Instead, as part of its argument that plaintiffs’\nproposed class representatives cannot adequately represent\nthe class, defendants’ motion states: “Plaintiffs’ evidence\ndoes nothing to establish CBP’s standing and completely fails\nto address the fact that CBP is not a member of the proposed\nclass and therefore cannot be a class representative.” J.A. at\n919.\n\n    Plaintiffs were neither required, nor expected, to present\nevidence to establish CBP’s standing in order to move for\nclass certification. It is therefore not the least bit surprising\nthat they did not then attempt to come forward with evidence\nto establish standing. It appears that the District Court\nfocused on the defendants’ comment about standing and\ntransformed it into a motion attacking standing. J.A. at 928.\nThe District Court then focused on CBP’s lack of formal\nmembership, and concluded that CBP “does not have\nstanding to bring suit on behalf of its members,” ostensibly\naddressing plaintiffs’ claims that CBP may represent the\nclass. J.A. at 932. The District Court then concluded:\n“[a]ccordingly, we will enter an order dismissing Concerned\nBlack parents from this lawsuit for lack of standing.” Id. The\nDistrict Court does not state that it is granting summary\njudgment against CBP for lack of standing. Rather, it simply\nstated that it was “dismissing” CBP. Id.\n\n                                6\n\fimproperly discredited or ignored other evidence. When the\nevidence here is properly viewed in its entirety, the record\nestablishes genuine issues of material fact pertaining to Plaintiffs’\nclaims under Title VI and § 1983, and the resulting harm. See\ninfra Section III at 30-60. CBP has also presented sufficient\nevidence to raise a genuine dispute of material fact regarding harm\nit suffered as a result of the LMSD’s conduct. See infra Section\nI.B at 7-19.\n\n       For these reasons, the August 19, 2009 order, must be\nreversed as to CBP’s dismissal for lack of standing; a\nmajority of this Court now holds that CBP does have\nstanding.\n\nB. CBP’s Personal Standing\n\n        An organization has standing to assert its own injuries\n(“personal standing”) when it can show: (1) a concrete and\nparticularized injury-in-fact, (2) a causal connection between\nthe injury and the conduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood\nof redressability. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); see also Fair Housing Council of\nSuburban Philadelphia v. Montgomery Newspapers, 141 F.3d\n71, 76 (3d Cir. 1998) (“In order to defeat the summary\njudgment motion based on the issue of standing, [the\nopposing party] was required to submit ‘affidavits or other\nevidence showing through specific facts…that…it [was]\n‘directly’ affected [by the alleged discrimination]. . . .’”)\n(emphasis in original).\n\n        To show an injury in fact, CBP must show that its\nactivities or operations were sufficiently disrupted by the\ndisputed conduct. In Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455\nU.S. 363, 378-79 (1982), the Supreme Court held that the\ndistrict court had erred in dismissing the claims of a nonprofit\norganization based on its alleged lack of standing. The\nnonprofit organization there (“HOME”) was committed “to\nmak[ing] equal opportunity in housing a reality in the\nRichmond Metropolitan Area.” Id. at 368 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). In furtherance of its mission,\nHOME counseled potential renters and undertook\ninvestigations to determine if landlords were discriminating\nagainst potential tenants by “steering” them to particular\n\n\n                                  7\n\frental units or neighborhoods based on race. Id. at 368-69.\nHOME sent “testers” of different races into the community\nwhere they inquired about advertised rental units to determine\nif certain landlords were engaged in racially discriminatory\nsteering. Id. at 368. As part of its investigation, HOME sent\ntwo testers to inquire about rental properties owned by\nHavens Realty Corporation (“Havens”). Id. The African-\nAmerican tester was incorrectly told that certain apartments\nwere not available. Id. Simultaneously, the Caucasian tester\nwas told that the very same apartments were available. Id.\n\n       HOME sued Havens for housing discrimination,\nalleging that it had standing to sue in its own right and on\nbehalf of its constituents. Id. HOME claimed it had itself\nbeen injured because Havens’ conduct “frustrated the\norganization’s counseling and referral services, with a\nconsequent drain on resources.” Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court agreed. The Court reasoned that\nwhere an organization’s ability to provide its primary services\nhas been “perceptibly impaired,” the organization has\npersonal standing to attempt recover for its injuries. Id. at\n379. HOME asserted that it had “been frustrated by\ndefendants’ racial steering practices in its efforts to assist\nequal access to housing through counseling and other referral\nservices.” Id. That was sufficient to allege an Article III\ninjury.     The Court explained: “[s]uch concrete and\ndemonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the\nconsequent drain on the organization’s resources—constitutes\nfar more than simply a setback in the organization’s abstract\nsocial interests.” Id. Specifically, HOME’s complaint\nincluded an allegation that it “[had] to devote significant\nresources to identify and counteract the defendant’s [sic]\nracially discriminatory steering practices.” Id. (brackets in\noriginal). The additional expense and the need to counteract\nHavens’ allegedly discriminatory conduct was a sufficiently\nparticularized and concrete injury to confer standing upon\nHOME. Id.\n\n       We elaborated on Havens Realty in Montgomery\nNewspapers. There, the defendants raised the same issues\nraised in Havens Realty, but on a motion for summary\njudgment. 141 F.3d at 73. The plaintiff there was a nonprofit\n\n                               8\n\forganization that worked “to educate and promote fair\nhousing and to oppose segregation based on the protected\nclasses found in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended.”\nId. In an effort to advance that objective, the organization\nsued multiple defendants, including a newspaper that had run\nadvertisements that appeared to perpetuate housing\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender and familial status. 5 Id.\nThe plaintiff’s response to the defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment relied heavily on Havens Realty. The\nplaintiff argued that it had sufficiently alleged its own injuries\nbecause the defendant newspaper’s “acceptance and\npublication of discriminatory housing advertisements\nfrustrated the organization’s mission and [damaged] the\norganization . . . by . . . divert[ing] resources to fight the\ndiscrimination.” Id.\n\n        We granted summary judgment to the defendants, but\nonly because the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence to\nsupport its alleged injuries. “[S]omething more than . . .\nnaked allegations were required at the summary judgment\nstage.” Id. at 76. We explained that the nonprofit “was\nrequired to submit affidavits or other evidence showing\nthrough specific facts … that … it [was] directly affected by\nthe alleged discrimination.” Id. (italics, brackets, and ellipses\nin original, bold emphasis added, internal quotation marks\nomitted). The organization had not produced any evidence\nthat it had “altered its operations in any way as a result of the\nallegedly discriminatory advertisements or diverted any of its\nresources to a bona fide investigation.” Id. at 78. “[B]are\nallegations of injury such as those based on the investigation\ndescribed [there were] not enough to establish standing.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we held that\nthe organization had not established an Article III injury.\n\n\n\n\n  5\n    “The complaint included copies of six advertisements which\n  appeared in Montgomery newspapers between November, 1993\n and March, 1994. Each of these advertisements contained one of\n  the following allegedly objectionable phrases: ‘mature person’,\n ‘ideal for quiet and reserved single and-or couple’; ‘professional\n      male … only’ and ‘quiet mature setting.’” Montgomery\n                    Newspapers, 141 F.3d at 73.\n\n                                 9\n\f       Thus, Montgomery Newspapers involved a failure of\nproof. It does not support the conclusion that CBP has failed\nto introduce sufficient evidence of its own injury to survive\nsummary judgment here.\n\n       As discussed in detail below, CBP produced sufficient\nevidence of its own concrete and particularized injuries to\ncreate an Article III case or controversy. While it is\nobviously true (as the majority and the District Court note)\nthat CBP is not itself a student within the LMSD, that\ncircumstance is only minimally relevant at best.\n\n       In Powell v. Ridge, 189 F.3d 387, 391, 404 (3d Cir.\n1999), a case also brought under Title VI and § 1983, we\nstated that organizational plaintiffs that “devote substantial\nresources to overcoming what they allege are the disparate\nand inadequate educational programs caused by” the state’s\nfailure to equally contribute funding and resources to\nminority school districts, had standing to sue on their own\nbehalf.6 We explained that “the standing of the plaintiff\norganizations to bring this suit is consistent with the long line\nof cases in which organizations have sued to enforce civil\nrights . . . .” Id. at 404 (citing Walters v National Ass’n of\nRadiation Survivors,442 U.S. 347, 352 & n. 8 (1979); Havens\nRealty, 455 U.S. at 369 (1985); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442\nU.S. 347, 352, 353 & n.8 (1979); Fair Employment Council\nof Greater Washington, Inc., v. BMC Marketing Corp., 28\nF.3d 1268, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994); N.A.A.C.P v. The Medical\nCenter, Inc., 657 F.2d 1322 (3d Cir. 1981)). Some of the\nrelevant organizational defendants in Powell such as “Parents\nUnion for Public Schools” and “Parents United for Better\nSchools” had an organizational purpose quite similar to\nCBP’s, and the actions they took to advance that purpose\nwere also quite similar to actions CBP undertook here. Id. at\n387, 391.\n\n       Any focus on the fact that CBP is an organization of\nparents (rather than students) is particularly hard to\nunderstand in the context of the allegations of racial bias that\nunderlie this lawsuit. The interests of children in the quality\n\n6\n Disapproved of on other grounds in Fowler v UPMC\nShadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 404 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n                                10\n\fof their education is identical to the interests their parents\nhave in seeing them obtain such an education without the\npoisonous sting of racial bias. The harm African-American\nstudents allegedly suffered here cannot readily be amputated\nfrom a concomitant harm to their parents or to an\norganization that devoted scarce resources to remedying it.\nAfter all, the nonprofit organization in Havens Realty had not\nbeen denied housing. Yet, the Supreme Court ruled that the\nnonprofit had standing to challenge discriminatory housing\npractices because it had been forced to devote its own\nresources to its efforts to remedy racial discrimination in the\nhousing market. See Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379.\n\n       Here, CBPs purpose includes efforts to “promote\nequity and excellence” in education for diverse students. It\nadvances that purpose by addressing “issues related to\neducation for populations identified as minority and/or\nAfrican-American.” Blunt and CBP Appellants’ Br. at 11.\nThere is no suggestion that this statement of purpose is\ninaccurate. Given that purpose, the record establishes that\nCBP has an interest in the outcome of the litigation, and that\nthe alleged discriminatory conduct of LMSD negatively\naffects the organization’s central activities, requiring it to\nincur extra expenses and provide resources to mitigate\nLMSD’s conduct. Blunt, 262 F.R.D. at 486; see also J.A. at\n3169.\n\n       Judge Greenberg lists several of the injuries that CBP\nalleges, but ignores the evidence produced to support those\ninjuries. See Majority Op. at. 62-63. The following\nnumbered headings recite some of the injuries Judge\nGreenberg lists, and the discussion that follows each heading\nexplains where supporting evidence can be found in this\nrecord:7\n              [1] Use of its resources to ‘host educational\n              consultants and experts’ with the purpose of\n              providing information to the Plaintiffs, class\n              members, community and LMSD;\n\n\n7\n Majority Op. at 62-63(citing TAC at 25-26; J.A. vol. 9, at\n3871-72) (footnote omitted) (I have added bracketed numbers\nand bold emphasis for ease of reference).\n\n                               11\n\f       CBP hosted numerous educational events featuring\neducational consultants and experts. These experts were paid\nto speak to parents about the effects of the LMSD’s conduct\nand how to counteract the consequences of that conduct.\nCBP’s president, Loraine Carter, testified that, “[s]ince 2006,\n[CBP has] coordinated public forums for parents in the\ncommunity” by bringing in experts “to address the\nunderachievement of African-Americans in the School\nDistrict.” J.A. at 3167. Moreover, CBP’s newsletter\nreferences numerous speaking events held each month with\nprominent scholars and educational leaders. Id. at 1495. For\nexample, in January 2004, CBP met with Dr. Donald Clark\nregarding educational law, history, and policy as it pertains to\nboth African-American students and Pennsylvania. Id. In\nFebruary 2004, it arranged for Dr. Freya Rivers, an\neducational consultant, to speak at a CBP meeting regarding\nstrategies she uses to identify high achieving children and\n“closing the achievement gap.” Id. CBP also listed the\nfollowing activities, among others, in its Fall of 2004\nschedule: “Special Education Action Roundtable; Youth\nTown Hall Meetings; Education Empowerment Sessions;\nAdvocacy Training Sessions.” Id.\n\n              [2] A ‘sharp’ rise in expenditures over the\n              last five years due to its efforts to ‘protect its\n              members from the adverse impact’ of ‘the\n              inferior quality of LMSD’s dual system of\n              education’;\n\n       There is evidence that CBP incurred expenses\nresponding to the allegedly discriminatory conditions at\nLMSD and the resulting need to advocate on behalf of parents\nseeking to change the educational circumstances of their\nchildren. Id. at 3169. From December 2005 to March 2006,\nCBP had an income of approximately $1,090 and expenses of\n$1,106. Id. Like HOME in Havens Realty, CBP had to divert\nits scarce resources to counseling and otherwise supporting\nAfrican-American families who were allegedly being\ndiscriminated against by LMSD, in order to minimize the\nimpact of LMSD’s purportedly discriminatory attitudes and\nactions toward African-American students. Evidence that\nCBP’s expenses exceeded its income constitutes far more\nthan the bare allegations of the complaint in Montgomery\n\n                                12\n\fNewspapers; this evidence demonstrates that CBP suffered a\ndiscrete and cognizable injury as a result of LMSD’s conduct.\n\n              [3] Expenditure of resources as a result of its\n              attending meetings related to IEPs, Section\n              504 and ‘disciplinary meetings, court\n              hearings and parent-teacher conferences\n              with and/or on behalf of’ various plaintiffs,\n              CBP members and class members;\n\n        Like HOME’s board members in Havens Realty,\nCBP’s board members had to attend LMSD’s educational and\ndisciplinary meetings, as well as court hearings, on behalf of\nAfrican-American students. Barbara Metzger, who worked as\na special education teacher at LMSD during the relevant time\nperiod, testified in her deposition that on at least one occasion\nshe “was invited to and sat in on a portion of a Concerned\nBlack Parents’ conversation with some of the school\nadministrators” regarding concerns that “African-American\nstudents, as a whole, . . . were not performing at the same\nrate, not experiencing the same success as other students.” Id.\nat 1456. She also noted that, among other issues, CBP raised\nconcerns that “these students didn’t feel welcome in the\nschool.” Id. CBP engaged in dialogue with LMSD as part of\ntheir advocacy and counseling services for parents whose\nchildren were experiencing discrimination, in an effort to\nraise the concerns at issue in this case.\n\n              [4] Publication of a community newsletter\n              and ‘News Notes . . . to disseminate the\n              compilations of data on’ alleged racial\n              disparities in application of disciplinary\n              measures, segregation by race and ‘under\n              achievement of African-American students\n              in the [Lower Merion] District’;\n\n       CBP published and distributed numerous newsletters\naddressing claims of bias in order to inform parents of\nLMSD’s conduct. For example, in Volume 1, Issue 3 of its\n“Main Line Voice” newsletter, CBP sought “a district-wide\nstrategic plan to close the achievement gap,” citing statistics\nindicating that the same academic excellence that\n“characterizes the LMSD eludes more than sixty percent\n\n\n                                13\n\f(60%) of its African-American students.” Id. at 1494. This\nnewsletter also includes data demonstrating that African-\nAmericans are statistically more likely than their Caucasian\npeers to have IEPs and significantly less likely to be classified\nas gifted. In fact, as I will discuss, for the years that were\nstudied, the probability that an African-American student\nwould be classified as “gifted” or assigned to an Advance\nPlacement class was zero, as none were. Id.8\n\n              [5] The ‘organization’ of educational, career,\n              standardized test, financial aid, and college\n              preparatory seminars.\n\n        Finally, there is ample evidence that CBP advocated\nfor, and provided, college preparation resources that it\nbelieved African-American students needed because of\nLMSD’s purported failure to properly address their needs. In\nher deposition, Ms. Metzger mentioned a meeting she\nattended with school administrators where she raised\nnumerous claims of discrimination on behalf of African-\nAmerican students. CBP “believed that at times, guidance\ncounselors or others, personnel, maybe didn’t afford [African-\nAmerican students] the same consideration when it came to\nthe college planning process.”      Id. at 1456. Ms. Carter\nsimilarly testified that CBP has “met with a number of . . .\ncommunity organizations and institutions that we’ve\nidentified to bring them together” with LMSD, to provide\nsupport to African-American students. Id. at 3406. Thus,\nCBP has demonstrated that it has provided career and college\ncounseling services to the school’s African-American\nstudents to make up for services that it claims LMSD unfairly\nwithheld from these students.\n\n       Judge Greenberg’s analysis suggests that these actions\ndo not establish Article III injuries because “CBP’s very\npurpose relates to actions directly involving LMSD, and its\nexpenditures were devoted to protecting students’ interests in\ntheir interactions with LMSD.” Majority Op. at 64. He\nbelieves this is different from HOME’s injuries in Havens\n\n8\n I will discuss such evidence in detail below in order to\nexplain how the District Court erred in concluding that there\nwas no genuine dispute of material fact. See infra 50-81.\n\n                                14\n\fRealty because “HOME’s purpose was to promote equality in\nthe Richmond area overall and its interests thus went far\nbeyond monitoring the specific actions at issue in the Havens\ncase.” Id. To the extent that I understand that argument, it\nappears to be the classic distinction without a difference.\nCBP would not have had to undertake any of the actions or\nexpenses detailed on this record absent the alleged racial bias\nof LMSD toward African-American students. The fact that\nCBP’s actions are focused on remedying the results of bias\nwithin a school district rather than promoting equality\nthroughout the township of Lower Merion (or Montgomery\nCounty) is absolutely irrelevant. See Majority Op. at 64.\nWhether an organization monitors discrimination in a city or\nsimply a school district does not affect whether it has\nstanding to protect its own interests.9 See Majority Op. at 64-\n65.10\n       Moreover, nothing in this record supports Judge\nGreenberg’s suggestion that CBP’s expenditures relate solely\nto this litigation or that it is thereby trying to manufacture\nstanding through litigation. See Majority Op. at 64\n(“organizations may not satisfy the injury in fact requirement\nby making expenditures solely for the purpose of litigation.”)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n9\n  As noted above, in Powell v. Ridge, this Court held that an\norganizational plaintiff similar to CBP contesting\ndiscrimination in a local school district had personal standing\nto assert its claims. Powell, 189 F.3d at 391, 404. Thus, it is\nincorrect to argue that an organizational plaintiff representing\nthe interests of students in the school district is unable to\nmake a personal standing claim under Havens. Id. (citing to\nHavens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 369); Majority Op. at 64-\n65.\n10\n   Therefore, Judge Greenberg’s observation that “[i]t\nappears that the alleged additional expenditures were\nconsistent with CBP’s typical activities and it is thus unclear\nthe effect, if any, that this litigation had on their\nexpenditures,” Majority Op. at 64, misses the point. CBP’s\nactivities were all focused upon combating the effects of the\nracial bias alleged in LMSD toward African-American\nstudents. The fact that it had to make additional expenditures\nto combat any particular action or to mitigate the impact of\nthe alleged bias is irrelevant to its standing.\n\n                                15\n\f       Judge Greenberg states: “CBP has failed to show why\nthis particular litigation has frustrated its mission, or caused a\n‘concrete and demonstrable’ injury to its activities.” Maj. Op.\nat 64.11 However, that is not the issue. The issue is not\nwhether the litigation has drained CBP’s resources, but\nwhether CBP has had to devote its scarce resources to\ncombating the perceived bias of LMSD and the inferior\neducational opportunities that CBP believes African-\nAmerican students in that school district are afforded.\n\n        Moreover, this record establishes a diminution of\nCBP’s resources irrespective of any subsequent litigation. It\nis abundantly clear that the organization’s goal was not\nsimply to advance litigation against LMSD, but to counteract\nand monitor LMSD’s day-to-day conduct. See, e.g., J.A. at\n3169 (Carter testifying that in 2005-2006, CBP’s expenses\nexceeded its income). The impact on CBP’s scarce resources\nresulted from the organization’s response to the bias it\nbelieved African-American children in LMSD were subjected\nto, not from the litigation that was brought to address it.\nJudge Greenberg’s approach would result in a classic Catch-\n22: nonprofit organizations that had devoted resources and\nincurred expenses to combat a particular activity would\nsomehow lose their standing to sue if they decided that it was\nnecessary to resort to litigation.          Judge Greenberg’s\nobservation that “CBP has failed to show why this particular\nlitigation has frustrated its mission, or caused a ‘concrete and\ndemonstrable’ injury to its activities,” Majority Op. at 64,\ntherefore misses the point of the standing inquiry. The issue\nis not whether this litigation has drained CBP’s resources, but\nwhether CBP’s efforts to combat perceived bias within the\nLMSD has drained CBP’s scarce resources. I do not doubt\nthat the litigation has negatively impacted this nonprofit, but\nthat is neither the beginning nor the end of our inquiry, nor\nshould we focus on that one factor.\n\n        Moreover, even assuming that some of CBP’s\nactivities and expenses were incurred as a result of litigation,\nsummary judgment review requires drawing all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the nonmovant and not against it. Josey\n\n11\n   In addition, far from frustrating CBP’s mission, this\nlitigation is absolutely consistent with that mission.\n\n                                 16\n\fv. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., 996 F.2d 632, 642 (3d Cir.\n1993) (“in the context of an appeal from summary judgment\n[we] must evaluate evidence in the light most favorable to\n[the nonmovant] and draw all inferences in his favor.”).\n\n       CBP operates on the proverbial “shoe string” budget,\nand clearly had to divert its already-scarce resources to\nmitigating the impact of the conduct alleged here. See\nHavens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379 (“[i]f, as broadly alleged,\npetitioners’ steering practices have perceptibly impaired\nHOME’s ability to provide counseling referral services for\nlow - and moderate - income homeseekers, there can be no\nquestion that the organization has suffered injury in fact.”).\nThe evidence supporting CBP’s assertions that it was injured\nby LMSD’s discriminatory conduct distinguishes this case\nfrom Montgomery Newspapers, and suffices to meet the\nstandard for personal standing at the summary judgment\nstage. See Havens Realty, 455 U.S.at 379.12\n\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT APPLIED THE WRONG\n    TEST TO APPELLANTS’ CLAIMS UNDER TITLE\n    VI AND 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n        The District Court applied the wrong test in granting\nLMSD’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims\nunder Title VI and § 1983. As the Majority correctly notes,\nthe appropriate standard for determining liability under Title\nVI is deliberate indifference. I note the following to amplify\nthe Majority’s discussion of the appropriate standard for\nliability under Title VI and § 1983.\n\n12\n   Judge Greenberg cites La Asociacion de Trabajadores de\nLake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.2d 1083, 1088 (9th\nCir. 2010) (an out of circuit case that is obviously not\nbinding) for the proposition that an organization “must . . .\nshow that it would have suffered some other injury if it had\nnot diverted resources to counteracting the problem” in order\nto demonstrate standing. Majority Op. at 64. However, we\nhave never imposed any such impediment to Article III\nstanding. This additional hurdle is simply contrary to the\nminimal injury required under Article III. See, e.g., Havens\nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. at 377.\n\n                               17\n\f        As the District Court notes, to establish a prima facie\ncase under Title VI, plaintiffs must show that they: (1) were\nmembers of a protected class, (2) were qualified for the\neducational benefit or program at issue, (3) and that they\nsuffered an adverse action, (4) which occurred under\ncircumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\nBlunt, 826 F.Supp.2d 749, 758 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\n       In order to establish a prima facie claim under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs needed to show that their right to be\nfree from racial discrimination, as guaranteed by the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, was\nviolated, and that the violation was committed by a person\nacting under the color of state law. See Chainey v. Street, 523\nF.3d 200, 219 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n        The District Court concluded that both the § 1983\nclaim and the Title VI claims failed because Plaintiffs were\nunable to show a discriminatory purpose.           The court\ndetermined that Plaintiffs failed to “put forth ‘more than a\nscintilla’ of evidence that the School District acted with a\nracially discriminatory purpose when identifying them as\ndisabled and offering them special education services, even if\nthis identification was somehow incorrect.” Blunt, 826 F.\nSupp. at 764 (quoting Williams v. Borough of West Chester,\n891 F.2d 458, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989)).\n\n        According to the District Court, “there was no direct or\ncircumstantial evidence of intentional racial discrimination by\nthe School District,” and this was fatal to Plaintiffs’ claims.\nId at 762. However, the test for “intentional discrimination”\nthat the District Court applied to reach that conclusion is\ninconsistent with decisions of the Supreme Court, our sister\nCircuit Courts of Appeals, and our own precedential opinions.\nIt is also inconsistent with the vast majority of courts that\nhave interpreted the meaning of “discrimination” under\nstatutes that are inextricably linked to, derived from, and\napplicable to provisions of Title VI. This is no minor concern\nbecause we cannot determine if there is sufficient evidence of\nPlaintiffs’ claims to withstand summary judgment unless the\ncorrect test for evaluating this record is first identified and\napplied.\n\n                                18\n\f        In Pryor v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletics Ass’n, 288 F.3d\n548 (3d Cir. 2002), we emphasized that proof of disparate\nimpact was not, by itself, sufficient to establish the requisite\nintent to discriminate under Title VI. Id. at 562 (“[a] mere\nawareness of the consequences of an otherwise neutral policy\nwill not suffice” to establish intentional discrimination)\n(internal citations omitted). Rather, we held that, “[in order\nto] prove intentional discrimination by a facially neutral\npolicy, a plaintiff must show that the relevant decisionmaker\n(e.g., a state legislature) adopted the policy at issue ‘because\nof,’ not merely ‘in spite of’ its adverse effects upon an\nidentifiable group.” Id. (quoting Personnel Administrator of\nMassachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Our holding rested in large part\nupon Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001).\n\n        However, as we explained recently in S.H. vs. Lower\nMerion School District, 729 F.3d 248, 264 n.24 (3d Cir.\n2013), “Pryor [reached its result] because it equated\ndeliberate indifference with disparate impact.” Id. at 264 n.24\n(citing Pryor, 288 F.3d at 568). S.H. relied upon the Supreme\nCourt’s post-Sandoval jurisprudence as exemplified by\nJackson v Birmingham Bd. Of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 173\n(2005).     There, the Supreme Court “[recognized] that\ndeliberate indifference is a form of intentional\ndiscrimination.” S.H., 729 F.3d at 264 n.24.13 (Emphasis\nadded).\n\n       Given our unequivocal pronouncement in S.H. that\ndeliberate indifference “is a form of intentional\ndiscrimination, and not a pseudonym for disparate impact,” it\nis clear that the Plaintiffs here do not have to prove\ndiscriminatory animus, as the District Court held and as my\ncolleagues’ analysis implies. Id. (emphasis in original). Of\ncourse, I appreciate the fact that the District Court did not\nhave the benefit of our decision in S.H. when it granted\nsummary in favor of the defendants. However, my colleagues\nand I do.\n\n13\n  Jackson cited Gebser, and both involved claims filed under\nTitle IX. However, as I have already mentioned, and as I\nexplain in greater detail below, that is a distinction without a\ndifference.\n\n                                19\n\f      Although it is true that the claims in S.H. arose under\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the\nRehabilitation Act (RA), not Title VI or § 1983, this is\nimmaterial as the statutes are interrelated.\n\nA. The Proper Test for Discriminatory Intent\n\n1. Civil Rights Statutes and the “Deliberate Indifference”\nStandard\n\n       In order to avoid any confusion over the applicability\nof the deliberate indifference standard, its application under\nTitle VI here, or the relevance of cases decided under certain\nother statutes, it is helpful to expound on the majority’s\nexplanation of the relationship of Title VI to other civil rights\nstatutes related to it, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Title IX of\nthe Educational Amendments of 1978 (“Title IX”). See\nBarnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002). Courts often\nlook to the standard that applies under one of these statutes, to\ndecide cases brought under one of the others. Id. The\nSupreme Court, this Court, and nearly all of our sister Courts\nof Appeals that have addressed the standard for establishing\nintentional discrimination under these interrelated civil rights\nstatutes (the RA, ADA, and Title IX) have held that deliberate\nindifference can be sufficient to establish the required\ndiscriminatory intent. Evidence of discriminatory animus is\nnot required.\n\n   a. The Interrelationship of Title VI, The RA, and the\n      ADA.\n\n       As my colleagues note, the RA prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in federally funded\nprograms, including employment programs receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (1998). The\nADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in\nemployment, public accommodations, public entities and\ntransportation, and telecommunications. 42 U.S.C. § 12101\net seq. (2009). As noted above, the RA and ADA are\ncoextensive with Title VI. Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185 (2002);\nS.H. ex. rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School Dist., 729 F.3d\n248, 261 (3d Cir. 2013). In Barnes, the Supreme Court\n\n\n                                20\n\fexplained: “the remedies for violations of . . . the ADA and . .\n. the [RA] are coextensive with the remedies available in a\nprivate cause of action brought under Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination in\nfederally funded programs and activities.” 536 U.S. at 185\n(internal citation omitted). In S.H., we explained that:\n       Section 203 of the ADA states that the remedies\n       available under § 202 of the ADA are the same\n       remedies available under § 505 of the RA.\n       Similarly, § 505 of the RA clearly states that the\n       remedies available under § 504 of the RA shall\n       be the same remedies available under Title VI\n       of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n  S.H., 729 F.3d at 260-61.\n\n        Under both the RA and the ADA, “deliberate\nindifference is a form of intentional discrimination . . . .”\nS.H., 729 F.3d at 264 n.24 (emphasis in original) (internal\ncitation omitted). Because the RA itself states that Title VI’s\nrights and remedies should apply, the same deliberate\nindifference standard that applies under the RA should apply\nto claims brought under Title VI.\n\n       “Supreme Court precedent construing Title VI governs\nenforcement of the RA and the ADA as well,” because both\nlaws were modeled on Title VI. S.H., 729 F.3d at 261\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n        When we decided S.H., this was an issue of first\nimpression for us. Id. at 260 (“We have not yet spoken on\nthis issue.”). We therefore took pains to explain our inquiry\ninto “[w]hich standard to apply – discriminatory animus or\ndeliberate indifference. . .”, and we provided a thorough\nexplanation of our decision to adopt the majority rule. We\nexplained that our discussion was (at least in part) in response\nto the Eleventh Circuit’s observation that “despite the\nadoption of the deliberate indifference standard by many of\nour sister courts, ‘there has been little explication for the\nconclusion that intentional discrimination under the RA may\nbe established by deliberate indifference.’” Id. at 263 (quoting\nLiese v. Indian River County Hosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 345\n(11th Cir. 2012)).\n\n                                21\n\fb. Title VI and Title IX.\n\n       Fewer than ten years after Title VI was passed,\nCongress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n1972 (“Title IX”) to protect against gender-based\ndiscrimination in federally funded educational programs. 20\nU.S.C. § 1681 (2014) (“No person in the United States shall,\non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.”). Congress explicitly modeled Title IX on Title\nVI. “Except for the substitution of the word ‘sex’ in Title IX\nto replace the words ‘race, color, or national origin’ in Title\nVI, the two statutes use identical language to describe the\nbenefited class.” Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677,\n694-95 (1979).\n\n       Given the interrelated nature of the statutes, “[t]he\ndrafters of Title IX explicitly assumed that it would be\ninterpreted and applied as Title VI had been during the\npreceding eight years.” Id. at 696; see also Barnes v.\nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002) (“The Court has\ninterpreted Title IX consistently with Title VI . . .”);\nFitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 254-58\n(2009) (“Congress modeled Title IX after Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and passed Title IX with the explicit\nunderstanding that it would be interpreted as Title VI was.”)\n(internal citations omitted). The standard for intentional\ndiscrimination under Title IX is clearly deliberate\nindifference. Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education,\n526 U.S. 629, 642 (1999); Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent\nSchool District, 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998).\n\n       In Davis, a parent brought suit against the Monroe\nCounty Board of Education because her fifth-grade daughter\nhad been repeatedly sexually harassed by another student in\nher class. Davis, 526 U.S. at 632-33. The harassed student\n(LaShonda) and her family reported the harassing student’s\nconduct to various school officials, including her teachers and\nthe principal. Id. at 634. The harassing student was\neventually charged with, and pled guilty to, sexual battery for\nharassing LaShonda and others. Id. In the suit that followed,\nthe plaintiffs alleged that, despite the fact that the student pled\n\n                                 22\n\fguilty, the school took no disciplinary action in response to\nLaShonda’s repeated complaints, and it failed to make any\neffort to protect LaShonda by separating her from the\nharassing student. Id. at 635. The defendants argued that\nplaintiffs needed to demonstrate that the defendants\nthemselves had actually harassed LaShonda, not simply that\nthey had ignored her harassment at the hands of another\nstudent. Id. at 636. The Supreme Court relied on Gebser,\nand held that the school board could itself be liable for sexual\nharassment under Title IX if it was deliberately indifferent to\nthe peer-on-peer sexual harassment. Id. at 641-43 (“Gebser\nthus established that a recipient intentionally violates Title IX,\nand is subject to a private damages action, where the recipient\nis deliberately indifferent to known acts of teacher-student\ndiscrimination.”) (internal citations omitted)(emphasis\nadded).\n\n        The rational for allowing deliberate indifference to\nestablish intentional discrimination under Title VI is further\nillustrated by limitations and obligations arising from the\nSending Clause authority that each of the analogous statutes\nis based upon.\n\nc. The Relevance of the Spending Clause\n\n       Title VI, Title IX, the RA and the ADA are all based\non the same exercise of congressional power under the\nSpending Clause. U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1. Guardians\nAss’n, 463 U.S. at 598-99 (1983) (opinion of White, J.)(Title\nVI); Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287 (Title IX); S.H., 729 F.3d at 264\n(RA and ADA).\n\n       In Gebser, the Supreme Court explained how the\nsource of congressional authority in enacting Title IX and\nTitle VI informed interpretation of the statutes:\n\n       Title IX's contractual nature has implications for our\n       construction of the scope of available remedies. When\n       Congress attaches conditions to the award of federal\n       funds under its spending power, U.S. Const., Art. I, §\n       8, cl. 1, as it has in Title IX and Title VI, we examine\n       closely the propriety of private actions holding the\n       recipient liable in monetary damages for\n\n                                 23\n\f       noncompliance with the condition. Our central concern\n       in that regard is with ensuring that “the receiving entity\n       of federal funds [has] notice that it will be liable for a\n       monetary award.”\n\nGebser, 524 U.S. at 287-88 (emphasis added) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\nIn S.H. we explained:\n\n       [t]he RA and ADA were enacted under\n       Congress’s Spending Clause power; legislation\n       that is enacted under this power ‘is much in the\n       nature of a contract’ between the federal\n       government and recipients of federal funds” and\n       “[t]he Supreme Court has thus reasoned that a\n       recipient of federal funding, such as the School\n       District here, may be held liable for money\n       damages only when it is on notice by statute\n       that it has violated the law.”).\n\n729 F.3d at 264 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Under the Spending Clause analysis of S.H., animus is\nnot a condition precedent to a contractual breach. Rather,\nintent to breach can be assumed from knowledge of a set of\ncircumstances, and a refusal to remedy them. This is true\nwhether the law in question prohibits gender-based\ndiscrimination under Title IX, disability-based discrimination\nunder the ADA or RA, or racial discrimination as is alleged\nhere under Title VI.\n\n2. The District Court’s Approach is Inconsistent with the\nDecision of Every Other Circuit Court That Has Decided\nThis Issue\n\n       Every Circuit Court of Appeals that has addressed this\nissue has held that the heightened discriminatory animus\nstandard does not apply to Title VI claims. 14 See Bryant v.\n\n14\n   In S.H., we identified two Courts of Appeals that appeared\nto adopt a minority position. The First Circuit in Nieves-\nMarquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 126-27 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n                                24\n\fIndependent School District No. 1-38 of Garvin County,\nOklahoma, 334 F.3d 928, 933-34 (10th Cir. 2003); Zeno v.\nPine Plains Central School District, 702 F.3d 655, 665 n.10\n(2d Cir. 2012) (“Although the harassment in Davis, and the\n‘deliberate indifference’ standard outlined by the Supreme\nCourt, arose under Title IX, we have endorsed the Davis\nframework in cases of third-party harassment outside the\nscope of Title IX.”) (internal citations omitted); Monteiro v.\nTempe Union High School Dist., 158 F.3d 1022, 1034-35 (9th\nCir. 1998) (internal citations omitted); Liese v. Indian River\nCounty Hospital District, 701 F.3d 334, 347-49 (11th Cir.\n2012) (applying deliberate indifference to a disability\ndiscrimination case because the RA is based on Title VI,\nwhere deliberate indifference would be sufficient to show\ndiscriminatory intent).\n\n        In Bryant, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nrelied on Davis in adjudicating a Title VI hostile environment\nclaim. Bryant, 334 F.3d at 934. Plaintiffs there were students\nwho alleged that they were subject to a racially hostile school\nenvironment. Id. at 931. The relevant school officials were\n“aware of the racial slurs, graffiti inscribed in school\nfurniture, and notes placed in students’ lockers and\nnotebooks” and yet, “[t]he principal affirmatively chose to\ntake no action.” Id. at 932-33.         While noting that the\noffending conduct must be intentional to pass muster under\nTitle VI, the Tenth Circuit explained: “[c]hoice implicates\nintent” lest “school administrators . . . sit idly, or\nintentionally, by while horrible acts of discrimination\noccurred on their grounds by and to students in their charge.”\nId. at 933. The court added: “when administrators who have\na duty to provide a nondiscriminatory educational\n\nand the Fifth Circuit in Delano-Pyle v. Victoria Cnty., 302\nF.3d 567, 575 (5th Cir. 2002). However, neither decision\nactually adopts a “minority rule.” Nieves-Marquez never\nrejected the “deliberate indifference” standard as a form of\nintentional discrimination. Similarly, in Delano-Pyle, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not affirmatively\nrequire discriminatory animus to establish intentional\ndiscrimination under the RA and ADA. Instead, the court\naffirmed the jury’s verdict based on intentional\ndiscrimination.\n\n                               25\n\fenvironment for their charges are made aware of egregious\nforms of intentional discrimination and make the intentional\nchoice to sit by and do nothing, they can be held liable” under\nTitle VI. Id.\n\n       The court instructed the district court on remand:\n       to apply the test from Davis v. Monroe County\n       Board of Education” to a Title VI hostile\n       school environment claim because “Congress\n       based Title IX on Title VI; therefore, the\n       Court’s analysis of what constitutes intentional\n       sexual discrimination under Title IX directly\n       informs our analysis of what constitutes\n       intentional racial discrimination under Title VI\n       (and vice versa).\n\n Id. at 934. We should remand and do the same here.\n\n       The Plaintiffs here may not be able to ultimately\nconvince a fact finder that they should prevail under Title VI\nor § 1983, but they have clearly produced sufficient evidence\nto survive summary judgment, and they are clearly entitled to\nhave the correct legal standard of deliberate indifference\napplied to their proof.\n\nIII. THIS RECORD AND SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       My colleagues readily concede the difficulty of\nproving a discriminatory motive and the concomitant\nnecessity of allowing plaintiffs to rely solely on\ncircumstantial evidence. See Majority Op. at 45 (“individuals\nwho violate the law based on discriminatory motives\nsometimes do not leave a trail of direct evidence, but instead\n‘cover their tracks’ by providing alternate explanations for\ntheir actions.”). We have discussed this in some detail in the\ncontext of claims of job discrimination. In Aman v. Cort\nFurniture, 85 F.3d 1074, 1082 (3d Cir. 1996), we stated:\n“defendants of even minimal sophistication will neither admit\ndiscriminatory animus nor leave a paper trail demonstrating\nit.” This is especially true since those who harbor conscious\n(as opposed to subliminal) bias may attempt to “cover their\ntracks[.]” Majority Op. at 45.\n\n\n\n                               26\n\f       Thus, bias will sometimes manifest itself only in subtle\nways that the actor him/herself may not even be cognizant of.\nIn Cort Furniture, we explained that “Discrimination\ncontinues to pollute the social and economic mainstream of\nAmerican life, and is often simply masked in more subtle\nforms.” 95 F.3d at 1082. In Coombs v 616 F.3d, 264, in\ndiscussing the possible unconscious bias of a prosecutor in\nstriking Black jurors we explained, “[l]ike anyone else, trial\nattorneys possess those human frailties that make each of us\nfar too susceptible to social conditioning and the subliminal\nbias that may result.” Surely, teachers in our public schools,\neven though they may not be acting out of racial animus or\nconscious bias, are no less human, and no more immune to\nthe “frailties that make each of us far too susceptible to social\nconditioning and the subliminal bias that may result,” than\nattorneys are.\n\n        This does not eliminate the Plaintiffs’ need to produce\nenough evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment.\nHowever, the nature of the fact to be proven must inform a\ncourt’s analysis of the evidence that is produced. If Plaintiffs\nhave produced enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to Defendants’ deliberate indifference,\nPlaintiffs are entitled to their day in court on their Title VI\nand § 1983 claims whether the deliberate indifference is\nborne of deliberate animus or the more insidious poison of\nsocial conditioning. 15 Here, plaintiffs’ proof is more than\nsufficient to establish a genuine dispute of material fact,\nespecially if we consider the ephemeral nature of the racially\ncaused deliberate indifference they must prove.\n\nA. The Summary Judgment Standard Has Been Ignored\n\n\n\n15\n  For an interesting discussion of the neurological science\nunderlying the subtleties of bias that we discussed in Cort\nFurniture and Coombs, see John A. Bargh, “Our Unconscious\nMind: How Unconscious Thought and Perception Affect Our\nEvery Waking Moment,” Scientific American, Dec. 17, 2013,\navailable at http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-\nunconscious-thought-and-perception-affect-our-every-\nwaking-moment/\n\n                                27\n\f        I reiterate that a court may not “weigh the disputed\nevidence and decide which is more probative,” when deciding\na motion for summary judgment. Lawrence v. National\nWestminster Bank New Jersey, 98 F.3d 61, 67 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(internal citations omitted) (holding that the district court\nerred in ruling that a plaintiff had failed to offer any evidence\nto survive summary judgment on its discrimination claim\nwhere the district court had simply discounted plaintiff’s\nadmissible evidence as less probative than defendant’s.).\nSimilarly, courts may not “make credibility determinations or\nengage in any weighing of the evidence; instead, the non-\nmoving party’s evidence ‘is to be believed[,] and all\njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.’” Marino v.\nIndus. Crafting Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004)\n(quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255\n(1986)).\n\n       The District Court did acknowledge the Plaintiffs’\n“[e]vidence of procedural irregularities” in the way some of\nthe children were erroneously placed into special education\nclasses. Blunt, 826 F.Supp.2d at 760. Yet, the court\ndismissively refused to admit it based upon the court’s belief\nthat “there must be some evidence that irregularities were\nrelated to plaintiffs’ race.” Id. Thus, the Plaintiffs were\ndenied the benefit of all reasonable inferences in defending\nagainst summary judgment and they were also expected to\nprove a negative by dispelling all causes for the “procedural\nirregularities” other than race.\n\n        After demanding that Plaintiffs prove the irregularities\nhere were tied to race - irregularities that my colleagues\nignore, the District Court not only failed to afford the\nPlaintiffs the inference demanded by summary judgment, the\ncourt ignored evidence that was relevant to the very racial\nnexus the court demanded proof of.\n\n       As I will explain below, the Plaintiffs’ expert\nexamined the extent to which African-American students are\noverrepresented in LMSD’s special education classes while\nbeing completely absent from any “high expectation” college\nprep or advanced placement classes, and concluded both as a\nmatter of statistical science as well as common sense that\nthose numbers indicate “there is something systematic about\n\n                                28\n\fthe LMSD practices related to Ethnicity.” J.A. at 1676\n(emphasis added). There is other evidence, that I will discuss,\nthat is easily sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material\nfact if the record is properly viewed in its totality.\n\n        Any appropriately flexible inquiry, if guided by the\ncorrect legal test of deliberate indifference, would have\nrealized the potential for a fact finder to conclude that\nPlaintiffs have met their burden based on all of the\ncircumstantial evidence here. I reiterate: at this point, the\nburden is merely to produce sufficient evidence that there is a\ngenuine dispute of material fact. Plaintiffs do not have to\nprove their case to survive summary judgment, and they are\nentitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\n\n       Circumstantial evidence (which all involved concede\nis not only permissible but necessary in such cases) is\nnothing more than a fact derived from an inference drawn\nfrom proof of underlying circumstances. See Black’s Law\nDictionary 18c (9th ed. 2009). That is exactly what we have\nhere. Although I do not suggest that this record would\nnecessarily result in a reasonable fact finder inferring a racial\nmotive based on deliberate indifference, such a finding would\nclearly be supported by this record, even absent the\nevidentiary equivalent of a “smoking gun.”\n\n       I am thus at a complete loss to understand how the\nDistrict Court could have looked at this record and concluded\nthat Plaintiffs had “not put forth more than a scintilla of\nevidence that the LMSD had acted with a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose [i.e. deliberate indifference] in\nidentifying them as disabled and placing them in special\neducation courses . . . .” See Majority Op. at 86.\n\n        Although we are assured that plaintiffs in cases such\nas this need not produce the proverbial “smoking gun,” it\ncertainly appears that after today, they will be required to\nproduce something akin to evidence of either a muzzle flash\nor a surveillance video in order to survive summary\njudgment.\n\n       In affirming this grant of summary judgment, my\ncolleagues note that there “was no evidence presented in the\n\n                                29\n\fDistrict Court that the LMSD applied different evaluation\nprocedures for determining placement of African-American\nstudents than for Caucasian students.” Majority Op. at 93.\nThere does not have to be.16\n\n        There is an expert’s conclusion that there is\nstatistically significant evidence of African American being\ndisproportionately assigned to special education classes while\nnone are enrolled in advanced placement or “high expectation\nclasses.” We know that the African-American students who\nare plaintiffs here were placed in special education classes\neven though their tests did not indicate such a placement was\nwarranted and/or that deficiencies were relied on for such\nplacements that did not justify a special education\nplacement.17 This is evidence that was dismissed, even\nthough we should be mindful of the difficulties of proof in\nsuch cases and that bias is no longer “worn on sleeves” or\n“carried on signs.”\n\n        Moreover, as I have already explained, no evidence of\ndifferent testing or separate evaluation procedures is required.\nAlthough such evidence would certainly have advanced the\nPlaintiffs’ claim of racial bias, its absence is far from fatal to\nthose claims given the other evidence on this record.\n\n16\n   A relevant article from the highly respected periodical\nmentioned above (n.15) contains a helpful illustration of why\nmy colleagues’ approach to claims of bias is both misguided\nand naivè: “A college admissions officer might zero in on a\nless than stellar grade in an otherwise solid medical school\napplication from a prospective minority student without\nrealizing those same negative features are not weighted so\nheavily for the other applicants.” Bargh supra note 16 at 34.\nAs I discuss below, it appears here that African-American\nstudents may well have been placed in special education\nclasses based on evaluations that did not warrant such a\nplacement. It is therefore irrelevant that the same evaluations\nwere used to place White students in special education\nclasses.\n17\n   And this does not even include evidence that should have\nbeen admitted but was erroneously labeled “hearsay,” or\ncould not survive an overly rigorous authentication\nrequirement.\n\n                                 30\n\fWhether or not the procedural irregularities in the erroneous\nand improper placement of these African-American students\nin special education classes was the result of bias (i.e.\ndeliberate indifference), ineptitude, or coincidence should not\nbe decided on summary judgment given the Plaintiffs’\nevidence.\n\n        My colleagues acknowledge that “plaintiffs’ expert, a\npsychologist [concluded] that five or six of the students in\nquestion incorrectly had been identified as learning disabled. .\n.” Majority Op. at 93. Yet they attach no evidentiary\nsignificance to the fact that nearly every individual African-\nAmerican student in this suit was improperly placed in special\neducation classes, because that expert opinion “was not\nrendered until these proceedings were pending in the District\nCourt . . . .” Majority Op. at 93. I do not understand how that\nbears on whether the Plaintiffs submitted sufficient evidence\nto survive summary judgment in the District Court, and the\nabsence of legal citation or explanation of why this is the least\nbit relevant does not encourage comfort in such a strange\nprinciple. Indeed, I have no idea why one would go to the\ntrouble and expense of obtaining an expert opinion about\nalleged improprieties before the evidence was required as\nproof in a judicial proceeding. The expert opinion was before\nthe District Court when it ruled on the Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. 18\n\n       Although the abuse of discretion standard that governs\nour review of the District Court’s evidentiary rulings is quite\ndeferential, it is not insurmountable and focusing on the\ndeference properly afforded an evidentiary ruling ought not to\nsubstitute for an objective analysis of whether the ruling was\nan abuse of discretion.\n\n     Thus, even if it was proper to ignore the MAP\nPowerPoint and all of Dr. Moore-Williams’ testimony (and it\nwas not), which I discuss in detail below, the remaining\n\n18\n  The District Court never even mentioned the fact that the\nrecord contained evidence that the level of disproportionality\nwas statistically significant, and that it showed “there is\nsomething systematic about the LMSD practices related to\nEthnicity.” J.A. at 1676.\n\n                                31\n\frecord should still have precluded summary judgment. “The\ntotality of the evidence . . . must guide our analysis rather\nthan the strength of each individual argument.” Bray v.\nMarriott Hotels, 110 F.3d 986, 991 (3d Cir. 1997). Yet my\ncolleagues attempt to “explain[] each of the discrepancies in\n[the] record in isolation and conclude[] that none of them\ncreates a material issue of fact.” Id. (internal citation omitted).\n“[S]uch an analysis is improper in a discrimination case.” Id;\nsee also Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, 895 F.2d 1469,\n1484 (3d Cir. 1990) (“A play cannot be understood on the\nbasis of some of its scenes but only on its entire performance,\nand similarly, a discrimination analysis must concentrate not\non the individual incidents, but on the overall scenario.”).\n\nB. Plaintiffs’ Statistical Evidence was Not Properly\nCredited.\n\n      Plaintiffs’ proof consists in part of strong statistical\nevidence. It is summarized in the following chart that is\nbased on data collected by the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation:\n          Total student body at LMSD        Students Participating in special education courses\n                                         Total          % of total%            of\n                    % of total           Number of student bodyspecial\n                    number of% of totalstudents that that             education % of special\n                    students   number of participated participated students       education\n          Total     who werestudents     in     special in    special who were students\n          Number of African-   who were education       education     African-    who were\nYear      students American Caucasian courses           courses       American Caucasian\n’05-‘06   6,945     7.7%        84.4%       1,255         18.1%        12.7%        82.6%\n’06-‘07   6,981     7.9%        83.2%       1,187         17.0%        14.5%        80.2%\n’07-‘08   6,914     8.1%        83.1%       1,158         16.7%        14.0%        80.8%\n’08-‘09   6,788     8.0%        81.6%       1,101         16.2%        13.7%        80.5%\n’09-‘10   7,072     8.6%        81.1%       1,094         15.5%        14.3%        80.0%\n\nMajority Op. at 92-93.\n\n       My colleagues ignore the force of these numbers by\nstating that “[d]isporportionality is not per se evidence of\ndiscrimination, […] [because disproportionality] can be either\nbiased or unbiased.” Majority Op. at 92 (internal quotation\n\n\n                                 32\n\fmarks and citations omitted). Although that is true, recitation\nof that general principle does not justify adopting a wholly\ndismissive attitude toward the evidence of disproportionally\nin the LMSD, or considering it in isolation from other\nevidence.\n\n       For the five-year span captured by these numbers, the\npercentage of Caucasian students in special education classes\nin LMSD was roughly equivalent to, though always less than,\nthe total percentage of Caucasian students in the LMSD\nstudent body. For most of that time frame, the percentage of\nAfrican-American students enrolled in special education\nclasses in LMSD was twice the percentage of the number of\nAfrican-Americans in the student body. These percentages\ndo not exist in a vacuum.\n\n1. Plaintiffs’ Expert Dr. Conroy Placed the Statistical\nEvidence in Context\n\n        Plaintiffs produced the testimony of an expert witness,\nDr. James W. Conroy, Ph.D, who studied enrollment and\nstudent placement in the various courses at LMSD.19 He\nfound that, while African-American students were greatly\noverrepresented in “low expectation” classes, they were\ndramatically underrepresented in more demanding college\npreparatory and advanced placement courses. J.A. at 1671-\n74. “The pattern is that these courses with the highest\nproportions of Black students tend strongly to be courses that\nI would label as ‘low expectations’ courses.” Id., at 1673-74\n(italics added).\n\n      Conroy also examined the racial composition of the\ntwelve advanced or “high expectation” classes. He found that\n\n19\n   Although it is not necessary to note Conroy’s\nqualifications at this stage, it is important to consider that it\nincludes “39 years of research in disability, education, and\nhealth issues among children and adults,” and since\ngraduating Cum Laude, from Yale and earning his Ph.D. in\nMedical Sociology from Temple University, “With\nDistinction,” he has qualified as an expert in disability\nresearch, disability policy, special education and statistical\nanalysis. J.A. at 1670.\n\n                                  33\n\fin 2008, not only were African-American students\nunderrepresented in those classes; the percentage of African-\nAmerican students in “high expectation” classes was “zero.”\nId. at 1674-75 (emphasis in original). In other words, not a\nsingle African-American student was assigned to any of the\ntwelve high expectation classes in LMSD in 2008.20 Id. Lest\none think 2008 was a fluke or a statistical aberration, Conroy\nfound exactly the same pattern “for each of the years 2005,\n2006, 2007, and 2008.” Id. at 1675. For each of those years\nnot a single African-American student was assigned to a\ncollege prep or “high expectation” class in this school district.\n\n        Conroy testified that the extent of this disparity was\n“‘significant’ in the statistical sense.” Id. at 1676. In fact,\nConroy concluded that the disproportionally in LMSD was so\nevident that one need not be an expert in statistics to grasp its\nsignificance. Rather, he believed that “[t]he Lower Merion\npopulation data may be judged practically significant by\nsimple observation of large differences in the kinds of courses\nstudents [sic] Black and Others students wind up in.” Id. at\n1677 (emphasis in original). His conclusion, rejected by the\nDistrict Court as a matter of law, was that: “there is\nsomething systematic about the LMSD practices related to\nEthnicity.” Id. at 1676 (emphasis in original).\n\n        The Majority states that “[t]he District Court . . .\ndiscussed in detail the statistical data that the plaintiffs put\nforward.” Majority Op. at 92. Yet, both my colleagues and\nthe District Court ignore that absolutely no African-American\nstudents were placed in “high expectation” classes during the\nperiod examined by Conroy, and the Majority fails to note\nthat the District Court ignored the expert conclusion that\nLMSD employed these “practices related to Ethnicity.”\nHowever, even if the statistics could properly be viewed in\nisolation, the issue remains not whether those disparities\nestablish deliberate indifference, but whether they create an\nissue of fact about African-American students’ placement in\n\n20\n  Those classes included: Latin 3H, AP Calculus BC, IB\nSenior Project, IB Theory of Knowledge, Economics H, IB\nHistory of Americas HL 2, IB English A1 HL (Part 2), Art 2\nH, AP Spanish Language, AP Physics C Electromagnetism,\nand Organic Chemistry H. J.A. at 1674.\n\n                                34\n\f“low expectation classes” during this time frame, which was a\nperiod when LMSD did not place a single African-American\nstudent into any “high expectation” college prep or Advanced\nPlacement test.\n\n      The Majority attempts to further minimize the\nevidentiary value of this testimony by noting that:\n\n        [t]he Supreme Court also has rejected the use\n       of particular standard deviations or ‘any\n       alternative    mathematical     standard’   in\n       establishing a prima facie case of employment\n       discrimination, and has stressed that the\n       significance or substantiality of numerical\n       disparities must be judged on a case-by-case\n       basis . . . [and they] must be sufficiently\n       substantial that they raise an inference of\n       causation.\n\nMajority Op. at 47 (quoting Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &\nTrust, 487 U.S. 977, 996 (1988).\n\n       There are other problems with the Majority’s attempt\nto ignore the force of the statistical evidence. First, in\nWatson, the Court was deciding whether a statistically based\ndisparate impact analysis was applicable to a claim of\ndisparate treatment in a “subjective or discretionary\npromotion system.” 487 U.S. at 999. The Court said nothing\nthat would assist us in determining the propriety of a sample\nsize or the probative force of the “deviation” here. Indeed,\nthe Court’s only mention of “deviation” was the following\nreference in a footnote:\n\n        Courts have also referred to the ‘standard deviation’\nanalysis sometimes used in jury selection cases. We have\nemphasized the useful role that statistical methods can have in\nTitle VII cases, but we have not suggested that any particular\nnumber of ‘standard deviations’ can determine whether a\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case in the complex area\nof employment discrimination.\n\nId. at 995 n.3 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                 35\n\f        The Majority seems concerned with the sample size\nhere as well as the significance of the deviation. They cite to\nWatson, stating: “the Supreme Court has explained that\nneither the ‘courts nor defendants [are] obliged to assume that\nplaintiffs’ statistical evidence is reliable,’ and has cited, for\nexample, the weaknesses inherent in small or incomplete data\nsets and/or inadequate statistical techniques.” Majority Op. at\n46 (internal citation omitted). That is clearly true as a general\nproposition, but I do not understand how that general\nproposition advances our inquiry. There is nothing on this\nrecord to suggest that the Plaintiffs’ experts’ statistical\nanalysis is flawed, that the data set is “incomplete and/or\ninadequate,” or that their experts’ statistical techniques are\nflawed. The District Court made no such finding and it\nappears that LMSD did not make any such argument to the\ndistrict court.\n\n       The issue in Watson was whether a disparate impact\nanalysis could be used to establish disparate treatment in an\nemployment discrimination suit involving a discretionary\npromotion system at a bank having 80 employees – far fewer\nthan the numbers involved here.           There, the African-\nAmerican plaintiff had attempted to use statistical evidence of\nthe paucity of African-Americans who had been promoted at\nthe bank, in order to establish her disparate treatment claim\nthat the bank had failed to promote her because of her race.\nThe Supreme Court held that statistical evidence of disparate\nimpact could be used to establish a prima facie case of\ndisparate treatment but rejected the position of some courts\nthat looked to EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employment\nSelection Procedures.        Those courts had “adopted an\nenforcement rule under which adverse impact” would “not\nordinarily be inferred unless the members of a particular . . .\ngroup [were] selected at a rate that [was] less than four-fifths\nof the rate at which the group with the highest rate [was]\nselected.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 n.3. The Court restated\nthe “useful role that statistical methods can have in Title VII\ncases,” but cautioned that it had “not suggested that any\nparticular number of ‘standard deviations’ can determine\nwhether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case . . ..” Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                36\n\f        The situation here is remarkably different. In order to\nestablish deliberate indifference under the theory advanced\nhere, Plaintiffs had to first establish that African-American\nstudents were being placed in “low expectation” classes at a\nsignificantly disproportionate rate to Caucasian students.\nEven my colleagues seem to concede that the record\nestablishes that, and LMSD does not really deny that. Any\ndispute about statistical sampling, standard deviations, and “z\nscores,” is beside the point.\n\n2. There are Issues Regarding Defendants’ Expert’s\nMethodology\n\n        Plaintiffs’ expert explained his methodology in great\ndetail and we have only my colleagues’ countervailing\nimplied mastery of statistics to dismiss the statistical validity\nof Plaintiffs’ expert’s conclusions. My colleagues’ concern\nabout such statistical terms of art as: “data sets” and\n“statistical techniques” and sample size, is even more\npuzzling when one considers that the Defendants’ expert, Dr.\nDaniel Reschly, reached a conclusion that was contrary to\nPlaintiffs’ expert based on a much smaller sample size.\nReschly only looked at two years of student placements as\nopposed to the five years that Conroy used to reach a\nconclusion about the role of race in LMSD’s placements.\nMoreover, Reschly admitted that his inquiry was hurried and\nthat he did not request additional information required to\nperform the kind of analysis he would otherwise have\nconducted because there was insufficient time. J.A. at 2979.\nId. at 2590.\n\n        Although I do not address the Majority’s rejection of\nPlaintiffs’ appeal of the District Court’s decision to consider\nReschly’s evidence without subjecting it to a Daubert\nhearing, I neither agree with that decision, nor do I\nunderstand why the District Court denied the requested\nDaubert hearing. I do not discuss it in detail because that\nruling has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs offered enough\nevidence to survive summary judgment. If Reschly’s report\ncould withstand a Daubert inquiry, we have a classic battle of\nthe experts that a jury should resolve. If it is not admitted\nunder Daubert, the record still contains a factual issue that\nmust be decided by a jury.\n\n                                37\n\f        I do note that my colleagues misstate the Plaintiffs’\nbasis for challenging the District Court’s denial of their\nrequest for a Daubert hearing. My colleagues suggest that\nPlaintiffs’ objection to Reschly’s report “lies with one\nparagraph.” Majority Op. at 84. That is the District Court’s\nacceptance of Reschly’s definition of “disproportionality.”\nMy colleagues explain their rejection of this claim as follows:\n“[w]e find this use of Reschly’s wording to define\ndisproportionality to be immaterial to the outcome of this\nlitigation.” Id.\n\n        However, there are many more issues with Reschly’s\nreport than the definition of “disproportonality,” and these are\nset forth in the Memorandum of Law filed in support of\nPlaintiffs’ Daubert Motion to Partially Exclude and/or Limit\nthe Report and Testimony of Daniel J. Reschly, Ph.D. J.A. at\n2916. Arguably, there are numerous problems with Reschly’s\nreport, including the fact that he admitted that he did not have\nenough time to conduct the kind of comparison he otherwise\nwould have, the files he compared were selected by agents of\nLMSD, and he only compared two years of class assignments.\n\n       The issue for us is not, of course, which expert is\ncorrect. Rather we should only be concerned with whether\nthis disagreement raises a genuine dispute of material fact.\nThe majority does not believe it does because my colleagues\nsimply reject the statistical evidence supporting the Plaintiffs’\nclaim of bias. That is improper. See Federal Laboratories v.\nBarringer Research, Ltd., 696 F.2d 275, 274 (3d Cir. 1982)\n(“A court may not . . . resolve ‘disputed and relevant factual\nissues on conflicting affidavits of qualified experts.’ Nor is it\nat liberty to disbelieve the good faith statements of experts\ncontained in depositions or affidavits and presented by the\nnon-moving party”) (internal citations omitted).\n\n       Although my colleagues cite to Teamsters v. United\nStates, 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977), they manage to overlook\nthe thrust of the Court’s analysis there. In Teamsters, the\ndefendant employer argued that “statistics can never in and of\nthemselves prove the existence of a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination, or even establish a prima facie case shifting to\nthe employer the burden of rebutting the inference raised by\nthe figures.” 431 U.S. at 338. The Court rejected the\n\n                                38\n\fdefendant’s attempt to minimize the importance of statistical\nanalysis by explaining: “our cases make it unmistakably clear\nthat ‘[s]tatistical analyses have served and will continue to\nserve an important role’ in cases in which the existence of\ndiscrimination is a disputed issue.” 431 U.S. at 338, (brackets\nin original). This is such a case.\n\n        Moreover, the invocation of the maxim that statistics\ncannot “by themselves” establish discriminatory intent,\nshould not obscure the fact that there is “more,” on this\nrecord. There is much more. Thus, even if the opinion of the\nPlaintiffs’ expert could not, by itself, raise an issue of fact, it\nis neither proper nor fair to discuss Plaintiffs’ proof as if they\nwere only relying on that evidence to establish an issue of fact\nabout discriminatory intent under the deliberate indifference\nstandard.\n\nC. Evidence of a “MAP” Program was Improperly\nExcluded and Raises a Dispute of Fact.\n\n        Before discussing the MAP evidence, it is helpful to\nreiterate the nature of the disputed factual issues in this case.\nAs my colleagues readily concede, proof of intent can rarely\nbe achieved by direct evidence. See Majority Op. at 45.\nAccordingly, as noted earlier, “[c]ourts today must be\nincreasingly vigilant in their efforts to ensure that prohibited\ndiscrimination is not approved under the auspices of\nlegitimate conduct, and a plaintiff’s ability, to prove\ndiscrimination [i.e. deliberate indifference rising to the level\nof discriminatory intent] indirectly, circumstantially, must not\nbe crippled . . . because of crabbed notions of relevance or\nexcessive mistrust of juries.” Cort Furniture, 85 F.3d at 1082\n(internal quotation marks omitted, ellipsis in original).\n\n       Moreover, the practical problems of proof in cases\nsuch as this counsel in favor of the same kind of practical\nassessment of proof that the courts have adopted pursuant to\nthe Supreme Court’s McDonnell Douglas burden shifting\nanalysis. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, at 411\nU.S. 792, 802 & n.13 (1973). The District Court\nacknowledged the flexible nature of the proof required to\nestablish a prima facie case. The court explained: “the prima\nfacie case is flexible and must be tailored to fit the specific\n\n                                 39\n\fcontext in which it is applied.” 826 F.3d at 758 (quoting\nSarullo v. U.S. Postal Serv., 352 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir.\n2003)) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Yet,\nthe court’s inquiry was inconsistent with the flexible\napproach the court acknowledged it must adopt.\n\n        With respect to the MAP presentation and the\nattendant authentication testimony from Dr. Barbara Moore-\nWilliams, the District Court and the Majority commit\ndifferent errors. The District Court abused its discretion by\nfailing to admit the MAP presentation because it held that the\ndocument was improperly authenticated under Federal Rule\nof Evidence 901(a). On the other hand, the Majority\nostensibly does not contest the admissibility of the document\nand instead simply holds that it is insufficient to demonstrate\nthat the LMSD intentionally discriminated against plaintiffs.\nSuch a position is problematic because it places an improper\nburden on the Plaintiffs, and again transgresses into fact-\nfinding.      The MAP testimony is admissible and\nadmissibility—not probative weight, is the focus of a\nsummary judgment inquiry.\n\n       As an initial matter, it is important to understand what\nthe MAP presentation is. During discovery, LMSD disclosed\na PowerPoint presentation entitled “Minority Achievement\nProgram” (MAP) on LMSD letterhead dated October 2010\nthat the District Court deemed inadmissible because it was\nnot properly authenticated. That was an abuse of discretion\nthat had a very significant impact on this litigation, and threw\none more obstacle in the path of having a jury determine the\nvalidity of Plaintiffs’ allegations against this school district.\n\n       The MAP “document lists alleged characteristics of\nAfrican-American students, including a preference for ‘tactile\nlearning’ and ‘[s]ubdued lighting’ that they ‘[r]ely heavily on\nvisual input rather than auditory input,’ and that they ‘[r]eact\nintensely to being praised or criticized.’” Blunt, 826\nF.Supp.2d at 761 (brackets in original). The District Court\nrefused to consider the contents of the brochure because “the\nrecord does not reveal who created this document or under\nwhat circumstances and what position the creator or creators\noccupied within the School District. There is no evidence\nthat the purported presentation was ever used.” Id. The\n\n                                40\n\fmajority agrees with the District Court that the fundamental\nproblem with admitting the MAP testimony is the lack of\nevidence that it was used, noting that it “assume[s] the\ncontention that this presentation, if used by LMSD, would\nprovide evidence of discriminatory intent, or deliberate\nindifference to a third party’s discriminatory intent.”\nMajority Op. at 82.\n\n        Dr. Barbara Moore-Williams, Ed. D. is an educational\nconsultant retained by LMSD to assist LMSD in addressing\nissues of racial disparity in educational placements. She was\nretained by LMSD’s Assistant Principal after he saw her give\na presentation at a consortium of area schools. J.A. at 1410.\nHer presentation addressed the issue of “cultural proficiency”\nand educational success “as a national issue.” Id. at 1411.\nAccording to Moore-Williams, the Assistant Principal was\napparently interested in retaining her because he thought her\nwork and information would be helpful to LMSD. Id. at\n1410. Her work focused on “cultural proficiency among staff\nthat teach children who are not their culture, their race, their\nethnicity, and the need to pay attention to African-American\nmales who are struggling in America to get an education . . .\n.” Id.\n\n       The District Court refused to consider the entirety of\nDr. Moore-Williams’s testimony that LMSD “discriminated\nagainst African-Americans” because she also testified that\n“there is racism in all school districts and that Lower Merion\nSchool District’s problems are no different from any other\nsuburban school district.” Blunt, 828 F.Supp.2d at 761.21\nThe District Court thought that Dr. Moore-Williams’\ntestimony was little more than her “personal belief and\nhearsay statements of others.” Id. The District Court\nconcluded that for these reasons, “her statements cannot\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact regarding the School\nDistrict’s intent to discriminate.” Id. My colleagues agree.\n\n21\n   When asked directly whether, based on her experience and\nconversations with LMSD personnel regarding prejudice in\nthe teaching staff, there was any prejudice in the teaching\nstaff, she stated that “[b]ased on [her] experience, there’s\nprejudice in everybody. So, yes, there’s prejudice in the\nLower Merion School District.” J.A. at 1412.\n\n                               41\n\fMajority Op. at 89-90. Regardless, parts of her testimony\nwere nevertheless admissible for the purpose of shedding\nlight on the MAP PowerPoint.\n\n       As I have just noted, that PowerPoint purported to list\nseveral things that were characteristic of the way African-\nAmerican students learn. It stated in part:\n\n      “Many African-American students prefer:\n\n                    more kinesthetic/tactile learning.\n                    subdued lighting rather than bright light.\n                    rely heavily on visual input rather than\n                    auditory input.\n                    respond to cooperative learning.\n                    simultaneous talk instead of alternating\n                    talk.\n                    to study while music or conversation\n                    occurs in the room..\n                    outer-directed rather than egocentric\n                    focus.\n                    more active environments v. sedentary\n                    learning environments of American\n                    Schools.\n                    rely more on information from their\n                    surroundings.\n\nJ.A. at 1838. During her deposition, Moore-Williams was\nasked if she had “ever heard a teacher or a staff member from\nLower Merion School District discuss the use of visual input\nrather than auditory input in their classrooms.” Id. at 1414.\nShe affirmed that she had. Id. She was then asked about each\nof the items listed in the MAP PowerPoint. Id. Counsel\nreferred to them by their place on the list. Id. Although she\nhad not heard teachers refer to each of the bullet points, she\nhad heard teachers refer to some of them. Id. The following\nexchange occurred as counsel took Moore-Williams through\nthe PowerPoint:\n       Q. [W]ith regard to the fourth bullet point concerning\nhighly cooperative learning?\n       A.. Yes.\n       Q. That has been implemented?\n       A. Yes.\n\n                               42\n\f        Q. And has the fifth bullet point concerning\nsimultaneous talk instead alternating      talk           been\nimplemented in Lower Merion School District?\n        A. Yes.\n        Q. And what about the use of music of conversation in\nthe room while studying?\n        A. I haven’t heard.\n        Q. And that was the sixth bullet point. Now, what\nabout the seventh bullet point     concerning the        outer-\ndirected rather than egocentric focus?\n        A. No.\n        Q. And what about the eighth bullet point concerning,\nI believe you said, more active        environments      versus\nsedentary learning environments.?\n        A. Yes.\n        Q. And how have teachers described . . . active\nenvironments versus sedentary      learning environments with\nAfrican-American students in the district?\n        A. Kind of along with cooperative learning, because\ncooperative learning is active.    So it’s in conjunction with,\nwe need to do more things where the kids are up and about\nand interacting with each other.22\nId. at 1414.\n\n        Although Moore-Williams could not corroborate that\nthe MAP PowerPoint presentation had been used in its\nentirety, the District Court abused its discretion by so\nfocusing on the generalities of her beliefs about the extent to\nwhich all public schools are infected with some degree of\nracism that it overlooked the fact that her testimony was\nrelevant to establishing the very fact the District Court found\nlacking - that teachers had adopted the MAP PowerPoint (at\nleast in part).\n\n       My colleagues conclude that because “Dr. Moore-\nWilliams did not testify about the MAP presentation itself,” it\nnecessarily follows that her testimony “does not establish\nwho prepared the presentation, or whether LMSD ever used it\nor for what purpose.” Majority Op. at 83. The conclusion\n\n22\n  “Cooperative learning” is the 14th bullet point on the MAP\nPowerPoint: “Function better under cooperative conditions.”\nJ.A. at 1838.\n\n                               43\n\ffails to consider the detail with which Moore-Williams\nreferred to the presentation.\n\n        More importantly, it does not refute the admissibility\nof the testimony or the presentation. While the District Court\ndisputed the authenticity of the presentation, the Majority\ndoes not identify any such failure to meet the requirements of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 901(a). Perhaps this is because\nauthentication under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a) is an\nincredibly “slight” burden, which may be satisfied by simply\nproducing “evidence sufficient to support a finding that the\nitem is what the proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 901(a).\n\n       My colleagues concede that Moore-Williams\n“indicated that she heard of certain bullet points,” but they\nargue that “she noted that they were not related to African-\nAmerican students. At most, her testimony is relevant to the\nextent that she heard from LMSD personnel that they used\ndifferent teaching strategies for particular students.” Majority\nOp. at 83. My colleagues then dismiss the probative value of\nMoore-Williams’ testimony because she did not testify that\nshe heard teachers specifically connect the MAP strategies to\nAfrican-American students. However, the portion of the\nMAP document quoted above begins with the statement:\n“Many African-American students prefer . . .”. The fact that\nMoore-Williams did not hear teachers mention African-\nAmerican students when discussing the unique learning styles\nsuggested in the MAP presentation is clearly fodder for\ndefense counsel’s closing argument at trial. It is not a reason\nto ignore the existence of a disputed fact. While Moore-\nWilliams’ testimony need only place relevant “dots” into\nevidence, Plaintiffs should be able to rely on the resulting\ninferences to connect them. They should not, however, have\nto explicitly connect all of the dots, color in the resulting\nimage, and frame the picture to survive summary judgment.\nThere is enough on the record to support an inference that the\ndistinct teaching approaches were aimed at African-American\nstudents given the language of the MAP presentation and the\nspecificity of Moore-Williams’ testimony about what she\nheard certain teachers discussing.\n\n      Moore-Williams’ testimony, taken along with the\nevidence itself, clearly supports a reasonable inference that\n\n                                44\n\fLMSD both was a proprietor of and, through their teachers\nand other personnel, used the MAP. The document is on\nLMSD’s letterhead in its header and LMSD supplied it in\ndiscovery. There is no suggestion that it was fabricated, and\nneither the Majority nor the District Court contest the veracity\nof the document. Yet, because Plaintiffs could not identify\nthe author of this document it was deemed inadmissible.\n\n       As a final matter, the Majority contends that the\nDistrict Court properly rejected Moore-Williams’ testimony\nas inadmissible hearsay. Majority Op. at 89-90. However,\nMoore-Williams was testifying about statements teachers\nmade to her about the conclusions in the MAP. It certainly\nappears that the statements were made by teachers acting\nwithin the scope of their duties as teachers at LMSD, and\nneither my colleagues nor the District Court suggest anything\nto the contrary. Accordingly, those statements were not\nhearsay. They were party opponent admissions. See Fed. R.\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(D) (noting that a statement is not hearsay\nwhen “[t]he statement is offered against an opposing party\nand . . . was made by the party’s agent or employee on a\nmatter within the scope of that relationship and while it\nexisted.”).\n\nD. Testimony of Psychologists and Parents Supports\nPlaintiffs’ Contention that Race is a Factor in Assigning\nStudents to Special Education Classes\n\n        Plaintiffs produced the expert Rebuttal Report of\nTawanna J. Jones, Ed. S. Certified School Psychologist. See\nid. at 2306. Her Curriculum Vitae was attached to her report,\nand her expertise in the appropriate areas is not disputed.23\nShe was retained by Plaintiffs to rebut the expert report of\nReschly, LMSD’s expert. Jones was specifically asked to\n\n23\n   Jones was then serving as a Certified School Psychologist\nfor the School District of Philadelphia. Her primary\nresponsibilities included evaluating students and determining\neligibility for Special Education Services. She was also a\ncollaborative team member working to ensure proper student\nplacement, provision of adequate services, “development of\nappropriate behavioral and academic goals, and transition\nplanning for post-secondary options.” J.A. at 2306.\n\n                                45\n\fgive her expert opinion about “whether: (1) each of the\nstudent Plaintiffs were properly identified by [LMSD] as\nhaving a learning disability; (2) based on LMSD’s placement\nof each student Plaintiffs [sic] into low level and/or special\neducation classes, were the student Plaintiffs denied the\nequality of education they should have otherwise received . . .\n.” Id. at 2307-08. Jones found that the students whose files\nshe reviewed were erroneously evaluated by the school\ndistrict. See J.A. at 2318-20. Specifically, as discussed\nbelow, three of the plaintiffs, Q.G, C.H., and S.H., were\nincorrectly placed in special education courses although they\ndid not meet the criteria for placement in those courses. Id.\nJones’s testimony is corroborated and supported by the\ntestimony of Dr. Barbara Shapiro, Ph.D. the Assistant\nDirector of Pupil Services, who supervised school\npsychologists at LMSD.\n\n        Jones opined that Plaintiff Q.G., an African-American\nstudent at LMSD, “was incorrectly identified by LMSD as a\nstudent who met the criteria for a Learning Disability in the\narea of Language Arts.” Id. at 2318. She added: “[a]s an\ninitial matter of import, Language Arts is not a disability\ncategory.” Id. at 2318 (emphasis in original). Thus, even\nassuming the accuracy of LMSD’s conclusion that Q.G. was\ndeficient in Language Arts, according to the undisputed\ntestimony of Plaintiffs’ expert, that should not have resulted\nin Q.G. being placed in special education classes. Q.G.’s\nacademic skills then declined over time “after being placed in\nSpecial Education.” Id. at 2319 (emphasis in original).\n\n       The dubious nature of Q.G.’s placement based on a\nsingle deficiency is corroborated by the testimony of Shapiro.\nShapiro began working in the LMSD in the fall of 2003 as\nAssistant Director of Pupil Services. J.A. at 1387. She\nsupervised ten school psychologists in that capacity until\nMarch 1, 2009, during that time she “collaborated with the\nspecial ed supervisors regarding special ed services district\nwide.” Id.\n\n       Shapiro testified that no student should ever be placed\ninto special education classes based on one score. Id. at\n1393. “As a psychologist, you would look at the entire\npicture of a child and never just determine a disability based\n\n\n                               46\n\fon one piece of information.” Id. Yet, that was not the\nprocess used to place Q.G. in special education classes that\nshe did not need, and which impeded her educational\ndevelopment.\n\n       Shapiro also testified that LMSD did not comply with\nthe American Psychological Association’s protocol for record\nretention. J.A. at 1397. This meant that testing protocols that\ndetermined students’ placement in classes were sometimes\ndestroyed before parents could examine (and thereby\nchallenge) them. Although parents were informed that they\nhad a right to request these protocols, Shapiro did not believe\nthat parents were ever informed of this shortened retention\npolicy. The result was that parents would often ask to see\ntheir child’s testing protocols, only to learn they had already\nbeen disposed of. Id.24\n\n       Jones also opined that the initial evaluation for another\nAfrican-American student, Plaintiff C.H., “provided a clear\nindication, that there were deficits and needs in the areas of\nReading Comprehension and Basic reading skills (reading\ndecoding).” However, “[t]here was no evidence, . . . that she\nmet the criteria for SLD [specific learning disability] in the\narea of Written Expression or Mathematics.” Id. at 2319.\nJones believed that the absence of data made it impossible to\ngive C.H. the support she needed to address the one area\nwhere she appeared deficient, and still allow her to progress\nnormally in the areas where the need for such support was not\nindicated. Id. at 2319-20.\n\n       Jones’ evaluation of yet another student, Plaintiff S.H.,\nmay be the most troubling. “All of S.H.’s skills and abilities\nmeasured in the ‘Average’ range at the point of the initial\nassessment . . . . Despite the lack of evidence required to\ndetermine eligibility, the evaluator labeled S.H. as meeting\nthe criteria for a SLD and subsequently doomed S.H. to an\nacademic experience [in special ed – low expectation courses]\n\n24\n   I mention this evidence merely to illustrate the extent to\nwhich Plaintiffs raised genuine disputes of material facts\nregarding those claims and they should have been resolved by\na fact finder. I am not suggesting that this necessarily proves\nnefarious conduct by LMSD employees.\n\n                                47\n\fthat impeded her development rather than remediated or\naccelerated her academic progress.” Id. at 2320. According\nto Dr. Jones, “[i]t is evident from the data provided that S.H.\nwas never a candidate for Special Education under the\nauspices of a SLD.” Id. In her view, “[i]t is apparent that\nsubsequent evaluators either were not aware of the criteria for\na SLD or intentionally chose to ignore the criteria as\ndemonstrated by the fact that S.H.’s not initially meeting the\ncriteria for SLD was never subsequently addressed by\nLMSD.” Id.\n\n       S.H.’s mother testified that she did not believe her\ndaughter was denied educational services per se, but was\ntroubled because S.H. was placed in lower level courses that\nwere not demanding. S.H.’s mother did not initially object to\nthe placement because she received letters from LMSD\ninforming her that S.H. was receiving reading support, which\nS.H.’s mother interpreted as giving her daughter extra help.\nShe said that “[N]obody in the school told [her] that it was a\nremedial course, no. I just thought it was an enrichment. It\nwas presented as an enrichment course to help kids with\nreading. So, to me, more is better.” 25 Id. at 1165. Like most\nof the parents here, S.H.’s mother did not initially object\nbecause she trusted the school officials and assumed they\nwere acting in S.H.’s best interests. S.H.’s mother testified\nthat she finally objected to S.H.’s placement after an\nindependent psychologist evaluated S.H. in tenth grade and\nconcluded that S.H. did not have a learning disability.\nAccording to the mother, the school then gave her\n“pushback.” Id. at 1167; see generally, id. at 1153-67. This\npushback demonstrates that the school was aware of the\nissues involved in S.H.’s placement, and responded in a\nmanner that a jury could conclude was deliberately\nindifferent.\n\n      The differing kinds of omissions and irregularities\nevidenced by Dr. Jones’ assessment of the placements of\nQ.G., C.H., S.H., as well as Shapiro’s testimony, reflect some\n\n25\n   Although the District Court held that S.H.’s mother’s\ntestimony was inadmissible with respect to other issues (third\nhand accounts of teachers’ statements to students), this\ntestimony does not provide any such problem.\n\n                               48\n\fof the difficulties in the way this case has been litigated as\nwell as some of the conceptual difficulties and confusion\ninherent in the litigation posture here. Indeed, counsel for\nCBP addressed this concern at oral argument:\n\n       The general confusion in this case is that\n       initially there were special-education claims in\n       the case; those claims were dismissed because\n       of failure to exhaust. There were also Title VI\n       claims. What happened was, through the course\n       of discovery and though the process of\n       evaluations, the children discovered that . . .\n       most of them had never had the disabilities that\n       the district said they had.26\n\nTranscript of Oral Argument at 17, Blunt v. Lower Merion\nSchool District, --F.3d-- (Nos. 11-4200, 11-4201, 11-4315).\nAt the risk of repetition: “the totality of the evidence . . . must\nguide our analysis rather than the strength of each individual\nargument.” Bray v. Marriott Hotels, 110 F.3d 986, 991 (3d\nCir. 1997).\n\n        In response to this glaring evidence in support of\nPlaintiffs’ claims that they were placed into special education\nclasses because of their race rather than their relative\nacademic need, the Majority simply makes a blanket assertion\nthat “if the same evaluation procedures are used for all\nstudents or [sic] their race there is simply no discrimination.”\nMajority Op. at 93. This statement is deeply problematic for\ntwo reasons. First, it assumes that the procedures themselves\ncannot be discriminatory. Second, and most importantly here, it\nassumes the “procedures” comprise the whole of the evaluation,\n\n26\n   The District Court commented on what it must have seen as\na “moving target” by noting: “[i]n their brief in opposition to\nthe motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs now assert that\nthey are not disabled and were wrongly placed in special\neducation programs on the basis of race. This assertion that\nthey are not disabled is in stark contrast to the Third\nAmended Complaint . . .” Blunt, 826 F.Supp.2d at 753.\nHowever, for purposes of deciding the summary judgment\nmotion, the District Court assumed that the student plaintiffs\nwere “in fact not disabled.” Id. at 754 n.4.\n\n                                 49\n\fthus ignoring the discretion and subjectivity afforded the examiner\nwho is applying the procedures and interpreting the results of the\nevaluations.\n\n       As noted above, clearly the procedures were not\napplied appropriately with respect to Plaintiffs. LMSD’s own\nAssistant Director of Pupil Services testified that procedures\nwere not followed, including those for dictating which\nstudents should be placed in special education classes. See\nsupra at 71-72. For instance, as noted above, LMSD\nevaluated Q.G. as having a learning disability in the subject\nof language arts, which is not even a disability category. J.A.\nat 2318. This directly belies the Majority’s broad assertion\nthat as long as the procedures are neutral, the consequences\ncannot, as a matter of law, be considered discriminatory.\nSimilar procedures and evaluative tools can always be applied\nin patently discriminatory ways, and evidence of their\nmisapplication with respect to the Plaintiffs is certainly\nevidence of discrimination and deliberate indifference. See\ninfra n. 16 at 34.\n\n       It is, of course, possible to argue that the errors in\nplacement on this record are simply the result of the district’s\nless than desirable and inartful method of selecting students\nfor special education classes. Mistakes can surely happen,\nespecially in such a complicated, subtle and intricate process\nas identifying students who cannot handle regular academic\nwork in a classroom. However, LMSD had every opportunity\nto come forward with evidence that numbers of White\nstudents are also mistakenly placed in special education\nclasses and that could have negated the causal nexus of the\nerroneous placement of these African-American plaintiffs. It\noffered no such evidence.\n\n       Even if it could be argued that the decision to forego\nproduction of any such evidence results from political\nconsiderations rather than absence of such proof (and nothing\non this record supports such rank speculation), the fact\nremains that this record only contains evidence of African-\nAmerican students erroneously being labeled as “learning\ndisabled” and being denied the full benefits of a public\neducation. There is no evidence of this happening with White\nstudents and the inference that Plaintiffs are entitled to should\n\n\n                                 50\n\fprevent the LMSD from getting an evidentiary bye.\nMoreover, to the extent that innocent mistakes happen in\nplacement, it should be noted that, where the more\nchallenging curricula is concerned, all such mistakes seem to\nhappen in only one direction. There were no African-\nAmerican students in “high expectation,” college prep or\nadvanced placement classes in the school district during the\nyears the experts studied. Speculation about diagnostic error\nis simply that—“speculation;” it should play no role in our\nlegal inquiry.\n\nF.  There is Testimony that Teachers and School\nAdministrators Had Notice of These Allegations\n\n        Plaintiffs have also put forward sufficient evidence of\ndeliberate indifference. They established that LMSD was\naware of the racial problems arising from the classroom\nassignments and provision of resources, and it ignored\nPlaintiffs’ requests to remedy the racial disparities. As noted\nin the section on CBP’s standing above, Ms. Metzger, a\nformer special education teacher at LMSD, testified that as a\nteacher she “was invited to and sat in on a portion of a\nConcerned Black Parents conversation with some of the\nschool administrators.” J.A. at 1456. At this meeting, parents\nand students raised concerns that “African-American\nstudents, as a whole, as we have discussed, were not\nperforming at the same rate, not experiencing the same\nsuccess as other students; that [African American families in\nthe District] believed that [African American] students didn’t\nfeel welcome in the school; that [African American families\nin the District] believed that at times, guidance counselors or\nothers, personnel, maybe didn’t afford the same consideration\nwhen it came to the college planning process.” Id. (emphasis\nadded). As Metzger’s testimony makes clear, the “school\nadministrators” who attended this meeting along with her had\nnotice that African American families had complained that\nthey were not receiving the same education as their peers,\nand, yet, nothing changed.\n\n        In addition, as I discussed above, when the mother of\none of these plaintiffs objected to her daughter being\nidentified as having a learning disability, the school gave her\n“pushback,” rather than undertaking an inquiry into the\n\n                               51\n\fappropriateness of her daughter’s placement in special\neducation. J.A. at 1167.\n\n                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe all recognize the difficulty of identifying students who are\nbest served by the kind of remediation that special education\nclasses are intended to provide. and that no process of\nevaluation is perfect. However, this case is not about second-\nguessing the placement of students in remedial classes. It is\nnot about frustrated hopes of parents or students. And,\ndespite the specter of the The Quota Boogeyman raised by the\nMajority,27 it is not about how many African-American\nstudents should be placed in a particular academic track.\n\n       This case is about whether courts will allow plaintiffs\nwho have produced the kind of proof that I have discussed\nabove to survive summary judgment and have their day in\ncourt to prove something as subjective and evasive as the\ndeliberate indifference that is tantamount to racial bias.\n\n       When plaintiffs can produce the kind of evidence that\nhas been produced here, the law requires that their ultimate\nclaims of bias be determined by a fact finder, not by a court.\nAs Judge Baylson stated in Doe 1 v. Lower Merion Sch.\nDist.:“The Supreme Court has clarified that [d]etermining\nwhether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating\nfactor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent as may be available.” 689 F.\nSupp. 2d at 755. (emphasis in original, internal quotation\nmarks omitted). That is sorely lacking here.\n\n        I also note the laudable caution of Judge Baylson in\nDoe 1, in explaining: “[this] Court is particularly reluctant to\ngrant summary judgment and to deny Plaintiffs the right to\ntrial in this case, which involves issues of public policy and\ngreat concern to the community.” Id.\n\n\n27\n  See Majority Op. at 94 (“We certainly are not going to\nrequire or even suggest that school districts use a quota\nsystem in assigning students to special education classes [to\nachieve proportionality].”).\n\n                                52\n\f        I therefore must respectfully disagree with my\ncolleagues’ belief that the District Court did not err in\nconcluding that no genuine dispute of material fact exists on\nthis record.\n\n\n\n\n                              53\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n        In what may be an oversimplification, we introduce our\nopinion on this appeal by setting forth that the central\ncontroversy is a dispute over whether African American students\nin the Lower Merion School District (“LMSD”) public schools\nin Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, were deprived of\nappropriate educational services due to racial discrimination and\nsegregation in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs\nunsuccessfully brought this action pursuant to the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et\nseq.; the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n\n                               9\n\f§§ 12101, 12132; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the\n“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (“Title VI”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and\nstate law, claiming that African American students in the LMSD\nsuffered from such discrimination.1 They now appeal from\nportions of the District Court’s orders on federal issues entered\n\n1\n  During the course of the District Court proceedings, plaintiffs,\nbased on a then recent examination by a psychologist, asserted\nthat five or six of the student plaintiffs had been identified\nincorrectly as being learning disabled. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 12, 14, 19, 36. Therefore, at oral argument before us\nthe parties focused on the Title VI and § 1983 claims, as the\nDistrict Court had held that the IDEA, ADA and RA were\ninapplicable to the claims of the plaintiffs who by then\ncontended that they wrongly had been identified. The plaintiffs’\narguments were further limited because the IDEA, ADA, and\nRA claims of all individual plaintiffs except those of one family,\nthe Blunts, were dismissed as a result of their failure to exhaust\nIDEA administrative remedies. Recently, however, in a related\ncase, S.H. v. Lower Merion School District, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\nCir. 2013), involving litigants who also are parties to this action,\nwe held that students incorrectly identified as learning disabled\nmay not bring claims under the IDEA, though they still may\nhave claims under the RA and the ADA. Id. at 257, 260-61.\nBut, as far as we can ascertain, Amber Blunt, a student plaintiff,\nand her parents continue to press their original claims under the\nIDEA. Consequently, we address a statute of limitations issue\nrelating to their IDEA claims even though Amber now claims\nthat she is not learning disabled.\n\n\n                                10\n\fat various times during the course of the litigation. We,\nhowever, are not concerned with the substance of the state law\nclaims on this appeal as the District Court did not exercise\njurisdiction over those claims.\n\n       This case encompasses a myriad of legal issues, including\nstanding to bring suit, application of a statute of limitations, res\njudicata (claim preclusion), application of disability laws,\nappropriateness of education provided to students, anti-\ndiscrimination laws, and sections of the Code of Federal\nRegulations implementing the applicable laws. The case on\nappeal also includes a cross-appeal by the LMSD, but we will\ndismiss the cross-appeal without deciding it on the merits as it is\nmoot. The District Court found that the plaintiffs did not\npresent sufficient evidence to survive LMSD’s motion for\nsummary judgment on the discrimination charges and the Court\ndismissed plaintiffs’ other claims for other reasons. Thus, the\nCourt did not find that there had been any violations of federal\nlaw.\n\n       Plaintiffs, now appellants, appeal from the District\nCourt’s October 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order\ngranting a final summary judgment to defendant LMSD and\nagainst all the plaintiffs in the case remaining at the time that the\nCourt granted summary judgment, the Court already having\ndismissed several of the parties and claims from the case by\nprevious orders.2 Appellants also appeal from rulings in two\n\n2\n  Throughout the opinion we sometimes refer to the plaintiffs\nand appellants collectively even though two different groups of\nplaintiffs filed separate appeals which have been consolidated\n\n                                 11\n\fintermediate orders that became final at the time of the entry of\nthe October 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order,\nnamely: the dismissal of all claims of plaintiffs, now appellants,\nAmber Blunt, a now former student at LMSD, and Crystal and\nMichael Blunt, her parents, in the District Court’s memorandum\nand order of February 15, 2008, the “February 15, 2008 Order”;\nthe dismissal of all plaintiffs’ claims against the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Education (“PDE”) in the District Court’s order\nand memorandum of August 19, 2009, the “August 19, 2009\nOrder”; and the dismissal of plaintiff Concerned Black Parents\nof Mainline Inc. (“CBP”) as a party in the District Court’s\nAugust 19, 2009 Order for lack of standing. Appellants’ No.\n11-4201 br. at 1.\n\n        Plaintiffs, with the exception of the CBP and the\nmainline branch of the NAACP (the “NAACP”), are present and\npast African American students of the Lower Merion Township\npublic schools, who were placed in remedial classes after being\nidentified as learning “disabled” under the IDEA and/or those\nstudents’ parents. The plaintiffs repeatedly used the term\n“disabled” to describe the student plaintiffs throughout the\npleadings, a term consistent with the IDEA, a statute under\nwhich they were making claims, as the IDEA safeguards the\n\nalong with the cross-appeal of the LMSD. Though LMSD is a\ncross-appellant we do not include it when we refer to appellants.\n We usually refer to the parties who brought this action as\nplaintiffs when describing proceedings in the District Court and\nas appellants when describing proceedings in this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\frights of disabled students. Nevertheless, at this stage in the\nlitigation some appellants argue that the LMSD incorrectly\nidentified them as learning disabled,3 thereby causing them\ninjury.4 Appellants claim that their placement in remedial\n\n3\n Even though by the time that the District Court considered the\nmotion for summary judgment most of the student plaintiffs\nremaining in the case asserted that they had been misidentified\nas learning disabled, the pleadings continued to identify the\nstudents as learning disabled. In rendering its opinion on the\nsummary judgment motion, notwithstanding the pleadings, the\nCourt assumed with two exceptions that the student plaintiffs\nwere not disabled. We also note that Appellants’ No. 11-4201\nbr. at 1 n.2 recites that the correct name of Concerned Black\nParents of Mainline Inc. is simply Concerned Black Parents, Inc.\n4\n    The Code of Federal Regulations sets forth that:\n\n         Child with a disability means a child evaluated in\n         accordance with §§ 300.304 through 300.311 as having\n         mental retardation, a hearing impairment (including\n         deafness), a speech or language impairment, a visual\n         impairment (including blindness), a serious emotional\n         disturbance (referred to in this part as ‘emotional\n         disturbance’), an orthopedic impairment, autism,\n         traumatic brain injury, an other [sic] health impairment, a\n         specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple\n         disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, needs special\n         education and related services.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.8(a)(1).\n\n\n                                 13\n\fclasses had a negative impact on their opportunity for\neducational advancement, but by the time of the proceedings on\nthe motion for summary judgment they were seeking relief in\nthe District Court only pursuant to Title VI and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment through 42\nU.S.C. § 1983. Appellants’ case is largely based on their\ncontention that the disproportionate placement of African\nAmerican students in remedial classes had a discriminatory\npurpose and was the result of racial bias.5\n\n       Ultimately, the summary judgment question turns on\nwhether there is enough record evidence to establish that LMSD\nintentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs, whether\nthrough its own actions or by failing to correct a third party’s\n\n\n\n5\n  Initially, the individually named students sought to bring their\nclaims on their own behalf and on behalf of the students\nsimilarly situated as a class action; however, the District Court\nruled that class certification was inappropriate due to the highly\nindividualized aspects of each student’s claims. (No. 2:07-cv-\n3100, Doc. No. 124). At oral argument, one appellants’\nattorney acknowledged that the District Court had been correct\nin not certifying the case as a class action (Tr. Oral Arg. June\n11, 2013, at 6:18-21, 14:4-7 (“You can’t remedy it as a class\naction . . . because of the individual issues.”)), and thus\nappellants no longer seek to proceed in this case on a class\naction basis.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fintentional discrimination. Looking at the whole record, which\nincludes statistical evidence showing that minorities are\noverrepresented in low achievement classes, we conclude that\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact concerning LMSD’s\nintent. There is no evidence showing that the District intended\nto discriminate against plaintiffs, nor that LMSD had knowledge\nof any intentional discrimination on the part of its employees,\nincluding deliberate indifference to discriminatory practices\nagainst African American students as a form of intentional\ndiscrimination. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s\ngrant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n        II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       This suit has had many plaintiffs and defendants, though\nsome have come and gone, and includes many related issues and\nclaims.6 We now are dealing with what is left of this litigation\n6\n  The District Court’s docket sheets lists numerous cases with\nseparate numbers as being related to this action. It is\nparticularly significant that in a related case, S.H. v. Lower\nMerion School District, No. 2:10-cv-06070, in the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania involving two of the same litigants that\nare parties in this case, Carol Durrell and her daughter,\nidentified in that case as “S.H.” and in this case as “Saleema\nHall,” that we have decided an appeal in a precedential opinion.\n See S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n2013). Saleema Hall is identified as a litigant in the most recent\nversion of the complaint in this case in the caption as is her\nsister, Chantae Hall and her mother, Carol Durrell.\n\n                               15\n\fby entertaining the present appeals which have been\nconsolidated with the cross-appeal in this Court under No. 11-\n4200.7\n\n       The plaintiffs filed the original complaint on July 30,\n2007. At that time the plaintiffs were current or former students\nin the LMSD, four parents, and the two organizations that we\nhave identified.8 The original defendants were the LMSD and\n\n       We note that S.H. changed her theory of recovery in the\nother action from her theory in this case, although she filed it\nunder the same statutes based on the same set of facts on which\nshe previously had relied in this case. Her theory in the other\naction was that she is not and never has been learning disabled\nand was placed improperly in special education classes. Id. at\n255-56. Other student plaintiffs in this case have asserted the\nsame theory of liability (incorrect identification as learning\ndisabled), but inasmuch as Saleema Hall and Carroll Durell have\nnot withdrawn as plaintiffs in this litigation (they were named in\nthe third amended complaint) it appears that they press their\nclaims in the two cases on both theories though they are\ninconsistent.\n7\n   DLA Piper, LLP and the Public Interest Law Center of\nPhiladelphia represent separate groups of appellants and have\nfiled separate briefs on their behalf. For the sake of clarity we\nwill distinguish between their briefs on the basis of the appeal\nnumbers.\n8\n The original plaintiffs were Amber Blunt, on behalf of herself\nand all others similarly situated; Crystal Blunt and Michael\nBlunt, on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly\n\n                               16\n\ftwo of its officials in their official capacity.9 No. 2:07-cv-3100,\nDoc. No. 1.10\n\n      The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on\nSeptember 26, 2007, adding three plaintiffs (two current or\nformer students in the LMSD and one parent)11 and several\n\nsituated; Linda Johnson, on her own behalf, on behalf of her\ndaughter, Lydia Johnson, and all others similarly situated; Carol\nDurrell, on her own behalf, on behalf of her minor daughter,\nSaleema Hall, and on behalf of all others similarly situated;\nChristine Dudley, on her own behalf, and on behalf of her minor\nson, Walter Whiteman, and on behalf of all others similarly\nsituated; Eric Allston on his own behalf and on behalf of all\nothers similarly situated; Concerned Black Parents, Inc.; and the\nMainline Branch of the NAACP. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No.\n1.\n9\n The officials were Jamie Savedoff, Superintendent, and\nMichael Kelly, Director of Pupil Services. No. 2:07-cv-3100,\nDoc. No. 1.\n\n\n10\n   Though the parties sometimes have used the term “the\nDistrict” to refer to the LMSD, because this usage may be\nconfusing inasmuch as we regularly refer to the District Court,\nwe have used the term “LMSD.”\n11\n  Chantae Hall, the daughter of Carroll Durrell and sister of\nSaleema Hall, both of whom were parties in the original\ncomplaint, was added as were June Coleman, on her own behalf\n\n                                17\n\fdefendants, including the Lower Merion School Board, its\nPresident, Vice President, and various members of the Board\n(together, the “School Board”), the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation (the “PDE”), and two of its officials. No. 2:07-cv-\n3100, Doc. No. 10. Inasmuch as the LMSD and the School\nBoard have the same interest in this case and are represented by\nthe same attorneys, we sometimes refer to them together as the\nLMSD. The plaintiffs named the PDE as a defendant because\nthey believed that it failed to meet the supervisory, monitoring\nand compliance procedural obligations that federal law imposed\non it. The FAC concerned, inter alia, as appellants indicate in\none of their briefs, “a decision of the Pennsylvania Special\nEducation Due Process Appeals Review Panel (the ‘Appeals\nPanel’) pursuant to the IDEA.” Appellants’ No. 11-4201 br. at\n8-9;12 see also J.A. vol. 2, at 91-151. As stated above, the\n\n\nand on behalf of her minor son, Richard “Ricky” Coleman, and\non behalf of all others similarly situated.\n12\n   The brief further explains that Crystal and Michael Blunt are\nthe parents of Amber Blunt, a 2005 graduate of Lower Merion\nHigh School who “was identified as a student with a Specific\nLearning Disability.” Appellants’ No. 11-4201 br. at 8-9. The\nBlunts sought payment by LMSD for the tuition for a six-week\nremedial program that West Chester University required Amber\nto take as a condition of her admission. Id. The Blunts argued\nthat the LMSD “should pay for this program to compensate for\nthe fact that it failed to develop and implement transition\nservices for Amber as required by the IDEA.” Id. The Blunts\nalso were dissatisfied that Amber was not admitted into her first\nchoice college, Temple University, although two of the three\n\n                               18\n\foriginal complaint alleged that the defendants violated the\nIDEA, 34 C.F.R. § 300.600 (regarding the monitoring\nrequirements imposed on states receiving federal funds for\neducation of students with disabilities), the ADA, § 504 of the\nRA, Title VI, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, all premised on the theory\nthat plaintiffs had learning disabilities for which LMSD had not\nmade adequate provisions. The FAC invoked the same legal\ntheories/statutes as the original complaint. J.A. vol. 2, at 91-\n151.\n\n       On October 8, 2007, LMSD and the School Board filed a\nmotion to dismiss the FAC, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed\nto exhaust their administrative remedies, the CBP and NAACP\ndid not have standing, and the FAC failed to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. They also contended that the\nIDEA action was untimely. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 11.\n\n        On November 19, 2007, the PDE filed a motion to\ndismiss the FAC for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.13 No.\n2:07-cv-3100, Doc. Nos. 21-22; J.A. vol. 2, at 284. PDE argued\nthat the Blunt plaintiffs’ claims fell outside the IDEA’s statute\nof limitations and that the other individual student plaintiffs had\nnot exhausted their administrative remedies under the IDEA. Id.\n The PDE further argued that its sovereign immunity barred the\n\ncolleges to which she applied did admit her.\n13\n  Gerald Zohorchak and John Tommasini, who were named in\ntheir official capacities as officers of PDE, joined in this motion\nbut they no longer are parties to this suit, and appellants do not\nchallenge their dismissal.\n\n\n                                19\n\fstate law claims asserted against it, and that plaintiffs had failed\nto state a claim upon which relief could be granted against it.\nId.\n\n        On February 15, 2008, the District Court entered an order\ndismissing various plaintiffs and claims from the FAC. The\nCourt methodically eliminated each federal law claim that the\nBlunt plaintiffs made against each defendant. In particularly\nsignificant holdings that we address at length below, the Court\nheld that a 90-day statute of limitations in the IDEA barred the\nBlunts’ claims under the IDEA, RA, and ADA and that a\nseparate two-year statute of limitations barred their other claims.\n Consequently, the order dismissed the Blunts’ federal claims in\ntheir entirety, although their state law claims remained. See No.\n2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 9; see also J.A. vol. I, at 42.42-42.45.\nThe Court also determined that the individual plaintiffs, other\nthan the Blunts, had not sought an administrative remedy for\ntheir IDEA claims, and therefore it dismissed the IDEA claims\nof the remaining individual plaintiffs against the LMSD\ndefendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.16. However, the Court found that the individual plaintiffs\ndid not need to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to\ntheir claims against the PDE because Pennsylvania regulations\nprovide for administrative resolution of disputes between\nstudents, their parents, and their representatives and school\ndistricts, but do not provide for administrative resolution of\nsimilar disputes with the Commonwealth. Id. at 42.17.\n\n      The District Court also dismissed plaintiffs’ ADA and\nRA claims (other than the Blunts’ claims) against the LMSD and\nthe School Board for failure to exhaust their administrative\n\n\n                                20\n\fremedies, reasoning that the claims were based on the same\nallegations as plaintiffs’ IDEA claims and that, if the plaintiffs\nwere entitled to relief, it would have been available through the\nIDEA administrative dispute process. Id. at 42.18-42.19. The\nCourt noted that “[t]he parties agree[d]” regarding the\nexhaustion requirement for those claims. Id. The Court found,\nhowever, that the IDEA exhaustion requirement did not bar\nplaintiffs’ claims under Title VI because, unlike the IDEA, Title\nVI does not “focus on ‘the rights of children with disabilities.’”\nId. at 42.19. The Court also did not find that the plaintiffs\nneeded to exhaust their § 1983 claims administratively.\n\n        In addition, as we indicated above, the District Court\nconcluded that the NAACP and CBP lacked standing as\nplaintiffs.14 Id. at 42.33. The Court also found that the counts\nagainst individual defendants in their official capacity (as\nrepresentatives of the other defendants, LMSD, the School\nBoard and PDE) were duplicative, and therefore it dismissed the\nFAC against those individuals to “simplify[ ] the litigation in a\nway that does not cause any prejudice to plaintiffs.”15 Id. at\n42.35-42.36.\n\n14\n   Although the NAACP attempted in the next version of the\ncomplaint to allege facts to support its standing, as we already\nhave indicated it does not appeal from the holding that it does\nnot have standing. On the other hand, CBP has appealed from\nthe order dismissing it from the case because of its lack of\nstanding.\n15\n   The appellants have not appealed from this ruling and we\ntherefore will not discuss it further.\n\n                               21\n\f       The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”)\non July 8, 2008, adding two plaintiffs, one parent and one\nstudent.16 No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 49. The SAC, in accord\nwith the District Court’s February 15, 2008 Order, removed as\ndefendants the School Board members previously so-named in\ntheir official capacities. But the SAC continued to name the\nSchool Board in its caption though it did not make allegations\nagainst the School Board in its body. The SAC, however,\nincluded the PDE and two of its officials as defendants. The\nSAC continued to name the Blunts as plaintiffs, despite the\ncircumstance that the Court had dismissed all of their federal\nclaims in its February 15, 2008 Order.17 The SAC also added\nseveral paragraphs discussing the CBP’s alleged increase of\nexpenditures that it attributed to “the inferior quality of LMSD’s\ndual system of education.” Moreover, the SAC named several\npersons who the CBP claimed were members of that\norganization in a clear attempt to demonstrate that the CBP had\nstanding. SAC at 34-36. In addition, the SAC added six\nparagraphs regarding plaintiff NAACP’s expenditure of\n\n16\n  The added plaintiffs were Lynda Muse, on behalf of herself\nand her minor son, Quiana Griffin, and on behalf of all others\nsimilarly situated. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 49.\n17\n   In contending that the District Court had jurisdiction,\nplaintiffs argued that “[t]he Blunt Plaintiffs have fully exhausted\ntheir administrative remedies under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §\n1415; the other individual Plaintiffs are excused from doing so\nbecause such efforts would be futile.” No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc.\nNos. 9, 55; J.A. vol. 2, at 95.\n\n\n                                22\n\fresources in addressing alleged issues with the LMSD.

The plaintiffs remained the same in the\nTAC as previously except that one parent was no longer a\nplaintiff.19 The TAC, however, no longer named two officials\nof the School Board as defendants, and it did not name the\nofficials of the PDE that the plaintiffs previously had named as\ndefendants. The TAC continued to list the School Board as a\nnamed defendant in the caption, and the PDE and LMSD\nremained named defendants in both the caption and the body of\nthe TAC.20 Despite the District Court’s dismissal of all of the\n\n18\n  Inasmuch as the NAACP is no longer a party in this litigation,\nthese paragraphs are now immaterial.\n\n\n19\n  Linda Johnson, the parent of Lydia Johnson, was dropped as a\nplaintiff in the TAC. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 55; J.A. vol.\n9, 3847-97. Nevertheless, she was listed as an appellant in the\nnotice of appeal.\n20\n     Specifically, in the introduction to the TAC:\n\n         3. Plaintiffs assert that LMSD routinely misuses so-\n         called below grade level programs and modified classes\n         to remove African American students from the general\n         education curriculum, in some instances to avoid\n         evaluating a student’s eligibility for services under the\n\n                                 23\n\fBlunts’ federal claims in the complaint in its February 15, 2008\nOrder, the TAC included them again in Count VI against the\nLMSD and the School Board pursuant to the Pennsylvania\nPublic School Code, 22 Pa. Code §14.102 et. seq.21 Plaintiffs\n\n       IDEA. Plaintiffs further assert that LMSD intentionally\n       segregates these African American students in classes\n       that are taught below grade level while depriving them of\n       grade-level subject matter and materials that are provided\n       to their Caucasian peers at all educational levels.\n\n       4.     Plaintiffs also assert that the Pennsylvania\n       Department of Education (PDE) failed to enforce the\n       IDEA’s mandate that it ensure that children with\n       disabilities receive an appropriate education in the least\n       restrictive environment and that African American\n       children in the LMSD are not inappropriately over-\n       identified or disproportionately placed in special\n       education classes. By their claims against PDE,\n       Plaintiffs seek to remedy wide-spread violations of the\n       Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the\n       Fourteenth Amendment . . . the IDEA, the [ADA],\n       [Section 504 of the RA], [Title VI] and Section 1983 of\n       the Civil Rights Act of 18971 [sic].\n\nTAC at 2-3; J.A. vol. 9, at 3848-49.\n21\n   Several pages of the alleged factual basis for the Blunts’\nclaims, appearing in the “Parties” section of the SAC, were\ndeleted in the TAC, and the identification of Amber and her\nparents as “African American” was added to that section.

The PDE filed an answer to the TAC on\nAugust 19, 2008. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 58.\n\n        On August 15, 2008, the LMSD and the School Board\nfiled a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings addressed to\nthe Blunts’ remaining state law claims, which the Blunts\nformally opposed on August 29, 2008. J.A. vol. 3, at 561-72,\n575-89. The District Court issued a Memorandum and Order on\nNovember 18, 2008, (the “November 18, 2008 Order”), in\nwhich it noted that the motion incorrectly had been styled as a\nmotion for partial judgment on the pleadings, when it was really\na motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The\nCourt granted the motion,22 finding that it did not have\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the Blunts’ state law claims and\n22\n   The District Court noted that there was little overlap of the\noperative facts of Amber Blunt’s claims with the claims of the\nother plaintiffs, as the claims involved different time periods,\ndifferent treatment, and possibly different schools. J.A. vol. 3,\nat 602. In this regard, the Court noted that “each of the student-\nplaintiffs presents an entirely different factual predicate for his\nor her claims.” Id. Accordingly, the Court concluded that it\ncould not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Blunts’\nremaining claims, which were based on state law. Id. at 603.\n\n\n                                25\n\fthat there was not a common nucleus of operative fact between\nher claims and those of the other students.23 J.A. vol. 3, at 597.\n\n\n       On December 22, 2008, the remaining plaintiffs moved\nfor class certification. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 64. After\nthe parties briefed the issues, the District Court held a hearing\non the motion on July 21, 2009. Id., Doc. No. 122.24 By an\norder of August 19, 2009, (the “August 19, 2009 Order”), the\nCourt denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification\n(Appellants’ No. 11-4200 br. at 39),25 again dismissed the\n\n23\n  The Blunts have not appealed from the District Court’s ruling\nthat it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their state law\nclaims.\n24\n   The District Court scheduled oral argument on the class\ncertification issue for June 26, 2009, but we are uncertain\nwhether the Court held an argument on that day in addition to\nthe July 21, 2009 argument, or whether argument took place on\nthe second date because the original argument had been\npostponed. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 118.\n25\n   In doing so, the District Court explained that, among other\nrationales for this denial, it had determined that the factual\ncircumstances of potential class members were too disparate to make\nfinal injunctive or declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a\nwhole. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.60. The Court noted that the disparate\nfactual circumstances of individual students also likely would\noverwhelm the litigation:\n\n       Analysis of whether an African American student with a\n\n                                26\n\fclaims brought by the CBP and the NAACP for lack of standing,\nand found that a prior court-entered settlement agreement\nreached in Gaskin v. Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2498158\"><a href=\"/opinion/2498158/gaskin-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D.\nPa. 2005), barred all claims against the PDE, which it therefore\ndismissed from the case. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.46-42.69.\n\n        In concluding that CBP lacked standing, the District\nCourt found that it did not have a personal stake in the outcome\nof the litigation, and did not suffer an injury giving it standing.\nRather, “[i]ts injuries [we]re more akin to an abstract,\nideological interest in the litigation as opposed to the necessary\n‘personal stake in the outcome’ of the controversy necessary to\nconfer standing.” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.52. In addition, the Court\nreasoned that CBP did not have standing to bring suit on behalf\nof its members because, according to CBP’s bylaws, it did not\nhave any members. J.A. vol. 1, at 42.53-54; August 19, 2009\nOrder at 9 (“The corporation’s bylaws specifically state ‘the\nCorporation shall have no members.’ In light of this express\nstatement in a formal document governing the conduct of the\n\n\n        disability was deprived of an appropriate education will be\n        highly individualized and dependent upon that particular\n        student’s needs, capabilities, and the IEP in place for that\n        child. These individual determinations, which must be made\n        to determine whether a particular student falls within the class\n        definition and whether such student has a cause of action,\n        weigh against certifying this class.\n\nJ.A. vol. 1, at 42.61.\n\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\fcorporation, we find that it does not have standing to bring suit\non behalf of its members because it has none.”). J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.54.\n\n        The District Court also dismissed the claims against the\nPDE because the settlement agreement that the parties had\nreached in Gaskin barred this action against the PDE. The\nCourt noted that Gaskin was similar to this action, as 12\nstudents with disabilities and 11 disability advocacy groups\nbrought that case against the PDE, among others, pursuant to the\nIDEA, § 504 of the RA, and Title II of the ADA. The Gaskin\nplaintiffs made similar (although not identical) allegations as\nthose in this case, alleging that the defendants failed to provide\ndisabled students the opportunity to participate in regular\neducation classrooms, provided insufficient supplementary aids\nand services, and generally failed to provide them with a free\nappropriate public education (“FAPE”). J.A. vol. 1, at 42.63,\n42.67. Though the Court acknowledged that the Gaskin\ncomplaint had not alleged racial discrimination as “the basis for\nthe improper treatment of those with learning disabilities,” the\nCourt nonetheless held that the causes of action in Gaskin and\nhere arose from the same “common nucleus of operative facts.”\nThe Court therefore concluded that the release included in the\nGaskin settlement agreement, which by its terms was effective\nfor five years from September 19, 2005, to September 19, 2010,\nbarred the claims in this case because the plaintiffs brought this\naction and individual plaintiffs in this action were evaluated and\nidentified as learning disabled during this period. J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.67, 42.68; Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 19:9-22.\nSignificantly, the class of plaintiffs in the Gaskin litigation was\nvery broad and included “all present and future school age\n\n                                28\n\fstudents with disabilities       in   the   Commonwealth       of\nPennsylvania.”26\n\n       On April 5, 2011, the District Court denied a motion by\nLMSD to amend its answer to the plaintiffs’ TAC to include an\nadditional defense based on releases that certain plaintiffs\nsigned after the LMSD filed its answer in this case because the\nCourt believed that the LMSD unreasonably had delayed\nmaking the motion. J.A. vol. 1, at 46-47. LMSD has filed a\ncross-appeal from the order but, as will be seen, this appeal is\nmoot and thus we do not address it.\n\n      The LMSD filed a motion for summary judgment on July\n15, 2011, (No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 159), and it is that\nmotion that has led to the order at the heart of this appeal. The\n26\n   We queried the attorneys for appellees at oral argument as to\nwhether the Gaskin settlement should apply given that the\nplaintiffs in Gaskin brought their claims under the IDEA, ADA\nand RA, and the appellants other than the Blunts were\nadvancing only § 1983 and Title VI claims. Tr. Oral Arg. June\n13, 2013, at 27. However, as noted above, we recently\nindicated in a related case, S.H. v. Lower Merion School\nDistrict, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2013), that litigants who\nincorrectly were identified as disabled might be able to bring\nsuit under the ADA and RA, but cannot bring suit under the\nIDEA, as that statute extends only to disabled individuals, not to\nindividuals who incorrectly were identified as disabled. Id. at\n257-58. But regardless of what claims could have been brought\nagainst the PDE, as we explain below the Gaskin settlement bars\nthe claims in this case.\n\n\n                               29\n\fparties filed numerous documents in support of and in\nopposition to the motion for summary judgment. On October 4,\n2011, the District Court held a hearing on the motion, at which\ntime the Court afforded all parties the opportunity to present\ntheir arguments. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. Nos. 174, 183.\n\n        On October 20, 2011, the District Court made three\ndocket entries, two of which were orders and a third which is\nthe memorandum explaining the basis for those orders\n(collectively, the “October 20, 2011 Memorandum and\nJudgment Order”). No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. Nos. 180-82. In the\nOctober 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order, the Court\ndenied plaintiffs’ motion to partially exclude and/or limit the\nreport and testimony of Daniel J. Reschly, Ph.D., a witness for\nthe LMSD, as moot. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 181. The\nCourt’s principal order granted summary judgment to the LMSD\nagainst all remaining plaintiffs in the action. J.A. vol. 1, at 1-39;\nalso available at No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 182. The Court\nheld that the plaintiffs had failed to put forth any evidence from\nwhich a reasonable inference could be drawn that the LMSD\nintentionally segregated the students on the basis of race into\ninferior educational programs in violation of Title VI. J.A. vol.\n1, at 30-32. The Court also held that plaintiffs had failed to\nestablish a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 case for violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as they had not\nestablished that the LMSD had engaged in purposeful\ndiscrimination and had not been deliberately indifferent to\nplaintiffs’ rights. J.A. vol. 1, at 33-34.\n\n       The District Court noted in particular that plaintiffs were\nrequired to “raise at least some reasonable inference that they\n\n\n                                 30\n\fwere placed into classes and offered services by the [LMSD]\ndue to intentional discrimination based on their race and not\nsimply due to errors in evaluation.” The Court concluded that\nplaintiffs had failed to support this inference with sufficient\nevidence, and had not put forth more than a scintilla of evidence\nthat the LMSD had acted with a racially discriminatory purpose\nin identifying them as disabled and placing them in special\neducation courses (regardless of whether this identification was\ncorrect or not). They also failed to identify an official policy or\ncustom that was deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs’ rights.\nJ.A. vol. 1, at 32-36;27 also available at No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc.\nNo. 180.\n\n        On November 18, 2011, the Blunt plaintiffs and the CBP\nfiled a notice of appeal from the District Court’s October 20,\n2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order.

Their notice of appeal specifically cited the District\nCourt’s order of August 19, 2009, in which the Court dismissed\nthe claims against defendant PDE, an order of October 20, 2011,\nentering the summary judgment in favor of LMSD, and an order\nof October 20, 2011, denying as moot plaintiffs’ motion to\npreclude expert testimony.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’\nfederal law claims pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(A),29 28\nU.S.C. § 1331, and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). In addition, the\nplaintiffs claimed that the Court had supplemental jurisdiction\nover their state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. We,\nhowever, do not determine whether the District Court had\njurisdiction over the state law claims because no party contends\nthat the Court erred in not exercising jurisdiction over those\nclaims. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n\n\n                     IV.

Lauren W., 480\nF.3d at 266. However, we do not make such an analysis here, as\nthe issue before us with respect to the Blunts, the only\nappellants who exhausted their administrative remedies, is\nwhether the District Court correctly dismissed their case on the\ngrounds that they brought it beyond the period allowed by the\nstatute of limitations. The resolution of that issue would not be\naided by administrative expertise.\n\n\n\n           V. ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL\n\n       Though the District Court made many rulings, the\nappellants have appealed only from some of them. Accordingly,\nwe are able to summarize the issues on this appeal as follows:\n\n       1. Did the District Court correctly dismiss the action\nagainst the PDE on the basis of res judicata (claim preclusion)?\n\n\n                               37\n\f       2. Did the District Court correctly conclude that CBP did\nnot have standing as a plaintiff in this action?\n\n        3. Does the IDEA’s 90-day statute of limitations, in\nwhich a party adversely affected by an administrative\ndetermination of an IDEA claim may bring a state or federal\nsuit, enacted on December 3, 2004, and effective July 1, 2005,\napply to bar the Blunts’ federal action, given that they first\nbegan the administrative judicial process on April 8, 2005, when\nthe IDEA’s statute of limitations for bringing a claim in state or\nfederal court after receiving an adverse administrative\ndetermination was two years, and they received their final\nadverse administrative disposition on August 31, 2005, almost\ntwo months after the new 90-day statute of limitations came into\neffect, and almost nine months after Congress enacted it?33\n\n       4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in how it\n33\n  We note that although the statute of limitations issue was not\ndiscussed at oral argument, the Blunts’ brief raises a challenge\nto the District Court’s ruling on the issue as a prime point of\nargument. Appellants’ br. No. 11-4201 at 31-37. Presumably,\nhowever, in the case of student appellants who no longer are\nclaiming to be disabled, but rather are claiming to have been\nmisidentified as disabled, a statute of limitations issue would be\ninapplicable. However, as far as we can tell from the record, at\nleast one or two of the student plaintiffs do not challenge their\nidentification as disabled, and counsel for the Blunts has not\nwithdrawn the argument regarding the statute of limitations\nwhich thus has been preserved on appeal. Therefore, we\naddress the statute of limitations issue.\n\n\n                               38\n\ftreated certain evidence that plaintiffs offered by not giving it\ngreater weight and not considering the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiffs when the Court considered and\ngranted the motion for summary judgment made by the LMSD\nand, on the other hand, in how it treated certain evidence that\nLMSD offered for consideration on that motion?\n\n       5. Did plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VI and § 1983 such that\nsummary judgment was inappropriate?34\n\n\n\n               VI. SUMMARY OF THE LAW\n\n       A. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n       Congress enacted the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.,\nwith the goal of “improving educational results for children with\ndisabilities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(1). The congressional\nfindings and purposes section of the IDEA is quite broad and\nsets forth in great detail Congress’ intention in adopting the\nIDEA.\n\n       Each public school district in a state that accepts federal\n\n34\n   LMSD argues that the District Court improperly denied its\nmotion to amend its answer. We, however, do not reach that\nissue because our determination that the Court properly granted\nsummary judgment in its favor and our affirmance of the other\norders on appeal are dispositive of the issue.\n\n\n                               39\n\ffunds under IDEA35 has a continuing obligation, called the\n“child find” requirement, to identify and evaluate all students\nreasonably believed to have a disability, and each state receiving\nfunds must establish procedures to effectuate this requirement.\nRidley Sch.

We have explained the\nbalance between reasonable goals for the IEP and a parent’s\nfondest hopes for the parent’s child as follows:\n\n       Under the IDEA, school districts must work with parents\n       to design an IEP, which is a program of individualized\n       instruction for each special education student. ‘Each IEP\n       must include an assessment of the child’s current\n       educational performance, must articulate measurable\n       educational goals, and must specify the nature of the\n       special services that the school will provide.’ Although\n       the IEP must provide the student with a ‘basic floor of\n\n                               41\n\f       opportunity,’ it does not have to provide ‘the optimal\n       level of services,’ or incorporate every program\n       requested by the child’s parents. . . . [T]he IDEA\n       guarantees to a disabled child ‘an education that is\n       appropriate, not one that provides everything that might\n       be thought desirable by loving parents’ . . . . ‘[A]t a\n       minimum, the IEP must be reasonably calculated to\n       enable the child to receive meaningful educational\n       benefits in light of the student’s intellectual potential,’\n       and ‘individual abilities.’\n\nRidley, 680 F.3d at 276 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Congress amended the IDEA through the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Improvement Act of 2004 to require that an\nIEP include “a statement of the special education and related\nservices and supplementary aids and services, based on peer-\nreviewed research to the extent practicable, to be provided to the\nchild.” Ridley, 680 F.3d at 276 (emphasis in original) (quoting\nand citing 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)). Because neither\nthe text of the IDEA nor the regulations promulgated under it\nprovided guidance regarding the peer-review research provision,\nwe looked to the agency’s interpretation of its own regulations\nfor guidance, and determined (1) that although schools should\nstrive to base a student’s IEP on peer-reviewed research to the\nmaximum extent possible, the student’s IEP team must be\nallowed to be flexible in devising an appropriate program for\nany particular student in light of the available research; and (2)\ncourts must accord significant deference to the choices made by\nschool officials as to what constitutes an appropriate program\n\n\n\n                               42\n\ffor each student.37 Ridley, 680 F.3d at 277 (citing 71 Fed.

Rather, the peer-review specially designed instruction\nin an IEP must be ‘reasonably calculated to enable the child to\nreceive meaningful educational benefits in light of the student’s\nintellectual potential.’” Ridley, 680 F.3d at 277 (citing\nChambers v.

While we recognized that “there may be\ncases in which the specially designed instruction proposed by a\nschool district is so at odds with current research that it\nconstitutes a denial of a FAPE,” and that “if it is practicable for\na school district to implement a program based upon peer-\nreviewed research, and the school fails to do so, that will weigh\nheavily against a finding that the school provided a FAPE,”\nnonetheless we declined to set a bright-line rule as to what\nconstitutes an adequately peer-reviewed special education\nprogram, and emphasized that the appropriateness of an IEP\nmust be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account\nthe available research. Id. at 279.\n\n\n                                43\n\f‘impartial due process hearing,’” as may a school district if it\nwants to change an existing IEP or seeks an evaluation without\nthe parents’ consent.

See Schaffer,\n546 U.S. at 62, 126 S.Ct. at 537. Similarly, the party judicially\nchallenging an administrative decision bears the burden of\npersuasion with respect to the finding for each claim challenged.\n Ridley, 680 F.3d at 270.\n\n        On December 3, 2004, Congress revised the IDEA with\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act of 2004,\nwhich included a two-year statute of limitations governing the\ntime during which an aggrieved party may file a request for an\nadministrative due process hearing under the IDEA. P.L. 108-\n446, 118 Stat. 2647 (2004); 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(c). The two-\nyear period runs from the date that the parent knew or should\nhave known about the alleged action that forms the basis for the\ncomplaint. The same two-year statute of limitations for bringing\nadministrative claims also applies to other legal claims premised\non the IDEA, such as claims under § 504 of the RA, or claims\n“invoking Child Find and FAPE duties.” D.K., 696 F.3d at 244\n(quoting P.P. ex. rel. Michael P., 585 F.3d at 734). In the same\nlegislation, Congress shortened the statute of limitations to 90\ndays for a party dissatisfied with the result of the administrative\nproceedings to bring a federal or state judicial action to\nchallenge that result. Though Congress mandated that these\nnew statutes of limitations were to be retroactive, it delayed\ntheir effective dates until July 1, 2005.\n\n\n                                44\n\f        In 2010, we determined that the seven-month “grace\nperiod” between the enactment of the two-year statute of\nlimitations and its effective date provided litigants with\nreasonable notice and opportunity to bring claims, so that it was\nnot unfair to impose the new statute of limitations and thus the\nperiod that the limitations period allowed was not impermissibly\nshort.

In the context of a retrospective\n        statute of limitations, a reasonable grace period provides\n        an adequate guarantee of fairness.

ANALYSIS\n\n        Now that we have set forth the procedural history, facts,\nand applicable law in this case we directly address the issues\nraised in this appeal. We first will discuss whether the District\nCourt correctly determined that the Gaskin settlement and final\nadjudication barred the claims against the PDE. Then we will\ndiscuss whether CBP has standing as a litigant in this case. Our\nthird focus will be on the issue of whether the IDEA’s 90-day\nstatute of limitations bars the Blunt plaintiffs’ claims. Finally,\nwe will discuss whether any of the plaintiffs still in the action\nwhen the LMSD moved for summary judgment established a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination under Title VI and/or\n\n                               70\n\fpresented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the LMSD\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 so that the District\nCourt erroneously entered its October 20, 2011 Memorandum\nand Judgment Order granting summary judgment in favor of the\nLMSD.48 As part of this last issue, we will review for abuse of\ndiscretion the District Court’s determinations in using the\nevidence submitted on the motion for summary judgment.\n\n          A. The Effect of the Gaskin Settlement on the\n          Claims Against the PDE\n\n        We conclude that the District Court correctly held that\nthe Gaskin settlement barred the plaintiffs’ claims against the\nPDE. Although the Gaskin plaintiffs were basing their claims\nagainst the PDE on its alleged supervisory failure and did not\nassert that it engaged in racial discrimination, the Gaskin class\nconsisted of “all school-age students with disabilities in\nPennsylvania who have been denied a free appropriate education\nin regular classrooms with individualized supportive services,\nindividualized instruction, and accommodations they need to\nsucceed in the regular education classroom.” J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.64. The allegations against PDE in this case are strikingly\nsimilar to those made against it in Gaskin. As the District Court\n\n48\n  Although we do not reach this issue with respect to the Blunts\n(as the brief in No. 11-4201 filed on their behalf did not and\ncould not challenge the summary judgment), it is difficult to see\nhow we would have come to a different result if we had done so.\n\n\n\n\n                               71\n\fsummarized:\n\n       As in Gaskin, the plaintiffs here claim that the PDE\n       violated the IDEA by failing to identify children with\n       disabilities and provide needed special education and\n       related services and by failing to provide the plaintiffs\n       and members of the putative class a free, appropriate\n       public education. As in Gaskin, plaintiffs here bring a\n       claim against the PDE under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\n       Act.\n\nJ.A. vol. 1, at 42.67.\n\n        We conclude that the claims plaintiffs asserted against\nthe PDE in this case overlap with the claims made in Gaskin.\nThough plaintiffs here advance theories of racial motivation not\nraised in Gaskin, the claims here arise from a “common nucleus\nof operative facts” when compared to the claims in Gaskin:\nnamely LMSD’s failure to provide a FAPE to students by\nmishandling identification and/or testing of students for learning\ndisabilities which resulted in incorrect placements. Thus, the\nrelease entered into in Gaskin bars the claims here against the\nPDE because the Gaskin release covered claims arising between\n2005 and 2010 and included all present and future students with\ndisabilities within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Indeed,\nappellants acknowledge that most, though not all, of the plaintiff\nstudents in this case were evaluated individually and their IEPs\nformulated before the Gaskin settlement. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 19:9-22.\n\n       As explained above, we apply res judicata and claim\npreclusion as a consequence of settlement agreements because\n\n                               72\n\fby doing so we encourage settlements and “serve[ ] the\nimportant policy interest of judicial economy by permitting\nparties to enter into comprehensive settlements that ‘prevent\nrelitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action.’”\nPrudential, 261 F.3d at 366. We see no reason to depart from\nthat policy in this case.\n\n        In considering the res judicata issue we recognize that,\nalthough the Gaskin release was broad,49 there is no suggestion\nin the record that the attorneys who represented the parties in\nGaskin did not negotiate the settlement at arms’ length.\nMoreover, the district court in Gaskin reviewed and accepted the\nsettlement; and the settlement led the parties to forego additional\nlitigation in which they could have advanced their positions with\nthe hope of obtaining what they perceived would be a more\nfavorable outcome than the settlement agreement provided them.\n We agree with the PDE that the claims against it in this case,\nlike those in Gaskin, deal with its alleged failure to monitor\nspecial education programs carried out by school districts in\nPennsylvania, including the procedures regarding testing of\nstudents for special education services and other aspects of the\nprovision of special education services to students entitled to\nthem, and that the settlement covered the period from 2005-\n2010. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 26:12-25.\n\n       We recognize that appellants argue that the District Court\nhere erred in its interpretation of the parties’ intent in entering\ninto the Gaskin settlement agreement. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 21-23. There can be no doubt that, as other courts have\n49\n     See Tr. Oral Arg.

Overall, we are\nsatisfied from the terms of the Gaskin settlement that it included\nthe claims made against the PDE here, and thus the settlement\nbarred them.51\n\n\n\n\n51\n  We have not overlooked appellants’ argument that the Gaskin\nsettlement could not bar claims that arose after its effective date.\n Rather, we reject that argument because the settlement included\nclaims of “future” students and therefore necessarily it included\nthe claims that arose after its effective date.\n\n\n\n\n                                75\n\f           B. Whether CBP Has Standing in this Suit52\n\n\n52\n   As a matter of convenience this subsection largely is written\nas though for the Court, but in fact this section in its entirety\nrepresents only the views of Judge Greenberg, as Chief Judge\nMcKee and Judge Ambro agree with aspects of the section but,\nas they explain in their separate opinions, not its conclusion that\nCBP does not have standing. Although Judge Ambro, in his\nconcurring opinion, concludes that “CBP has standing to sue on\nits own behalf,” he also observes that “CBP has not explained\nhow, were it permitted to continue as a plaintiff in the case, it\ncould prevail where the individual Plaintiffs have failed.” Chief\nJudge McKee writes that “CBP’s likelihood of success on the\nmerits has no bearing on its standing.” Judge Ambro, however,\ndid not make his observation to support Judge Greenberg’s\nconclusion that CBP does not have standing. Rather, Judge\nAmbro’s point is that, even if CBP has standing, it could not\nsave its case as it could not survive LMSD’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Judge Greenberg agrees that, even if CBP\nhad standing, it would lose on the merits. See infra note 62.\n\n       We note that Chief Judge McKee sets forth that CBP was\ndismissed at an “early stage” of the litigation and did not have\nthe opportunity to engage in discovery. But as we explain\nbelow, the District Court considered the standing issue twice,\nonce in proceedings leading to the February 15, 2008 Order\ndismissing CBP for lack of standing, and again in proceedings\nleading to the August 19, 2009 Order again dismissing CBP for\nlack of standing, and in entering the second order the Court\nconsidered testimony. See infra note 57. Indeed, there was a\n\n                                76\n\f        The District Court dismissed CBP as a plaintiff on its\nown behalf in its February 15, 2008 Order because the Court\nconcluded that CBP had failed to “allege any injury whatsoever”\nto itself beyond advancing evidence that at best insufficiently\ncould support an inference that “the defendants’ conduct may\nhave caused [CBP] . . . to ‘suffer a setback to the\norganization[’s] abstract social interests.’” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.33.\n The Court also determined in its February 15, 2008 Order that\nCBP had not met the three-part test that Hunt v. Washington\nState Apple Advertising Commission indicated needed to be met\nfor an organization to sue on behalf of its members. The CBP\nfailed in this respect because it did not “provid[e] the court with\nthe identity of any member or alleged in the Amended\nComplaint that any of [its] members has suffered an injury[, and\n\ngreat deal of discovery in this case after the Court originally\ndismissed CBP as a party on February 15, 2008, and both this\nopinion and Chief Judge McKee’s opinion refer to this\ndiscovery.\n\n        Judge Ambro and Judge Greenberg see no reason why\nCBP’s participation in the discovery process would have made\nany difference in the outcome of this litigation by somehow\nhaving enabled it to survive the motion for summary judgment if\nit had been directed against it. In this regard, they point out that\nboth groups of plaintiffs had the goal of establishing that LMSD\nhad been violating anti-discrimination and anti-segregation laws\nand regulations and so would have had the same objective in the\ndiscovery process.\n\n\n\n\n                                77\n\fthat w]ithout that information, the court ha[d] no basis to\nconclude that the organization[] ha[s] standing to bring claims\non behalf of [its] members.” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.33-42.34.\nThough CBP’s lack of standing may make no difference with\nrespect to its claims against the PDE inasmuch as the Gaskin\nsettlement may have foreclosed those claims, its claim to have\nstanding raises an issue that must be addressed, for it continues\nto assert claims against the LMSD.53\n\n        CBP has not demonstrated that it suffered an injury to\nitself conferring standing, and, even if its claim is true that it\nhas members notwithstanding its bylaws, CBP does not have\nstanding to sue on their behalf. CBP has a stated purpose to\npromote “equity and excellence in the response of school\ndistricts to the needs of diverse student populations; to address\nissues related to education for populations identified as minority\nand/or African American; and to identify, monitor, and inform\nparents about educational issues impacting disadvantaged\nstudents, their families and the community at large.” J.A. vol. 1,\nat 42.50.\n\n        In its complaint, CBP identified itself as having been\n“operating as an organization in the LMSD for about 13 years,”\nand as “a non-profit Pennsylvania corporation whose purpose is,\ninter alia, to promote equity and excellence in the response of\nschool districts to the needs of diverse student populations; to\n\n53\n  “May have” is used because CBP was not a member of the\nplaintiff class in Gaskin though it might be so regarded to the\nextent that it asserts it has representational standing. This point\nneed not be explored further.\n\n\n                                78\n\faddress issues related to education for populations identified as\nminority and/or African American; and to identify, monitor, and\ninform parents about educational issues impacting\ndisadvantaged students, their families and the community at\nlarge.” No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 1, pp. 23-24; J.A. vol. 2, at\n509. CBP claimed to bring the action “on its behalf and on\nbehalf of its members.” Id. at 25. CBP identified its members\ngenerally as follows: “[t]he members of the organization are\nresidents of the Lower Merion School District and current and\nformer parents or students of the District.” Id. at 510. The\nDistrict Court noted that, notwithstanding these allegations,\nCBP supplied documents that stated that it had no members.\nSee August 19, 2009 Order at 5, No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No.\n123 (“The organization’s bylaws specifically state ‘[t]he\nCorporation shall have no members.’”). Nevertheless, CBP’s\nprohibition in its bylaws against having members does not\nnecessarily mean that it could not have standing as a plaintiff on\nbehalf of its members. If such a determination were predicated\nsolely on the basis of the bylaws, it would advance the strictly\nformalistic approach that we have rejected in other cases. See\nPublic Interest Research Grp., 123 F.3d at 119. Nonetheless,\nthe bylaws do provide context to the overall analysis,\nparticularly in considering whether CBP has attempted to create\nstanding for itself by changing its structure and membership and\nby its expenditure of resources in response to the District\nCourt’s observations concerning its standing.\n\n      In the TAC, the last revised complaint in this case, CBP\ndid not change its statement of purpose quoted above. It,\nhowever, did identify 11 of its members by name, five of whom\nare individually named plaintiffs in this case, and it also\n\n                               79\n\fidentified itself as “support[ing]” several more class members\nand individually named plaintiffs in this case at school-related\nmeetings and court proceedings. TAC, No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc.\nNo. 55, pp. 25-26. CBP also went to great pains to explain the\nrise in its expenditures “over the five years” in relation to this\ncase because, as discussed above, the expenditure of funds by an\norganization on behalf of a cause, though not determinative, is\none factor that may be considered in resolving a standing issue.\nThe CBP’s alleged expenditures on behalf of the interests\nembodied in this case included:\n\n           Use of its resources to ‘host educational\n            consultants and experts’ with the purpose of\n            providing information to the Plaintiffs, class\n            members, community and LMSD;\n           A ‘sharp’ rise in expenditures over the last five\n            years due to its efforts to ‘protect its members\n            from the adverse impact’ of ‘the inferior quality\n            of LMSD’s dual system of education’;\n           Expenditure of resources as a result of its\n            attending meetings related to IEPs, Section 504\n            and ‘disciplinary meetings, court hearings and\n            parent-teacher conferences with and/or on behalf\n            of’ various plaintiffs, CBP members and class\n            members;\n           Its efforts in facilitating a ‘Conciliation\n            Agreement between LMSD and the Pennsylvania\n            Human Relations Commission in which the\n            District promised, inter alia, to eradicate the\n            disproportionate suspension of African American\n            students as compared to White students’;\n\n                               80\n\f           Production of a 45-minute video ‘highlighting the\n            issue of racial inequality’;\n           Making the public aware of ‘racial graffiti and\n            symbols’ which ‘were promulgated at both LMSD\n            high school and middle school buildings’;54\n           Publication of a community newsletter and ‘News\n            Notes . . . to disseminate the compilations of data\n            on’ alleged racial disparities in application of\n            disciplinary measures, segregation by race and\n            ‘under achievement of African American students\n            in the [Lower Merion] District’;\n           The ‘organization’ of educational, career,\n            standardized test, financial aid, and college\n            preparatory seminars.\n\nTAC at 25-26; J.A. vol. 9, at 3871-72.\n\n       Even if all of these expenditures were legitimate, CBP\nhas not established organizational standing. An organization\nmay establish a “concrete and demonstrable injury” sufficient to\nconfer standing if a defendant’s actions “perceptibly impair” the\norganization’s ability to provide services.

In Havens, HOME’s purpose was to\npromote equality in the Richmond area overall and its interests\nthus went far beyond monitoring the specific actions at issue in\nthe Havens case. By contrast, the CBP is targeted only at\nLMSD, so its very purpose was to expend resources to educate\nthe public regarding the LMSD’s behavior. J.A. vol. 2, at 510\n(defining CBP’s membership as residents of LMSD and LMSD\nparents and students). Because it is targeted at LMSD, all of\nCBP’s resources would necessarily have been spent on LMSD-\nrelated projects. CBP has failed to show why this particular\nlitigation has frustrated its mission, or caused a “concrete and\ndemonstrable” injury to its activities. It appears that the alleged\nadditional expenditures were consistent with CBP’s typical\nactivities, and it is thus unclear the effect, if any, that this\nlitigation had on their expenditures.

CBP simply has not established that the\nLMSD’s actions have frustrated its efforts to fulfill its mission.\n\n\n\n\n56\n   We emphasize that much of what we write with respect to\nstanding reflects the views only of Judge Greenberg.\n\n\n                                83\n\fThus, it has not established standing to sue on its own behalf.57\n\n       CBP also has not established that it has standing to sue\non behalf of its members, if it has any. Hunt v. Washington\nState Apple Advertising Commission is a useful starting point in\nthe consideration of this issue because the Supreme Court\ndiscussed indicia of membership as a means of establishing that\n\n57\n   As we state above, see supra note 52, the District Court\nconsidered the standing issue twice, once in proceedings leading\nto the February 15, 2008 Order dismissing CBP for lack of\nstanding, and again in proceedings leading to the August 19,\n2009 Order again dismissing CBP for lack of standing. This\nlatter consideration included testimony. The dissent parses this\ntestimony in detail, and Judge Greenberg likewise considers it in\nhis analysis. However, a plaintiff may not simply make\nrepeated amendments to a complaint to “fix” the standing issue.\n In this regard, the court’s reasoning in La Asociacion de\nTrabajadores is instructive: “[A plaintiff] may not effectively\namend its [c]omplaint by raising a new theory of standing in its\nresponse to a motion for summary judgment. ‘Simply put,\nsummary judgment is not a procedural second chance to flesh\nout inadequate pleadings.’” 624 F.3d at 1089 (internal citations\nomitted) (quoting Wasco Prods., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793104\"><a href=\"/opinion/793104/wasco-products-inc-v-southwall-technologies-inc-bostik-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 992 (9th Cir. 2006)). This is not to say that a\nplaintiff never can cure a pleading with respect to a standing\nissue in response to a motion for summary judgment challenging\nits standing. Rather, the court of appeals’ comments are\nappropriate in the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n\n                               84\n\fan organization has members. 432 U.S. at 344, 97 S.Ct. at\n2442.\n\n        In Hunt, the Supreme Court determined that a\ncommission created by the State of Washington to represent\nand promote the advertising interests of that State’s apple\ngrowers, whose collective efforts constituted “a multimillion\ndollar enterprise which plays a significant role in Washington’s\neconomy,” had standing to challenge a North Carolina statute\nprohibiting the display of apple grading codes on boxes of\napples shipped to North Carolina. Id. at 336, 97 S.Ct. at 2438.\nThe Washington State apple grading system had been in place\nfor over 60 years, and the stamp reflecting the apple grading was\na selling point for Washington State apples because of the good\nreputation of that State’s apple growing regulations. But due to\nthe structure of the industry, it would have been difficult to pack\nsome apples in unstamped boxes and ensure that they were sent\nto North Carolina, while ensuring that stamped boxes were\nseparated and not shipped to North Carolina. Id. at 337, 97\nS.Ct. at 2438-39. The Supreme Court found that in the\ncircumstances of that case58 the Washington State Apple\nAdvertising Commission had standing to bring the action\nchallenging the North Carolina statute. Id. at 344-45, 97 S.Ct. at\n\n58\n   “Under the circumstances presented here, it would exalt form\nover substance to differentiate between the Washington\nCommission [as a government-mandated organization] and a\ntraditional trade association representing individual growers and\ndealers who collectively form its constituency.” Hunt, 432 U.S.\nat 345, 97 S.Ct. at 2442 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                85\n\f2442. The Court explained that “while the apple growers and\ndealers are not ‘members’ of the Commission in the traditional\ntrade association sense,” because their membership was not\nvoluntary, but rather was required by statute, “they possess[ed]\nall of the indicia of membership in an organization.” Id. at 344,\n97 S.Ct. at 2442.\n\n       In making this determination, the Court noted that only\nWashington State apple growers and dealers could elect the\nmembers of the Commission, and that the growers and dealers\nalone financed its activities, including litigation costs, through\nmandatory assessments levied on them. Id. at 344-45, 97 S.Ct.\nat 2442. The Court found that “[i]n a very real sense, therefore,\nthe Commission represents the State’s growers and dealers and\nprovides the means by which they express their collective views\nand protect their collective interests.” Id. at 345, 97 S.Ct. at\n2442. The Court reasoned that the statutorily-mandated\nparticipation of apple growers and dealers through assessments\ndid not bar the Commission from having standing, analogizing\nthat\n\n       [m]embership in a union, or its equivalent, is often\n       required. Likewise, membership in a bar association,\n       which may also be an agency of the State, is often a\n       prerequisite to the practice of law. Yet in neither\n       instance would it be reasonable to suggest that such an\n       organization lacked standing to assert the claims of its\n       constituents.\n\nId., 97 S.Ct. at 2442.\n\n       Further, the Court noted that the Commission had a\n\n                               86\n\fstrong direct interest in the litigation, because its existence\ndepended on the economic health of the Washington State\napple-growing industry. Moreover, assessments based on the\nvolume of apples grown and packaged provided the\nCommission’s funding and the North Carolina regulation was\nexpected to have a great economic impact on the Washington\nState apple industry. Id., 97 S.Ct. at 2442.\n\n        Though appellants rely heavily on Hunt, Judge\nGreenberg believes that it clearly is distinguishable. CBP is not\nfunded through mandatory assessments of African American\nstudents or their parents residing in the LMSD. Further, CBP’s\nfunding is not tied directly to a clear economic interest which\nwill be affected by the outcome of this litigation. The analogy\nof a traditional trade organization discussed in Hunt is simply\nnot relevant to the CBP’s position in this case. Moreover, in an\nentirely different setting, the Court based its decision in Hunt on\nthe circumstances of that case, including an analysis of how the\nCommission functioned as an organization.59\n\n\n59\n   In support of his contention that CBP has standing, Chief\nJudge McKee indicates that if CBP “can establish both the\ndiscriminatory practices and resultant harm alleged, any\ninjunctive or declaratory relief would surely inure to the benefit\nof African American students and parents in the school district.\nThese students and parents are no more required have to be a\nparty to this suit in order to benefit from the requested relief\nthan the constituents in Hunt were required to be parties to\nbenefit receive the benefits there.” The problem with this\nstatement is that, though it indicates that non-parties may benefit\n\n                                87\n\f         Although appellants amended their complaint after the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of the CBP to name several alleged\nindividual CBP members as plaintiffs, CBP’s organizational\ndocuments state that it does not have members. Moreover, even\nthough appellants also added statements to the complaint\nasserting that the CBP was making expenditures related to this\nsuit after the District Court noted the lack of economic impact of\nthe litigation on CBP, this amendment does not supply the basis\nfor standing. It is clear that a nonprofit entity cannot create\nstanding in a lawsuit in which it has no direct economic interest\nby having its representatives attend meetings regarding the issue\nthat the entity intends to raise in the suit, or by making\nexpenditures to “educate” the public on what it regards as the\nfactual or legal basis for its agenda.

It also\n       contradicts the prudential concern behind the\n       standing doctrine that courts not become vehicles\n       for the advancement of ideological and academic\n       agendas.\n\n       In addition to not overcoming the foregoing problems\nwith respect to its standing, CBP does not satisfy the third\nrequirement for an organization to have standing to sue on\nbehalf of its members, namely that neither the claim the\norganization is asserting nor “the relief requested requires the\nparticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Hunt, 432\nU.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441. Even if the District Court’s\nanalysis regarding CBP’s lack of members and its attenuated\nclaims of injury did not demonstrate that CBP did not have\nstanding, after considering this third criterion it is clear that the\nDistrict Court reached the correct result. It is an accepted\nprinciple that “[b]ecause claims for monetary relief usually\n\n                                 90\n\frequire individual participation, courts have held associations\ncannot generally raise these claims on behalf of their members.”\n Pennsylvania Psychiatric Soc’y v.

J.A. 533-34.\n As we discussed below, because the individual plaintiffs are\nparties to the suit, prudential concerns restrict the conferring of\nrepresentational standing on the CBP because the individuals\naffected are capable of litigating their rights on their own behalf.\n Moreover, in Pennsylvania Psychiatric Society, the distinction\nbetween compensatory and injunctive relief was justified by the\nneed for assurance that “the the remedy, if granted, will inure to\nthe benefit of those members of the association actually\ninjured.” 280 F.3d at 284 (quoting Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97\nS.Ct. at 2441). Although the relief would benefit CBP’s\nmembers, the members actually injured are already parties to\nthis suit. It is thus unnecessary for the CBP to have standing to\nvindicate their rights.\n\n\n                                91\n\fLMSD’s incorrect analysis that they were learning disabled.\nAlthough a determination of whether this case should be\ncertified as a class action is no longer an issue in this case, the\nDistrict Court’s explanation of the highly individualized nature\nof these claims is instructive on this last point. It should be\nreadily apparent to anyone reviewing this case that, in view of\nthe complex and varying facts asserted for the individual\nstudents and the myriad legal theories presented in the District\nCourt, the Court was correct in finding that it would have been\ninappropriate to certify this case as a class action. For many of\nthe same reasons, the facts of this case make organizational\nrepresentation of the individual plaintiffs insufficient without\ntheir personal participation in this litigation. After all, the\nparticular aspects of each student’s educational needs, indeed\nthe very individualized character of the application of IEP and\nFAPE to an individual student’s needs, necessarily means that\naddressing the diverse factual assertions in this case would\nrequire individual participation from each student litigant\ninvolved.\n\n       Significantly, the third prong of the Hunt test is\nprudential, not constitutional. See United Food & Commercial\nWorkers Union Local 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118025\"><a href=\"/opinion/118025/food-and-commercial-workers-v-brown-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n555-56, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118025\"><a href=\"/opinion/118025/food-and-commercial-workers-v-brown-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the Supreme Court\nexplained, this inquiry is designed to ensure that sufficient\nreasons exist to justify departing from the “background\npresumption . . . that litigants may not assert the rights of absent\nthird parties,” and thus focuses on “matters of administrative\nconvenience and efficiency.” Id. at 556, 116 S.Ct. at 1536.\nCBP’s claim to standing is grounded on the claims of its\nmembers—individual students—who are also plaintiffs in the\n\n                                92\n\flawsuit.      Unlike other cases conferring standing on\norganizations, the plaintiffs in this case are not absent. See, e.g.,\nid. (organization suing on behalf of its members); Hunt, 432\nU.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441 (same); Pennsylvania Psychiatric\nSoc’y, 280 F.3d at 280 (same).61 The remedies sought here—\ncompensatory and injunctive—will benefit individual plaintiffs\nthat are already parties to the suit. Permitting the CBP to litigate\nthis case on behalf of its members, when those members are\nalready parties to the lawsuit in their own right, does not fulfill\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance to focus on “administrative\nconvenience and efficiency” in determining prudential standing.\n United Food, 517 U.S. at 557, 116 S.Ct. at 1536.\n\n61\n  The fact that the plaintiffs are parties to the suit distinguishes\nthis case from “‘the long line of cases in which organizations\nhave sued to enforce civil rights’” to which Judge McKee’s\ndissent has referred. It is true that, in many circumstances, an\norganizational plaintiff may be the best (and only) mechanism\nby which discrimination against a large group of individuals\nmay be remedied. However, where—as here—individual\nplaintiffs have brought suit on their own behalf, courts are not\njustified in making an exception to the general rule that third\nparties may not assert their rights. Although, in Powell v.\nRidge, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1999), claims for both individual\nand organizational plaintiffs were permitted to proceed, the suit\nchallenged state policy affecting all students in Philadelphia\nschools, a class far larger than the eleven parents who actually\njoined the suit. By contrast, the group at issue here affects a\nmuch smaller set of students who are all capable of joining the\nsuit as individuals or as a class.\n\n                                 93\n\f         As the District Court explained:\n\n         the amount of compensatory education necessary for\n         each named plaintiff and class member would require a\n         highly individualized inquiry into that student’s unique\n         needs, whether those needs were met, the extent to which\n         the School District failed to provide that student with a\n         free, appropriate public education and the proper amount\n         of compensatory education necessary to redress any\n         deficiencies. The individualized analysis of each\n         student’s educational history and needs precludes a\n         finding that a class would be efficiently managed by this\n         court.\n\nAugust 19, 2009 Order at 17, No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 123.\n\n        The District Court’s findings regarding the individualized\nnature of the factual basis for each plaintiff’s claim go directly\nto the third prong for organizational standing, which requires\nthat, for an organization to assert standing on behalf of its\nmembers, their individual participation in the lawsuit must be\nunnecessary. It is very clear that the highly individualized\ncomponents of the plaintiffs’ claims, the complex history of\neach plaintiff’s IEP and evaluations, and the changes in\nunderstanding of his or her disability status, led the Court to\nconclude correctly that the students’ individual participation in\nthis lawsuit was required. Thus, the Court believed that CBP is\nnot an appropriate representational litigant for individual\nstudents and/or their parents.62\n\n\n62\n     Although the District Court’s dismissal of CBP’s claims due\n\n                                94\n\f           C.

We,\nhowever, will not avoid deciding the standing issue on the\nground that it is moot, for the necessity for a party to have\nstanding is jurisdictional and thus a court of appeals always\nmust determine if the district court from which the appellant\ntook the appeal had jurisdiction.\n63\n   As we already have indicated, this new theory rests on an\nevaluation prepared by a psychologist that the plaintiffs engaged\nto evaluate the student plaintiffs.

Id. at 42.23. Both the Blunts and the LMSD filed\nexceptions to the Hearing Officer’s decision with an Appeals\nPanel which issued its ruling on August 31, 2005. Id.\nTherefore, for purposes of calculating the time allowed by the\nstatute of limitations for the Blunts to file their action under the\nIDEA, their cause of action accrued on August 31, 2005.\n\n        The Blunts argue that the 90-day statute of limitations for\nan IDEA claimant adversely affected by an administrative\ndecision to bring suit in state or federal court does not apply to\ntheir case, even though this statute of limitations became\neffective on July 1, 2005, and the decision in their\nadministrative case became final on August 31, 2005. They\nargue that we should reach this result because they filed their\nrequest for a due process hearing on April 8, 2005, before the\nchange in the limitations period. Therefore, the Blunts believe\nthat an earlier version of the IDEA under which their IDEA\nclaims would have been timely should apply in their case. In\ntheir view, to apply the 90-day statute of limitations effective on\nJuly 1, 2005, to their case “would be an impermissible\nretroactive application of IDEA amendments.” J.A. vol. 1, at\n42.20. They assert that their case is unique because there has\nbeen no other case applying the statute of limitations in a\nsituation in which the administrative due process hearing request\nwas made before the 2004 IDEA amendments became effective,\nbut the final administrative decision was rendered after the\namendments had become effective. Thus, they contend that the\n\n                                97\n\f90-day statute of limitations should not bar their IDEA claims.\n\n        We, however, agree with the District Court, which “[was]\nnot persuaded” by their contention because “[t]he date that the\nhearing was requested is irrelevant.” J.A. vol. 1, at 42.23.\nRather, we look at the statute of limitations in effect on the date\nof the final administrative decision, August 31, 2005. Indeed, it\nmight be asked why we even would consider applying any other\nlimitations period as the Blunts could not have brought their\nIDEA action before August 31, 2005. Consequently, when the\nBlunts’ federal cause of action arose, the 90-day statute of\nlimitations was in effect, and when they brought their case in the\nDistrict Court on July 30, 3007, it was untimely. Inasmuch as\nthe law setting forth the limitations period changed on\nDecember 3, 2004, and became effective on July 1, 2005, the\nchange as applied to them was hardly abrupt and it left the\nBlunts with nine months, from December 3, 2004, until August\n31, 2005, to become familiar with the revisions, and an\nadditional 90 days after August 31, 2005, in which to file their\naction.\n\n        The LMSD cites Steven I. for the proposition that the\ntwo-year statute of limitations governing due process hearings is\nretroactive to the extent that it applies to proceedings pending\nwhen it became effective. It further contends that the seven\nmonths between the enactment of this new statute of limitations\nand its effective date gave potential claimants sufficient notice\nso that its retroactive application did not violate due process.\nThe Blunts contend, however, that Steven I. is not applicable\nbecause that case dealt with the two-year statute of limitations\nfor bringing an administrative claim under the IDEA, rather than\n\n\n                                98\n\fthe specific statute of limitations at issue, i.e., 90-day statute of\nlimitations for bringing a state or federal suit after receipt of an\nadverse administrative determination. But the Blunts cannot\nconvincingly explain why an analysis regarding the 90-day\nstatute of limitations, embodied in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)\nand applicable to the filing of a judicial challenge in a state or\nfederal court to an administrative decision, should be different\nfrom an analysis of the validity of the changing of the time\nperiod in which to bring an administrative claim under the\nIDEA, embodied in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(C). In considering\nthis matter we point out that the amendment of the IDEA on\nDecember 3, 2004, which took effect on July 1, 2005, dealt with\nboth limitations periods.\n\n        We find that the reasoning we employed in Steven I. is\napplicable here. In that case we relied on the analysis in\nTexaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. at 532, 102 S.Ct. at 793. In\nTexaco v. Short, the Court spoke to the issue of fairness, which\nbalances the need for a grace period when shortening a\nlimitations period, with the need for injured parties to be vigilant\nin protecting their rights:\n\n               The Court has upheld retroactive\n               adjustments to a limitations period only\n               when the legislature has provided a grace\n               period during which the potential plaintiff\n               could reasonably be expected to learn of\n               the change in the law and then initiate his\n               action. In the context of a retrospective\n               statute of limitations, a reasonable grace\n               period provides an adequate guarantee of\n\n\n                                 99\n\f               fairness. Having suffered the triggering\n               event of an injury, a potential plaintiff is\n               likely to possess a heightened alertness to\n               the possibly changing requirements of the\n               law bearing on his claim. Because redress\n               necessarily depends on recourse to the\n               State’s judicial system, the State is free to\n               condition its intervention on rules of\n               procedure, and further, to impose on the\n               potential plaintiff the obligation to monitor\n               changes in those rules. Plaintiffs, and their\n               attorneys, are so aware.\n\nId. at 549, 102 S.Ct at 802.\n\n        We therefore concluded in Steven I. that the plaintiffs in\nthat case had been afforded ample time to make themselves\naware of the new two-year statute of limitations measured from\nthe date of injury for seeking administrative review under the\nIDEA. We similarly conclude that the Blunt plaintiffs had\nample opportunity to familiarize themselves with the 90-day\nstatute of limitations with respect to judicial actions. In fact, we\neven question whether the application of the 90-day statute of\nlimitations in this case should be regarded as retroactive\ninasmuch as the Blunts did not receive an administrative\ndecision until after the new statute of limitations was in effect,\nand their federal court cause of action did not accrue under the\nIDEA until the final administrative decision in their case. We\nreiterate that the Blunts cannot adequately explain why the\nreasoning in Steven I. should not be applied in a consideration\nof the effectiveness of the 90-day statute of limitations that was\n\n\n                                100\n\fenacted at the same time as the two-year statute of limitations\nfor bringing an administrative action addressed in Steven I. The\nfact is that the Blunts simply have not made a convincing\nargument for applying the two statutes of limitations in the same\namendment to the IDEA in completely different ways.\n\n          D. Whether Appellants Established a Prima\n          Facie Case of Racial Discrimination\n\n        We deal now with appellants’ challenge to the summary\njudgment rendered against them on their § 1983 and Title VI\nclaims, which allege that the LMSD intentionally discriminated\nagainst them because of their race.65 Appellants explain that\n“[t]his case ultimately rests upon a simple question: What\nquantum of evidence must a plaintiff produce to support an\ninference of intentional racial discrimination in order to\novercome a summary judgment motion?” Appellants’ No. 11-\n4200 br. at 21. In addressing the discrimination claims, the\nLMSD responds that, contrary to the plaintiffs’ contentions,\nthey “presented no evidence to establish: (1) that the classes\nthey took were ‘lower level’ and/or ‘below grade-level’”; (2)\n\n65\n  The Blunts and the CBP are not involved with the summary\njudgment as the District Court dismissed their claims before it\nconsidered the motion for summary judgment. We also note\nthat the appeal with respect to the summary judgment on the §\n1983 claim does not include the aspect of the plaintiffs’\ncomplaint under § 1983 to the extent the complaint was based\non the IDEA, ADA, or RA because the Court dismissed the\nplaintiffs’ claims, other than those of the Blunts, under those\nlaws for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n\n                              101\n\fLMSD maintained any specific discriminatory custom, practice\nor policy; or (3) “that similarly situated Caucasian students were\ntreated differently. Indeed, the record is replete with evidence\nthat class placement . . . is driven by the decisions of students\nand parents.” LMSD’s br. at 36. Thus, the LMSD argues that\n“[t]here is . . . no dispute that Plaintiffs have no direct evidence\nof discrimination.” Id. at 37.\n\n       Appellants argue that “if there is any evidence in the\nrecord from which a reasonable inference in the [appellants’]\nfavor may be drawn, the moving party simply cannot obtain a\nsummary judgment.” Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 5-6\n(quoting Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719617\"><a href=\"/opinion/719617/carol-aman-jeanette-johnson-v-cort-furniture-rental-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1081 (3d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nAppellants then conclude that “[LMSD] (and the District Court)\nwere required to accept [all] the testimony of record and any\nlegitimate inference Appellants draw from it, regardless of\nwhether they agreed with those inferences or not,” and that the\nLMSD therefore should not have been granted summary\njudgment. Id. at 5-6 (appellants’ emphasis removed). As stated\nabove, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment a district\ncourt must view the underlying facts and all reasonable\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\nopposing the motion. Genuine and material factual disputes—\nmeaning those that bear on an essential element of the plaintiff’s\nclaim—where the trier of fact could find in favor of the non-\nmoving party must be considered in the light most favorable to\nthe non-movant.\n\n       LMSD was entitled to summary judgment because there\nis no evidence to suggest either that LMSD itself acted with a\n\n\n                                102\n\fdiscriminatory intent, or that it knew of—but failed to correct—\na third party’s intentional discrimination. See S.H., 729 F.3d at\n264. Although appellants present some evidence that African\nAmerican students were overrepresented in a statistical sense in\nspecial education classes, given the record we see no way to\navoid a finding that each individual student’s educational needs\nwere assessed and satisfied through a thorough and\nindividualized process. There is not sufficient evidence to show\nthat the educators and administrators responsible for placing\nstudents intended to discriminate against them because of their\nrace. Moreover, in order to show that LMSD acted with\ndeliberate indifference, appellants must show that it had\nknowledge of rights violations, but there is no evidence in the\nrecord to suggest that it did or that any third party under its\ncontrol engaged in intentional discrimination. See Davis, 526\nU.S. at 646-47 (finding deliberate indifference may be met\nwhere school knows of intentional harassment but fails to act.)\nAppellants argue that the District Court improperly assessed\nwitnesses’ credibility, and discounted its statistical evidence.\nWe discuss these arguments below, but ultimately agree with the\nDistrict Court that the record is insufficient to establish a\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding LMSD’s intent.\n\n                     1. Rejection of Certain Evidence\n                     by the District Court and Alleged\n                     Impermissible Reliance on Other\n                     Evidence Without a Daubert\n                     Hearing.\n\n      As stated above, we review a district court’s decisions on\nadmissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard\n\n\n                              103\n\fwhere a party made known to the district court the substance of\nthe evidence it desires to introduce. Thus, in considering a\ndistrict court’s application of the Federal Rules of Evidence, we\nwill reverse only where “‘there is a definite and firm conviction\nthat the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the\nconclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.’”\n Oddi, 234 F.3d at 146. Here, we conclude that the District\nCourt did not make a clear error of judgment, or, indeed, any\nerror at all in its consideration of the proffered evidence, and\nthat, at trial, the excluded evidence could not have been made\nadmissible. We therefore will uphold all of its rulings regarding\nthe disputed evidence.66\n\n                          a. The MAP Presentation\n\n       Appellants contend that the District Court improperly\ndiscounted a powerpoint presentation discussing a “Minority\nAchievement Program” (MAP). J.A. vol. 5, at 1836-39. The\npresentation included a bulleted list of characteristics of African\nAmerican students and how to teach them effectively. We\nassume the contention that this presentation, if used by LMSD,\n\n66\n  We have not overlooked such cases as Lexington Insurance\nCo. v.

Here,\nhowever, we see no bases on which the deficiencies in the\nevidence could have been cured at the trial.\n\n\n                               104\n\fwould provide evidence of discriminatory intent, or deliberate\nindifference to a third party’s discriminatory intent. Yet we do\nnot see any record evidence from which we could conclude that\nthe LMSD ever used or implemented this presentation. The\npresentation does not contain any indication of who authored it\nor how it is connected to the LMSD.67 Instead, appellants rely\non the testimony of Dr. Barbara Moore-Williams, an education\nconsultant retained by LMSD to help it develop “cultural\nproficiency among staff.” J.A. vol. 4, at 1411. Appellants\nattempt to use her testimony for two purposes: to show that\nLMSD used and implemented the MAP presentation and to\nshow intent.\n\n        In Dr. Moore-Williams’ deposition, appellants’ counsel\nquestioned her about whether she had heard LMSD teachers or\nother personnel refer to specific bullet points from the MAP\npresentation. Id. at 1414. Dr. Moore-Williams responded that\nshe had heard teachers or other personnel refer to some of the\nbullet points. Id. Crucially, however, Dr. Moore-Williams did\nnot testify about the MAP presentation itself—she explains that\nshe had heard LMSD personnel discuss in general the concepts\nraised in the presentation, but that does not establish who\nprepared the presentation, or whether LMSD ever used it or for\nwhat purpose. Indeed, even when Moore-Williams indicated\nthat she had heard of certain bullet points, she noted that they\nwere not related to African American students. See id. at 1414\n\n67\n  The dissent points out that the MAP was produced by LMSD\nduring discovery, but we cannot assume anything from this fact.\n\n\n\n                              105\n\f(explaining, with respect to “active” classes, that she had not\n“heard about it in reference to African-American students”). At\nmost, her testimony is relevant to the extent that she heard from\nLMSD personnel that they used different teaching strategies for\nparticular students. But although purposeful use of such\nstrategies may show racial bias and would be repugnant, it is\nnot, as the dissent suggests, sufficient to show that LMSD\ncreated, used, or implemented the MAP presentation. Finally,\nthe MAP presentation does not show that appellants suffered\nintentional discrimination; it does not discuss placement in\nlower-level classes and, as discussed, there is no evidence that\nthese concepts were applied to LMSD’s individualized special\neducation placement decisions.\n\n                         b. Daniel Reschly’s Report\n\n        Appellants argue that “[t]he District Court erred when it\nfailed to conduct a Daubert hearing but still relied on the\nDistrict’s expert Daniel Reschly’s definitions and principles to\nundercut Appellants’ statistical evidence of discrimination by\nthe District.” Appellants further contend that “the portions of\nReschly’s report relied upon by the District Court form part of\nthe basis for the two paragraphs that are specifically referred to\nin appellants’ form of order,” and thus the District Court erred\nin not holding a Daubert hearing on a motion in limine directed\nat the Reschly report. Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 34-\n38. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Appellants contend that “Reschly’s\nopinions should have no place in this appeal, as they should\nhave had no place in the District Court’s decision to grant\nsummary judgment without a Daubert hearing. This provides\n\n\n                               106\n\fyet another basis to reverse and remand the District Court’s\nruling.” Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 38. However,\nappellants do not specify the “definitions” and “principles” that\nthe District Court adopted from Reschly’s report.\n\n       It may be that appellants’ specific objection with regard\nto Reschly’s report lies with one paragraph of the October 20,\n2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order which refers to\nReschly’s report, consisting of phrases commonly used by those\nstudying the implementation of disability education and services\nunder the IDEA. The paragraph reads:\n\n        Disproportionality is defined as ‘significantly greater or\n       lower participation in special education by one or more\n       groups compared to the participation rates for other\n       groups.’      The preferred methods of analyzing\n       disproportionality are risk and relative risk or risk ratio.\n       Risk is calculated by dividing the number of students\n       with disabilities in a particular group by the total number\n       of students in that group.\n\nNo. 2:07-cv-3100 Doc. No. 180 at 13; J.A. vol. 1, at 16.\n\n        We find this use of Reschly’s wording to define\ndisproportionality to be immaterial to the outcome of this\nlitigation. The District Court did not draw inferences in favor of\neither side from this definition, which, we observe, seems very\nstraightforward. Further, the concepts of risk and relative\nrisk/risk ratio are commonly used statistical terms, and the Court\ndescribed these definitions in the October 20, 2011\nMemorandum and Judgment Order to give the reader a basic\nunderstanding of the statistical data that the plaintiffs presented\n\n                               107\n\fwhich the District Court’s opinion goes on to discuss. We find\nno other “adoption” of Reschly’s views or principles,\nnotwithstanding appellants’ objection to the use of his report.\nAs stated above, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to exclude\nReschly’s expert report as moot, as the Court was able to make a\ndetermination regarding whether plaintiffs had presented a\nprima facie case in its summary judgment analysis without the\nuse of the report.\n\n                   2. Whether the District Court Properly\n                   Viewed the Evidence in the Light Most\n                   Favorable to the Plaintiffs as Non-movants\n                   and Whether Plaintiffs Established a Prima\n                   Facie Case of Discrimination.\n\n        Appellants argue that, when the facts are viewed in the\nlight most favorable to them as non-movants in the District\nCourt, they established a prima facie case under Title VI and §\n1983 applying the Equal Protection Clause. Thus, appellants\ncontend that the Court erred in granting summary judgment\nagainst them on their claims predicated on these bases, as it\nrefused “to view evidence in the light most favorable to [them].”\n Appellants’ No. 11-4200 reply br. at 28. We point out,\nhowever, that a court’s obligation to view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to a non-movant does not require the court\nto take into account evidence that will not be admissible at the\ntrial. Thus, in considering appellants’ argument with respect to\nthe adequacy of the evidence, we take into account our holdings\nwith respect to the evidence in which we uphold the District\nCourt’s disposition of the issues.\n\n        In its October 20, 2011 grant of summary judgment, the\n\n                              108\n\fDistrict Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to “put forth\nany evidence that supports their contention that they were\n‘segregated’ intentionally into inferior education programs in\nviolation of Title VI,” and that “plaintiffs have not raised a\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding their § 1983 cause of\naction” based on the Equal Protection Clause. J.A. vol. 1, at 31-\n35. The Court, in considering the summary judgment motion,\nnoted that the plaintiffs were required to “raise at least some\nreasonable inference that they were placed into classes and\noffered services by the School District due to intentional\ndiscrimination based on their race and not simply due to errors\nin evaluation.” The Court concluded that plaintiffs failed to\noffer evidence sufficient to support an inference that the LMSD\nhad intentionally discriminated against African Americans.\nMoreover, plaintiffs had not put forth more than a scintilla of\nevidence that the LMSD acted with a racially discriminatory\npurpose in identifying them as disabled and placing them in\nspecial education courses regardless of whether this\nidentification was correct. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not\nidentify an official policy or custom that suggested that the\nLMSD was deliberately indifferent to their rights. J.A. vol. 1, at\n32-36.\n\n       We emphasize that, as we explained above, a non-\nmoving party—here, appellants—opposing a motion for\nsummary judgment has the burden to produce evidence\nsupporting its case with respect to material facts of the case on\nwhich it has the burden of proof. Appellants contend that they\nmet this burden because they did offer more than a scintilla of\nevidence in support of their case and that a reasonable fact\nfinder could have found that the evidence of discrimination they\n\n                               109\n\foffered was sufficient to support a finding in their favor. We, of\ncourse, recognize that in some race discrimination situations\nactors do not leave a “smoking gun” evidencing their intent, and\nin such cases plaintiffs can prove their cases only with\ncircumstantial evidence. In this case, however, the piecemeal\nanecdotes to which appellants point were insufficient to survive\nLMSD’s summary judgment motion.\n\n        The appellants attempt to meet this standard by pointing\nto an email by a member of the LMSD School Board, which\nthey believe supported their prima facie case of discrimination\nwhen read in a light most favorable to them and considered as a\npart of the case as a whole. In discussing school redistricting to\nincrease minority representation in certain schools, one member\nof the School Board apparently wrote an email expressing his\nconcern that “moving any of the low income and African\nAmerican students to Harriton [High School] when they can\nwalk to [Lower Merion High School] simply creates an\nadditional stressor that doesn’t need to be there.” Appellants’\nNo. 11-4200 reply br. at 26.\n\n        Appellants believe that “[f]rom that comment, a\nreasonable jury could conclude that [LMSD] fostered an\ninstitutional culture (expressed by at least one Board member)\nthat tolerated racial insensitivity and viewed African Americans\n[sic] students as creating unnecessary ‘stress.’” Appellants’ No.\n11-4200 reply br. at 27. But we do not need to decide how a\nreasonable jury could construe this email because even though it\nwas available when depositions were taken and a witness other\nthan its author referred to it on a deposition, it was not properly\nsubmitted to the District Court as it was not introduced into\n\n\n                               110\n\fevidence and its author was not deposed. Consequently,\nappellants cannot rely on the email to defeat the motion for\nsummary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).68 Thus, the\nemail did not contribute to the admissible evidence appellants\nneeded to have survived summary judgment.\n\n          Appellants also argue that the District Court wrongly\ndiscounted the deposition testimony of Dr. Moore-Williams, an\nindependent consultant that the LMSD had engaged prior to this\nlitigation to address minority issues in the LMSD, as being\nbased on her personal beliefs and on hearsay. In considering\nthis testimony, the Court found that her opinions were not based\non anything that she had observed firsthand, but rather\nconcerned attitudes about race in the country and the education\nsystem in general. Appellants seem to conflate the issue of\nadmissibility of evidence with the requirement of taking\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant when\nconsidering a summary judgment motion. Thus, during oral\nargument, appellants’ counsel argued that the District Court\n\n68\n  As far as we can tell, the original email was submitted in an\nunrelated case against the LMSD, Doe v.

We also\npoint out that when the scope of this litigation is considered it is\nnot easy to understand how an email by one school board\nmember expressing concern about putting stress on students by\nrequiring that they be transferred away from a school to which\nthey can walk supports the allegations of the complaint. But we\ndo not predicate our result on this observation.\n\n\n\n\n                                111\n\fshould have found that there was evidence that LMSD\ncommitted an intentional wrong against African American\nstudents in its schools, not only because it did not consider the\nMAP presentation, but because it also wrongly discounted\nMoore-Williams’ testimony as hearsay. Tr. Oral Arg. June 11,\n2013, at 51-52. While the MAP issue seems to concern\nadmissibility, it is clear from the October 20, 2011\nMemorandum and Judgment Order that the Court did consider\nMoore-Williams’ deposition testimony, and appellants referred\nto this testimony in their oral arguments on October 4, 2011, in\nthe District Court on the summary judgment motion.69 No.\n2:07-cv-3100 Doc. No. 180 at 25.\n\n       The District Court’s October 20, 2011 Memorandum and\nJudgment Order found that references to Moore-Williams’\ntestimony by the plaintiffs during the October 4, 2011 oral\nargument was “selective and misleading,” and that she had\n“admit[ted] that her statements about the School District [we]re\nnot based on anything she observed firsthand but rather on her\nown personal belief and the hearsay statements of others.\nAccordingly, her statements cannot create a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact regarding the School District’s intent to\n\n69\n  Although appellants objected to the limited weight the District\nCourt gave Moore-Williams’ testimony both in their briefs and\nat oral argument, and made reference to her deposition in the\nappendix, they do not claim to have made a formal motion in\nlimine regarding Moore-Williams’ testimony seeking to have it\nconsidered, nor have they pointed to an order denying its\nadmission or consideration by the District Court.\n\n\n                              112\n\fdiscriminate.” Id. In this regard, we do not see how the\ndeficiencies in her testimony could have been cured so that the\nevidence could have become admissible at trial. Clearly, we\ncannot say that the District Court erred in its treatment of her\nevidence.70\n\n        Indeed, putting aside inadmissible evidence, the\nallegations in all of the complaints and briefs are inconsistent in\ntheir logic. For example, appellants seem to be complaining\nboth that LMSD’s placement of individual students in special\neducation courses has taken them away from “regular” courses,\nwhile at the same time alleging that they did not receive\nadequate special education and support.71 It is unclear what\nactions LMSD could have taken that plaintiffs would deem\nappropriate. In order to participate in full schedules of both\nspecial education and regular education classes, students would\nneed a longer school day than students taking only regular\neducation classes. Further, if individual students require extra\n\n70\n  We note that inasmuch as the Blunts do not appeal from the\nOctober 20, 2011 Memorandum and Judgment Order granting\nsummary judgment, we will not address their allegations.\n\n\n71\n   One example, among many, is found in the following\nparagraph of the TAC: “Denying these Plaintiffs and the class\nthe opportunity to participate in and benefit from federally-\nassisted regular education services, program and activities,\nincluding special education and related services . . .” TAC at\npara. 175(a); J.A. vol. 9, at 3889 (emphases added).\n\n\n                               113\n\fhelp in particular subjects, obviously it is counterintuitive to\nprotest that, for example, they are not receiving foreign language\ninstruction during the time that they are participating in remedial\ncourses.\n\n        We also point out that at various points in the SAC the\nplaintiffs express dissatisfaction with grades that are too low,\nand at other points complain of grades that are too high.\nPlaintiffs seem to believe that the divergence in grades\ndemonstrates that they were placed in courses that either were\ntoo easy or too difficult, depending on which plaintiff they are\ndiscussing.72 But student placement is not an exact science, and\ndifferent children have different needs. We repeatedly have\nexplained that the teachers and parents, school districts, and\nadministrative review boards are closest to the issues at hand,\nand therefore they are the best persons or entities to address\nindividual concerns and complaints. Of course, this recognition\nunderlies the need for the exhaustion requirements of the IDEA.\n\n\n                      3. Statistical Evidence\n\n       In Meditz v. City of Newark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"614325\"><a href=\"/opinion/614325/meditz-v-city-of-newark/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (3d Cir.\n2011), we cited several Supreme Court cases to support our\nconclusion that gross statistical disparities may serve to establish\na plaintiff’s prima facie case in a Title VII case if the statistical\n\n72\n  By this reasoning the only acceptable grade that would not\ngive rise to a legal claim might be a “C,” and the giving of any\nother grade might be viewed as evidence that a school district\nwas at fault for not providing an appropriate education.\n\n\n                                114\n\fevidence is of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the\npolicy or practice in question caused the discrimination. In\nconsidering the statistical evidence in this case, we note first that\nfor monetary damages to be awarded under Title VI, the\ndiscrimination must be intentional. See, e.g., Lane v.

However, even if this were\nnot the case and we simply applied the analysis we articulated in\nthe Meditz Title VII case, the statistics do not indicate gross\ndisparities of the kind and degree sufficient to give rise to an\ninference that the non-uniform individualized analyses of\nstudents in the LMSD, utilized to determine appropriate\nclassroom placement, reflected a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination.\n\n        The District Court in its October 20, 2011 Memorandum\nand Judgment Order discussed in detail the statistical data that\nthe plaintiffs put forward. No. 2:07-cv-3100, Doc. No. 180 at\n13-18. As the Court pointed out, “[d]isproportionality is not per\nse evidence of discrimination” and, as plaintiffs’ own experts\nhave acknowledged, disproportionality can be either biased or\nunbiased. Id. at 14. Noting that “[t]here is no specific\nnumerical criteria for disproportionality set forth in the IDEA or\nfederal regulations,” the Court explained that the PDE has\nestablished guidelines whereby it considers a disproportionality\nof 3.0, i.e., three to one, to be an indication of over-\nrepresentation of that race, while the United States Department\nof Education’s guidelines indicate that a 1.5 disproportionality\nratio is an overrepresentation of that race. Id. at 14-15.\n\n                                115\n\f                       The District Court summarized the data presented by\n               plaintiffs (collected by the PDE) for the LMSD for the years\n               2005-2010 as follows:\n\n       Total student body at LMSD         Students Participating in special education courses\n\n                   %      of\n                   total\n                   number                               % of total\n                   of                     Total         student       %       of   %       of\n                   students               Number of body that         special      special\n                   who         % of total students that participate   education    education\n     Total         were        number of participated d          in   students     students\n     Number        African     students   in special special          who were     who were\n     of            America     who were education       education     African      Caucasia\nYear students      n           Caucasian courses        courses       American     n\n\n’05-   6,945       7.7%        84.4%      1,255          18.1%        12.7%        82.6%\n‘06\n\n’06-   6,981       7.9%        83.2%      1,187          17.0%        14.5%        80.2%\n‘07\n\n’07-   6,914       8.1%        83.1%      1,158          16.7%        14.0%        80.8%\n‘08\n\n’08-   6,788       8.0%        81.6%      1,101          16.2%        13.7%        80.5%\n‘09\n\n’09-   7,072       8.6%        81.1%      1,094          15.5%        14.3%        80.0%\n‘10\n\n\n                                            116\n\fId. at 16-17. Though these numbers undoubtedly show that it\nwas more likely that an African American student than a\nCaucasian student would be placed in a special education\ncourse, the numbers are not so disproportionate that they suggest\nthe presence of discrimination in student placement absent\nadditional evidence that could justify drawing this inference.\n\n        In considering the statistics, it is critical to recognize that\nthere was no evidence presented in the District Court that the\nLMSD applied different evaluation procedures for determining\nplacement of African American students than for Caucasian\nstudents. After all, if the same evaluation procedures are used\nfor all students regardless of their race there simply is no\ndiscrimination. Moreover, the opinion of the plaintiffs’ expert,\na psychologist, that five or six of the students in question\nincorrectly had been identified as learning disabled was not\nrendered until these proceedings were pending in the District\nCourt and was insufficient to support a prima facie case for the\nplaintiffs, particularly inasmuch as she predicated her opinion\non her personal evaluation of the students.\n\n        In fact, we doubt that anyone could explain better than\nLMSD’s counsel did at oral argument why the divergence of\nviews on student placement should not be a basis to support\nplaintiffs’ claims:\n\n       [LMSD] has procedures in place that are followed\n       for all students. And the fact a psychologist could\n       disagree with [LMSD’s] psychologist and say\n       ‘No, I don’t think this person met these criteria’\n\n                                 117\n\f       doesn’t prove or produce any evidence to suggest\n       that that was as a result of these students’ races.\n       The psychologist did not [attempt] . . . to\n       ascertain . . . that identification process . . . to see\n       if there was perhaps some other indicia that could\n       be pointed to as to why that occurred. Instead, it\n       was simply, ‘I don’t believe these students were\n       [properly] identified.’ From that, the plaintiffs\n       had made the leap that therefore it must be\n       because of their race.\n\nTr. Oral Arg. June 11, 2013, at 37-38.\n\n        In reaching our result, in addition to considering the\nstatistics we have cited and plaintiffs’ expert’s claim that\nstudents were misidentified, we have considered plaintiffs’\nallegation that a small number of special education classes at\nLMSD were comprised of 100% African American students.\nBut the problem with that evidence is that it was not offered in a\ncontext from which a meaningful correlation between race and\nclass placement could be demonstrated because plaintiffs did not\naccompany it with testing data, grading, and other factors that\nmight provide some meaning to the evidence that they offered.\nUnder the IDEA structure, school districts that accept federal\nfunds such as the LMSD must treat every student as an\nindividual, and thus must evaluate, test, and monitor the student\nindividually, as well as provide an IEP for the student on an\nindividual basis. If by following this mandate a school district\nshould make a special education placement for a particular\nstudent, the school district should not decline to make the\nplacement merely because the application of the mandate leads\n\n\n                                118\n\fto students of a particular group being statistically\noverrepresented in special education grouping. We certainly are\nnot going to require or even suggest that school districts use a\nquota system in assigning students to special education classes\nso that the percentages of students in such classes be\nproportionate to overall school ratios when measured on a racial\nbasis. A school district has the function of educating its\nstudents, and should be concerned with that critical matter rather\nthan with producing particular statistics.\n\n        Appellants’ evidence of discrimination consists of\nstatistical evidence that African American students were\noverrepresented in special education classes, testimony\nindicating that certain LMSD educators had discussed different\nlearning styles and an email from a School Board member\nexpressing concern about putting extra stress on black students.\nHowever, the record also reflects that each individual student’s\neducational needs were assessed and satisfied through a\nthorough and individualized IEP process, and contains no\nevidence that the educators and administrators responsible for\nplacing students intended to discriminate against them because\nof their race. Taking the record as a whole and drawing all\ninferences in appellants’ favor, there is no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact that LMSD itself—or a third party under its\ncontrol—engaged in intentional discrimination.\n\n\n\n                     VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       First, we hold that the District Court correctly held that\nthe action against the PDE was barred by principles of res\n\n                               119\n\fjudicata (claim preclusion) as a result of the settlement of the\nclass action in Gaskin v. Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2498158\"><a href=\"/opinion/2498158/gaskin-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nWe reach that conclusion because the Gaskin class included all\nschool-age students with disabilities in Pennsylvania who were\ndenied a FAPE, and the claims pleaded against the PDE in this\ncase were brought on behalf of students within the Gaskin class.\n Thus, the claims asserted against the PDE in this case overlap\nwith the claims that had been brought against it in Gaskin.\n\n        Next, in reviewing the District Court’s conclusions\nregarding the IDEA’s statute of limitations for a party adversely\naffected by an administrative determination of an IDEA claim to\nbring a state or federal suit, we hold that the Court correctly\nconcluded that the 90-day statute of limitations barred the\nBlunts’ IDEA claims. In reaching this result, we hold that it did\nnot matter that the Blunts’ administrative judicial process began\non April 8, 2005, a date on which the IDEA’s statute of\nlimitations for bringing a claim in state or federal court after\nreceiving an adverse administrative determination was two\nyears, because the Blunts’ final administrative disposition was\non August 31, 2005, almost two months after the 90-day statute\nof limitations came into effect, and almost nine months after\nCongress enacted it. Contrary to the Blunts’ contention, the\namended statute of limitations was not unfairly retroactively\napplied, for they had nine months notice regarding the\namendment of the statute of limitations before their IDEA action\nwas barred; thus they had ample time to bring their case. In\nfact, inasmuch as their cause of action did not arise until after\nthe amendment of the statute of limitations, it is fair to say that\nthe amendment simply was not applied retroactively in their\ncase. Further, as noted above, the Blunts had the responsibility\n\n                               120\n\fto be vigilant about changes in legislation, including statutes of\nlimitation. Our reasoning in Steven I. regarding the shortened\nIDEA statute of limitations for bringing an administrative claim\nplainly applies here with respect to the judicial claim.\n\n       Judge Greenberg concludes that CBP did not have\nstanding to sue on its own behalf or on behalf of its members,\nbut Judges Ambro and McKee conclude that the District Court\nerred in dismissing CBP for lack of standing because CBP had\norganizational standing under Havens. Although a majority of\nthe Court thus does not accept the District Court’s ruling that\nCBP did not have standing, this conclusion does not change our\noutcome in light of a different majority’s independent\nconclusion that the Court properly entered summary judgment\nagainst the plaintiffs, as CBP has not explained why it could\nhave prevailed where the individual plaintiffs did not.\n\n        We also hold that the District Court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in how it dealt with disputed evidence. The Court\nwas correct in determining that the MAP presentation was not\nauthenticated, and it did not abuse its discretion in discounting\nMoore-Williams’ testimony or in not giving it more weight than\nit did. Further, the Court did not err in its use of Reschly’s\nreport.\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs did not establish a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VI or § 1983; thus, the entry\nof summary judgment against them on their claims under those\nlaws was appropriate. Evidence that the District Court found to\nbe inadmissible need not have been considered in a light most\nfavorable to the non-movant plaintiffs because the evidence\ncould not have become admissible at trial. Further, the evidence\n\n                               121\n\fbefore the Court did not support a circumstantial prima facie\ncase of racial discrimination in violation of Title VI or § 1983.\nIn particular, the statistical evidence was insufficient to establish\na prima facie case even when considered with other evidence.\n\n        The IDEA’s goal is to ensure that educators and parents\nhave necessary tools to improve educational results of disabled\nstudents. See 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(3) (stating as one purpose of\nthe IDEA, “to ensure that educators and parents have the\nnecessary tools to improve educational results for children with\ndisabilities by supporting system improvement activities”). As\nwe have noted in the past, it is not necessarily the case that\nwhen students do not achieve equal results from their education\nthere is a constitutional violation.

CBP, who shared counsel with some of\nthe individual Plaintiffs, has not explained how, were it\npermitted to continue as a plaintiff in the case, it could prevail\nwhere the individual Plaintiffs have failed. Thus I agree with\nJudge Greenberg’s disposition of these appeals on their\nmerits. For these reasons, I concur.\n\fBlunt v. Lower Merion Nos. 11-4200, 11-4201, 11-4315\n\nMcKee, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart.\n\n       Today we hold that a group of African-American\nparents and students have not produced sufficient evidence to\nhave a jury decide if race is a factor in how African-American\nstudents are assigned to special education classes in their\nschool district. My colleagues reach this result even though\nthe record contains numerous issues of disputed fact that\nwould support plaintiffs’ claims if a jury resolved those\ndisputes in the plaintiffs’ favor.\n\n       The allegations here are not pretty. No one likes to\nthink that a school district, especially one with an outstanding\neducational reputation, allows race to be a factor in assigning\nAfrican-American students to special education classes.\nHowever, there is sufficient evidence on this record to\nestablish that a trial is warranted to determine whether this\nschool district did exactly that. I therefore write separately to\nexpress my strong disagreement with my colleagues’\nconclusion that these plaintiffs cannot survive summary\njudgment.\n\n      Despite that strong disagreement, I do agree that the\nGaskin settlement bars the Title VI and § 1983 claims that\nhave been brought against the Pennsylvania Department of\nEducation (“PDE”) as discussed in Section VII.A of the\nMajority Opinion.1\n\n        The District Court’s August 19, 2009 ruling that the\nsettlement agreement bars claims against the PDE sets forth\nthe relevant language of the settlement agreement. That\nagreement identified the plaintiffs as: “representatives of a\ncertified class consisting of all school-age students with\ndisabilities in Pennsylvania who have been denied a free\nappropriate education in regular classrooms with\nindividualized supportive services, individualized instruction,\n\n1\n I also join Part VII.C of the Majority Opinion in which my\ncolleagues discuss the statute of limitations.\n\fand accommodations they need to succeed in the regular\neducation classroom.”      Blunt v.

Although, as counsel for CBP noted\nat oral argument, those claims are very different from the\nclaims here, the language of the settlement agreement is very\nbroad in its scope and provides in part as follows:\n\n [i]n consideration of the performance of PDE’s obligations under\n     the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiffs, individually and\n collectively hereby remise, release, and forever discharge each of\nthe defendants […] from all actions and causes of action, suits, . . .\nclaims and demands whatsoever . . . , known or unknown, foreseen\n  or unforeseen, particularly those which were or could have been\nset forth in Gaskin v. Pennsylvania Department of Education, No.\n 94-CV-4048 (E.D.

(ellipses and bold type and italics emphasis in original,\nunderline emphasis added). The claims in this suit, though\nquite different from the claims in Gaskin, are clearly “related\nto the claims brought by the plaintiffs . . . in the Gaskin case.”\n\n        However, for the reasons that follow, I cannot agree\nthat Concerned Black Parents, Inc. (“CBP”) lacks standing\n(as discussed in Section VII.B of the Majority Opinion) or\nthat the District Court properly granted summary judgment on\nthe claims that these Plaintiffs brought against the Lower\nMerion School District (“LMSD”) under Title VI and 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 (as discussed in Section VII.D of the Majority\nOpinion).\n\n                     I. CBP’S STANDING\n                     A. General Principles\n\n        As Judge Greenberg explains, Article III requires a\nplaintiff to demonstrate a sufficient interest in the outcome of\nlitigation to establish a “case or controversy” and thus have\nstanding to sue on the plaintiff’s own behalf or as a\n\n\n                                   2\n\frepresentative of others.2 As the Supreme Court explained in\nWarth v.

[e]ven in the absence of injury to itself, an\nassociation may have standing solely as a representative of its\nmembers.” 422 U.S. at 511 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       The District Court held that CBP was unable to\ndemonstrate a sufficiently concrete injury to itself or the\nparents it represents to have standing to bring this suit. Blunt,\n262 F.R.D. at 486. In rejecting CBP’s claim of standing, the\nDistrict Court focused on the fact that CBP is not a student\nand therefore could only demonstrate “an abstract, ideological\n\n2\n   Judge Greenberg properly notes that his discussion of\nCBP’s standing is not the holding of this Court, because\nJudge Ambro agrees that CBP has personal standing. See\nMajority Opinion (“Majority Op.”) at 97-98 & n.72.\nHowever, for reasons of convenience and clarity, with the\nexception of Judge Greenberg’s discussion of personal\nstanding, I frequently refer to his opinion in its entirety as the\n“Majority Opinion,” or the opinion of “my colleagues.”\n    Judge Greenberg engages in a very detailed analysis to\nexplain why he believes that CBP lacks standing. He\nexplains that such a detailed analysis is appropriate because\n“[w]e . . . will not avoid deciding the standing issue on the\nground that it is moot, for the necessity for a party to have\nstanding is jurisdictional and thus a court of appeals always\nmust determine if the district court . . . had jurisdiction.”\nMajority Op. at 73 n.62. However, there is no dispute\nwhatsoever about the standing of the individual plaintiffs, nor\ncould there be. Accordingly, the jurisdiction of the District\nCourt and this Court is clear and undisputed. Accordingly,\nJudge Greenberg’s discussion of standing is dicta. See Galli\nv.

However, both Judge Ambro\nand Judge Greenberg believe that CBP’s standing is irrelevant\n  because they do not believe CBP can prevail on the merits.\n Majority Opinion (“Majority Op.”) at 98-99 n.72; Ambro at\n 1. Of course, CBP’s likelihood of success on the merits has\n no bearing on its standing. The issue of CBP’s standing not\n   only “matter[s], it is of the utmost importance . . .” as our\n       decision here is precedential and can impact other\n    organizations in the future. “In essence, the question of\n  standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court\n    decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.”\n                     Warth, 422 U.S. at 498.\n\n       Moreover, the standing issue is dispositive for\npurposes of the merits of CBP’s appeal of the August 19,\n2009 judgment because we are not affirming that judgment.\nAs the Majority Opinion correctly notes, “[a]ppeals are taken\nfrom judgments, not opinions.” Majority Op. at 98 n.72\n(citing Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842 (1984)). CBP appealed the District\nCourt’s August 19, 2009 judgment. That judgment states:\n\n3\n  The District Court also held that CBP did not have\nrepresentational standing because its bylaws stated that CBP\nhad no members, and “in light of this express statement in a\nformal document governing . . . the corporation, [the District\nCourt concluded] that [CBP] does not have standing to bring\nsuit on behalf of its members because it has none.” Id. at 487.\nI do not discuss the issue of whether CBP has representational\nstanding because there is no need to. Judge Ambro and I\nagree that CBP has standing to sue based on its own injuries.\nI do note that the District Court failed to appreciate the extent\nor nature of CBP’s own injuries or the nature of CBP’s efforts\nto advance the interests of parents of African-American\nchildren in the LMSD.\n\n                                4\n\f“the motion of defendants, the Lower Merion School District\nand the Lower Merion School Board, to dismiss the claims of\nConcerned Black Parents of Mainline, Inc. and the Mainline\nBranch of the NAACP for lack of standing is GRANTED.”\nJoint Appendix (“J.A.”) at 42.69 (emphasis added). It is\ntherefore beyond dispute that CBP was dismissed from the\ncase because of standing, and only because of standing.\nBecause a majority of this Court now holds that CBP does\nhave standing, see, e.g., Majority Op. at 97, the District\nCourt’s August 19, 2009 judgment must be reversed as to the\ndismissal of CBP.\n\n        Thus, it is simply inaccurate to claim that our holding\nregarding standing “does not change [the] outcome in light of\na different majority’s conclusion that [the District Court]\nproperly entered summary judgment against the plaintiffs.”\nMajority Op. at 97. The appeal from the District Court’s\njudgment granting summary judgment against the individual\nplaintiffs must be decided separately because it arises from a\ndiscrete judgment. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 467 U.S. at 842.\nFurthermore, any suggestion that CBP must explain “why it\ncould have prevailed where the individual plaintiffs did not,”\nsee Majority Op. at 97, has no basis in the law. Because CBP\nwas dismissed from the litigation on a motion to dismiss, it\nwas unable to engage in the same discovery as other parties;\nno summary judgment motion was filed against it and it\ntherefore did not have a full opportunity to fairly oppose\nsummary judgment.\n\n        When the District Court dismissed CBP for lack of\nstanding, it did so without any motion to dismiss or motion\nfor summary judgment being filed against CBP. The\nMajority is correct that the District Court considered CBP’s\nstanding twice—once before the Third Amended Complaint\nand once after it—and discovery was taken after the first\ndismissal, Majority Op. at 59 n.52. However, that does not\nresolve the procedural issue here. Plaintiffs filed for class\ncertification. In opposing that certification, defendants\nargued that CBP could not serve as a class representative, but\nthe defendants did not move to dismiss CBP from the lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\fJ.A. at 918-19. Rather, the District Court sua sponte\ndismissed CBP for lack of standing. J.A. at 42.69.4\n\n       While the Majority is correct in noting that a judgment\nmay be affirmed for any reason that is supported by the\nrecord, this record is more than adequate to survive summary\njudgment based on the standing of CBP as well as the\nindividual plaintiffs. Judge Ambro and I agree that CBP has\ndemonstrated that it is entitled to personal standing under\nHavens Realty Corp. Ambro at 1. However, unlike Judges\nAmbro and Greenberg, I also believe there is sufficient\nevidence to survive dismissal on the merits of the relevant\ndiscrimination claims. As I discuss in detail below, the\nDistrict Court failed to properly credit some evidence, and\n\n4\n  Although the District Court notes that defendants “move to\ndismiss the claims of Concerned Black Parents . . . for lack of\nstanding,” J.A. at 924-25, defendants’ motion makes no such\nclaim. Instead, as part of its argument that plaintiffs’\nproposed class representatives cannot adequately represent\nthe class, defendants’ motion states: “Plaintiffs’ evidence\ndoes nothing to establish CBP’s standing and completely fails\nto address the fact that CBP is not a member of the proposed\nclass and therefore cannot be a class representative.” J.A. at\n919.\n\n    Plaintiffs were neither required, nor expected, to present\nevidence to establish CBP’s standing in order to move for\nclass certification. It is therefore not the least bit surprising\nthat they did not then attempt to come forward with evidence\nto establish standing. It appears that the District Court\nfocused on the defendants’ comment about standing and\ntransformed it into a motion attacking standing. J.A. at 928.\nThe District Court then focused on CBP’s lack of formal\nmembership, and concluded that CBP “does not have\nstanding to bring suit on behalf of its members,” ostensibly\naddressing plaintiffs’ claims that CBP may represent the\nclass. J.A. at 932. The District Court then concluded:\n“[a]ccordingly, we will enter an order dismissing Concerned\nBlack parents from this lawsuit for lack of standing.” Id. The\nDistrict Court does not state that it is granting summary\njudgment against CBP for lack of standing. Rather, it simply\nstated that it was “dismissing” CBP. Id.\n\n                                6\n\fimproperly discredited or ignored other evidence. When the\nevidence here is properly viewed in its entirety, the record\nestablishes genuine issues of material fact pertaining to Plaintiffs’\nclaims under Title VI and § 1983, and the resulting harm. See\ninfra Section III at 30-60. CBP has also presented sufficient\nevidence to raise a genuine dispute of material fact regarding harm\nit suffered as a result of the LMSD’s conduct. See infra Section\nI.B at 7-19.\n\n       For these reasons, the August 19, 2009 order, must be\nreversed as to CBP’s dismissal for lack of standing; a\nmajority of this Court now holds that CBP does have\nstanding.\n\nB. CBP’s Personal Standing\n\n        An organization has standing to assert its own injuries\n(“personal standing”) when it can show: (1) a concrete and\nparticularized injury-in-fact, (2) a causal connection between\nthe injury and the conduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood\nof redressability.

In Havens Realty Corp. v.

The\nnonprofit organization there (“HOME”) was committed “to\nmak[ing] equal opportunity in housing a reality in the\nRichmond Metropolitan Area.” Id. at 368 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted). In furtherance of its mission,\nHOME counseled potential renters and undertook\ninvestigations to determine if landlords were discriminating\nagainst potential tenants by “steering” them to particular\n\n\n                                  7\n\frental units or neighborhoods based on race. Id. at 368-69.\nHOME sent “testers” of different races into the community\nwhere they inquired about advertised rental units to determine\nif certain landlords were engaged in racially discriminatory\nsteering. Id. at 368. As part of its investigation, HOME sent\ntwo testers to inquire about rental properties owned by\nHavens Realty Corporation (“Havens”). Id. The African-\nAmerican tester was incorrectly told that certain apartments\nwere not available. Id. Simultaneously, the Caucasian tester\nwas told that the very same apartments were available. Id.\n\n       HOME sued Havens for housing discrimination,\nalleging that it had standing to sue in its own right and on\nbehalf of its constituents. Id. HOME claimed it had itself\nbeen injured because Havens’ conduct “frustrated the\norganization’s counseling and referral services, with a\nconsequent drain on resources.” Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court agreed. The Court reasoned that\nwhere an organization’s ability to provide its primary services\nhas been “perceptibly impaired,” the organization has\npersonal standing to attempt recover for its injuries. Id. at\n379. HOME asserted that it had “been frustrated by\ndefendants’ racial steering practices in its efforts to assist\nequal access to housing through counseling and other referral\nservices.” Id. That was sufficient to allege an Article III\ninjury.     The Court explained: “[s]uch concrete and\ndemonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the\nconsequent drain on the organization’s resources—constitutes\nfar more than simply a setback in the organization’s abstract\nsocial interests.” Id. Specifically, HOME’s complaint\nincluded an allegation that it “[had] to devote significant\nresources to identify and counteract the defendant’s [sic]\nracially discriminatory steering practices.” Id. (brackets in\noriginal). The additional expense and the need to counteract\nHavens’ allegedly discriminatory conduct was a sufficiently\nparticularized and concrete injury to confer standing upon\nHOME. Id.\n\n       We elaborated on Havens Realty in Montgomery\nNewspapers. There, the defendants raised the same issues\nraised in Havens Realty, but on a motion for summary\njudgment. 141 F.3d at 73. The plaintiff there was a nonprofit\n\n                               8\n\forganization that worked “to educate and promote fair\nhousing and to oppose segregation based on the protected\nclasses found in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended.”\nId. In an effort to advance that objective, the organization\nsued multiple defendants, including a newspaper that had run\nadvertisements that appeared to perpetuate housing\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender and familial status. 5 Id.\nThe plaintiff’s response to the defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment relied heavily on Havens Realty. The\nplaintiff argued that it had sufficiently alleged its own injuries\nbecause the defendant newspaper’s “acceptance and\npublication of discriminatory housing advertisements\nfrustrated the organization’s mission and [damaged] the\norganization . . . by . . . divert[ing] resources to fight the\ndiscrimination.” Id.\n\n        We granted summary judgment to the defendants, but\nonly because the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence to\nsupport its alleged injuries. “[S]omething more than . . .\nnaked allegations were required at the summary judgment\nstage.” Id. at 76. We explained that the nonprofit “was\nrequired to submit affidavits or other evidence showing\nthrough specific facts … that … it [was] directly affected by\nthe alleged discrimination.” Id. (italics, brackets, and ellipses\nin original, bold emphasis added, internal quotation marks\nomitted). The organization had not produced any evidence\nthat it had “altered its operations in any way as a result of the\nallegedly discriminatory advertisements or diverted any of its\nresources to a bona fide investigation.” Id. at 78. “[B]are\nallegations of injury such as those based on the investigation\ndescribed [there were] not enough to establish standing.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we held that\nthe organization had not established an Article III injury.\n\n\n\n\n  5\n    “The complaint included copies of six advertisements which\n  appeared in Montgomery newspapers between November, 1993\n and March, 1994. Each of these advertisements contained one of\n  the following allegedly objectionable phrases: ‘mature person’,\n ‘ideal for quiet and reserved single and-or couple’; ‘professional\n      male … only’ and ‘quiet mature setting.’” Montgomery\n                    Newspapers, 141 F.3d at 73.\n\n                                 9\n\f       Thus, Montgomery Newspapers involved a failure of\nproof. It does not support the conclusion that CBP has failed\nto introduce sufficient evidence of its own injury to survive\nsummary judgment here.\n\n       As discussed in detail below, CBP produced sufficient\nevidence of its own concrete and particularized injuries to\ncreate an Article III case or controversy.

The harm African-American\nstudents allegedly suffered here cannot readily be amputated\nfrom a concomitant harm to their parents or to an\norganization that devoted scarce resources to remedying it.\nAfter all, the nonprofit organization in Havens Realty had not\nbeen denied housing. Yet, the Supreme Court ruled that the\nnonprofit had standing to challenge discriminatory housing\npractices because it had been forced to devote its own\nresources to its efforts to remedy racial discrimination in the\nhousing market. See Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379.\n\n       Here, CBPs purpose includes efforts to “promote\nequity and excellence” in education for diverse students. It\nadvances that purpose by addressing “issues related to\neducation for populations identified as minority and/or\nAfrican-American.” Blunt and CBP Appellants’ Br. at 11.\nThere is no suggestion that this statement of purpose is\ninaccurate. Given that purpose, the record establishes that\nCBP has an interest in the outcome of the litigation, and that\nthe alleged discriminatory conduct of LMSD negatively\naffects the organization’s central activities, requiring it to\nincur extra expenses and provide resources to mitigate\nLMSD’s conduct. Blunt, 262 F.R.D. at 486; see also J.A. at\n3169.\n\n       Judge Greenberg lists several of the injuries that CBP\nalleges, but ignores the evidence produced to support those\ninjuries. See Majority Op. at. 62-63. The following\nnumbered headings recite some of the injuries Judge\nGreenberg lists, and the discussion that follows each heading\nexplains where supporting evidence can be found in this\nrecord:7\n              [1] Use of its resources to ‘host educational\n              consultants and experts’ with the purpose of\n              providing information to the Plaintiffs, class\n              members, community and LMSD;\n\n\n7\n Majority Op. at 62-63(citing TAC at 25-26; J.A. vol. 9, at\n3871-72) (footnote omitted) (I have added bracketed numbers\nand bold emphasis for ease of reference).\n\n                               11\n\f       CBP hosted numerous educational events featuring\neducational consultants and experts. These experts were paid\nto speak to parents about the effects of the LMSD’s conduct\nand how to counteract the consequences of that conduct.\nCBP’s president, Loraine Carter, testified that, “[s]ince 2006,\n[CBP has] coordinated public forums for parents in the\ncommunity” by bringing in experts “to address the\nunderachievement of African-Americans in the School\nDistrict.” J.A. at 3167. Moreover, CBP’s newsletter\nreferences numerous speaking events held each month with\nprominent scholars and educational leaders. Id. at 1495. For\nexample, in January 2004, CBP met with Dr. Donald Clark\nregarding educational law, history, and policy as it pertains to\nboth African-American students and Pennsylvania. Id. In\nFebruary 2004, it arranged for Dr. Freya Rivers, an\neducational consultant, to speak at a CBP meeting regarding\nstrategies she uses to identify high achieving children and\n“closing the achievement gap.” Id. CBP also listed the\nfollowing activities, among others, in its Fall of 2004\nschedule: “Special Education Action Roundtable; Youth\nTown Hall Meetings; Education Empowerment Sessions;\nAdvocacy Training Sessions.” Id.\n\n              [2] A ‘sharp’ rise in expenditures over the\n              last five years due to its efforts to ‘protect its\n              members from the adverse impact’ of ‘the\n              inferior quality of LMSD’s dual system of\n              education’;\n\n       There is evidence that CBP incurred expenses\nresponding to the allegedly discriminatory conditions at\nLMSD and the resulting need to advocate on behalf of parents\nseeking to change the educational circumstances of their\nchildren. Id. at 3169. From December 2005 to March 2006,\nCBP had an income of approximately $1,090 and expenses of\n$1,106. Id. Like HOME in Havens Realty, CBP had to divert\nits scarce resources to counseling and otherwise supporting\nAfrican-American families who were allegedly being\ndiscriminated against by LMSD, in order to minimize the\nimpact of LMSD’s purportedly discriminatory attitudes and\nactions toward African-American students. Evidence that\nCBP’s expenses exceeded its income constitutes far more\nthan the bare allegations of the complaint in Montgomery\n\n                                12\n\fNewspapers; this evidence demonstrates that CBP suffered a\ndiscrete and cognizable injury as a result of LMSD’s conduct.\n\n              [3] Expenditure of resources as a result of its\n              attending meetings related to IEPs, Section\n              504 and ‘disciplinary meetings, court\n              hearings and parent-teacher conferences\n              with and/or on behalf of’ various plaintiffs,\n              CBP members and class members;\n\n        Like HOME’s board members in Havens Realty,\nCBP’s board members had to attend LMSD’s educational and\ndisciplinary meetings, as well as court hearings, on behalf of\nAfrican-American students. Barbara Metzger, who worked as\na special education teacher at LMSD during the relevant time\nperiod, testified in her deposition that on at least one occasion\nshe “was invited to and sat in on a portion of a Concerned\nBlack Parents’ conversation with some of the school\nadministrators” regarding concerns that “African-American\nstudents, as a whole, . . . were not performing at the same\nrate, not experiencing the same success as other students.” Id.\nat 1456. She also noted that, among other issues, CBP raised\nconcerns that “these students didn’t feel welcome in the\nschool.” Id. CBP engaged in dialogue with LMSD as part of\ntheir advocacy and counseling services for parents whose\nchildren were experiencing discrimination, in an effort to\nraise the concerns at issue in this case.\n\n              [4] Publication of a community newsletter\n              and ‘News Notes . . . to disseminate the\n              compilations of data on’ alleged racial\n              disparities in application of disciplinary\n              measures, segregation by race and ‘under\n              achievement of African-American students\n              in the [Lower Merion] District’;\n\n       CBP published and distributed numerous newsletters\naddressing claims of bias in order to inform parents of\nLMSD’s conduct. For example, in Volume 1, Issue 3 of its\n“Main Line Voice” newsletter, CBP sought “a district-wide\nstrategic plan to close the achievement gap,” citing statistics\nindicating that the same academic excellence that\n“characterizes the LMSD eludes more than sixty percent\n\n\n                                13\n\f(60%) of its African-American students.” Id. at 1494. This\nnewsletter also includes data demonstrating that African-\nAmericans are statistically more likely than their Caucasian\npeers to have IEPs and significantly less likely to be classified\nas gifted. In fact, as I will discuss, for the years that were\nstudied, the probability that an African-American student\nwould be classified as “gifted” or assigned to an Advance\nPlacement class was zero, as none were. Id.8\n\n              [5] The ‘organization’ of educational, career,\n              standardized test, financial aid, and college\n              preparatory seminars.\n\n        Finally, there is ample evidence that CBP advocated\nfor, and provided, college preparation resources that it\nbelieved African-American students needed because of\nLMSD’s purported failure to properly address their needs. In\nher deposition, Ms. Metzger mentioned a meeting she\nattended with school administrators where she raised\nnumerous claims of discrimination on behalf of African-\nAmerican students. CBP “believed that at times, guidance\ncounselors or others, personnel, maybe didn’t afford [African-\nAmerican students] the same consideration when it came to\nthe college planning process.”      Id. at 1456. Ms. Carter\nsimilarly testified that CBP has “met with a number of . . .\ncommunity organizations and institutions that we’ve\nidentified to bring them together” with LMSD, to provide\nsupport to African-American students. Id. at 3406. Thus,\nCBP has demonstrated that it has provided career and college\ncounseling services to the school’s African-American\nstudents to make up for services that it claims LMSD unfairly\nwithheld from these students.\n\n       Judge Greenberg’s analysis suggests that these actions\ndo not establish Article III injuries because “CBP’s very\npurpose relates to actions directly involving LMSD, and its\nexpenditures were devoted to protecting students’ interests in\ntheir interactions with LMSD.” Majority Op. at 64. He\nbelieves this is different from HOME’s injuries in Havens\n\n8\n I will discuss such evidence in detail below in order to\nexplain how the District Court erred in concluding that there\nwas no genuine dispute of material fact. See infra 50-81.\n\n                                14\n\fRealty because “HOME’s purpose was to promote equality in\nthe Richmond area overall and its interests thus went far\nbeyond monitoring the specific actions at issue in the Havens\ncase.” Id. To the extent that I understand that argument, it\nappears to be the classic distinction without a difference.\nCBP would not have had to undertake any of the actions or\nexpenses detailed on this record absent the alleged racial bias\nof LMSD toward African-American students. The fact that\nCBP’s actions are focused on remedying the results of bias\nwithin a school district rather than promoting equality\nthroughout the township of Lower Merion (or Montgomery\nCounty) is absolutely irrelevant. See Majority Op. at 64.\nWhether an organization monitors discrimination in a city or\nsimply a school district does not affect whether it has\nstanding to protect its own interests.9 See Majority Op. at 64-\n65.10\n       Moreover, nothing in this record supports Judge\nGreenberg’s suggestion that CBP’s expenditures relate solely\nto this litigation or that it is thereby trying to manufacture\nstanding through litigation. See Majority Op. at 64\n(“organizations may not satisfy the injury in fact requirement\nby making expenditures solely for the purpose of litigation.”)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n9\n  As noted above, in Powell v. Ridge, this Court held that an\norganizational plaintiff similar to CBP contesting\ndiscrimination in a local school district had personal standing\nto assert its claims. Powell, 189 F.3d at 391, 404. Thus, it is\nincorrect to argue that an organizational plaintiff representing\nthe interests of students in the school district is unable to\nmake a personal standing claim under Havens. Id. (citing to\nHavens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 369); Majority Op. at 64-\n65.\n10\n   Therefore, Judge Greenberg’s observation that “[i]t\nappears that the alleged additional expenditures were\nconsistent with CBP’s typical activities and it is thus unclear\nthe effect, if any, that this litigation had on their\nexpenditures,” Majority Op. at 64, misses the point. CBP’s\nactivities were all focused upon combating the effects of the\nracial bias alleged in LMSD toward African-American\nstudents. The fact that it had to make additional expenditures\nto combat any particular action or to mitigate the impact of\nthe alleged bias is irrelevant to its standing.\n\n                                15\n\f       Judge Greenberg states: “CBP has failed to show why\nthis particular litigation has frustrated its mission, or caused a\n‘concrete and demonstrable’ injury to its activities.” Maj. Op.\nat 64.11 However, that is not the issue. The issue is not\nwhether the litigation has drained CBP’s resources, but\nwhether CBP has had to devote its scarce resources to\ncombating the perceived bias of LMSD and the inferior\neducational opportunities that CBP believes African-\nAmerican students in that school district are afforded.\n\n        Moreover, this record establishes a diminution of\nCBP’s resources irrespective of any subsequent litigation. It\nis abundantly clear that the organization’s goal was not\nsimply to advance litigation against LMSD, but to counteract\nand monitor LMSD’s day-to-day conduct. See, e.g., J.A. at\n3169 (Carter testifying that in 2005-2006, CBP’s expenses\nexceeded its income). The impact on CBP’s scarce resources\nresulted from the organization’s response to the bias it\nbelieved African-American children in LMSD were subjected\nto, not from the litigation that was brought to address it.\nJudge Greenberg’s approach would result in a classic Catch-\n22: nonprofit organizations that had devoted resources and\nincurred expenses to combat a particular activity would\nsomehow lose their standing to sue if they decided that it was\nnecessary to resort to litigation.          Judge Greenberg’s\nobservation that “CBP has failed to show why this particular\nlitigation has frustrated its mission, or caused a ‘concrete and\ndemonstrable’ injury to its activities,” Majority Op. at 64,\ntherefore misses the point of the standing inquiry. The issue\nis not whether this litigation has drained CBP’s resources, but\nwhether CBP’s efforts to combat perceived bias within the\nLMSD has drained CBP’s scarce resources. I do not doubt\nthat the litigation has negatively impacted this nonprofit, but\nthat is neither the beginning nor the end of our inquiry, nor\nshould we focus on that one factor.\n\n        Moreover, even assuming that some of CBP’s\nactivities and expenses were incurred as a result of litigation,\nsummary judgment review requires drawing all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the nonmovant and not against it. Josey\n\n11\n   In addition, far from frustrating CBP’s mission, this\nlitigation is absolutely consistent with that mission.\n\n                                 16\n\fv. John R.

See\nHavens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379 (“[i]f, as broadly alleged,\npetitioners’ steering practices have perceptibly impaired\nHOME’s ability to provide counseling referral services for\nlow - and moderate - income homeseekers, there can be no\nquestion that the organization has suffered injury in fact.”).\nThe evidence supporting CBP’s assertions that it was injured\nby LMSD’s discriminatory conduct distinguishes this case\nfrom Montgomery Newspapers, and suffices to meet the\nstandard for personal standing at the summary judgment\nstage. See Havens Realty, 455 U.S.at 379.12\n\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT APPLIED THE WRONG\n    TEST TO APPELLANTS’ CLAIMS UNDER TITLE\n    VI AND 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n        The District Court applied the wrong test in granting\nLMSD’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims\nunder Title VI and § 1983. As the Majority correctly notes,\nthe appropriate standard for determining liability under Title\nVI is deliberate indifference. I note the following to amplify\nthe Majority’s discussion of the appropriate standard for\nliability under Title VI and § 1983.\n\n12\n   Judge Greenberg cites La Asociacion de Trabajadores de\nLake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (9th\nCir. 2010) (an out of circuit case that is obviously not\nbinding) for the proposition that an organization “must . . .\nshow that it would have suffered some other injury if it had\nnot diverted resources to counteracting the problem” in order\nto demonstrate standing. Majority Op. at 64. However, we\nhave never imposed any such impediment to Article III\nstanding. This additional hurdle is simply contrary to the\nminimal injury required under Article III. See, e.g., Havens\nRealty Corp., 455 U.S. at 377.\n\n                               17\n\f        As the District Court notes, to establish a prima facie\ncase under Title VI, plaintiffs must show that they: (1) were\nmembers of a protected class, (2) were qualified for the\neducational benefit or program at issue, (3) and that they\nsuffered an adverse action, (4) which occurred under\ncircumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\nBlunt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\n       In order to establish a prima facie claim under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs needed to show that their right to be\nfree from racial discrimination, as guaranteed by the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, was\nviolated, and that the violation was committed by a person\nacting under the color of state law. See Chainey v. Street, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444397\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444397/chainey-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n        The District Court concluded that both the § 1983\nclaim and the Title VI claims failed because Plaintiffs were\nunable to show a discriminatory purpose.           The court\ndetermined that Plaintiffs failed to “put forth ‘more than a\nscintilla’ of evidence that the School District acted with a\nracially discriminatory purpose when identifying them as\ndisabled and offering them special education services, even if\nthis identification was somehow incorrect.” Blunt, 826 F.\nSupp. at 764 (quoting Williams v. Borough of West Chester,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1989)).\n\n        According to the District Court, “there was no direct or\ncircumstantial evidence of intentional racial discrimination by\nthe School District,” and this was fatal to Plaintiffs’ claims.\nId at 762. However, the test for “intentional discrimination”\nthat the District Court applied to reach that conclusion is\ninconsistent with decisions of the Supreme Court, our sister\nCircuit Courts of Appeals, and our own precedential opinions.\nIt is also inconsistent with the vast majority of courts that\nhave interpreted the meaning of “discrimination” under\nstatutes that are inextricably linked to, derived from, and\napplicable to provisions of Title VI. This is no minor concern\nbecause we cannot determine if there is sufficient evidence of\nPlaintiffs’ claims to withstand summary judgment unless the\ncorrect test for evaluating this record is first identified and\napplied.\n\n                                18\n\f        In Pryor v.

Rather, we held that, “[in order\nto] prove intentional discrimination by a facially neutral\npolicy, a plaintiff must show that the relevant decisionmaker\n(e.g., a state legislature) adopted the policy at issue ‘because\nof,’ not merely ‘in spite of’ its adverse effects upon an\nidentifiable group.” Id.

Civil Rights Statutes and the “Deliberate Indifference”\nStandard\n\n       In order to avoid any confusion over the applicability\nof the deliberate indifference standard, its application under\nTitle VI here, or the relevance of cases decided under certain\nother statutes, it is helpful to expound on the majority’s\nexplanation of the relationship of Title VI to other civil rights\nstatutes related to it, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Title IX of\nthe Educational Amendments of 1978 (“Title IX”). See\nBarnes v. Gorman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121152\"><a href=\"/opinion/121152/barnes-v-gorman/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185 (2002). Courts often\nlook to the standard that applies under one of these statutes, to\ndecide cases brought under one of the others. Id. The\nSupreme Court, this Court, and nearly all of our sister Courts\nof Appeals that have addressed the standard for establishing\nintentional discrimination under these interrelated civil rights\nstatutes (the RA, ADA, and Title IX) have held that deliberate\nindifference can be sufficient to establish the required\ndiscriminatory intent. Evidence of discriminatory animus is\nnot required.\n\n   a. The Interrelationship of Title VI, The RA, and the\n      ADA.\n\n       As my colleagues note, the RA prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in federally funded\nprograms, including employment programs receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (1998). The\nADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in\nemployment, public accommodations, public entities and\ntransportation, and telecommunications. 42 U.S.C. § 12101\net seq. (2009). As noted above, the RA and ADA are\ncoextensive with Title VI. Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185 (2002);\nS.H. ex. rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (3d Cir. 2013). In Barnes, the Supreme Court\n\n\n                                20\n\fexplained: “the remedies for violations of . . . the ADA and . .\n. the [RA] are coextensive with the remedies available in a\nprivate cause of action brought under Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination in\nfederally funded programs and activities.” 536 U.S. at 185\n(internal citation omitted). In S.H., we explained that:\n       Section 203 of the ADA states that the remedies\n       available under § 202 of the ADA are the same\n       remedies available under § 505 of the RA.\n       Similarly, § 505 of the RA clearly states that the\n       remedies available under § 504 of the RA shall\n       be the same remedies available under Title VI\n       of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n  S.H., 729 F.3d at 260-61.\n\n        Under both the RA and the ADA, “deliberate\nindifference is a form of intentional discrimination . . . .”\nS.H., 729 F.3d at 264 n.24 (emphasis in original) (internal\ncitation omitted). Because the RA itself states that Title VI’s\nrights and remedies should apply, the same deliberate\nindifference standard that applies under the RA should apply\nto claims brought under Title VI.\n\n       “Supreme Court precedent construing Title VI governs\nenforcement of the RA and the ADA as well,” because both\nlaws were modeled on Title VI. S.H., 729 F.3d at 261\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n        When we decided S.H., this was an issue of first\nimpression for us. Id. at 260 (“We have not yet spoken on\nthis issue.”). We therefore took pains to explain our inquiry\ninto “[w]hich standard to apply – discriminatory animus or\ndeliberate indifference. . .”, and we provided a thorough\nexplanation of our decision to adopt the majority rule. We\nexplained that our discussion was (at least in part) in response\nto the Eleventh Circuit’s observation that “despite the\nadoption of the deliberate indifference standard by many of\nour sister courts, ‘there has been little explication for the\nconclusion that intentional discrimination under the RA may\nbe established by deliberate indifference.’” Id. at 263 (quoting\nLiese v.

Title VI and Title IX.\n\n       Fewer than ten years after Title VI was passed,\nCongress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n1972 (“Title IX”) to protect against gender-based\ndiscrimination in federally funded educational programs. 20\nU.S.C. § 1681 (2014) (“No person in the United States shall,\non the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance.”). Congress explicitly modeled Title IX on Title\nVI. “Except for the substitution of the word ‘sex’ in Title IX\nto replace the words ‘race, color, or national origin’ in Title\nVI, the two statutes use identical language to describe the\nbenefited class.” Cannon v.

Davis, 526 U.S. at 632-33. The harassed student\n(LaShonda) and her family reported the harassing student’s\nconduct to various school officials, including her teachers and\nthe principal. Id. at 634. The harassing student was\neventually charged with, and pled guilty to, sexual battery for\nharassing LaShonda and others. Id. In the suit that followed,\nthe plaintiffs alleged that, despite the fact that the student pled\n\n                                 22\n\fguilty, the school took no disciplinary action in response to\nLaShonda’s repeated complaints, and it failed to make any\neffort to protect LaShonda by separating her from the\nharassing student. Id. at 635. The defendants argued that\nplaintiffs needed to demonstrate that the defendants\nthemselves had actually harassed LaShonda, not simply that\nthey had ignored her harassment at the hands of another\nstudent. Id. at 636. The Supreme Court relied on Gebser,\nand held that the school board could itself be liable for sexual\nharassment under Title IX if it was deliberately indifferent to\nthe peer-on-peer sexual harassment. Id. at 641-43 (“Gebser\nthus established that a recipient intentionally violates Title IX,\nand is subject to a private damages action, where the recipient\nis deliberately indifferent to known acts of teacher-student\ndiscrimination.”) (internal citations omitted)(emphasis\nadded).\n\n        The rational for allowing deliberate indifference to\nestablish intentional discrimination under Title VI is further\nillustrated by limitations and obligations arising from the\nSending Clause authority that each of the analogous statutes\nis based upon.\n\nc. The Relevance of the Spending Clause\n\n       Title VI, Title IX, the RA and the ADA are all based\non the same exercise of congressional power under the\nSpending Clause. U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1. Guardians\nAss’n, 463 U.S. at 598-99 (1983) (opinion of White, J.)(Title\nVI); Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287 (Title IX); S.H., 729 F.3d at 264\n(RA and ADA).\n\n       In Gebser, the Supreme Court explained how the\nsource of congressional authority in enacting Title IX and\nTitle VI informed interpretation of the statutes:\n\n       Title IX's contractual nature has implications for our\n       construction of the scope of available remedies. When\n       Congress attaches conditions to the award of federal\n       funds under its spending power, U.S. Const., Art. I, §\n       8, cl. 1, as it has in Title IX and Title VI, we examine\n       closely the propriety of private actions holding the\n       recipient liable in monetary damages for\n\n                                 23\n\f       noncompliance with the condition. Our central concern\n       in that regard is with ensuring that “the receiving entity\n       of federal funds [has] notice that it will be liable for a\n       monetary award.”\n\nGebser, 524 U.S. at 287-88 (emphasis added) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\nIn S.H. we explained:\n\n       [t]he RA and ADA were enacted under\n       Congress’s Spending Clause power; legislation\n       that is enacted under this power ‘is much in the\n       nature of a contract’ between the federal\n       government and recipients of federal funds” and\n       “[t]he Supreme Court has thus reasoned that a\n       recipient of federal funding, such as the School\n       District here, may be held liable for money\n       damages only when it is on notice by statute\n       that it has violated the law.”).\n\n729 F.3d at 264 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Under the Spending Clause analysis of S.H., animus is\nnot a condition precedent to a contractual breach. Rather,\nintent to breach can be assumed from knowledge of a set of\ncircumstances, and a refusal to remedy them. This is true\nwhether the law in question prohibits gender-based\ndiscrimination under Title IX, disability-based discrimination\nunder the ADA or RA, or racial discrimination as is alleged\nhere under Title VI.\n\n2. The District Court’s Approach is Inconsistent with the\nDecision of Every Other Circuit Court That Has Decided\nThis Issue\n\n       Every Circuit Court of Appeals that has addressed this\nissue has held that the heightened discriminatory animus\nstandard does not apply to Title VI claims. 14 See Bryant v.\n\n14\n   In S.H., we identified two Courts of Appeals that appeared\nto adopt a minority position.

Bryant, 334 F.3d at 934. Plaintiffs there were students\nwho alleged that they were subject to a racially hostile school\nenvironment. Id. at 931. The relevant school officials were\n“aware of the racial slurs, graffiti inscribed in school\nfurniture, and notes placed in students’ lockers and\nnotebooks” and yet, “[t]he principal affirmatively chose to\ntake no action.” Id. at 932-33.         While noting that the\noffending conduct must be intentional to pass muster under\nTitle VI, the Tenth Circuit explained: “[c]hoice implicates\nintent” lest “school administrators . . . sit idly, or\nintentionally, by while horrible acts of discrimination\noccurred on their grounds by and to students in their charge.”\nId. at 933. The court added: “when administrators who have\na duty to provide a nondiscriminatory educational\n\nand the Fifth Circuit in Delano-Pyle v.

However, neither decision\nactually adopts a “minority rule.” Nieves-Marquez never\nrejected the “deliberate indifference” standard as a form of\nintentional discrimination. Similarly, in Delano-Pyle, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not affirmatively\nrequire discriminatory animus to establish intentional\ndiscrimination under the RA and ADA. Instead, the court\naffirmed the jury’s verdict based on intentional\ndiscrimination.\n\n                               25\n\fenvironment for their charges are made aware of egregious\nforms of intentional discrimination and make the intentional\nchoice to sit by and do nothing, they can be held liable” under\nTitle VI. Id.\n\n       The court instructed the district court on remand:\n       to apply the test from Davis v. Monroe County\n       Board of Education” to a Title VI hostile\n       school environment claim because “Congress\n       based Title IX on Title VI; therefore, the\n       Court’s analysis of what constitutes intentional\n       sexual discrimination under Title IX directly\n       informs our analysis of what constitutes\n       intentional racial discrimination under Title VI\n       (and vice versa).\n\n Id. at 934. We should remand and do the same here.\n\n       The Plaintiffs here may not be able to ultimately\nconvince a fact finder that they should prevail under Title VI\nor § 1983, but they have clearly produced sufficient evidence\nto survive summary judgment, and they are clearly entitled to\nhave the correct legal standard of deliberate indifference\napplied to their proof.\n\nIII. THIS RECORD AND SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       My colleagues readily concede the difficulty of\nproving a discriminatory motive and the concomitant\nnecessity of allowing plaintiffs to rely solely on\ncircumstantial evidence. See Majority Op. at 45 (“individuals\nwho violate the law based on discriminatory motives\nsometimes do not leave a trail of direct evidence, but instead\n‘cover their tracks’ by providing alternate explanations for\ntheir actions.”). We have discussed this in some detail in the\ncontext of claims of job discrimination. In Aman v. Cort\nFurniture, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719617\"><a href=\"/opinion/719617/carol-aman-jeanette-johnson-v-cort-furniture-rental-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1082 (3d Cir. 1996), we stated:\n“defendants of even minimal sophistication will neither admit\ndiscriminatory animus nor leave a paper trail demonstrating\nit.” This is especially true since those who harbor conscious\n(as opposed to subliminal) bias may attempt to “cover their\ntracks[.]” Majority Op. at 45.\n\n\n\n                               26\n\f       Thus, bias will sometimes manifest itself only in subtle\nways that the actor him/herself may not even be cognizant of.\nIn Cort Furniture, we explained that “Discrimination\ncontinues to pollute the social and economic mainstream of\nAmerican life, and is often simply masked in more subtle\nforms.” 95 F.3d at 1082. In Coombs v 616 F.3d, 264, in\ndiscussing the possible unconscious bias of a prosecutor in\nstriking Black jurors we explained, “[l]ike anyone else, trial\nattorneys possess those human frailties that make each of us\nfar too susceptible to social conditioning and the subliminal\nbias that may result.” Surely, teachers in our public schools,\neven though they may not be acting out of racial animus or\nconscious bias, are no less human, and no more immune to\nthe “frailties that make each of us far too susceptible to social\nconditioning and the subliminal bias that may result,” than\nattorneys are.\n\n        This does not eliminate the Plaintiffs’ need to produce\nenough evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment.\nHowever, the nature of the fact to be proven must inform a\ncourt’s analysis of the evidence that is produced. If Plaintiffs\nhave produced enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to Defendants’ deliberate indifference,\nPlaintiffs are entitled to their day in court on their Title VI\nand § 1983 claims whether the deliberate indifference is\nborne of deliberate animus or the more insidious poison of\nsocial conditioning. 15 Here, plaintiffs’ proof is more than\nsufficient to establish a genuine dispute of material fact,\nespecially if we consider the ephemeral nature of the racially\ncaused deliberate indifference they must prove.\n\nA. The Summary Judgment Standard Has Been Ignored\n\n\n\n15\n  For an interesting discussion of the neurological science\nunderlying the subtleties of bias that we discussed in Cort\nFurniture and Coombs, see John A.

Blunt, 826 F.Supp.2d at 760. Yet, the court\ndismissively refused to admit it based upon the court’s belief\nthat “there must be some evidence that irregularities were\nrelated to plaintiffs’ race.” Id. Thus, the Plaintiffs were\ndenied the benefit of all reasonable inferences in defending\nagainst summary judgment and they were also expected to\nprove a negative by dispelling all causes for the “procedural\nirregularities” other than race.\n\n        After demanding that Plaintiffs prove the irregularities\nhere were tied to race - irregularities that my colleagues\nignore, the District Court not only failed to afford the\nPlaintiffs the inference demanded by summary judgment, the\ncourt ignored evidence that was relevant to the very racial\nnexus the court demanded proof of.\n\n       As I will explain below, the Plaintiffs’ expert\nexamined the extent to which African-American students are\noverrepresented in LMSD’s special education classes while\nbeing completely absent from any “high expectation” college\nprep or advanced placement classes, and concluded both as a\nmatter of statistical science as well as common sense that\nthose numbers indicate “there is something systematic about\n\n                                28\n\fthe LMSD practices related to Ethnicity.” J.A. at 1676\n(emphasis added). There is other evidence, that I will discuss,\nthat is easily sufficient to create a genuine dispute of material\nfact if the record is properly viewed in its totality.\n\n        Any appropriately flexible inquiry, if guided by the\ncorrect legal test of deliberate indifference, would have\nrealized the potential for a fact finder to conclude that\nPlaintiffs have met their burden based on all of the\ncircumstantial evidence here. I reiterate: at this point, the\nburden is merely to produce sufficient evidence that there is a\ngenuine dispute of material fact. Plaintiffs do not have to\nprove their case to survive summary judgment, and they are\nentitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\n\n       Circumstantial evidence (which all involved concede\nis not only permissible but necessary in such cases) is\nnothing more than a fact derived from an inference drawn\nfrom proof of underlying circumstances. See Black’s Law\nDictionary 18c (9th ed. 2009). That is exactly what we have\nhere. Although I do not suggest that this record would\nnecessarily result in a reasonable fact finder inferring a racial\nmotive based on deliberate indifference, such a finding would\nclearly be supported by this record, even absent the\nevidentiary equivalent of a “smoking gun.”\n\n       I am thus at a complete loss to understand how the\nDistrict Court could have looked at this record and concluded\nthat Plaintiffs had “not put forth more than a scintilla of\nevidence that the LMSD had acted with a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose [i.e. deliberate indifference] in\nidentifying them as disabled and placing them in special\neducation courses . . . .” See Majority Op. at 86.\n\n        Although we are assured that plaintiffs in cases such\nas this need not produce the proverbial “smoking gun,” it\ncertainly appears that after today, they will be required to\nproduce something akin to evidence of either a muzzle flash\nor a surveillance video in order to survive summary\njudgment.\n\n       In affirming this grant of summary judgment, my\ncolleagues note that there “was no evidence presented in the\n\n                                29\n\fDistrict Court that the LMSD applied different evaluation\nprocedures for determining placement of African-American\nstudents than for Caucasian students.” Majority Op. at 93.\nThere does not have to be.16\n\n        There is an expert’s conclusion that there is\nstatistically significant evidence of African American being\ndisproportionately assigned to special education classes while\nnone are enrolled in advanced placement or “high expectation\nclasses.” We know that the African-American students who\nare plaintiffs here were placed in special education classes\neven though their tests did not indicate such a placement was\nwarranted and/or that deficiencies were relied on for such\nplacements that did not justify a special education\nplacement.17 This is evidence that was dismissed, even\nthough we should be mindful of the difficulties of proof in\nsuch cases and that bias is no longer “worn on sleeves” or\n“carried on signs.”\n\n        Moreover, as I have already explained, no evidence of\ndifferent testing or separate evaluation procedures is required.\nAlthough such evidence would certainly have advanced the\nPlaintiffs’ claim of racial bias, its absence is far from fatal to\nthose claims given the other evidence on this record.\n\n16\n   A relevant article from the highly respected periodical\nmentioned above (n.15) contains a helpful illustration of why\nmy colleagues’ approach to claims of bias is both misguided\nand naivè: “A college admissions officer might zero in on a\nless than stellar grade in an otherwise solid medical school\napplication from a prospective minority student without\nrealizing those same negative features are not weighted so\nheavily for the other applicants.” Bargh supra note 16 at 34.\nAs I discuss below, it appears here that African-American\nstudents may well have been placed in special education\nclasses based on evaluations that did not warrant such a\nplacement. It is therefore irrelevant that the same evaluations\nwere used to place White students in special education\nclasses.\n17\n   And this does not even include evidence that should have\nbeen admitted but was erroneously labeled “hearsay,” or\ncould not survive an overly rigorous authentication\nrequirement.\n\n                                 30\n\fWhether or not the procedural irregularities in the erroneous\nand improper placement of these African-American students\nin special education classes was the result of bias (i.e.\ndeliberate indifference), ineptitude, or coincidence should not\nbe decided on summary judgment given the Plaintiffs’\nevidence.\n\n        My colleagues acknowledge that “plaintiffs’ expert, a\npsychologist [concluded] that five or six of the students in\nquestion incorrectly had been identified as learning disabled. .\n.” Majority Op. at 93. Yet they attach no evidentiary\nsignificance to the fact that nearly every individual African-\nAmerican student in this suit was improperly placed in special\neducation classes, because that expert opinion “was not\nrendered until these proceedings were pending in the District\nCourt . . . .” Majority Op. at 93. I do not understand how that\nbears on whether the Plaintiffs submitted sufficient evidence\nto survive summary judgment in the District Court, and the\nabsence of legal citation or explanation of why this is the least\nbit relevant does not encourage comfort in such a strange\nprinciple. Indeed, I have no idea why one would go to the\ntrouble and expense of obtaining an expert opinion about\nalleged improprieties before the evidence was required as\nproof in a judicial proceeding. The expert opinion was before\nthe District Court when it ruled on the Defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. 18\n\n       Although the abuse of discretion standard that governs\nour review of the District Court’s evidentiary rulings is quite\ndeferential, it is not insurmountable and focusing on the\ndeference properly afforded an evidentiary ruling ought not to\nsubstitute for an objective analysis of whether the ruling was\nan abuse of discretion.\n\n     Thus, even if it was proper to ignore the MAP\nPowerPoint and all of Dr. Moore-Williams’ testimony (and it\nwas not), which I discuss in detail below, the remaining\n\n18\n  The District Court never even mentioned the fact that the\nrecord contained evidence that the level of disproportionality\nwas statistically significant, and that it showed “there is\nsomething systematic about the LMSD practices related to\nEthnicity.” J.A. at 1676.\n\n                                31\n\frecord should still have precluded summary judgment. “The\ntotality of the evidence . . . must guide our analysis rather\nthan the strength of each individual argument.” Bray v.\nMarriott Hotels, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739304\"><a href=\"/opinion/739304/73-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1163-70-empl-prac-dec-p-44755-beryl-bray/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (3d Cir. 1997).

Although that is true, recitation\nof that general principle does not justify adopting a wholly\ndismissive attitude toward the evidence of disproportionally\nin the LMSD, or considering it in isolation from other\nevidence.\n\n       For the five-year span captured by these numbers, the\npercentage of Caucasian students in special education classes\nin LMSD was roughly equivalent to, though always less than,\nthe total percentage of Caucasian students in the LMSD\nstudent body. For most of that time frame, the percentage of\nAfrican-American students enrolled in special education\nclasses in LMSD was twice the percentage of the number of\nAfrican-Americans in the student body. These percentages\ndo not exist in a vacuum.\n\n1. Plaintiffs’ Expert Dr. Conroy Placed the Statistical\nEvidence in Context\n\n        Plaintiffs produced the testimony of an expert witness,\nDr. James W. Conroy, Ph.D, who studied enrollment and\nstudent placement in the various courses at LMSD.19 He\nfound that, while African-American students were greatly\noverrepresented in “low expectation” classes, they were\ndramatically underrepresented in more demanding college\npreparatory and advanced placement courses. J.A. at 1671-\n74. “The pattern is that these courses with the highest\nproportions of Black students tend strongly to be courses that\nI would label as ‘low expectations’ courses.” Id., at 1673-74\n(italics added).\n\n      Conroy also examined the racial composition of the\ntwelve advanced or “high expectation” classes. He found that\n\n19\n   Although it is not necessary to note Conroy’s\nqualifications at this stage, it is important to consider that it\nincludes “39 years of research in disability, education, and\nhealth issues among children and adults,” and since\ngraduating Cum Laude, from Yale and earning his Ph.D. in\nMedical Sociology from Temple University, “With\nDistinction,” he has qualified as an expert in disability\nresearch, disability policy, special education and statistical\nanalysis. J.A. at 1670.\n\n                                  33\n\fin 2008, not only were African-American students\nunderrepresented in those classes; the percentage of African-\nAmerican students in “high expectation” classes was “zero.”\nId. at 1674-75 (emphasis in original). In other words, not a\nsingle African-American student was assigned to any of the\ntwelve high expectation classes in LMSD in 2008.20 Id. Lest\none think 2008 was a fluke or a statistical aberration, Conroy\nfound exactly the same pattern “for each of the years 2005,\n2006, 2007, and 2008.” Id. at 1675. For each of those years\nnot a single African-American student was assigned to a\ncollege prep or “high expectation” class in this school district.\n\n        Conroy testified that the extent of this disparity was\n“‘significant’ in the statistical sense.” Id. at 1676. In fact,\nConroy concluded that the disproportionally in LMSD was so\nevident that one need not be an expert in statistics to grasp its\nsignificance. Rather, he believed that “[t]he Lower Merion\npopulation data may be judged practically significant by\nsimple observation of large differences in the kinds of courses\nstudents [sic] Black and Others students wind up in.” Id. at\n1677 (emphasis in original). His conclusion, rejected by the\nDistrict Court as a matter of law, was that: “there is\nsomething systematic about the LMSD practices related to\nEthnicity.” Id. at 1676 (emphasis in original).\n\n        The Majority states that “[t]he District Court . . .\ndiscussed in detail the statistical data that the plaintiffs put\nforward.” Majority Op. at 92. Yet, both my colleagues and\nthe District Court ignore that absolutely no African-American\nstudents were placed in “high expectation” classes during the\nperiod examined by Conroy, and the Majority fails to note\nthat the District Court ignored the expert conclusion that\nLMSD employed these “practices related to Ethnicity.”\nHowever, even if the statistics could properly be viewed in\nisolation, the issue remains not whether those disparities\nestablish deliberate indifference, but whether they create an\nissue of fact about African-American students’ placement in\n\n20\n  Those classes included: Latin 3H, AP Calculus BC, IB\nSenior Project, IB Theory of Knowledge, Economics H, IB\nHistory of Americas HL 2, IB English A1 HL (Part 2), Art 2\nH, AP Spanish Language, AP Physics C Electromagnetism,\nand Organic Chemistry H.

[and they] must be sufficiently\n       substantial that they raise an inference of\n       causation.\n\nMajority Op. at 47 (quoting Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &\nTrust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112145\"><a href=\"/opinion/112145/watson-v-fort-worth-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996 (1988).\n\n       There are other problems with the Majority’s attempt\nto ignore the force of the statistical evidence. First, in\nWatson, the Court was deciding whether a statistically based\ndisparate impact analysis was applicable to a claim of\ndisparate treatment in a “subjective or discretionary\npromotion system.” 487 U.S. at 999. The Court said nothing\nthat would assist us in determining the propriety of a sample\nsize or the probative force of the “deviation” here. Indeed,\nthe Court’s only mention of “deviation” was the following\nreference in a footnote:\n\n        Courts have also referred to the ‘standard deviation’\nanalysis sometimes used in jury selection cases. We have\nemphasized the useful role that statistical methods can have in\nTitle VII cases, but we have not suggested that any particular\nnumber of ‘standard deviations’ can determine whether a\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case in the complex area\nof employment discrimination.\n\nId. at 995 n.3 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                 35\n\f        The Majority seems concerned with the sample size\nhere as well as the significance of the deviation. They cite to\nWatson, stating: “the Supreme Court has explained that\nneither the ‘courts nor defendants [are] obliged to assume that\nplaintiffs’ statistical evidence is reliable,’ and has cited, for\nexample, the weaknesses inherent in small or incomplete data\nsets and/or inadequate statistical techniques.” Majority Op. at\n46 (internal citation omitted). That is clearly true as a general\nproposition, but I do not understand how that general\nproposition advances our inquiry. There is nothing on this\nrecord to suggest that the Plaintiffs’ experts’ statistical\nanalysis is flawed, that the data set is “incomplete and/or\ninadequate,” or that their experts’ statistical techniques are\nflawed. The District Court made no such finding and it\nappears that LMSD did not make any such argument to the\ndistrict court.\n\n       The issue in Watson was whether a disparate impact\nanalysis could be used to establish disparate treatment in an\nemployment discrimination suit involving a discretionary\npromotion system at a bank having 80 employees – far fewer\nthan the numbers involved here.           There, the African-\nAmerican plaintiff had attempted to use statistical evidence of\nthe paucity of African-Americans who had been promoted at\nthe bank, in order to establish her disparate treatment claim\nthat the bank had failed to promote her because of her race.\nThe Supreme Court held that statistical evidence of disparate\nimpact could be used to establish a prima facie case of\ndisparate treatment but rejected the position of some courts\nthat looked to EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employment\nSelection Procedures.        Those courts had “adopted an\nenforcement rule under which adverse impact” would “not\nordinarily be inferred unless the members of a particular . . .\ngroup [were] selected at a rate that [was] less than four-fifths\nof the rate at which the group with the highest rate [was]\nselected.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 995 n.3. The Court restated\nthe “useful role that statistical methods can have in Title VII\ncases,” but cautioned that it had “not suggested that any\nparticular number of ‘standard deviations’ can determine\nwhether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case . . ..” Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                36\n\f        The situation here is remarkably different. In order to\nestablish deliberate indifference under the theory advanced\nhere, Plaintiffs had to first establish that African-American\nstudents were being placed in “low expectation” classes at a\nsignificantly disproportionate rate to Caucasian students.\nEven my colleagues seem to concede that the record\nestablishes that, and LMSD does not really deny that. Any\ndispute about statistical sampling, standard deviations, and “z\nscores,” is beside the point.\n\n2. There are Issues Regarding Defendants’ Expert’s\nMethodology\n\n        Plaintiffs’ expert explained his methodology in great\ndetail and we have only my colleagues’ countervailing\nimplied mastery of statistics to dismiss the statistical validity\nof Plaintiffs’ expert’s conclusions. My colleagues’ concern\nabout such statistical terms of art as: “data sets” and\n“statistical techniques” and sample size, is even more\npuzzling when one considers that the Defendants’ expert, Dr.\nDaniel Reschly, reached a conclusion that was contrary to\nPlaintiffs’ expert based on a much smaller sample size.\nReschly only looked at two years of student placements as\nopposed to the five years that Conroy used to reach a\nconclusion about the role of race in LMSD’s placements.\nMoreover, Reschly admitted that his inquiry was hurried and\nthat he did not request additional information required to\nperform the kind of analysis he would otherwise have\nconducted because there was insufficient time. J.A. at 2979.\nId. at 2590.\n\n        Although I do not address the Majority’s rejection of\nPlaintiffs’ appeal of the District Court’s decision to consider\nReschly’s evidence without subjecting it to a Daubert\nhearing, I neither agree with that decision, nor do I\nunderstand why the District Court denied the requested\nDaubert hearing. I do not discuss it in detail because that\nruling has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs offered enough\nevidence to survive summary judgment. If Reschly’s report\ncould withstand a Daubert inquiry, we have a classic battle of\nthe experts that a jury should resolve. If it is not admitted\nunder Daubert, the record still contains a factual issue that\nmust be decided by a jury.\n\n                                37\n\f        I do note that my colleagues misstate the Plaintiffs’\nbasis for challenging the District Court’s denial of their\nrequest for a Daubert hearing. My colleagues suggest that\nPlaintiffs’ objection to Reschly’s report “lies with one\nparagraph.” Majority Op. at 84. That is the District Court’s\nacceptance of Reschly’s definition of “disproportionality.”\nMy colleagues explain their rejection of this claim as follows:\n“[w]e find this use of Reschly’s wording to define\ndisproportionality to be immaterial to the outcome of this\nlitigation.” Id.\n\n        However, there are many more issues with Reschly’s\nreport than the definition of “disproportonality,” and these are\nset forth in the Memorandum of Law filed in support of\nPlaintiffs’ Daubert Motion to Partially Exclude and/or Limit\nthe Report and Testimony of Daniel J. Reschly, Ph.D. J.A. at\n2916. Arguably, there are numerous problems with Reschly’s\nreport, including the fact that he admitted that he did not have\nenough time to conduct the kind of comparison he otherwise\nwould have, the files he compared were selected by agents of\nLMSD, and he only compared two years of class assignments.\n\n       The issue for us is not, of course, which expert is\ncorrect. Rather we should only be concerned with whether\nthis disagreement raises a genuine dispute of material fact.\nThe majority does not believe it does because my colleagues\nsimply reject the statistical evidence supporting the Plaintiffs’\nclaim of bias. That is improper.

In Teamsters, the\ndefendant employer argued that “statistics can never in and of\nthemselves prove the existence of a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination, or even establish a prima facie case shifting to\nthe employer the burden of rebutting the inference raised by\nthe figures.” 431 U.S. at 338. The Court rejected the\n\n                                38\n\fdefendant’s attempt to minimize the importance of statistical\nanalysis by explaining: “our cases make it unmistakably clear\nthat ‘[s]tatistical analyses have served and will continue to\nserve an important role’ in cases in which the existence of\ndiscrimination is a disputed issue.” 431 U.S. at 338, (brackets\nin original). This is such a case.\n\n        Moreover, the invocation of the maxim that statistics\ncannot “by themselves” establish discriminatory intent,\nshould not obscure the fact that there is “more,” on this\nrecord. There is much more. Thus, even if the opinion of the\nPlaintiffs’ expert could not, by itself, raise an issue of fact, it\nis neither proper nor fair to discuss Plaintiffs’ proof as if they\nwere only relying on that evidence to establish an issue of fact\nabout discriminatory intent under the deliberate indifference\nstandard.\n\nC. Evidence of a “MAP” Program was Improperly\nExcluded and Raises a Dispute of Fact.\n\n        Before discussing the MAP evidence, it is helpful to\nreiterate the nature of the disputed factual issues in this case.\nAs my colleagues readily concede, proof of intent can rarely\nbe achieved by direct evidence. See Majority Op. at 45.\nAccordingly, as noted earlier, “[c]ourts today must be\nincreasingly vigilant in their efforts to ensure that prohibited\ndiscrimination is not approved under the auspices of\nlegitimate conduct, and a plaintiff’s ability, to prove\ndiscrimination [i.e. deliberate indifference rising to the level\nof discriminatory intent] indirectly, circumstantially, must not\nbe crippled . . . because of crabbed notions of relevance or\nexcessive mistrust of juries.” Cort Furniture, 85 F.3d at 1082\n(internal quotation marks omitted, ellipsis in original).\n\n       Moreover, the practical problems of proof in cases\nsuch as this counsel in favor of the same kind of practical\nassessment of proof that the courts have adopted pursuant to\nthe Supreme Court’s McDonnell Douglas burden shifting\nanalysis.

The District Court\nacknowledged the flexible nature of the proof required to\nestablish a prima facie case.

Yet,\nthe court’s inquiry was inconsistent with the flexible\napproach the court acknowledged it must adopt.\n\n        With respect to the MAP presentation and the\nattendant authentication testimony from Dr. Barbara Moore-\nWilliams, the District Court and the Majority commit\ndifferent errors. The District Court abused its discretion by\nfailing to admit the MAP presentation because it held that the\ndocument was improperly authenticated under Federal Rule\nof Evidence 901(a). On the other hand, the Majority\nostensibly does not contest the admissibility of the document\nand instead simply holds that it is insufficient to demonstrate\nthat the LMSD intentionally discriminated against plaintiffs.\nSuch a position is problematic because it places an improper\nburden on the Plaintiffs, and again transgresses into fact-\nfinding.      The MAP testimony is admissible and\nadmissibility—not probative weight, is the focus of a\nsummary judgment inquiry.\n\n       As an initial matter, it is important to understand what\nthe MAP presentation is. During discovery, LMSD disclosed\na PowerPoint presentation entitled “Minority Achievement\nProgram” (MAP) on LMSD letterhead dated October 2010\nthat the District Court deemed inadmissible because it was\nnot properly authenticated. That was an abuse of discretion\nthat had a very significant impact on this litigation, and threw\none more obstacle in the path of having a jury determine the\nvalidity of Plaintiffs’ allegations against this school district.\n\n       The MAP “document lists alleged characteristics of\nAfrican-American students, including a preference for ‘tactile\nlearning’ and ‘[s]ubdued lighting’ that they ‘[r]ely heavily on\nvisual input rather than auditory input,’ and that they ‘[r]eact\nintensely to being praised or criticized.’” Blunt, 826\nF.Supp.2d at 761 (brackets in original). The District Court\nrefused to consider the contents of the brochure because “the\nrecord does not reveal who created this document or under\nwhat circumstances and what position the creator or creators\noccupied within the School District. There is no evidence\nthat the purported presentation was ever used.” Id. The\n\n                                40\n\fmajority agrees with the District Court that the fundamental\nproblem with admitting the MAP testimony is the lack of\nevidence that it was used, noting that it “assume[s] the\ncontention that this presentation, if used by LMSD, would\nprovide evidence of discriminatory intent, or deliberate\nindifference to a third party’s discriminatory intent.”\nMajority Op. at 82.\n\n        Dr. Barbara Moore-Williams, Ed. D. is an educational\nconsultant retained by LMSD to assist LMSD in addressing\nissues of racial disparity in educational placements. She was\nretained by LMSD’s Assistant Principal after he saw her give\na presentation at a consortium of area schools. J.A. at 1410.\nHer presentation addressed the issue of “cultural proficiency”\nand educational success “as a national issue.” Id. at 1411.\nAccording to Moore-Williams, the Assistant Principal was\napparently interested in retaining her because he thought her\nwork and information would be helpful to LMSD. Id. at\n1410. Her work focused on “cultural proficiency among staff\nthat teach children who are not their culture, their race, their\nethnicity, and the need to pay attention to African-American\nmales who are struggling in America to get an education . . .\n.” Id.\n\n       The District Court refused to consider the entirety of\nDr. Moore-Williams’s testimony that LMSD “discriminated\nagainst African-Americans” because she also testified that\n“there is racism in all school districts and that Lower Merion\nSchool District’s problems are no different from any other\nsuburban school district.” Blunt, 828 F.Supp.2d at 761.21\nThe District Court thought that Dr. Moore-Williams’\ntestimony was little more than her “personal belief and\nhearsay statements of others.” Id. The District Court\nconcluded that for these reasons, “her statements cannot\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact regarding the School\nDistrict’s intent to discriminate.” Id. My colleagues agree.\n\n21\n   When asked directly whether, based on her experience and\nconversations with LMSD personnel regarding prejudice in\nthe teaching staff, there was any prejudice in the teaching\nstaff, she stated that “[b]ased on [her] experience, there’s\nprejudice in everybody. So, yes, there’s prejudice in the\nLower Merion School District.” J.A. at 1412.\n\n                               41\n\fMajority Op. at 89-90. Regardless, parts of her testimony\nwere nevertheless admissible for the purpose of shedding\nlight on the MAP PowerPoint.\n\n       As I have just noted, that PowerPoint purported to list\nseveral things that were characteristic of the way African-\nAmerican students learn. It stated in part:\n\n      “Many African-American students prefer:\n\n                    more kinesthetic/tactile learning.\n                    subdued lighting rather than bright light.\n                    rely heavily on visual input rather than\n                    auditory input.\n                    respond to cooperative learning.\n                    simultaneous talk instead of alternating\n                    talk.\n                    to study while music or conversation\n                    occurs in the room..\n                    outer-directed rather than egocentric\n                    focus.\n                    more active environments v. sedentary\n                    learning environments of American\n                    Schools.\n                    rely more on information from their\n                    surroundings.\n\nJ.A. at 1838. During her deposition, Moore-Williams was\nasked if she had “ever heard a teacher or a staff member from\nLower Merion School District discuss the use of visual input\nrather than auditory input in their classrooms.” Id. at 1414.\nShe affirmed that she had. Id. She was then asked about each\nof the items listed in the MAP PowerPoint. Id. Counsel\nreferred to them by their place on the list. Id. Although she\nhad not heard teachers refer to each of the bullet points, she\nhad heard teachers refer to some of them. Id. The following\nexchange occurred as counsel took Moore-Williams through\nthe PowerPoint:\n       Q. [W]ith regard to the fourth bullet point concerning\nhighly cooperative learning?\n       A.. Yes.\n       Q. That has been implemented?\n       A. Yes.\n\n                               42\n\f        Q. And has the fifth bullet point concerning\nsimultaneous talk instead alternating      talk           been\nimplemented in Lower Merion School District?\n        A. Yes.\n        Q. And what about the use of music of conversation in\nthe room while studying?\n        A. I haven’t heard.\n        Q. And that was the sixth bullet point. Now, what\nabout the seventh bullet point     concerning the        outer-\ndirected rather than egocentric focus?\n        A. No.\n        Q. And what about the eighth bullet point concerning,\nI believe you said, more active        environments      versus\nsedentary learning environments.?\n        A. Yes.\n        Q. And how have teachers described . . . active\nenvironments versus sedentary      learning environments with\nAfrican-American students in the district?\n        A. Kind of along with cooperative learning, because\ncooperative learning is active.    So it’s in conjunction with,\nwe need to do more things where the kids are up and about\nand interacting with each other.22\nId. at 1414.\n\n        Although Moore-Williams could not corroborate that\nthe MAP PowerPoint presentation had been used in its\nentirety, the District Court abused its discretion by so\nfocusing on the generalities of her beliefs about the extent to\nwhich all public schools are infected with some degree of\nracism that it overlooked the fact that her testimony was\nrelevant to establishing the very fact the District Court found\nlacking - that teachers had adopted the MAP PowerPoint (at\nleast in part).\n\n       My colleagues conclude that because “Dr. Moore-\nWilliams did not testify about the MAP presentation itself,” it\nnecessarily follows that her testimony “does not establish\nwho prepared the presentation, or whether LMSD ever used it\nor for what purpose.” Majority Op. at 83. The conclusion\n\n22\n  “Cooperative learning” is the 14th bullet point on the MAP\nPowerPoint: “Function better under cooperative conditions.”\nJ.A. at 1838.\n\n                               43\n\ffails to consider the detail with which Moore-Williams\nreferred to the presentation.\n\n        More importantly, it does not refute the admissibility\nof the testimony or the presentation. While the District Court\ndisputed the authenticity of the presentation, the Majority\ndoes not identify any such failure to meet the requirements of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 901(a). Perhaps this is because\nauthentication under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a) is an\nincredibly “slight” burden, which may be satisfied by simply\nproducing “evidence sufficient to support a finding that the\nitem is what the proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 901(a).\n\n       My colleagues concede that Moore-Williams\n“indicated that she heard of certain bullet points,” but they\nargue that “she noted that they were not related to African-\nAmerican students. At most, her testimony is relevant to the\nextent that she heard from LMSD personnel that they used\ndifferent teaching strategies for particular students.” Majority\nOp. at 83. My colleagues then dismiss the probative value of\nMoore-Williams’ testimony because she did not testify that\nshe heard teachers specifically connect the MAP strategies to\nAfrican-American students. However, the portion of the\nMAP document quoted above begins with the statement:\n“Many African-American students prefer . . .”. The fact that\nMoore-Williams did not hear teachers mention African-\nAmerican students when discussing the unique learning styles\nsuggested in the MAP presentation is clearly fodder for\ndefense counsel’s closing argument at trial. It is not a reason\nto ignore the existence of a disputed fact. While Moore-\nWilliams’ testimony need only place relevant “dots” into\nevidence, Plaintiffs should be able to rely on the resulting\ninferences to connect them. They should not, however, have\nto explicitly connect all of the dots, color in the resulting\nimage, and frame the picture to survive summary judgment.\nThere is enough on the record to support an inference that the\ndistinct teaching approaches were aimed at African-American\nstudents given the language of the MAP presentation and the\nspecificity of Moore-Williams’ testimony about what she\nheard certain teachers discussing.\n\n      Moore-Williams’ testimony, taken along with the\nevidence itself, clearly supports a reasonable inference that\n\n                                44\n\fLMSD both was a proprietor of and, through their teachers\nand other personnel, used the MAP. The document is on\nLMSD’s letterhead in its header and LMSD supplied it in\ndiscovery. There is no suggestion that it was fabricated, and\nneither the Majority nor the District Court contest the veracity\nof the document. Yet, because Plaintiffs could not identify\nthe author of this document it was deemed inadmissible.\n\n       As a final matter, the Majority contends that the\nDistrict Court properly rejected Moore-Williams’ testimony\nas inadmissible hearsay. Majority Op. at 89-90. However,\nMoore-Williams was testifying about statements teachers\nmade to her about the conclusions in the MAP. It certainly\nappears that the statements were made by teachers acting\nwithin the scope of their duties as teachers at LMSD, and\nneither my colleagues nor the District Court suggest anything\nto the contrary. Accordingly, those statements were not\nhearsay. They were party opponent admissions. See Fed. R.\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(D) (noting that a statement is not hearsay\nwhen “[t]he statement is offered against an opposing party\nand . . . was made by the party’s agent or employee on a\nmatter within the scope of that relationship and while it\nexisted.”).\n\nD. Testimony of Psychologists and Parents Supports\nPlaintiffs’ Contention that Race is a Factor in Assigning\nStudents to Special Education Classes\n\n        Plaintiffs produced the expert Rebuttal Report of\nTawanna J. Jones, Ed. S. Certified School Psychologist. See\nid. at 2306. Her Curriculum Vitae was attached to her report,\nand her expertise in the appropriate areas is not disputed.23\nShe was retained by Plaintiffs to rebut the expert report of\nReschly, LMSD’s expert. Jones was specifically asked to\n\n23\n   Jones was then serving as a Certified School Psychologist\nfor the School District of Philadelphia. Her primary\nresponsibilities included evaluating students and determining\neligibility for Special Education Services. She was also a\ncollaborative team member working to ensure proper student\nplacement, provision of adequate services, “development of\nappropriate behavioral and academic goals, and transition\nplanning for post-secondary options.” J.A. at 2306.\n\n                                45\n\fgive her expert opinion about “whether: (1) each of the\nstudent Plaintiffs were properly identified by [LMSD] as\nhaving a learning disability; (2) based on LMSD’s placement\nof each student Plaintiffs [sic] into low level and/or special\neducation classes, were the student Plaintiffs denied the\nequality of education they should have otherwise received . . .\n.” Id. at 2307-08. Jones found that the students whose files\nshe reviewed were erroneously evaluated by the school\ndistrict. See J.A. at 2318-20. Specifically, as discussed\nbelow, three of the plaintiffs, Q.G, C.H., and S.H., were\nincorrectly placed in special education courses although they\ndid not meet the criteria for placement in those courses. Id.\nJones’s testimony is corroborated and supported by the\ntestimony of Dr. Barbara Shapiro, Ph.D. the Assistant\nDirector of Pupil Services, who supervised school\npsychologists at LMSD.\n\n        Jones opined that Plaintiff Q.G., an African-American\nstudent at LMSD, “was incorrectly identified by LMSD as a\nstudent who met the criteria for a Learning Disability in the\narea of Language Arts.” Id. at 2318. She added: “[a]s an\ninitial matter of import, Language Arts is not a disability\ncategory.” Id. at 2318 (emphasis in original). Thus, even\nassuming the accuracy of LMSD’s conclusion that Q.G. was\ndeficient in Language Arts, according to the undisputed\ntestimony of Plaintiffs’ expert, that should not have resulted\nin Q.G. being placed in special education classes. Q.G.’s\nacademic skills then declined over time “after being placed in\nSpecial Education.” Id. at 2319 (emphasis in original).\n\n       The dubious nature of Q.G.’s placement based on a\nsingle deficiency is corroborated by the testimony of Shapiro.\nShapiro began working in the LMSD in the fall of 2003 as\nAssistant Director of Pupil Services. J.A. at 1387. She\nsupervised ten school psychologists in that capacity until\nMarch 1, 2009, during that time she “collaborated with the\nspecial ed supervisors regarding special ed services district\nwide.” Id.\n\n       Shapiro testified that no student should ever be placed\ninto special education classes based on one score. Id. at\n1393. “As a psychologist, you would look at the entire\npicture of a child and never just determine a disability based\n\n\n                               46\n\fon one piece of information.” Id. Yet, that was not the\nprocess used to place Q.G. in special education classes that\nshe did not need, and which impeded her educational\ndevelopment.\n\n       Shapiro also testified that LMSD did not comply with\nthe American Psychological Association’s protocol for record\nretention. J.A. at 1397. This meant that testing protocols that\ndetermined students’ placement in classes were sometimes\ndestroyed before parents could examine (and thereby\nchallenge) them. Although parents were informed that they\nhad a right to request these protocols, Shapiro did not believe\nthat parents were ever informed of this shortened retention\npolicy. The result was that parents would often ask to see\ntheir child’s testing protocols, only to learn they had already\nbeen disposed of. Id.24\n\n       Jones also opined that the initial evaluation for another\nAfrican-American student, Plaintiff C.H., “provided a clear\nindication, that there were deficits and needs in the areas of\nReading Comprehension and Basic reading skills (reading\ndecoding).” However, “[t]here was no evidence, . . . that she\nmet the criteria for SLD [specific learning disability] in the\narea of Written Expression or Mathematics.” Id. at 2319.\nJones believed that the absence of data made it impossible to\ngive C.H. the support she needed to address the one area\nwhere she appeared deficient, and still allow her to progress\nnormally in the areas where the need for such support was not\nindicated. Id. at 2319-20.\n\n       Jones’ evaluation of yet another student, Plaintiff S.H.,\nmay be the most troubling. “All of S.H.’s skills and abilities\nmeasured in the ‘Average’ range at the point of the initial\nassessment . . . . Despite the lack of evidence required to\ndetermine eligibility, the evaluator labeled S.H. as meeting\nthe criteria for a SLD and subsequently doomed S.H. to an\nacademic experience [in special ed – low expectation courses]\n\n24\n   I mention this evidence merely to illustrate the extent to\nwhich Plaintiffs raised genuine disputes of material facts\nregarding those claims and they should have been resolved by\na fact finder. I am not suggesting that this necessarily proves\nnefarious conduct by LMSD employees.\n\n                                47\n\fthat impeded her development rather than remediated or\naccelerated her academic progress.” Id. at 2320. According\nto Dr. Jones, “[i]t is evident from the data provided that S.H.\nwas never a candidate for Special Education under the\nauspices of a SLD.” Id. In her view, “[i]t is apparent that\nsubsequent evaluators either were not aware of the criteria for\na SLD or intentionally chose to ignore the criteria as\ndemonstrated by the fact that S.H.’s not initially meeting the\ncriteria for SLD was never subsequently addressed by\nLMSD.” Id.\n\n       S.H.’s mother testified that she did not believe her\ndaughter was denied educational services per se, but was\ntroubled because S.H. was placed in lower level courses that\nwere not demanding. S.H.’s mother did not initially object to\nthe placement because she received letters from LMSD\ninforming her that S.H. was receiving reading support, which\nS.H.’s mother interpreted as giving her daughter extra help.\nShe said that “[N]obody in the school told [her] that it was a\nremedial course, no. I just thought it was an enrichment. It\nwas presented as an enrichment course to help kids with\nreading. So, to me, more is better.” 25 Id. at 1165. Like most\nof the parents here, S.H.’s mother did not initially object\nbecause she trusted the school officials and assumed they\nwere acting in S.H.’s best interests. S.H.’s mother testified\nthat she finally objected to S.H.’s placement after an\nindependent psychologist evaluated S.H. in tenth grade and\nconcluded that S.H. did not have a learning disability.\nAccording to the mother, the school then gave her\n“pushback.” Id. at 1167; see generally, id. at 1153-67. This\npushback demonstrates that the school was aware of the\nissues involved in S.H.’s placement, and responded in a\nmanner that a jury could conclude was deliberately\nindifferent.\n\n      The differing kinds of omissions and irregularities\nevidenced by Dr. Jones’ assessment of the placements of\nQ.G., C.H., S.H., as well as Shapiro’s testimony, reflect some\n\n25\n   Although the District Court held that S.H.’s mother’s\ntestimony was inadmissible with respect to other issues (third\nhand accounts of teachers’ statements to students), this\ntestimony does not provide any such problem.\n\n                               48\n\fof the difficulties in the way this case has been litigated as\nwell as some of the conceptual difficulties and confusion\ninherent in the litigation posture here. Indeed, counsel for\nCBP addressed this concern at oral argument:\n\n       The general confusion in this case is that\n       initially there were special-education claims in\n       the case; those claims were dismissed because\n       of failure to exhaust. There were also Title VI\n       claims. What happened was, through the course\n       of discovery and though the process of\n       evaluations, the children discovered that . . .\n       most of them had never had the disabilities that\n       the district said they had.26\n\nTranscript of Oral Argument at 17, Blunt v. Lower Merion\nSchool District, --F.3d-- (Nos. 11-4200, 11-4201, 11-4315).\nAt the risk of repetition: “the totality of the evidence . . . must\nguide our analysis rather than the strength of each individual\nargument.” Bray v. Marriott Hotels, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739304\"><a href=\"/opinion/739304/73-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1163-70-empl-prac-dec-p-44755-beryl-bray/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (3d\nCir. 1997).\n\n        In response to this glaring evidence in support of\nPlaintiffs’ claims that they were placed into special education\nclasses because of their race rather than their relative\nacademic need, the Majority simply makes a blanket assertion\nthat “if the same evaluation procedures are used for all\nstudents or [sic] their race there is simply no discrimination.”\nMajority Op. at 93. This statement is deeply problematic for\ntwo reasons. First, it assumes that the procedures themselves\ncannot be discriminatory. Second, and most importantly here, it\nassumes the “procedures” comprise the whole of the evaluation,\n\n26\n   The District Court commented on what it must have seen as\na “moving target” by noting: “[i]n their brief in opposition to\nthe motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs now assert that\nthey are not disabled and were wrongly placed in special\neducation programs on the basis of race. This assertion that\nthey are not disabled is in stark contrast to the Third\nAmended Complaint . . .” Blunt, 826 F.Supp.2d at 753.\nHowever, for purposes of deciding the summary judgment\nmotion, the District Court assumed that the student plaintiffs\nwere “in fact not disabled.” Id. at 754 n.4.\n\n                                 49\n\fthus ignoring the discretion and subjectivity afforded the examiner\nwho is applying the procedures and interpreting the results of the\nevaluations.\n\n       As noted above, clearly the procedures were not\napplied appropriately with respect to Plaintiffs. LMSD’s own\nAssistant Director of Pupil Services testified that procedures\nwere not followed, including those for dictating which\nstudents should be placed in special education classes. See\nsupra at 71-72. For instance, as noted above, LMSD\nevaluated Q.G. as having a learning disability in the subject\nof language arts, which is not even a disability category. J.A.\nat 2318. This directly belies the Majority’s broad assertion\nthat as long as the procedures are neutral, the consequences\ncannot, as a matter of law, be considered discriminatory.\nSimilar procedures and evaluative tools can always be applied\nin patently discriminatory ways, and evidence of their\nmisapplication with respect to the Plaintiffs is certainly\nevidence of discrimination and deliberate indifference. See\ninfra n. 16 at 34.\n\n       It is, of course, possible to argue that the errors in\nplacement on this record are simply the result of the district’s\nless than desirable and inartful method of selecting students\nfor special education classes. Mistakes can surely happen,\nespecially in such a complicated, subtle and intricate process\nas identifying students who cannot handle regular academic\nwork in a classroom. However, LMSD had every opportunity\nto come forward with evidence that numbers of White\nstudents are also mistakenly placed in special education\nclasses and that could have negated the causal nexus of the\nerroneous placement of these African-American plaintiffs. It\noffered no such evidence.\n\n       Even if it could be argued that the decision to forego\nproduction of any such evidence results from political\nconsiderations rather than absence of such proof (and nothing\non this record supports such rank speculation), the fact\nremains that this record only contains evidence of African-\nAmerican students erroneously being labeled as “learning\ndisabled” and being denied the full benefits of a public\neducation. There is no evidence of this happening with White\nstudents and the inference that Plaintiffs are entitled to should\n\n\n                                 50\n\fprevent the LMSD from getting an evidentiary bye.\nMoreover, to the extent that innocent mistakes happen in\nplacement, it should be noted that, where the more\nchallenging curricula is concerned, all such mistakes seem to\nhappen in only one direction. There were no African-\nAmerican students in “high expectation,” college prep or\nadvanced placement classes in the school district during the\nyears the experts studied. Speculation about diagnostic error\nis simply that—“speculation;” it should play no role in our\nlegal inquiry.\n\nF.  There is Testimony that Teachers and School\nAdministrators Had Notice of These Allegations\n\n        Plaintiffs have also put forward sufficient evidence of\ndeliberate indifference. They established that LMSD was\naware of the racial problems arising from the classroom\nassignments and provision of resources, and it ignored\nPlaintiffs’ requests to remedy the racial disparities. As noted\nin the section on CBP’s standing above, Ms. Metzger, a\nformer special education teacher at LMSD, testified that as a\nteacher she “was invited to and sat in on a portion of a\nConcerned Black Parents conversation with some of the\nschool administrators.” J.A. at 1456. At this meeting, parents\nand students raised concerns that “African-American\nstudents, as a whole, as we have discussed, were not\nperforming at the same rate, not experiencing the same\nsuccess as other students; that [African American families in\nthe District] believed that [African American] students didn’t\nfeel welcome in the school; that [African American families\nin the District] believed that at times, guidance counselors or\nothers, personnel, maybe didn’t afford the same consideration\nwhen it came to the college planning process.” Id. (emphasis\nadded). As Metzger’s testimony makes clear, the “school\nadministrators” who attended this meeting along with her had\nnotice that African American families had complained that\nthey were not receiving the same education as their peers,\nand, yet, nothing changed.\n\n        In addition, as I discussed above, when the mother of\none of these plaintiffs objected to her daughter being\nidentified as having a learning disability, the school gave her\n“pushback,” rather than undertaking an inquiry into the\n\n                               51\n\fappropriateness of her daughter’s placement in special\neducation. J.A. at 1167.\n\n                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe all recognize the difficulty of identifying students who are\nbest served by the kind of remediation that special education\nclasses are intended to provide. and that no process of\nevaluation is perfect. However, this case is not about second-\nguessing the placement of students in remedial classes. It is\nnot about frustrated hopes of parents or students. And,\ndespite the specter of the The Quota Boogeyman raised by the\nMajority,27 it is not about how many African-American\nstudents should be placed in a particular academic track.\n\n       This case is about whether courts will allow plaintiffs\nwho have produced the kind of proof that I have discussed\nabove to survive summary judgment and have their day in\ncourt to prove something as subjective and evasive as the\ndeliberate indifference that is tantamount to racial bias.\n\n       When plaintiffs can produce the kind of evidence that\nhas been produced here, the law requires that their ultimate\nclaims of bias be determined by a fact finder, not by a court.\nAs Judge Baylson stated in Doe 1 v. Lower Merion Sch.\nDist.:“The Supreme Court has clarified that [d]etermining\nwhether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating\nfactor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent as may be available.” 689 F.\nSupp. 2d at 755. (emphasis in original, internal quotation\nmarks omitted). That is sorely lacking here.\n\n        I also note the laudable caution of Judge Baylson in\nDoe 1, in explaining: “[this] Court is particularly reluctant to\ngrant summary judgment and to deny Plaintiffs the right to\ntrial in this case, which involves issues of public policy and\ngreat concern to the community.” Id.\n\n\n27\n  See Majority Op. at 94 (“We certainly are not going to\nrequire or even suggest that school districts use a quota\nsystem in assigning students to special education classes [to\nachieve proportionality].”).\n\n                                52\n\f        I therefore must respectfully disagree with my\ncolleagues’ belief that the District Court did not err in\nconcluding that no genuine dispute of material fact exists on\nthis record.\n\n\n\n\n                              53\n\f</pre>",
