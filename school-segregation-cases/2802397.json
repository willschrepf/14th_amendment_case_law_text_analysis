AP-76,100\n\n\n\n                         JOHN HENRY RAMIREZ, Appellant\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                THE STATE OF TEXAS\n\n\n\n              ON DIRECT APPEAL FROM CAUSE NO. 04-CR-3453-C\n                       IN THE 94 TH DISTRICT COURT\n                            NUECES COUNTY\n\n\n\n       M EYERS, J., delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court.\n\n                                      OPINION\n\n       Appellant was convicted in December 2008 of capital murder. T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\nA NN. § 19.03(a)(2). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in the\n\nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 37.071, Sections 2(b) and 2(e), the trial judge\n\f                                                                                     Ramirez - 2\n\nsentenced appellant to death. Art. 37.071, § 2(g).1 Direct appeal to this Court is\n\nautomatic. Art. 37.071, § 2(h). After reviewing appellant’s six points of error, we find\n\nthem to be without merit. Consequently, we affirm the trial court’s judgment and\n\nsentence of death.\n\n                                  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Appellant was charged with intentionally causing the death of Pablo Castro by\n\nstabbing him with a knife while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the\n\noffense of robbery. Lydia Salinas testified that she had known Castro for ten to fifteen\n\nyears. She was the manager and cashier of Times Market, the convenience store where\n\nCastro worked, and they regularly worked the night shift together. Castro would come to\n\nwork around 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m., and Salinas would arrive at 6:00 p.m. They worked\n\nuntil the store closed at midnight, and they usually took turns buying dinner. On the night\n\nof July 19, 2004, Castro told Salinas that he had only a dollar, so she bought them both\n\ndinner. Salinas’s sister-in-law brought it to the store for them. She told Salinas that there\n\nwas a van parked in the area where she usually parked. After she left, Salinas and Castro\n\nfinished eating. A short time later, a young Hispanic woman came into the store to use\n\nthe bathroom. Salinas remembered her because she asked to use the “facilities,” which\n\nwas unusual. Salinas later identified the woman as Angela Rodriguez.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Unless otherwise indicated all references to Articles refer to the Code of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 3\n\n       As closing time approached, Castro told Salinas that he was going out to empty the\n\ntrash. Salinas was busy counting money at the cash register. A few minutes later, a girl\n\ncame in and told her that there was a bleeding man lying in the parking lot. Salinas\n\nthought that Castro had probably come back inside by then and was working in the back\n\nof the store, so she called out to let him know that she was going outside. She stepped\n\noutside and confirmed that someone was lying in the parking lot, and then she went back\n\nin and called 9-1-1. She yelled for Castro to come to the front of the store before she\n\nwent back outside to see if she could help. She took a closer look at the man in the\n\nparking lot and realized that he was Castro. She screamed and started toward him, but a\n\nneighbor and some people who had come from the car wash next door held her back and\n\ntold her that he was dead.\n\n       Mariano Cervantes testified that he and Kashif Butt worked together at another\n\nstore that closed at 11:00 p.m. After they closed up their store for the night, they drove to\n\nthe car wash located next to Times Market. As they were getting ready to wash their cars,\n\nButt called Cervantes’s attention to a fight that was going on in the Times Market parking\n\nlot. Cervantes saw a young man and woman standing on either side of an “older\n\ngentleman” and hitting him. The older man looked like he was trying to get out of the\n\nway. Cervantes testified that he recognized the young man because they had gone to the\n\nsame school, but he did not recognize the woman. Cervantes and Butt started toward the\n\nparking lot to see if they could help the older man. Cervantes saw the older man fall, and\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 4\n\nhe saw the young man and woman get into two separate vans. He did not see anyone\n\nreach into the victim’s pockets. The assailants were gone by the time he reached the\n\nvictim. Cervantes had not seen a knife during the fight, but when the victim tilted his\n\nhead back, Cervantes could see a large bloody gash on his throat. The victim was\n\nconscious when Cervantes first tried to talk to him, but he was gurgling and spitting out\n\nblood, and soon he closed his eyes and stopped responding. Cervantes believed he was\n\ndead.\n\n        After reviewing his statement to police, Cervantes acknowledged that he had told\n\npolice that he saw the woman trying to reach into the victim’s pockets. He also\n\nacknowledged that his statement did not include the information that he recognized the\n\nman who attacked the victim. He further acknowledged that he was not able to positively\n\nidentify Rodriguez when police officers took him to see her later that evening. He\n\nrecalled saying that the person they showed him looked like her but that he was not “a\n\nhundred percent sure.”\n\n        Kashif Butt testified that, after work, he and Cervantes went to the car wash next\n\nto Times Market. They were about to start washing their cars when Butt heard sounds of\n\narguing or fighting coming from the store parking lot. He saw the victim being beaten up\n\nby a man and woman. He did not see a weapon. He described the assailants as being\n\nabout 5' 6\" tall and Hispanic. The man was “built,” and the woman was skinny. The\n\nvictim was about 5' 6\", in his 40’s, and heavy. The assailants were punching and kicking\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 5\n\nhim, and the victim was trying to block their punches and kicks. After he fell, the\n\nassailants kept beating him and kicking him. Eventually they stopped and went through\n\nhis pockets, got something out, and then left. Butt saw them get into a big red Ford van.\n\nA third person was sitting in the driver’s seat. Upon reviewing his statement to police,\n\nButt remembered that there was a second van, but he still recalled that both assailants got\n\ninto the van with the waiting driver. He did not recall what happened to the second van.\n\nThe victim was barely alive when Butt and Cervantes reached him. Butt saw that the\n\nvictim was bleeding badly from his throat.\n\n       On cross-examination, Butt acknowledged that he did not see the man and woman\n\nusing any motions that he would describe as “stabbing movements,” but instead he saw\n\nmotions that he described as “straight punch[es] or side punches.” He said that he was\n\npretty sure that both the man and the woman went through the victim’s pockets and took\n\nsomething. He reiterated that he did not know what happened to the second van.\n\n       Officer Mike Wenzel, who responded first to Salinas’s 9-1-1 call, testified that\n\nwhen he arrived at Times Market, the victim was lying in a pool of blood. He had been\n\nstabbed in the neck and his throat had been slashed. His wounds were consistent with\n\nknife wounds. He was not breathing or bleeding, and Wenzel concluded that he was\n\ndead. Wenzel tried to secure the scene while he waited for additional officers to arrive.\n\nHe spoke with Salinas, Cervantes, and Butt, and learned that the suspects were both about\n\n5'8\" and wearing blue jeans and T-shirts. The woman was slim and between 20 and 30\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 6\n\nyears old. The suspects had fled in two red full-size conversion vans, with the woman\n\ngetting into the passenger side of one van and the man getting into the driver’s side of the\n\nother van. Wenzel gave this information to the police dispatcher, who issued an alert to\n\nall the officers in the city to be on the lookout for the suspects’ vehicles.\n\n       Christina Chavez, one of appellant’s accomplices, testified that, at the time of the\n\noffense, she and Angela Rodriguez lived together in San Antonio, but they had traveled to\n\nCorpus Christi to visit Rodriguez’s family for the weekend. Rodriguez knew appellant,\n\nand the three of them drank and used drugs together for three or four days. When\n\nappellant came to Rodriguez’s mother’s house, Rodriguez snuck him in because her\n\nmother did not want him there. He was showing off a ridged knife. Rodriguez’s mother\n\nkicked him out of her house when she discovered him, but he came back later that day\n\nwith Rodriguez’s sister, Roberta Garcia. Chavez, Rodriguez, and appellant left Garcia at\n\nher mother’s house when they went out again. They pawned some things for drug money.\n\nLater, they went to appellant’s friend’s house where they used more drugs until they ran\n\nout. Chavez testified that in order to obtain money for more drugs, they agreed to grab\n\nsomeone and take his or her money, but they did not plan to hurt anyone. Only appellant\n\nhad a weapon. They got into two maroon vans and started driving, searching for someone\n\nto rob. Chavez testified that she drove one van, with Rodriguez as a passenger, while\n\nappellant drove the other van. They pulled into the parking lot of Times Market where\n\nthey saw a man carrying a bag to the dumpster. Rodriguez got out of the van and spoke to\n\f                                                                                    Ramirez - 7\n\nhim, and then returned to the van. Chavez then saw that appellant was fighting with the\n\nman. She told Rodriguez, who got back out of the van to see what was going on. Chavez\n\ntestified that Rodriguez did not join in the fight but instead tried to get appellant off of the\n\nman. Appellant used the knife he had been showing off earlier to stab the man until he\n\nfell to his knees. After the man fell backward onto the ground, appellant pointed to\n\nRodriguez, and then Rodriguez went through the man’s pockets. Chavez did not see\n\nappellant go through the victim’s pockets. Although she did not see Rodriguez take\n\nanything out of the victim’s pocket, she saw Rodriguez drop $1.25 onto the console when\n\nshe got back into the van. Chavez thought that the money came from the victim’s pocket.\n\nBoth appellant and Rodriguez had blood on them, so they found a place to rinse off.\n\n       Because they still did not have money for drugs, they committed an aggravated\n\nrobbery, and then they attempted to commit another. Chavez testified that she waited in\n\nthe van while appellant and Rodriguez committed these offenses. After the aggravated\n\nrobbery, Rodriguez told Chavez to get into the van that appellant was driving, and from\n\nthen on, the group rode together in one van. As they were driving away from the\n\nattempted robbery, they were seen by police and a chase ensued, but they eluded the\n\npolice car that pursued them. They drove to an area of town known as “The Cut,” where\n\nappellant drove the van into a lot that was overgrown with bushes and tall grass. They\n\nclimbed out of the van and continued on foot. Chavez and Rodriguez were soon arrested,\n\nbut appellant escaped. Chavez did not know what happened to appellant’s knife, which\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 8\n\nwas never recovered, but she recalled that appellant told her he was keeping it as a\n\nsouvenir.\n\n       The victims of the aggravated robbery and the attempted aggravated robbery also\n\ntestified. April Metting, the aggravated-robbery victim, testified that while she was\n\nwaiting in line at the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant, a young woman\n\nwalked up to the front of her car and asked to use her cell phone. The woman said that\n\nshe had been in a fight and pointed to blood stains on her shirt. While Metting’s attention\n\nwas focused on the woman, a man came up behind her and reached into her open window\n\nwith a ridged knife. He grabbed her by the back of her neck as he held the knife to her\n\nthroat and demanded money. Metting testified that she was scared and asked them not to\n\ndo this in front of her two-year-old son, who was sitting in the back seat, but the man just\n\nsaid, “Shut up, bitch.” The woman also told her to shut up and give them her purse. She\n\ngave the man her money and her purse, and then the woman and man got into a van with\n\nanother woman and left. Metting saw two vans parked nearby in the restaurant parking\n\nlot, but the suspects left together in only one of them. She said that she learned during the\n\ninvestigation that the young woman who had asked to use her cell phone was Chavez.\n\nShe also identified a wallet and credit card that had been taken from her during the\n\nrobbery and that were recovered from inside the Ford van.\n\f                                                                                      Ramirez - 9\n\n       Ruby Pena Hinojosa,2 the victim of the attempted aggravated robbery, testified to a\n\nsimilar incident at the drive-through window of another fast-food restaurant. A maroon\n\nvan pulled up next to her, and a thin woman with long, wavy hair got out and asked to use\n\nher cell phone. While they were talking, a man appeared at her driver’s side window, put\n\na serrated knife to her neck, and demanded money, but she was able to lean away from\n\nthe knife and roll up her window. The man then went around to her passenger side\n\nwindow and began banging on the glass with the blade of his knife while his accomplice\n\npeered into her back windows. The victim feared for her life. At that point, she backed\n\nup her car and the suspects got into the van and left. She got a good look at the man’s\n\nface and she later identified appellant in a photo lineup. These offenses took place within\n\nminutes of the Times Market offense.\n\n       Garcia, Rodriguez’s sister, testified that, during the weekend leading up to the\n\noffense, she drank and did drugs with appellant, Rodriguez, and Chavez. Appellant\n\nshowed her his knife, which had ridges or teeth on the side. She was out with them\n\nearlier on the day of the offense, but appellant dropped her, Rodriguez, and Chavez off at\n\nRodriguez’s mother’s house. Later, when appellant returned to the house and picked up\n\nRodriguez and Chavez, Garcia did not go with them. The next time she saw appellant\n\nwas when he showed up at the front door after midnight, out of breath and covered in\n\ngrass and dirt. He said that they had stabbed someone and that the police were after him.\n\n       2\n         When this victim testified at trial, she was identified as “Ruby Pena Hinojosa,” but she\nwas identified in an indictment against appellant as “Ruby Pena.”\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 10\n\nHe would not tell her where Rodriguez was. At one point, he said he stabbed Rodriguez,\n\nbut at another point, he said that he thought she had gotten away. He had a big gash on\n\nhis right hand that was bleeding heavily. He ran away when Garcia told him to leave.\n\n       Pamela Smith, a forensic scientist for the Texas Department of Public Safety,\n\ntestified that DNA test results of samples taken from blood on the driver’s-side door\n\nhandle, steering wheel, and passenger door pocket of the Ford van that was recovered\n\nfrom the overgrown lot were consistent with appellant’s DNA profile. Smith was able to\n\nsay with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that appellant was the source of those\n\nsamples. Samples from other items found in the van were also consistent with appellant’s\n\nDNA profile. Samples taken from blood on the steering wheel cover were consistent with\n\na mixture of appellant’s and Castro’s DNA profiles.\n\n       Smith testified further that samples taken from blood on the gear shift lever, a\n\nT-shirt, and a vodka bottle found inside the Ford van were consistent with Castro’s DNA\n\nprofile. A sample taken from blood on an armrest inside the Dodge van that had been\n\nabandoned during the second robbery was also consistent with Castro’s DNA profile.\n\nSamples from blood on the blue jean shorts Rodriguez was wearing when she was\n\narrested were consistent with Castro’s DNA profile. Smith was able to say with a\n\nreasonable degree of scientific certainty that Castro was the source of those samples.\n\n       Rey Fernandez, the medical examiner, testified about his examination and autopsy\n\nof Castro. He identified twenty-nine sharp force injuries consistent with knife wounds,\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 11\n\nten of which were stab wounds that penetrated Castro’s body and nineteen of which were\n\nincised or slash-type wounds. Eight of the injuries were defensive wounds on Castro’s\n\nright forearm and hand. The majority of the stab wounds were concentrated around\n\nCastro’s head, neck, shoulders, and back. Fernandez also observed evidence of blunt\n\nforce trauma on Castro’s face and neck, as if he had been punched or kicked. A\n\ntoxicology screen detected no alcohol or illegal drugs in Castro’s body.\n\n       Officer James Gray testified that as he and his partner were heading toward the\n\nscene of the attempted robbery, they passed a red van matching the general description of\n\nthe suspect vehicle. They shined a spotlight into the van and saw a man and woman in\n\nthe front. Gray identified appellant in court as the man he saw driving the van. They\n\nmade a U-turn and followed the van, turning on their lights and attempting to stop it.\n\nInitially, the driver of the van pulled over and stopped, but as soon as Gray opened the\n\ndoor of his patrol unit and stepped out, the driver of the van drove away. Gray got back\n\ninto the car and he and his partner pursued the van. They sent out a description of the\n\nvehicle, its location, and the direction it was heading. The driver of the van accelerated to\n\nspeeds of over 70 miles per hour and traveled through intersections without slowing\n\ndown, until eventually the officers lost sight of the van on the north side of town. They\n\nagain sent out information about where the van was last seen and the direction it had been\n\nheading.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 12\n\n       Officer Michael Frakes testified that he responded to a call for all available units to\n\nmove to the area of town where the vehicle pursuit was happening. He was familiar with\n\nthe Port area, which was within a mile of where the van had last been seen, so he drove to\n\nthat area to look around. While he was driving down a dark street, he saw “a red flash\n\nlike a reflector.” He shined his spotlight toward it and saw the right rear corner of a red\n\nvan that had been driven off the road into a wooded area. Aware that the suspects might\n\nbe dangerous, he turned off his spotlight and called for assistance. After another officer\n\narrived, Frakes walked up to the van and discovered that it was empty, but the engine was\n\nstill hot. Additional officers arrived to help search the area for the suspects. Frakes soon\n\nheard that another officer had arrested two women just beyond the brush where the van\n\nwas found.\n\n       Officer Ralph Vasquez testified that he heard about the pursuit of the van while it\n\nwas happening and he moved into a parallel pursuit so that he would be close at hand in\n\ncase the van broke away from the pursuing unit. After learning that the van had broken\n\naway, he responded to the call for all available units to search for it. When he learned\n\nthat the van had been found, he decided to circle around the brush area where it was\n\nlocated to see if he could find any suspects. He saw two white shapes moving, turned his\n\nheadlights toward them, and discovered two women who matched the suspects’\n\ndescriptions. He and another officer arrested them. Their clothes were soiled and bloody.\n\f                                                                                    Ramirez - 13\n\nBased on the way the women acted, Officer Vasquez believed that they were under the\n\ninfluence of a mixture of alcohol and drugs.3\n\n                            SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n       In his first point of error, appellant asserts that the evidence is legally insufficient\n\nto prove that he is guilty of capital murder. Within the body of this argument, appellant\n\nalso asserts that Chavez’s accomplice-witness testimony was not sufficiently\n\ncorroborated. Thus, this point of error raises two distinct legal theories: (1) the evidence\n\nwas legally insufficient; and (2) the conviction cannot be sustained under Article 38.14.\n\nSee Cathey v. State, 992 S.W.2d 460, 462 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (expressly\n\ndistinguishing legal and factual sufficiency standards from the accomplice-witness\n\nstandard of review under Article 38.14). We will address each theory in turn.4\n\n                                      A. Legal Sufficiency\n\n       Appellant concedes that there was direct evidence that he stabbed the victim, but\n\nhe argues that the evidence presented at trial did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nhe was responsible for the underlying offense of robbery. He asserts that Chavez’s\n\ntestimony that appellant pointed to Rodriguez after the victim fell to the ground and\n\nbefore Rodriguez went through the victim’s pockets did not prove that appellant solicited,\n\n\n       3\n         Appellant eluded the manhunt. He was finally apprehended near the Texas/Mexico\nborder on February 20, 2008.\n       4\n         Appellant’s accomplice-witness-rule theory renders this point of error multifarious, but\nwe will address both theories. See Vasquez v. State, 67 S.W.3d 229, 236 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2002).\n\f                                                                                       Ramirez - 14\n\nencouraged, directed, aided, or attempted to aid Rodriguez to commit the offense of\n\nrobbery.5 He also argues that the eyewitness who testified that he saw both appellant and\n\nRodriguez going through the victim’s pockets “effectively withdrew” his testimony on\n\ncross-examination.6\n\n       Due process of law requires that an appellant’s conviction be supported by\n\nevidence sufficient to rationally prove all of the elements of the offense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. See Wilkerson v. State, 881 S.W.2d 321, 324 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).\n\nIn assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, an appellate\n\ncourt must consider all of the record evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nWesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 111 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). The court must\n\ndetermine whether, based on that evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of all the elements of the\n\noffense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).\n\n\n\n\n       5\n          Appellant also argues that Chavez’s testimony is insufficient because Chavez\ncommitted perjury and was an interested witness and accomplice. He refers to portions of the\nrecord in which the prosecutor chided Chavez for attempting to minimize her involvement in the\noffenses, or told her that a jury would have trouble believing her. However, these events alone\ndo not establish that Chavez committed perjury. It was for the jury, not this Court, to evaluate\nChavez’s credibility and weigh her testimony. See Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 111 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2000).\n       6\n         In his brief, appellant identifies this witness as Cervantes, but the record reflects that\nButt was the witness who testified that both appellant and Rodriguez went through the victim’s\npockets.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 15\n\n       In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we look at events occurring\n\nbefore, during, and after the commission of the offense, and we may rely on actions of the\n\nappellant that show an understanding and common design to do the prohibited act.\n\nGuevara v. State, 152 S.W.3d 45, 49 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Each fact need not point\n\ndirectly and independently to the appellant’s guilt, so long as the cumulative effect of all\n\nthe incriminating facts are sufficient to support the conviction. Id. Under this standard,\n\naccomplice-witness testimony can be sufficient to support a conviction. Taylor v. State,\n\n10 S.W.3d 673, 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       As pled in the indictment, the offense of capital murder is committed when (1) a\n\nperson (2) intentionally (3) causes the death (4) of an individual (5) while in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit robbery. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 19.03(a)(2); see\n\nalso Wilkerson, 881 S.W.2d at 323. In this case, appellant does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence with regard to his intent to cause Castro’s death. Instead, he\n\nchallenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence with regard to whether he acted in the\n\ncourse of committing or attempting to commit robbery. However, the record contains\n\nample evidence to support the conviction.\n\n       Appellant was charged with intentionally or knowingly causing Castro’s death by\n\nstabbing him while in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. The\n\njury charge provided that appellant was criminally responsible for an offense committed\n\nby the conduct of another if, acting with intent to promote or assist in the commission of\n\f                                                                                     Ramirez - 16\n\nthe offense, he solicited, encouraged, directed, aided, or attempted to aid the other person\n\nto commit the offense. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 7.02(a)(2). Appellant now asserts that\n\nChavez’s testimony that he pointed to Rodriguez before she went through Castro’s\n\npockets is too vague to show that he solicited, encouraged, directed, aided, or attempted\n\nto aid Rodriguez to commit the offense of robbery. Therefore, he reasons, he was not\n\ncriminally responsible for the robbery committed by Rodriguez.\n\n       As an initial matter, it is not necessary to determine whether appellant could be\n\nheld criminally responsible for Rodriguez’s conduct because the record contains evidence\n\nthat appellant directly participated in the robbery. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 7.01(a) (a\n\nperson is criminally responsible if an offense is committed by his own conduct, by the\n\nconduct of another for which he is criminally responsible, or by both). An eyewitness,\n\nButt, testified that he saw both appellant and Rodriguez going through the victim’s\n\npockets. On cross-examination, Butt continued to say he was “pretty sure” that he saw\n\nboth the man and woman going through the victim’s pockets. This testimony was\n\nevidence that appellant directly participated in the robbery. See Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at\n\n111.7 Considering all the record evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\n\ndetermine that a rational trier of fact could have found appellant guilty of all the elements\n\n\n       7\n          Appellant also complains that he was not properly identified in court as the person who\ncommitted the offense. Specifically, he complains that, after Cervantes’s in-court identification\nof appellant as the young man he saw attacking the victim, the prosecutor neglected to say, “Let\nthe record reflect that this witness has identified the defendant.” However, after the in-court\nidentifications of appellant by Butt, Garcia, and other witnesses, the prosecutor did recite words\nto the effect of, “Let the record reflect that this witness has identified the defendant.”\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 17\n\nof capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt, even without the alternative theory of\n\nliability provided in section 7.02(a)(2).\n\n       Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the evidence was legally insufficient to\n\nfind appellant guilty of directly participating in the robbery, the record also contains\n\nample evidence that appellant was guilty of the underlying robbery under Penal Code §\n\n7.02(a)(2). Appellant’s act of pointing to Rodriguez was not the only evidence that he\n\nsolicited, directed, encouraged, or aided the commission of the robbery. His act of\n\nstabbing Castro encouraged and aided the commission of the robbery, and it was also\n\nevidence of appellant’s intent to commit the robbery. See Young v. State, 283 S.W.3d\n\n854, 862 (Tex. Crim. App.), cert denied, 130 S.Ct. 1015 (2009) (assaultive conduct was\n\nevidence of intent to commit robbery). Additionally, Chavez’s testimony that the group\n\nwas looking for someone to rob in order to obtain drug money was evidence that, when\n\nappellant stabbed Castro, he did so in order to encourage or aid the commission of the\n\nrobbery. See, e.g., Guevara, 152 S.W.3d at 50 & n.18 (motive is a circumstance\n\nindicating guilt, and intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence). The\n\nsubsequent aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery, during which appellant\n\nused his knife in attempts to obtain drug money, provided further evidence of appellant’s\n\nguilt. The evidence is legally sufficient to show that appellant was guilty of the\n\nunderlying offense of robbery because he participated in it directly and because he was\n\ncriminally responsible for Rodriguez’s conduct.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 18\n\n                                B. Accomplice Witness Rule\n\n       We now turn to appellant’s assertion that Chavez’s testimony concerning both the\n\nmurder and the underlying offense of robbery was not sufficiently corroborated under\n\nArticle 38.14. Chavez, who pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and received a sentence\n\nof twenty-five years for her role in this offense, was an accomplice as a matter of law.\n\nSee Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 567 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (accomplice as a matter\n\nof law is one who is susceptible to prosecution for the charged offense or a lesser\n\nincluded offense). The accomplice-witness rule mandates that a conviction cannot be had\n\nupon the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated by other evidence tending\n\nto connect the defendant with the offense. Art. 38.14. However, accomplice-witness\n\ntestimony in a capital murder case does not require corroboration concerning the elements\n\nof the aggravating offense, that is, the elements which distinguish murder from capital\n\nmurder. See McDuff v. State, 939 S.W.2d 607, 613 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997); see also May\n\nv. State, 738 S.W.2d 261, 266 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (no need for corroboration as to\n\nunderlying offense of robbery). Therefore, Chavez’s testimony concerning the underlying\n\noffense of robbery did not require corroboration.\n\n       Unlike legal sufficiency, the accomplice-witness rule is not derived from federal or\n\nstate constitutional principles. See Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491, 498 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2007). Therefore, “tendency to connect” rather than rational sufficiency is the\n\nstandard: the corroborating evidence need not be sufficient by itself to establish guilt.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 19\n\nCathey, 992 S.W.2d at 462. The non-accomplice evidence must simply link the accused\n\nin some way to the commission of the crime, such that rational jurors could conclude that\n\nthis evidence sufficiently tended to connect the accused to the offense. Castillo v. State,\n\n221 S.W.3d 689, 691 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Hernandez v. State, 939 S.W.2d 173, 179\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1997).\n\n       The sufficiency of the corroborating evidence is evaluated by eliminating the\n\naccomplice testimony from consideration and then examining the remaining portions of\n\nthe record for any evidence that tends to connect the accused with the commission of the\n\ncrime. Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356, 361 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Proof that the\n\naccused was at or near the scene of the crime at or about the time of its commission, when\n\ncoupled with other suspicious circumstances, may tend to connect the accused to the\n\ncrime so as to furnish sufficient corroboration to support a conviction. Brown v. State,\n\n672 S.W.2d 487, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). Evidence that the defendant was in the\n\ncompany of the accomplice near the time or place of the offense is also proper\n\ncorroborating evidence. McDuff, 939 S.W.2d at 613. If the combined weight of the\n\nnon-accomplice evidence tends to connect the defendant to the offense, then the\n\nrequirement of Article 38.14 has been fulfilled. Cathey, 992 S.W.2d at 462.\n\n       In this case, the following non-accomplice evidence tended to connect appellant to\n\nthe offense:\n\n       (1)     Two eyewitnesses testified that they saw a man and woman beating and\n               kicking the victim, who fell to the ground. The witnesses gave physical\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 20\n\n              descriptions of the assailants that were consistent with appellant and\n              Rodriguez. One of the witnesses recognized appellant from prior contact as\n              the man he saw attacking the victim. The man and woman left the scene in\n              red vans. When the witnesses tried to help the victim, they saw that his\n              throat had been slashed and he was bleeding heavily. He died within\n              minutes of the attack.\n\n       (2)    Rodriguez’s sister, Garcia, testified that appellant showed her a knife while\n              they drank and did drugs together. She testified that appellant and his\n              accomplices left the house together before the offense. After midnight,\n              appellant showed up at her front door and told her that they had stabbed\n              someone and the police were chasing him.\n\n       (3)    Shortly after the offense, a man and woman in a red van were observed\n              committing and attempting to commit additional robberies. The man\n              threatened the victims by holding a knife to their throats. One victim\n              identified appellant as the man who attacked her. Property belonging to the\n              other victim was found in the van.\n\n       (4)    A responding police officer identified appellant as the driver of the red van\n              that he pursued shortly after the offense. The officer described the evasive\n              maneuvers that appellant took to avoid being arrested.\n\n       (5)    A short time after the offense, a police officer observed a red van that had\n              been driven into an overgrown lot. It was empty, but the engine was still\n              hot. Appellant’s accomplices were arrested nearby. DNA testing revealed\n              that a mixture of appellant’s and Castro’s blood was on the steering wheel\n              cover.\n\n       Hence, the requirements of the accomplice-witness rule set forth in Article 38.14\n\nwere satisfied. We hold that the evidence was legally sufficient and that the accomplice-\n\nwitness testimony was sufficiently corroborated. Point of error one is overruled.\n\n                                    C. Factual Sufficiency\n\n       In his second point of error, appellant asserts that the evidence is factually\n\ninsufficient, in that it is too weak to prove that he is guilty of capital murder. This point\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 21\n\nof error is premised on our decision in Clewis v. State. 922 S.W.2d 126 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1996). However, in Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 895, 926 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010),\n\nwe overruled Clewis and concluded that the legal sufficiency standard set forth in Jackson\n\nv. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), is the only standard that a reviewing court should apply\n\nin determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support each element of a criminal\n\noffense that the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. See Martinez v.\n\nState, 327 S.W.3d 727, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Point of error two is overruled.\n\n            SUFFICIENCY OF FUTURE DANGEROUSNESS EVIDENCE\n\n       In his third point of error, appellant claims that the evidence is legally insufficient\n\nto support the jury’s affirmative finding of future dangerousness. In evaluating the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s answer to the future-dangerousness\n\nspecial issue, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat there is a probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence\n\nconstituting a continuing threat to society. Solomon, 49 S.W.3d at 362 & n.13. In\n\ndetermining the special issues, the jury is entitled to consider all of the evidence presented\n\nat both the guilt and punishment stages of trial. Art. 37.071, § 2(d)(1); see also Young,\n\n283 S.W.3d at 863. The circumstances of the offense and the facts surrounding it may\n\nprovide greater probative evidence than any punishment-phase evidence regarding the\n\nissue of future dangerousness. Kunkle v. State, 771 S.W.2d 435, 445-46 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 22\n\n1986). The jury may consider many factors when determining whether the defendant will\n\npose a continuing threat of violence to society. Keeton v. State, 724 S.W.2d 58, 61 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1987). Habitual drug abuse may constitute evidence of future dangerousness.\n\nWilkerson, 881 S.W.2d at 326.\n\n       The record shows that appellant had a history of disciplinary problems, arrests, and\n\nconvictions, many of which were associated with drug and alcohol abuse. His military\n\nrecords showed that, when he was nineteen years old, he was convicted in a summary\n\ncourt martial of being absent without leave for 163 days, using disrespectful language\n\ntoward a non-commissioned officer, failing to obey a general order (underage drinking),\n\nand drunk and disorderly conduct. Pursuant to a mental-health and substance-abuse\n\nscreening, appellant was diagnosed with a personality disorder with borderline, antisocial,\n\nand dependent traits. He did not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse and had no desire for\n\ntreatment.\n\n       Appellant informed the mental-health evaluator that he had been suspended from\n\nschool at the rate of nine or more times a year, typically resulting from “disrespecting”\n\nteachers and physically fighting with other students. The mental-health evaluator\n\ndetermined that appellant had a history of physical violence and acting out and a high\n\nprobability of acting out in the future. Appellant was also diagnosed with depression. He\n\nhad attempted to commit suicide by jumping out of his window while awaiting court\n\nmartial proceedings. The evaluator determined that appellant was likely to continue to be\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 23\n\na danger to himself and recommended an expeditious administrative separation because\n\nappellant’s problems were not expected to improve with available military mental-health\n\ntreatment. As a result of his pattern of misconduct while in the military and the diagnosis\n\nof a personality disorder, appellant received an other-than-honorable discharge from the\n\nMarines.\n\n       A police officer testified that, within a month of appellant’s discharge from the\n\nMarines, he was arrested for unlawful carrying of a weapon and possession of marijuana.\n\nAppellant’s probation officer testified that appellant pleaded guilty to the weapon charge\n\nand received a nine-month term of deferred-adjudication probation, and the State asked\n\nthe court to dismiss the marijuana charge. During the probation department’s intake\n\nprocess, appellant reported that he began using drugs when he was twelve years old and\n\nthat he used marijuana on a daily basis. He also completed two testing instruments\n\ndesigned to assess whether he had substance dependence problems that merited treatment.\n\nThe results of these assessments indicated serious drug and alcohol problems. Appellant\n\nwas arrested for public intoxication approximately three months after he received\n\ndeferred-adjudication probation. A motion to revoke was filed, but the revocation\n\nwarrant was not served until after appellant’s arrest for the instant offense.\n\n       The police officer who arrested appellant for public intoxication testified that\n\nwhile he was searching for two people who were seen running from the scene of a\n\ndisturbance, he found appellant crouched down on the back patio of a private residence.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 24\n\nAppellant, although drunk, was initially cooperative and polite, but he started “running\n\nhis mouth” while being handcuffed. He tried to pull away from the officer as they were\n\nwalking out of the yard. When the officer swept appellant’s legs out from under him,\n\nappellant became cooperative again. He told the officer that he was recovering from a\n\ngunshot wound.\n\n       The police officer who interviewed appellant at the hospital when appellant was\n\nthe victim of a shooting testified that he was drunk and uncooperative. Appellant had\n\nsustained two gunshot wounds, but he refused to answer any questions and said that he\n\ndid not want to get his friends involved. The officer thought that appellant was probably\n\nhiding something because it was unusual for someone with such serious injuries to refuse\n\nto talk to a police officer. She testified that in her opinion, appellant was not peaceable\n\nand law-abiding.\n\n       Appellant’s father testified in mitigation. After this testimony, counsel informed\n\nthe court outside of the presence of jury that appellant had instructed him not to call any\n\nmore witnesses. Appellant testified and confirmed that he did not want to present any\n\nmore witnesses. The expert witness whom counsel had intended to call in mitigation\n\ntestified that he had spoken with appellant about this decision and believed that appellant\n\nwas competent and was making a considered decision.\n\n       In accordance with appellant’s instructions, defense counsel made the following\n\nclosing argument:\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 25\n\n       May it please the Court and Counsel for the State and ladies and gentlemen\n       of the jury, I’m reading from the Holy Bible, the New International\n       [V]ersion, Psalm 51, verse 3. “For I know my transgressions and my sin is\n       always before me. Amen.”\n\n       Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that appellant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society. The circumstances of\n\nthe offense, appellant’s behavioral and substance-abuse problems, and his lack of regard\n\nfor authority and the law established future dangerousness. A rational trier of fact could\n\nview the instant offense as an escalation of appellant’s behavioral problems and an\n\nexample of the lengths to which he would go to support his substance-abuse habits.\n\nSimilarly, in view of the fact that appellant’s conduct had continued to deteriorate in spite\n\nof disciplinary action and criminal convictions, a rational trier of fact could determine that\n\nappellant was incorrigible, despite his young age at the time of the offense. Based on all\n\nof the evidence presented at the guilt and punishment phases, a rational trier of fact could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society. Point of error\n\nthree is overruled.\n\n       In his fourth point of error, appellant claims that the evidence is factually\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s affirmative finding of future dangerousness. We have\n\nrepeatedly held that we will not conduct a factual sufficiency review of the jury’s\n\nfuture-dangerousness determination. See McGinn v. State, 961 S.W.2d 161, 169 (Tex.\n\f                                                                                       Ramirez - 26\n\nCrim. App. 1998); see also Williams v. State, 270 S.W.3d 112, 138 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2008) (“We do not apply a factual-sufficiency review to the jury’s answer to the\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue”). More importantly, we have overruled the decision\n\nupon which appellant’s claim relies. See Martinez, 327 S.W.3d at 736. Point of error\n\nfour is overruled.\n\n                            EXTRANEOUS OFFENSE EVIDENCE\n\n       In his fifth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nevidence of the subsequent aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery at the\n\nguilt phase. He appears to assert that the parties and the court understood before trial that\n\nthis evidence would be admitted at the punishment phase only, and so introducing and\n\nadmitting this evidence at the guilt phase constituted a Rule 404(b) notice violation. See\n\nT EX. R. E VID. 404(b).8 He also argues that this evidence was inadmissible character\n\nevidence under Rule 404(b) because the State did not need it in order to prove a common\n\nscheme or plan to rob Castro. He argues further that this evidence was inadmissible\n\nunder Rule 403 because it was more prejudicial than probative.\n\n                                      A. Rule 404(b) Notice\n\n       The record shows that appellant filed a general discovery motion that included a\n\nrequest under Rule 404(b) for notice of the State’s intent to introduce, in its case-in-chief,\n\nevidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts not arising in the same transaction as the\n\n\n\n       8\n           Unless otherwise indicated all references to Rules refer to the Rules of Evidence.\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 27\n\noffense charged.” This request was granted during a hearing on October 3, 2008. At that\n\ntime, the indictment in four counts charged appellant with four offenses: the instant\n\ncapital-murder offense, the subsequent aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated\n\nrobbery, and evading arrest with a vehicle. The prosecutor presented the testimony of the\n\nvictims of the subsequent robberies at this hearing. He also explained that he did not\n\nexpect to have any evidence requiring Rule 404(b) notice because the offenses he wanted\n\nto introduce were already alleged in the indictment.\n\n       Defense counsel later filed a motion to sever the capital-murder charge from the\n\nother counts of the indictment. That motion was granted during a hearing on October 21,\n\n2008. At the hearing, defense counsel explained that he was requesting the severance\n\nbecause he had become concerned about the potential adverse effects of exposing\n\nveniremembers to allegations of multiple offenses during jury selection. The prosecutor\n\nthen explained that he still intended to introduce evidence of the subsequent offenses at\n\nthe guilt phase, and that he did not believe that the severance would keep out such\n\nevidence:\n\n       [STATE]:           [P]reviously we had a . . . discovery motion, it’s a 404(b)\n                          motion, and I want to make sure and I think Defense Counsel\n                          has already reiterated that, that I – even though the counts are\n                          severed, the State still intends to bring the evidence from\n                          Count[s] 2, 3 and 4 into the case in chief as – as the same\n                          transactional context or res gestae of the offense, and I believe\n                          [defense counsel] has already told us at a previous hearing that\n                          he had no objection to that, . . . and he is not going to object to\n                          the introduction of that even though the jury will not be charged\n                          on that; is that correct?\n\f                                                                     Ramirez - 28\n\n[DEFENSE]:   At punishment, you mean.\n\n[STATE]:     No, sir, I’m talking about in [the] case in chief we have –\n             they’re charged with one crime of . . . capital murder. The State\n             is intending since these incidents all happened right at the same\n             time that we do intend to introduce that evidence into the case\n             in chief.\n\nTHE COURT:   As a 404(b).\n\n[DEFENSE]:   As an extraneous offense and I don’t really think I need to\n             argue that. That’s clearly going to be admissible in that regard.\n\nTHE COURT:   Well, at least you’ve given him notice and he can fight about it.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   We have notice, Judge, and then we can still – we can still\n             lodge whatever objections we feel are necessary to protect the\n             record –\n\nTHE COURT:   Sure.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   – and our client’s best interest in the matter but . . . I think what\n             [the prosecutor] is trying to say or establish is that I have\n             already waived some sort of objection to that?\n\n[STATE]:     No, what I meant was it was understood since all the cases were\n             going to be tried together all that evidence was going to come\n             [in] together.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   Oh, I understand.\n\n[STATE]:     I want the Defense Counsel to know that – and the Defendant to\n             know that just because he’s going to have a Jury Charge on\n             capital murder, that’s not to say that other evidence is still going\n             to come in [sic]. He’s not going to be able to limit just to the\n             killing of Pablo Castro. The State . . . intends to introduce that\n             evidence of Count 2, Count 3 and Count 4 in the case in chief.\n\f                                                                    Ramirez - 29\n\nTHE COURT:   And so basically what he’s saying is he’s going to try to move\n             this in 404(b) and you just need to know that because you’ve\n             asked for notice –\n\n[DEFENSE]:   That’s correct.\n\nTHE COURT:   – and I think the other point is that even if the Court doesn’t\n             allow it in on 404(b) I – if he gets convicted of capital murder –\n\n[STATE]:     It would come in.\n\nTHE COURT:   – he certainly gets to prove it up.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   I understand.\n\nTHE COURT:   Okay.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   And, of course, if he doesn’t get it in under 404(b) he’ll get it in\n             under 37.07.\n\nTHE COURT:   Yeah.\n\n[STATE]:     I just want to make sure, . . . Counsel and the client have\n             discussed the fact that just because he’s limi[t]ing what he’s\n             going to be charged with that may not limit the evidence that’s\n             going to be presented.\n\n             In other words, I don’t intend to introduce evidence of just the\n             capital murder case, I intend to introduce all that evidence in\n             the case in chief so I believe it would be coming in anyway,\n             whether he severs it or not.\n\nTHE COURT:   Okay.\n\n[STATE]:     Has [defense counsel] conveyed that to his client and his client\n             fully understands that?\n\n[DEFENSE]:   I have, Your Honor.\n\n                               ***\n\f                                                                                       Ramirez - 30\n\n       THE COURT:            And you are aware that . . . I don’t know what this Court is\n                             going to do at this point, I’ll have to wait and have a hearing on\n                             the issue but it may very well be that . . . the evidence may\n                             come before the jury in the case in chief, and if not then,\n                             certainly at punishment.\n\n                             You understand that?\n\n       [DEFENDANT]: Yes, I understand that, Your Honor.\n\n       In this colloquy, defense counsel plainly stated that he understood that the State\n\nstill intended to introduce evidence of the subsequent offenses during the presentation of\n\nits case in chief at the guilt phase. Appellant failed to preserve this matter for appellate\n\nreview because he did not challenge the prosecutor’s representations at the admissibility\n\nhearing that the State’s notice to the defense was adequate, and he did not object at trial\n\nthat the defense did not have adequate notice of the State’s intent to introduce evidence of\n\nextraneous offenses.\n\n                              B. Rule 404(b) Character Evidence\n\n       The hearing on the admissibility of this evidence was held on October 29, 2008.9\n\nIn the first part of that hearing, the State presented evidence of the offense of evading\n\narrest with a vehicle. Next, the prosecutor argued that the evidence of the aggravated\n\nrobbery, attempted aggravated robbery, and evading arrest should come in as same-\n\ntransaction contextual evidence or as extraneous-offense evidence tending to show\n\n\n       9\n          At the beginning of the hearing, the trial court announced, “We are here for two\nreasons. One, we were going to talk about the [jury] list, . . . we’ll do that in a little bit. . . .\nWe’re also here because [the prosecutor] intended to introduce extraneous offenses, 404(b) at the\ntime of trial, as I understand it.”\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 31\n\nmotive, intent, plan, preparation, identity, “and such.” He asserted that the aggravated\n\nrobbery and attempted aggravated robbery offenses showed appellant’s intent to rob\n\nCastro, and that the evading arrest offense was evidence of flight that demonstrated a\n\nconsciousness of guilt.\n\n       At this hearing, defense counsel did not challenge the admissibility of the\n\nextraneous-offense evidence under Rule 404(b), but instead argued that evidence of the\n\nrobbery and attempted robbery offenses should not be admitted because such evidence\n\nwould be more prejudicial than probative under Rule 403. Counsel acknowledged that\n\nthe State sought to introduce evidence of these offenses to show appellant’s intent to rob\n\nCastro in the instant case, but he argued that allowing the State to introduce this evidence\n\nwould provide a “back door” means of prejudicing the defense. The prosecutor\n\nresponded that appellant’s intent to commit robbery was an element of the charged\n\noffense that the State had to prove, and so the evidence was admissible on that basis. See,\n\ne.g., Johnson v. State, 68 S.W.3d 644, 650 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (evidence of\n\nextraneous offenses that tended to establish robbery element of capital murder was\n\nadmissible). The trial court then ruled that these offenses were admissible because they\n\nwere “very close in time, same evening, same motives, operandi.”\n\n       Defense counsel responded that he might “reurge [his] motion” when the issue\n\ncame up at trial in order to preserve error. However, we have not found any motions\n\nchallenging the admissibility of this evidence. Nor have we found any reference during\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 32\n\nthe trial to such a motion, or any objection referring to the admissibility of extraneous\n\noffenses or unduly prejudicial evidence, and appellant does not direct us to any. See T EX.\n\nR. A PP. P. 38.1(i); Roberts v. State, 220 S.W.3d 521, 527 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (a party\n\nhas an obligation to make appropriate citations to the record in support of his argument,\n\nand an appellant procedurally defaults error by failing to include a matter in the record\n\nnecessary to evaluate his claim).\n\n       Appellant’s complaint that this evidence was not admissible under Rule 404(b) is\n\nnot preserved because appellant never objected on this basis. See Montgomery v. State,\n\n810 S.W.2d 372, 387 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (in order to preserve error on appeal, the\n\nopponent of evidence of other offenses must timely object, preferably by stating that such\n\nevidence is inadmissible under Rule 404(b), but ordinarily an objection that such evidence\n\nis not relevant or constitutes an extraneous offense is sufficient). The Rule 404(b)\n\ndiscovery motion, filed before the counts in the indictment were severed, was part of a\n\ngeneral motion for discovery and was limited to requesting notice; it did not purport to\n\nchallenge the admissibility of any evidence. See Cook v. State, 858 S.W.2d 467, 474\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (when the complaint on appeal differs from that made at trial, the\n\nerror is waived, and an objection stating one legal basis may not be used to support a\n\ndifferent legal basis on appeal). Appellant does not refer us to any motion or objection\n\nchallenging the admissibility of extraneous-offense evidence. Moreover, the evidence\n\nwas admissible.\n\f                                                                                       Ramirez - 33\n\n                                           C. Rule 403\n\n       Appellant’s complaint that the trial court erred by overruling his objection to this\n\nevidence under Rule 403 fails on the merits.10 Rule 403 provides that evidence, although\n\nrelevant, may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, by considerations of\n\nundue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. Solomon, 49 S.W.3d at\n\n366 & n.26. In making this determination, a trial court must balance:\n\n       (1) the inherent probative force of the proffered item of evidence along with\n       (2) the proponent’s need for that evidence against (3) any tendency of the\n       evidence to suggest decision on an improper basis, (4) any tendency of the\n       evidence to confuse or distract the jury from the main issues, (5) any\n       tendency of the evidence to be given undue weight by a jury that has not\n       been equipped to evaluate the probative force of the evidence, and (6) the\n       likelihood that presentation of the evidence will consume an inordinate\n       amount of time or merely repeat evidence already admitted.\n\nGigliobianco v. State, 210 S.W.3d 637, 641-42 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). These factors\n\nmay blend together in practice. Id. at 642.\n\n       The balance between the probative value and the countervailing factors set out in\n\nRule 403 is slanted toward the admission of relevant evidence. De La Paz v. State, 279\n\nS.W.3d 336, 343 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). As long as the trial court’s ruling is within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement, there is no abuse of discretion and the ruling will be\n\n\n       10\n          The trial court’s overruling of appellant’s Rule 403 objection during the pretrial\nadmissibility hearing was sufficient to preserve this claim for appeal, so long as appellant did not\naffirmatively waive the claim during trial. See Moraguez v. State, 701 S.W.2d 902, 904 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1986). The State does not argue, and our review of the record does not reveal, that\nappellant waived this claim.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 34\n\nupheld. Id. at 343-44. Further, if the trial court’s evidentiary ruling is correct under any\n\napplicable theory of law, it will not be disturbed even if the court gave a wrong or\n\ninsufficient reason for the ruling. Sewell v. State, 629 S.W.2d 42, 45 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1982).\n\n         In this case, the extraneous-offense evidence was highly probative because it made\n\nfacts of consequence more likely. See Johnson, 68 S.W.3d at 650-52. First, it made the\n\nfact of appellant’s identity as the murderer more likely. See id. at 651. At trial, appellant\n\nplaced his identity in issue when he cross-examined Cervantes, pointing out that the\n\npolice report of Cervantes’s statement did not mention that Cervantes recognized Castro’s\n\nassailant, and questioning Cervantes about his nearsightedness, the distance from the car\n\nwash to the Times Market parking lot, and the brief opportunity he had to observe the\n\nsuspects. Appellant also cross-examined Butt about whether he had seen appellant\n\nmoving his arm in a stabbing motion, emphasizing that Butt recalled “a punching motion”\n\nbut not “any stabbing movements.” He raised the possibility that Rodriguez was the\n\nmurderer when he cross-examined Chavez about whether she saw Rodriguez stabbing\n\nCastro, and he questioned the medical examiner about whether more than one knife might\n\nhave been used.\n\n         Additionally, the subsequent offenses were similar to the charged offense. See\n\nJohnson, 68 S.W.3d at 650-51. In the subsequent offenses, a female accomplice\n\ndistracted the victim so that appellant could approach from behind with a knife that he\n\f                                                                                          Ramirez - 35\n\nheld to the victim’s throat while demanding money. In the charged offense, a female\n\naccomplice approached Castro and spoke with him before appellant attacked him.\n\nCastro’s throat was slashed and cut multiple times, and his money was taken. The victims\n\nof the subsequent offenses gave descriptions of the suspects, knife, and vehicle that were\n\nsimilar to those given by witnesses to the charged offense.11 Particularly in view of their\n\nclose timing and proximity to the charged offense, these offenses were relevant to show\n\nappellant’s identity as the murderer.\n\n        Second, this evidence made the fact of appellant’s intent to rob Castro more likely.\n\nSee De La Paz, 279 S.W.3d at 349. To establish the “murder in the course of robbery”\n\ntheory of capital murder, the State was required to show that the murder was committed\n\nduring the course of the theft rather than the theft being an afterthought. See Johnson, 68\n\nS.W.3d at 650. This evidence placed the charged offense in the context of the scheme\n\ncarried out that night and tended to establish a conspiracy between appellant and his\n\n\n\n\n        11\n            Appellant now asserts that the testimony of the victims of the subsequent offenses\n“raised the emotional level of the trial” and therefore suggested a decision on an improper basis.\nHowever, he did not object to this specific testimony before or during trial. Although the victims\ntestified at a pretrial hearing and appellant had notice that they would testify at trial, appellant did\nnot single out their testimony as being unduly prejudicial at any time before or during trial, and\nthe trial court was not required to sua sponte sift through the evidence. See, e.g., Roberts, 220\nS.W.3d at 532 (attack on victim-impact testimony in general, advanced before any testimony was\nheard, did not place the trial court on notice that appellant would find particular testimony\nobjectionable); Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 572 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (trial court was not\nrequired, in the face of a global hearsay objection, to sift through an exhibit and segregate the\nadmissible portions from the inadmissible portions).\n\f                                                                                     Ramirez - 36\n\naccomplices. See, e.g., id. at 651.12 Appellant challenged his involvement in the\n\nunderlying robbery offense by cross-examining Cervantes about whether he recalled\n\nseeing anyone going through Castro’s pockets and raising the possibility that the police\n\nhad suggested this detail to Cervantes while they were taking his statement. In closing\n\nargument, appellant did not deny that he murdered Castro, but he argued that he did not\n\nplan or intend to rob Castro and that he murdered Castro because of something else that\n\ntranspired in the parking lot. At the charge conference, appellant requested and received\n\na jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of murder. In light of the State’s burden\n\nof proof and the matters placed in issue by the defense, the probative value of this\n\nevidence was not substantially outweighed by any prejudice it may have caused.\n\n       We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this\n\nevidence was admissible under Rule 403. Point of error five is overruled.\n\n                        JURY INSTRUCTIONS AT PUNISHMENT\n\n       In his sixth point of error, appellant complains of “egregious error in the\n\ninstructions to the jury at punishment,” in that the jurors were not told what to do if they\n\ncould not agree on the answer to the first special issue. Appellant does not complain\n\n\n       12\n           Appellant now argues that the State did not need this evidence to show that he and his\naccomplices had a common scheme or plan because the State had Chavez’s “unassailed”\ntestimony to that effect. However, Chavez’s testimony could not sustain a conviction unless it\nwas corroborated by other evidence tending to connect appellant with the offense. Art. 38.14;\nSolomon, 49 S.W.3d at 361. Further, Chavez acknowledged at trial that the terms of her plea\nagreement with the State required her to testify against appellant. During cross-examination,\ndefense counsel challenged her credibility by implying that if her testimony minimizing her role\nin the offenses was true, then her sentences of twenty-five years were excessive.\n\f                                                                                      Ramirez - 37\n\nabout the written jury instructions, which were correct. Rather, appellant’s specific\n\ncomplaint is that the trial judge misread the written jury instructions pertaining to the first\n\nspecial issue.\n\n       The record shows that the trial court prefaced the reading of the jury instructions as\n\nfollows:\n\n       All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are at the point where once again I read\n       you the Charge and the lawyers will argue the case to you.[13]\n\nImmediately before the challenged misreading, the court read:\n\n       “The burden of proof in Special Issue No. 1 rests upon the State, and it must\n       prove the affirmative of such issue beyond a reasonable doubt.[14]\n\n       “You are instructed that you may not answer Special Issue No. 1 ‘Yes’\n       unless all of the jurors agree to such answer. Further, you may not answer\n\n\n       13\n          Before reading the instructions at the guilt phase, the trial court gave a more extensive\nexplanation of this process as follows:\n\n       All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we are at the point at the trial where\n       I’m going to read the Charge to you, that is, for those of you that have been on the\n       jury before you know what this is. This is basically like your instruction booklet.\n       I’m going to read the Charge to you. You do not have to memorize what I’m\n       saying because you’re going to get to take this back with you. This is all the\n       instructions you’re going to get, and then after I read the Charge to you, then the\n       lawyers will argue the case to you.\n\nThis explanation made it clear that the written instructions were the jury instructions to be relied\nupon during deliberations. Nothing in the record suggests that the jurors attached more\nsignificance to the reading of the instructions at the punishment phase than they had at the guilt\nphase. Indeed, the court’s explanation at the punishment phase – “we are at the point where once\nagain I read you the Charge” – was a reference back to the process the court followed at the guilt\nphase.\n       14\n          The transcript includes quotation marks to indicate that the court was reading directly\nfrom a written source.\n\f                                                                                        Ramirez - 38\n\n       this Special Issue No. – Special Issue ‘No’ unless ten (10) or more jurors\n       agree. It is not necessary that members of the jury agree on what particular\n       evidence supports a negative answer, that is, an answer of ‘No’ to Special\n       Issue No. 1.”\n\n       Special Issue No. 1, with forms for answers, is as follows:\n\n       “Special Issue No. 1. Is there a probability that the Defendant, John Henry\n       Ramirez, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute\n       a contributory [sic] threat to society?”[15] And there’s a place for answers,\n       and I’ll read them to you.\n\n       “Answer: We, the jury, unanimously find and determine beyond a\n       reasonable doubt that the answer to Special Issue is – to this Special Issue is\n       ‘Yes,’” and there’s a place for the presiding juror to sign, or, “We the jury,\n       because of – because at least ten (10) jurors have a reasonable doubt as to\n       the probability that Defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that\n       would constitute a continuing threat to society, determine that the answer to\n       this Special Issue No. 1 is ‘No,’” and there’s a place for the presiding juror\n       to sign.\n\nThen, as appellant points out, the court misread the following instruction:\n\n       “In the event that the jury is unable to agree upon Special Issue No. 2\n       (sic)[16] under the conditions and instructions outlined above, the Presiding\n       Juror will not sign either form of answer to Special – of this Special Issue.”\n\nThe court then continued reading:\n\n       “You are further instructed that if the jury makes an affirmative finding to\n       Special Issue No. 1, that is, an answer of ‘Yes,’ then the jury shall answer\n       Special Issue No. 2 below.”\n\n\n\n\n       15\n           Appellant does not challenge this particular misreading. The written jury instruction\ncorrectly contained the phrase “continuing threat” rather than “contributory threat.”\n       16\n          The “(sic)” at this point is part of the transcript. It constitutes some evidence that the\ncourt reporter understood that the trial court made a mistake by saying, “Special Issue No. 2.”\n\f                                                                                   Ramirez - 39\n\n       Appellant argues that this misreading of the instructions, in which the trial court\n\nsaid, “Special Issue No. 2,” instead of, “Special Issue No. 1,” effectively failed to tell the\n\njurors what to do if they could not agree on the first special issue. He asserts that this\n\nerror violated the federal constitution’s due process guarantee and the state constitution’s\n\ndue course of law provisions.17 He acknowledges that there was no objection, but he\n\nclaims that the harm is egregious because, if the jury had not been able to agree, the court\n\nwould have imposed a life sentence. “Without direction, they agreed upon an answer that\n\nprompted a death sentence. The error was, consequently, not harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.”\n\n       We question appellant’s characterization of the misreading as jury-charge error\n\nbecause the written jury instruction was correct. At worst, any uncertainty over whether\n\nthe verbal misreading or the correct written instruction was authoritative might have\n\ncreated an ambiguity. However, it is not necessary to resolve this matter because even if\n\nwe assume arguendo that the misreading constituted jury charge error or created an\n\nambiguity, appellant cannot show that he was harmed.\n\n       If no objection to an alleged jury charge error was made at trial, the appellant must\n\nshow that the error created such harm that he did not have a fair and impartial trial.\n\nAlmanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985). Error creating egregious\n\n\n\n       17\n           Appellant makes no distinction between his rights under the federal and Texas\nconstitutions. Therefore we will treat them as being the same. See Luquis v. State, 72 S.W.3d\n355, 364 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\f                                                                                   Ramirez - 40\n\nharm is also described as error that goes to the very basis of the case or that vitally affects\n\nthe defensive theory. Ex parte Smith, 309 S.W.3d 53, 63 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). The\n\nactual degree of harm must be assayed in light of the entire jury charge, the state of the\n\nevidence, the argument of counsel, and any other relevant information revealed by the\n\nrecord of the trial as a whole. Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171.\n\n       Jury instructions which are not legally erroneous, but which might be ambiguous\n\nand therefore subject to an erroneous interpretation or application, are reviewed to\n\ndetermine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that they were applied in an erroneous\n\nway. Luquis v. State, 72 S.W.3d 355, 367 & n.37 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). The\n\nreviewing court should use common sense in determining if there is a reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the jury was misled. Mireles v. State, 901 S.W.2d 458, 460 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1995). “A single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but\n\nmust be viewed in the context of the overall charge.” Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370,\n\n378 (1990); see also Saffel v. State, 121 Tex. Crim. 444, 451-52 (Tex. Crim. App. 1932)\n\n(on motion for reh’g) (omission of the word “not” from one part of the jury charge was\n\nnot reversible error where an intelligent mind, considering the charge in its entirety,\n\nwould supply the missing word).\n\n       In this case, the trial judge plainly stated that he was reading the written jury\n\ninstructions and forms. In doing so, he indicated to the jury that the written instructions\n\nwere authoritative. After the parties made their closing arguments, the written\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 41\n\ninstructions and forms were given to the jurors during deliberations. The written portion\n\nthat correctly stated, “In the event that the jury is unable to agree upon Special Issue No.\n\n1, . . . the Presiding Juror will not sign either form of answer,” immediately followed the\n\nforms that were to be completed by the presiding juror. The presiding juror signed the\n\nform indicating that the jury unanimously found that the answer to Special Issue No. 1\n\nwas “Yes.”\n\n       On these facts, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was confused or\n\nmisled by any alleged error or ambiguity. The context makes clear that the trial court\n\nsimply misread one word of the written jury instruction. The court referred to “Special\n\nIssue No. 1” six times before incorrectly referring to “Special Issue No. 2,” and then the\n\ncourt referred again to “Special Issue No. 1” while reading the language that instructed\n\nthe jury on what to do in the event of an affirmative finding.\n\n       Finally, the misread instruction did not concern the jury’s ability to agree or\n\ndisagree on any special issue. The plain language of this instruction concerned only the\n\npresiding juror’s conduct, directing him not to sign the forms in the event that the jury\n\ncould not agree under the outlined conditions. Appellant does not argue, and there is no\n\nevidence, that the court’s misreading so confused the presiding juror, who had the\n\ncorrectly worded written jury instruction before him during deliberations, that he felt\n\ncompelled to sign the forms even if the jurors did not agree.\n\f                                                                             Ramirez - 42\n\n      The record does not reveal any reasonable likelihood that the jurors were misled or\n\nconfused by the challenged misreading. Point of error six is overruled.\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Meyers, J.\n\n\n\n\nDelivered: March 16, 2011\nDo Not Publish\n\f",

T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\nA NN. § 19.03(a)(2). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in the\n\nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 37.071, Sections 2(b) and 2(e), the trial judge\n\f                                                                                     Ramirez - 2\n\nsentenced appellant to death. Art. 37.071, § 2(g).1 Direct appeal to this Court is\n\nautomatic. Art. 37.071, § 2(h). After reviewing appellant’s six points of error, we find\n\nthem to be without merit. Consequently, we affirm the trial court’s judgment and\n\nsentence of death.\n\n                                  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Appellant was charged with intentionally causing the death of Pablo Castro by\n\nstabbing him with a knife while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the\n\noffense of robbery. Lydia Salinas testified that she had known Castro for ten to fifteen\n\nyears. She was the manager and cashier of Times Market, the convenience store where\n\nCastro worked, and they regularly worked the night shift together. Castro would come to\n\nwork around 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m., and Salinas would arrive at 6:00 p.m. They worked\n\nuntil the store closed at midnight, and they usually took turns buying dinner. On the night\n\nof July 19, 2004, Castro told Salinas that he had only a dollar, so she bought them both\n\ndinner. Salinas’s sister-in-law brought it to the store for them. She told Salinas that there\n\nwas a van parked in the area where she usually parked. After she left, Salinas and Castro\n\nfinished eating. A short time later, a young Hispanic woman came into the store to use\n\nthe bathroom. Salinas remembered her because she asked to use the “facilities,” which\n\nwas unusual. Salinas later identified the woman as Angela Rodriguez.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Unless otherwise indicated all references to Articles refer to the Code of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 3\n\n       As closing time approached, Castro told Salinas that he was going out to empty the\n\ntrash. Salinas was busy counting money at the cash register. A few minutes later, a girl\n\ncame in and told her that there was a bleeding man lying in the parking lot. Salinas\n\nthought that Castro had probably come back inside by then and was working in the back\n\nof the store, so she called out to let him know that she was going outside. She stepped\n\noutside and confirmed that someone was lying in the parking lot, and then she went back\n\nin and called 9-1-1. She yelled for Castro to come to the front of the store before she\n\nwent back outside to see if she could help. She took a closer look at the man in the\n\nparking lot and realized that he was Castro. She screamed and started toward him, but a\n\nneighbor and some people who had come from the car wash next door held her back and\n\ntold her that he was dead.\n\n       Mariano Cervantes testified that he and Kashif Butt worked together at another\n\nstore that closed at 11:00 p.m. After they closed up their store for the night, they drove to\n\nthe car wash located next to Times Market. As they were getting ready to wash their cars,\n\nButt called Cervantes’s attention to a fight that was going on in the Times Market parking\n\nlot. Cervantes saw a young man and woman standing on either side of an “older\n\ngentleman” and hitting him. The older man looked like he was trying to get out of the\n\nway. Cervantes testified that he recognized the young man because they had gone to the\n\nsame school, but he did not recognize the woman. Cervantes and Butt started toward the\n\nparking lot to see if they could help the older man. Cervantes saw the older man fall, and\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 4\n\nhe saw the young man and woman get into two separate vans. He did not see anyone\n\nreach into the victim’s pockets. The assailants were gone by the time he reached the\n\nvictim. Cervantes had not seen a knife during the fight, but when the victim tilted his\n\nhead back, Cervantes could see a large bloody gash on his throat. The victim was\n\nconscious when Cervantes first tried to talk to him, but he was gurgling and spitting out\n\nblood, and soon he closed his eyes and stopped responding. Cervantes believed he was\n\ndead.\n\n        After reviewing his statement to police, Cervantes acknowledged that he had told\n\npolice that he saw the woman trying to reach into the victim’s pockets. He also\n\nacknowledged that his statement did not include the information that he recognized the\n\nman who attacked the victim. He further acknowledged that he was not able to positively\n\nidentify Rodriguez when police officers took him to see her later that evening. He\n\nrecalled saying that the person they showed him looked like her but that he was not “a\n\nhundred percent sure.”\n\n        Kashif Butt testified that, after work, he and Cervantes went to the car wash next\n\nto Times Market. They were about to start washing their cars when Butt heard sounds of\n\narguing or fighting coming from the store parking lot. He saw the victim being beaten up\n\nby a man and woman. He did not see a weapon. He described the assailants as being\n\nabout 5' 6\" tall and Hispanic. The man was “built,” and the woman was skinny. The\n\nvictim was about 5' 6\", in his 40’s, and heavy. The assailants were punching and kicking\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 5\n\nhim, and the victim was trying to block their punches and kicks. After he fell, the\n\nassailants kept beating him and kicking him. Eventually they stopped and went through\n\nhis pockets, got something out, and then left. Butt saw them get into a big red Ford van.\n\nA third person was sitting in the driver’s seat. Upon reviewing his statement to police,\n\nButt remembered that there was a second van, but he still recalled that both assailants got\n\ninto the van with the waiting driver. He did not recall what happened to the second van.\n\nThe victim was barely alive when Butt and Cervantes reached him. Butt saw that the\n\nvictim was bleeding badly from his throat.\n\n       On cross-examination, Butt acknowledged that he did not see the man and woman\n\nusing any motions that he would describe as “stabbing movements,” but instead he saw\n\nmotions that he described as “straight punch[es] or side punches.” He said that he was\n\npretty sure that both the man and the woman went through the victim’s pockets and took\n\nsomething. He reiterated that he did not know what happened to the second van.\n\n       Officer Mike Wenzel, who responded first to Salinas’s 9-1-1 call, testified that\n\nwhen he arrived at Times Market, the victim was lying in a pool of blood. He had been\n\nstabbed in the neck and his throat had been slashed. His wounds were consistent with\n\nknife wounds. He was not breathing or bleeding, and Wenzel concluded that he was\n\ndead. Wenzel tried to secure the scene while he waited for additional officers to arrive.\n\nHe spoke with Salinas, Cervantes, and Butt, and learned that the suspects were both about\n\n5'8\" and wearing blue jeans and T-shirts. The woman was slim and between 20 and 30\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 6\n\nyears old. The suspects had fled in two red full-size conversion vans, with the woman\n\ngetting into the passenger side of one van and the man getting into the driver’s side of the\n\nother van. Wenzel gave this information to the police dispatcher, who issued an alert to\n\nall the officers in the city to be on the lookout for the suspects’ vehicles.\n\n       Christina Chavez, one of appellant’s accomplices, testified that, at the time of the\n\noffense, she and Angela Rodriguez lived together in San Antonio, but they had traveled to\n\nCorpus Christi to visit Rodriguez’s family for the weekend. Rodriguez knew appellant,\n\nand the three of them drank and used drugs together for three or four days. When\n\nappellant came to Rodriguez’s mother’s house, Rodriguez snuck him in because her\n\nmother did not want him there. He was showing off a ridged knife. Rodriguez’s mother\n\nkicked him out of her house when she discovered him, but he came back later that day\n\nwith Rodriguez’s sister, Roberta Garcia. Chavez, Rodriguez, and appellant left Garcia at\n\nher mother’s house when they went out again. They pawned some things for drug money.\n\nLater, they went to appellant’s friend’s house where they used more drugs until they ran\n\nout. Chavez testified that in order to obtain money for more drugs, they agreed to grab\n\nsomeone and take his or her money, but they did not plan to hurt anyone. Only appellant\n\nhad a weapon. They got into two maroon vans and started driving, searching for someone\n\nto rob. Chavez testified that she drove one van, with Rodriguez as a passenger, while\n\nappellant drove the other van. They pulled into the parking lot of Times Market where\n\nthey saw a man carrying a bag to the dumpster. Rodriguez got out of the van and spoke to\n\f                                                                                    Ramirez - 7\n\nhim, and then returned to the van. Chavez then saw that appellant was fighting with the\n\nman. She told Rodriguez, who got back out of the van to see what was going on. Chavez\n\ntestified that Rodriguez did not join in the fight but instead tried to get appellant off of the\n\nman. Appellant used the knife he had been showing off earlier to stab the man until he\n\nfell to his knees. After the man fell backward onto the ground, appellant pointed to\n\nRodriguez, and then Rodriguez went through the man’s pockets. Chavez did not see\n\nappellant go through the victim’s pockets. Although she did not see Rodriguez take\n\nanything out of the victim’s pocket, she saw Rodriguez drop $1.25 onto the console when\n\nshe got back into the van. Chavez thought that the money came from the victim’s pocket.\n\nBoth appellant and Rodriguez had blood on them, so they found a place to rinse off.\n\n       Because they still did not have money for drugs, they committed an aggravated\n\nrobbery, and then they attempted to commit another. Chavez testified that she waited in\n\nthe van while appellant and Rodriguez committed these offenses. After the aggravated\n\nrobbery, Rodriguez told Chavez to get into the van that appellant was driving, and from\n\nthen on, the group rode together in one van. As they were driving away from the\n\nattempted robbery, they were seen by police and a chase ensued, but they eluded the\n\npolice car that pursued them. They drove to an area of town known as “The Cut,” where\n\nappellant drove the van into a lot that was overgrown with bushes and tall grass. They\n\nclimbed out of the van and continued on foot. Chavez and Rodriguez were soon arrested,\n\nbut appellant escaped. Chavez did not know what happened to appellant’s knife, which\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 8\n\nwas never recovered, but she recalled that appellant told her he was keeping it as a\n\nsouvenir.\n\n       The victims of the aggravated robbery and the attempted aggravated robbery also\n\ntestified. April Metting, the aggravated-robbery victim, testified that while she was\n\nwaiting in line at the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant, a young woman\n\nwalked up to the front of her car and asked to use her cell phone. The woman said that\n\nshe had been in a fight and pointed to blood stains on her shirt. While Metting’s attention\n\nwas focused on the woman, a man came up behind her and reached into her open window\n\nwith a ridged knife. He grabbed her by the back of her neck as he held the knife to her\n\nthroat and demanded money. Metting testified that she was scared and asked them not to\n\ndo this in front of her two-year-old son, who was sitting in the back seat, but the man just\n\nsaid, “Shut up, bitch.” The woman also told her to shut up and give them her purse. She\n\ngave the man her money and her purse, and then the woman and man got into a van with\n\nanother woman and left. Metting saw two vans parked nearby in the restaurant parking\n\nlot, but the suspects left together in only one of them. She said that she learned during the\n\ninvestigation that the young woman who had asked to use her cell phone was Chavez.\n\nShe also identified a wallet and credit card that had been taken from her during the\n\nrobbery and that were recovered from inside the Ford van.\n\f                                                                                      Ramirez - 9\n\n       Ruby Pena Hinojosa,2 the victim of the attempted aggravated robbery, testified to a\n\nsimilar incident at the drive-through window of another fast-food restaurant. A maroon\n\nvan pulled up next to her, and a thin woman with long, wavy hair got out and asked to use\n\nher cell phone. While they were talking, a man appeared at her driver’s side window, put\n\na serrated knife to her neck, and demanded money, but she was able to lean away from\n\nthe knife and roll up her window. The man then went around to her passenger side\n\nwindow and began banging on the glass with the blade of his knife while his accomplice\n\npeered into her back windows. The victim feared for her life. At that point, she backed\n\nup her car and the suspects got into the van and left. She got a good look at the man’s\n\nface and she later identified appellant in a photo lineup. These offenses took place within\n\nminutes of the Times Market offense.\n\n       Garcia, Rodriguez’s sister, testified that, during the weekend leading up to the\n\noffense, she drank and did drugs with appellant, Rodriguez, and Chavez. Appellant\n\nshowed her his knife, which had ridges or teeth on the side. She was out with them\n\nearlier on the day of the offense, but appellant dropped her, Rodriguez, and Chavez off at\n\nRodriguez’s mother’s house. Later, when appellant returned to the house and picked up\n\nRodriguez and Chavez, Garcia did not go with them. The next time she saw appellant\n\nwas when he showed up at the front door after midnight, out of breath and covered in\n\ngrass and dirt. He said that they had stabbed someone and that the police were after him.\n\n       2\n         When this victim testified at trial, she was identified as “Ruby Pena Hinojosa,” but she\nwas identified in an indictment against appellant as “Ruby Pena.”\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 10\n\nHe would not tell her where Rodriguez was. At one point, he said he stabbed Rodriguez,\n\nbut at another point, he said that he thought she had gotten away. He had a big gash on\n\nhis right hand that was bleeding heavily. He ran away when Garcia told him to leave.\n\n       Pamela Smith, a forensic scientist for the Texas Department of Public Safety,\n\ntestified that DNA test results of samples taken from blood on the driver’s-side door\n\nhandle, steering wheel, and passenger door pocket of the Ford van that was recovered\n\nfrom the overgrown lot were consistent with appellant’s DNA profile. Smith was able to\n\nsay with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that appellant was the source of those\n\nsamples. Samples from other items found in the van were also consistent with appellant’s\n\nDNA profile. Samples taken from blood on the steering wheel cover were consistent with\n\na mixture of appellant’s and Castro’s DNA profiles.\n\n       Smith testified further that samples taken from blood on the gear shift lever, a\n\nT-shirt, and a vodka bottle found inside the Ford van were consistent with Castro’s DNA\n\nprofile. A sample taken from blood on an armrest inside the Dodge van that had been\n\nabandoned during the second robbery was also consistent with Castro’s DNA profile.\n\nSamples from blood on the blue jean shorts Rodriguez was wearing when she was\n\narrested were consistent with Castro’s DNA profile. Smith was able to say with a\n\nreasonable degree of scientific certainty that Castro was the source of those samples.\n\n       Rey Fernandez, the medical examiner, testified about his examination and autopsy\n\nof Castro. He identified twenty-nine sharp force injuries consistent with knife wounds,\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 11\n\nten of which were stab wounds that penetrated Castro’s body and nineteen of which were\n\nincised or slash-type wounds. Eight of the injuries were defensive wounds on Castro’s\n\nright forearm and hand. The majority of the stab wounds were concentrated around\n\nCastro’s head, neck, shoulders, and back. Fernandez also observed evidence of blunt\n\nforce trauma on Castro’s face and neck, as if he had been punched or kicked. A\n\ntoxicology screen detected no alcohol or illegal drugs in Castro’s body.\n\n       Officer James Gray testified that as he and his partner were heading toward the\n\nscene of the attempted robbery, they passed a red van matching the general description of\n\nthe suspect vehicle. They shined a spotlight into the van and saw a man and woman in\n\nthe front. Gray identified appellant in court as the man he saw driving the van. They\n\nmade a U-turn and followed the van, turning on their lights and attempting to stop it.\n\nInitially, the driver of the van pulled over and stopped, but as soon as Gray opened the\n\ndoor of his patrol unit and stepped out, the driver of the van drove away. Gray got back\n\ninto the car and he and his partner pursued the van. They sent out a description of the\n\nvehicle, its location, and the direction it was heading. The driver of the van accelerated to\n\nspeeds of over 70 miles per hour and traveled through intersections without slowing\n\ndown, until eventually the officers lost sight of the van on the north side of town. They\n\nagain sent out information about where the van was last seen and the direction it had been\n\nheading.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 12\n\n       Officer Michael Frakes testified that he responded to a call for all available units to\n\nmove to the area of town where the vehicle pursuit was happening. He was familiar with\n\nthe Port area, which was within a mile of where the van had last been seen, so he drove to\n\nthat area to look around. While he was driving down a dark street, he saw “a red flash\n\nlike a reflector.” He shined his spotlight toward it and saw the right rear corner of a red\n\nvan that had been driven off the road into a wooded area. Aware that the suspects might\n\nbe dangerous, he turned off his spotlight and called for assistance. After another officer\n\narrived, Frakes walked up to the van and discovered that it was empty, but the engine was\n\nstill hot. Additional officers arrived to help search the area for the suspects. Frakes soon\n\nheard that another officer had arrested two women just beyond the brush where the van\n\nwas found.\n\n       Officer Ralph Vasquez testified that he heard about the pursuit of the van while it\n\nwas happening and he moved into a parallel pursuit so that he would be close at hand in\n\ncase the van broke away from the pursuing unit. After learning that the van had broken\n\naway, he responded to the call for all available units to search for it. When he learned\n\nthat the van had been found, he decided to circle around the brush area where it was\n\nlocated to see if he could find any suspects. He saw two white shapes moving, turned his\n\nheadlights toward them, and discovered two women who matched the suspects’\n\ndescriptions. He and another officer arrested them. Their clothes were soiled and bloody.\n\f                                                                                    Ramirez - 13\n\nBased on the way the women acted, Officer Vasquez believed that they were under the\n\ninfluence of a mixture of alcohol and drugs.3\n\n                            SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n       In his first point of error, appellant asserts that the evidence is legally insufficient\n\nto prove that he is guilty of capital murder. Within the body of this argument, appellant\n\nalso asserts that Chavez’s accomplice-witness testimony was not sufficiently\n\ncorroborated. Thus, this point of error raises two distinct legal theories: (1) the evidence\n\nwas legally insufficient; and (2) the conviction cannot be sustained under Article 38.14.\n\nSee Cathey v.

He refers to portions of the\nrecord in which the prosecutor chided Chavez for attempting to minimize her involvement in the\noffenses, or told her that a jury would have trouble believing her. However, these events alone\ndo not establish that Chavez committed perjury. It was for the jury, not this Court, to evaluate\nChavez’s credibility and weigh her testimony. See Wesbrook v.

State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1463524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1463524/taylor-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       As pled in the indictment, the offense of capital murder is committed when (1) a\n\nperson (2) intentionally (3) causes the death (4) of an individual (5) while in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit robbery. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 19.03(a)(2); see\n\nalso Wilkerson, 881 S.W.2d at 323. In this case, appellant does not challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence with regard to his intent to cause Castro’s death. Instead, he\n\nchallenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence with regard to whether he acted in the\n\ncourse of committing or attempting to commit robbery. However, the record contains\n\nample evidence to support the conviction.\n\n       Appellant was charged with intentionally or knowingly causing Castro’s death by\n\nstabbing him while in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. The\n\njury charge provided that appellant was criminally responsible for an offense committed\n\nby the conduct of another if, acting with intent to promote or assist in the commission of\n\f                                                                                     Ramirez - 16\n\nthe offense, he solicited, encouraged, directed, aided, or attempted to aid the other person\n\nto commit the offense. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 7.02(a)(2). Appellant now asserts that\n\nChavez’s testimony that he pointed to Rodriguez before she went through Castro’s\n\npockets is too vague to show that he solicited, encouraged, directed, aided, or attempted\n\nto aid Rodriguez to commit the offense of robbery. Therefore, he reasons, he was not\n\ncriminally responsible for the robbery committed by Rodriguez.\n\n       As an initial matter, it is not necessary to determine whether appellant could be\n\nheld criminally responsible for Rodriguez’s conduct because the record contains evidence\n\nthat appellant directly participated in the robbery. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 7.01(a) (a\n\nperson is criminally responsible if an offense is committed by his own conduct, by the\n\nconduct of another for which he is criminally responsible, or by both). An eyewitness,\n\nButt, testified that he saw both appellant and Rodriguez going through the victim’s\n\npockets. On cross-examination, Butt continued to say he was “pretty sure” that he saw\n\nboth the man and woman going through the victim’s pockets. This testimony was\n\nevidence that appellant directly participated in the robbery. See Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at\n\n111.7 Considering all the record evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\n\ndetermine that a rational trier of fact could have found appellant guilty of all the elements\n\n\n       7\n          Appellant also complains that he was not properly identified in court as the person who\ncommitted the offense. Specifically, he complains that, after Cervantes’s in-court identification\nof appellant as the young man he saw attacking the victim, the prosecutor neglected to say, “Let\nthe record reflect that this witness has identified the defendant.” However, after the in-court\nidentifications of appellant by Butt, Garcia, and other witnesses, the prosecutor did recite words\nto the effect of, “Let the record reflect that this witness has identified the defendant.”\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 17\n\nof capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt, even without the alternative theory of\n\nliability provided in section 7.02(a)(2).\n\n       Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the evidence was legally insufficient to\n\nfind appellant guilty of directly participating in the robbery, the record also contains\n\nample evidence that appellant was guilty of the underlying robbery under Penal Code §\n\n7.02(a)(2). Appellant’s act of pointing to Rodriguez was not the only evidence that he\n\nsolicited, directed, encouraged, or aided the commission of the robbery. His act of\n\nstabbing Castro encouraged and aided the commission of the robbery, and it was also\n\nevidence of appellant’s intent to commit the robbery. See Young v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1860086\"><a href=\"/opinion/1860086/young-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009) (assaultive conduct was\n\nevidence of intent to commit robbery). Additionally, Chavez’s testimony that the group\n\nwas looking for someone to rob in order to obtain drug money was evidence that, when\n\nappellant stabbed Castro, he did so in order to encourage or aid the commission of the\n\nrobbery. See, e.g., Guevara, 152 S.W.3d at 50 & n.18 (motive is a circumstance\n\nindicating guilt, and intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence). The\n\nsubsequent aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery, during which appellant\n\nused his knife in attempts to obtain drug money, provided further evidence of appellant’s\n\nguilt. The evidence is legally sufficient to show that appellant was guilty of the\n\nunderlying offense of robbery because he participated in it directly and because he was\n\ncriminally responsible for Rodriguez’s conduct.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 18\n\n                                B. Accomplice Witness Rule\n\n       We now turn to appellant’s assertion that Chavez’s testimony concerning both the\n\nmurder and the underlying offense of robbery was not sufficiently corroborated under\n\nArticle 38.14. Chavez, who pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and received a sentence\n\nof twenty-five years for her role in this offense, was an accomplice as a matter of law.\n\nSee Brown v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1590505\"><a href=\"/opinion/1590505/brown-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (accomplice as a matter\n\nof law is one who is susceptible to prosecution for the charged offense or a lesser\n\nincluded offense). The accomplice-witness rule mandates that a conviction cannot be had\n\nupon the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated by other evidence tending\n\nto connect the defendant with the offense. Art. 38.14. However, accomplice-witness\n\ntestimony in a capital murder case does not require corroboration concerning the elements\n\nof the aggravating offense, that is, the elements which distinguish murder from capital\n\nmurder. See McDuff v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448479\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448479/mcduff-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613 (Tex.

Crim. App. 1987) (no need for corroboration as to\n\nunderlying offense of robbery). Therefore, Chavez’s testimony concerning the underlying\n\noffense of robbery did not require corroboration.\n\n       Unlike legal sufficiency, the accomplice-witness rule is not derived from federal or\n\nstate constitutional principles. See Druery v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769103\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769103/druery-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2007). Therefore, “tendency to connect” rather than rational sufficiency is the\n\nstandard: the corroborating evidence need not be sufficient by itself to establish guilt.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 19\n\nCathey, 992 S.W.2d at 462. The non-accomplice evidence must simply link the accused\n\nin some way to the commission of the crime, such that rational jurors could conclude that\n\nthis evidence sufficiently tended to connect the accused to the offense.

Crim. App. 1997).\n\n       The sufficiency of the corroborating evidence is evaluated by eliminating the\n\naccomplice testimony from consideration and then examining the remaining portions of\n\nthe record for any evidence that tends to connect the accused with the commission of the\n\ncrime.

Crim. App. 2001). Proof that the\n\naccused was at or near the scene of the crime at or about the time of its commission, when\n\ncoupled with other suspicious circumstances, may tend to connect the accused to the\n\ncrime so as to furnish sufficient corroboration to support a conviction.

Crim. App. 1984). Evidence that the defendant was in the\n\ncompany of the accomplice near the time or place of the offense is also proper\n\ncorroborating evidence. McDuff, 939 S.W.2d at 613. If the combined weight of the\n\nnon-accomplice evidence tends to connect the defendant to the offense, then the\n\nrequirement of Article 38.14 has been fulfilled. Cathey, 992 S.W.2d at 462.\n\n       In this case, the following non-accomplice evidence tended to connect appellant to\n\nthe offense:\n\n       (1)     Two eyewitnesses testified that they saw a man and woman beating and\n               kicking the victim, who fell to the ground. The witnesses gave physical\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 20\n\n              descriptions of the assailants that were consistent with appellant and\n              Rodriguez. One of the witnesses recognized appellant from prior contact as\n              the man he saw attacking the victim. The man and woman left the scene in\n              red vans. When the witnesses tried to help the victim, they saw that his\n              throat had been slashed and he was bleeding heavily. He died within\n              minutes of the attack.\n\n       (2)    Rodriguez’s sister, Garcia, testified that appellant showed her a knife while\n              they drank and did drugs together. She testified that appellant and his\n              accomplices left the house together before the offense. After midnight,\n              appellant showed up at her front door and told her that they had stabbed\n              someone and the police were chasing him.\n\n       (3)    Shortly after the offense, a man and woman in a red van were observed\n              committing and attempting to commit additional robberies. The man\n              threatened the victims by holding a knife to their throats. One victim\n              identified appellant as the man who attacked her. Property belonging to the\n              other victim was found in the van.\n\n       (4)    A responding police officer identified appellant as the driver of the red van\n              that he pursued shortly after the offense. The officer described the evasive\n              maneuvers that appellant took to avoid being arrested.\n\n       (5)    A short time after the offense, a police officer observed a red van that had\n              been driven into an overgrown lot. It was empty, but the engine was still\n              hot. Appellant’s accomplices were arrested nearby. DNA testing revealed\n              that a mixture of appellant’s and Castro’s blood was on the steering wheel\n              cover.\n\n       Hence, the requirements of the accomplice-witness rule set forth in Article 38.14\n\nwere satisfied. We hold that the evidence was legally sufficient and that the accomplice-\n\nwitness testimony was sufficiently corroborated. Point of error one is overruled.\n\n                                    C.

Point of error two is overruled.\n\n            SUFFICIENCY OF FUTURE DANGEROUSNESS EVIDENCE\n\n       In his third point of error, appellant claims that the evidence is legally insufficient\n\nto support the jury’s affirmative finding of future dangerousness. In evaluating the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s answer to the future-dangerousness\n\nspecial issue, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat there is a probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence\n\nconstituting a continuing threat to society.

App. 1987). Habitual drug abuse may constitute evidence of future dangerousness.\n\nWilkerson, 881 S.W.2d at 326.\n\n       The record shows that appellant had a history of disciplinary problems, arrests, and\n\nconvictions, many of which were associated with drug and alcohol abuse. His military\n\nrecords showed that, when he was nineteen years old, he was convicted in a summary\n\ncourt martial of being absent without leave for 163 days, using disrespectful language\n\ntoward a non-commissioned officer, failing to obey a general order (underage drinking),\n\nand drunk and disorderly conduct. Pursuant to a mental-health and substance-abuse\n\nscreening, appellant was diagnosed with a personality disorder with borderline, antisocial,\n\nand dependent traits. He did not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse and had no desire for\n\ntreatment.\n\n       Appellant informed the mental-health evaluator that he had been suspended from\n\nschool at the rate of nine or more times a year, typically resulting from “disrespecting”\n\nteachers and physically fighting with other students. The mental-health evaluator\n\ndetermined that appellant had a history of physical violence and acting out and a high\n\nprobability of acting out in the future. Appellant was also diagnosed with depression. He\n\nhad attempted to commit suicide by jumping out of his window while awaiting court\n\nmartial proceedings. The evaluator determined that appellant was likely to continue to be\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 23\n\na danger to himself and recommended an expeditious administrative separation because\n\nappellant’s problems were not expected to improve with available military mental-health\n\ntreatment. As a result of his pattern of misconduct while in the military and the diagnosis\n\nof a personality disorder, appellant received an other-than-honorable discharge from the\n\nMarines.\n\n       A police officer testified that, within a month of appellant’s discharge from the\n\nMarines, he was arrested for unlawful carrying of a weapon and possession of marijuana.\n\nAppellant’s probation officer testified that appellant pleaded guilty to the weapon charge\n\nand received a nine-month term of deferred-adjudication probation, and the State asked\n\nthe court to dismiss the marijuana charge. During the probation department’s intake\n\nprocess, appellant reported that he began using drugs when he was twelve years old and\n\nthat he used marijuana on a daily basis. He also completed two testing instruments\n\ndesigned to assess whether he had substance dependence problems that merited treatment.\n\nThe results of these assessments indicated serious drug and alcohol problems. Appellant\n\nwas arrested for public intoxication approximately three months after he received\n\ndeferred-adjudication probation. A motion to revoke was filed, but the revocation\n\nwarrant was not served until after appellant’s arrest for the instant offense.\n\n       The police officer who arrested appellant for public intoxication testified that\n\nwhile he was searching for two people who were seen running from the scene of a\n\ndisturbance, he found appellant crouched down on the back patio of a private residence.\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 24\n\nAppellant, although drunk, was initially cooperative and polite, but he started “running\n\nhis mouth” while being handcuffed. He tried to pull away from the officer as they were\n\nwalking out of the yard. When the officer swept appellant’s legs out from under him,\n\nappellant became cooperative again. He told the officer that he was recovering from a\n\ngunshot wound.\n\n       The police officer who interviewed appellant at the hospital when appellant was\n\nthe victim of a shooting testified that he was drunk and uncooperative. Appellant had\n\nsustained two gunshot wounds, but he refused to answer any questions and said that he\n\ndid not want to get his friends involved. The officer thought that appellant was probably\n\nhiding something because it was unusual for someone with such serious injuries to refuse\n\nto talk to a police officer. She testified that in her opinion, appellant was not peaceable\n\nand law-abiding.\n\n       Appellant’s father testified in mitigation. After this testimony, counsel informed\n\nthe court outside of the presence of jury that appellant had instructed him not to call any\n\nmore witnesses. Appellant testified and confirmed that he did not want to present any\n\nmore witnesses. The expert witness whom counsel had intended to call in mitigation\n\ntestified that he had spoken with appellant about this decision and believed that appellant\n\nwas competent and was making a considered decision.\n\n       In accordance with appellant’s instructions, defense counsel made the following\n\nclosing argument:\n\f                                                                                  Ramirez - 25\n\n       May it please the Court and Counsel for the State and ladies and gentlemen\n       of the jury, I’m reading from the Holy Bible, the New International\n       [V]ersion, Psalm 51, verse 3. “For I know my transgressions and my sin is\n       always before me. Amen.”\n\n       Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that appellant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society. The circumstances of\n\nthe offense, appellant’s behavioral and substance-abuse problems, and his lack of regard\n\nfor authority and the law established future dangerousness. A rational trier of fact could\n\nview the instant offense as an escalation of appellant’s behavioral problems and an\n\nexample of the lengths to which he would go to support his substance-abuse habits.\n\nSimilarly, in view of the fact that appellant’s conduct had continued to deteriorate in spite\n\nof disciplinary action and criminal convictions, a rational trier of fact could determine that\n\nappellant was incorrigible, despite his young age at the time of the offense. Based on all\n\nof the evidence presented at the guilt and punishment phases, a rational trier of fact could\n\nhave found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society. Point of error\n\nthree is overruled.\n\n       In his fourth point of error, appellant claims that the evidence is factually\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s affirmative finding of future dangerousness. We have\n\nrepeatedly held that we will not conduct a factual sufficiency review of the jury’s\n\nfuture-dangerousness determination. See McGinn v.

More importantly, we have overruled the decision\n\nupon which appellant’s claim relies. See Martinez, 327 S.W.3d at 736. Point of error\n\nfour is overruled.\n\n                            EXTRANEOUS OFFENSE EVIDENCE\n\n       In his fifth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nevidence of the subsequent aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated robbery at the\n\nguilt phase. He appears to assert that the parties and the court understood before trial that\n\nthis evidence would be admitted at the punishment phase only, and so introducing and\n\nadmitting this evidence at the guilt phase constituted a Rule 404(b) notice violation. See\n\nT EX. R. E VID. 404(b).8 He also argues that this evidence was inadmissible character\n\nevidence under Rule 404(b) because the State did not need it in order to prove a common\n\nscheme or plan to rob Castro. He argues further that this evidence was inadmissible\n\nunder Rule 403 because it was more prejudicial than probative.\n\n                                      A. Rule 404(b) Notice\n\n       The record shows that appellant filed a general discovery motion that included a\n\nrequest under Rule 404(b) for notice of the State’s intent to introduce, in its case-in-chief,\n\nevidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts not arising in the same transaction as the\n\n\n\n       8\n           Unless otherwise indicated all references to Rules refer to the Rules of Evidence.\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 27\n\noffense charged.” This request was granted during a hearing on October 3, 2008. At that\n\ntime, the indictment in four counts charged appellant with four offenses: the instant\n\ncapital-murder offense, the subsequent aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated\n\nrobbery, and evading arrest with a vehicle. The prosecutor presented the testimony of the\n\nvictims of the subsequent robberies at this hearing. He also explained that he did not\n\nexpect to have any evidence requiring Rule 404(b) notice because the offenses he wanted\n\nto introduce were already alleged in the indictment.\n\n       Defense counsel later filed a motion to sever the capital-murder charge from the\n\nother counts of the indictment. That motion was granted during a hearing on October 21,\n\n2008. At the hearing, defense counsel explained that he was requesting the severance\n\nbecause he had become concerned about the potential adverse effects of exposing\n\nveniremembers to allegations of multiple offenses during jury selection. The prosecutor\n\nthen explained that he still intended to introduce evidence of the subsequent offenses at\n\nthe guilt phase, and that he did not believe that the severance would keep out such\n\nevidence:\n\n       [STATE]:           [P]reviously we had a . . . discovery motion, it’s a 404(b)\n                          motion, and I want to make sure and I think Defense Counsel\n                          has already reiterated that, that I – even though the counts are\n                          severed, the State still intends to bring the evidence from\n                          Count[s] 2, 3 and 4 into the case in chief as – as the same\n                          transactional context or res gestae of the offense, and I believe\n                          [defense counsel] has already told us at a previous hearing that\n                          he had no objection to that, . . . and he is not going to object to\n                          the introduction of that even though the jury will not be charged\n                          on that; is that correct?\n\f                                                                     Ramirez - 28\n\n[DEFENSE]:   At punishment, you mean.\n\n[STATE]:     No, sir, I’m talking about in [the] case in chief we have –\n             they’re charged with one crime of . . . capital murder. The State\n             is intending since these incidents all happened right at the same\n             time that we do intend to introduce that evidence into the case\n             in chief.\n\nTHE COURT:   As a 404(b).\n\n[DEFENSE]:   As an extraneous offense and I don’t really think I need to\n             argue that. That’s clearly going to be admissible in that regard.\n\nTHE COURT:   Well, at least you’ve given him notice and he can fight about it.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   We have notice, Judge, and then we can still – we can still\n             lodge whatever objections we feel are necessary to protect the\n             record –\n\nTHE COURT:   Sure.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   – and our client’s best interest in the matter but . . . I think what\n             [the prosecutor] is trying to say or establish is that I have\n             already waived some sort of objection to that?\n\n[STATE]:     No, what I meant was it was understood since all the cases were\n             going to be tried together all that evidence was going to come\n             [in] together.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   Oh, I understand.\n\n[STATE]:     I want the Defense Counsel to know that – and the Defendant to\n             know that just because he’s going to have a Jury Charge on\n             capital murder, that’s not to say that other evidence is still going\n             to come in [sic]. He’s not going to be able to limit just to the\n             killing of Pablo Castro. The State . . . intends to introduce that\n             evidence of Count 2, Count 3 and Count 4 in the case in chief.\n\f                                                                    Ramirez - 29\n\nTHE COURT:   And so basically what he’s saying is he’s going to try to move\n             this in 404(b) and you just need to know that because you’ve\n             asked for notice –\n\n[DEFENSE]:   That’s correct.\n\nTHE COURT:   – and I think the other point is that even if the Court doesn’t\n             allow it in on 404(b) I – if he gets convicted of capital murder –\n\n[STATE]:     It would come in.\n\nTHE COURT:   – he certainly gets to prove it up.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   I understand.\n\nTHE COURT:   Okay.\n\n[DEFENSE]:   And, of course, if he doesn’t get it in under 404(b) he’ll get it in\n             under 37.07.\n\nTHE COURT:   Yeah.\n\n[STATE]:     I just want to make sure, . . . Counsel and the client have\n             discussed the fact that just because he’s limi[t]ing what he’s\n             going to be charged with that may not limit the evidence that’s\n             going to be presented.\n\n             In other words, I don’t intend to introduce evidence of just the\n             capital murder case, I intend to introduce all that evidence in\n             the case in chief so I believe it would be coming in anyway,\n             whether he severs it or not.\n\nTHE COURT:   Okay.\n\n[STATE]:     Has [defense counsel] conveyed that to his client and his client\n             fully understands that?\n\n[DEFENSE]:   I have, Your Honor.\n\n                               ***\n\f                                                                                       Ramirez - 30\n\n       THE COURT:            And you are aware that . . . I don’t know what this Court is\n                             going to do at this point, I’ll have to wait and have a hearing on\n                             the issue but it may very well be that . . . the evidence may\n                             come before the jury in the case in chief, and if not then,\n                             certainly at punishment.\n\n                             You understand that?\n\n       [DEFENDANT]: Yes, I understand that, Your Honor.\n\n       In this colloquy, defense counsel plainly stated that he understood that the State\n\nstill intended to introduce evidence of the subsequent offenses during the presentation of\n\nits case in chief at the guilt phase. Appellant failed to preserve this matter for appellate\n\nreview because he did not challenge the prosecutor’s representations at the admissibility\n\nhearing that the State’s notice to the defense was adequate, and he did not object at trial\n\nthat the defense did not have adequate notice of the State’s intent to introduce evidence of\n\nextraneous offenses.\n\n                              B. Rule 404(b) Character Evidence\n\n       The hearing on the admissibility of this evidence was held on October 29, 2008.9\n\nIn the first part of that hearing, the State presented evidence of the offense of evading\n\narrest with a vehicle. Next, the prosecutor argued that the evidence of the aggravated\n\nrobbery, attempted aggravated robbery, and evading arrest should come in as same-\n\ntransaction contextual evidence or as extraneous-offense evidence tending to show\n\n\n       9\n          At the beginning of the hearing, the trial court announced, “We are here for two\nreasons. One, we were going to talk about the [jury] list, . . . we’ll do that in a little bit. . . .\nWe’re also here because [the prosecutor] intended to introduce extraneous offenses, 404(b) at the\ntime of trial, as I understand it.”\n\f                                                                                Ramirez - 31\n\nmotive, intent, plan, preparation, identity, “and such.” He asserted that the aggravated\n\nrobbery and attempted aggravated robbery offenses showed appellant’s intent to rob\n\nCastro, and that the evading arrest offense was evidence of flight that demonstrated a\n\nconsciousness of guilt.\n\n       At this hearing, defense counsel did not challenge the admissibility of the\n\nextraneous-offense evidence under Rule 404(b), but instead argued that evidence of the\n\nrobbery and attempted robbery offenses should not be admitted because such evidence\n\nwould be more prejudicial than probative under Rule 403. Counsel acknowledged that\n\nthe State sought to introduce evidence of these offenses to show appellant’s intent to rob\n\nCastro in the instant case, but he argued that allowing the State to introduce this evidence\n\nwould provide a “back door” means of prejudicing the defense. The prosecutor\n\nresponded that appellant’s intent to commit robbery was an element of the charged\n\noffense that the State had to prove, and so the evidence was admissible on that basis.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2336338\"><a href=\"/opinion/2336338/johnson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 650 (Tex.

However, we have not found any motions\n\nchallenging the admissibility of this evidence. Nor have we found any reference during\n\f                                                                                 Ramirez - 32\n\nthe trial to such a motion, or any objection referring to the admissibility of extraneous\n\noffenses or unduly prejudicial evidence, and appellant does not direct us to any.

Crim. App.\n\n1982).\n\n         In this case, the extraneous-offense evidence was highly probative because it made\n\nfacts of consequence more likely. See Johnson, 68 S.W.3d at 650-52. First, it made the\n\nfact of appellant’s identity as the murderer more likely. See id. at 651. At trial, appellant\n\nplaced his identity in issue when he cross-examined Cervantes, pointing out that the\n\npolice report of Cervantes’s statement did not mention that Cervantes recognized Castro’s\n\nassailant, and questioning Cervantes about his nearsightedness, the distance from the car\n\nwash to the Times Market parking lot, and the brief opportunity he had to observe the\n\nsuspects. Appellant also cross-examined Butt about whether he had seen appellant\n\nmoving his arm in a stabbing motion, emphasizing that Butt recalled “a punching motion”\n\nbut not “any stabbing movements.” He raised the possibility that Rodriguez was the\n\nmurderer when he cross-examined Chavez about whether she saw Rodriguez stabbing\n\nCastro, and he questioned the medical examiner about whether more than one knife might\n\nhave been used.\n\n         Additionally, the subsequent offenses were similar to the charged offense. See\n\nJohnson, 68 S.W.3d at 650-51. In the subsequent offenses, a female accomplice\n\ndistracted the victim so that appellant could approach from behind with a knife that he\n\f                                                                                          Ramirez - 35\n\nheld to the victim’s throat while demanding money. In the charged offense, a female\n\naccomplice approached Castro and spoke with him before appellant attacked him.\n\nCastro’s throat was slashed and cut multiple times, and his money was taken. The victims\n\nof the subsequent offenses gave descriptions of the suspects, knife, and vehicle that were\n\nsimilar to those given by witnesses to the charged offense.11 Particularly in view of their\n\nclose timing and proximity to the charged offense, these offenses were relevant to show\n\nappellant’s identity as the murderer.\n\n        Second, this evidence made the fact of appellant’s intent to rob Castro more likely.\n\nSee De La Paz, 279 S.W.3d at 349. To establish the “murder in the course of robbery”\n\ntheory of capital murder, the State was required to show that the murder was committed\n\nduring the course of the theft rather than the theft being an afterthought. See Johnson, 68\n\nS.W.3d at 650. This evidence placed the charged offense in the context of the scheme\n\ncarried out that night and tended to establish a conspiracy between appellant and his\n\n\n\n\n        11\n            Appellant now asserts that the testimony of the victims of the subsequent offenses\n“raised the emotional level of the trial” and therefore suggested a decision on an improper basis.\nHowever, he did not object to this specific testimony before or during trial. Although the victims\ntestified at a pretrial hearing and appellant had notice that they would testify at trial, appellant did\nnot single out their testimony as being unduly prejudicial at any time before or during trial, and\nthe trial court was not required to sua sponte sift through the evidence. See, e.g., Roberts, 220\nS.W.3d at 532 (attack on victim-impact testimony in general, advanced before any testimony was\nheard, did not place the trial court on notice that appellant would find particular testimony\nobjectionable); Ladd v.

See, e.g., id. at 651.12 Appellant challenged his involvement in the\n\nunderlying robbery offense by cross-examining Cervantes about whether he recalled\n\nseeing anyone going through Castro’s pockets and raising the possibility that the police\n\nhad suggested this detail to Cervantes while they were taking his statement. In closing\n\nargument, appellant did not deny that he murdered Castro, but he argued that he did not\n\nplan or intend to rob Castro and that he murdered Castro because of something else that\n\ntranspired in the parking lot. At the charge conference, appellant requested and received\n\na jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of murder. In light of the State’s burden\n\nof proof and the matters placed in issue by the defense, the probative value of this\n\nevidence was not substantially outweighed by any prejudice it may have caused.\n\n       We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this\n\nevidence was admissible under Rule 403. Point of error five is overruled.\n\n                        JURY INSTRUCTIONS AT PUNISHMENT\n\n       In his sixth point of error, appellant complains of “egregious error in the\n\ninstructions to the jury at punishment,” in that the jurors were not told what to do if they\n\ncould not agree on the answer to the first special issue. Appellant does not complain\n\n\n       12\n           Appellant now argues that the State did not need this evidence to show that he and his\naccomplices had a common scheme or plan because the State had Chavez’s “unassailed”\ntestimony to that effect. However, Chavez’s testimony could not sustain a conviction unless it\nwas corroborated by other evidence tending to connect appellant with the offense. Art. 38.14;\nSolomon, 49 S.W.3d at 361. Further, Chavez acknowledged at trial that the terms of her plea\nagreement with the State required her to testify against appellant. During cross-examination,\ndefense counsel challenged her credibility by implying that if her testimony minimizing her role\nin the offenses was true, then her sentences of twenty-five years were excessive.\n\f                                                                                      Ramirez - 37\n\nabout the written jury instructions, which were correct. Rather, appellant’s specific\n\ncomplaint is that the trial judge misread the written jury instructions pertaining to the first\n\nspecial issue.\n\n       The record shows that the trial court prefaced the reading of the jury instructions as\n\nfollows:\n\n       All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are at the point where once again I read\n       you the Charge and the lawyers will argue the case to you.[13]\n\nImmediately before the challenged misreading, the court read:\n\n       “The burden of proof in Special Issue No. 1 rests upon the State, and it must\n       prove the affirmative of such issue beyond a reasonable doubt.[14]\n\n       “You are instructed that you may not answer Special Issue No. 1 ‘Yes’\n       unless all of the jurors agree to such answer. Further, you may not answer\n\n\n       13\n          Before reading the instructions at the guilt phase, the trial court gave a more extensive\nexplanation of this process as follows:\n\n       All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we are at the point at the trial where\n       I’m going to read the Charge to you, that is, for those of you that have been on the\n       jury before you know what this is. This is basically like your instruction booklet.\n       I’m going to read the Charge to you. You do not have to memorize what I’m\n       saying because you’re going to get to take this back with you. This is all the\n       instructions you’re going to get, and then after I read the Charge to you, then the\n       lawyers will argue the case to you.\n\nThis explanation made it clear that the written instructions were the jury instructions to be relied\nupon during deliberations. Nothing in the record suggests that the jurors attached more\nsignificance to the reading of the instructions at the punishment phase than they had at the guilt\nphase. Indeed, the court’s explanation at the punishment phase – “we are at the point where once\nagain I read you the Charge” – was a reference back to the process the court followed at the guilt\nphase.\n       14\n          The transcript includes quotation marks to indicate that the court was reading directly\nfrom a written source.\n\f                                                                                        Ramirez - 38\n\n       this Special Issue No. – Special Issue ‘No’ unless ten (10) or more jurors\n       agree. It is not necessary that members of the jury agree on what particular\n       evidence supports a negative answer, that is, an answer of ‘No’ to Special\n       Issue No. 1.”\n\n       Special Issue No. 1, with forms for answers, is as follows:\n\n       “Special Issue No. 1. Is there a probability that the Defendant, John Henry\n       Ramirez, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute\n       a contributory [sic] threat to society?”[15] And there’s a place for answers,\n       and I’ll read them to you.\n\n       “Answer: We, the jury, unanimously find and determine beyond a\n       reasonable doubt that the answer to Special Issue is – to this Special Issue is\n       ‘Yes,’” and there’s a place for the presiding juror to sign, or, “We the jury,\n       because of – because at least ten (10) jurors have a reasonable doubt as to\n       the probability that Defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that\n       would constitute a continuing threat to society, determine that the answer to\n       this Special Issue No. 1 is ‘No,’” and there’s a place for the presiding juror\n       to sign.\n\nThen, as appellant points out, the court misread the following instruction:\n\n       “In the event that the jury is unable to agree upon Special Issue No. 2\n       (sic)[16] under the conditions and instructions outlined above, the Presiding\n       Juror will not sign either form of answer to Special – of this Special Issue.”\n\nThe court then continued reading:\n\n       “You are further instructed that if the jury makes an affirmative finding to\n       Special Issue No. 1, that is, an answer of ‘Yes,’ then the jury shall answer\n       Special Issue No. 2 below.”\n\n\n\n\n       15\n           Appellant does not challenge this particular misreading. The written jury instruction\ncorrectly contained the phrase “continuing threat” rather than “contributory threat.”\n       16\n          The “(sic)” at this point is part of the transcript. It constitutes some evidence that the\ncourt reporter understood that the trial court made a mistake by saying, “Special Issue No. 2.”\n\f                                                                                   Ramirez - 39\n\n       Appellant argues that this misreading of the instructions, in which the trial court\n\nsaid, “Special Issue No. 2,” instead of, “Special Issue No. 1,” effectively failed to tell the\n\njurors what to do if they could not agree on the first special issue. He asserts that this\n\nerror violated the federal constitution’s due process guarantee and the state constitution’s\n\ndue course of law provisions.17 He acknowledges that there was no objection, but he\n\nclaims that the harm is egregious because, if the jury had not been able to agree, the court\n\nwould have imposed a life sentence. “Without direction, they agreed upon an answer that\n\nprompted a death sentence. The error was, consequently, not harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.”\n\n       We question appellant’s characterization of the misreading as jury-charge error\n\nbecause the written jury instruction was correct. At worst, any uncertainty over whether\n\nthe verbal misreading or the correct written instruction was authoritative might have\n\ncreated an ambiguity. However, it is not necessary to resolve this matter because even if\n\nwe assume arguendo that the misreading constituted jury charge error or created an\n\nambiguity, appellant cannot show that he was harmed.\n\n       If no objection to an alleged jury charge error was made at trial, the appellant must\n\nshow that the error created such harm that he did not have a fair and impartial trial.\n\nAlmanza v.

The presiding juror signed the\n\nform indicating that the jury unanimously found that the answer to Special Issue No. 1\n\nwas “Yes.”\n\n       On these facts, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was confused or\n\nmisled by any alleged error or ambiguity. The context makes clear that the trial court\n\nsimply misread one word of the written jury instruction. The court referred to “Special\n\nIssue No. 1” six times before incorrectly referring to “Special Issue No. 2,” and then the\n\ncourt referred again to “Special Issue No. 1” while reading the language that instructed\n\nthe jury on what to do in the event of an affirmative finding.\n\n       Finally, the misread instruction did not concern the jury’s ability to agree or\n\ndisagree on any special issue. The plain language of this instruction concerned only the\n\npresiding juror’s conduct, directing him not to sign the forms in the event that the jury\n\ncould not agree under the outlined conditions. Appellant does not argue, and there is no\n\nevidence, that the court’s misreading so confused the presiding juror, who had the\n\ncorrectly worded written jury instruction before him during deliberations, that he felt\n\ncompelled to sign the forms even if the jurors did not agree.\n\f                                                                             Ramirez - 42\n\n      The record does not reveal any reasonable likelihood that the jurors were misled or\n\nconfused by the challenged misreading.
