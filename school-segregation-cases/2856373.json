Plaintiff-Appellee Ronald Borello\n(“Plaintiff”) was an inmate in Illinois state prison. He\nbrought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against prison employ-\nees Richard Allison, Lisa Gales, John Liefer, and John\nInman (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging that\nthey violated his Eight Amendment rights by failing to\nprotect him from his cellmate, Roberto Abadia (“Abadia”).\nDefendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that\nthey were entitled to qualified immunity. The magistrate\njudge recommended that summary judgment be granted in\nfavor of Defendants. The district court rejected the magis-\n\f2                                                 No. 05-3515\n\ntrate judge’s report and recommendation and denied\nsummary judgment to Defendants. Defendants appeal. For\nthe following reasons, we reverse the district court’s\njudgment, and remand the case for entry of summary\njudgment in favor of Defendants on qualified immunity\ngrounds.\n\n\n                      I. Background1\n  Plaintiff was an inmate at Menard Correctional Center,\nhoused in the One North Cellhouse. His cellmate at the\ntime relevant to this appeal was Roberto Abadia. Defen-\ndants were assigned to work in Plaintiff’s cellhouse, Allison\nas a casework supervisor, Liefer as a corrections officer,\nInman as a department captain, and Gales as a nurse.\n  On several occasions in early January 2001, another\ninmate, Michael Woodrome, talked to Inman, Allison, and\nGales and expressed concern that Abadia and Plaintiff were\nassigned as cellmates. Around the same time, Plaintiff told\nGales that he wanted to be assigned to a different cell,\nbecause Abadia was “nuts.” Gales reported Plaintiff’s\ncomments to Allison and Inman, who told Gales that they\nwere already aware of the situation. Allison and Inman\nmade statements to Gales that led her to believe that\nPlaintiff had already declined an offer to be transferred to\na different cell.\n  On January 11, 2001, Abadia starting behaving in a\n“particularly strange manner.” He acted confused and paced\nin the cell. Also, for long stretches of time, he would place\nhis arms against the cell wall and repeatedly strike his\nhead against his arms. This behavior continued until at\nleast January 15, 2001.\n\n\n1\n  The following facts are presented in the light most favorable\nto Plaintiff, the party resisting summary judgment.\n\fNo. 05-3515                                               3\n\n  On January 12, 2001, Abadia attempted to strike Plaintiff\nwith his fist. Plaintiff stopped the blow before it landed.\nAbadia settled down and Plaintiff did not report the\nincident, feeling that the conflict had been adequately\ndefused.\n  At approximately 9:30 a.m. on January 16, 2001, Abadia\nwoke up Plaintiff and said he was “going home.” Abadia\nbegan packing. Corrections officer Liefer observed Abadia’s\nbehavior and asked Abadia to explain himself. Abadia\nsaid he was packing to go home. Plaintiff asked Liefer to\ncall someone to the cell to help Abadia. Liefer called nurse\nGales and asked her to take Abadia to see a psychiatrist.\nGales came to the cell and asked Abadia what he was doing.\nAbadia said he was leaving and his family was waiting for\nhim in the parking lot. Gales realized that Abadia had a\nconsiderable amount of time left on his sentence. Plaintiff\ntold Gales that Abadia had recently tried to strike him.\nGales called Dr. Vallabhaneni, a psychiatrist, described\nAbadia’s behavior, and arranged for Abadia to visit the\ndoctor. Liefer removed Abadia from the cell and took him\nfor an examination.\n  About fifteen minutes after being taken to the psychia-\ntrist, Abadia was returned to the cell and then taken to the\nexercise yard for approximately one hour. While Abadia was\nin the exercise yard, Plaintiff asked to see department\ncaptain Inman. Plaintiff was taken to Inman’s office around\n10:30 a.m. Casework supervisor Allison was in Inman’s\noffice when Plaintiff arrived. Allison had told Inman about\nthe situation between Plaintiff and Abadia. Plaintiff\nexplained to Allison and Inman that Abadia had packed his\nbelongings and said he was going home, and that Abadia\nhad been banging his head against his arms on the cell\nwall. Plaintiff asked Inman if he could be moved to a\ndifferent cell, and Inman responded “no.” Plaintiff asserts\nthat Inman also called him a “bug,” laughed at him, and\ntold him to go back to his cell. Plaintiff acknowledges,\n\f4                                               No. 05-3515\n\nhowever, that Inman told him that he could choose either to\ngo back to the cell he shared with Abadia or be placed in\nsegregation. Plaintiff chose to return to his cell.\n  Plaintiff was taken back to his cell and Abadia returned\nfrom the exercise yard. Inman and Allison questioned\nAbadia for approximately five minutes, and then left the\ncell. Plaintiff and Abadia both immediately went to sleep.\n  Approximately one week later, on January 23, 2001,\nAbadia hit Plaintiff on the side of the face with a radio,\ncausing serious injury to his left eye.\n  Plaintiff brought a § 1983 suit against Allison, Gales,\nLiefer, and Inman, alleging violations of his Eighth Amend-\nment rights. Plaintiff alleged that Defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to the danger posed to him\nbecause they left him in a cell with Abadia. Defendants\nmoved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified\nimmunity. Defendants argued that they did not ignore a\nrisk of harm to Plaintiff, but responded reasonably to his\nneeds by having Abadia examined by a psychiatrist and\ninterviewing the two inmates. Alternatively, Defendants\nargued, it was not clearly established at the time of the\nincident that their actions constituted an Eighth Amend-\nment violation.\n  The magistrate judge recommended that the district court\ngrant summary judgment for Defendants. The magistrate\njudge found that even if Defendants were aware of the risk\nof harm to Plaintiff, they took reasonable steps in response\nto the risk.\n  The district court rejected the magistrate judge’s report\nand recommendations. The district court found that there\nwas sufficient evidence that Abadia presented a serious risk\nof harm to Plaintiff. The district court also determined that\nthere was sufficient evidence that Defendants knew of the\nrisk Abadia posed to Plaintiff, but did nothing in response.\nThe district court found relevant that one week before\n\fNo. 05-3515                                                   5\n\nAbadia hit Plaintiff with the radio, Plaintiff asked prison\nofficials to move him out of the shared cell. The district\ncourt also emphasized that Plaintiff told Defendants how\nstrangely Abadia had been acting in the previous weeks.\nBased on this evidence, the district court denied Defen-\ndants’ qualified immunity defense, finding that there was\na material question of fact as to whether Defendants’\nresponse was reasonable.\n\n\n                       II. Discussion\n   We review de novo the district court’s determination of\nqualified immunity. See McGrath v. Gillis, 44 F.3d 567, 569\n(7th Cir. 1995). We will affirm the district court’s judgment\nif we find that Plaintiff is “present[ed] a version of the facts\nthat is supported by the evidence and under which defen-\ndants would not be entitled to qualified immunity.” Mar-\nshall v. Allen, 984 F.2d 787, 793 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting\nHall v. Ryan, 957 F.2d 402, 404 (7th Cir. 1992)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Under the qualified immunity analysis, government\nofficials performing discretionary functions are immune\nfrom suit if “their conduct ‘could reasonably have been\nthought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have\nviolated.’ ” Sornberger v. City of Knoxville, 434 F.3d 1006,\n1013 (7th Cir. 2006) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. 635, 638-39 (1987)). Qualified immunity protects a\ndefendant from liability as well as from the burden of\nstanding trial. For that reason, courts should determine\nas early on in the proceedings as possible whether a\ndefendant is entitled to qualified immunity. See id.; see also\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).\n  In evaluating a claim of qualified immunity, a court\nconducts a two-step inquiry: “First the court must deter-\nmine whether the disputed conduct, as alleged, violates a\nconstitutional right; second, the court must determine\n\f6                                                No. 05-3515\n\nwhether that right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of\nthe alleged conduct.” Wernsing v. Thompson, 423 F.3d 732,\n742 (7th Cir. 2005) (citing Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201). The\nCourt is required to consider the two steps in the proper\norder. See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (“If no constitutional\nright would have been violated were the allegations estab-\nlished, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning\nqualified immunity. On the other hand, if a violation could\nbe made out on a favorable view of the parties’ submissions,\nthe next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was\nclearly established.”).\n  Before we reach the merits of the appeal, however, we\nmust consider whether we have jurisdiction to consider\nDefendants’ arguments. The Court’s jurisdiction over an\nappeal from a denial of a qualified immunity defense is\nlimited: the defendant “may not appeal a district court’s\nsummary judgment order insofar as that order determines\nwhether or not the pretrial record sets forth a ‘genuine’\nissue of material fact.” Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d 469,\n476 (7th Cir. 2005) (internal citation and quotation marks\nomitted). Put another way, “it is inappropriate for us to\nreview a district court’s determination about the sufficiency\nof the evidence.” Id.\n   However, the Court may “review ‘abstract issues of law.’ ”\nId. (quoting Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319-20 (1995)).\nThe Court’s “jurisdiction extends to interlocutory appeals\nsuch as this one challenging a district court’s determination\nthat a set of facts demonstrate a violation of ‘clearly estab-\nlished’ constitutional law and preclude the defendants from\nproffering a qualified immunity defense.” Id. “When\ndeciding whether a public official is entitled to qualified\nimmunity, ‘we simply assume the disputed facts in the light\nmost favorable [to the plaintiff], and then decide, under\nthose facts, whether the [defendants] violated any of [the\nplaintiff’s] clearly established constitutional rights.’ ” Id.\n(quoting Coady v. Steil, 197 F.3d 727, 731 (7th Cir. 1999));\n\fNo. 05-3515                                                7\n\nsee also Nanda v. Moss, 412 F.3d 836, 838 n.1 (7th Cir.\n2005); Johnson, 515 U.S. at 311.\n   Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff,\nwe now consider whether Defendants violated Plain-\ntiff’s clearly established Eighth Amendment rights. De-\nfendants had a duty as prison officials to protect Plaintiff\n“from violence at the hands of other inmates.” Washington\nv. LaPorte County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 306 F.3d 515, 517 (7th\nCir. 2002). However, “not every injury within a prison is an\nEighth Amendment violation.” Id.; see also Haley v. Gross,\n86 F.3d 630, 640 (7th Cir. 1996).\n  To establish an Eight Amendment failure to protect claim,\na plaintiff must show 1) that he suffered an objectively\n“sufficiently serious” injury; and 2) that he was “incarcer-\nated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious\nharm.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).\nAdditionally,\n    a prison official may be liable “only if he knows that\n    inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and\n    disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable\n    measures to abate it.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847. That\n    the officer had actual knowledge of impending harm can\n    be inferred from circumstantial evidence. Id. at 842;\n    James v. Milwaukee County, 956 F.2d 696, 700 (7th Cir.\n    1992); Peate v. McCann, 294 F.3d 879, 882 (7th Cir.\n    2002). Proving deliberate indifference, however, re-\n    quires more than a showing of negligent or even grossly\n    negligent behavior. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835; James,\n    956 F.2d at 699. Rather, the corrections officer must\n    have acted with the equivalent of criminal recklessness.\n    Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836-37; James, 956 F.2d at 700;\n    Jackson [v. Ill. Medi-Car, Inc., 300 F.3d 760, 765 (7th\n    Cir. 2002)]. Indeed, an officer who actually knew of a\n    substantial risk to a detainee’s safety is free from\n    liability “if [he] responded reasonably to the risk, even\n\f8                                                No. 05-3515\n\n    if the harm ultimately was not averted, because in that\n    case it cannot be said that [he was] deliberately indiffer-\n    ent.” Peate, 294 F.3d at 882 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n    847, 114 S.Ct. 1970). “The test of deliberate indifference\n    ensures that the mere failure of the prison official to\n    choose the best course of action does not amount to a\n    constitutional violation.” Id. (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n    844).\nFisher v. Lovejoy, 414 F.3d 659, 662 (7th Cir. 2005).\n  In this case, Defendants admit that there are facts\nindicating they had knowledge Plaintiff faced a risk of\nserious harm. They argue, however, that they responded\nreasonably to the risk. Defendants emphasize that they took\nAbadia to see the psychiatrist, Dr. Vallabhaneni, as soon as\nPlaintiff complained about Abadia’s behavior on January\n16, 2001. Dr. Vallabhaneni examined Abadia and deter-\nmined that he was fit to return to his cell. Defendants\nmaintain that they were justified in relying on Dr.\nVallabhaneni’s medical opinion. Defendants also point out\nthat they interviewed Plaintiff and Abadia on January 16\nand determined that the situation was under control.\n  The district court found there was genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether Defendants were justified in\nrelying on Dr. Vallabhaneni’s decision to send Abadia back\nto his cell. The district court found relevant that there\nwas no evidence regarding 1) what the doctor told Defen-\ndants; 2) whether the doctor’s opinion was reasonable; or 3)\nwhat the defendants told the doctor before he examined\nAbadia. The district court determined that without this\nevidence, there was no way to determine whether Defen-\ndants’ reliance on the doctor’s orders was reasonable.\n  We do not question the district court’s reading of the\nrecord. However, we conclude as a matter of law that the\nevidence is insufficient to find that Defendants responded\nunreasonably to the risk of harm posed to Plaintiff. As the\nparty resisting summary judgment, Plaintiff had the burden\n\fNo. 05-3515                                                 9\n\nto go beyond the pleadings and “affirmatively demonstrate,\nby specific factual allegations, that there is a genuine issue\nof material fact which requires trial.” East-Miller v. Lake\nCounty Highway Dep’t, 421 F.3d 558, 561 (7th Cir. 2005)\n(quoting Beard v. Whitley County REMC, 840 F.2d 405, 410\n(7th Cir. 1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plain-\ntiff has not explained why it was unreasonable for Defen-\ndants to rely on Dr. Vallabhaneni’s medical opinion that it\nwas safe to return Abadia to the cell he shared with Plain-\ntiff. For instance, Plaintiff has not alleged that Dr.\nVallabhaneni had insufficient information to decide that it\nwas safe for Abadia to return to his cell, that Dr.\nVallabhaneni’s medical opinion was unreasonable, or that\nDr. Vallabhaneni told Defendants anything that would\nindicate that it was unsafe for Abadia and Plaintiff to\ncontinue sharing a cell. Plaintiff had an opportunity to\ndepose Defendants, but is unable to point to any testimony\nsupporting his position that Defendants should have\ndisregarded Dr. Vallabhaneni’s medical opinion.\n  Additionally, the undisputed evidence shows that Defen-\ndants did not rely solely on Dr. Vallabhaneni’s opinion in\ndeciding that Plaintiff could remain in the cell with Abadia.\nIn addition to taking Abadia to see a psychiatrist, they\ninterviewed the two inmates to assess the situation.\nDefendants determined that the tension between the\ninmates had been diffused. After Defendants took these\nactions, both men immediately went to sleep in the cell. The\nattack on Plaintiff did not occur until a week later, and\nthere was no evidence that Plaintiff complained about\nAbadia between January 16 and the time of the attack.\n  The evidence shows that Defendants responded immedi-\nately to Plaintiff’s complaints about Abadia, even if their\nresponse turned out to be inadequate. This is in contrast to\nother cases in which we have found Eighth Amendment\nviolations based on failure to protect, in which a prison\nofficial ignored an inmate’s complaint that he feared\n\f10                                               No. 05-3515\n\nviolence from his cellmate or did not respond to actual\nviolence between inmates. See, e.g., Velez v. Johnson, 395\nF.3d 732, 736-37 (7th Cir. 2005) (deliberate indifference\nfound when prison guard failed to respond to an emergency\ncall made by an inmate who was being attacked by his\ncellmate); Haley, 86 F.3d at 642 (deliberate indifference\nfound where prison officer ignored as many as seven\ncomplaints by an inmate about his ongoing feud with his\ncellmate and his cellmate’s “crazy” and “intimidating”\nbehavior and never checked in on the cellmates).\n   We emphasize that a prison official is not entitled to\nqualified immunity simply because he or she takes any\naction in response to a risk of harm to an inmate—that\nresponse must be reasonable. In this case, we find that\nDefendants’ response was “reasonably calculated to\nquickly restore order to a chaotic situation.” Fisher, 414\nF.3d at 664 (prison official was not deliberately indiffer-\nent when he responded to inmates’ attack on the plaintiff\ninmate by placing all the inmates against a wall, even\nthough the plaintiff was then stabbed by another inmate,\nbecause his response was reasonable under the circum-\nstances). After Abadia returned from seeing Dr.\nVallabhaneni, both Abadia and Plaintiff immediately went\nto sleep, leading Defendants to believe that any tension\nbetween the cellmates was diffused. Under these circum-\nstances, Defendants’ decision to leave Abadia and Plain-\ntiff in the same cell “was not ‘so dangerous that the deliber-\nate nature of [Defendants’] actions [could] be inferred.’ ” Id.\n(quoting Jackson v. Ill. Medi-Car, Inc., 300 F.3d 760, 765\n(7th Cir. 2002)); see also Watts v. Laurent, 774 F.2d 168, 172\n(7th Cir. 1985).\n  Defendants may have acted negligently by not moving\nPlaintiff to another cell. But as we have repeatedly stated,\n“[m]ere negligence or even gross negligence does not\nconstitute deliberate indifference.” Snipes v. DeTella, 95\nF.3d 586, 590 (7th Cir. 1996) (citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501\n\fNo. 05-3515                                                    11\n\nU.S. 294, 305 (1991)). Failure to protect an inmate from\nharm “violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel\nand unusual punishment only if ‘deliberate indifference by\nprison officials [to the prisoner’s welfare] effectively con-\ndones the attack by allowing it to happen [.]’ ” Lewis v.\nRichards, 107 F.3d 549, 553 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting Haley,\n86 F.3d at 640). Based on the record below, we find that\nPlaintiff has failed to show that Defendants effectively\ncondoned Abadia’s attack on him.2 Defendants therefore are\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n  This should be the end of our inquiry. Because Defendant\nhas not shown that his constitutional rights were violated,\nwe need not move to the second step of the qualified\nimmunity analysis: whether those rights were clearly\nestablished at the time of the attack. We note, however,\nthat the district court improperly simplified this second\nstep, finding that “[i]t is untenable to say that prison\nofficials don’t know what actions in this area are illegal.”\nThis analysis relieved Plaintiff of his burden of proof. See\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201.\n  The inquiry into whether a right is clearly established\n“must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the\ncase, not as a broad general proposition.” Brosseau v.\n\n\n2\n   Plaintiff asserts in his brief that Inman gave him a choice\nbetween going to segregation or staying in his cell with Abadia.\nPlaintiff decided to remain in the cell. Although Plaintiff may\nhave viewed being placed in segregation as an unfair punishment,\n“it is common to place prisoners in segregation for their own\nprotection.” Case v. Ahitow, 301 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2002). We\ncannot consider this issue, however, because neither\nparty discussed it in the proceedings below. In Plaintiff ’s brief,\nhe cites to his own deposition testimony for the fact that he\ncould have moved to segregation. However, only excerpts of the\ndeposition are included, and the page to which he cites is not\npart of the record on appeal.\n\f12                                               No. 05-3515\n\nHaugen, 534 U.S. 194, 198 (2004) (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). It is insufficient for a plaintiff\nsimply to point to a recognized constitutional right and\nclaim that the right has been violated. A plaintiff is re-\nquired to show that a violation of that right has been found\nin factually similar cases, or that the violation was so clear\nthat an official would realize he or she was violating an\ninmate’s constitutional rights even in the absence of an on-\npoint case. See Wernsing, 423 F.3d at 742; see also Ulichny\nv. Merton Comm. Sch. Dist., 249 F.3d 686, 706 (7th Cir.\n2001) (“A right is not clearly established if officers of\nreasonable competence could disagree on the issue.”);\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640 (“The contours of the right must\nbe sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would under-\nstand that what he is doing violates that right.”).\n  Although it is well established that a plaintiff can bring\nan Eighth Amendment claim based on a prison official’s\ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm,\nthere is still a question whether the facts of this case are\nsufficient to establish deliberate indifference. The purpose\nof the second step of the qualified immunity analysis is to\nensure that prison officials will not be held personally liable\nfor their official conduct when they were not aware that\ntheir conduct violated any of an inmate’s constitutional\nrights. Plaintiff has not attempted to compare this case to\nany factually similar ones, or argue that the violation was\nso obvious that Defendants should have been on notice that\ntheir actions constituted deliberate indifference.\n\n\n                      III.

Plaintiff-Appellee Ronald Borello\n(“Plaintiff”) was an inmate in Illinois state prison. He\nbrought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against prison employ-\nees Richard Allison, Lisa Gales, John Liefer, and John\nInman (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging that\nthey violated his Eight Amendment rights by failing to\nprotect him from his cellmate, Roberto Abadia (“Abadia”).\nDefendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that\nthey were entitled to qualified immunity. The magistrate\njudge recommended that summary judgment be granted in\nfavor of Defendants. The district court rejected the magis-\n\f2                                                 No. 05-3515\n\ntrate judge’s report and recommendation and denied\nsummary judgment to Defendants. Defendants appeal. For\nthe following reasons, we reverse the district court’s\njudgment, and remand the case for entry of summary\njudgment in favor of Defendants on qualified immunity\ngrounds.\n\n\n                      I. Background1\n  Plaintiff was an inmate at Menard Correctional Center,\nhoused in the One North Cellhouse. His cellmate at the\ntime relevant to this appeal was Roberto Abadia. Defen-\ndants were assigned to work in Plaintiff’s cellhouse, Allison\nas a casework supervisor, Liefer as a corrections officer,\nInman as a department captain, and Gales as a nurse.\n  On several occasions in early January 2001, another\ninmate, Michael Woodrome, talked to Inman, Allison, and\nGales and expressed concern that Abadia and Plaintiff were\nassigned as cellmates. Around the same time, Plaintiff told\nGales that he wanted to be assigned to a different cell,\nbecause Abadia was “nuts.” Gales reported Plaintiff’s\ncomments to Allison and Inman, who told Gales that they\nwere already aware of the situation. Allison and Inman\nmade statements to Gales that led her to believe that\nPlaintiff had already declined an offer to be transferred to\na different cell.\n  On January 11, 2001, Abadia starting behaving in a\n“particularly strange manner.” He acted confused and paced\nin the cell. Also, for long stretches of time, he would place\nhis arms against the cell wall and repeatedly strike his\nhead against his arms. This behavior continued until at\nleast January 15, 2001.\n\n\n1\n  The following facts are presented in the light most favorable\nto Plaintiff, the party resisting summary judgment.\n\fNo. 05-3515                                               3\n\n  On January 12, 2001, Abadia attempted to strike Plaintiff\nwith his fist. Plaintiff stopped the blow before it landed.\nAbadia settled down and Plaintiff did not report the\nincident, feeling that the conflict had been adequately\ndefused.\n  At approximately 9:30 a.m. on January 16, 2001, Abadia\nwoke up Plaintiff and said he was “going home.” Abadia\nbegan packing. Corrections officer Liefer observed Abadia’s\nbehavior and asked Abadia to explain himself. Abadia\nsaid he was packing to go home. Plaintiff asked Liefer to\ncall someone to the cell to help Abadia. Liefer called nurse\nGales and asked her to take Abadia to see a psychiatrist.\nGales came to the cell and asked Abadia what he was doing.\nAbadia said he was leaving and his family was waiting for\nhim in the parking lot. Gales realized that Abadia had a\nconsiderable amount of time left on his sentence. Plaintiff\ntold Gales that Abadia had recently tried to strike him.\nGales called Dr. Vallabhaneni, a psychiatrist, described\nAbadia’s behavior, and arranged for Abadia to visit the\ndoctor. Liefer removed Abadia from the cell and took him\nfor an examination.\n  About fifteen minutes after being taken to the psychia-\ntrist, Abadia was returned to the cell and then taken to the\nexercise yard for approximately one hour. While Abadia was\nin the exercise yard, Plaintiff asked to see department\ncaptain Inman. Plaintiff was taken to Inman’s office around\n10:30 a.m. Casework supervisor Allison was in Inman’s\noffice when Plaintiff arrived. Allison had told Inman about\nthe situation between Plaintiff and Abadia. Plaintiff\nexplained to Allison and Inman that Abadia had packed his\nbelongings and said he was going home, and that Abadia\nhad been banging his head against his arms on the cell\nwall. Plaintiff asked Inman if he could be moved to a\ndifferent cell, and Inman responded “no.” Plaintiff asserts\nthat Inman also called him a “bug,” laughed at him, and\ntold him to go back to his cell. Plaintiff acknowledges,\n\f4                                               No. 05-3515\n\nhowever, that Inman told him that he could choose either to\ngo back to the cell he shared with Abadia or be placed in\nsegregation. Plaintiff chose to return to his cell.\n  Plaintiff was taken back to his cell and Abadia returned\nfrom the exercise yard. Inman and Allison questioned\nAbadia for approximately five minutes, and then left the\ncell. Plaintiff and Abadia both immediately went to sleep.\n  Approximately one week later, on January 23, 2001,\nAbadia hit Plaintiff on the side of the face with a radio,\ncausing serious injury to his left eye.\n  Plaintiff brought a § 1983 suit against Allison, Gales,\nLiefer, and Inman, alleging violations of his Eighth Amend-\nment rights. Plaintiff alleged that Defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to the danger posed to him\nbecause they left him in a cell with Abadia. Defendants\nmoved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified\nimmunity. Defendants argued that they did not ignore a\nrisk of harm to Plaintiff, but responded reasonably to his\nneeds by having Abadia examined by a psychiatrist and\ninterviewing the two inmates. Alternatively, Defendants\nargued, it was not clearly established at the time of the\nincident that their actions constituted an Eighth Amend-\nment violation.\n  The magistrate judge recommended that the district court\ngrant summary judgment for Defendants. The magistrate\njudge found that even if Defendants were aware of the risk\nof harm to Plaintiff, they took reasonable steps in response\nto the risk.\n  The district court rejected the magistrate judge’s report\nand recommendations. The district court found that there\nwas sufficient evidence that Abadia presented a serious risk\nof harm to Plaintiff. The district court also determined that\nthere was sufficient evidence that Defendants knew of the\nrisk Abadia posed to Plaintiff, but did nothing in response.\nThe district court found relevant that one week before\n\fNo. 05-3515                                                   5\n\nAbadia hit Plaintiff with the radio, Plaintiff asked prison\nofficials to move him out of the shared cell. The district\ncourt also emphasized that Plaintiff told Defendants how\nstrangely Abadia had been acting in the previous weeks.\nBased on this evidence, the district court denied Defen-\ndants’ qualified immunity defense, finding that there was\na material question of fact as to whether Defendants’\nresponse was reasonable.\n\n\n                       II.

Qualified immunity protects a\ndefendant from liability as well as from the burden of\nstanding trial. For that reason, courts should determine\nas early on in the proceedings as possible whether a\ndefendant is entitled to qualified immunity. See id.; see also\nSaucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (2001).\n  In evaluating a claim of qualified immunity, a court\nconducts a two-step inquiry: “First the court must deter-\nmine whether the disputed conduct, as alleged, violates a\nconstitutional right; second, the court must determine\n\f6                                                No. 05-3515\n\nwhether that right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of\nthe alleged conduct.” Wernsing v.

The\nCourt is required to consider the two steps in the proper\norder. See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (“If no constitutional\nright would have been violated were the allegations estab-\nlished, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning\nqualified immunity. On the other hand, if a violation could\nbe made out on a favorable view of the parties’ submissions,\nthe next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was\nclearly established.”).\n  Before we reach the merits of the appeal, however, we\nmust consider whether we have jurisdiction to consider\nDefendants’ arguments. The Court’s jurisdiction over an\nappeal from a denial of a qualified immunity defense is\nlimited: the defendant “may not appeal a district court’s\nsummary judgment order insofar as that order determines\nwhether or not the pretrial record sets forth a ‘genuine’\nissue of material fact.” Board v.

They argue, however, that they responded\nreasonably to the risk. Defendants emphasize that they took\nAbadia to see the psychiatrist, Dr. Vallabhaneni, as soon as\nPlaintiff complained about Abadia’s behavior on January\n16, 2001. Dr. Vallabhaneni examined Abadia and deter-\nmined that he was fit to return to his cell. Defendants\nmaintain that they were justified in relying on Dr.\nVallabhaneni’s medical opinion. Defendants also point out\nthat they interviewed Plaintiff and Abadia on January 16\nand determined that the situation was under control.\n  The district court found there was genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether Defendants were justified in\nrelying on Dr. Vallabhaneni’s decision to send Abadia back\nto his cell. The district court found relevant that there\nwas no evidence regarding 1) what the doctor told Defen-\ndants; 2) whether the doctor’s opinion was reasonable; or 3)\nwhat the defendants told the doctor before he examined\nAbadia. The district court determined that without this\nevidence, there was no way to determine whether Defen-\ndants’ reliance on the doctor’s orders was reasonable.\n  We do not question the district court’s reading of the\nrecord. However, we conclude as a matter of law that the\nevidence is insufficient to find that Defendants responded\nunreasonably to the risk of harm posed to Plaintiff.

Plain-\ntiff has not explained why it was unreasonable for Defen-\ndants to rely on Dr. Vallabhaneni’s medical opinion that it\nwas safe to return Abadia to the cell he shared with Plain-\ntiff. For instance, Plaintiff has not alleged that Dr.\nVallabhaneni had insufficient information to decide that it\nwas safe for Abadia to return to his cell, that Dr.\nVallabhaneni’s medical opinion was unreasonable, or that\nDr. Vallabhaneni told Defendants anything that would\nindicate that it was unsafe for Abadia and Plaintiff to\ncontinue sharing a cell. Plaintiff had an opportunity to\ndepose Defendants, but is unable to point to any testimony\nsupporting his position that Defendants should have\ndisregarded Dr. Vallabhaneni’s medical opinion.\n  Additionally, the undisputed evidence shows that Defen-\ndants did not rely solely on Dr. Vallabhaneni’s opinion in\ndeciding that Plaintiff could remain in the cell with Abadia.\nIn addition to taking Abadia to see a psychiatrist, they\ninterviewed the two inmates to assess the situation.\nDefendants determined that the tension between the\ninmates had been diffused. After Defendants took these\nactions, both men immediately went to sleep in the cell. The\nattack on Plaintiff did not occur until a week later, and\nthere was no evidence that Plaintiff complained about\nAbadia between January 16 and the time of the attack.\n  The evidence shows that Defendants responded immedi-\nately to Plaintiff’s complaints about Abadia, even if their\nresponse turned out to be inadequate. This is in contrast to\nother cases in which we have found Eighth Amendment\nviolations based on failure to protect, in which a prison\nofficial ignored an inmate’s complaint that he feared\n\f10                                               No. 05-3515\n\nviolence from his cellmate or did not respond to actual\nviolence between inmates.

In this case, we find that\nDefendants’ response was “reasonably calculated to\nquickly restore order to a chaotic situation.” Fisher, 414\nF.3d at 664 (prison official was not deliberately indiffer-\nent when he responded to inmates’ attack on the plaintiff\ninmate by placing all the inmates against a wall, even\nthough the plaintiff was then stabbed by another inmate,\nbecause his response was reasonable under the circum-\nstances). After Abadia returned from seeing Dr.\nVallabhaneni, both Abadia and Plaintiff immediately went\nto sleep, leading Defendants to believe that any tension\nbetween the cellmates was diffused. Under these circum-\nstances, Defendants’ decision to leave Abadia and Plain-\ntiff in the same cell “was not ‘so dangerous that the deliber-\nate nature of [Defendants’] actions [could] be inferred.’ ” Id.\n(quoting Jackson v.

Failure to protect an inmate from\nharm “violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel\nand unusual punishment only if ‘deliberate indifference by\nprison officials [to the prisoner’s welfare] effectively con-\ndones the attack by allowing it to happen [.]’ ” Lewis v.\nRichards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736255\"><a href=\"/opinion/736255/tommy-ray-lewis-v-thomas-d-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting Haley,\n86 F.3d at 640). Based on the record below, we find that\nPlaintiff has failed to show that Defendants effectively\ncondoned Abadia’s attack on him.2 Defendants therefore are\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n  This should be the end of our inquiry. Because Defendant\nhas not shown that his constitutional rights were violated,\nwe need not move to the second step of the qualified\nimmunity analysis: whether those rights were clearly\nestablished at the time of the attack. We note, however,\nthat the district court improperly simplified this second\nstep, finding that “[i]t is untenable to say that prison\nofficials don’t know what actions in this area are illegal.”\nThis analysis relieved Plaintiff of his burden of proof. See\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 201.\n  The inquiry into whether a right is clearly established\n“must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the\ncase, not as a broad general proposition.” Brosseau v.\n\n\n2\n   Plaintiff asserts in his brief that Inman gave him a choice\nbetween going to segregation or staying in his cell with Abadia.\nPlaintiff decided to remain in the cell. Although Plaintiff may\nhave viewed being placed in segregation as an unfair punishment,\n“it is common to place prisoners in segregation for their own\nprotection.” Case v. Ahitow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778901\"><a href=\"/opinion/778901/bryan-case-v-rodney-ahitow/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (7th Cir. 2002). We\ncannot consider this issue, however, because neither\nparty discussed it in the proceedings below. In Plaintiff ’s brief,\nhe cites to his own deposition testimony for the fact that he\ncould have moved to segregation. However, only excerpts of the\ndeposition are included, and the page to which he cites is not\npart of the record on appeal.\n\f12                                               No. 05-3515\n\nHaugen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (2004) (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). It is insufficient for a plaintiff\nsimply to point to a recognized constitutional right and\nclaim that the right has been violated. A plaintiff is re-\nquired to show that a violation of that right has been found\nin factually similar cases, or that the violation was so clear\nthat an official would realize he or she was violating an\ninmate’s constitutional rights even in the absence of an on-\npoint case. See Wernsing, 423 F.3d at 742; see also Ulichny\nv. Merton Comm. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773170\"><a href=\"/opinion/773170/susan-ulichny-v-merton-community-school-district-mark-flynn-timothy-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (7th Cir.\n2001) (“A right is not clearly established if officers of\nreasonable competence could disagree on the issue.”);\nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640 (“The contours of the right must\nbe sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would under-\nstand that what he is doing violates that right.”).\n  Although it is well established that a plaintiff can bring\nan Eighth Amendment claim based on a prison official’s\ndeliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm,\nthere is still a question whether the facts of this case are\nsufficient to establish deliberate indifference. The purpose\nof the second step of the qualified immunity analysis is to\nensure that prison officials will not be held personally liable\nfor their official conduct when they were not aware that\ntheir conduct violated any of an inmate’s constitutional\nrights. Plaintiff has not attempted to compare this case to\nany factually similar ones, or argue that the violation was\nso obvious that Defendants should have been on notice that\ntheir actions constituted deliberate indifference.\n\n\n                      III.
