Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 137 F.Supp.2d 1224 (2001)</i> [<i>Parents Involved I</i>], <i>rev'd,</i> 285 F.3d 1236 (9th Cir.2002) <i>[Parents Involved II], withdrawn,</i> 294 F.3d 1084 (9th Cir.2002), <i>certifying questions,</i> 294 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2002) [<i>Parents Involved III</i>]. We draw the following restatement of facts largely from <i>Parents Involved II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Seattle School District Number 1 (the \"School District\") operates ten public high schools: Ballard, Chief Sealth, Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield, Ingraham, Nathan Hale, Rainier Beach, Roosevelt, and West Seattle. Four of these (Ballard, Ingraham, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt) are located north of downtown Seattle; of the remaining six, five (Chief Sealth, Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield, and Rainier Beach) are located south of downtown, and one (West Seattle) is located directly west of downtown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These schools vary widely in quality, as measured by such factors as standardized test scores,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> numbers of college preparatory and Advanced Placement (AP) courses offered and the availability of an Internal Baccalaureate (IB) program, percentages of students taking AP courses and SATs, percentages of graduates who attend college, <i>Seattle Times</i> college-preparedness rankings, University of Washington rankings, and disciplinary statistics. Moreover, some of the schools offer unique educational programs or opportunities not offered in other schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School District has never been segregated by law. However, due to Seattle's racially imbalanced housing patterns,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> if Seattle's children were simply assigned to the high schools nearest their homes, those schools would tend to reflect such imbalance. That is, the demographic profile of the individual high schools would not mirror the demographic makeup of the city's student population as a whole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> As part of its continuing efforts to prevent such imbalance and to promote racial diversity in its high schools, the School District has adopted an open choice plan instead of simply assigning students to the high schools nearest their homes. Pursuant to this system, each student may choose to attend any of the ten high schools in the city, so long as there is room available in that school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District's open choice plan provides for a multi-step application process. Each student is first asked to rank the high schools he or she would like to attend. If a student is not admitted to his or her first-choice school because that school is full, the School District attempts to assign him or her to his or her second-choice school, and so on. If a student is not admitted to any of his or her chosen schools, he or she receives a mandatory assignment to a school with available space.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, a significant problem arises when a school becomes \"oversubscribed\" &#8212; that is, when more students want to attend that school than there are spaces available. For the academic year 2000-01, five of the School District's high schools were oversubscribed and five were undersubscribed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The magnitude of oversubscription during the 2000-01 school year underscores its problematic nature: Approximately 82 percent of students selected one of the oversubscribed high schools as their first choice, while only about 18 percent picked one of the undersubscribed high schools as their first choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve the dilemma of oversubscription, the School District's high school assignment plan uses a series of four \"tiebreakers\" to determine which students will be admitted to each oversubscribed school. The first tiebreaker gives a preference to students with siblings already attending the requested school. This tiebreaker accounts for somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of high school assignments. If a school is still oversubscribed after applying this first tiebreaker, the School District proceeds to a second tiebreaker, which is based entirely on race. For purposes of the racial tiebreaker, students are deemed to be of the race specified in their registration forms, which ask parents to identify their child's race. Because registration must be completed in person by a parent, if a parent declines to specify a racial category, the School District assigns the student a category based on a visual inspection of the parent (and, if present, the student) at the time of registration. It is this second &#8212; racial &#8212; tiebreaker that spawned the present suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Use of the racial tiebreaker is designed to balance the racial makeup of the city's public high schools. Accordingly, if an oversubscribed school's demographic profile deviates from the overall demography of Seattle's student population (approximately 40 percent white and 60 percent non-white) by more than a set number of percentage points, the School District designates that school \"integration positive.\" The racial tiebreaker is then applied in the course of determining admissions to such schools, so that students whose race (coded by the School District simply as white or non-white) will push an integration positive school closer to the desired racial ratio are automatically admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, at Franklin (for instance), whites are admitted preferentially because they <i>are</i> white; and at Ballard, non-whites are admitted preferentially because they <i>are not</i> white.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Ultimately, the School District's use of this racial tiebreaker determines where about 10 percent of applicants will be admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once all students of the preferred racial category are admitted to an oversubscribed high school, any remaining \"ties\" are broken by resort to a third variable: distance. Quite simply, applicants are admitted on the basis of the mileage between their homes and the school to which they seek admission, with those who live closest admitted first. Although a fourth tiebreaker exists &#8212; a random lottery &#8212; it rarely is invoked because distances are calculated to one hundredth of a mile for purposes of the preceding tiebreaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parents Involved in Community Schools (\"Parents\") is \"a nonprofit corporation formed by parents whose children have been or may be denied admission to the high schools of their choosing solely because of race.\" It commenced this legal action in July of 2000, contending that the School District's use of the racial tiebreaker for high school admissions is illegal under both state and federal law. Specifically, Parents alleged that by using race to decide who will be admitted to the oversubscribed high schools, the School District engages in illegal racial discrimination prohibited by the Washington Civil Rights Act (\"Initiative 200\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Parents and the School District moved for summary judgment on all claims; neither contended that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment. In a published opinion dated April 6, 2001, the district court upheld the use of the racial tiebreaker under both state and federal law, granting the School District's motion and denying the Parents's. <i>See Parents Involved I, 137 F.Supp.2d at 1240.</i> Parents timely filed an appeal in this court and, on April 16, 2002, we issued an opinion reversing the district court's decision. Acting \"in our constitutionally ordained role as oracles of Washington law,\" <i>Parents Involved II,</i> 285 F.3d at 1243, we prophesied that the School District's use of the racial tiebreaker violated Initiative 200. <i>Id.</i> at 1244.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Simultaneously, we enjoined the School District from using the racial tiebreaker in its system of high school admissions pending further order from this court. <i>Id.</i> at 1257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the School District's petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc were pending before us, it \"bec[a]me clear that [we could not] provide a definitive [legal] answer before assignments [were to] be made for the 2002-03 year, and therefore, ... that our sole reason for not certifying this question to the Washington Supreme Court ha[d] dissolved.\" <i>Parents Involved III,</i> 294 F.3d at 1086. Consequently, we granted the petition for rehearing, withdrew our opinion, and vacated our injunction. <i>See id.</i> Simultaneously, we entered an order certifying to the Supreme Court of Washington the question whether</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[b]y using a racial tiebreaker to determine high school assignments, [the] Seattle School District Number 1 \"discriminate[s] against, or grant[s] preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, ... color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public education\" in violation of Initiative 200.... ?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1087.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Washington accepted certification, heard oral argument in the matter, and on June 26, 2003 issued an opinion concluding that I-200 \"does not prohibit the Seattle School District's open choice plan tie breaker based upon race so long as it remains neutral on race and ethnicity and does not promote a less qualified minority applicant over a more qualified applicant.\" <i>Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,</i> 149 Wash.2d 660, 72 P.3d 151, 166 (2003). It therefore \"return[ed] the case to the federal court for further proceedings consistent with [its] resolution of the questions of Washington law,\" <i>id.</i> at 167, and formally notified this court of its actions by delivery of a Certificate of Finality on September 8, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All state law issues having been definitively decided, the parties prepared supplemental briefing on the remaining federal constitutional question in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decisions in the University of Michigan affirmative actions cases &#8212; <i>Gratz v.

Article III's case-or-controversy requirement mandates that the parties to a federal court action must \"continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit\" at all stages of the proceedings. <i>United States v. Verdin,</i> 243 F.3d 1174, 1177 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"This means that, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (quoting <i>Lewis v. Cont'l Bank Corp.,</i> 494 U.S. 472, 477-478, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990)). As with any jurisdictional inquiry &#8212; and notwithstanding the parties' unhesitating agreement that Parents's action remains a live controversy appropriately subject to federal adjudication on the merits &#8212; we are charged with an independent constitutional responsibility to verify our authority to resolve their litigation. <i>See Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020, 1025 (9th Cir.1999)</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, we have little doubt that the associational aspect of Parents's standing has not been mooted. At reargument, counsel for Parents informed us that several of the association's members have children who, over the course of the next several years, will be applying for admission to the School District's public high schools and who thus will be subject to the admissions policies established by the School Board. Because \"some members of the [association] [c]ould [continue to] have ... standing to bring this suit in their own right,\" <i>Int'l Union, United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock,</i> 477 U.S. 274, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2523, 91 L.Ed.2d 228 (1986), and because the passage of time has not called into question Parents's satisfaction of the other requirements for associational standing, <i>see Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000)</i>, we are satisfied that the associational aspect of Parents's standing has continued vitality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps more troubling, however, is the disclosure that the School District is not currently employing &#8212; and has not since the 2001-02 school year employed &#8212; the racial tiebreaker that Parents challenge in this litigation. As noted earlier, we enjoined the School District's use of the racial tiebreaker with our initial disposition of this case. <i>See Parents Involved II, 285 F.3d at 1257.</i> And although we vacated that injunction with the withdrawal of our initial opinion, <i>see Parents Involved III, 294 F.3d at 1086,</i> the School District has voluntarily declined to reinstate its racial tiebreaker during the pendency of this litigation. With the passage of time, the voters of Seattle have elected a new School Board,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and there is at least a remote possibility that the new Board will opt not to resume its use of the racial tiebreaker that prompted this lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, it is beyond cavil that \"`a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice' unless it is `<i>absolutely clear</i> that the allegedly wrongful behavior <i>could not reasonably be expected to recur.</i>'\" <i>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Res.,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 609, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (emphases added) (quoting <i>Friends of the Earth,</i> 528 U.S. at 189, 120 S.Ct. 693, with internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Indeed, in these circumstances, a \"heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again <i>lies with the party asserting mootness.</i>\" <i>Adarand Const., Inc. v. Slater,</i> 528 U.S. 216, 222, 120 S.Ct. 722, 145 L.Ed.2d 650 (2000) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The problem here, of course, is that <i>neither party</i> has asserted that this case is moot: When asked at oral argument about the possibility that we lack jurisdiction over Parents's action, counsel for the School District not only maintained that this controversy remains live, but questioned whether the Board would have him defend the racial tiebreaker if it did not intend to reinstate the challenged policy in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, where a court must address <i>sua sponte</i> the possibility that the passage of time has mooted litigation <i>on alternative grounds</i> (for instance, that the associational aspect of a plaintiff's standing no longer satisfies Article III jurisdictional requirements), we find it hard to imagine that a defendant's <i>voluntary cessation</i> could <i>ever</i> operate itself to moot the underlying litigation. By virtue of the fact that neither party will have alleged mootness in the first instance, there is no one to \"satisfy the heavy burden of persuasion\" that well-established doctrinal precepts require <i>a party</i> to demonstrate before voluntary cessation can be held to moot a once live case or controversy. <i>See United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S.Ct. 361, 21 L.Ed.2d 344 (1968)</i>. We therefore conclude that the present case remains live.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the heart of Parents's claim: that the School District's use of race to determine who will be admitted to its oversubscribed public high schools constitutes illegal racial discrimination in violation of both the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Forged in the crucible of Reconstruction and \"[p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering,\" <i>Adarand Const., Inc. v.

These myriad interests include the School District's desires to achieve: \"the educational benefits of attending a racially and ethnically diverse school\"; \"integration of schools which, as a result of housing patterns and the tendency of many parents to choose schools close to home, would otherwise tend to become racially isolated\"; \"ensuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American society\"; \"alleviating de facto segregation\"; \"increasing racial and cultural understanding\"; \"avoiding racial isolation\"; fostering \"cross-racial friendships\"; and \"reduc[ing] prejudice and increas[ing] understanding of cultural differences.\" Perhaps its most articulate statement supporting use of the racial tiebreaker is the School Board's policy \"Statement Reaffirming [the] Diversity Rationale.\" It explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diversity in the classroom increases the likelihood that students will discuss racial or ethnic issues and be more likely to socialize with people of different races.

The District is also committed to providing students with the opportunity to voluntarily choose to attend a school to promote integration. The District provides these opportunities for students to attend a racially and ethnically diverse school, and to assist in the voluntary integration of a school, because it believes that providing a diverse learning environment is educationally beneficial for all students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent Parents once may have been able to make out a colorable claim that the only interest sufficiently compelling to justify the use of racial classifications is the remediation of past official discrimination,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> such an argument no longer obtains.

In support of its racial tiebreaker, the School District invokes precisely the interest sanctioned by the Supreme Court: securing those benefits. Those benefits are as compelling in the high school context as they are in higher education. We therefore conclude that the District has satisfied its first burden under strict scrutiny: It has articulated a compelling interest in pursuit of which it seeks to use a racial classification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, to hold that the School District has invoked a compelling interest in pursuit of which it seeks to employ the racial tiebreaker is merely to begin our inquiry. Because\" `racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification,'\" <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 270, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (quoting <i>Fullilove,</i> 448 U.S. at 537, 100 S.Ct. 2758 (Stevens, J., dissenting)), the School District also bears the burden of demonstrating that its use of the racial tiebreaker is narrowly-tailored to further that interest. <i>See Hunter, 190 F.3d at 1063; Ho,</i> 147 F.3d at 865. As with respect to compelling interest analysis, <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz</i> shed much-needed light on the once crepuscular contours of the narrow tailoring test applicable to the non-remedial use of racial preferences in educational admissions. Careful attention to these decisions &#8212; and the ways they addressed the divergent undergraduate and law school admissions schemes at the University of Michigan &#8212; is especially warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* As <i>Grutter</i> outlined, the admissions process at the University of Michigan Law School functions roughly as follows. Every completed application received by the Law School is both read and considered holistically by admissions officials. A significant focus of the decisionmakers is on an applicant's academic ability, as measured by his or her undergraduate grade point average and score on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Even so, these \"hard\" measures are insufficient to resolve admissions decisions: Just as \"the highest score does not guarantee admission[, neither] does a low score disqualify an applicant.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 315, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Instead, admissions officials must look beyond those measures to \"soft\" variables, including \"the enthusiasm of the [applicant's] recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant's essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection,\" which in turn are used to help measure \"an applicant's likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This focus on \"soft\" variables aims to ensure that the Law School can \"`achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone's education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting the Law School's written admissions policy). While recognizing that there are \"`many possible bases for diversity admissions,'\" the admissions policy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"reaffirm[s] the Law School's longstanding commitment to `one particular type of diversity,' that is, `racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against..., who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 316, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting policy). Of note, the policy seeks to ensure the enrollment of a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students through the use of a calibrated racial preference &#8212; in the absence of which such students would comprise just 4 percent of the law school's entering class, and thereby be less likely as a group fully to \"`make unique contributions to the character of the Law School.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting policy). Crucially, \"[t]he policy does not define diversity `solely in terms of racial and ethnic status,'\" <i>id.</i> (quoting policy), but rather gives \"serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the constitutionality of the program, Justice O'Connor immediately honed in on its core features: its flexibility and breadth. In concert with the baseline constitutional prohibition against quotas, <i>id.</i> at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (\"[A] race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system &#8212; it cannot `insulate each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants.'\") (quoting <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 315, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Powell, J., concurring)), the law school \"consider[s] race [and] ethnicity more flexibly as a `plus' factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, she explained, the Law School's policy strenuously avoids evaluating individual applicants \"in a way that makes [their] race or ethnicity the defining feature of [their] application.\" <i>Id.</i> at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Conforming to the \"paramount\" constitutional requirement of truly \"individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program,\" <i>id.</i> at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325, the Law School's admissions officers shun a \"policy, either <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto,</i> of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any `soft' variable,\" and awards \"no mechanical, predetermined diversity `bonuses' based on race or ethnicity.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite in contrast, the school refuses to \"limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity,\" <i>id.</i> at 338, 123 S.Ct. 2325, and illustrates the strength of its commitment to that principle by highlighting a variety of non-racial criteria the institution considers valuable &#8212; for instance, that an applicant has lived or traveled abroad, speaks more than one language, has overcome personal adversity, or has a strong record of community service or even a prior career in a non-legal profession. <i>Id.</i> (discussing policy). And the Law School pays more than mere lip service to this commitment: It \"actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race,\" allowing those factors to \"make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well.\" <i>Id.</i> In short, the law school's admissions program \"considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race,\" <i>id.</i> at 340, 123 S.Ct. 2325, and as a consequence, \"does not unduly harm nonminority applicants.\" <i>Id.</i> at 341, 123 S.Ct. 2325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Court observed that the Law School has \"sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives,\" <i>id.</i> at 340, 123 S.Ct. 2325, and that periodic reviews (along with an eventual legal cutoff) ensure that the Law School's use of race will be time-limited, in concert with the Constitution's demand that any \"`deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial groups [be] a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quoting <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 510, 109 S.Ct. 706 (plurality opinion)). In light of the policy's careful design and its adherence to the strict limits placed on the non-remedial use of race, the Court upheld the Law School's program as narrowly tailored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in <i>Gratz</i>, however, the undergraduate admissions program at the University's College of Literature, Sciences, and the Arts (LSA) &#8212; though purportedly pursuing the same benefits from diversity as the Law School &#8212; had structured its admissions program around such a crude racial classification that the school had not even come close to satisfying the narrow tailoring requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Prior to its 1998 admissions cycle, LSA developed an admissions \"selection index\" that assigned each applicant a score of up to 150 points based on his or her grades, test scores, high school quality and curricular rigor, in-state residency, legacy status, personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership. The index was then divided into strict dispositional bands: students scoring 100-150 points were admitted; students scoring 95-99 points were either admitted or had consideration of their application postponed; students scoring 90-94 points either had consideration of their application postponed or were admitted; students scoring 75-89 points were delayed or postponed; and students scoring fewer than 75 points were delayed or rejected. <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 255, 123 S.Ct. 2411.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the LSA system superficially appeared to provide for individualized consideration of each applicant &#8212; at least to the extent that each application was reviewed to ascertain the presence of various \"soft\" variables for mechanical scoring &#8212; such a rosy portrait was belied by the underlying reality of the policy. Tucked into a \"`miscellaneous' category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his or her membership in an under-represented racial or ethnic minority group.\" <i>Id.</i> Indeed, during 1999 and 2000, \"every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group was awarded 20 points,\" <i>id.</i> at 256, 123 S.Ct. 2411, at least one-fifth of the points necessary to secure admission to LSA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It therefore is not surprising that the Court rejected LSA's program on narrow tailoring grounds.

The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups. Moreover, unlike Justice Powell's example, where the race of a `particular black applicant' could be considered without being decisive, the LSA's automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making `the factor of race ... decisive' for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 272, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (quoting <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 317, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Powell, J., concurring)); <i>see also id. at 273, 98 S.Ct. 2733</i> (\"[A]s the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified underrepresented minority applicant is admitted.\"). Having so easily concluded that the LSA policy was not narrowly tailored, the Court concluded by swiftly rejecting the University's lame suggestion that \"`the volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical'\" to predicate admissions on individualized consideration. <i>Id.</i> at 275, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (quoting LSA's Brief). \"[T]he fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 508, 109 S.Ct. 706).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the Court's decisions in <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz</i> &#8212; and drawing upon well-established narrow tailoring principles &#8212; we derive the following governing constraints.

As <i>Grutter</i> defined that forbidden fruit of non-remedial racial preferences, \"Quotas impose a fixed number or percentage which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded, and insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 335, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (citations and quotations omitted). Yet this is almost precisely how the District <i>itself</i> has described the operation of its program &#8212; with a single variance: rather than impose a racial floor <i>or</i> ceiling, the School District's racial tiebreaker establishes both a floor <i>and</i> a ceiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f an oversubscribed school has fewer than 45 [percent] students of color/more than 55 [percent] whites, students of color will be assigned ahead of white students who live closer to the school.

Gratz, 539 U.S. at 270, 123 S.Ct. 2411</i> (\"[T]he University's policy, which automatically distributes ... <i>one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission</i> ... to every single `underrepresented minority' applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored....\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 271-72, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (\"The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups.\"). Thus, in stark contrast to the program sanctioned by <i>Grutter,</i> the racial tiebreaker not only fails to \"serious[ly] consider[ ] all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment,\" but is in fact a \"<i>de jure</i> [policy] of automatic acceptance or rejection based on a[ ] single `soft' variable.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325. This the Constitution categorically forbids; such an impliably reflexive use of race \"cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal, except perhaps outright racial balancing.\" <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 507, 109 S.Ct. 706 (plurality opinion).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>c</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, although numerous alternative admissions structures have been proposed to solve the School District's oversubscription dilemma without so prominently featuring race in the equation, not all have been (or ever were) seriously considered by the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Three such alternatives stand out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>i</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the School Board has never seriously considered the use of a citywide high school admissions lottery. Though perhaps not palatable to the electorate &#8212; a consideration that cannot justify the use of race in its stead &#8212; a randomized lottery would necessarily produce levels of school diversity statistically comparable to (and perhaps even more proportional than) the District's racial tiebreaker. Yet, when asked about using a lottery to meet the District's diversity targets, Board member Barbara Schaad-Lamphere actually argued that a lottery would <i>not</i> result in racially proportional representation \"because of probabilities, the law of probabilities.\" Let us be clear: We are not forcing the School District to <i>adopt</i> a random assignment lottery. But given its evident commitment to achieving diversity, there is no question but that the Board should have <i>earnestly appraised</i> such a program's costs and benefits. Whatever reasons there may be to reject a lottery, the demonstrably false pretext that \"the law of probabilities\" would render it ineffectual is not one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent takes us to task for suggesting that the School District must seriously consider using a lottery to achieve its diversity goals when <i>Grutter</i> itself explicitly rejected the plaintiffs' claim that Michigan's Law School should have considered a lottery. <i>See post</i> at 1009-1010. We find such criticism unavailing. <i>Grutter</i> rejected the plaintiffs' demand that the Law School consider a lottery because such a program would necessarily diminish the quality of its admitted students and might not produce adequate educational diversity due to potential under-representation of various (not necessarily racial) kinds of diversity in its limited applicant pool.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Yet as the dissent <i>itself</i> notes, the School District's adoption of a lottery is subject to neither of these potential pitfalls. <i>Post</i> at 1000 (noting that in this case \"there is absolutely no competition or consideration of merit.... <i>All</i> high school students must and will be placed in a Seattle public school. The students' relative merit is irrelevant.\") (emphasis in original). As a result, the District's unconstrained applicant pool is not subject to a possible demographic skew, and there is absolutely no possibility that a lottery would diminish the quality of admitted students. Thus, neither of <i>Grutter's</i> grounds for rejecting consideration of a lottery is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ii</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the School District could have considered adopting a diversity-oriented policy that does not rely exclusively on race, but which instead accounts for the wider array of characteristics that comprise the kind of true diversity lauded by Justice Powell in <i>Bakke</i> and by the Court in <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz.</i> In this respect, we observe that &#8212; for purposes of its internal school funding formula &#8212; the School District already collects a much wider array of data on students and families than merely their racial and ethnic identities. Among that data is information on whether a child lives at home or in \"an agency\"; if she lives at home, with whom; whether the child's home and most proficient languages are English or some other language; and the child's eligibility for free or reduced price lunch. Yet, the District considers none of those factors in admissions, and although individual Board members have occasionally suggested using one or more of those factors as an alternative tiebreaker, the Board has declined even to study how such an alternative would impact school diversity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent once again strays in its criticism of this suggestion. It first suggests that a programmatic focus on \"true diversity\" is no alternative at all \"because it is not directed toward achieving the District's interest in a racially integrated learning environment.\" <i>Post</i> at 1008. But this claim is fundamentally mistaken. A programmatic focus on true diversity &#8212; within which race is one of many factors considered by the School District &#8212; <i>subsumes</i> the District's interest in achieving racial diversity: It does not <i>supplant</i> it. Indeed, such a focus may not only help the District achieve the racial diversity it desires, <i>see infra</i> at 1001 n. 26, but might actually serve the District's socialization interests to a far greater degree than its presently narrow focus on race alone. For, if the District's fundamental interest is, as the dissent characterizes it, \"to prepare children to be good citizens &#8212; to socialize children and to inculcate civic values,\" <i>see post</i> at 992, and to achieve \"a more democratic and inclusive experience for all citizens,\" <i>id.</i> at 991-92 n. 9 (quoting one of the District's expert witnesses), then accounting for factors other than race &#8212; like socioeconomic status &#8212; would bolster the District's \"democratic\" mission by fostering, for instance, cross-class (and not just cross-racial) interaction. <i>See</i> Richard D. Kahlenberg, <i>All Together Now: Creating Middle-Class Schools Through Public School Choice (2001)</i> (documenting the civic and educational benefits of socioeconomically integrated schooling).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also errs in suggesting that \"even though there has been no formal study of [this] proposal,\" the deposition testimony of a few Board members is sufficient to demonstrate \"legitimate reasons why the majority of the Board rejected the use of poverty measures....\" <i>Post</i> at 1008. We disagree. The Board members' blithe dismissal of a sincerely presented proposal simply cannot satisfy the constitutional requirement that the government earnestly appraise race-minimal alternatives prior to adopting race-conscious policies. Matters not formally evaluated cannot be \"rejected\" in a constitutionally-relevant sense: Such appraisal &#8212; whether with regard to the need for race-based action, or to the shape such action is to take &#8212; must be conducted \"on the record.\" <i>See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-511, 109 S.Ct. 706</i> (chronicling Richmond's failure adequately to document the basis for its use and design of a racial quota and stressing the constitutional demand that it do so); <i>see also Shaw v.

In September 2000, they developed &#8212; and then formally proposed to the School Board &#8212; a comprehensive plan that would seek to enhance the quality of education in the City's schools by focusing on educational organization, teacher quality, parent-teacher interaction, raising curricular standards, substantially broadening the availability of specialized and magnet programs (which could attract a broader cross-section of students to undersubscribed schools), and supporting extra-curricular development.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, their plan proposed decreasing the School District's reliance on race in the admissions process by adding a new, primary tiebreaker based on pairing neighborhoods with particular schools and structuring the scope and size of the component residential areas such that no single region would contain enough students to fill its linked high school to capacity. Under the plan, preferences initially would be given to students choosing a school in their paired region, and the existing racial tiebreaker would be dropped from second to third in the process of resolving any remaining oversubscription (and any residual racial concentration not already solved by improving the attractiveness of previously racially concentrated schools). Finally, the Urban League working group proposed that the School District add an eleventh public high school, and that it strenuously market to the public the existing (and proposed additional) specialty programs throughout the City's other high schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot know whether its proposed reforms would have been successful in achieving the working group's ambitious goals, but there is no doubt that the Urban League presented the Board with an especially thoughtful proposal for addressing the dilemmas plaguing contemporary urban education<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> while simultaneously striving to attain educational diversity without unduly relying on the use of crude racial preferences.

Over time, \"the band,\" <i>see supra</i> n. 6, has ranged from as much as +/25 percent to as little as +/10 percent, and it currently sits at +/15 percent. And while such variances conceivably could be interpreted to suggest that the School District is carefully trying to optimize its realization of diversity's benefits, the record belies such an interpretation. In October 2000, School Superintendent Joseph Olchefske formally recommended that the band be expanded from +/10 percent to +/20 percent because \"[a]fter review and 2 years experience, there was not strong evidence that utilizing a +/10 [percent] band provided a materially better educational experience than would a band of +/20 [percent]. Accordingly, in order to fulfill our narrow tailoring obligation, staff is recommending a +/20 [percent] band.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Yet, even after its chief educator and his staff twice had reported that twice as much of an adjustment would have no adverse impact on the diversity payoff, the Board adjusted the band by just 5 percentage points. This is not the measure of tailored proportionality. Instead, it represents a stubborn adherence to the use of race for race's sake, with the effect that some non-preferred student applicants will be displaced solely because of their racial and ethnic identities &#8212; to no benefit at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken alone, any of these shortcomings would doom the School District's program.

[The] argument that race may be considered [only] in a holistic individualized review as one factor among many contributing to diversity is not applicable to non-selective school assignments.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Indeed, they argue, the use of racial classifications in their allegedly \"non-zero sum\" open choice high school admissions process \"is narrowly tailored, as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For support, they unearth language from <i>Associated General Contractors of California v. San Francisco Unified School District,</i> a 1980 case in which we addressed a challenge to a School Board policy requiring that \"bidders for construction contracts ... must be minority general contractors or must utilize minority subcontractors for 25[percent] in dollar volume of the contract work.\" 616 F.2d 1381, 1383 (9th Cir.1980). At the heart of their challenge, the contractors asserted that the quota violated California law requiring that all school contracts (except those involving <i>de minimis</i> expenditures) be awarded solely to \"the lowest responsible bidder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1385 (discussing and quoting Cal. Educ.Code &#167; 39640). In defense, the School Board asserted not only that its policy was <i>permissible,</i> but that the policy was <i>required</i> in order to remedy past discrimination &#8212; and therefore that insofar as it would prevent maintenance of such a policy, California's low-bid law violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, &#167; 2. <i>Id.</i> at 1386.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We flatly rejected that argument, drawing a distinction between \"reshuffle programs\" and \"stacked deck programs,\" <i>id.</i> at 1386, and placing the Board's quota in the latter category of race-based policies. We explained the central difference between these two categories as follows: While reshuffle programs \"neither give[ ] to nor withhold[ ] from anyone any benefits because of that person's group status, but rather ensure[] that everyone in every group enjoys the same rights in the same place,\" so-called stacked deck programs \"specifically favor[ ] members of minorities in the competition with members of the majority for benefits that the state can give to some citizens but not to all.\" <i>Id.</i> In passing, we twice suggested that programs designed to desegregate schools are reshuffle programs, <i>see id. at 1386 &amp; 1387,</i> and elsewhere stated \"that `stacked deck' programs trench on Fourteenth Amendment values in ways that `reshuffle' programs do not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1387.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we held simply that although \"the state has an affirmative constitutional duty to use `reshuffle' programs to cure the effects of past or present <i>de jure</i> segregation..., there is no constitutional duty to engage in `stacked deck' affirmative action.\" <i>Id.</i> Of particular import, we never reached the Fourteenth Amendment question squarely implicated by this case: whether notwithstanding the absence of an obligation to adopt such a policy, its implementation of such a program was permissible. Instead, given our resolution of an underlying state law question, our assessment of that law's constitutionality, and the fact that the Court recently had granted certiorari in <i>Fullilove,</i> we <i>explicitly</i> declined to \"test the policy itself against the standard of the United States Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it might seem obvious that a case cannot control the resolution of an issue it expressly declined to confront, the School District nonetheless grasps at <i>Associated General's</i> furtive references to school desegregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> It argues that its racial classification is equivalent to the programs arguably favored by <i>Associated General,</i> and thus (reading that opinion at the highest level of generality) not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us begin with two interrelated observations. First, <i>Associated General</i> addressed neither school desegregation nor the use of race in educational admissions; it assessed a mechanical set-aside governing distribution of construction projects. Second, <i>Associated General</i> did not even purport to apply strict scrutiny to a particular racial classification (or, more specifically, an actual school desegregation program). Its Fourteenth Amendment analysis assessed only whether the use of certain types of classifications is required to remediate prior official race discrimination &#8212; not whether constitutional limits circumscribe the use of such classifications for non-remedial purposes, what those limits might be, and how they might affect the constitutionality of a particular policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two conclusions follow. First, <i>Associated General</i> sheds no light on how we are to apply the narrow tailoring analysis rendered applicable to <i>any</i> racial classification by <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 493-95, 109 S.Ct. 706, <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 224, 115 S.Ct. 2097, <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325, and <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 270, 123 S.Ct. 2411,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> to the tiebreaker at issue in this case. And second, <i>Associated General's</i> assertions about the nature of school desegregation programs are &#8212; however one defines the term &#8212; <i>obiter dicta.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the School District argues that because reshuffle programs may be less invidious than stacked deck programs and thus, as a constitutional matter, somehow not subject to the stringencies of the narrow tailoring requirement &#8212; a proposition never embraced by this court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> and certainly not one reconcilable with binding Supreme Court holdings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> &#8212; it misapprehends the concept of narrow tailoring. The contours of narrow tailoring do not turn on the importance of the interest supporting the government's use of a racial classification (though such analysis, whatever its shape, surely is triggered by use of a racial classification in pursuit of a compelling interest), nor on the asserted degree of the intrusion that a particular use of race might render. The personal right to equal treatment is implicated any time the government employs race for any reason. <i>See Coalition, 122 F.3d at 702</i> (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 230, 115 S.Ct. 2097).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, narrow tailoring analysis focuses only upon the fit between the ends in pursuit of which a racial classification is used, the particular way in which the policy at issue uses that racial classification, and the baseline legal limits placed upon the use of racial classifications &#8212; and it does so because any policy using race, for any reason and in any way, is \"inherently suspect,\" \"by [its] very nature odious to a free people,\" and simply \"too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 223, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (quoting <i>Fullilove,</i> 448 U.S. at 523, 100 S.Ct. 2758 (Stewart, J., dissenting)); <i>id.</i> at 224, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (quoting <i>Hirabayashi,</i> 320 U.S. at 100, 63 S.Ct. 1375); <i>id.</i> 229, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (quoting <i>Fullilove,</i> 448 U.S. at 537, 100 S.Ct. 2758 (Stevens, J., dissenting)). It is for those reasons that, as Judge Selya &#8212; in typically perspicuous fashion &#8212; has observed, a court applying strict scrutiny must focus on \"whether the concrete workings of the Policy merit constitutional sanction. Only by such particularized attention can we ascertain whether the Policy bears any necessary relation to the noble ends it espouses. In short, the devil is in the details.\" <i>Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 798. Under strict scrutiny, no racial classification, no matter its context and no matter the nature or strength of the interest it serves, is exempt from the strictures of narrow tailoring, and this program plainly fails to satisfy them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if were we to accept that <i>Associated General</i> bears on this case, we observe that the School District's racial tiebreaker operates as a \"stacked deck\" program. Quite simply, it \"specifically favors members of [some races] in the competition with members of [other races] for benefits that the state can give to some citizens but not to all,\" <i>Associated General,</i> 616 F.2d at 1386 &#8212; here, of course, admission to particular high schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> As noted earlier, operation of the tiebreaker at Franklin causes whites to be admitted preferentially because they <i>are</i> white, and its operation at Ballard causes non-whites to be admitted preferentially simply because they <i>are not</i> white. To the argument that this program is \"non-selective,\" we can only express bewilderment: The racial tiebreaker is used to determine student admissions solely to oversubscribed &#8212; <i>and thus necessarily selective</i> &#8212; schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> Whatever <i>Associated General</i> says about school desegregation programs, this is not the programmatic design that we had in mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having accepted the School District's invocation of <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz</i> in support of the proposition that racial and ethnic diversity can generate constitutionally compelling benefits within the educational setting itself and our society at large, we ultimately are compelled to reject the School District's strained efforts both to eat its cake and have it too. Its racial tiebreaker &#8212; though enlisted in the service of admittedly worthy ends &#8212; plainly fails the narrow tailoring component of the Constitution's strict scrutiny test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approaching this case from a fundamentally divergent perspective, the dissent offers a spirited and thoughtful defense of the School District's racial tiebreaker. Although we have responded to a few of its more specific criticisms, we see little to gain from the kind of note-by-note combat so pervasive in modern judicial opinions. Rather, given the thoroughness with which we have articulated our respective analyses of the racial tiebreaker, we think there is more to gain by elucidating the core foundations of our dispute. We perceive three significant points of departure, and address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The dissent repeatedly suggests that we should simply defer to the School District's decision to employ its tiebreaker in pursuing racial proportionality. <i>Post</i> at 993-94 n. 13, 995-96, 996-98 &amp; 1007-1008. Indeed, the dissent gradually shifts from noting how \"compelling\" the District's policy is to focusing on its \"reasonable[ness],\" \"legitima[cy],\" and \"permissi [bility].\" <i>Id.</i> at 993-94 n. 13, 1005, 1008, 1008, 1009, 1013. We believe such unfettered deference is inconsistent with our obligations under strict scrutiny &#8212; and, contrary to the dissent, that it is especially inconsistent with constitutional demands in this context. Because <i>Grutter's</i> decision to accord universities a measure of deference occasioned a sharp debate over this issue, careful attention to its rationale for doing so is in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* After identifying the Law School's \"compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body,\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325, the Court promptly stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Law School's <i>educational judgment</i> that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer....

It then expressly sanctioned Justice Powell's statement in <i>Bakke</i> that, given these unique First Amendment interests, universities have a \"right to select those students who will contribute the most to the `robust exchange of ideas.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 313, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (Powell, J., concurring)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deference thus was due to the University not because its interest was \"simply to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin ... but [because it] was defined by reference to the educational benefits that [such] diversity is designed to produce,\" <i>id.</i> (quotations and citations omitted) &#8212; and of crucial importance, because <i>those</i> \"educational benefits\" were not merely socially compelling, <i>id.</i> at 330-33, 123 S.Ct. 2325, but fundamentally <i>internal</i> to the university's \"academic\" mission. <i>Id.</i> at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The Court emphasized: \"The benefits are important and laudable, because classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting when the students have the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the fact that <i>Grutter</i> deferred only to the Law School's identification of its interests as compelling &#8212; and, contrary to the dissent here, not to its tailoring analysis &#8212; neither of <i>Grutter's</i> grounds for affording deference is present here. First, secondary schools do not occupy the same \"special niche in our constitutional tradition\" as higher education, and the Court has never held they possess a similar First Amendment right of academic freedom. Indeed, while the Court has been willing to afford secondary schools some limited leeway to enable them to meet their most basic need (preserving the orderly school environment necessary to enable academic learning<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>), the Court has never suggested that public secondary schools have a constitutional right to select their student body, much less that such a right entails selecting students based solely on their race &#8212; a power that not even universities enjoy, despite <i>their</i> uniquely privileged status. Quite in contrast, the Court has repeatedly condemned racial balancing, held that a State's creation of a system of compulsory public education endows <i>students</i> (not schools) with a constitutionally-protected interest, and has pointedly reminded school authorities that \"`[t]he Fourteenth Amendment ... protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures &#8212; Boards of Education not excepted.'\" <i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 574, 95 S.Ct. 729 (quoting <i>W. Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 637, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943)); <i>see also Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 330 &amp; 336, 123 S.Ct. 2325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the principal benefits the School District seeks through its pursuit of racial proportionality are neither internal to the school environment nor within the special expertise of school administrators. For although the District's asserted interests in the educational and societal benefits derivable from diverse schools mirror those embraced by <i>Grutter, see supra</i> at 960-65, the dissent quite properly notes that the School District has an appreciably different focus. Rather than primarily seeking the <i>internal academic benefits</i> of diversity, the District's chief focus is on the <i>broader social benefits</i> diversity can stimulate. <i>See post</i> at 991-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe this divergent emphasis changes the nature of the District's interests; they remain compelling, and thus can justify an appropriately limited use of race. <i>See supra</i> Sections III.B.3 &amp; III.C.3. But it does affect the degree to which the District can claim deference. With regard to its secondary pursuit of diversity's internal academic benefits, we believe that while limited deference to educational institutions arguably could be due when they pursue core goals, such deference is entirely unwarranted when they court tangential ones. Having proceeded from the premise that the internal academic benefits of diversity are secondary to the District's socialization mission, it is at best curious that the dissent nonetheless maintains we should defer to the District's particularly crude use of a most disfavored classification in their pursuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far more important, we see a crucial difference between a school's pursuit of the internal academic benefits of diversity and its pursuit of diversity's external social benefits. For although the former manifest within the District's schoolhouses, and thus are susceptible to ready appraisal exclusively by education policymakers, the \"democratic\" benefits attributable to classroom diversity are diffuse, manifest long after students leave the classroom, do so in contexts not subject to the exclusive oversight of teachers, and cannot be measured with skills possessed uniquely by educators. That is to say: While it is clear that educators are uniquely positioned to gauge how classroom discussions respond to shifts in classroom racial composition, they are not similarly well-positioned to assess how marginal changes in schoolhouse racial demographics affect how students interact with each other years after they leave school for the \"real world.\" And to the limited extent they may have such insight, the record does not suggest the District <i>ever</i> sought to appraise the long-term social effects of engineering proportional demographic changes in connection with its design of the tiebreaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the dissent's unfettered deference to the School District &#8212; a constitutional departure that we think undermines its supposed \"strict scrutiny\" of the tiebreaker &#8212; one of its most striking features is its lack of focus on the data. For if it is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, there are times when statistics give Proust a run for his money.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The dissent simply seems to assume that absent the racial tiebreaker, Seattle's public high schools would be \"racially concentrated, or racially isolated,\" and thus unable to attain diversity's benefits. <i>Post</i> at 993; <i>id.</i> at 1001-1002, 1009-1010, 1011 &amp; n. 39.

The range in representation of Asians at the tiebreaker schools (19.3 percent, as Asian representation ranged from just 17.5 percent of students at Ballard to a whopping 36.8 percent of students at Franklin) was more than 3 times the size of the tiebreaker's <i>maximum</i> annual impact on overall white/non-white ratios; and the range in black representation (24.6 percent, ranging from 32.3 percent of students at Franklin to just 7.7 percent of students at Roosevelt) was more than 4 times the <i>maximum</i> annual white/non-white impact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> &amp;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These representational variances cut to the core of the dissent's defense of the tiebreaker's design. For if the tiebreaker's goal is (as the dissent characterizes it) to assure every student the opportunity to interact with the right ratio of different-looking peers in order to prepare them for life in our diverse society, the program plainly fails huge numbers of students. Consider: Roughly 600 black students at Garfield during the 2000-2001 school year were deprived of the chance to interact with a sufficient number of Asian students (12.5 percent of Garfield students versus 27.5 percent of students in the school population at large); more than 100 Latino students at Roosevelt were denied a chance to interact with an adequate number of African-American peers (7.1 percent of Roosevelt students versus 22.8 percent of the student population at large); 600 Asian students at Franklin were unable adequately to interact with Native American students (0.8 percent of Franklin students versus 2.5 percent of the student population at large). And thousands of other students left their schools not having been <i>inadequately exposed</i> to interaction with certain racial minorities, but rather having been <i>overexposed</i> to them &#8212; and thus likewise <i>not</i> having been readied \"to be effective participants in the racially diverse environment in which they exist.\" <i>Cf. post</i> at 1010-1011. Even taking at face value the dissent's embrace of racial balancing, these data indicate the tiebreaker does not even rationally further the impermissible ends the dissent trumpets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final major point of departure between our opinion and the dissent is perhaps the most significant: We believe the dissent errs in failing to recognize the injury rendered by the tiebreaker. We have already explained that the individual right to equal treatment is implicated any time government uses race to apportion benefits or burdens. Here, in determining where some 300 students will attend high school, the School District crudely approximates the shades of their skin and assigns them to schools accordingly. Nonetheless, the dissent surprisingly suggests that not one of those students suffers a legally cognizable injury (whether such an injury can be justified or not) because the constitutional prohibitions against determinative racial preferences and quotas do not apply to secondary education, and because each of those students will get a basic education anyway. We address these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The dissent suggests that the constitutional prohibitions against determinative racial preferences and quotas do not apply within the secondary educational context because secondary schools do not employ race as a proxy for merit, and thus pose little risk of stigmatizing or stereotyping those they putatively benefit. <i>Post</i> at 999-1002. Its analysis cannot be squared with precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has long prohibited the use of outright quotas in contexts where merit and qualification are &#8212; as the dissent asserts them to be here &#8212; completely irrelevant. Thus, <i>Croson</i> rejected Richmond's racial quota for construction contracts on grounds that the \"quota cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal, except perhaps outright racial balancing.\" <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 507, 109 S.Ct. 706. Of course, when dealing with contracting, the only \"qualification\" or indicum of \"merit\" is submission of a low bid. <i>Croson's</i> constitutional objection to the City's use of a quota was thus not that it threatened to stigmatize minorities: It was that quota-driven racial balancing is flatly at odds with the Fourteenth Amendment's\" `ultimate goal' of `eliminat[ing] entirely from governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human being's race.\" <i>Id.</i> at 500, 109 S.Ct. 706 (quoting <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U.S. at 320, 106 S.Ct. 1842 (Stevens, J., dissenting)) (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, courts have rejected the use of race-based quotas in legislative redistricting. As the Fifth Circuit has put the point, \"[D]istricters are not bound &#8212; or allowed &#8212; to sacrifice traditional districting concerns to meeting quotas of diversity, just as they are not allowed to do so in order to meet quotas of racial concentration.\" <i>Chen v. City of Houston,</i> 206 F.3d 502, 511 (5th Cir.2000); <i>see also Easley v. Cromartie,</i> 532 U.S. 234, 241 &amp; 257, 121 S.Ct. 1452, 149 L.Ed.2d 430 (2001) (recognizing that race may not be the predominant factor in legislative districting, and noting that an email referencing \"racial balance\" constituted evidence of such an \"improper[]\" use of race). But surely redistricting involves no \"competition\" or \"consideration of merit,\" and of course \"no stigma results from any particular [districting] assignment.\" <i>Cf. post</i> at 1000. At bottom, the problem with the imposition of a racial quota and the use of inflexibly mechanical racial preferences is not simply that they impermissibly conflate skin color with merit or qualification; it is that, more than any euphemistic \"thumb on the scale,\" they breed deep-seated cross-racial resentment and do violence to the constitutional principle that \"we are just one race here. It is American.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 239, 115 S.Ct. 2097 (Scalia, J., concurring).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more baffling is the dissent's claim that because the District ultimately assigns each student to a \"quality\" high school offering a \"baseline ... education,\" no applicant rejected on the basis of his or her race \"suffers a constitutionally significant burden\" from the tiebreaker's operation. <i>Post</i> at 1000-1001, 1012-1013.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We certainly agree with the dissent's observation that no student has a right to attend the school of his or her choice or to attend a school offering anything more than the standard education mandated by state law. <i>Post</i> at 1012-1013. What the dissent seems to overlook is that individuals likewise have no right to welfare benefits, <i>Shapiro v. Thompson,</i> 394 U.S. 618, 627 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969), unemployment compensation, <i>Sherbert v. Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), <i>overruled on other grounds by Employment Div. v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), a tax exemption, <i>Sherbert,</i> 374 U.S. at 406, 83 S.Ct. 1790 (discussing <i>Speiser v. Randall,</i> 357 U.S. 513, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)), or a public job, <i>Perry v. Sindermann,</i> 408 U.S. 593, 597-98, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). Yet no one would seriously maintain that, as a result, states or localities could condition the distribution and extent of such benefits on the basis of race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent's appeal to the rights/privileges distinction in this context is particularly ironic because it readily parallels arguments long ago repudiated in this context. Indeed, it quite unintentionally evokes the State of Missouri's argument that because it had no duty to supply legal education, and there was therefore no personal \"right\" to a legal education, no one could suffer a legally cognizable injury from the University of Missouri Law School's use of a racial classification in admissions. Yet as the Court explained in rejecting that claim, \"The question here is not of a duty of the State to supply legal training, or of the quality of the training which it does supply, but of its duty when it provides such training to furnish it to the residents of the State upon the basis of an equality of right.\" <i>Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada,</i> 305 U.S. 337, 349-50, 59 S.Ct. 232, 83 L.Ed. 208 (1938).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, we think the issue here is not whether students have a right to attend the school of their choice, or one of significantly above-average quality. It is whether having made available a choice-based system of public education the District may use race to circumscribe parental choices in the way it has. The dissent's suggestion that it may do so because all are \"<i>equally</i> subject\" to such discrimination, <i>post</i> at 1012 (emphasis in original), cannot be correct: Across-the-board wrongs do not, as the dissent reasons, make a right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the dissent's thin scrutiny of the District's racial tiebreaker strays far from constitutional norms &#8212; and it inadvertently threatens to entrench a permanent regime of racial discrimination. For if public education's most compelling mission really is to prepare children to interact with those who look different by balancing each school's racial profile, then the Constitution's promise of equal justice will remain unfulfilled for the inestimable number of future generations during which race inevitably will be perceptible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the School District's use of the racial tiebreaker violates the equal protection mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment, we REVERSE the decision of the District Court and REMAND with instructions to ENJOIN the School District from using the racial tiebreaker, as most recently constituted, in making future high school assignments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable Thomas M.

Between the 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years &#8212; while this litigation was pending &#8212; the school board expanded the band to +/15 percent, meaning that the tiebreaker would operate only if an oversubscribed school had fewer than 26 percent or more than 56 percent white students.

Addressing temporal limitations in<i>Grutter,</i> the Court explained that \"[i]n the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions <i>in</i> race-conscious admissions policies <i>and</i> periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.\" 539 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (emphases added). Yet, notwithstanding the conjunctive nature of its stated requirements and in spite of the fact that Michigan's policy did not <i>itself</i> contain a sunset provision, the Court held the policy to be adequately limited after unhesitatingly crediting the University's pledge \"that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula,\" <i>id.</i> (quotation omitted), and stating that \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\" <i>Id.</i> at 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325. Whether that vague assertion represented a \"holding that racial discrimination in higher education admissions will be illegal in 25 years,\" <i>id.</i> at 351, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Thomas, J., dissenting), or merely a \"hope, but not [a] firm [ ] forecast, that over the next generation's span, progress ... will make it safe to sunset affirmative action\" in accordance with the ever-powerful \"international understanding of the office of affirmative action,\" <i>id.</i> at 344 &amp; 346, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), we cannot say.

The Court's recent decisions regarding the consideration of race in selective admissions to institutions of higher learning do not control in the secondary-school context, but they provide several guiding principles. First, the Court in <i>Grutter v.

It is well established that school districts have no <i>obligation</i> to remedy de facto (as distinct from de jure) segregation. <i>Freeman v. Pitts,</i> 503 U.S. 467, 495, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992). Nevertheless, several courts have pointed out the irony of a conclusion that a measure that could be required to remedy segregation could not be adopted voluntarily to prevent segregation. <i>See, e.g., Comfort,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 384-85 (\"It would make no sense if [school] officials were obliged to take responsibility for addressing these adverse consequences [of segregated schools] but at the same time were constitutionally barred from taking voluntary action aimed at nipping some of these effects in the bud.\"); <i>Parents Involved in Cmty.

Support for this conclusion comes from statements in the Supreme Court's school desegregation cases, which repeatedly refer to the voluntary integration of schools as sound educational policy within the discretion of local school officials. <i>See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,</i> 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971) (stating that school authorities \"are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude ... that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole\"); <i>N.C.

J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 507, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (holding that \"outright racial balancing\" did not constitute a permissible reason to establish a quota for awarding construction contracts); <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. 1430 (holding that, in the absence of a constitutional violation, the district <i>court</i> had no power to <i>order</i>\"[r]acial balance ... for its own sake\"); and <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 329-30, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (stating that the law school's concept of \"critical mass\" was permissible only because it was not \"outright racial balancing,\" but rather was \"defined by reference to ... educational benefits\"). Those decisions establish that the government may not act in furtherance of racial balance without a compelling nonracial reason. Unless and until the Supreme Court says otherwise, however, I would heed its repeated statements that the voluntary integration of public schools, in response to specific conditions of de facto segregation and in furtherance of legitimate educational policies, can be a constitutionally permissible interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I would hold that the District has a compelling interest in structuring its assignment policies to prevent a return to the era in which Seattle's undisputedly segregated housing pattern was the exclusive determinant of school assignments to neighborhood schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Deference to administrators' expertise in education policy is warranted.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to signaling specifically its approval of voluntary measures to promote integrated schools, the Supreme Court repeatedly has shown deference to school officials at the intersection between constitutional protections and educational policy. <i>See generally</i> Wendy Parker, <i>Connecting the Dots:</i> Grutter, <i>School Desegregation, and Federalism,</i> 45 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 1691 (2004). Local control over public education has animated Supreme Court jurisprudence from the dawn to the apparent twilight of federal-court involvement in the desegregation of public schools. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 349 U.S. at 299, 75 S.Ct. 753 (directing local school officials, with court oversight, to devise remedies for segregation in the light of \"varied local school problems\"); <i>Milliken v.

Brinkman,</i> 433 U.S. 406, 410, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977)). In the context of a challenge to a school-funding system, the Court was motivated, in part, by concerns about the judiciary's lack of competency in the area of educational policy. <i>See San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 1, 42, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (stating, in its rational-basis review of a school-funding system, that \"this case ... involves the most persistent and difficult questions of educational policy, another area in which this Court's lack of specialized knowledge and experience counsels against premature interference with the informed judgments made at the state and local levels\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1\" id=\"fn18-1_ref\">18</a> Thus, although I agree that public secondary schools do not have \"a constitutional right to select their student body,\" maj. op. at 981-82,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-1\" id=\"fn19-1_ref\">19</a> they have been given considerable discretion to devise school assignment policies, even in the face of adjudicated constitutional violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court also has shown solicitude toward the educational objectives of public school administrators in balancing those educational objectives with students' First Amendment rights. <i>See, e.g., Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier,</i> 484 U.S. 260, 273, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988) (holding that educators may censor student speech in school-sponsored forums for valid educational reasons and noting that \"[t]his standard is consistent with our oft-expressed view that the education of the Nation's youth is primarily the responsibility of parents, teachers, and state and local school officials, and not of federal judges\"); <i>see also Comfort,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 374 &amp; n. 83 (citing Supreme Court cases involving the balancing of schools' curricular needs against students' rights under the First, Fourth, and Eighth Amendments, as well as the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). This deference recognizes not merely a school's need to preserve order so as to promote pure \"academic\" learning, as the majority suggests, maj. op. at 982, but also to teach students that certain kinds of discourse are \"wholly inconsistent with the `fundamental values' of public school education,\" <i>Bethel Sch.

For this reason, I would afford some deference to the District's judgment that integrated schools are essential to its educational mission and would extend to the District's identification of its core values a deference similar to that which the <i>Grutter</i> Court afforded the university. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325; <i>cf.

Second, the institutions involved in those cases seek the \"true diversity\" befitting their advanced academic orientations; as I have discussed, the diversity interest in the K-12 context involves different educational benefits and, like the District's related interest in ameliorating de facto segregation, is more appropriately achieved through an explicit consideration of racial diversity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Where competition for a limited government resource is absent, rules about how competition may be conducted are irrelevant.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Grutter,</i> the Supreme Court \"define[d] the contours of the narrow-tailoring inquiry with respect to race-conscious university admissions programs.\" <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325. In the context of university admissions, where applicants compete for a limited number of spaces in a class, the Court focused its inquiry on what role race may play in judging an applicant's qualifications. The Court's underlying concern is for fair competition &#8212; to prevent race from being used as an outright substitute for merit in the competition for access to a limited government resource, in part because of the stigma that may attach. <i>See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. 265, 298, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (Powell, J., concurring) (stating that \"preferential programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor having no relationship to individual worth\"); <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. 706 (\"Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility.\"); <i>see also Gratz,</i> 539 U.S. at 272-73, 123 S.Ct. 2411 (applying the narrow-tailoring inquiry to ensure that applicants of all races have the opportunity to prove their merit based on a broad range of criteria). In <i>Grutter,</i> the Court discussed two specific rules to ensure fair competition. 539 U.S. at 334, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The first prohibits \"quotas,\" which insulate applicants from certain groups from competition with applicants from other groups for some portion of the available slots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22-1\" id=\"fn22-1_ref\">22</a> <i>Id.</i> at 335, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The second rule prevents race from being used as a mechanical proxy for merit by requiring individualized consideration of the merit of each applicant, across a broad range of factors (of which race may be but one). <i>Id.</i> at 336-37, 123 S.Ct. 2325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of those requirements, which concern how universities are permitted to evaluate merit, is relevant in a situation where there is absolutely no competition or consideration of merit at issue. <i>All</i> high school students must and will be placed in a Seattle public school. The students' relative merit is irrelevant. There are no special qualifications for assignment to any school, so no stigma results from any particular school assignment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23-1\" id=\"fn23-1_ref\">23</a> The dangers of substituting racial preference for fair, merit- or worth-based competition are absent here. Justice Powell recognized this very fact in his landmark opinion in <i>Bakke,</i> which reasoned that the use of racial classifications to desegregate schools was fundamentally different from the selective admissions context because, in the school assignment context, \"white students [were not] deprived of an equal opportunity for education.\" <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. at 301 n. 39, 98 S.Ct. 2733.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Powell's comment suggests an even more fundamental reason why a careful, holistic, individualized consideration of an applicant's worth is not necessary here: No student is being excluded from the government resource at issue &#8212; a free public education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24-1\" id=\"fn24-1_ref\">24</a> In the assignment process, all students are accommodated with the same baseline high school education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25-1\" id=\"fn25-1_ref\">25</a> As I will discuss in more depth below, differences among the high schools may be relevant to our consideration of the \"burdens\" that the Plan imposes, but perceived or actual differences in academic quality do not transform the District's assignment process into a competition for access to a limited government resource. This is especially true where it is clear that every student can enroll in at least one of Seattle's oversubscribed, \"quality\" high schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Where \"true diversity\" is not the goal, consideration of a broad range of diversity factors is unnecessary.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another rationale for the Court's requirement of holistic review is that it provides a closer fit with a university's interest in viewpoint diversity. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 337, 123 S.Ct. 2325. The Court held that it was impermissible to presume that race would correlate with viewpoint, perspective, or background; rather, the university must <i>evaluate</i> each applicant's viewpoint, perspective, and background. <i>Id.</i> at 338-39, 123 S.Ct. 2325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The danger that race would be used to \"fill[ ] stereotyped `viewpoint' niches,\" <i>Comfort,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 379, is not present here. The diversity interest in K-12 education is much simpler: that children learn to interact with peers of different races. That interest requires that there <i>be</i> children of different races in the classroom. Rather than relying on stereotypes, intergroup contact has the opposite effect; it inhibits the formation of stereotypes by teaching children that \"all people are different no matter what their color or ethnic background.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, the District's focus on racial diversity is not a presumption that students of the same race will share common viewpoints; the presence of students of different races is meant to break down, rather than to further, racial stereotypes by giving students an opportunity to learn that race does not signal an individual's viewpoint, perspective, or background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the holistic review necessary to achieve \"true diversity\" is of even less relevance to the District's interest in preventing and ameliorating de facto racial segregation.

[T]he cases cited by the District Court in support of its decision that the use of race alone in the Program was not narrowly tailored only address the efficacy of employing strictly racial classifications to achieve \"true diversity.\" Those decisions are, therefore, inapplicable to the present situation where the Program's aim ... is precisely to ameliorate <i>racial</i> isolation in the participating districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Brewer,</i> 212 F.3d at 752-53 (citations omitted). In other words, when the District's compelling interest is in racial diversity, it makes little sense to ask it instead to evaluate a student's musical talent, athletic prowess, or eligibility for a free lunch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26-1\" id=\"fn26-1_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Viewed in its historical and factual context, the District's Plan satisfies an appropriate narrow-tailoring test.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except for rejecting the narrow-tailoring factors peculiar to situations of competition and \"true diversity,\" I have no disagreement with the majority's identification of the remaining narrow-tailoring factors. As I will discuss, I conclude that the Plan satisfies the narrow-tailoring test. But first, in order to facilitate an accurate narrow-tailoring inquiry, I believe it is necessary to supplement the majority's statement of facts by placing the District's adoption of the Plan in a broader factual context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The broader context of desegregation efforts and the Board's decision to adopt the Plan.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The increase in Seattle's minority population after World War II was concentrated first in the central, then in the southeast, area of the city.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27-1\" id=\"fn27-1_ref\">27</a> Because school assignments were made strictly on the basis of neighborhood, schools in the central and southeast areas reflected that population concentration. In 1962, the central area's Garfield High School reported 64 percent minority enrollment (it accommodated 75 percent of all black students), and six of the central area elementary schools had at least 75 percent minority enrollment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28-1\" id=\"fn28-1_ref\">28</a> Meanwhile, the eight high schools serving other major areas of the city remained more than 95 percent white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1960's, the District responded to this imbalance in various ways. It granted the central area principals' request for special financial assistance. It responded to racial tensions by experimenting with exchange programs, in which a handful of students switched high schools for several weeks. And in 1963, the District implemented a voluntary racial transfer program, through which a student could transfer to any school with available space, if the transfer would improve the racial balance at the receiving school. Although this program had some positive results, it did not reduce the racial imbalance significantly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970's, the District stepped up its efforts. It adopted a plan to desegregate central-area middle schools by requesting volunteers to transfer between minority- and majority-dominated neighborhood schools and ordering mandatory transfers when the numbers of volunteers were insufficient. The District also took steps to desegregate Garfield High School by changing its educational program, improving its facilities, and eliminating the \"special transfers\" that had allowed white students to leave the Garfield area. In addition, for the 1977-78 school year, the District instituted a magnet-school program to promote desegregation. According to the District's history: While it appeared evident that the addition of magnet programs would not in itself desegregate the Seattle schools, there was supportive evidence that voluntary strategies, magnet and non-magnet, could be significant components of a more comprehensive desegregation plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the 1977-78 school year, Franklin was 78 percent minority, Rainier Beach 58 percent, Cleveland 75 percent, and Garfield 64 percent. Other high schools ranged from 9 percent to 23 percent minority enrollment, with one school (Lincoln) at 37 percent. <i>See Seattle Sch. Dist.,</i> 458 U.S. at 461, 102 S.Ct. 3187 (noting that the racial imbalance in Seattle's schools had increased between the 1970-71 and 1977-78 school years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1977, the NAACP filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights, alleging that Seattle's School Board had acted to further racial segregation in the city's schools. Several other organizations, principally the ACLU, threatened to file an action in court if the District failed to adopt a mandatory desegregation plan. When the District agreed to develop a desegregation plan, the Office of Civil Rights concomitantly agreed to delay its investigation, and the ACLU agreed to delay filing a lawsuit. <i>See Seattle Sch. Dist.,</i> 458 U.S. at 460 n. 2, 102 S.Ct. 3187 (describing this threat of litigation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1977, the District and community representatives reviewed five model plans. Ultimately, the District incorporated elements of each model into its final desegregation plan, adopted in December 1977 and known as the \"Seattle Plan.\" The Seattle Plan divided the district into zones, within which majority-dominated elementary schools were paired with minority-dominated elementary schools to achieve racial balance. Mandatory high school assignments were linked to elementary-school assignments, although various voluntary transfer options were available. With the Seattle Plan,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seattle became the first major city to adopt a comprehensive desegregation program voluntarily without a court order.

Because of Seattle's housing patterns, the District's planners explained that \"it was impossible to fashion clusters in a geographically contiguous manner\"; some cluster schools were near the student's home, but others were in \"racially and culturally different neighborhoods.\" Although roughly 70 percent of students received their first choices, the Controlled Choice plan still resulted in mandatory busing for 16 percent of the District's students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1990's, District staff were directed to devise a new plan for <i>all</i> grade levels to simplify assignments, reduce costs, and increase community satisfaction, among other things; the guiding factors were to be choice, diversity, and predictability. Staff developed four basic options, including the then-existing Controlled Choice plan, a regional choice plan, a neighborhood assignment plan with provision for voluntary, integration-positive transfers, and an open choice plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Board members testified that they considered all the options, as they related to the District's educational goals &#8212; with special emphasis, at the secondary-school level, on the goals of choice and diversity. Neighborhood and regional plans were viewed as unduly limiting student choice, on which the District placed high value because it was seen to increase parental involvement in the schools and promote improvements in quality through a marketplace model. The District sought to maintain its commitment to integrated education by establishing diversity goals, but moving away from the rigid desegregation guidelines and mandatory assignments prevalent in the 1970's and 1980's. The Board adopted the current, open choice Plan for the 1998-99 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan now under review permits students to rank their choices among the District's 10 high schools. The District has sought to make each of the 10 schools unique, with programs that attempt to respond to the continually changing needs of students and their parents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30-1\" id=\"fn30-1_ref\">30</a> Only when oversubscription results from families' choices &#8212; as, of course, it has &#8212; does the District become involved in the assignment process. Assignments to oversubscribed schools proceed by way of a series of tiebreakers: first, students with a sibling attending the selected school are assigned; second, <i>if</i> but only if the school deviates from the District's proportion of white and minority students by more than a specified percentage,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31-1\" id=\"fn31-1_ref\">31</a> students who bring that school closer to the ratio are assigned; third, students are assigned in order of the distance from their homes to the school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32-1\" id=\"fn32-1_ref\">32</a> The first and third tiebreakers seek to further the District's goal of parental involvement, and the second is directed toward the District's diversity goal.

When the District moved from its Controlled Choice plan to the current, open choice Plan, it predicted that families would tend to choose schools close to their homes. Indeed, this feature was seen as a positive way to increase parental involvement. However, unfettered choice &#8212; especially with tiebreakers based on neighborhood or distance from a school &#8212; raised the risk that Seattle's high school enrollment would begin to reflect its segregated housing patterns. The District's 2000-01 enrollment data showed that, of the students living in the southern half of Seattle, only 23 percent are white (6,247 out of 27,377 students), as compared with 64 percent of the students living in the northern half of the city (12,571 out of 19,555 students).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is de facto residential segregation across this white/ nonwhite axis that the District has battled historically and that it sought to prevent by making the integration tiebreaker a part of its open choice Plan. Although I have no doubt that other forms of race-based tension exist, <i>see</i> maj. op. at 983-84 n. 47, the District reasonably placed its focus here. The District has consistently faced a pattern in which its white students live predominately in the northern half of the city (in 2000-2001, 66.8 percent of the District's white students lived in the northern half of the city) and its students of color &#8212; in <i>each</i> of the three largest categories that the District tracks<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34-1\" id=\"fn34-1_ref\">34</a> &#8212; live predominately in the southern half of the city. In 2000-2001, 74.2 percent of the District's Asian students, 83.6 percent of its Black students, and 65 percent of its Hispanic students lived in the southern half of the city:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <pre>       2000-01 ENROLLMENT BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n-----------------------------------------------------\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA    ASIAN   BLACK    HISPANIC   WHITE\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    NORTH          2,879   1,778     1,693     12,571\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    SOUTH          8,269   9,054     3,145      6,247\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    TOTAL         11,148   10,832    4,838     18,818\n-----------------------------------------------------\n PERCENTAGE OF\nSTUDENTS SOUTH     74.2%   83.6%     65.0%      33.2%\n-----------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p>Moreover, Seattle's peculiar geography makes its northern neighborhoods and schools distant from its southern neighborhoods and schools. In these circumstances, the District permissibly could prioritize white/nonwhite, primarily north/ south, movement. This white/nonwhite focus also is consistent with the history of public school integration measures in this country, as reflected in a current federal regulation defining \"[m]inority group isolation\" as \"a condition in which minority group children constitute more than 50 percent of the enrollment of the school,\" without distinguishing among the various categories included within the definition of \"[m]inority group.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 280.4(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To discourage choices that would perpetuate this north-south division between the district's white and nonwhite populations, the District gave priority to choices that would counter it and create north-south movement within the District. In the 2000-01 school year, the integration tiebreaker operated in four high schools (that is, four high schools were oversubscribed and deviated by more than 15 percent from the ratio of white to nonwhite students District-wide). Although the integration tiebreaker was a limited measure, in contrast to the District's previous efforts, it did serve to alter the imbalance in the schools in which it operated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's contrary view is based on a skewed presentation of the enrollment statistics. Figures reflecting the tiebreaker's total effect on a school's enrollment, such as those cited in the majority opinion, <i>see</i> maj. op. at 984 (\"Table 2\"), 985 (\"Table 3\"), 985 (citing a maximum shift of 6.1 percent in the white/nonwhite ratio), artificially minimize the tiebreaker's effect by failing to recognize that students enter the ninth grade in much greater numbers than they transfer to other schools after the ninth grade. The following statistics submitted by the District, which portray directly the effect of the tiebreaker on the make-up of the ninth grade classes at the four affected schools, illustrate the function of the tiebreaker far more accurately:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <pre>2000-01 CHANGE IN PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS OF COLOR IN\n                 NINTH GRADE CLASSES\n------------------------------------------------------\n                WITHOUT         WITH\n              INTEGRATION   INTEGRATION   PERCENT\n  SCHOOL      TIEBREAKER    TIEBREAKER    CHANGE\n------------------------------------------------------\n FRANKLIN        79.2          59.5       - 19.7\n------------------------------------------------------\nNATHAN HALE      30.5          40.6       + 10.1\n------------------------------------------------------\n  BALLARD        33.0          54.2       + 21.2\n------------------------------------------------------\n ROOSEVELT       41.1          55.3       + 14.2\n------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the majority's references to a 6.1 percent maximum shift do not tell the whole story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, without the integration tiebreaker, the freshman classes at some of the affected north-end schools may well have been sufficiently diverse to promote interaction across the white/nonwhite axis and to prevent the tokenization of nonwhite students. <i>See</i> maj. op. at 984 n. 49. However, without the integration tiebreaker, the Plan would have operated to prevent students of color who lived in the south end of Seattle from attending those schools because of the schools' distance from south-end neighborhoods. The tiebreaker furthered the District's goal of giving south-end students of color the opportunity to opt out of attending the more racially concentrated schools in their neighborhoods, if they so desired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the integration tiebreaker does not attempt to achieve perfect adherence to the District-wide ratios in each of the District's high schools. Except by encouraging an optout, the tiebreaker does not directly alter the racial make-up of schools that are not oversubscribed, even that of the south-end schools that diverge widely from District-wide proportions. <i>See supra</i> note 13. I do not, however, view the Plan's underinclusiveness as a fatal flaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, I find it peculiar that the majority's rebuttal makes so much of the failure of the District's Plan to achieve perfect racial balance. To be sure, in strict scrutiny review, especially in the First Amendment context, a law's underinclusiveness can be a sign that the enacting authority was not in fact motivated by its stated objectives. <i>See Republican Party of Minn. v. White,</i> 536 U.S. 765, 780, 122 S.Ct. 2528, 153 L.Ed.2d 694 (2002) (noting that underinclusiveness impairs the credibility of the government's rationale for restricting speech) (citing <i>City of Ladue v. Gilleo,</i> 512 U.S. 43, 52-53, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 129 L.Ed.2d 36 (1994)). Apparently, in order for the majority to find that a race-conscious means is necessary to achieve the District's stated goals, the means would have to produce perfect adherence to the District's racial make-up &#8212; which, in Seattle's circumstances, only aggressive districting, forced busing, and more intrusive racial classifications could do. However, requiring that the chosen means achieve perfect balance would make strict scrutiny impossible to satisfy, because the burden caused by the Plan &#8212; the third element of the narrow-tailoring inquiry &#8212; would be enormous. That is why, in contexts more relevant to this case, such as employment, courts have found that the modesty &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> the underinclusiveness &#8212; of government action is a point <i>in favor</i> of a conclusion that the action was narrowly tailored. <i>See, e.g., Cotter v. City of Boston,</i> 323 F.3d 160, 171 (1st Cir.) (\"The necessity for relief was great, but the means chosen by the Department were modest &#8212; only three African-American officers were promoted out of rank &#8212; indicating narrow tailoring.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 179, 157 L.Ed.2d 47 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because strict scrutiny is not meant to be \"fatal in fact,\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 326, 123 S.Ct. 2325, I would hold that the District's modest measures, which were enacted to decrease the intrusiveness and burden of its assignment policy, do not cause its Plan to become unnecessary or the District's motivations to become suspect. And, the Plan furthers the District's goals better than any workable race-neutral alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">(ii) <i>Race-neutral alternatives</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Grutter,</i> the Court explained that narrow tailoring \"require[s] serious, good faith consideration of <i>workable</i> race-neutral alternatives <i>that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.</i>\" 539 U.S. at 339, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (emphasis added).

By affording deference to the university's identification of its core educational values in this context, the Court simply recognized that whether a race-neutral measure is truly an alternative in the first place depends on whether that measure is consistent with an institution's core values.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority faults the District for failing to consider seriously three specific race-neutral measures. Maj. op. at 970-975. One of the majority's suggestions &#8212; that the District measure and assign students according to their \"true diversity,\" maj. op. at 971-72 &#8212; cannot properly be considered an \"alternative,\" because it is not directed toward achieving the District's interest in a racially integrated learning environment. <i>See supra</i> pp. 1001. Furthermore, it is clear from the record that the school board <i>has</i> discussed the use of other diversity measures, including poverty, as a tiebreaker. Although the majority correctly points out that there has been no formal study of that proposal by District staff, Board members' testimony reveals two legitimate reasons why the majority of the Board rejected the use of poverty measures to reach its goal of racial diversity: one, it is insulting to minorities and often inaccurate to assume that the two populations are coextensive; and, two, implementation would be thwarted by high school students' reluctance to reveal their socioeconomic status to their peers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also asserts that the District should have considered more formally a proposal developed by the Urban League (which, incidentally, did not eliminate the integration tiebreaker, but merely demoted it). Maj. op. at 973-75. The majority quotes at length from the colorful and often emotional testimony of one Board member, who clearly was not impressed by the proposal. But there was other testimony from other Board members suggesting that the Board was aware of, and informally considered, the Urban League's proposal. Board member Schaad-Lamphere testified that she remembers reading the Urban League's plan and considered it to be similar to other regional assignment plans being proposed at the same time; she testified that she weighed it as she did other community input. Furthermore, the testimony of Board member Nielsen is consistent with Superintendent Olchefske's understanding that regional plans, including the Urban League's, had been disfavored by the Board because of the high value the District placed on choice among the different academic offerings at the various high schools. In other words, when all the testimony in the record is examined, it is clear that the Urban League's plan was in fact considered and that it was rejected for legitimate educational reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36-1\" id=\"fn36-1_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority concludes that such informal consideration is inadequate and that we should evaluate the District's consideration of race-neutral alternatives using the same rigorous evidentiary standard that we use to evaluate whether a local government has proved that past discrimination justified its enactment of a remedial minority set-aside program. Maj. op. at 972 (citing cases that elucidate the latter standard). To the contrary, our cases on set-aside programs plainly employ different standards to these different analyses &#8212; with a more permissive view toward the analysis of race-neutral alternatives. <i>Compare Coral Constr. Co. v. King County,</i> 941 F.2d 910, 916-22 (9th Cir.1991) (discussing, within its \"compelling government interest\" analysis, the high burden of demonstrating actual discrimination by the county), <i>with id.</i> at 923 (noting, under the race-neutral alternatives prong of the narrow-tailoring analysis, that \"some degree of practicality is subsumed in the exhaustion requirement\" and that exhaustion of every possible alternative is <i>not</i> required); <i>see also Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coalition for Econ. Equity,</i> 950 F.2d 1401, 1416-17 (9th Cir.1991) (citing <i>Coral</i>).

Maj. op. at 970 (emphasis omitted). In view of the District's clear commitment to educational choice among high schools, and in view of its desire to provide students with an opportunity to attend school closer to home, the majority's suggestion flatly contradicts the <i>Grutter</i> Court's approach to narrow tailoring:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as \"using a lottery system\"....

The university, in other words, was not required to \"earnestly appraise[ ],\" maj. op. at 970 (emphasis omitted), a lottery system. The majority is incorrect in its conclusion that the District must do so, despite the harm that a lottery would do to the goals of choice and parental involvement that lie at the heart of its educational mission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37-1\" id=\"fn37-1_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a closer question whether the District's goals could be met by using a pure lottery <i>tiebreaker</i> &#8212; that is, a lottery to determine which of the students who had <i>chosen</i> a particular school would be enrolled there. This format would allow the District to retain its emphasis on choice and would cause unhappiness more randomly. However, as Superintendent Olchefske explained, District patterns suggested that more people would choose schools close to home, thus raising the justifiable concern that the pool of students choosing a particular school would be skewed in favor of the demographic of the surrounding residential area. Indeed, when the District adopted the Plan, it could not predict exactly how much harm open choice would do to the racial diversity of its schools. A lottery, in the face of this uncertainty, would have left the District without a safety net for its diversity goals and, moreover, would have prevented the District from furthering the policy goals reflected in its sibling and proximity tiebreakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the long history of its efforts to achieve integrated schools, the District has experimented with many alternatives, including magnet and other special-interest programs, which it continues to employ, and race-conscious districting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38-1\" id=\"fn38-1_ref\">38</a> But when a racially integrated school system is the goal (or racial isolation is the problem), there is no more effective means than a consideration of race to achieve a solution. Even Plaintiff's expert conceded that, \"if you don't consider race, it may not be possible to offer an integrated option to students.... [I]f you want to guarantee it you have to consider race.\" As Superintendent Olchefske stated, \"when diversity, meaning racial diversity, is part of the educational environment we wanted to create, I think our view was you took that issue head on and used &#8212; you used race as part of the structures you developed.\" The logic of this point is sound: When race is a principal element of the government's compelling interest, then race-neutral alternatives seldom will be equally efficient. <i>Cf. Hunter v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.,</i> 190 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir.1999) (upholding, as narrowly tailored, a research elementary school's admissions policy that explicitly considered race in pursuit of a racially balanced research sample).

Specifically, Plaintiff suggests that, even when they are considered \"out of balance\" by the District (i.e., when they deviate from the 60/40 ratio by more than 15 percent and thus enroll less than 45 percent or more than 75 percent nonwhite students), Seattle's oversubscribed schools are sufficiently racially diverse to achieve the District's goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree that the District's means significantly overshoot its goals. First, the District is trying to teach its students to be effective participants in the racially diverse environment in which they exist. Superintendent Olchefske noted that Seattle's school-age demographic is significantly more racially diverse than the demographic for its population as a whole. (\"There [are] a lot of elderly white people in this town,\" he noted.) And he stated that the District has no regular access to data on the racial make-up of Seattle's private school students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the racial mix at <i>some</i> of the oversubscribed high schools would be sufficiently diverse for the District to achieve its goals<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39-1\" id=\"fn39-1_ref\">39</a> in those schools without the integration tiebreaker, this fact would not account for the effect of the integration tiebreaker on the overall school system. A clear objective of the School Board was that \"no child should be required to attend a racially concentrated school.\" Removing the integration tiebreaker would mean that non-white students living in the southern area of the city, where neighborhoods and schools are more racially concentrated, would not have an opportunity for access to the more diverse schools in the northern part of the city, simply because of where they live. Giving them this access furthers the District's diversity goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the fact that a particular oversubscribed high school would draw a sufficiently diverse population in a given year without the integration tiebreaker does not guarantee that it would continue to do so. As I discussed above, open choice puts school assignment in the hands of the students; a tiebreaker tied to the District's racial demographic is a natural way for the District to retain a safety net.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Flexibility</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District also has shown that its Plan is flexible in the short term and that its approach has been flexible over the long term. The District no longer forces white students south, nor nonwhite students north. For this reason, racial concentration has increased in some schools. But the District's response has been measured. Responsive to community concerns and its own educational goals, the District has abandoned its complicated and mandatory systems for integrating its schools. Instead, it has developed a system that gives south-end non-white students an opportunity to leave racially concentrated schools (if they wish to) and promotes integrated schools across the district, while preserving the choice that it considers so critical to parental involvement. Mandatory assignments are kept to a minimum,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40-1\" id=\"fn40-1_ref\">40</a> and waivers are permitted for various reasons. The District's consistent movement from coercive to voluntary integration measures lends credence to its argument that it is working, through improvements to its programs, to reduce or eliminate oversubscription and therefore to reduce its reliance on the integration tiebreaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Plan is not inflexible in the manner of a quota; the integration tiebreaker operates only when <i>patterns of individual choice</i> result in oversubscription, and only until the school approximates the characteristics of the district as a whole. Choice, not a prescribed ratio of white to nonwhite students, controls the overwhelming majority of assignments. And choice patterns have been shown to change over time, as new facilities and programs are offered at different schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District has demonstrated its ability to be responsive to these choice patterns and to the concerns of its constituents. It revisits the plan annually.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41-1\" id=\"fn41-1_ref\">41</a> In 2000, when a higher than normal number of students selected the same schools, the Board responded by increasing the integration trigger from a 10 percent to a 15 percent deviation from the school population and adopting a \"thermostat\" that turns off the integration tiebreaker as soon as the school has come into balance. The majority considers it constitutionally significant that the Board rejected a staff suggestion that the trigger instead be increased to 20 percent. Board members testified that they rejected a 20 percent trigger, in effect, because it would fail to assist students in moving from racially concentrated south-end schools. In other words, the proposed 20 percent trigger would no longer promote the Board's goals; it therefore could not be considered narrowly tailored to achieve the District's compelling interest because it would not achieve that interest at all. The Board's decision thus is not a sign that the Board has failed, as the majority suggests, to \"minimize [the] adverse impact on third parties,\" maj. op. at 975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Relative burden on third parties.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority assumes that every student who is denied his or her choice of schools because of the integration tiebreaker suffers a constitutionally significant burden. As I foreshadowed above, however, I consider the District's Plan to impose a minimal burden that is shared equally by all of the District's students. <i>See Parents Involved,</i> 72 P.3d at 159-60 (noting that the burden of not being allowed to attend one's preferred school is shared by all students equally).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we view the Plan on the large scale, without attempting to anticipate students' subjective and shifting preferences for different schools, all the District's students are <i>equally</i> subject to the possible burden of being denied their first choices. Only when we conceive of the Plan narrowly, by imagining two students &#8212; one white, one nonwhite &#8212; who are next door neighbors and have identical preferences for Ballard or for Franklin high school, will one student bear a \"burden\" and the other gain a \"benefit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet it is well established that \"there [is] no right under Washington law to attend a local school or the school of the student's choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42-1\" id=\"fn42-1_ref\">42</a> Of course, students and their parents will nonetheless prefer some schools over others; their preferences may be based on their perceptions of a school's academic quality, on their subjective preference for a particular educational theme or program, or on the convenience of attending a particular school, among other things. These preferences result in changing choice patterns and the oversubscription of certain high schools. But oversubscribed schools do not become a limited government resource because of their popularity in a given year or their convenience for a given family. <i>See Hampton,</i> 102 F.Supp.2d at 380 n. 43 (\"The Court understands that students and their parents might prefer one school over another. The preference may even arise from a perception that one school is better than others due to its location, its teachers and principal, or its classroom environment. However, these matters of personal preference do not distinguish those schools in a constitutionally significant sense.\"); <i>see also supra</i> note 24. Despite any differences in academic quality (or perceptions thereof), all students who enroll in a Seattle high school will receive a high school education that meets state standards. And, as the District points out, even if Plaintiff's assertions of objectively unequal school quality were accepted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43-1\" id=\"fn43-1_ref\">43</a> it is undisputed that the integration tiebreaker operates to give every student an opportunity to attend at least one of five oversubscribed \"quality\" high schools (because at least one is \"integration positive\" for both white and nonwhite students). I do not believe that students' subjective preferences for one school over another, where the existence and educational relevance of objective differences among them is disputed, make the inconvenience of a nonpreferred assignment weightier than the District's legitimate educational goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the District has minimized any burden by working to ameliorate the inconvenience and frustration for families who do not receive their preferred school assignments. When the popularity of the District's five oversubscribed schools spiked for 2000-01 assignments, the School Board met to consider ways to soften the adverse effects. The administration immediately began to \"aggressively move the waitlists\" and to attempt to increase capacity at the oversubscribed schools. The Board and the administration discussed specific, long-range plans to increase the attractiveness of the undersubscribed schools. Finally, the District reached out to students receiving assignments to undersubscribed schools to share with them advantages of the schools of which they may not have been aware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. <i>Conclusion.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all these reasons, the Plan adopted by the Seattle School District for high school assignments is constitutional notwithstanding its inclusion of an integration tiebreaker.

I disagree with the majority's reasoning that the District's plan is \"necessarily selective\" merely because some schools are oversubscribed or more popular. <i>See</i> maj. op. at 979-80.

Quotas, as I understand them, are not at issue here because no student is preferentially admitted to, or turned away from, the Seattle public high schools. Thus, the District does not run afoul of this aspect of the Court's narrow-tailoring analysis.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The majority seizes upon the more general sense of the word \"quota\" &#8212; as meaning \"proportion\" &#8212; and argues that \"racial balancing\" is per se unconstitutional. <i>See</i> maj. op. at 986-87. The cited cases do not support the majority's sweeping statements. First, the Court in <i>Croson</i> held that a minority set aside was prohibited because the government could not prove that past discrimination provided a compelling reason for the program, not because \"racial balancing\" as a mechanism for achieving a compelling state interest would necessarily be inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, states are prohibited from making race the <i>predominant</i> factor in drawing legislative districts because of the impermissibility of racial stereotyping (that is, using race as a proxy for political characteristics), not because any consideration of a district's racial proportions is per se improper. <i>See Bush v. Vera,</i> 517 U.S. 952, 968, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 135 L.Ed.2d 248 (1996) (plurality); <i>see also id.</i> at 958, 116 S.Ct. 1941 (noting that redistricting may be performed with \"consciousness of race\"). These cases do not establish that the District is per se prohibited from linking its assignment practices to the racial make-up of its student enrollment, especially where student choices, not fixed proportions, are the principal determinant of student assignments. I simply cannot agree that we have reached the majority's promised land: Our governments, schools, and courts may yet be forced, by compelling reasons, to acknowledge that race exists in America. <i>See Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 333, 123 S.Ct. 2325 (noting that, in our society, \"race unfortunately still matters\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23-1_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Students are selected by merit into at least one District<i>program</i> (which carries a corresponding school assignment), but not into any District <i>school.</i> Those who test in the top 2 percent of their grade levels are offered admission to the Advanced Placement Program for academically talented students.

Indeed, the District could devise a permissible assignment system that is devoid of student choice among high schools.

We draw the following restatement of facts largely from <i>Parents Involved II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Seattle School District Number 1 (the \"School District\") operates ten public high schools: Ballard, Chief Sealth, Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield, Ingraham, Nathan Hale, Rainier Beach, Roosevelt, and West Seattle. Four of these (Ballard, Ingraham, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt) are located north of downtown Seattle; of the remaining six, five (Chief Sealth, Cleveland, Franklin, Garfield, and Rainier Beach) are located south of downtown, and one (West Seattle) is located directly west of downtown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These schools vary widely in quality, as measured by such factors as standardized test scores,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> numbers of college preparatory and Advanced Placement (AP) courses offered and the availability of an Internal Baccalaureate (IB) program, percentages of students taking AP courses and SATs, percentages of graduates who attend college, <i>Seattle Times</i> college-preparedness rankings, University of Washington rankings, and disciplinary statistics. Moreover, some of the schools offer unique educational programs or opportunities not offered in other schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The School District has never been segregated by law. However, due to Seattle's racially imbalanced housing patterns,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> if Seattle's children were simply assigned to the high schools nearest their homes, those schools would tend to reflect such imbalance. That is, the demographic profile of the individual high schools would not mirror the demographic makeup of the city's student population as a whole.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> As part of its continuing efforts to prevent such imbalance and to promote racial diversity in its high schools, the School District has adopted an open choice plan instead of simply assigning students to the high schools nearest their homes. Pursuant to this system, each student may choose to attend any of the ten high schools in the city, so long as there is room available in that school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District's open choice plan provides for a multi-step application process. Each student is first asked to rank the high schools he or she would like to attend. If a student is not admitted to his or her first-choice school because that school is full, the School District attempts to assign him or her to his or her second-choice school, and so on. If a student is not admitted to any of his or her chosen schools, he or she receives a mandatory assignment to a school with available space.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, a significant problem arises when a school becomes \"oversubscribed\" &#8212; that is, when more students want to attend that school than there are spaces available. For the academic year 2000-01, five of the School District's high schools were oversubscribed and five were undersubscribed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The magnitude of oversubscription during the 2000-01 school year underscores its problematic nature: Approximately 82 percent of students selected one of the oversubscribed high schools as their first choice, while only about 18 percent picked one of the undersubscribed high schools as their first choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve the dilemma of oversubscription, the School District's high school assignment plan uses a series of four \"tiebreakers\" to determine which students will be admitted to each oversubscribed school. The first tiebreaker gives a preference to students with siblings already attending the requested school. This tiebreaker accounts for somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of high school assignments. If a school is still oversubscribed after applying this first tiebreaker, the School District proceeds to a second tiebreaker, which is based entirely on race. For purposes of the racial tiebreaker, students are deemed to be of the race specified in their registration forms, which ask parents to identify their child's race. Because registration must be completed in person by a parent, if a parent declines to specify a racial category, the School District assigns the student a category based on a visual inspection of the parent (and, if present, the student) at the time of registration. It is this second &#8212; racial &#8212; tiebreaker that spawned the present suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Use of the racial tiebreaker is designed to balance the racial makeup of the city's public high schools. Accordingly, if an oversubscribed school's demographic profile deviates from the overall demography of Seattle's student population (approximately 40 percent white and 60 percent non-white) by more than a set number of percentage points, the School District designates that school \"integration positive.\" The racial tiebreaker is then applied in the course of determining admissions to such schools, so that students whose race (coded by the School District simply as white or non-white) will push an integration positive school closer to the desired racial ratio are automatically admitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, at Franklin (for instance), whites are admitted preferentially because they <i>are</i> white; and at Ballard, non-whites are admitted preferentially because they <i>are not</i> white.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Ultimately, the School District's use of this racial tiebreaker determines where about 10 percent of applicants will be admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once all students of the preferred racial category are admitted to an oversubscribed high school, any remaining \"ties\" are broken by resort to a third variable: distance. Quite simply, applicants are admitted on the basis of the mileage between their homes and the school to which they seek admission, with those who live closest admitted first. Although a fourth tiebreaker exists &#8212; a random lottery &#8212; it rarely is invoked because distances are calculated to one hundredth of a mile for purposes of the preceding tiebreaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parents Involved in Community Schools (\"Parents\") is \"a nonprofit corporation formed by parents whose children have been or may be denied admission to the high schools of their choosing solely because of race.\" It commenced this legal action in July of 2000, contending that the School District's use of the racial tiebreaker for high school admissions is illegal under both state and federal law. Specifically, Parents alleged that by using race to decide who will be admitted to the oversubscribed high schools, the School District engages in illegal racial discrimination prohibited by the Washington Civil Rights Act (\"Initiative 200\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Parents and the School District moved for summary judgment on all claims; neither contended that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment. In a published opinion dated April 6, 2001, the district court upheld the use of the racial tiebreaker under both state and federal law, granting the School District's motion and denying the Parents's. <i>See Parents Involved I, 137 F.Supp.2d at 1240.</i> Parents timely filed an appeal in this court and, on April 16, 2002, we issued an opinion reversing the district court's decision.

A significant focus of the decisionmakers is on an applicant's academic ability, as measured by his or her undergraduate grade point average and score on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT).

Instead, admissions officials must look beyond those measures to \"soft\" variables, including \"the enthusiasm of the [applicant's] recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant's essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection,\" which in turn are used to help measure \"an applicant's likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the institution.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This focus on \"soft\" variables aims to ensure that the Law School can \"`achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone's education and thus make a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting the Law School's written admissions policy).

Though perhaps not palatable to the electorate &#8212; a consideration that cannot justify the use of race in its stead &#8212; a randomized lottery would necessarily produce levels of school diversity statistically comparable to (and perhaps even more proportional than) the District's racial tiebreaker. Yet, when asked about using a lottery to meet the District's diversity targets, Board member Barbara Schaad-Lamphere actually argued that a lottery would <i>not</i> result in racially proportional representation \"because of probabilities, the law of probabilities.\" Let us be clear: We are not forcing the School District to <i>adopt</i> a random assignment lottery. But given its evident commitment to achieving diversity, there is no question but that the Board should have <i>earnestly appraised</i> such a program's costs and benefits. Whatever reasons there may be to reject a lottery, the demonstrably false pretext that \"the law of probabilities\" would render it ineffectual is not one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent takes us to task for suggesting that the School District must seriously consider using a lottery to achieve its diversity goals when <i>Grutter</i> itself explicitly rejected the plaintiffs' claim that Michigan's Law School should have considered a lottery. <i>See post</i> at 1009-1010. We find such criticism unavailing. <i>Grutter</i> rejected the plaintiffs' demand that the Law School consider a lottery because such a program would necessarily diminish the quality of its admitted students and might not produce adequate educational diversity due to potential under-representation of various (not necessarily racial) kinds of diversity in its limited applicant pool.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Yet as the dissent <i>itself</i> notes, the School District's adoption of a lottery is subject to neither of these potential pitfalls. <i>Post</i> at 1000 (noting that in this case \"there is absolutely no competition or consideration of merit.... <i>All</i> high school students must and will be placed in a Seattle public school. The students' relative merit is irrelevant.\") (emphasis in original). As a result, the District's unconstrained applicant pool is not subject to a possible demographic skew, and there is absolutely no possibility that a lottery would diminish the quality of admitted students. Thus, neither of <i>Grutter's</i> grounds for rejecting consideration of a lottery is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ii</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the School District could have considered adopting a diversity-oriented policy that does not rely exclusively on race, but which instead accounts for the wider array of characteristics that comprise the kind of true diversity lauded by Justice Powell in <i>Bakke</i> and by the Court in <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz.</i> In this respect, we observe that &#8212; for purposes of its internal school funding formula &#8212; the School District already collects a much wider array of data on students and families than merely their racial and ethnic identities. Among that data is information on whether a child lives at home or in \"an agency\"; if she lives at home, with whom; whether the child's home and most proficient languages are English or some other language; and the child's eligibility for free or reduced price lunch. Yet, the District considers none of those factors in admissions, and although individual Board members have occasionally suggested using one or more of those factors as an alternative tiebreaker, the Board has declined even to study how such an alternative would impact school diversity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent once again strays in its criticism of this suggestion. It first suggests that a programmatic focus on \"true diversity\" is no alternative at all \"because it is not directed toward achieving the District's interest in a racially integrated learning environment.\" <i>Post</i> at 1008. But this claim is fundamentally mistaken. A programmatic focus on true diversity &#8212; within which race is one of many factors considered by the School District &#8212; <i>subsumes</i> the District's interest in achieving racial diversity: It does not <i>supplant</i> it. Indeed, such a focus may not only help the District achieve the racial diversity it desires, <i>see infra</i> at 1001 n. 26, but might actually serve the District's socialization interests to a far greater degree than its presently narrow focus on race alone. For, if the District's fundamental interest is, as the dissent characterizes it, \"to prepare children to be good citizens &#8212; to socialize children and to inculcate civic values,\" <i>see post</i> at 992, and to achieve \"a more democratic and inclusive experience for all citizens,\" <i>id.</i> at 991-92 n. 9 (quoting one of the District's expert witnesses), then accounting for factors other than race &#8212; like socioeconomic status &#8212; would bolster the District's \"democratic\" mission by fostering, for instance, cross-class (and not just cross-racial) interaction. <i>See</i> Richard D. Kahlenberg, <i>All Together Now: Creating Middle-Class Schools Through Public School Choice (2001)</i> (documenting the civic and educational benefits of socioeconomically integrated schooling).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also errs in suggesting that \"even though there has been no formal study of [this] proposal,\" the deposition testimony of a few Board members is sufficient to demonstrate \"legitimate reasons why the majority of the Board rejected the use of poverty measures....\" <i>Post</i> at 1008. We disagree. The Board members' blithe dismissal of a sincerely presented proposal simply cannot satisfy the constitutional requirement that the government earnestly appraise race-minimal alternatives prior to adopting race-conscious policies. Matters not formally evaluated cannot be \"rejected\" in a constitutionally-relevant sense: Such appraisal &#8212; whether with regard to the need for race-based action, or to the shape such action is to take &#8212; must be conducted \"on the record.\" <i>See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-511, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In September 2000, they developed &#8212; and then formally proposed to the School Board &#8212; a comprehensive plan that would seek to enhance the quality of education in the City's schools by focusing on educational organization, teacher quality, parent-teacher interaction, raising curricular standards, substantially broadening the availability of specialized and magnet programs (which could attract a broader cross-section of students to undersubscribed schools), and supporting extra-curricular development.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, their plan proposed decreasing the School District's reliance on race in the admissions process by adding a new, primary tiebreaker based on pairing neighborhoods with particular schools and structuring the scope and size of the component residential areas such that no single region would contain enough students to fill its linked high school to capacity. Under the plan, preferences initially would be given to students choosing a school in their paired region, and the existing racial tiebreaker would be dropped from second to third in the process of resolving any remaining oversubscription (and any residual racial concentration not already solved by improving the attractiveness of previously racially concentrated schools). Finally, the Urban League working group proposed that the School District add an eleventh public high school, and that it strenuously market to the public the existing (and proposed additional) specialty programs throughout the City's other high schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot know whether its proposed reforms would have been successful in achieving the working group's ambitious goals, but there is no doubt that the Urban League presented the Board with an especially thoughtful proposal for addressing the dilemmas plaguing contemporary urban education<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> while simultaneously striving to attain educational diversity without unduly relying on the use of crude racial preferences.

While it may be the case that educational institutions need not <i>exhaust</i> every conceivable alternative to the use of racial classifications to satisfy strict scrutiny, narrow tailoring at least demands that schools <i>earnestly consider</i> using race-neutral and race-limited alternatives in order to provide for the kind of diversity that, properly constituted, can further compelling educational and social interests. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U.S. at 339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Given the tragic history of race in our country, the Constitution demands no less &#8212; our education policymakers' enthusiasm for handheld electronically simulated \"bass lunker fishing game[s]\" notwithstanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>d</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, the School District's racial tiebreaker is not designed to minimize its adverse impact on third parties; the extent to which it uses race is not calibrated to the benefits sought. Over time, \"the band,\" <i>see supra</i> n. 6, has ranged from as much as +/25 percent to as little as +/10 percent, and it currently sits at +/15 percent. And while such variances conceivably could be interpreted to suggest that the School District is carefully trying to optimize its realization of diversity's benefits, the record belies such an interpretation. In October 2000, School Superintendent Joseph Olchefske formally recommended that the band be expanded from +/10 percent to +/20 percent because \"[a]fter review and 2 years experience, there was not strong evidence that utilizing a +/10 [percent] band provided a materially better educational experience than would a band of +/20 [percent]. Accordingly, in order to fulfill our narrow tailoring obligation, staff is recommending a +/20 [percent] band.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Yet, even after its chief educator and his staff twice had reported that twice as much of an adjustment would have no adverse impact on the diversity payoff, the Board adjusted the band by just 5 percentage points. This is not the measure of tailored proportionality. Instead, it represents a stubborn adherence to the use of race for race's sake, with the effect that some non-preferred student applicants will be displaced solely because of their racial and ethnic identities &#8212; to no benefit at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken alone, any of these shortcomings would doom the School District's program. Together, they reveal an unadulterated pursuit of racial proportionality that cannot possibly be squared with the demands of the Equal Protection Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>5</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to evade the clear import of the narrow tailoring analysis applied by <i>Grutter, Gratz</i>, and their progenitors, the School District argues that such analysis simply does not apply in the K-12 context: \"[T]he Michigan decisions have meaning only in the context of selective admissions and other `zero sum' programs.... [The] argument that race may be considered [only] in a holistic individualized review as one factor among many contributing to diversity is not applicable to non-selective school assignments.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Indeed, they argue, the use of racial classifications in their allegedly \"non-zero sum\" open choice high school admissions process \"is narrowly tailored, as a matter of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For support, they unearth language from <i>Associated General Contractors of California v. San Francisco Unified School District,</i> a 1980 case in which we addressed a challenge to a School Board policy requiring that \"bidders for construction contracts ... must be minority general contractors or must utilize minority subcontractors for 25[percent] in dollar volume of the contract work.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375613\"><a href=\"/opinion/375613/24-empl-prac-dec-p-31422-27-contcasfed-cch-80416-associated/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1383 (9th Cir.1980). At the heart of their challenge, the contractors asserted that the quota violated California law requiring that all school contracts (except those involving <i>de minimis</i> expenditures) be awarded solely to \"the lowest responsible bidder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1385 (discussing and quoting Cal. Educ.Code &#167; 39640). In defense, the School Board asserted not only that its policy was <i>permissible,</i> but that the policy was <i>required</i> in order to remedy past discrimination &#8212; and therefore that insofar as it would prevent maintenance of such a policy, California's low-bid law violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, &#167; 2. <i>Id.</i> at 1386.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We flatly rejected that argument, drawing a distinction between \"reshuffle programs\" and \"stacked deck programs,\" <i>id.</i> at 1386, and placing the Board's quota in the latter category of race-based policies. We explained the central difference between these two categories as follows: While reshuffle programs \"neither give[ ] to nor withhold[ ] from anyone any benefits because of that person's group status, but rather ensure[] that everyone in every group enjoys the same rights in the same place,\" so-called stacked deck programs \"specifically favor[ ] members of minorities in the competition with members of the majority for benefits that the state can give to some citizens but not to all.\" <i>Id.</i> In passing, we twice suggested that programs designed to desegregate schools are reshuffle programs, <i>see id. at 1386 &amp; 1387,</i> and elsewhere stated \"that `stacked deck' programs trench on Fourteenth Amendment values in ways that `reshuffle' programs do not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1387.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we held simply that although \"the state has an affirmative constitutional duty to use `reshuffle' programs to cure the effects of past or present <i>de jure</i> segregation..., there is no constitutional duty to engage in `stacked deck' affirmative action.\" <i>Id.</i> Of particular import, we never reached the Fourteenth Amendment question squarely implicated by this case: whether notwithstanding the absence of an obligation to adopt such a policy, its implementation of such a program was permissible. Instead, given our resolution of an underlying state law question, our assessment of that law's constitutionality, and the fact that the Court recently had granted certiorari in <i>Fullilove,</i> we <i>explicitly</i> declined to \"test the policy itself against the standard of the United States Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it might seem obvious that a case cannot control the resolution of an issue it expressly declined to confront, the School District nonetheless grasps at <i>Associated General's</i> furtive references to school desegregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> It argues that its racial classification is equivalent to the programs arguably favored by <i>Associated General,</i> and thus (reading that opinion at the highest level of generality) not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us begin with two interrelated observations. First, <i>Associated General</i> addressed neither school desegregation nor the use of race in educational admissions; it assessed a mechanical set-aside governing distribution of construction projects. Second, <i>Associated General</i> did not even purport to apply strict scrutiny to a particular racial classification (or, more specifically, an actual school desegregation program). Its Fourteenth Amendment analysis assessed only whether the use of certain types of classifications is required to remediate prior official race discrimination &#8212; not whether constitutional limits circumscribe the use of such classifications for non-remedial purposes, what those limits might be, and how they might affect the constitutionality of a particular policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two conclusions follow. First, <i>Associated General</i> sheds no light on how we are to apply the narrow tailoring analysis rendered applicable to <i>any</i> racial classification by <i>Croson,</i> 488 U.S. at 493-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And second, <i>Associated General's</i> assertions about the nature of school desegregation programs are &#8212; however one defines the term &#8212; <i>obiter dicta.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the School District argues that because reshuffle programs may be less invidious than stacked deck programs and thus, as a constitutional matter, somehow not subject to the stringencies of the narrow tailoring requirement &#8212; a proposition never embraced by this court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> and certainly not one reconcilable with binding Supreme Court holdings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> &#8212; it misapprehends the concept of narrow tailoring. The contours of narrow tailoring do not turn on the importance of the interest supporting the government's use of a racial classification (though such analysis, whatever its shape, surely is triggered by use of a racial classification in pursuit of a compelling interest), nor on the asserted degree of the intrusion that a particular use of race might render. The personal right to equal treatment is implicated any time the government employs race for any reason. <i>See Coalition, 122 F.3d at 702</i> (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 230, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is for those reasons that, as Judge Selya &#8212; in typically perspicuous fashion &#8212; has observed, a court applying strict scrutiny must focus on \"whether the concrete workings of the Policy merit constitutional sanction. Only by such particularized attention can we ascertain whether the Policy bears any necessary relation to the noble ends it espouses. In short, the devil is in the details.\" <i>Wessmann,</i> 160 F.3d at 798. Under strict scrutiny, no racial classification, no matter its context and no matter the nature or strength of the interest it serves, is exempt from the strictures of narrow tailoring, and this program plainly fails to satisfy them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if were we to accept that <i>Associated General</i> bears on this case, we observe that the School District's racial tiebreaker operates as a \"stacked deck\" program. Quite simply, it \"specifically favors members of [some races] in the competition with members of [other races] for benefits that the state can give to some citizens but not to all,\" <i>Associated General,</i> 616 F.2d at 1386 &#8212; here, of course, admission to particular high schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> As noted earlier, operation of the tiebreaker at Franklin causes whites to be admitted preferentially because they <i>are</i> white, and its operation at Ballard causes non-whites to be admitted preferentially simply because they <i>are not</i> white. To the argument that this program is \"non-selective,\" we can only express bewilderment: The racial tiebreaker is used to determine student admissions solely to oversubscribed &#8212; <i>and thus necessarily selective</i> &#8212; schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> Whatever <i>Associated General</i> says about school desegregation programs, this is not the programmatic design that we had in mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having accepted the School District's invocation of <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz</i> in support of the proposition that racial and ethnic diversity can generate constitutionally compelling benefits within the educational setting itself and our society at large, we ultimately are compelled to reject the School District's strained efforts both to eat its cake and have it too. Its racial tiebreaker &#8212; though enlisted in the service of admittedly worthy ends &#8212; plainly fails the narrow tailoring component of the Constitution's strict scrutiny test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approaching this case from a fundamentally divergent perspective, the dissent offers a spirited and thoughtful defense of the School District's racial tiebreaker. Although we have responded to a few of its more specific criticisms, we see little to gain from the kind of note-by-note combat so pervasive in modern judicial opinions. Rather, given the thoroughness with which we have articulated our respective analyses of the racial tiebreaker, we think there is more to gain by elucidating the core foundations of our dispute.

For although the District's asserted interests in the educational and societal benefits derivable from diverse schools mirror those embraced by <i>Grutter, see supra</i> at 960-65, the dissent quite properly notes that the School District has an appreciably different focus. Rather than primarily seeking the <i>internal academic benefits</i> of diversity, the District's chief focus is on the <i>broader social benefits</i> diversity can stimulate. <i>See post</i> at 991-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe this divergent emphasis changes the nature of the District's interests; they remain compelling, and thus can justify an appropriately limited use of race. <i>See supra</i> Sections III.B.3 &amp; III.C.3. But it does affect the degree to which the District can claim deference. With regard to its secondary pursuit of diversity's internal academic benefits, we believe that while limited deference to educational institutions arguably could be due when they pursue core goals, such deference is entirely unwarranted when they court tangential ones. Having proceeded from the premise that the internal academic benefits of diversity are secondary to the District's socialization mission, it is at best curious that the dissent nonetheless maintains we should defer to the District's particularly crude use of a most disfavored classification in their pursuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far more important, we see a crucial difference between a school's pursuit of the internal academic benefits of diversity and its pursuit of diversity's external social benefits. For although the former manifest within the District's schoolhouses, and thus are susceptible to ready appraisal exclusively by education policymakers, the \"democratic\" benefits attributable to classroom diversity are diffuse, manifest long after students leave the classroom, do so in contexts not subject to the exclusive oversight of teachers, and cannot be measured with skills possessed uniquely by educators. That is to say: While it is clear that educators are uniquely positioned to gauge how classroom discussions respond to shifts in classroom racial composition, they are not similarly well-positioned to assess how marginal changes in schoolhouse racial demographics affect how students interact with each other years after they leave school for the \"real world.\" And to the limited extent they may have such insight, the record does not suggest the District <i>ever</i> sought to appraise the long-term social effects of engineering proportional demographic changes in connection with its design of the tiebreaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the dissent's unfettered deference to the School District &#8212; a constitutional departure that we think undermines its supposed \"strict scrutiny\" of the tiebreaker &#8212; one of its most striking features is its lack of focus on the data.

The range in representation of Asians at the tiebreaker schools (19.3 percent, as Asian representation ranged from just 17.5 percent of students at Ballard to a whopping 36.8 percent of students at Franklin) was more than 3 times the size of the tiebreaker's <i>maximum</i> annual impact on overall white/non-white ratios; and the range in black representation (24.6 percent, ranging from 32.3 percent of students at Franklin to just 7.7 percent of students at Roosevelt) was more than 4 times the <i>maximum</i> annual white/non-white impact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> &amp;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These representational variances cut to the core of the dissent's defense of the tiebreaker's design. For if the tiebreaker's goal is (as the dissent characterizes it) to assure every student the opportunity to interact with the right ratio of different-looking peers in order to prepare them for life in our diverse society, the program plainly fails huge numbers of students. Consider: Roughly 600 black students at Garfield during the 2000-2001 school year were deprived of the chance to interact with a sufficient number of Asian students (12.5 percent of Garfield students versus 27.5 percent of students in the school population at large); more than 100 Latino students at Roosevelt were denied a chance to interact with an adequate number of African-American peers (7.1 percent of Roosevelt students versus 22.8 percent of the student population at large); 600 Asian students at Franklin were unable adequately to interact with Native American students (0.8 percent of Franklin students versus 2.5 percent of the student population at large). And thousands of other students left their schools not having been <i>inadequately exposed</i> to interaction with certain racial minorities, but rather having been <i>overexposed</i> to them &#8212; and thus likewise <i>not</i> having been readied \"to be effective participants in the racially diverse environment in which they exist.\" <i>Cf. post</i> at 1010-1011.

We have already explained that the individual right to equal treatment is implicated any time government uses race to apportion benefits or burdens. Here, in determining where some 300 students will attend high school, the School District crudely approximates the shades of their skin and assigns them to schools accordingly. Nonetheless, the dissent surprisingly suggests that not one of those students suffers a legally cognizable injury (whether such an injury can be justified or not) because the constitutional prohibitions against determinative racial preferences and quotas do not apply to secondary education, and because each of those students will get a basic education anyway. We address these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The dissent suggests that the constitutional prohibitions against determinative racial preferences and quotas do not apply within the secondary educational context because secondary schools do not employ race as a proxy for merit, and thus pose little risk of stigmatizing or stereotyping those they putatively benefit. <i>Post</i> at 999-1002.

Yet as the Court explained in rejecting that claim, \"The question here is not of a duty of the State to supply legal training, or of the quality of the training which it does supply, but of its duty when it provides such training to furnish it to the residents of the State upon the basis of an equality of right.\" <i>Missouri ex rel.

It is whether having made available a choice-based system of public education the District may use race to circumscribe parental choices in the way it has. The dissent's suggestion that it may do so because all are \"<i>equally</i> subject\" to such discrimination, <i>post</i> at 1012 (emphasis in original), cannot be correct: Across-the-board wrongs do not, as the dissent reasons, make a right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the dissent's thin scrutiny of the District's racial tiebreaker strays far from constitutional norms &#8212; and it inadvertently threatens to entrench a permanent regime of racial discrimination.

Between the 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years &#8212; while this litigation was pending &#8212; the school board expanded the band to +/15 percent, meaning that the tiebreaker would operate only if an oversubscribed school had fewer than 26 percent or more than 56 percent white students. During the 2000-01 school year, four of the city's five oversubscribed schools were considered integration positive and therefore employed the tiebreaker: Ballard, Franklin, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt.

First, a so-called \"thermostat\" was added to the plan: The School District would cease to use the racial tiebreaker for the year at any school once its use had brought the school into racial balance. Second, the integration tiebreaker would be used only in determining the makeup of entering ninth grade classes, but would not be applied to assignments involving the limited number of students seeking to transfer high schools before the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grades.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Of course, this also means that at Franklin, non-whites are denied admission because they<i>are not</i> white; and at Ballard, whites are denied admission because they <i>are</i> white.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Wash.

The diversity interest in K-12 education is much simpler: that children learn to interact with peers of different races. That interest requires that there <i>be</i> children of different races in the classroom. Rather than relying on stereotypes, intergroup contact has the opposite effect; it inhibits the formation of stereotypes by teaching children that \"all people are different no matter what their color or ethnic background.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, the District's focus on racial diversity is not a presumption that students of the same race will share common viewpoints; the presence of students of different races is meant to break down, rather than to further, racial stereotypes by giving students an opportunity to learn that race does not signal an individual's viewpoint, perspective, or background.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the holistic review necessary to achieve \"true diversity\" is of even less relevance to the District's interest in preventing and ameliorating de facto racial segregation.

In 1962, the central area's Garfield High School reported 64 percent minority enrollment (it accommodated 75 percent of all black students), and six of the central area elementary schools had at least 75 percent minority enrollment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28-1\" id=\"fn28-1_ref\">28</a> Meanwhile, the eight high schools serving other major areas of the city remained more than 95 percent white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1960's, the District responded to this imbalance in various ways. It granted the central area principals' request for special financial assistance. It responded to racial tensions by experimenting with exchange programs, in which a handful of students switched high schools for several weeks. And in 1963, the District implemented a voluntary racial transfer program, through which a student could transfer to any school with available space, if the transfer would improve the racial balance at the receiving school. Although this program had some positive results, it did not reduce the racial imbalance significantly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970's, the District stepped up its efforts. It adopted a plan to desegregate central-area middle schools by requesting volunteers to transfer between minority- and majority-dominated neighborhood schools and ordering mandatory transfers when the numbers of volunteers were insufficient. The District also took steps to desegregate Garfield High School by changing its educational program, improving its facilities, and eliminating the \"special transfers\" that had allowed white students to leave the Garfield area. In addition, for the 1977-78 school year, the District instituted a magnet-school program to promote desegregation. According to the District's history: While it appeared evident that the addition of magnet programs would not in itself desegregate the Seattle schools, there was supportive evidence that voluntary strategies, magnet and non-magnet, could be significant components of a more comprehensive desegregation plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the 1977-78 school year, Franklin was 78 percent minority, Rainier Beach 58 percent, Cleveland 75 percent, and Garfield 64 percent.

Because of Seattle's housing patterns, the District's planners explained that \"it was impossible to fashion clusters in a geographically contiguous manner\"; some cluster schools were near the student's home, but others were in \"racially and culturally different neighborhoods.\" Although roughly 70 percent of students received their first choices, the Controlled Choice plan still resulted in mandatory busing for 16 percent of the District's students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1990's, District staff were directed to devise a new plan for <i>all</i> grade levels to simplify assignments, reduce costs, and increase community satisfaction, among other things; the guiding factors were to be choice, diversity, and predictability.

The District sought to maintain its commitment to integrated education by establishing diversity goals, but moving away from the rigid desegregation guidelines and mandatory assignments prevalent in the 1970's and 1980's.

When the District moved from its Controlled Choice plan to the current, open choice Plan, it predicted that families would tend to choose schools close to their homes. Indeed, this feature was seen as a positive way to increase parental involvement. However, unfettered choice &#8212; especially with tiebreakers based on neighborhood or distance from a school &#8212; raised the risk that Seattle's high school enrollment would begin to reflect its segregated housing patterns. The District's 2000-01 enrollment data showed that, of the students living in the southern half of Seattle, only 23 percent are white (6,247 out of 27,377 students), as compared with 64 percent of the students living in the northern half of the city (12,571 out of 19,555 students).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is de facto residential segregation across this white/ nonwhite axis that the District has battled historically and that it sought to prevent by making the integration tiebreaker a part of its open choice Plan. Although I have no doubt that other forms of race-based tension exist, <i>see</i> maj. op. at 983-84 n. 47, the District reasonably placed its focus here. The District has consistently faced a pattern in which its white students live predominately in the northern half of the city (in 2000-2001, 66.8 percent of the District's white students lived in the northern half of the city) and its students of color &#8212; in <i>each</i> of the three largest categories that the District tracks<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34-1\" id=\"fn34-1_ref\">34</a> &#8212; live predominately in the southern half of the city. In 2000-2001, 74.2 percent of the District's Asian students, 83.6 percent of its Black students, and 65 percent of its Hispanic students lived in the southern half of the city:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <pre>       2000-01 ENROLLMENT BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n-----------------------------------------------------\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA    ASIAN   BLACK    HISPANIC   WHITE\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    NORTH          2,879   1,778     1,693     12,571\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    SOUTH          8,269   9,054     3,145      6,247\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    TOTAL         11,148   10,832    4,838     18,818\n-----------------------------------------------------\n PERCENTAGE OF\nSTUDENTS SOUTH     74.2%   83.6%     65.0%      33.2%\n-----------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p>Moreover, Seattle's peculiar geography makes its northern neighborhoods and schools distant from its southern neighborhoods and schools. In these circumstances, the District permissibly could prioritize white/nonwhite, primarily north/ south, movement. This white/nonwhite focus also is consistent with the history of public school integration measures in this country, as reflected in a current federal regulation defining \"[m]inority group isolation\" as \"a condition in which minority group children constitute more than 50 percent of the enrollment of the school,\" without distinguishing among the various categories included within the definition of \"[m]inority group.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 280.4(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To discourage choices that would perpetuate this north-south division between the district's white and nonwhite populations, the District gave priority to choices that would counter it and create north-south movement within the District. In the 2000-01 school year, the integration tiebreaker operated in four high schools (that is, four high schools were oversubscribed and deviated by more than 15 percent from the ratio of white to nonwhite students District-wide). Although the integration tiebreaker was a limited measure, in contrast to the District's previous efforts, it did serve to alter the imbalance in the schools in which it operated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's contrary view is based on a skewed presentation of the enrollment statistics. Figures reflecting the tiebreaker's total effect on a school's enrollment, such as those cited in the majority opinion, <i>see</i> maj. op. at 984 (\"Table 2\"), 985 (\"Table 3\"), 985 (citing a maximum shift of 6.1 percent in the white/nonwhite ratio), artificially minimize the tiebreaker's effect by failing to recognize that students enter the ninth grade in much greater numbers than they transfer to other schools after the ninth grade. The following statistics submitted by the District, which portray directly the effect of the tiebreaker on the make-up of the ninth grade classes at the four affected schools, illustrate the function of the tiebreaker far more accurately:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <pre>2000-01 CHANGE IN PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS OF COLOR IN\n                 NINTH GRADE CLASSES\n------------------------------------------------------\n                WITHOUT         WITH\n              INTEGRATION   INTEGRATION   PERCENT\n  SCHOOL      TIEBREAKER    TIEBREAKER    CHANGE\n------------------------------------------------------\n FRANKLIN        79.2          59.5       - 19.7\n------------------------------------------------------\nNATHAN HALE      30.5          40.6       + 10.1\n------------------------------------------------------\n  BALLARD        33.0          54.2       + 21.2\n------------------------------------------------------\n ROOSEVELT       41.1          55.3       + 14.2\n------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the majority's references to a 6.1 percent maximum shift do not tell the whole story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, without the integration tiebreaker, the freshman classes at some of the affected north-end schools may well have been sufficiently diverse to promote interaction across the white/nonwhite axis and to prevent the tokenization of nonwhite students. <i>See</i> maj. op. at 984 n. 49. However, without the integration tiebreaker, the Plan would have operated to prevent students of color who lived in the south end of Seattle from attending those schools because of the schools' distance from south-end neighborhoods. The tiebreaker furthered the District's goal of giving south-end students of color the opportunity to opt out of attending the more racially concentrated schools in their neighborhoods, if they so desired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, the integration tiebreaker does not attempt to achieve perfect adherence to the District-wide ratios in each of the District's high schools. Except by encouraging an optout, the tiebreaker does not directly alter the racial make-up of schools that are not oversubscribed, even that of the south-end schools that diverge widely from District-wide proportions. <i>See supra</i> note 13. I do not, however, view the Plan's underinclusiveness as a fatal flaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, I find it peculiar that the majority's rebuttal makes so much of the failure of the District's Plan to achieve perfect racial balance. To be sure, in strict scrutiny review, especially in the First Amendment context, a law's underinclusiveness can be a sign that the enacting authority was not in fact motivated by its stated objectives. <i>See Republican Party of Minn. v.

Apparently, in order for the majority to find that a race-conscious means is necessary to achieve the District's stated goals, the means would have to produce perfect adherence to the District's racial make-up &#8212; which, in Seattle's circumstances, only aggressive districting, forced busing, and more intrusive racial classifications could do. However, requiring that the chosen means achieve perfect balance would make strict scrutiny impossible to satisfy, because the burden caused by the Plan &#8212; the third element of the narrow-tailoring inquiry &#8212; would be enormous. That is why, in contexts more relevant to this case, such as employment, courts have found that the modesty &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> the underinclusiveness &#8212; of government action is a point <i>in favor</i> of a conclusion that the action was narrowly tailored. <i>See, e.g., Cotter v.

By affording deference to the university's identification of its core educational values in this context, the Court simply recognized that whether a race-neutral measure is truly an alternative in the first place depends on whether that measure is consistent with an institution's core values.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority faults the District for failing to consider seriously three specific race-neutral measures. Maj. op. at 970-975. One of the majority's suggestions &#8212; that the District measure and assign students according to their \"true diversity,\" maj. op. at 971-72 &#8212; cannot properly be considered an \"alternative,\" because it is not directed toward achieving the District's interest in a racially integrated learning environment. <i>See supra</i> pp. 1001. Furthermore, it is clear from the record that the school board <i>has</i> discussed the use of other diversity measures, including poverty, as a tiebreaker. Although the majority correctly points out that there has been no formal study of that proposal by District staff, Board members' testimony reveals two legitimate reasons why the majority of the Board rejected the use of poverty measures to reach its goal of racial diversity: one, it is insulting to minorities and often inaccurate to assume that the two populations are coextensive; and, two, implementation would be thwarted by high school students' reluctance to reveal their socioeconomic status to their peers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also asserts that the District should have considered more formally a proposal developed by the Urban League (which, incidentally, did not eliminate the integration tiebreaker, but merely demoted it). Maj. op. at 973-75. The majority quotes at length from the colorful and often emotional testimony of one Board member, who clearly was not impressed by the proposal. But there was other testimony from other Board members suggesting that the Board was aware of, and informally considered, the Urban League's proposal. Board member Schaad-Lamphere testified that she remembers reading the Urban League's plan and considered it to be similar to other regional assignment plans being proposed at the same time; she testified that she weighed it as she did other community input. Furthermore, the testimony of Board member Nielsen is consistent with Superintendent Olchefske's understanding that regional plans, including the Urban League's, had been disfavored by the Board because of the high value the District placed on choice among the different academic offerings at the various high schools. In other words, when all the testimony in the record is examined, it is clear that the Urban League's plan was in fact considered and that it was rejected for legitimate educational reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36-1\" id=\"fn36-1_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority concludes that such informal consideration is inadequate and that we should evaluate the District's consideration of race-neutral alternatives using the same rigorous evidentiary standard that we use to evaluate whether a local government has proved that past discrimination justified its enactment of a remedial minority set-aside program. Maj. op. at 972 (citing cases that elucidate the latter standard). To the contrary, our cases on set-aside programs plainly employ different standards to these different analyses &#8212; with a more permissive view toward the analysis of race-neutral alternatives. <i>Compare Coral Constr.

The majority is incorrect in its conclusion that the District must do so, despite the harm that a lottery would do to the goals of choice and parental involvement that lie at the heart of its educational mission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37-1\" id=\"fn37-1_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a closer question whether the District's goals could be met by using a pure lottery <i>tiebreaker</i> &#8212; that is, a lottery to determine which of the students who had <i>chosen</i> a particular school would be enrolled there. This format would allow the District to retain its emphasis on choice and would cause unhappiness more randomly. However, as Superintendent Olchefske explained, District patterns suggested that more people would choose schools close to home, thus raising the justifiable concern that the pool of students choosing a particular school would be skewed in favor of the demographic of the surrounding residential area. Indeed, when the District adopted the Plan, it could not predict exactly how much harm open choice would do to the racial diversity of its schools. A lottery, in the face of this uncertainty, would have left the District without a safety net for its diversity goals and, moreover, would have prevented the District from furthering the policy goals reflected in its sibling and proximity tiebreakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the long history of its efforts to achieve integrated schools, the District has experimented with many alternatives, including magnet and other special-interest programs, which it continues to employ, and race-conscious districting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38-1\" id=\"fn38-1_ref\">38</a> But when a racially integrated school system is the goal (or racial isolation is the problem), there is no more effective means than a consideration of race to achieve a solution. Even Plaintiff's expert conceded that, \"if you don't consider race, it may not be possible to offer an integrated option to students.... [I]f you want to guarantee it you have to consider race.\" As Superintendent Olchefske stated, \"when diversity, meaning racial diversity, is part of the educational environment we wanted to create, I think our view was you took that issue head on and used &#8212; you used race as part of the structures you developed.\" The logic of this point is sound: When race is a principal element of the government's compelling interest, then race-neutral alternatives seldom will be equally efficient. <i>Cf.

Specifically, Plaintiff suggests that, even when they are considered \"out of balance\" by the District (i.e., when they deviate from the 60/40 ratio by more than 15 percent and thus enroll less than 45 percent or more than 75 percent nonwhite students), Seattle's oversubscribed schools are sufficiently racially diverse to achieve the District's goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I disagree that the District's means significantly overshoot its goals. First, the District is trying to teach its students to be effective participants in the racially diverse environment in which they exist. Superintendent Olchefske noted that Seattle's school-age demographic is significantly more racially diverse than the demographic for its population as a whole. (\"There [are] a lot of elderly white people in this town,\" he noted.) And he stated that the District has no regular access to data on the racial make-up of Seattle's private school students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the racial mix at <i>some</i> of the oversubscribed high schools would be sufficiently diverse for the District to achieve its goals<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39-1\" id=\"fn39-1_ref\">39</a> in those schools without the integration tiebreaker, this fact would not account for the effect of the integration tiebreaker on the overall school system. A clear objective of the School Board was that \"no child should be required to attend a racially concentrated school.\" Removing the integration tiebreaker would mean that non-white students living in the southern area of the city, where neighborhoods and schools are more racially concentrated, would not have an opportunity for access to the more diverse schools in the northern part of the city, simply because of where they live. Giving them this access furthers the District's diversity goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the fact that a particular oversubscribed high school would draw a sufficiently diverse population in a given year without the integration tiebreaker does not guarantee that it would continue to do so. As I discussed above, open choice puts school assignment in the hands of the students; a tiebreaker tied to the District's racial demographic is a natural way for the District to retain a safety net.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Flexibility</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District also has shown that its Plan is flexible in the short term and that its approach has been flexible over the long term. The District no longer forces white students south, nor nonwhite students north. For this reason, racial concentration has increased in some schools. But the District's response has been measured. Responsive to community concerns and its own educational goals, the District has abandoned its complicated and mandatory systems for integrating its schools. Instead, it has developed a system that gives south-end non-white students an opportunity to leave racially concentrated schools (if they wish to) and promotes integrated schools across the district, while preserving the choice that it considers so critical to parental involvement. Mandatory assignments are kept to a minimum,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40-1\" id=\"fn40-1_ref\">40</a> and waivers are permitted for various reasons. The District's consistent movement from coercive to voluntary integration measures lends credence to its argument that it is working, through improvements to its programs, to reduce or eliminate oversubscription and therefore to reduce its reliance on the integration tiebreaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Plan is not inflexible in the manner of a quota; the integration tiebreaker operates only when <i>patterns of individual choice</i> result in oversubscription, and only until the school approximates the characteristics of the district as a whole. Choice, not a prescribed ratio of white to nonwhite students, controls the overwhelming majority of assignments. And choice patterns have been shown to change over time, as new facilities and programs are offered at different schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District has demonstrated its ability to be responsive to these choice patterns and to the concerns of its constituents. It revisits the plan annually.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41-1\" id=\"fn41-1_ref\">41</a> In 2000, when a higher than normal number of students selected the same schools, the Board responded by increasing the integration trigger from a 10 percent to a 15 percent deviation from the school population and adopting a \"thermostat\" that turns off the integration tiebreaker as soon as the school has come into balance. The majority considers it constitutionally significant that the Board rejected a staff suggestion that the trigger instead be increased to 20 percent. Board members testified that they rejected a 20 percent trigger, in effect, because it would fail to assist students in moving from racially concentrated south-end schools. In other words, the proposed 20 percent trigger would no longer promote the Board's goals; it therefore could not be considered narrowly tailored to achieve the District's compelling interest because it would not achieve that interest at all. The Board's decision thus is not a sign that the Board has failed, as the majority suggests, to \"minimize [the] adverse impact on third parties,\" maj. op. at 975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Relative burden on third parties.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority assumes that every student who is denied his or her choice of schools because of the integration tiebreaker suffers a constitutionally significant burden. As I foreshadowed above, however, I consider the District's Plan to impose a minimal burden that is shared equally by all of the District's students. <i>See Parents Involved,</i> 72 P.3d at 159-60 (noting that the burden of not being allowed to attend one's preferred school is shared by all students equally).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we view the Plan on the large scale, without attempting to anticipate students' subjective and shifting preferences for different schools, all the District's students are <i>equally</i> subject to the possible burden of being denied their first choices. Only when we conceive of the Plan narrowly, by imagining two students &#8212; one white, one nonwhite &#8212; who are next door neighbors and have identical preferences for Ballard or for Franklin high school, will one student bear a \"burden\" and the other gain a \"benefit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet it is well established that \"there [is] no right under Washington law to attend a local school or the school of the student's choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42-1\" id=\"fn42-1_ref\">42</a> Of course, students and their parents will nonetheless prefer some schools over others; their preferences may be based on their perceptions of a school's academic quality, on their subjective preference for a particular educational theme or program, or on the convenience of attending a particular school, among other things. These preferences result in changing choice patterns and the oversubscription of certain high schools. But oversubscribed schools do not become a limited government resource because of their popularity in a given year or their convenience for a given family. <i>See Hampton,</i> 102 F.Supp.2d at 380 n. 43 (\"The Court understands that students and their parents might prefer one school over another. The preference may even arise from a perception that one school is better than others due to its location, its teachers and principal, or its classroom environment. However, these matters of personal preference do not distinguish those schools in a constitutionally significant sense.\"); <i>see also supra</i> note 24. Despite any differences in academic quality (or perceptions thereof), all students who enroll in a Seattle high school will receive a high school education that meets state standards. And, as the District points out, even if Plaintiff's assertions of objectively unequal school quality were accepted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43-1\" id=\"fn43-1_ref\">43</a> it is undisputed that the integration tiebreaker operates to give every student an opportunity to attend at least one of five oversubscribed \"quality\" high schools (because at least one is \"integration positive\" for both white and nonwhite students). I do not believe that students' subjective preferences for one school over another, where the existence and educational relevance of objective differences among them is disputed, make the inconvenience of a nonpreferred assignment weightier than the District's legitimate educational goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the District has minimized any burden by working to ameliorate the inconvenience and frustration for families who do not receive their preferred school assignments. When the popularity of the District's five oversubscribed schools spiked for 2000-01 assignments, the School Board met to consider ways to soften the adverse effects. The administration immediately began to \"aggressively move the waitlists\" and to attempt to increase capacity at the oversubscribed schools. The Board and the administration discussed specific, long-range plans to increase the attractiveness of the undersubscribed schools. Finally, the District reached out to students receiving assignments to undersubscribed schools to share with them advantages of the schools of which they may not have been aware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. <i>Conclusion.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all these reasons, the Plan adopted by the Seattle School District for high school assignments is constitutional notwithstanding its inclusion of an integration tiebreaker.

The cited cases do not support the majority's sweeping statements. First, the Court in <i>Croson</i> held that a minority set aside was prohibited because the government could not prove that past discrimination provided a compelling reason for the program, not because \"racial balancing\" as a mechanism for achieving a compelling state interest would necessarily be inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, states are prohibited from making race the <i>predominant</i> factor in drawing legislative districts because of the impermissibility of racial stereotyping (that is, using race as a proxy for political characteristics), not because any consideration of a district's racial proportions is per se improper. <i>See Bush v.
