This case, however, presents\n\nthe Court with a complicated set of facts, which, as demonstrated\n\nby the Panel’s Opinion, can easily confuse even the most\n\nexperienced jurist. Smith contends oral argument is warranted to\n\ncut through the confusion and ensure that this Court appreciates\n\nthe legal distinctions arising in this case that make all the\n\ndifference in the outcome of the Opinion. Simply put, Smith is\n\nconfident that a collective discussion regarding the legal issues in\n\nthis case will result in a different outcome. As such, Smith\n\nrespectfully requests this Court hold oral argument before disposing\n\nof this Motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 v\n\f              EN BANC RECONSIDERATION ARGUMENT\n\n        Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 41.2(c) provides that, while\n\nen banc consideration of cases is “disfavored,” it should be ordered\n\nif:\n\n       “necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the\n        court’s decisions,” or\n\n       if “extraordinary circumstances” require.\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 41.2(c). In this case, both situations are presented by\n\nthis case.\n\n        “Unless a court of appeals chooses to hear a case en banc, the\n\ndecision of a panel constitutes the decision of the whole court.”\n\nO’Connor v. First Ct. of Appeals, 837 S.W.2d 94, 96 (Tex. 1992). The\n\ncurrent Opinion (attached to this Motion as Tab A) contradicts not\n\nonly this Court’s precedent, but also conflicts with Texas Supreme\n\nCourt precedent regarding the pleading and proof requirements\n\nunderlying the award of attorney’s fees. Texas Rule of Appellate\n\nProcedure 49.7 authorizes this Court to consider en banc a case\n\nthat was previously considered by a panel of this Court. TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 49.7. Smith respectfully requests this Court use the authority\n\nafforded in Rule 49.7 and reconsider this case en banc.\n\n\n                                    1\n\fARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n                     EN BANC\n\n                                     I.\n                                INTRODUCTION\n\n     Although this direct appeal raised numerous complex legal\n\nchallenges to the trial court’s judgment regarding the existence of a\n\npublic road, easements, and adverse possession, this Motion for En\n\nBanc Consideration focuses on only one of the issues raised in the\n\ndirect appeal: the amount of attorney’s fees awarded by the trial\n\ncourt. This Court, in its Panel Opinion, Tab A, affirmed the award.\n\n     This    Court’s   holding,    however,    ignores   the   “narrowing”\n\nlanguage in the trial court’s final judgment. Here is what the\n\nundisputed evidence demonstrates:\n\n        the lawsuit raised numerous causes of actions by both\n\n            parties;\n\n        the parties pleaded for attorney’s fees under some of the\n\n            causes of action;\n\n        the trial court awarded attorney’s fees under only one\n\n            cause of action: breach of contract (Chapter 38) (the trial\n\n            court’s judgment is attached to this Motion as Tab B);\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\f         during the hearing on attorney’s fees, both parties’\n\n          counsel segregated their fees, agreeing that only 10% of\n\n          the fees incurred were for the breach of contract claim\n\n          (approximately $8,000);\n\n         even though it awarded attorney’s fees based on only on\n\n          the breach of contract cause of action, the trial court\n\n          erroneously awarded an amount of attorney’s fees that\n\n          constituted 100% of the attorney’s fees incurred for all\n\n          causes of action (approximately $80,000);\n\n         this Court then mistakenly affirmed that excess award of\n\n          attorney’s fees;\n\nIn affirming the attorney’s fees award, the Panel allowed for the full\n\namount of attorney’s fees by stating that the trial court could have\n\nawarded the full amount of fees based on the cause of action arising\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act (Chapter 37).\n\n     While it would be a different case if the trial court’s judgment\n\nwas silent as the basis of the attorney’s fees award, that is not the\n\ncase before this Court. Here, the trial court specified that it was\n\nawarding fees based only on the breach of contract claim. Tab B.\n\nThe Panel ignored that language. It is true that the trial court could\n                                  3\n\fhave awarded fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act (Chapter\n\n37), but the record shows that the trial court chose not to do so. Tab\n\nB. In essence, this Court chose to rewrite the trial court’s final\n\njudgment   to   include    a   provision   awarding   fees   under   the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act in order to get to its holding. Tab A.\n\n     Even more disturbing, the Panel ignored the agreement of the\n\nparties to offer evidence of their attorney’s fees in a segregated\n\nmanner. Counsel for each side agreed that only 10% of the\n\nattorney’s fees incurred was for the breach of contract claim. Yet,\n\nthe Panel ignored the trial court’s limiting language, as well as the\n\nparties’ agreement, in affirming an award for 100% of the fees.\n\n     The Opinion from the Panel blazes new ground, but in a way\n\nthat is contrary to well established precedent from the Supreme\n\nCourt of Texas. This Court should grant this Motion for En Banc\n\nConsideration to withdraw this erroneous Opinion and remedy the\n\nharm that will be suffered by Smith.\n\n                                  II.\n                          FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n     This direct appeal centered on the status of a road in Edwards\n\nCounty. The road, referred to throughout the record as “Spur\n\n\n                                    4\n\fRoad,” crosses through a small portion of the Reid Ranch (a 1,247-\n\nacre ranch owned by Appellees1) before entering the 640-acre Smith\n\nRanch.2 After a bench trial, the trial court ruled in favor of Reid,3\n\nfinding Spur Road was not a county road, that Spur Road was not\n\nan easement appurtenant to the Smith Ranch, and ordered Smith\n\nto pay nearly $80,000 in attorney’s fees (plus $20,000 in appellate\n\nattorney’s fees). (3CR644).\n\n      Spur Road\n\n      Spur Road (black line in the image below) is a 2/3-mile\n\nroadway that leaves County Road 330, crosses the Reid Ranch from\n\nEast to West, and then enters the Smith Ranch:\n\n\n\n\n1\n Plaintiffs/Appellees are referred to in this Brief collectively as “Reid.” The Reid\nRanch is comprised of Tracts One through Nine. (3CR654). The Reid Ranch\nwas purchased by Royce I. Reid in 1953. (3CR654; 2RR45).\n2Defendant/Appellant is Randy K. Smith, referred to in this Brief as “Smith.”\n\nThe Smith Ranch comprises two tracts, one being 639.192 acres purchased in\n2003 and one being 81.03 acres purchased in 2010. (3CR654-55).\n3Edwards County was joined as a Cross-Defendant as an “interested party”\n\nunder the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act. (2CR464).\n                                         5\n\f(PE1) (yellow: County Road 330; blue: Pulliam Creek; black: Spur\n\nRoad) (2RR23, 48, 50-51, 208-09; 3RR13-14).\n\n        When Spur Road begins (off of County Road 330), there is no\n\ngate, cattle guard, sign, or fence denying the public access to the\n\nroad:\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\f(PE10A; 2RR80).\n\n     For as long as anyone can remember, Spur Road has been\n\nutilized by neighboring property owners without protest by Reid or\n\nReid’s predecessors in title.4 Public documents show that the\n\nEdwards County Road Department has been performing road\n\nmaintenance on Spur Road since the mid-1970s. (DE3) (verbal\n\nstatement of Lee Sweeten, current Precinct #2 Commissioner of\n\nEdwards County, Texas, that he performed road maintenance work\n\n\n\n\n(2RR272, 280). The parties stipulated that Spur Road is a spur off County\n4\n\nRoad 330, which has formerly been known as County Road 204. (2RR21).\n                                    7\n\fon said spur while employed by the Edwards County Road\n\nDepartment in the mid-1970s).\n\n     Denman L. Cloudt, who is Smith’s predecessor in title,5 had\n\nalways used Spur Road to access the Smith Ranch during his\n\nownership. (2RR172) (“Oh, yes, we used it. My hunters used it. That\n\nwas the only entrance into the property.”); (2RR180). Cloudt also\n\nstated,     “[l]ater on    we   found        [another entrance] down       here\n\nsomewhere . . . but it’s in — it’s in almost an impossible place to\n\nmaintain. . . . [b]ecause of the flood damage that occurs when you\n\nhave a flood in that country. . . . it’s impossible to build a crossing\n\nat that other place.” (2RR172-73). Cloudt spent over $50,000 on\n\ncrossings over Pulliam Creek and “[t]hey are barely usable now.”\n\n(2RR172, 174).\n\n     The Commissioners Court’s 1998 Order affirming Spur\n     Road as a county road.\n\n     While he still owned the property, Cloudt took steps to ensure\n\nthat Spur Road was officially classified as a county road:\n\n\n\n\n5Cloudt   still owns 423 acres to the east of the Smith Ranch. (2RR176).\n                                         8\n\f(PE17) (Cloudt's affidavit) (cropped).\n\n     In   1998,    the   Edwards       County   Commissioners   Court\n\nunanimously passed a motion to declare:\n\n           [Spur Road] has been considered part of the\n           County road system & whereas, said spur has\n           been historically worked as a county road,\n           therefore, be it resolved that it is hereby\n           confirmed that it is part of the County Road\n           system and shall remain as such for all\n           purposes.\n\n(DE5).\n\n     Smith leases and then buys 640 acres (“the Smith\n     Ranch”) from Cloudt.\n\n     In 2000, Smith leased the 640 acres south of Reid Ranch from\n\nCloudt (this acreage is referred to throughout the litigation as “the\n\nSmith 640” and “the Smith Ranch”). (3CR656; 2RR204; 3RR11).\n\nWhen investigating whether to lease (and then later, whether to\n\n\n                                   9\n\fpurchase) the property, Smith used the Spur Road entrance to the\n\nproperty. (PE1; 2RR23, 48, 50-51, 208-09; 3RR13-14). Spur Road\n\noffered a desirable access point because it ran directly from County\n\nRoad 330 into the campsite located on Smith Ranch. (2RR237) (PE1\n\n[Smith campsite located where black line ends]).\n\n     During Smith’s three-year lease, Reid never objected to\n\nSmith’s use of Spur Road, which traveled right in front of the Reid\n\nhouse, before entering the Smith campsite. (2RR60, 159; 3RR11-\n\n14). Reid also never gave any indication to Smith or others that they\n\nhad no right to travel Spur Road.6 Smith, relying on Reid’s\n\nacquiescence and the free and uninterrupted travel during those\n\nthree years, paid approximately $600,000 to purchase the Smith\n\n640. (PE7; 2RR207-08; 3RR13, 58-59). The deed did not reference\n\n\n\n\n6\n Smith’s predecessors and others owning nearby property often used Spur\nRoad. (2RR58-59, 79) (“[S]o for at least 45 years we know as far as you know\nthat people traveling across your property to the south and to the west\nunimpeded? Yes.”). Evidence also revealed Reid and his foreman had multiple\ncontacts with Smith, even hiring Smith’s children to work on the Reid Ranch,\nbut Reid never once communicated to Smith that he had no right to use Spur\nRoad. (2RR122-23). Seven of Smith’s ten children worked on the Reid Ranch\nfeeding game, cleaning brush, or cleaning houses. (2RR215).\n                                     10\n\fan easement on Spur Road, because, as Cloudt claimed, the road\n\nwas public.7\n\n     After purchasing the ranch, Smith, in reliance on the usability\n\nof the Spur Road entrance, expended vast resources and time\n\nimproving the Smith Ranch. (2RR221-27) (describing multiple\n\nrefurbished trailers, electricity, septic systems, water pump system,\n\nand rain catchment systems); (3RR42-43) (describing improvements\n\nand estimating their cost at $125,000 to $140,000).\n\n     During the entirety of the time Smith and his ten children\n\nlived on Smith Ranch full time, Reid gave no indication to Smith or\n\nothers that Spur Road was a private road. (2RR79-80). Reid\n\nconceded that for “45-plus years [of his lifetime] there’s never been\n\na gate across the road that we’re talking about.” (2RR80). Reid also\n\nconceded no one “ever asked for his permission” to use Spur Road\n\nand that he has never “told anyone that they needed [his]\n\npermission to use the road.” (2RR81-82).\n\n     Use of Spur Road to access Smith Ranch is integral to Smith’s\n\nuse and enjoyment of the property. Where County Road 330 (yellow\n\n7\n (3RR47). Cloudt testified the documents do not mention an easement because\nEdwards County had already designated Spur Road as a county road.\n(2RR199). Cloudt told Smith, “That [Spur Road] is your access.” (2RR240).\n                                    11\n\fline) meets Spur Road (black line), there is a crossing over Pulliam\n\nCreek (blue line). (PE1; 2RR114). This creek crossing has washed\n\nout hundreds of times and been repaired by Edwards County for\n\nthe benefit of Reid and others using Spur Road. (2RR114). Over 600\n\nof Smith’s acreage is located across Pulliam Creek. (2RR115;\n\n3RR21). Reid acknowledged that if Smith is denied use of Spur\n\nRoad (whose crossing is maintained by Edwards County), Smith will\n\nhave to construct and maintain his own private crossing over\n\nPulliam Creek to access the 600 acres of his property on the other\n\nside of Pulliam Creek. (2RR116).\n\n     Smith purchases 80 more acres from Cloudt, triggering\n     Reid to contest Smith’s use of Spur Road to enter Smith\n     Ranch.\n\n     In 2010, Smith purchased another 80 acres from Cloudt that\n\nadjoined the Smith 640. (3CR657; 3RR58-59).\n\n\n\n\n                                   12\n\f(PE1). This newly-acquired tract abuts Highway 55. (3CR657).\n\n     After Reid learned that Smith had purchased the 80 acres with\n\nHighway 55 frontage, Reid began blocking Smith’s access to Spur\n\nRoad. (2RR60, 63, 110; PE11 [letter from Reid to Smith]). First,\n\nSmith arrived to find his gate to the 640 acres locked. (3RR18-19)\n\n(“There was a lock and I was really stunned, so I cut the lock and\n\nproceeded in. Then at some point we had some encounter and they\n\nverbally — I think it was Royce that expressed that we didn’t have a\n\nright to come through here, and I was rather stunned, to be honest\n\nwith you, because I thought all those matters had already been\n                                 13\n\fsettled with the Bay-Houston suit.”). Then, Reid placed tractors and\n\nboulders across Spur Road to block Smith’s entrance and exit via\n\nthe Spur Road access gate.8\n\n     Reid contends Smith should use the entrance to the property\n\nlocated off Highway 55 (the entrance that came with the newly-\n\npurchased 80 acres), but Smith testified to the impossibility of\n\nusing the Highway 55 entrance. (2RR216; 3RR21-26). To utilize this\n\nentrance, Smith is forced to leave the vehicles parked on the side of\n\nthe Highway 55 entrance and then have someone on the property\n\ncome pick them up with an all-terrain vehicle. (2RR230-31).\n\n     The Underlying Lawsuit\n\n     In 2010, Reid filed suit against Smith. (1CR8). Reid asked for a\n\ntemporary injunction and for a declaration that Smith has no right\n\nto use Spur Road. (1CR9-10). Reid was granted the temporary\n\ninjunction. (1CR38). Smith then answered the lawsuit with a\n\ngeneral denial. (1CR41).\n\n     The 2011 Resolution reaffirming Spur Road as a county\n     road.\n\n\n\n(3RR20). Since Smith’s purchase of the 80 acres, Reid has also stated Smith\n8\n\ndoes not have permission to cross from County Road 330, over the 20 feet of\nReid Ranch, to access Smith’s 80-acre tract. (2RR120).\n                                    14\n\f     After he got sued, Smith began looking for the public records\n\nrelated to Spur Road. (3RR61-62). Smith asked the Edwards\n\nCounty Commissioners to review the public documents and clarify\n\nthat Spur Road was a public road. (3RR62; DE4 [recounting that\n\nSmith testified before the Commissioners]). At a 2011 Meeting,\n\nCommissioner Sweeten moved that the Commissioners Court adopt\n\na resolution affirming Spur Road is a designated county road.\n\n(DE4). The Commissioners voted 4-0 to adopt the resolution. (DE4).\n\n     The Resolution provides:\n\n\n\n\n(DE3) (cropped).\n\n     The 2011 Resolution goes on to describe the evidence\n\nconsidered by the Commissioners:\n\n\n\n\n(DE3) (cropped).\n\n\n                                15\n\f      Finally, the 2011 Resolution goes on to note that Spur Road\n\nwas “inadvertently omitted” from the County Road Map and:\n\n\n\n\n(DE3) (cropped).\n\n      Reid adds a suit to remove a cloud on his title related to\n      the “bubble.”\n\n      In May 2011, Reid amended his petition to add an allegation\n\nrelated to a small, 1.165-acre piece of land located near the\n\nsouthern boundary of Reid Ranch and the northern boundary of the\n\nSmith 640. (PE2; 1CR46). This 1.165-acre piece has been referred\n\nto throughout this litigation as the “bubble.” The “bubble” contains\n\na natural spring that had been fenced around to avoid washouts.\n\n(2RR69-70, 74, 209-10, 213; 3RR37-38, 63). Reid’s new claim\n\nalleged prior owners of the two ranches had agreed the bubble was\n\na part of the Reid Ranch and that future owners would not claim\n\nthe bubble by adverse possession. (1CR46-47). Smith answered this\n\nnew   claim   by   asserting   a   limitations   defense   and   adverse\n\npossession. (3CR527).\n\n                                   16\n\f     The Bench Trial and Judgment\n\n     The trial court heard testimony from multiple witnesses and\n\nadmitted documentary evidence. (2RR-3RR [testimony]; 4RR [Reid’s\n\nexhibits]; 5RR [Smith’s exhibits]). The trial court’s final judgment\n\nprovides:\n\n   “There is no evidence of Edwards County acquiring public\n\n     interest in the spur by purchase, condemnation, dedication, or\n\n     a Court’s final judgment or any other law. Nor did the county\n\n     include the spur on its road map thereby clarifying its status\n\n     as a public road.”\n\n   “[T]he ‘spur road’ is not a public road.”\n\n   “[T]here are no access easements appurtenant . . . and\n\n     specifically that the ‘spur’ road at issue herein is not an\n\n     easement appurtenant.”\n\n   “[T]he 2003 Deed from D.L. Cloudt, Sr. to Randy K Smith . . .\n\n     creates a cloud upon the ‘Reid’ title. . . Throughout this trial\n\n     such land has been described as the ‘Bubble.’”\n\n   “Smith claimed such ‘bubble’ by virtue of adverse possession. .\n\n     . [T]he claim by Smith to adverse possession of the ‘bubble’\n\n     was in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so claim\n                                 17\n\f     land . . . by adverse possession, which covenant originated in\n\n     a agreement between RT Craig and Jay A. Blalock dated July\n\n     27, 1937.”\n\n   “Reid is entitled to enforce the terms of said express covenant\n\n     not to so claim land by adverse possession.”\n\n   “The Plaintiffs are granted a permanent injunction against\n\n     Defendant Randy K. Smith, his agents and employees,\n\n     prohibiting them from utilizing any portion of the Reid Ranch\n\n     to access the Smith property or any portion thereof.”\n\n   “Under the discretionary powers of the Court to award\n\n     attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice\n\n     and Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded attorney’s fees\n\n     against the Defendant, Randy K. Smith through the trial in the\n\n     amount of $79,171.30 and are conditionally awarded attorney\n\n     fees against Defendant Randy K. Smith in the event that the\n\n     Defendant Smith appeals this matter to the 4th Court of\n\n     Appeals in the amount of $20,000.”\n\n(3CR638-42). Smith timely filed his notice of appeal to this Court.\n\n(3CR703). The Panel then issued an Opinion affirming the\n\n\n\n                                 18\n\fjudgment in all respects other than to make the award of attorney’s\n\nfees on appeal contingent.\n\n                                      III.\n                THE ATTORNEY’S FEES AWARD MUST BE VACATED\n\n        The Panel erred by affirming the award of excess attorney’s\n\nfees.    This    Court   should    grant     this   Motion    for   En   Banc\n\nReconsideration, withdraw the Panel’s Opinion, and issue a new\n\nOpinion either vacating the award of attorney’s fees altogether or, at\n\na minimum, modifying the award to remove the excess amount from\n\nthe attorney’s fees award. Here is how the award of attorney’s fees\n\nwas erroneous:\n\n        Reid asked for attorney’s fees under multiple theories: (1) to\n\nremove the cloud on his title (related to the “Bubble”);9 (2) under\n\n“TRCP 38.001,” which is for breach of contract claims, (2CR474); (3)\n\nunder “the Declaratory Judgments Act,” (2CR474); and (4) “under\n\ncommon law.”10\n\n\n9\n (2CR467). Smith notes that attorney’s fees are not recoverable for suits to\nremove clouds on title. Sadler v. Duvall, 815 S.W.2d 285, 293–94 (Tex. App.-—\nTexarkana 1991, writ denied) (attorney’s fees not recoverable either under\nChapter 38 or as component of actual damages).\n10(2CR474). Importantly, Reid did not plead for attorney’s fees under Section\n\n5.006 of the Texas Property Code, which allows a party who succeeds in a\nbreach of covenant claim to recover attorney’s fees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\nANN. § 5.006(a) (“In an action based on breach of a restrictive covenant\n                                      19\n\f     When the trial court awarded attorney’s fees, it awarded them\n\nunder only one theory of recovery — Chapter 38. (3CR642)\n\n(emphasis added) (“Under the discretionary powers of the Court to\n\naward attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice\n\nand Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded attorney’s fees\n\nagainst the Defendant, Randy K. Smith through the trial in the\n\namount of $79,171.30 and are conditionally awarded attorney fees\n\nagainst Defendant Randy K. Smith in the event that the Defendant\n\nSmith appeals this matter to the 4th Court of Appeals in the\n\namount of $20,000”). (3CR642) (emphasis added). This award\n\nshould be vacated for multiple reasons.\n\nA.   The judgment awards attorney’s fees under Chapter 38,\n     but Reid neither pleaded nor succeeded on a Chapter 38-\n     based claim.\n\n     Chapter 38 is entitled, “Recovery of Attorney’s Fees.” TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001. It allows a person to recover\n\nattorney’s fees if the claim is for rendered services, performed labor,\n\nfurnished material, freight or express overcharges, lost or damages\n\nfreight or express, killed or injured stock, a sworn account, or an\n\n\n\npertaining to real property, the court shall allow a prevailing party who\nasserted the action reasonable attorney’s fees”).\n                                   20\n\foral or written contract. Id. The trial court awarded attorney’s fees\n\nunder Chapter 38. (3CR642). However, the case did not involve any\n\nclaims referenced in Chapter 38 nor did Reid succeed on any\n\nChapter 38 claims in order to be entitled to attorney’s fees. Id.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reverse and vacate the award of\n\nattorney’s fees against Smith.\n\n     Reid cannot salvage his attorney’s fees award by pointing to\n\nthe judgment’s ruling in favor of his Declaratory Judgment action.\n\nGorman v. Gorman, 966 S.W.2d 858, 866 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1998, pet. denied) (party successful in declaratory judgment\n\naction not entitled to attorney’s fees under Chapter 38). Nor can\n\nReid succeed by pointing to the judgment’s rulings related to his\n\nsuit to remove cloud on title or Smith’s purported breach of express\n\ncovenant. See Perez v. Tex. Disposal Sys., 103 S.W.3d 591, 592\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied) (no Chapter 38\n\nattorney’s fees for breach of covenent); Sadler v. Duvall, 815 S.W.2d\n\n285, 293–94 (Tex. App.-—Texarkana 1991, writ denied) (no Chapter\n\n38 attorney’s fees for suit to remove cloud on title).\n\n\n\n\n                                   21\n\fB.    The trial court’s findings indicate the award is tied to\n      the breach of covenant finding, but Reid did not plead for\n      such attorney’s fees.\n\n      A party’s failure to plead for attorney’s fees constitutes waiver\n\nof those fees. State Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leasing Enters., 716\n\nS.W.2d 553, 555 (Tex. App.-—Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.). As noted earlier, Reid asked for attorney’s fees for his suit to\n\nremove cloud on title,11 Chapter 37 (Texas’s Declaratory Judgment\n\nAct), Chapter 38, and “common law.” (2CR467, 474). Reid did not\n\nplead for attorney’s fees under Section 5.006, which allows a party\n\nwho succeeds in a breach of covenant claim to recover attorney’s\n\nfees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 5.006.\n\n      The trial court’s findings of fact provide: The agreement\n\nbetween RT Craig and Jay A. Blalock, dated July 27, 1937, is an\n\n\n Smith notes that Reid’s pleading contains a header entitled, “SUIT TO\n11\n\nREMOVE CLOUD ON TITLE AND FOR BREACH OF COVENANTS AND\nRESTRICTIONS.” (2CR466). However, the request for attorney’s fees contained\nwithin this section of the petition provides: Smith’s solicitation and recordation\nof the instrument from Cloudt to Smith and Smith’s continued claim of the\nright of possession of such property creates a cloud on Reid’s title to such\nlands, and accordingly, Reid requests that the court remove such clouding\n(Cloudt) instruments from Reid’s chain of title. In that respect, the Plaintiffs\nask for the award of attorney’s fees necessary to remove such cloud on, and to\nclarify the entire boundary between Section 49 and 50, plus costs of court,\nsuch amounts being in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of the\nCourt. (2CR466). The request for attorney’s fees found at the end of Reid’s\npetition references only Chapter 38, “the Declaratory Judgment Act,” and\n“common law” as authorizing an award of attorney’s fees to him. (2CR474).\n                                       22\n\fexpress covenant by Smith’s predecessors in title Not to Claim Land\n\nby Adverse Possession. (3CR660). Smith, in asserting a claim for\n\nadverse possession to land, breached such express covenant, and in\n\nso breaching, Smith is liable for attorney’s fees and costs under\n\nsection 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n(3CR660).\n\n     The trial court’s conclusion that Smith’s purported breach of\n\nthe express covenant renders him liable for attorney’s fees under\n\nChapter 38 is erroneous. Compare TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 38.001 (creating liability for attorney’s fees for, inter alia,\n\nsuccessful breach of contract), with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 5.006 (creating liability for attorney’s fees for successful\n\nbreach of covenant claim). Accordingly, this Court should reverse\n\nand vacate the award of attorney’s fees against Smith.\n\n     Moreover, even if this Court disregards the fact that the trial\n\ncourt conditioned its attorney’s fees award on Chapter 38, the Panel\n\nwas wrong in “rewriting” the judgment based on the trial court’s\n\nfindings of fact related to the purported breach of express covenant.\n\nReid is limited to the theories of attorney’s fees pleaded, and he\n\ncannot now be awarded attorney’s fees based on the unpleaded\n\n                                 23\n\fSection 5.006 theory. See Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Budget Rent–A–\n\nCar Sys., Inc., 796 S.W.2d 763, 771 (Tex.

Alternatively, the amount of fees awarded far exceeds the\n     percentage    of   fees  related   to  the    breach   of\n     contract/covenant finding.\n\n     If this Court rejects Smith’s request to vacate the attorney’s\n\nfees award in its entirety, this Court, at a minimum, must modify\n\nthe Panel’s Opinion that affirms the award of 100% of the attorney’s\n\n                                  24\n\ffees. At trial, Reid’s attorney testified Reid incurred a total of\n\n$87,613.30 in attorney’s fees. (3RR91-93; PE21-22) ($61,613.30 in\n\nattorney’s fees up until trial; $12,000 in attorney’s fees for trial\n\npreparation and trial; and $14,000 in paralegal fees). Texas law\n\nrequires segregation of attorney’s fees, Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.\n\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 310 (Tex. 2006), and Reid’s attorney\n\ncomplied with this requirement by offering evidence that 10% of the\n\nattorney’s fees were incurred in relation to Smith’s claim of adverse\n\npossession to the “Bubble.” (3RR94). Reid did not dispute this\n\nevidence in his briefing or oral argument.\n\n     Reid’s attorney also testified to the trial court that the\n\nremaining 90% of Reid’s fees were incurred for unrelated legal\n\nissues, some of which were abandoned before trial. (3RR94) (30% of\n\nthe time was spent on claims that were abandoned; 30% of the time\n\nwas spent on defending against the 2011 County Road Resolution;\n\n30% of the time was spent on “our affirmative claims . . . the\n\nrequest for the TRO, the request for declarations, the boundary,\n\ndefending the easement by estoppel and defending against the legal\n\neffect of the court-related items that were admitted a few minutes\n\nago, the '78 statement and the '98 actions of the commissioners\n\n                                 25\n\fcourt”).\n\n      As argued earlier, Reid neither pleaded nor succeeded on a\n\nChapter 38-based claim and Reid failed to plead for attorney’s fees\n\nunder Section 5.006, thus, the judgment for attorney’s fees should\n\nbe reversed and vacated. However, if this Court rejects these\n\nargument, then this Court should, at a minimum, modify the trail\n\ncourt’s judgment to reflect an amount that constitutes fees for the\n\nbreach of contract claim (as agreed to by the parties), 10%12 of\n\n$87,613.30 (or $8,761.33).

Rex Emerson, Judge Presiding\n\nOpinion by:       Rebeca C. Martinez, Justice\n\nSitting:          Catherine Stone, Chief Justice\n                  Karen Angelini, Justice\n                  Rebeca C. Martinez, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: December 23, 2014\n\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\n\n           Randy K. Smith appeals the trial court’s judgment enjoining him from using a road located\n\non property owned by Lawrence Reid, Royce H. Reid, Jennifer Heath, and THL GP, Inc.\n\n(collectively, the Reids). In four issues, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that\n\nthe road is not a public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3)\n\ndetermining that Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees. We\n\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to condition the award of appellate attorney’s fees on an\n\nunsuccessful appeal by Smith. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\f                                                                                     04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\n            The Reids are the owners of approximately 1,231.6-acres of real property located in\n\nEdwards County known as the Reid Ranch. The Reid Ranch consists of nine tracts of land. The\n\nReids trace their ownership of the ranch to Royce I. Reid, who acquired the ranch by General\n\nWarranty Deed dated May 14, 1953. The May 14, 1953 Warranty Deed does not contain any\n\nexception for any easement benefiting adjoining property.\n\n            Smith owns 720.222 acres of land adjoining the Reid Ranch (“Smith Ranch”). The Smith\n\nRanch includes two tracts: a 639.192-acre tract and an 81.03-acre tract (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe 640-acre tract and the 81-acre tract). Smith acquired the 640-acre tract from Denman L. Cloudt\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated May 8, 2003 (“Cloudt Deed”). The 81-acre tract was acquired\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated February 19, 2010. Neither Warranty Deed contains reference\n\nto conveyance of an easement or other appurtenant right over and across any portion of the Reid\n\nRanch.\n\n            Edwards County Road 330 originates at a point of intersection with State Highway 55 on\n\nthe southeastern boundary of Reid Ranch. County Road 330 traverses Reid Ranch. There is a\n\nroad known as “the spur road” which departs from Edwards County Road 330 in a generally\n\nwesterly direction crossing from east to west across portions of the Reid Ranch. Specifically, the\n\nspur road crosses the sixth tract and the third tract of the Reid Ranch. The spur road then enters\n\ninto the Smith Ranch at a point such that it intersects the boundary line between the Reid Ranch\n\nand the Smith Ranch. For a number of years, the Reids permitted Smith and his predecessors in\n\ntitle to use the spur road to conveniently access his 640-acre tract. The following map was admitted\n\nat trial:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n\n\n(The thick black line is the spur road; the yellow line is County Road 330; and the blue line is\n\nPulliam Creek).\n\n       Bay-Houston Towing Co. owned property south of the Smith Ranch. In 2007, Bay-\n\nHouston sued Smith in an attempt to establish the right to use the spur road to travel across Smith’s\n\nproperty. Because Bay-Houston also had to use a portion of the Reid Ranch to reach its property,\n\nSmith asked for leave of court to join the Reids in the litigation, and pointed out that both the Reids\n\nand “Edwards County officials . . . contest and dispute that this roadway over the Reid Ranch is a\n\npublic highway.” In their answer to Smith’s Third Party Petition, the Reids denied “that all or any\n\nportion of the roadway in question is a public road.” To avoid litigation, the Reids entered into a\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nRule 11 agreement with Bay-Houston providing that they would give Bay-Houston permission to\n\nuse the spur road across Reid Ranch if Bay-Houston won its suit against Smith. Smith then non-\n\nsuited his third party claim against the Reids. Bay-Houston lost at trial and was not allowed to use\n\nthe spur road across Smith’s property, thus rendering the Rule 11 agreement moot.\n\n           In February 2010, Smith purchased an additional 81-acre tract bordering his 640-acre tract\n\nand the Reid Ranch to the east. The 81-acre tract gave Smith direct access from State Highway\n\n55 to his 640-acre tract. Smith installed a gate to access his property from the state highway.\n\n           Upon noticing the new gate and learning that Smith no longer needed to cross Reid Ranch\n\nto access his property, Lawrence Reid wrote a letter to Smith dated March 11, 2010. The letter\n\ncongratulates Reid on his recent purchase of land and further states:\n\n           Since your new acquisition provides direct access to State of Texas Highway 55, I\n           request we speak soon to discuss your current ingress through our property. We\n           have acted neighborly in the past and wish to continue in such manner, however\n           any necessity of yours to cross our property has now ceased. It is my belief and\n           desire that an acceptable time frame for you to complete your new entrance be\n           reached to accommodate everyone’s needs and wishes.\n\nThe letter was posted on Smith’s gate. 1 Smith did not respond to the letter; at trial, he claimed he\n\nnever received the letter. Having never heard from Smith, in late May 2010, the Reids blocked\n\nthe spur road with a tractor to prevent Smith from using it. Royce was at the house when Smith\n\nattempted to access the road. Royce informed Smith that he no longer needed to use the road.\n\nSmith responded that “he thought he had some type of right to traverse that property.” Smith could\n\nnot explain what right he thought he had, so Royce then moved the tractor and told Smith he had\n\ntwo months to find his proof of access. The Reids left the road unblocked all summer, but Smith\n\nnever contacted the Reids, so the Reids blocked the road again on Labor Day weekend. This time\n\nthey blocked the road with rocks and a gooseneck trailer. Smith still did not contact the Reids.\n\n\n1\n    Royce Reid testified that the letter was posted on the gate “numerous times.”\n\n                                                           -4-\n\f                                                                                            04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n        On November 18, 2010, the Reids filed suit against Smith, asking for a temporary\n\ninjunction and for a declaration that Smith has no right to use the spur road. The Reids were\n\ngranted a temporary restraining order prohibiting Smith from using the spur road across the Reid\n\nRanch. Smith then began exclusively using his property to access the 640-acre tract from State\n\nHighway 55.\n\n        A few months later, Smith approached the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court and\n\nasked the court to declare that the spur road is a county road. On February 8, 2011, the\n\ncommissioners’ court adopted a resolution titled “Smith Road Spur to County Road 330.” The\n\nresolution provides that:\n\n        [T]here is evidence that [the spur road] has been and remains a County Road, to-\n        wit: (1) Resolution of the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court dated June 11,\n        1998 and recorded in Vol. 12, Pg[.] 543 of the Minutes of the Commissioners’\n        Court of Edwards County, Texas, (2) Written statement of Marshall Craig, former\n        Precinct #2 Commission of Edwards County, Texas, recorded April 12, 1978 in\n        Vol[.] 6 at [P]g[.] 29 of the Deed Records of Edwards County, Texas, and (3) verbal\n        statement of Lee Sweeten, current Precinct #2 Commissioner of Edwards County,\n        Texas, that he performed road maintenance work on said spur while employed by\n        the Edwards County Road Department in the mid-1970s[.]\n\nBased on this evidence, the commissioners’ court found and ordered that the spur road “has been\n\nand continues to be a county road for all purposes,” and that the “spur shall hereinafter be included\n\nas part of the county road inventory[.]” However, the resolution concludes that the spur road “shall\n\nnot be added to the official County Road map until such future time as [Transportation Code]\n\nproceedings are completed . . . and adding said spur road to the map is expressly ordered by this\n\nCourt.” The June 11, 1998 minutes reflect that the commissioners passed a motion providing that\n\n“the spur off of road #204 2 that goes to the Moore Ranch has been considered part of the County\n\nroad system . . . and has been historically worked as a county road, therefore, be it resolved that it\n\n\n2\n County Road 330 was previously assigned the number 204; the Reids do not concede, however, that the “Moore\nRanch” mentioned in the 1998 order is the same property as that currently located within the 640-acre tract.\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nis hereby confirmed that it be part of the County Road system and shall remain as such for all\n\npurposes.” There is no evidence that the spur road was subsequently added to the official County\n\nroad map.\n\n       Smith did not inform the Reids or the trial court that he was seeking action from the County\n\nin 2011. He also failed to inform the commissioners that a lawsuit was pending and a temporary\n\nrestraining order had been issued preventing him from using the spur road across the Reid Ranch.\n\nAt trial, County Judge Souli Shanklin testified that the commissioners had no knowledge that the\n\nspur road was the subject of pending litigation, and that had they known, they would not have\n\nadopted the resolution. Shanklin testified that the commissioners’ court learned about the lawsuit\n\nand temporary restraining order immediately after the February 8, 2011 meeting recessed, when\n\nthe sheriff asked Smith “to go out with him to show him what needed to be done, and Smith told\n\nhim that he could not because there was a restraining order against him on that deal.”\n\n       When the Reids learned about the 2011 resolution, they joined Edwards County as a third-\n\nparty defendant in the underlying lawsuit and challenged the validity of the resolution. On May\n\n19, 2012, Edwards County entered into an agreed judgment with the Reids wherein the County\n\nagreed that the February 8, 2011 resolution “was not intended to acquire any public rights in any\n\nroad spur off of County Road 330 as described in the resolution; and to the extent the resolution is\n\nalleged to be an act acquiring or attempting to acquire public rights in the spur under Chapters [sic]\n\n281 or Chapter 258 of the Texas Transportation Code,” the resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. Further, the County agreed that “the Resolution specifically withheld the addition of the\n\nspur as a county road on the County’s Texas Transportation Code Chapter 258 County Road Map.”\n\nFinally, the County agreed that it “made no effort to comply with the notice and other procedures\n\nrequired by Chapters 281 and 258 of the Texas Transportation Code.” By entry of the agreed\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                                  04-13-00550-CV\n\n\njudgment, the Reids nonsuited the County. The County, therefore, did not participate in the\n\nunderlying trial, and stipulated that it would agree to be bound by the trial court’s judgment.\n\n        In May 2011, the Reids amended their petition to add an allegation related to a small, 1.165-\n\nacre piece of land located near the southern boundary of Reid Ranch and the northern boundary of\n\nSmith’s 640-acre tract. The 1.165-acre tract of land has been referred to throughout this litigation\n\nas the “bubble.” The “bubble” contains a natural spring that was fenced in to avoid washouts. The\n\nReids’ new claim alleged prior owners of the two ranches had agreed the “bubble” was a part of\n\nthe Reid Ranch and that future owners would not claim the “bubble” by adverse possession. Smith\n\nfiled an answer asserting the affirmative defenses of easement by estoppel, adverse possession,\n\nand impermissible collateral attack.\n\n        After multiple summary judgment motions were denied, the case proceeded to a bench trial\n\non March 26, 2013. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated on the record that: there is no record access,\n\neasements, or agreements across the Reid tracts in favor of the Smith tracts; and there are no\n\nrecorded dedications, purchases, condemnation, or final judgment of adverse possession in favor\n\nof the public as to any portion of the Reid Ranch as it relates to the spur road. 3 The trial court\n\nheard testimony from multiple witnesses and admitted documentary evidence. Following the\n\nbench trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the Reids, finding that: the spur road is not a public\n\nroad; the spur road is not an easement appurtenant to the Smith tract; the Cloudt Deed creates a\n\ncloud upon the Reids’ title to the sixth and third tracts (i.e., the “bubble”); Smith claimed the\n\nbubble by adverse possession; the claim by Smith to adverse possession of the bubble was a breach\n\nof an express covenant not to so claim the land by adverse possession; and the Reids are entitled\n\nto enforce the terms of the express covenant not to claim the land by adverse possession. The trial\n\n\n3\n The parties further stipulated that Smith abandoned his claim that the spur road is a public road by virtue of the\ndoctrine of implied dedication and his claim of easement by necessity across the Reid property.\n\n                                                       -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\ncourt therefore ordered that the parties are authorized to place boundary fences and that the Reids\n\nare granted a permanent injunction against Smith prohibiting him from utilizing any portion of the\n\nReid Ranch to access the Smith Ranch. The trial court also awarded the Reids court costs and\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $79,171.30 for trial and $20,000 for appeal. The trial court signed\n\ntwo sets of findings of fact conclusions of law in support of its judgment.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n       On appeal, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that the spur road is not\n\na public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3) determining\n\nthat Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees to the Reids.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       In an appeal from a judgment rendered after a bench trial, the trial court’s findings of fact\n\nhave the same weight as a jury’s verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence used to support them, just as we would review a jury’s findings. Catalina v. Blasdel, 881\n\nS.W.2d 295, 297 (Tex. 1994). In conducting a legal sufficiency review, we consider all of the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and indulge every reasonable inference that\n\nwould support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005). In determining\n\nwhether legally sufficient evidence supports the finding under review, we must consider evidence\n\nfavorable to the finding if a reasonable fact finder could consider it, and disregard evidence\n\ncontrary to the finding unless a reasonable factfinder could not disregard it. Id. at 827. When a\n\nparty attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on which it did not have the burden of\n\nproof, it must demonstrate that there is no evidence to support the adverse finding. Croucher v.\n\nCroucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983). We will sustain a legal-sufficiency or “no evidence”\n\nchallenge if the record shows one of the following: (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital\n\nfact, (2) rules of law or evidence bar the court from giving weight to the only evidence offered to\n                                                -8-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nprove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla, or (4)\n\nthe evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at\n\n810.\n\n       In conducting a factual-sufficiency review, we review all of the evidence in a neutral light\n\nand will reverse only if the evidence supporting the finding is so weak or the finding is so against\n\nthe great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong or manifestly unjust.\n\nSee Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). In a bench trial, the trial court\n\nis the sole judge of the witnesses’ credibility, and it may choose to believe one witness over\n\nanother; a reviewing court may not impose its own opinion to the contrary. See Golden Eagle\n\nArchery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).\n\n       We review a trial court’s conclusions of law de novo. BMC Software Belgium, N.V. v.\n\nMarchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex. 2002). Although a trial court’s conclusions of law may not\n\nbe challenged for factual sufficiency, we may review the legal conclusions drawn from the facts\n\nto determine whether the conclusions are correct. Id. If we determine that a conclusion of law is\n\nerroneous, but the trial court nevertheless rendered the proper judgment, the error does not require\n\nreversal. Id.\n\nDeclaration of the spur road as private\n\n       Smith first argues that the trial court erred by declaring the spur road is a private road.\n\nSmith contends the declaration flies in the face of 30 years of official documents, including a 1998\n\norder and a 2011 resolution from the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court, showing that the\n\nspur road is a county road as a matter of law. Smith further argues that the Reids cannot collaterally\n\nattack the commissioners’ actions, such that the 2012 agreed judgment between the Reids and\n\nEdwards County does not nullify the 2011 resolution. The Reids respond that the spur road is not\n\na public road because the County failed to utilize any of the statutorily-authorized methods of\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nacquiring the spur as public, and because the County clarified by way of a November 10, 1986\n\norder that the spur is not a public road by omitting it from its official list of county roads.\n\n       Chapter 281 of the Texas Transportation Code sets out four methods by which a county\n\nwith a population of 50,000 or less, such as Edwards County, may acquire a public interest in a\n\nprivate road. Under section 281.002, a county may acquire a public interest in a private road only\n\nby: (1) purchase; (2) condemnation; (3) dedication; or (4) a court’s final judgment of adverse\n\npossession. See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. § 281.002 (West 2013). A public interest in a private\n\nroad may not be asserted until the commissioners’ court has complied with the resolution\n\nrequirement of section 281.005 and provided written notice to the owner of the road. Id.\n\n§§ 281.005-.006 (West 2013); see also id. § 258.002 (West 2013) (outlining procedures for\n\nadoption of county road map). It is undisputed that Edwards County did not comply with any of\n\nthe statutorily-authorized methods of road creation as it relates to the spur road in either 2011 or\n\n1998. Most notably, the County failed to comply with the notice provisions. Actions by a\n\ncommissioners’ court may be declared void for failure to comply with statutory requirements. See\n\nJohnson v. Krieg, 175 S.W.2d 102, 103-04 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1943, writ ref’d w.o.m.)\n\n(affirming trial court’s finding that commissioners’ court order was void because it was made\n\nwithout notice to landowner). Lawrence Reid testified that, prior to filing the lawsuit at issue,\n\nneither he nor any other member of his family was notified that Edwards County was\n\ncontemplating the status of the road. He further stated that they never received any notice from\n\nthe County with respect to the spur road, meaning that the Reids had no notice of the 1970s\n\ncommissioners’ statements or the 1998 order or the 2011 resolution. Jennifer Reid Smith testified\n\nsimilarly. The trial court was free to consider the evidence that no notice was provided to the\n\nReids before designating the spur road as a county road, as well as the fact that the spur road was\n\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nnever added to the official county road map, 4 in concluding that the spur road is in fact a private\n\nroad.\n\n         In addition, the trial court was free to consider the 2012 agreed judgment memorializing\n\nan agreement between the County and the Reids in which the County disavowed any interest the\n\npublic might have in the spur road and agreed that the 2011 resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. The agreed judgment leaves no doubt that the County did not intend to acquire any\n\npublic rights in the spur road. We also note that the 2011 resolution relied on the 1978 statement\n\nof former commissioner Marshall Craig and the “mid-1970s” verbal statement of current\n\ncommissioner Lee Sweeten in finding that the spur road is a county road. Because individual\n\nmembers of the commissioners’ court have no authority to bind the county by their separate\n\nactions, these statements do not constitute conclusive proof that the spur road is a public road. See\n\nEx parte Conger, 163 Tex. 505, 357 S.W.2d 740, 743 (1962); Canales v. Laughlin, 147 Tex. 169,\n\n214 S.W.2d 451, 455 (1948). The 1998 order similarly does not constitute conclusive proof that\n\nthe spur road was public because, as earlier discussed, the order was made without prior notice to\n\nthe Reids. See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. §§ 281.005-.006 (commissioners’ court must comply\n\nwith resolution requirement of section 281.005 and provide written notice to landowner before\n\nasserting public interest in a private road).\n\n         Finally, we reject Smith’s argument that the 2012 agreed judgment is an impermissible\n\ncollateral attack on an order of the commissioners’ court. See Hanks v. Smith, 74 S.W.3d 409, 412\n\n(Tex. App.—Tyler 2001, pet. denied). 5 A collateral attack is an “attempt to avoid the effect of a\n\n\n4\n  The 2011 resolution specifically provided that the spur road would not be added to the official county road map until\nthe proper statutory requirements were satisfied and “adding said spur to the map is expressly ordered by this Court.”\n5\n  In Hanks, a landowner sought a declaration that a certain road was public despite a commissioners’ court ruling to\nthe contrary. Hanks, 74 S.W.3d at 410-11. The appellate court recited the general rule that “absent a showing of gross\nabuse of discretion, fraud or collusion in the commissioners’ court’s opening of a road, the order of the commissioners’\ncourt is binding and conclusive” and the judgment is not subject to collateral attack. Id. at 412. The appellate court\n\n                                                         - 11 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-13-00550-CV\n\n\njudgment in a proceeding brought for some other purpose. A direct attack on a judgment,\n\nconversely, is an attempt to change that judgment in a proceeding brought for that specific purpose,\n\nsuch as an appeal or a bill of review.” Nw. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Carroll Indep. Sch. Dist., 441\n\nS.W.3d 684, 692 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2014, pet. denied). Because the County was joined in\n\nthe lawsuit filed by the Reids, the 2012 agreed judgment between the County and the Reids cannot\n\nconstitute a collateral attack on the 2011 resolution.\n\n         Mindful of the fact that the fact-finder is the sole judge of the witnesses’ testimony and of\n\nthe weight to be given to their testimony under both a legal and a factual sufficiency review, we\n\nconclude that the evidence presented at trial would allow “reasonable and fair-minded people to\n\nreach the” decision made by the trial court, and that the trial court’s findings regarding the private\n\nnature of the road are not “so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly\n\nwrong and unjust.” City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819, 827; Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176\n\n(Tex. 1986). Accordingly, we overrule Smith’s sufficiency complaint and hold that the evidence\n\npresented at trial was sufficient to support the trial court’s declaration that the spur road is not a\n\npublic road.\n\nEasement by Estoppel\n\n         Smith next argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s denial of an easement by estoppel. The trial court found that:\n\n         The Reids never made any representation of the existence of an easement in favor\n         of Smith or Smith’s property across and over any portion of the Reids’ property or\n         the spur road; and\n\n\ntherefore held that the order of the commissioners’ court reaffirming that the road was a county road was conclusive\nevidence on the issue of the status of the road, and that the trial court therefore erred in finding that the road was\nprivate. Id. The court went on, however, to note that a subsequent order of the commissioners’ court “released all\nclaim” the County had in the road, thereby abandoning the road. Id. Thus, the appellate court ultimately affirmed the\ntrial court’s declaration that the road was private. Id. at 414. To the extent that Smith contends that the Hanks court\nreversed the trial court’s summary judgment, he is mistaken.\n\n\n                                                        - 12 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n         The Reids never made any false or fraudulent statements or representations to\n         Smith regarding access or use of the spur road, or represented to Smith that the\n         Reids had or would dedicate the road to the public, or grant to Smith a private\n         easement.\n\nThree elements are necessary to the creation of an easement by estoppel: 1) a representation\n\ncommunicated, either by word or action, to the promisee; 2) the communication was believed; and\n\n3) the promisee relied on the communication. Storms v. Tuck, 579 S.W.2d 447, 452 (Tex. 1979);\n\nHolden v. Weidenfeller, 929 S.W.2d 124, 131 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996, writ denied). Under\n\nthis doctrine, a landowner may be estopped from denying the existence of an easement created by\n\n“representations” upon which another has detrimentally relied. Drye v. Eagle Rock Ranch, Inc.,\n\n364 S.W.2d 196, 209 (Tex. 1963).\n\n         Smith contends that he proved the elements of easement by estoppel by way of the\n\nfollowing undisputed evidence at trial: Smith, his predecessors in interest, and other landowners\n\nregularly used the spur road without contest by Reid; the spur road was the only way in and out of\n\nthe Smith Ranch due to frequent washouts and floods. Smith leased the 640-acre tract for three\n\nyears before purchasing it from Cloudt, and relied on the unimpeded use of the spur road when\n\ndeciding to purchase the property. Smith made improvements to his land, and relied on use of the\n\nspur road in doing so. He contends that the Reids’ silence regarding the status of the road, and his\n\nreliance on such, constitutes an easement by estoppel. 6\n\n         An easement by estoppel may not be predicated upon silence and passive acquiescence\n\nalone. See Scott v. Cannon, 959 S.W.2d 712, 721 (Tex. App.—Austin 1998, pet. denied) (mere\n\nsilence cannot create an easement by estoppel except where there is a vendor-vendee relationship\n\nbetween the parties); see also Stallman v. Newman, 9 S.W.3d 243, 247 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\n\n\n6\n Smith also argues that the Reids’ affirmative actions in the Bay-Houston litigation (i.e., agreeing to give Bay-Houston\nan easement over the spur road) operated to create an easement by estoppel.\n\n                                                         - 13 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied) (finding that passive acquiescence in and of itself cannot rise to the level\n\nof a “misrepresentation” so as to create an easement by estoppel where there has never been any\n\nunity of title between the two tracts of land). In the absence of a vendor/vendee relationship, there\n\nwas no duty on the Reids to caution or warn Smith or his predecessors-in-title that they should\n\nmake no improvements upon their property without a secure right of ingress and egress\n\nappurtenant to their land. See Roberts v. Allison, 836 S.W.2d 185, 188 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1992,\n\nwrit denied).\n\n       It is undisputed that the Reids never made an affirmative representation to Smith that the\n\nspur road was public, or that an easement existed in favor of Smith. It is further uncontested that\n\nSmith’s use of the road across the Reids’ property was always permissive, up until the time he\n\npurchased the 81-acre tract. The Reids made no misrepresentation, nor did they engage in\n\noverreaching conduct by their silence; they had no duty to speak. See Wilson v. McGuffin, 749\n\nS.W.2d 606, 610-11 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1988, writ denied). Although Smith may have\n\nmade improvements upon his property, the record contains no evidence that he made the\n\nimprovements in reliance on any express promise by the Reids. Further, this case does not involve\n\na landlocked tract, and once Smith purchased the additional acreage in 2010, alternative means of\n\ningress and egress to the Smith property were available without use of the spur road across the\n\nReid Ranch. Accordingly, Smith has failed to establish any of the elements of an easement by\n\nestoppel and we therefore overrule his second issue.\n\nBreach of Covenant Not to Adversely Possess the “Bubble”\n\n       Smith took title to his 640-acre tract subject to a covenant not to claim the Reids’ land by\n\nadverse possession. The Reids’ and Smith’s predecessors in title executed the agreement because\n\nthe terrain of their ranches required the fence-line to deviate from the true boundary line in several\n\nplaces, and neither wanted the deviation to turn into a claim of adverse possession. The Reids’\n                                                - 14 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\npredecessor in title, R.T. Craig, and Smith’s predecessor in title, J.A. Blalack, struck the following\n\nagreement:\n\n       WHEREAS, it was and is the intention of said parties to claim their respective lands\n       according to survey lines and according to the description contained in the several\n       deeds of conveyance under which said parties own and possess said respective\n       lands and not to claim said lands as differently divided by the division fence\n       between said parties as above shown . . . .\n\n       WHEREAS, said parties desire to evidence in writing said arrangement and to show\n       that they did not and do not intend to claim and possess said premises adversely to\n       each other:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That we, R.T.\n       Craig and J.A. Blalack, in consideration of the premises, hereby mutually agree that\n       we do not claim adversely to each other . . . J.A. Blalack for himself likewise\n       contracts and agrees to and with the said R.T. Craig that he, the said J.A. Blalack\n       has not claimed . . . the said portion of the South West one-fourth of Survey 50\n       which is cut into the outside inclosure [of] the said J.A. Blalack and further likewise\n       agrees that he does not and will not claim or assert any interest or title therein but\n       holds said premises subject to the claim and ownership of the said R.T. Craig and\n       the said parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.\n\nThe Reids pleaded that Smith’s deed, which contained a “bubble” of land within their boundary,\n\nconstituted a cloud on their title and constituted a breach of the covenant not to adversely possess.\n\nIn the final judgment, the trial court found that “Smith claimed such ‘bubble’ by virtue of adverse\n\npossession” and that assertion of this claim is “in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so\n\nclaim land . . . by adverse possession.” On appeal, Smith asserts that this finding is not supported\n\nby legally or factually sufficient evidence.\n\n       First, Smith argues that the Reids’ breach of covenant claim is barred by a four-year statute\n\nof limitations. See Malmgren v. Inverness Forest Residents Civic Club, Inc., 981 S.W.2d 875, 877\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (“Actions to enforce restrictive covenants are\n\ncontrolled by the four-year statute of limitations.”). The Reids respond that Smith has waived his\n\naffirmative defense of limitations because he failed to plead or argue it below. Smith’s “Fourth\n\nAmended Original Answer, Counter-Claim and Affirmative Defenses,” contains a section titled\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n“Claims/Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading are two claims/affirmative defenses: (A)\n\nEasement by Estoppel and (B) Adverse Possession. The “adverse possession” heading contains\n\nthe following language:\n\n                 The Defendant, relying on his own deed from D.L. Cloudt in 2003, claims\n         ownership of “the bubble,” which lies at the entrance to the Smith tract, further\n         states that Plaintiffs’ alleged cause of action is barred by limitations set forth in\n         Sections 16.024, 16.025[,] and 16.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n         Code. The deed to Smith dated May 2003 is recorded in Volume 212, Page 821 of\n         the Edwards County deed records.\n\n                Moreover, “the bubble” was conveyed to Smith’s predecessor, Denman L.\n         Cloudt (“Cloudt”) by Deed dated November 16, 1998, recorded at Volume 161,\n         Page 364 of the Edwards County deed records. “The bubble” is described by metes\n         and bounds in the Deed to Cloudt. “The bubble” has been under fence and\n         considered part of what is the Smith Ranch since the 1970’s, prior to both Cloudt\n         and Smith’s ownership.\n\n(Emphasis added). 7 Sections 16.024-.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code pertain\n\nto adverse possession; none of the sections contain a four-year limitations period. See TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 16.024-.026 (West 2002) (providing three, five, and ten-year\n\nlimitations period for adverse possession claims).\n\n         We agree that Smith’s pleadings, which only briefly mention limitations under the adverse\n\npossession heading, failed to put the Reids on notice that he was claiming a limitations defense.\n\nSee TEX. R. CIV. P. 45, 47. A review of Smith’s live pleading would not have provided notice to\n\na reasonably competent attorney of Smith’s intent to assert the affirmative defense of limitations.\n\nSee Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887, 897 (Tex. 2000); Broom v.\n\nBrookshire Bros., Inc., 923 S.W.2d 57, 60 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1995, writ denied). Smith contends\n\nthat absent the Reids’ failure to specially except to his pleading, his pleading is sufficient and he\n\n\n7\n  The pleading also contains a second section titled “Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading, four affirmative\ndefenses are listed as follows: “(A) Estoppel; (B) Estoppel / Silence / Duty to Speak; (C) Adverse Possession; and (D)\nImpermissible Collateral Attack.” There is no mention of the term “limitations” within the discussion of these\naffirmative defenses.\n\n                                                        - 16 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\ndid not waive his affirmative defense of limitations. We disagree that there was any defect in the\n\npleadings calling for special exceptions. See Auld, 34 S.W.3d at 896 (stating an opposing party\n\nshould use special exceptions to identify defects in a pleading so that they may be cured, if\n\npossible, by amendment). The Reids were entitled to rely on Smith’s specific pleading of “adverse\n\npossession,” and were not required to alert Smith to another possible theory of recovery. See\n\nItalian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 S.W.3d 323, 345 (Tex. 2011) (“A\n\nparty is not required to specially except to a pleading defect if it lacks notice of the other party’s\n\nintent.”). Because limitations is an affirmative defense that is waived unless affirmatively pleaded,\n\nSmith has failed to preserve his limitations complaint for our review. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 94; Fed.\n\nDeposit Ins. Corp. v. Lenk, 361 S.W.3d 602, 611 (Tex. 2012).\n\n       Second, Smith contends that he is not bound by the Craig-Blalack agreement and that the\n\nagreement is not tied to the “bubble.” We again disagree. The Craig-Blalock agreement provides\n\nthat the “parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.” Because the\n\noriginal parties to the agreement intended it to be binding upon their heirs and assigns, the covenant\n\nruns with the land. See Inwood N. Homeowners’ Ass’n, Inc. v. Harris, 736 S.W.2d 632, 635 (Tex.\n\n1987) (“In Texas, a covenant runs with the land when it touches and concerns the land; relates to\n\na thing in existence or specifically binds the parties and their assigns; is intended by the original\n\nparties to run with the land; and when the successor to the burden has notice.”); see also Montfort\n\nv. Trek Res., Inc., 198 S.W.3d 344, 355 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2006, no pet.) (intent to run with\n\nthe land may be evidenced by language stating that covenant binds drafters’ “successors and\n\nassigns”). As such, Smith was bound by the covenant not to adversely possess the bubble.\n\n       Third, Smith argues the trial court’s negative finding as to adverse possession precludes a\n\nfinding of breach of covenant. This argument is disingenuous, because the agreement merely\n\nprohibits a “claim” or assertion of interest in the property—it is immaterial that the claim of\n                                                - 17 -\n\f                                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nadverse possession turns out to be unmeritorious or unsuccessful. We therefore cannot agree that\n\nthe trial court erred in finding that Smith claimed the “bubble” by adverse possession and that\n\nassertion of this claim constituted a breach of an express covenant. We overrule Smith’s issue\n\nrelated to breach of the covenant not to adversely possess the “bubble.”\n\nAttorney’s Fees\n\n         Finally, Smith contends we should vacate the award of attorney’s fees. The trial court’s\n\njudgment provides: “Under the discretionary powers of the Court to award attorneys fees under\n\nChapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practices [sic] and Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded\n\nattorneys fees against the Defendant, Randy K. Smith through the trial in the amount of\n\n$79,171.30, and are conditionally awarded attorney fees against Defendant, Randy K. Smith in the\n\nevent that the Defendant Smith appeals this matter to the 4th Court of Appeals in the amount of\n\n$20,000.” Smith claims that although the trial court awarded attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of\n\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, the Reids did not succeed on any Chapter 38 claims.\n\nSee TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001 (West 2008). 8 We disagree. The Reids’ claim\n\nfor breach of the covenant not to adversely possess the “bubble” sounds in contract. See id.\n\n§ 38.001(8); Davis v. Canyon Creek Estates Homeowners Ass’n, 350 S.W.3d 301, 313 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 2011, pet. denied) (“A restrictive covenant is a contract subject to the same\n\nrules of construction and interpretation as any other contract.”); Candlewood Creek Neighborhood\n\nAss’n v.

Feldman, 436 S.W.3d 48, 74-75 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2014, pet. filed) (holding that breach of deed restriction cannot authorize award of\n\nattorney’s fees under Chapter 38). Smith’s reliance on Perez v. Tex. Disposal Sys., Inc., 103\n\nS.W.3d 591, 592 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied), is misplaced because it pertains to\n\nthe recovery of attorney’s fees under section 15.51 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code.\n\nSee TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51 (West 2011) (“Procedures and Remedies in Actions to\n\nEnforce Covenants Not to Compete”). Accordingly, we conclude the award of attorney’s fees\n\nunder Chapter 38 was proper.\n\n       In any event, the trial court was authorized to award attorney’s fees under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act. Section 37.009 of the UDJA provides: “In any proceeding under this\n\nchapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable\n\nand just.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.009 (West 2008). In a declaratory judgment\n\naction, the trial court may award either party costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as are equitable\n\nand just. See Arthur M. Deck & Assocs. v. Crispin, 888 S.W.2d 56, 62 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1994, writ denied). The question, then, is not whether the Reids’ pleadings include a specific\n\nrequest for attorney’s fees under the UDJA, but whether the action between the Reids and Smith\n\nwas one “under this chapter,” i.e., whether it was a declaratory judgment action. It is undisputed\n\nthat the Reids sought declaratory relief against Smith under the UDJA. Thus, the trial court was\n\nauthorized to award attorney’s fees to any party with pleadings requesting them. See Purvis Oil\n\nCorp. v. Hillin, 890 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1994, no writ) (concluding that party\n\nmoving for attorneys’ fees in declaratory judgment action need not specify statutory authority for\n\naward so long as that party has pleaded for attorneys’ fees). The Reids sought recovery of\n\nattorneys’ fees under section 38.001, the UDJA, and under common law.\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to award attorney’s fees under the UDJA for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Ridge Oil Co. v. Guinn Invs., Inc., 148 S.W.3d 143, 163 (Tex. 2004) (citing Bocquet\n\nv. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998)). We employ a hybrid analysis in which the “reasonable\n\nand necessary” requirements are questions of fact determined by the factfinder but the “equitable\n\nand just” requirements are questions of law for the court. Ridge Oil Co., 148 S.W.3d at 161. The\n\nparty seeking to recover attorney’s fees bears the burden of proof. Stewart Title Guar. Co. v.\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991). Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it awarded attorney’s fees to the Reids for trial.\n\n       As to the amount of the attorney’s fees, Smith argues that the Reids should only recover\n\n10% of $87,613.30. Specifically, Smith alleges that evidence was presented that the Reids\n\nincurred a total of $87,613.30 in attorney’s fees at trial, but counsel testified that only 10% of the\n\nfees were incurred in relation to the Smith’s claim of adverse possession of the “bubble.” Again,\n\nwe disagree.    Itemized invoices were presented in support of the entire amount awarded\n\n($79,171.30), and Smith lodged no objection to the evidence at trial. Thus, Smith has waived his\n\nsegregation complaint on appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Green Int’l., Inc. v. Solis, 951\n\nS.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. 1997). Nonetheless, the Reids were entitled to all of their requested fees\n\nbecause the facts underlying their breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims\n\nencompassed 100% of the fees. Counsel testified that he spent 10% of his time on the adverse\n\npossession claim; 30% on the abandoned claims of easement by necessity and public road by\n\nimplied dedication; 30% on the 2011 resolution; and 30% on the temporary restraining order,\n\nrequest for declarations, and defending the easement by estoppel. Accordingly, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in awarding $79,171.30 in attorney’s fees for trial.\n\n       We do, however, agree with Smith that the award of appellate attorney’s fees should have\n\nbeen conditioned on Smith’s unsuccessful appeal to this court. Appellate attorney’s fees must be\n                                                - 20 -\n\f                                                                                   04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nconditioned on success in the appeal. Gilbert v. City of El Paso, 327 S.W.3d 332, 337-38 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2010, no pet.). We therefore modify the judgment to make the award of appellate\n\nattorney’s fees contingent upon an unsuccessful appeal by Smith. See Sundance Minerals, L.P. v.\n\nMoore, 354 S.W.3d 507, 515 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2011, pet. denied). As such, Smith’s final\n\nissue is sustained in part.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        The trial court’s judgment is modified to condition the award of appellate attorney’s fees\n\non an unsuccessful appeal by Smith. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n                                                 Rebeca C.

Such road is a road tract which\n departs from Edwards County Road number 330 in a generally western direction,\n crossing from East to West across the Reid \"Sixth Tract\" being the SE V* of Survey 50\nAbstract 1527, GC &SF Ry Co., and Reid \"Third Tract\", being the S.W. %of Survey 50\nAbstract 2705, GC &SF Ry Co., Edwards County, Texas, and then entering into the\nSmith Tract Survey 49, Abstract 1257 S.P.RyCo., at the point that such road intersects\nwith the boundary line between said Survey 50 and said Survey 49 as such is shown on\nMDS/Boemer Plat attached hereto.\n\n       THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that the spur may have been attempted to be\ndescribed in certain documents received into evidence, specifically being a 1974 letter\nsigned by County Judge Allen Stovall which is recorded at Volume 56, Page 88, Deed\nRecords of Edwards County, Texas, a 1978 statement of Edwards County Commissioner\nMarshall Craig which is recorded at, Volume 56, Page 29, Deed Records of Edwards\nCounty, Texas, June 11, 1998 minutes of Edwards County Commissioners Court which\nare recorded at Volume 12, Page 543, Commissioner Court Records of Edwards County,\nTexas and a January 18, 2011 Resolution of the Edwards County Commissioners Court\nwhich is the subject ofthe earlier judgment of this court in this cause.\n      Chapter 258 allowed a county to clarify its interest in a road by proposing acounty\nroad map which the claims are public through either Chapter 281, or other law, or by\ncontinuous maintenance. The legislature enacted Chapter 258 to help counties to clarify\ntheir public interest in roads in which counties claims existed before the enactment of\n\n\n\n                                              2               /Cf'^lirx '• °'Sa Lycl'a Reves'District Clerl(' Edwards County,Texas, do hereby\n                                                             •Q}?\"' -i&\\ certify that this is atrue and correct copy as appears/of reco/d huny\n                                                            p:4.v >~^||p\\ office.

There is no evidence of Edwards County acquiring public interest in the\n spur by purchase, condemnation, dedication, or aCourt's final judgment or any other law.\n  Nor did the county include the spur on its road map thereby clarifying its status as a\n public road. When a county can only claim public interest in a road by continuous\n maintenance, the county has the burden to prove said continuous maintenance given that\n evidence thereof is primarily within the county's control. \"Continuous maintenance\" is\n defined as grading or other routine road maintenance beginning before September 1,\n 1981, and continuing until the date of protest. Although there is evidence of occasional\n maintenance by the county, there is insufficient evidence of continuous county\n maintenance for the Court to declare a public interest in the spur.                  THE COURT\n FURTHER FINDS that the \"spur road\" is not a public road.\n      THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that there are no access easements appurtenant\nto Smith's Tract Survey 49, Abstract 1257 S.P.RyCo., wherein the Reid \"Sixth Tract-\nbeing the SE %of Survey 50 Abstract 1527, GC &SF Ry Co., Reid \"Third Tract\", being\nthe S.W. %of Survey 50 Abstract 2705, GC &SF Ry Co., Edwards County, Texas, is the\nservient estate; and specifically that the \"spur\" road at issue herein is not an easement\nappurtenant to the Smith Tract Survey 49, Abstract 1257 S.P.Ry.Co.\n      THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that the 2003 Deed from D.L.

Throughout this trial such land burdened by the Deed Without Warranty\n has been described as the \"Bubble\", and is described as a tract of land approximately\n 1.165 acre.\n\n\n       THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that in this suit, Smith claimed such \"bubble\" by\n virtue of adverse possession.\n\n        THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that the claim by Smith to adverse possession of\n the \"bubble\" was in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so claim land in the SW\n%of Survey 50, Abstract 2705 by adverse possession, which covenant originated in a\nagreement between RT Craig and Jay A.

This case, however, presents\n\nthe Court with a complicated set of facts, which, as demonstrated\n\nby the Panel’s Opinion, can easily confuse even the most\n\nexperienced jurist. Smith contends oral argument is warranted to\n\ncut through the confusion and ensure that this Court appreciates\n\nthe legal distinctions arising in this case that make all the\n\ndifference in the outcome of the Opinion. Simply put, Smith is\n\nconfident that a collective discussion regarding the legal issues in\n\nthis case will result in a different outcome. As such, Smith\n\nrespectfully requests this Court hold oral argument before disposing\n\nof this Motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 v\n\f              EN BANC RECONSIDERATION ARGUMENT\n\n        Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 41.2(c) provides that, while\n\nen banc consideration of cases is “disfavored,” it should be ordered\n\nif:\n\n       “necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the\n        court’s decisions,” or\n\n       if “extraordinary circumstances” require.\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 41.2(c). In this case, both situations are presented by\n\nthis case.\n\n        “Unless a court of appeals chooses to hear a case en banc, the\n\ndecision of a panel constitutes the decision of the whole court.”\n\nO’Connor v. First Ct. of Appeals, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788832\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788832/oconnor-v-first-court-of-appeals/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (Tex. 1992). The\n\ncurrent Opinion (attached to this Motion as Tab A) contradicts not\n\nonly this Court’s precedent, but also conflicts with Texas Supreme\n\nCourt precedent regarding the pleading and proof requirements\n\nunderlying the award of attorney’s fees. Texas Rule of Appellate\n\nProcedure 49.7 authorizes this Court to consider en banc a case\n\nthat was previously considered by a panel of this Court. TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 49.7. Smith respectfully requests this Court use the authority\n\nafforded in Rule 49.7 and reconsider this case en banc.\n\n\n                                    1\n\fARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n                     EN BANC\n\n                                     I.\n                                INTRODUCTION\n\n     Although this direct appeal raised numerous complex legal\n\nchallenges to the trial court’s judgment regarding the existence of a\n\npublic road, easements, and adverse possession, this Motion for En\n\nBanc Consideration focuses on only one of the issues raised in the\n\ndirect appeal: the amount of attorney’s fees awarded by the trial\n\ncourt. This Court, in its Panel Opinion, Tab A, affirmed the award.\n\n     This    Court’s   holding,    however,    ignores   the   “narrowing”\n\nlanguage in the trial court’s final judgment. Here is what the\n\nundisputed evidence demonstrates:\n\n        the lawsuit raised numerous causes of actions by both\n\n            parties;\n\n        the parties pleaded for attorney’s fees under some of the\n\n            causes of action;\n\n        the trial court awarded attorney’s fees under only one\n\n            cause of action: breach of contract (Chapter 38) (the trial\n\n            court’s judgment is attached to this Motion as Tab B);\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\f         during the hearing on attorney’s fees, both parties’\n\n          counsel segregated their fees, agreeing that only 10% of\n\n          the fees incurred were for the breach of contract claim\n\n          (approximately $8,000);\n\n         even though it awarded attorney’s fees based on only on\n\n          the breach of contract cause of action, the trial court\n\n          erroneously awarded an amount of attorney’s fees that\n\n          constituted 100% of the attorney’s fees incurred for all\n\n          causes of action (approximately $80,000);\n\n         this Court then mistakenly affirmed that excess award of\n\n          attorney’s fees;\n\nIn affirming the attorney’s fees award, the Panel allowed for the full\n\namount of attorney’s fees by stating that the trial court could have\n\nawarded the full amount of fees based on the cause of action arising\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act (Chapter 37).\n\n     While it would be a different case if the trial court’s judgment\n\nwas silent as the basis of the attorney’s fees award, that is not the\n\ncase before this Court. Here, the trial court specified that it was\n\nawarding fees based only on the breach of contract claim. Tab B.\n\nThe Panel ignored that language. It is true that the trial court could\n                                  3\n\fhave awarded fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act (Chapter\n\n37), but the record shows that the trial court chose not to do so. Tab\n\nB. In essence, this Court chose to rewrite the trial court’s final\n\njudgment   to   include    a   provision   awarding   fees   under   the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act in order to get to its holding. Tab A.\n\n     Even more disturbing, the Panel ignored the agreement of the\n\nparties to offer evidence of their attorney’s fees in a segregated\n\nmanner. Counsel for each side agreed that only 10% of the\n\nattorney’s fees incurred was for the breach of contract claim. Yet,\n\nthe Panel ignored the trial court’s limiting language, as well as the\n\nparties’ agreement, in affirming an award for 100% of the fees.\n\n     The Opinion from the Panel blazes new ground, but in a way\n\nthat is contrary to well established precedent from the Supreme\n\nCourt of Texas. This Court should grant this Motion for En Banc\n\nConsideration to withdraw this erroneous Opinion and remedy the\n\nharm that will be suffered by Smith.\n\n                                  II.\n                          FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n     This direct appeal centered on the status of a road in Edwards\n\nCounty. The road, referred to throughout the record as “Spur\n\n\n                                    4\n\fRoad,” crosses through a small portion of the Reid Ranch (a 1,247-\n\nacre ranch owned by Appellees1) before entering the 640-acre Smith\n\nRanch.2 After a bench trial, the trial court ruled in favor of Reid,3\n\nfinding Spur Road was not a county road, that Spur Road was not\n\nan easement appurtenant to the Smith Ranch, and ordered Smith\n\nto pay nearly $80,000 in attorney’s fees (plus $20,000 in appellate\n\nattorney’s fees). (3CR644).\n\n      Spur Road\n\n      Spur Road (black line in the image below) is a 2/3-mile\n\nroadway that leaves County Road 330, crosses the Reid Ranch from\n\nEast to West, and then enters the Smith Ranch:\n\n\n\n\n1\n Plaintiffs/Appellees are referred to in this Brief collectively as “Reid.” The Reid\nRanch is comprised of Tracts One through Nine. (3CR654). The Reid Ranch\nwas purchased by Royce I. Reid in 1953. (3CR654; 2RR45).\n2Defendant/Appellant is Randy K. Smith, referred to in this Brief as “Smith.”\n\nThe Smith Ranch comprises two tracts, one being 639.192 acres purchased in\n2003 and one being 81.03 acres purchased in 2010. (3CR654-55).\n3Edwards County was joined as a Cross-Defendant as an “interested party”\n\nunder the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act. (2CR464).\n                                         5\n\f(PE1) (yellow: County Road 330; blue: Pulliam Creek; black: Spur\n\nRoad) (2RR23, 48, 50-51, 208-09; 3RR13-14).\n\n        When Spur Road begins (off of County Road 330), there is no\n\ngate, cattle guard, sign, or fence denying the public access to the\n\nroad:\n\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\f(PE10A; 2RR80).\n\n     For as long as anyone can remember, Spur Road has been\n\nutilized by neighboring property owners without protest by Reid or\n\nReid’s predecessors in title.4 Public documents show that the\n\nEdwards County Road Department has been performing road\n\nmaintenance on Spur Road since the mid-1970s. (DE3) (verbal\n\nstatement of Lee Sweeten, current Precinct #2 Commissioner of\n\nEdwards County, Texas, that he performed road maintenance work\n\n\n\n\n(2RR272, 280). The parties stipulated that Spur Road is a spur off County\n4\n\nRoad 330, which has formerly been known as County Road 204. (2RR21).\n                                    7\n\fon said spur while employed by the Edwards County Road\n\nDepartment in the mid-1970s).\n\n     Denman L. Cloudt, who is Smith’s predecessor in title,5 had\n\nalways used Spur Road to access the Smith Ranch during his\n\nownership. (2RR172) (“Oh, yes, we used it. My hunters used it. That\n\nwas the only entrance into the property.”); (2RR180). Cloudt also\n\nstated,     “[l]ater on    we   found        [another entrance] down       here\n\nsomewhere . . . but it’s in — it’s in almost an impossible place to\n\nmaintain. . . . [b]ecause of the flood damage that occurs when you\n\nhave a flood in that country. . . . it’s impossible to build a crossing\n\nat that other place.” (2RR172-73). Cloudt spent over $50,000 on\n\ncrossings over Pulliam Creek and “[t]hey are barely usable now.”\n\n(2RR172, 174).\n\n     The Commissioners Court’s 1998 Order affirming Spur\n     Road as a county road.\n\n     While he still owned the property, Cloudt took steps to ensure\n\nthat Spur Road was officially classified as a county road:\n\n\n\n\n5Cloudt   still owns 423 acres to the east of the Smith Ranch. (2RR176).\n                                         8\n\f(PE17) (Cloudt's affidavit) (cropped).\n\n     In   1998,    the   Edwards       County   Commissioners   Court\n\nunanimously passed a motion to declare:\n\n           [Spur Road] has been considered part of the\n           County road system & whereas, said spur has\n           been historically worked as a county road,\n           therefore, be it resolved that it is hereby\n           confirmed that it is part of the County Road\n           system and shall remain as such for all\n           purposes.\n\n(DE5).\n\n     Smith leases and then buys 640 acres (“the Smith\n     Ranch”) from Cloudt.\n\n     In 2000, Smith leased the 640 acres south of Reid Ranch from\n\nCloudt (this acreage is referred to throughout the litigation as “the\n\nSmith 640” and “the Smith Ranch”). (3CR656; 2RR204; 3RR11).\n\nWhen investigating whether to lease (and then later, whether to\n\n\n                                   9\n\fpurchase) the property, Smith used the Spur Road entrance to the\n\nproperty. (PE1; 2RR23, 48, 50-51, 208-09; 3RR13-14). Spur Road\n\noffered a desirable access point because it ran directly from County\n\nRoad 330 into the campsite located on Smith Ranch. (2RR237) (PE1\n\n[Smith campsite located where black line ends]).\n\n     During Smith’s three-year lease, Reid never objected to\n\nSmith’s use of Spur Road, which traveled right in front of the Reid\n\nhouse, before entering the Smith campsite. (2RR60, 159; 3RR11-\n\n14). Reid also never gave any indication to Smith or others that they\n\nhad no right to travel Spur Road.6 Smith, relying on Reid’s\n\nacquiescence and the free and uninterrupted travel during those\n\nthree years, paid approximately $600,000 to purchase the Smith\n\n640. (PE7; 2RR207-08; 3RR13, 58-59). The deed did not reference\n\n\n\n\n6\n Smith’s predecessors and others owning nearby property often used Spur\nRoad. (2RR58-59, 79) (“[S]o for at least 45 years we know as far as you know\nthat people traveling across your property to the south and to the west\nunimpeded? Yes.”). Evidence also revealed Reid and his foreman had multiple\ncontacts with Smith, even hiring Smith’s children to work on the Reid Ranch,\nbut Reid never once communicated to Smith that he had no right to use Spur\nRoad. (2RR122-23). Seven of Smith’s ten children worked on the Reid Ranch\nfeeding game, cleaning brush, or cleaning houses. (2RR215).\n                                     10\n\fan easement on Spur Road, because, as Cloudt claimed, the road\n\nwas public.7\n\n     After purchasing the ranch, Smith, in reliance on the usability\n\nof the Spur Road entrance, expended vast resources and time\n\nimproving the Smith Ranch. (2RR221-27) (describing multiple\n\nrefurbished trailers, electricity, septic systems, water pump system,\n\nand rain catchment systems); (3RR42-43) (describing improvements\n\nand estimating their cost at $125,000 to $140,000).\n\n     During the entirety of the time Smith and his ten children\n\nlived on Smith Ranch full time, Reid gave no indication to Smith or\n\nothers that Spur Road was a private road. (2RR79-80). Reid\n\nconceded that for “45-plus years [of his lifetime] there’s never been\n\na gate across the road that we’re talking about.” (2RR80). Reid also\n\nconceded no one “ever asked for his permission” to use Spur Road\n\nand that he has never “told anyone that they needed [his]\n\npermission to use the road.” (2RR81-82).\n\n     Use of Spur Road to access Smith Ranch is integral to Smith’s\n\nuse and enjoyment of the property. Where County Road 330 (yellow\n\n7\n (3RR47). Cloudt testified the documents do not mention an easement because\nEdwards County had already designated Spur Road as a county road.\n(2RR199). Cloudt told Smith, “That [Spur Road] is your access.” (2RR240).\n                                    11\n\fline) meets Spur Road (black line), there is a crossing over Pulliam\n\nCreek (blue line). (PE1; 2RR114). This creek crossing has washed\n\nout hundreds of times and been repaired by Edwards County for\n\nthe benefit of Reid and others using Spur Road. (2RR114). Over 600\n\nof Smith’s acreage is located across Pulliam Creek. (2RR115;\n\n3RR21). Reid acknowledged that if Smith is denied use of Spur\n\nRoad (whose crossing is maintained by Edwards County), Smith will\n\nhave to construct and maintain his own private crossing over\n\nPulliam Creek to access the 600 acres of his property on the other\n\nside of Pulliam Creek. (2RR116).\n\n     Smith purchases 80 more acres from Cloudt, triggering\n     Reid to contest Smith’s use of Spur Road to enter Smith\n     Ranch.\n\n     In 2010, Smith purchased another 80 acres from Cloudt that\n\nadjoined the Smith 640. (3CR657; 3RR58-59).\n\n\n\n\n                                   12\n\f(PE1). This newly-acquired tract abuts Highway 55. (3CR657).\n\n     After Reid learned that Smith had purchased the 80 acres with\n\nHighway 55 frontage, Reid began blocking Smith’s access to Spur\n\nRoad. (2RR60, 63, 110; PE11 [letter from Reid to Smith]). First,\n\nSmith arrived to find his gate to the 640 acres locked. (3RR18-19)\n\n(“There was a lock and I was really stunned, so I cut the lock and\n\nproceeded in. Then at some point we had some encounter and they\n\nverbally — I think it was Royce that expressed that we didn’t have a\n\nright to come through here, and I was rather stunned, to be honest\n\nwith you, because I thought all those matters had already been\n                                 13\n\fsettled with the Bay-Houston suit.”). Then, Reid placed tractors and\n\nboulders across Spur Road to block Smith’s entrance and exit via\n\nthe Spur Road access gate.8\n\n     Reid contends Smith should use the entrance to the property\n\nlocated off Highway 55 (the entrance that came with the newly-\n\npurchased 80 acres), but Smith testified to the impossibility of\n\nusing the Highway 55 entrance. (2RR216; 3RR21-26). To utilize this\n\nentrance, Smith is forced to leave the vehicles parked on the side of\n\nthe Highway 55 entrance and then have someone on the property\n\ncome pick them up with an all-terrain vehicle. (2RR230-31).\n\n     The Underlying Lawsuit\n\n     In 2010, Reid filed suit against Smith. (1CR8). Reid asked for a\n\ntemporary injunction and for a declaration that Smith has no right\n\nto use Spur Road. (1CR9-10). Reid was granted the temporary\n\ninjunction. (1CR38). Smith then answered the lawsuit with a\n\ngeneral denial. (1CR41).\n\n     The 2011 Resolution reaffirming Spur Road as a county\n     road.\n\n\n\n(3RR20). Since Smith’s purchase of the 80 acres, Reid has also stated Smith\n8\n\ndoes not have permission to cross from County Road 330, over the 20 feet of\nReid Ranch, to access Smith’s 80-acre tract. (2RR120).\n                                    14\n\f     After he got sued, Smith began looking for the public records\n\nrelated to Spur Road. (3RR61-62). Smith asked the Edwards\n\nCounty Commissioners to review the public documents and clarify\n\nthat Spur Road was a public road. (3RR62; DE4 [recounting that\n\nSmith testified before the Commissioners]). At a 2011 Meeting,\n\nCommissioner Sweeten moved that the Commissioners Court adopt\n\na resolution affirming Spur Road is a designated county road.\n\n(DE4). The Commissioners voted 4-0 to adopt the resolution. (DE4).\n\n     The Resolution provides:\n\n\n\n\n(DE3) (cropped).\n\n     The 2011 Resolution goes on to describe the evidence\n\nconsidered by the Commissioners:\n\n\n\n\n(DE3) (cropped).\n\n\n                                15\n\f      Finally, the 2011 Resolution goes on to note that Spur Road\n\nwas “inadvertently omitted” from the County Road Map and:\n\n\n\n\n(DE3) (cropped).\n\n      Reid adds a suit to remove a cloud on his title related to\n      the “bubble.”\n\n      In May 2011, Reid amended his petition to add an allegation\n\nrelated to a small, 1.165-acre piece of land located near the\n\nsouthern boundary of Reid Ranch and the northern boundary of the\n\nSmith 640. (PE2; 1CR46). This 1.165-acre piece has been referred\n\nto throughout this litigation as the “bubble.” The “bubble” contains\n\na natural spring that had been fenced around to avoid washouts.\n\n(2RR69-70, 74, 209-10, 213; 3RR37-38, 63). Reid’s new claim\n\nalleged prior owners of the two ranches had agreed the bubble was\n\na part of the Reid Ranch and that future owners would not claim\n\nthe bubble by adverse possession. (1CR46-47). Smith answered this\n\nnew   claim   by   asserting   a   limitations   defense   and   adverse\n\npossession. (3CR527).\n\n                                   16\n\f     The Bench Trial and Judgment\n\n     The trial court heard testimony from multiple witnesses and\n\nadmitted documentary evidence. (2RR-3RR [testimony]; 4RR [Reid’s\n\nexhibits]; 5RR [Smith’s exhibits]). The trial court’s final judgment\n\nprovides:\n\n   “There is no evidence of Edwards County acquiring public\n\n     interest in the spur by purchase, condemnation, dedication, or\n\n     a Court’s final judgment or any other law. Nor did the county\n\n     include the spur on its road map thereby clarifying its status\n\n     as a public road.”\n\n   “[T]he ‘spur road’ is not a public road.”\n\n   “[T]here are no access easements appurtenant . . . and\n\n     specifically that the ‘spur’ road at issue herein is not an\n\n     easement appurtenant.”\n\n   “[T]he 2003 Deed from D.L. Cloudt, Sr. to Randy K Smith . . .\n\n     creates a cloud upon the ‘Reid’ title. . . Throughout this trial\n\n     such land has been described as the ‘Bubble.’”\n\n   “Smith claimed such ‘bubble’ by virtue of adverse possession. .\n\n     . [T]he claim by Smith to adverse possession of the ‘bubble’\n\n     was in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so claim\n                                 17\n\f     land . . . by adverse possession, which covenant originated in\n\n     a agreement between RT Craig and Jay A. Blalock dated July\n\n     27, 1937.”\n\n   “Reid is entitled to enforce the terms of said express covenant\n\n     not to so claim land by adverse possession.”\n\n   “The Plaintiffs are granted a permanent injunction against\n\n     Defendant Randy K. Smith, his agents and employees,\n\n     prohibiting them from utilizing any portion of the Reid Ranch\n\n     to access the Smith property or any portion thereof.”\n\n   “Under the discretionary powers of the Court to award\n\n     attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice\n\n     and Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded attorney’s fees\n\n     against the Defendant, Randy K. Smith through the trial in the\n\n     amount of $79,171.30 and are conditionally awarded attorney\n\n     fees against Defendant Randy K. Smith in the event that the\n\n     Defendant Smith appeals this matter to the 4th Court of\n\n     Appeals in the amount of $20,000.”\n\n(3CR638-42). Smith timely filed his notice of appeal to this Court.\n\n(3CR703). The Panel then issued an Opinion affirming the\n\n\n\n                                 18\n\fjudgment in all respects other than to make the award of attorney’s\n\nfees on appeal contingent.\n\n                                      III.\n                THE ATTORNEY’S FEES AWARD MUST BE VACATED\n\n        The Panel erred by affirming the award of excess attorney’s\n\nfees.    This    Court   should    grant     this   Motion    for   En   Banc\n\nReconsideration, withdraw the Panel’s Opinion, and issue a new\n\nOpinion either vacating the award of attorney’s fees altogether or, at\n\na minimum, modifying the award to remove the excess amount from\n\nthe attorney’s fees award. Here is how the award of attorney’s fees\n\nwas erroneous:\n\n        Reid asked for attorney’s fees under multiple theories: (1) to\n\nremove the cloud on his title (related to the “Bubble”);9 (2) under\n\n“TRCP 38.001,” which is for breach of contract claims, (2CR474); (3)\n\nunder “the Declaratory Judgments Act,” (2CR474); and (4) “under\n\ncommon law.”10\n\n\n9\n (2CR467).

As noted earlier, Reid asked for attorney’s fees for his suit to\n\nremove cloud on title,11 Chapter 37 (Texas’s Declaratory Judgment\n\nAct), Chapter 38, and “common law.” (2CR467, 474). Reid did not\n\nplead for attorney’s fees under Section 5.006, which allows a party\n\nwho succeeds in a breach of covenant claim to recover attorney’s\n\nfees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 5.006.\n\n      The trial court’s findings of fact provide: The agreement\n\nbetween RT Craig and Jay A.

However, the request for attorney’s fees contained\nwithin this section of the petition provides: Smith’s solicitation and recordation\nof the instrument from Cloudt to Smith and Smith’s continued claim of the\nright of possession of such property creates a cloud on Reid’s title to such\nlands, and accordingly, Reid requests that the court remove such clouding\n(Cloudt) instruments from Reid’s chain of title. In that respect, the Plaintiffs\nask for the award of attorney’s fees necessary to remove such cloud on, and to\nclarify the entire boundary between Section 49 and 50, plus costs of court,\nsuch amounts being in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of the\nCourt. (2CR466). The request for attorney’s fees found at the end of Reid’s\npetition references only Chapter 38, “the Declaratory Judgment Act,” and\n“common law” as authorizing an award of attorney’s fees to him. (2CR474).\n                                       22\n\fexpress covenant by Smith’s predecessors in title Not to Claim Land\n\nby Adverse Possession. (3CR660). Smith, in asserting a claim for\n\nadverse possession to land, breached such express covenant, and in\n\nso breaching, Smith is liable for attorney’s fees and costs under\n\nsection 38.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n(3CR660).\n\n     The trial court’s conclusion that Smith’s purported breach of\n\nthe express covenant renders him liable for attorney’s fees under\n\nChapter 38 is erroneous. Compare TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 38.001 (creating liability for attorney’s fees for, inter alia,\n\nsuccessful breach of contract), with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 5.006 (creating liability for attorney’s fees for successful\n\nbreach of covenant claim). Accordingly, this Court should reverse\n\nand vacate the award of attorney’s fees against Smith.\n\n     Moreover, even if this Court disregards the fact that the trial\n\ncourt conditioned its attorney’s fees award on Chapter 38, the Panel\n\nwas wrong in “rewriting” the judgment based on the trial court’s\n\nfindings of fact related to the purported breach of express covenant.\n\nReid is limited to the theories of attorney’s fees pleaded, and he\n\ncannot now be awarded attorney’s fees based on the unpleaded\n\n                                 23\n\fSection 5.006 theory.

Reid did not dispute this\n\nevidence in his briefing or oral argument.\n\n     Reid’s attorney also testified to the trial court that the\n\nremaining 90% of Reid’s fees were incurred for unrelated legal\n\nissues, some of which were abandoned before trial. (3RR94) (30% of\n\nthe time was spent on claims that were abandoned; 30% of the time\n\nwas spent on defending against the 2011 County Road Resolution;\n\n30% of the time was spent on “our affirmative claims . . . the\n\nrequest for the TRO, the request for declarations, the boundary,\n\ndefending the easement by estoppel and defending against the legal\n\neffect of the court-related items that were admitted a few minutes\n\nago, the '78 statement and the '98 actions of the commissioners\n\n                                 25\n\fcourt”).\n\n      As argued earlier, Reid neither pleaded nor succeeded on a\n\nChapter 38-based claim and Reid failed to plead for attorney’s fees\n\nunder Section 5.006, thus, the judgment for attorney’s fees should\n\nbe reversed and vacated.

Smith appeals the trial court’s judgment enjoining him from using a road located\n\non property owned by Lawrence Reid, Royce H. Reid, Jennifer Heath, and THL GP, Inc.\n\n(collectively, the Reids). In four issues, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that\n\nthe road is not a public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3)\n\ndetermining that Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees. We\n\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to condition the award of appellate attorney’s fees on an\n\nunsuccessful appeal by Smith. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\f                                                                                     04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n                                            BACKGROUND\n\n            The Reids are the owners of approximately 1,231.6-acres of real property located in\n\nEdwards County known as the Reid Ranch. The Reid Ranch consists of nine tracts of land. The\n\nReids trace their ownership of the ranch to Royce I. Reid, who acquired the ranch by General\n\nWarranty Deed dated May 14, 1953. The May 14, 1953 Warranty Deed does not contain any\n\nexception for any easement benefiting adjoining property.\n\n            Smith owns 720.222 acres of land adjoining the Reid Ranch (“Smith Ranch”). The Smith\n\nRanch includes two tracts: a 639.192-acre tract and an 81.03-acre tract (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe 640-acre tract and the 81-acre tract). Smith acquired the 640-acre tract from Denman L. Cloudt\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated May 8, 2003 (“Cloudt Deed”). The 81-acre tract was acquired\n\nby General Warranty Deed dated February 19, 2010. Neither Warranty Deed contains reference\n\nto conveyance of an easement or other appurtenant right over and across any portion of the Reid\n\nRanch.\n\n            Edwards County Road 330 originates at a point of intersection with State Highway 55 on\n\nthe southeastern boundary of Reid Ranch. County Road 330 traverses Reid Ranch. There is a\n\nroad known as “the spur road” which departs from Edwards County Road 330 in a generally\n\nwesterly direction crossing from east to west across portions of the Reid Ranch. Specifically, the\n\nspur road crosses the sixth tract and the third tract of the Reid Ranch. The spur road then enters\n\ninto the Smith Ranch at a point such that it intersects the boundary line between the Reid Ranch\n\nand the Smith Ranch. For a number of years, the Reids permitted Smith and his predecessors in\n\ntitle to use the spur road to conveniently access his 640-acre tract. The following map was admitted\n\nat trial:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n\n\n(The thick black line is the spur road; the yellow line is County Road 330; and the blue line is\n\nPulliam Creek).\n\n       Bay-Houston Towing Co. owned property south of the Smith Ranch. In 2007, Bay-\n\nHouston sued Smith in an attempt to establish the right to use the spur road to travel across Smith’s\n\nproperty. Because Bay-Houston also had to use a portion of the Reid Ranch to reach its property,\n\nSmith asked for leave of court to join the Reids in the litigation, and pointed out that both the Reids\n\nand “Edwards County officials . . . contest and dispute that this roadway over the Reid Ranch is a\n\npublic highway.” In their answer to Smith’s Third Party Petition, the Reids denied “that all or any\n\nportion of the roadway in question is a public road.” To avoid litigation, the Reids entered into a\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nRule 11 agreement with Bay-Houston providing that they would give Bay-Houston permission to\n\nuse the spur road across Reid Ranch if Bay-Houston won its suit against Smith. Smith then non-\n\nsuited his third party claim against the Reids. Bay-Houston lost at trial and was not allowed to use\n\nthe spur road across Smith’s property, thus rendering the Rule 11 agreement moot.\n\n           In February 2010, Smith purchased an additional 81-acre tract bordering his 640-acre tract\n\nand the Reid Ranch to the east. The 81-acre tract gave Smith direct access from State Highway\n\n55 to his 640-acre tract. Smith installed a gate to access his property from the state highway.\n\n           Upon noticing the new gate and learning that Smith no longer needed to cross Reid Ranch\n\nto access his property, Lawrence Reid wrote a letter to Smith dated March 11, 2010. The letter\n\ncongratulates Reid on his recent purchase of land and further states:\n\n           Since your new acquisition provides direct access to State of Texas Highway 55, I\n           request we speak soon to discuss your current ingress through our property. We\n           have acted neighborly in the past and wish to continue in such manner, however\n           any necessity of yours to cross our property has now ceased. It is my belief and\n           desire that an acceptable time frame for you to complete your new entrance be\n           reached to accommodate everyone’s needs and wishes.\n\nThe letter was posted on Smith’s gate. 1 Smith did not respond to the letter; at trial, he claimed he\n\nnever received the letter. Having never heard from Smith, in late May 2010, the Reids blocked\n\nthe spur road with a tractor to prevent Smith from using it. Royce was at the house when Smith\n\nattempted to access the road. Royce informed Smith that he no longer needed to use the road.\n\nSmith responded that “he thought he had some type of right to traverse that property.” Smith could\n\nnot explain what right he thought he had, so Royce then moved the tractor and told Smith he had\n\ntwo months to find his proof of access. The Reids left the road unblocked all summer, but Smith\n\nnever contacted the Reids, so the Reids blocked the road again on Labor Day weekend. This time\n\nthey blocked the road with rocks and a gooseneck trailer. Smith still did not contact the Reids.\n\n\n1\n    Royce Reid testified that the letter was posted on the gate “numerous times.”\n\n                                                           -4-\n\f                                                                                            04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n        On November 18, 2010, the Reids filed suit against Smith, asking for a temporary\n\ninjunction and for a declaration that Smith has no right to use the spur road. The Reids were\n\ngranted a temporary restraining order prohibiting Smith from using the spur road across the Reid\n\nRanch. Smith then began exclusively using his property to access the 640-acre tract from State\n\nHighway 55.\n\n        A few months later, Smith approached the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court and\n\nasked the court to declare that the spur road is a county road. On February 8, 2011, the\n\ncommissioners’ court adopted a resolution titled “Smith Road Spur to County Road 330.” The\n\nresolution provides that:\n\n        [T]here is evidence that [the spur road] has been and remains a County Road, to-\n        wit: (1) Resolution of the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court dated June 11,\n        1998 and recorded in Vol. 12, Pg[.] 543 of the Minutes of the Commissioners’\n        Court of Edwards County, Texas, (2) Written statement of Marshall Craig, former\n        Precinct #2 Commission of Edwards County, Texas, recorded April 12, 1978 in\n        Vol[.] 6 at [P]g[.] 29 of the Deed Records of Edwards County, Texas, and (3) verbal\n        statement of Lee Sweeten, current Precinct #2 Commissioner of Edwards County,\n        Texas, that he performed road maintenance work on said spur while employed by\n        the Edwards County Road Department in the mid-1970s[.]\n\nBased on this evidence, the commissioners’ court found and ordered that the spur road “has been\n\nand continues to be a county road for all purposes,” and that the “spur shall hereinafter be included\n\nas part of the county road inventory[.]” However, the resolution concludes that the spur road “shall\n\nnot be added to the official County Road map until such future time as [Transportation Code]\n\nproceedings are completed . . . and adding said spur road to the map is expressly ordered by this\n\nCourt.” The June 11, 1998 minutes reflect that the commissioners passed a motion providing that\n\n“the spur off of road #204 2 that goes to the Moore Ranch has been considered part of the County\n\nroad system . . . and has been historically worked as a county road, therefore, be it resolved that it\n\n\n2\n County Road 330 was previously assigned the number 204; the Reids do not concede, however, that the “Moore\nRanch” mentioned in the 1998 order is the same property as that currently located within the 640-acre tract.\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nis hereby confirmed that it be part of the County Road system and shall remain as such for all\n\npurposes.” There is no evidence that the spur road was subsequently added to the official County\n\nroad map.\n\n       Smith did not inform the Reids or the trial court that he was seeking action from the County\n\nin 2011. He also failed to inform the commissioners that a lawsuit was pending and a temporary\n\nrestraining order had been issued preventing him from using the spur road across the Reid Ranch.\n\nAt trial, County Judge Souli Shanklin testified that the commissioners had no knowledge that the\n\nspur road was the subject of pending litigation, and that had they known, they would not have\n\nadopted the resolution. Shanklin testified that the commissioners’ court learned about the lawsuit\n\nand temporary restraining order immediately after the February 8, 2011 meeting recessed, when\n\nthe sheriff asked Smith “to go out with him to show him what needed to be done, and Smith told\n\nhim that he could not because there was a restraining order against him on that deal.”\n\n       When the Reids learned about the 2011 resolution, they joined Edwards County as a third-\n\nparty defendant in the underlying lawsuit and challenged the validity of the resolution. On May\n\n19, 2012, Edwards County entered into an agreed judgment with the Reids wherein the County\n\nagreed that the February 8, 2011 resolution “was not intended to acquire any public rights in any\n\nroad spur off of County Road 330 as described in the resolution; and to the extent the resolution is\n\nalleged to be an act acquiring or attempting to acquire public rights in the spur under Chapters [sic]\n\n281 or Chapter 258 of the Texas Transportation Code,” the resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. Further, the County agreed that “the Resolution specifically withheld the addition of the\n\nspur as a county road on the County’s Texas Transportation Code Chapter 258 County Road Map.”\n\nFinally, the County agreed that it “made no effort to comply with the notice and other procedures\n\nrequired by Chapters 281 and 258 of the Texas Transportation Code.” By entry of the agreed\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                                  04-13-00550-CV\n\n\njudgment, the Reids nonsuited the County. The County, therefore, did not participate in the\n\nunderlying trial, and stipulated that it would agree to be bound by the trial court’s judgment.\n\n        In May 2011, the Reids amended their petition to add an allegation related to a small, 1.165-\n\nacre piece of land located near the southern boundary of Reid Ranch and the northern boundary of\n\nSmith’s 640-acre tract. The 1.165-acre tract of land has been referred to throughout this litigation\n\nas the “bubble.” The “bubble” contains a natural spring that was fenced in to avoid washouts. The\n\nReids’ new claim alleged prior owners of the two ranches had agreed the “bubble” was a part of\n\nthe Reid Ranch and that future owners would not claim the “bubble” by adverse possession. Smith\n\nfiled an answer asserting the affirmative defenses of easement by estoppel, adverse possession,\n\nand impermissible collateral attack.\n\n        After multiple summary judgment motions were denied, the case proceeded to a bench trial\n\non March 26, 2013. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated on the record that: there is no record access,\n\neasements, or agreements across the Reid tracts in favor of the Smith tracts; and there are no\n\nrecorded dedications, purchases, condemnation, or final judgment of adverse possession in favor\n\nof the public as to any portion of the Reid Ranch as it relates to the spur road. 3 The trial court\n\nheard testimony from multiple witnesses and admitted documentary evidence. Following the\n\nbench trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the Reids, finding that: the spur road is not a public\n\nroad; the spur road is not an easement appurtenant to the Smith tract; the Cloudt Deed creates a\n\ncloud upon the Reids’ title to the sixth and third tracts (i.e., the “bubble”); Smith claimed the\n\nbubble by adverse possession; the claim by Smith to adverse possession of the bubble was a breach\n\nof an express covenant not to so claim the land by adverse possession; and the Reids are entitled\n\nto enforce the terms of the express covenant not to claim the land by adverse possession. The trial\n\n\n3\n The parties further stipulated that Smith abandoned his claim that the spur road is a public road by virtue of the\ndoctrine of implied dedication and his claim of easement by necessity across the Reid property.\n\n                                                       -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\ncourt therefore ordered that the parties are authorized to place boundary fences and that the Reids\n\nare granted a permanent injunction against Smith prohibiting him from utilizing any portion of the\n\nReid Ranch to access the Smith Ranch. The trial court also awarded the Reids court costs and\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $79,171.30 for trial and $20,000 for appeal. The trial court signed\n\ntwo sets of findings of fact conclusions of law in support of its judgment.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n       On appeal, Smith argues that the trial court erred in: (1) declaring that the spur road is not\n\na public road; (2) determining that Smith did not have an easement by estoppel; (3) determining\n\nthat Smith is liable for breach of covenant; and (4) awarding attorney’s fees to the Reids.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       In an appeal from a judgment rendered after a bench trial, the trial court’s findings of fact\n\nhave the same weight as a jury’s verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence used to support them, just as we would review a jury’s findings.

Id.\n\nDeclaration of the spur road as private\n\n       Smith first argues that the trial court erred by declaring the spur road is a private road.\n\nSmith contends the declaration flies in the face of 30 years of official documents, including a 1998\n\norder and a 2011 resolution from the Edwards County Commissioners’ Court, showing that the\n\nspur road is a county road as a matter of law. Smith further argues that the Reids cannot collaterally\n\nattack the commissioners’ actions, such that the 2012 agreed judgment between the Reids and\n\nEdwards County does not nullify the 2011 resolution. The Reids respond that the spur road is not\n\na public road because the County failed to utilize any of the statutorily-authorized methods of\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nacquiring the spur as public, and because the County clarified by way of a November 10, 1986\n\norder that the spur is not a public road by omitting it from its official list of county roads.\n\n       Chapter 281 of the Texas Transportation Code sets out four methods by which a county\n\nwith a population of 50,000 or less, such as Edwards County, may acquire a public interest in a\n\nprivate road. Under section 281.002, a county may acquire a public interest in a private road only\n\nby: (1) purchase; (2) condemnation; (3) dedication; or (4) a court’s final judgment of adverse\n\npossession. See TEX. TRANSP. CODE ANN. § 281.002 (West 2013). A public interest in a private\n\nroad may not be asserted until the commissioners’ court has complied with the resolution\n\nrequirement of section 281.005 and provided written notice to the owner of the road. Id.\n\n§§ 281.005-.006 (West 2013); see also id. § 258.002 (West 2013) (outlining procedures for\n\nadoption of county road map). It is undisputed that Edwards County did not comply with any of\n\nthe statutorily-authorized methods of road creation as it relates to the spur road in either 2011 or\n\n1998. Most notably, the County failed to comply with the notice provisions. Actions by a\n\ncommissioners’ court may be declared void for failure to comply with statutory requirements. See\n\nJohnson v. Krieg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3914608\"><a href=\"/opinion/4150139/johnson-v-krieg/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103-04 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1943, writ ref’d w.o.m.)\n\n(affirming trial court’s finding that commissioners’ court order was void because it was made\n\nwithout notice to landowner). Lawrence Reid testified that, prior to filing the lawsuit at issue,\n\nneither he nor any other member of his family was notified that Edwards County was\n\ncontemplating the status of the road. He further stated that they never received any notice from\n\nthe County with respect to the spur road, meaning that the Reids had no notice of the 1970s\n\ncommissioners’ statements or the 1998 order or the 2011 resolution. Jennifer Reid Smith testified\n\nsimilarly. The trial court was free to consider the evidence that no notice was provided to the\n\nReids before designating the spur road as a county road, as well as the fact that the spur road was\n\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nnever added to the official county road map, 4 in concluding that the spur road is in fact a private\n\nroad.\n\n         In addition, the trial court was free to consider the 2012 agreed judgment memorializing\n\nan agreement between the County and the Reids in which the County disavowed any interest the\n\npublic might have in the spur road and agreed that the 2011 resolution is invalid, unenforceable,\n\nand void. The agreed judgment leaves no doubt that the County did not intend to acquire any\n\npublic rights in the spur road. We also note that the 2011 resolution relied on the 1978 statement\n\nof former commissioner Marshall Craig and the “mid-1970s” verbal statement of current\n\ncommissioner Lee Sweeten in finding that the spur road is a county road. Because individual\n\nmembers of the commissioners’ court have no authority to bind the county by their separate\n\nactions, these statements do not constitute conclusive proof that the spur road is a public road.

Accordingly, we overrule Smith’s sufficiency complaint and hold that the evidence\n\npresented at trial was sufficient to support the trial court’s declaration that the spur road is not a\n\npublic road.\n\nEasement by Estoppel\n\n         Smith next argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s denial of an easement by estoppel. The trial court found that:\n\n         The Reids never made any representation of the existence of an easement in favor\n         of Smith or Smith’s property across and over any portion of the Reids’ property or\n         the spur road; and\n\n\ntherefore held that the order of the commissioners’ court reaffirming that the road was a county road was conclusive\nevidence on the issue of the status of the road, and that the trial court therefore erred in finding that the road was\nprivate. Id. The court went on, however, to note that a subsequent order of the commissioners’ court “released all\nclaim” the County had in the road, thereby abandoning the road. Id. Thus, the appellate court ultimately affirmed the\ntrial court’s declaration that the road was private. Id. at 414. To the extent that Smith contends that the Hanks court\nreversed the trial court’s summary judgment, he is mistaken.\n\n\n                                                        - 12 -\n\f                                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n         The Reids never made any false or fraudulent statements or representations to\n         Smith regarding access or use of the spur road, or represented to Smith that the\n         Reids had or would dedicate the road to the public, or grant to Smith a private\n         easement.\n\nThree elements are necessary to the creation of an easement by estoppel: 1) a representation\n\ncommunicated, either by word or action, to the promisee; 2) the communication was believed; and\n\n3) the promisee relied on the communication.

Allison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1653429\"><a href=\"/opinion/1653429/roberts-v-allison/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1992,\n\nwrit denied).\n\n       It is undisputed that the Reids never made an affirmative representation to Smith that the\n\nspur road was public, or that an easement existed in favor of Smith. It is further uncontested that\n\nSmith’s use of the road across the Reids’ property was always permissive, up until the time he\n\npurchased the 81-acre tract. The Reids made no misrepresentation, nor did they engage in\n\noverreaching conduct by their silence; they had no duty to speak. See Wilson v. McGuffin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2468479\"><a href=\"/opinion/2468479/wilson-v-mcguffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610-11 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1988, writ denied). Although Smith may have\n\nmade improvements upon his property, the record contains no evidence that he made the\n\nimprovements in reliance on any express promise by the Reids. Further, this case does not involve\n\na landlocked tract, and once Smith purchased the additional acreage in 2010, alternative means of\n\ningress and egress to the Smith property were available without use of the spur road across the\n\nReid Ranch. Accordingly, Smith has failed to establish any of the elements of an easement by\n\nestoppel and we therefore overrule his second issue.\n\nBreach of Covenant Not to Adversely Possess the “Bubble”\n\n       Smith took title to his 640-acre tract subject to a covenant not to claim the Reids’ land by\n\nadverse possession. The Reids’ and Smith’s predecessors in title executed the agreement because\n\nthe terrain of their ranches required the fence-line to deviate from the true boundary line in several\n\nplaces, and neither wanted the deviation to turn into a claim of adverse possession. The Reids’\n                                                - 14 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\npredecessor in title, R.T. Craig, and Smith’s predecessor in title, J.A. Blalack, struck the following\n\nagreement:\n\n       WHEREAS, it was and is the intention of said parties to claim their respective lands\n       according to survey lines and according to the description contained in the several\n       deeds of conveyance under which said parties own and possess said respective\n       lands and not to claim said lands as differently divided by the division fence\n       between said parties as above shown . . . .\n\n       WHEREAS, said parties desire to evidence in writing said arrangement and to show\n       that they did not and do not intend to claim and possess said premises adversely to\n       each other:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That we, R.T.\n       Craig and J.A. Blalack, in consideration of the premises, hereby mutually agree that\n       we do not claim adversely to each other . . . J.A. Blalack for himself likewise\n       contracts and agrees to and with the said R.T. Craig that he, the said J.A. Blalack\n       has not claimed . . . the said portion of the South West one-fourth of Survey 50\n       which is cut into the outside inclosure [of] the said J.A. Blalack and further likewise\n       agrees that he does not and will not claim or assert any interest or title therein but\n       holds said premises subject to the claim and ownership of the said R.T. Craig and\n       the said parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.\n\nThe Reids pleaded that Smith’s deed, which contained a “bubble” of land within their boundary,\n\nconstituted a cloud on their title and constituted a breach of the covenant not to adversely possess.\n\nIn the final judgment, the trial court found that “Smith claimed such ‘bubble’ by virtue of adverse\n\npossession” and that assertion of this claim is “in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so\n\nclaim land . . . by adverse possession.” On appeal, Smith asserts that this finding is not supported\n\nby legally or factually sufficient evidence.\n\n       First, Smith argues that the Reids’ breach of covenant claim is barred by a four-year statute\n\nof limitations. See Malmgren v. Inverness Forest Residents Civic Club, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1759855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1759855/malmgren-v-inverness-forest-residents-civic-club-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (“Actions to enforce restrictive covenants are\n\ncontrolled by the four-year statute of limitations.”). The Reids respond that Smith has waived his\n\naffirmative defense of limitations because he failed to plead or argue it below. Smith’s “Fourth\n\nAmended Original Answer, Counter-Claim and Affirmative Defenses,” contains a section titled\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                                    04-13-00550-CV\n\n\n“Claims/Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading are two claims/affirmative defenses: (A)\n\nEasement by Estoppel and (B) Adverse Possession. The “adverse possession” heading contains\n\nthe following language:\n\n                 The Defendant, relying on his own deed from D.L. Cloudt in 2003, claims\n         ownership of “the bubble,” which lies at the entrance to the Smith tract, further\n         states that Plaintiffs’ alleged cause of action is barred by limitations set forth in\n         Sections 16.024, 16.025[,] and 16.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n         Code. The deed to Smith dated May 2003 is recorded in Volume 212, Page 821 of\n         the Edwards County deed records.\n\n                Moreover, “the bubble” was conveyed to Smith’s predecessor, Denman L.\n         Cloudt (“Cloudt”) by Deed dated November 16, 1998, recorded at Volume 161,\n         Page 364 of the Edwards County deed records. “The bubble” is described by metes\n         and bounds in the Deed to Cloudt. “The bubble” has been under fence and\n         considered part of what is the Smith Ranch since the 1970’s, prior to both Cloudt\n         and Smith’s ownership.\n\n(Emphasis added). 7 Sections 16.024-.026 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code pertain\n\nto adverse possession; none of the sections contain a four-year limitations period. See TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 16.024-.026 (West 2002) (providing three, five, and ten-year\n\nlimitations period for adverse possession claims).\n\n         We agree that Smith’s pleadings, which only briefly mention limitations under the adverse\n\npossession heading, failed to put the Reids on notice that he was claiming a limitations defense.\n\nSee TEX. R. CIV. P. 45, 47.

Smith contends\n\nthat absent the Reids’ failure to specially except to his pleading, his pleading is sufficient and he\n\n\n7\n  The pleading also contains a second section titled “Affirmative Defenses.” Under this heading, four affirmative\ndefenses are listed as follows: “(A) Estoppel; (B) Estoppel / Silence / Duty to Speak; (C) Adverse Possession; and (D)\nImpermissible Collateral Attack.” There is no mention of the term “limitations” within the discussion of these\naffirmative defenses.\n\n                                                        - 16 -\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00550-CV\n\n\ndid not waive his affirmative defense of limitations. We disagree that there was any defect in the\n\npleadings calling for special exceptions. See Auld, 34 S.W.3d at 896 (stating an opposing party\n\nshould use special exceptions to identify defects in a pleading so that they may be cured, if\n\npossible, by amendment). The Reids were entitled to rely on Smith’s specific pleading of “adverse\n\npossession,” and were not required to alert Smith to another possible theory of recovery. See\n\nItalian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins.

Because limitations is an affirmative defense that is waived unless affirmatively pleaded,\n\nSmith has failed to preserve his limitations complaint for our review. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 94; Fed.\n\nDeposit Ins. Corp. v.

The Craig-Blalock agreement provides\n\nthat the “parties agree that this contract is binding upon their heirs and assigns.” Because the\n\noriginal parties to the agreement intended it to be binding upon their heirs and assigns, the covenant\n\nruns with the land. See Inwood N. Homeowners’ Ass’n, Inc. v.

App.—Eastland 2006, no pet.) (intent to run with\n\nthe land may be evidenced by language stating that covenant binds drafters’ “successors and\n\nassigns”). As such, Smith was bound by the covenant not to adversely possess the bubble.\n\n       Third, Smith argues the trial court’s negative finding as to adverse possession precludes a\n\nfinding of breach of covenant. This argument is disingenuous, because the agreement merely\n\nprohibits a “claim” or assertion of interest in the property—it is immaterial that the claim of\n                                                - 17 -\n\f                                                                                                        04-13-00550-CV\n\n\nadverse possession turns out to be unmeritorious or unsuccessful. We therefore cannot agree that\n\nthe trial court erred in finding that Smith claimed the “bubble” by adverse possession and that\n\nassertion of this claim constituted a breach of an express covenant. We overrule Smith’s issue\n\nrelated to breach of the covenant not to adversely possess the “bubble.”\n\nAttorney’s Fees\n\n         Finally, Smith contends we should vacate the award of attorney’s fees. The trial court’s\n\njudgment provides: “Under the discretionary powers of the Court to award attorneys fees under\n\nChapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practices [sic] and Remedies Code, the Plaintiffs are awarded\n\nattorneys fees against the Defendant, Randy K. Smith through the trial in the amount of\n\n$79,171.30, and are conditionally awarded attorney fees against Defendant, Randy K. Smith in the\n\nevent that the Defendant Smith appeals this matter to the 4th Court of Appeals in the amount of\n\n$20,000.” Smith claims that although the trial court awarded attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of\n\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, the Reids did not succeed on any Chapter 38 claims.\n\nSee TEX.

The question, then, is not whether the Reids’ pleadings include a specific\n\nrequest for attorney’s fees under the UDJA, but whether the action between the Reids and Smith\n\nwas one “under this chapter,” i.e., whether it was a declaratory judgment action. It is undisputed\n\nthat the Reids sought declaratory relief against Smith under the UDJA. Thus, the trial court was\n\nauthorized to award attorney’s fees to any party with pleadings requesting them. See Purvis Oil\n\nCorp. v.

Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it awarded attorney’s fees to the Reids for trial.\n\n       As to the amount of the attorney’s fees, Smith argues that the Reids should only recover\n\n10% of $87,613.30. Specifically, Smith alleges that evidence was presented that the Reids\n\nincurred a total of $87,613.30 in attorney’s fees at trial, but counsel testified that only 10% of the\n\nfees were incurred in relation to the Smith’s claim of adverse possession of the “bubble.” Again,\n\nwe disagree.    Itemized invoices were presented in support of the entire amount awarded\n\n($79,171.30), and Smith lodged no objection to the evidence at trial. Thus, Smith has waived his\n\nsegregation complaint on appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Green Int’l., Inc. v.

Nonetheless, the Reids were entitled to all of their requested fees\n\nbecause the facts underlying their breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims\n\nencompassed 100% of the fees. Counsel testified that he spent 10% of his time on the adverse\n\npossession claim; 30% on the abandoned claims of easement by necessity and public road by\n\nimplied dedication; 30% on the 2011 resolution; and 30% on the temporary restraining order,\n\nrequest for declarations, and defending the easement by estoppel. Accordingly, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in awarding $79,171.30 in attorney’s fees for trial.\n\n       We do, however, agree with Smith that the award of appellate attorney’s fees should have\n\nbeen conditioned on Smith’s unsuccessful appeal to this court.

Plaintiffs, Lawrence Reid, Royce Reid, Jennifer Heath and THL GP, Inc.\n (collectively referred hereto as \"Reid\") appeared in person and by and through their\n attorney of record, Joe M. Davis and Defendant, Randy K. Smith (\"Smith\") appeared in\nperson and by and through his attorneys of record, J. Ken Nunley and Chad M. Upham,\nand Idwards County appeared personally through its County Judge Souli Shanklin and\n by and through its attorney of record Chad Elkins and announced ready for trial. The jury\nwas waived and all questions offact were submitted to the Court.\n        Before trial, Edwards County announced to the Court that while it was a Defendant\nin the case it wished to waive its right to participate and be present during the trial.\nEdwards County stipulated to the Court that it would agree to be bound by the Judgment\nof this Court following a trial on the merits. All parties stipulated their agreement to allow\nEdwards County to be excused from participation at trial.\n       The Court determined that it had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of\nthis case.\n\n\n       The Court having considered the evidence, arguments of counsel and credibility of\nthe witnesses finds as follows:\n                                                                 •(J?-*.

Such road is a road tract which\n departs from Edwards County Road number 330 in a generally western direction,\n crossing from East to West across the Reid \"Sixth Tract\" being the SE V* of Survey 50\nAbstract 1527, GC &SF Ry Co., and Reid \"Third Tract\", being the S.W. %of Survey 50\nAbstract 2705, GC &SF Ry Co., Edwards County, Texas, and then entering into the\nSmith Tract Survey 49, Abstract 1257 S.P.RyCo., at the point that such road intersects\nwith the boundary line between said Survey 50 and said Survey 49 as such is shown on\nMDS/Boemer Plat attached hereto.\n\n       THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that the spur may have been attempted to be\ndescribed in certain documents received into evidence, specifically being a 1974 letter\nsigned by County Judge Allen Stovall which is recorded at Volume 56, Page 88, Deed\nRecords of Edwards County, Texas, a 1978 statement of Edwards County Commissioner\nMarshall Craig which is recorded at, Volume 56, Page 29, Deed Records of Edwards\nCounty, Texas, June 11, 1998 minutes of Edwards County Commissioners Court which\nare recorded at Volume 12, Page 543, Commissioner Court Records of Edwards County,\nTexas and a January 18, 2011 Resolution of the Edwards County Commissioners Court\nwhich is the subject ofthe earlier judgment of this court in this cause.\n      Chapter 258 allowed a county to clarify its interest in a road by proposing acounty\nroad map which the claims are public through either Chapter 281, or other law, or by\ncontinuous maintenance. The legislature enacted Chapter 258 to help counties to clarify\ntheir public interest in roads in which counties claims existed before the enactment of\n\n\n\n                                              2               /Cf'^lirx '• °'Sa Lycl'a Reves'District Clerl(' Edwards County,Texas, do hereby\n                                                             •Q}?\"' -i&\\ certify that this is atrue and correct copy as appears/of reco/d huny\n                                                            p:4.v >~^||p\\ office.

There is no evidence of Edwards County acquiring public interest in the\n spur by purchase, condemnation, dedication, or aCourt's final judgment or any other law.\n  Nor did the county include the spur on its road map thereby clarifying its status as a\n public road. When a county can only claim public interest in a road by continuous\n maintenance, the county has the burden to prove said continuous maintenance given that\n evidence thereof is primarily within the county's control. \"Continuous maintenance\" is\n defined as grading or other routine road maintenance beginning before September 1,\n 1981, and continuing until the date of protest. Although there is evidence of occasional\n maintenance by the county, there is insufficient evidence of continuous county\n maintenance for the Court to declare a public interest in the spur.                  THE COURT\n FURTHER FINDS that the \"spur road\" is not a public road.\n      THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that there are no access easements appurtenant\nto Smith's Tract Survey 49, Abstract 1257 S.P.RyCo., wherein the Reid \"Sixth Tract-\nbeing the SE %of Survey 50 Abstract 1527, GC &SF Ry Co., Reid \"Third Tract\", being\nthe S.W. %of Survey 50 Abstract 2705, GC &SF Ry Co., Edwards County, Texas, is the\nservient estate; and specifically that the \"spur\" road at issue herein is not an easement\nappurtenant to the Smith Tract Survey 49, Abstract 1257 S.P.Ry.Co.\n      THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that the 2003 Deed from D.L. Cloudt, Sr. to\nRandy KSmith which is recorded at Volume 212, Page 821, of the Official Public Records\nof Edwards County Texas creates acloud upon the \"Reid\" title to the \"Sixth Tract\" being\nthe SE %of Survey 50 Abstract 1527, GC &SF Ry Co., and the Reid \"Third Tract\", being\nthe S.W.

Throughout this trial such land burdened by the Deed Without Warranty\n has been described as the \"Bubble\", and is described as a tract of land approximately\n 1.165 acre.\n\n\n       THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that in this suit, Smith claimed such \"bubble\" by\n virtue of adverse possession.\n\n        THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that the claim by Smith to adverse possession of\n the \"bubble\" was in fact a breach of an express covenant not to so claim land in the SW\n%of Survey 50, Abstract 2705 by adverse possession, which covenant originated in a\nagreement between RT Craig and Jay A. Blaiock dated July 27, 1937, and which is\nrecorded at Volume 31 page 563 of the Deed Records of Edwards County, Texas. Said\nagreement was incorporated by reference into the deed from D.L. Cloudt, Sr. to Randy K.\nSmith, which deed was recorded at Volume 212, Page 821 of the Official Public Records\nof Edwards County.\n\n       THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that as the record owners of SW %of Survey 50,\nAbstract 2705, Reid is entitled to enforce the terms of said express covenant not to so\nclaim land by adverse possession.\n\n      It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:\n      That the boundary between the Smith Tract, Survey 49, Abstract 1257,\nS.P.Ry.Co., and the Reid Reid \"Sixth Tract\" being the SE %of Survey 50 Abstract 1527,\n\n\n                                                                  I, Olga Lydia Reyes, District Clerk, Edwards County, Texas, do hereby\n                                                                  certify that this is atrue and correct copy as appejysyof recard kmy\n                                                                  office.
