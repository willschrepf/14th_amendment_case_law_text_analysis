See Hutchinson v. United States, 838 F.2d 390, 392 (9th Cir.1988).   Summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues as to any material fact.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).   There is no genuine issue of material fact when the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party.   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).   The nonmoving party must produce some evidence or specific facts to rebut the factual allegations and evidence in the motion for summary judgment.

Appellant argues that state laws and regulations create a substantive due process right to a hearing in such circumstances.   Appellant has litigated this issue in at least one prior action and lost.   See Turner v. Shimoda, 936 F.2d 580 (9th Cir.1991) (Table, Text in Westlaw) (appellant had no constitutional right to a hearing upon placement in administrative segregation;  state regulations conferred no such liberty interest).   Consequently, appellant's claim is barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   See Robi v.

The magistrate-judge properly rejected these claims, noting that appellant has no constitutional right to correctional or rehabilitative programming,  Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1255 n. 8 (9th Cir.1982), that appellant failed to state a constitutional violation for lack of library access,  Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), and that appellant's equal protection rights were not violated because he was not similarly situated to inmates in the general population.   Similarly, appellant's claim regarding denial of legal materials was properly rejected for failure to allege or demonstrate any actual injury.   Sands v. Lewis, 886 F.2d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's Eighth Amendment claim for denial of adequate psychiatric care while in segregation was properly rejected because appellant's bald and unsubstantiated allegations failed to demonstrate the existence of any serious medical need, let alone any deliberate indifference to such need on the part of prison officials.   Estelle v.
