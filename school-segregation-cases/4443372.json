R. APP. P. 39.7, the State only requests oral argument if this\n\nCourt deems it necessary.

The indictment alleges appellant intentionally killed Adam while in the\n\ncourse of committing kidnapping on September 30, 1992. (CR 2-3; RR XVII 17-18).\n\nTEX.

After Arturo lost his job, he began\n\nselling drugs out of their apartment to support the family. (RR XVIII 127-128, 197-\n\n199). When Diana found out, she was unhappy, but ended up helping him since he\n\ncould not find work. (RR XVIII 128, 198).\n\n      Appellant supplied the drugs to Arturo and Diana; they knew him as\n\n“Chico.” (RR XVIII 128-129, 141, 167, 172, 177, 199-201; RR XX 84, 93; State’s\n\nExhibit Number 83). They also knew one of his associates, Carmelo Martinez\n\nSantana, who went by the name “Rudy.” (RR XVIII 138, 142; RR XX 85; RR XXI\n\n39; State’s Exhibit Number 85). The family knew both of them very well, and\n\nDiana even leased an apartment for appellant and his wife Angelita because they\n\nhad credit issues. (RR XVIII 135-138, 201-202; RR XIX 11; RR XX 93-94; State’s\n\nExhibit Number 42). Although they were close friends, Diana and others noted\n\nthat appellant was a strong person, the leader of the drug operation and everyone\n\nin the group took direction from him. (RR XVIII 138-139; RR XIX 152-155; RR XX\n\n123). Two to three weeks prior to the offense, Diana and Arturo decided to stop\n\nselling drugs for appellant, and he was not happy about it. (RR XVIII 133-134,\n\n203-204).\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      On the evening of September 30, 1992, shortly before midnight, the couple\n\nwas awakened to a loud noise; the front door of their apartment was kicked in.\n\n(RR XVIII 47-48, 69, 149, 206-207; RR XIX 58; State’s Exhibit Number 11). Arturo\n\ngot out of bed and encountered a tall masked man holding a gun. (RR XVIII 149-\n\n151, 208-209; RR XIX 34). This man gave them both instructions; he forced Diana\n\non the bed and tied up Arturo with the alarm clock cord. (RR XVIII 74, 77, 152-\n\n153, 158-160, 210-212). He repeatedly kicked Arturo and hit him over the head with\n\nthe handgun until he was knocked unconscious. (RR XVIII 153-158, 212-213; RR\n\nXIX 77).\n\n      A second gunman entered the room, tied up Diana and sexually assaulted\n\nher. (RR XVIII 78, 157-158, 210, 212, 214). Diana testified she knew the assailant\n\nejaculated because she felt a substance between her legs. (RR XVIII 165). Adam\n\nwas lying on a pallet on the floor and Diana heard him crying while she was being\n\nraped and Arturo was being assaulted. (RR XVIII 146, 155, 158). After the sexual\n\nassault, the two men ransacked the bedroom and left the apartment. (RR XVIII\n\n160-162; State’s Exhibit Numbers 20, 23, 24, 27 & 28). Soon after, Diana realized\n\nAdam was no longer in the apartment and went outside; her neighbor called the\n\npolice to report the sexual assault and kidnapping. (RR XVIII 163-164).\n\n      The couple needed immediate medical attention; Arturo suffered injuries to\n\nthe back of his head and Diana went to the hospital for a sexual assault exam. (RR\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fXVIII 51-52, 89, 163, 165, 217; RR XIX 57). SANE nurse Gloria Kologinczok\n\nperformed a sexual assault examination of Diana at 3:45 a.m. on October 1, 1992 at\n\nSt. Joseph’s Hospital in Houston. (RR XIX 41-50; State’s Exhibit Number 33). At\n\n4:25 a.m., she turned over the evidence collection kit, which included panties,\n\nvaginal swabs, a known saliva sample and a known blood sample, to HPD Officer\n\nBredemeyer. (RR XIX 49-50, 58-59; State’s Exhibit Numbers 33A, 33B, 33C &\n\n33D). Bredemeyer maintained custody of the evidence and transported it to the\n\nHPD property room. (RR XIX 59-60). A cigar found in the apartment that did not\n\nbelong to Diana or Arturo was collected as evidence. (RR XVIII 80-82).\n\n      Diana was unable to give a description of the second man who raped her, as\n\nshe did not see his face or hear his voice. (RR XVIII 162). But she described the\n\nfirst man, the tall one who assaulted her husband. (RR XVIII 98-99, 101-102). She\n\nrecalled he had a dark complexion and spoke in the Spanish language, but with a\n\nforeign accent, not a Hispanic accent that one would hear in Mexico. (RR XVIII\n\n99, 152). Arturo described it as a Central American accent. (RR XVIII 211).\n\n      Police learned from neighbors that Diana and Arturo had recently been\n\nselling drugs out of their apartment. (RR XVIII 56). Believing this was crucial to\n\nthe investigation of Adam’s kidnapping, Officer Hernandez interviewed both\n\nDiana and Arturo. (RR XIX 65-67). They initially denied being involved with\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fdrugs, but later admitted their involvement and told authorities appellant was\n\ntheir drug supplier. (RR XVIII 166-167, 199, 218; RR XIX 65-75).\n\n      The FBI initially suspected appellant in the abduction of Adam, but learned\n\nhe fled the country soon after the offense. (RR XIX 135-139, 144-145; XX 98-100).\n\nWhen appellant’s wife Angelita learned about Adam’s abduction on the news, she\n\nwas shocked. (RR XX 96). She recalled appellant did not have an appropriate\n\nreaction and then abruptly informed her he was going to Puerto Rico. (RR XX 96-\n\n100, 102-103).\n\n      HPD Sergeant Swaim went to appellant’s apartment on October 6, 1992.\n\n(RR XIX 184-185). At the apartment, Swaim encountered a Hispanic man who\n\nidentified himself as Candido Lebron. (RR XIX 185-186; State’s Exhibit Number\n\n84). Swaim interviewed him, but doubted his identity because the man could not\n\nprovide the name of his parents that were listed on the birth certificate he\n\nprovided. (RR XIX 186). Swaim later learned the man’s true identity was Rogelio\n\nAviles-Barroso, appellant’s co-defendant in this case. (RR XIX 186-187; RR XX\n\n130-131; RR XXI 88-89; State’s Exhibit Number 84).\n\n      More than a month after the abduction, on November 5, 1992, the body of a\n\nyoung boy was found in Baytown. (RR XVIII 91-92, 218-219; RR XIX 191-192; RR\n\nXXI 86). Dental records confirmed the identity as Adam and the manner of death\n\nwas ruled a homicide. (RR XVIII 92; RR XIX 205; XX 4-15, 24-25). Although his\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fremains were skeletal by that time, Adam was still wearing the Batman pajamas he\n\nhad gone to bed in on September 30, 1992. (RR XVIII 92, 168-169; RR XIX 193-194,\n\n202-204; State’s Exhibit Numbers 48, 51 & 61).\n\n      Approximately one month after Adam’s body was found, Angelita\n\nRodriguez traveled to Puerto Rico. (RR XX 105). While there, she met with\n\nappellant and told him she wanted a divorce. (RR XX 105-106). Appellant told\n\nAngelita he would not agree to a divorce and threated to harm her family. (RR XX\n\n106-107).   Angelita asked appellant if he had anything to do with Adam’s\n\ndisappearance and appellant admitted he killed Adam. (RR XX 107).\n\n      Several years passed and the case went unsolved. In 2007, as part of a cold\n\ncase investigation, HPD Sergeant Mehl reviewed the case file and located\n\nappellant in Puerto Rico. (RR XX 37-43, 49). A sample of appellant’s DNA was\n\nobtained and compared to the sexual assault kit and cigar left at the crime scene;\n\nanalysis revealed appellant was the man who raped Diana in 1992. (RR XX 44-52,\n\n55, 72-78; RR XXI 92-93, 105-107, 109, 117-120, 156-157, 160-162, 168; State’s Exhibit\n\nNumbers 32, 33, 65, 66, 68, 76, 77 & 95).\n\n      When the case was re-opened, FBI Special Agent Eric Johnson located\n\nCarmelo Martinez Santana in a Pennsylvania prison. (RR XX 165-166, 176-178).\n\nAt the time of this trial, Santana was serving time on two federal convictions for\n\ndrug trafficking and weapons possession. (RR XX 118-119; RR XXI 18-19, 29-30).\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fWhen he interviewed Santana, FBI Special Agent William Ebersole gathered\n\nsignificantly more information than was previously known about Adam’s murder.\n\n(RR XX 175-183; RR XXI 11-14, 65-77).\n\n      Santana is Angelita’s cousin and moved from the Dominican Republic to\n\nPuerto Rico, and then to the United States in 1992 with Angelita and appellant.\n\n(RR XX 117-120). Santana came to the U.S. with appellant to work in the drug\n\nbusiness with him, selling cocaine. (RR XX 120-123). He was known to the\n\nparties in appellant’s drug ring as “Rudy.” (RR XX 116). Santana described\n\nappellant as a violent, controlling leader; one who was protective of his drug\n\nbusiness and became angry when his people wanted out of the business. (RR XX\n\n123-127). Santana testified appellant had once tied him up and threatened to kill\n\nhim when he thought Santana was taking drug clients from him. (RR XX 124).\n\n      Santana recalled on September 30, 1992, appellant wanted to go to Diana’s\n\napartment to look for drugs and money, so he and Aviles-Barroso accompanied\n\nappellant. (RR XX 135-137). Santana remained in the car while appellant and\n\nAviles-Barroso went inside the apartment. (RR XX 137-138). Both appellant and\n\nAviles-Barroso were wearing ski masks and possessed weapons; Santana recalled\n\nappellant had a gun and Aviles-Barroso had a knife. (RR XX 137-142; RR XXI 52).\n\n      Santana estimated they were in the apartment for approximately 30\n\nminutes. (RR XX 143). When they returned, Santana was surprised to see\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\fappellant holding a little boy in his arms. (RR XX 143-144). Santana immediately\n\nasked appellant why he had taken Adam and appellant replied that the child had\n\nseen his face and recognized him. (RR XX 144; State’s Exhibit Number 31).\n\nSantana was unsuccessful in trying to convince appellant to take Adam back\n\ninside to his mother. (RR XX 145-147). Appellant then admitted to Santana that\n\nhe raped Diana. (RR XX 145).\n\n      Appellant put Adam in the backseat of the vehicle and drove the group to\n\nBaytown. (RR XX 147-149). He stopped in a secluded area and they all got out of\n\nthe vehicle; appellant stated to Aviles-Barroso, “You already know what you have\n\nto do.” (RR XX 149-150; RR XXI 60). Santana immediately felt nauseous and\n\nbecame ill; he walked away from them and defecated in the woods. (RR XX 150;\n\nRR XXI 9). During this time, appellant followed Santana to see what he was\n\ndoing and Santana heard Adam scream and moan. (RR XX 150-151, 160). When\n\nSantana returned to the vehicle, he saw that Adam was dead and covered in blood\n\nthroughout his torso. (RR XX 151-152; RR XXI 10).\n\n      Appellant ordered Santana and Aviles-Barroso to put the body back into the\n\nvehicle and they obeyed. (RR XX 152). Appellant drove them to a rural area and\n\ninstructed them to throw the body in a nearby river. (RR XX 152-153). He further\n\ninstructed them to sink the child, so Santana and Aviles-Barroso gathered some\n\nrocks and placed them on top of the body. (RR XX 153-154).\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\f       Afterward, when they were driving back toward Pasadena, they had several\n\nflat tires.   (RR XX 154-155).    They called a friend Charlie for help with\n\ntransportation and appellant made Santana and Aviles-Barroso swear they would\n\nnever tell anyone what happened. (RR XIX 156-161, 172; RR XX 156; RR XXI 44,\n\n61). Charlie would not come get them, so they took a taxi to Charlie’s house to\n\nborrow a vehicle. (RR XIX 161-166; RR XX 156-157). Charlie’s girlfriend, Linda\n\nHernandez, recalled that Santana seemed extremely nervous. (RR XIX 163; RR\n\nXX 157). Appellant instructed Santana to get rid of the knife and told Santana he\n\nwas leaving town because of what he did that night. (RR XX 158-159, 166).\n\n       The following day, appellant changed the tires on his vehicle, washed out\n\nthe blood and sold it. (RR XX 160-162). Appellant used the money he got from\n\nthe car sale to buy a plane ticket out of the country. (RR XX 162). Santana took\n\nappellant to the airport and never saw him again. (RR XX 162, 164).\n\n       16 years after Adam’s death, capital murder charges were filed against\n\nappellant and Rogelio Aviles-Barroso. (RR XX 55-56; RR XXI 91). After the jury\n\nfound appellant guilty of capital murder, they heard evidence that appellant\n\ncommitted multiple other violent crimes, demonstrating he is a continuing threat\n\nto society. (CR 506, 523).\n\n       Carmelo Martinez Santana testified during the punishment phase to shed\n\nlight on appellant’s actions prior to Adam’s murder. (RR XXV 59-89). Santana\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\fdescribed appellant’s behavior when appellant believed Santana was stealing his\n\nmoney and drug customers. Appellant tied him up, threw him in a bathtub,\n\ngagged him and threatened to kill him, until Santana gave him money and\n\npromised never to betray him. (RR XXV 61-64).\n\n      Santana relayed another incident where appellant sought retribution\n\nagainst a drug competitor, a man named Patiko. (RR XXV 65-71). In a distinctly\n\nsimilar manner to the charged offense, appellant, Santana and another man broke\n\ninto Patiko’s apartment. (RR XXV 66-69). Santana waited in the car while\n\nappellant and the other man went inside to burglarize the apartment. (RR XXV\n\n69). When they returned 20 minutes later, they were carrying drugs and money.\n\n(RR XXV 69-70). Appellant told Santana that he had tied up and beaten Patiko\n\nand then raped his girlfriend. (RR XXV 70-71). Santana recalled when he spent\n\ntime with appellant, they frequently burglarized people in the drug business. (RR\n\nXXV 71).\n\n      In July of 1989, appellant kidnapped and killed a drug associate named Saul\n\nFlores. (RR XXV 22-33, 72-85, 99, 121; State’s Exhibit Number 122). Appellant\n\nlearned that Saul was interested in his girlfriend, Elizabeth Ramos, and became\n\ninfuriated. (RR XXV 49-50, 74-75). Appellant, Santana and a man named Robert\n\nwent over to Elizabeth’s apartment where they found Saul. (RR XXV 75-76).\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\fThey grabbed him, put him in their car and transported him to a drug apartment\n\non Winkler where they sold drugs. (RR XXV 76-77).\n\n      Appellant tied up Saul and began beating him. (RR XXV 79). Appellant\n\nrepeatedly hit Saul with a hammer and injected him with drugs. (RR XXV 80-81,\n\n93-94). Santana saw appellant get on top of Saul and apply pressure to his neck\n\nuntil he died. (RR XXV 81-82). Appellant instructed Santana to help him put\n\nSaul’s body in the bathtub and they left the apartment. (RR XXV 82-83).\n\n      Tina Perez, a friend of Elizabeth’s, went over to the apartment on Winkler\n\nlooking to buy some drugs. (RR XXV 24-30). The door was open, but no one was\n\nthere; she went inside and saw Saul’s body in the bathtub. (RR XXV 30-33).\n\nWhen appellant learned the police wanted to question Tina about Saul, he told\n\nher to keep quiet, and tell the police she had not seen anything. (RR XXV 32-35).\n\n      Soon after, appellant returned to the apartment with his drug associates and\n\nthey carried Saul’s body to the dumpster. (RR XXV 7-19, 84-85). An autopsy\n\nrevealed Saul had suffered multiple blunt force traumas, had cocaine in his blood\n\nand had been restrained and strangulated. (RR XXV 97-111).\n\n      In October of 2001, while in Puerto Rico, appellant attempted to kill a\n\nrestaurant business owner and kidnapped two men. (RR XXIV 14-42). Appellant\n\npointed a revolver at Manuel Buten and attempted to shoot him two times, but\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fluckily the gun did not fire and Buten was able to run away. (RR XXIV 23-25, 82-\n\n83, 102).\n\n      Buten later learned appellant had kidnapped two family members who\n\nworked at the restaurant, his brother Andres Buten and his step-son William\n\nMartinez, who was only 16. (RR XXIV 18, 20, 26, 83-97, 99, 102-106). Appellant\n\ncalled Buten and demanded a large amount of cocaine and cash in exchange for the\n\nsafe release of the two men. (RR XXIV 29-32, 47). Appellant threatened to kill\n\nthem if Buten called the police or failed to comply with his demands. (RR XXIV\n\n31, 37). With the assistance of law enforcement, Buten negotiated with appellant\n\nand he was apprehended. (RR XXIV 41, 48-58).\n\n      Agent Rodriguez convinced appellant to let the men go; while in custody\n\nappellant called his wife and instructed her to release Andres and William. (RR\n\nXXIV 58-60). Both of the men had been severely injured and were taken to the\n\nhospital. (RR XXIV 60, 95-96, 105-111).\n\n      Andres described how appellant treated him while he was confined. (RR\n\nXXIV 84-94). Andres was bound with wire from a coat hanger while appellant\n\nrepeatedly punched him, kicked him, hit him over the head with a shower curtain,\n\nhit his feet with a mallet and urinated on him.      (RR XXIV 86-90, 93-94).\n\nAppellant told Andres he was going to kill him. (RR XXIV 87). William testified\n\nappellant physically beat him as well; appellant threw him to the floor, stomped\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fon his back and spit on him. (RR XXIV 105-108). Appellant also hit William with\n\na revolver, tied him up with the wire from a coat hanger and held a knife to his\n\nthroat, toes and penis, threatening to cut him. (RR XXIV 109-110).\n\n      Appellant and his accomplices were charged with kidnapping and\n\npossession of weapons. (RR XXIV 64-65). Appellant pled guilty to the charges\n\nand was sentenced to 16 years confinement in Puerto Rico. (RR XXIV 65-67;\n\nState’s Exhibit Number 121). While incarcerated, an inspection of appellant’s cell\n\nrevealed his plans to escape, the window pane was loose and open to the outside\n\nand he had hidden a rope of bed sheets and a map of Puerto Rico. (RR XXIV 120-\n\n127). A cell phone was also found on his person, which is prohibited in a\n\ncorrectional facility. (RR XXIV 128).\n\n      Appellant continued to cause safety concerns while incarcerated in the\n\nUnited States. (XXV 134-135, 139-140). He was booked into the Harris County\n\nJail on February 12, 2010 and was classified as a high-risk inmate and placed into\n\nadministrative separation, where he remained for two years. (RR XXV 145). Two\n\nmonths after being moved from separation, on September 23, 2012, appellant\n\npossessed a prohibited weapon in a penal institution, by confiscating a razor blade\n\nand hiding it inside his bed. (XXV 126-133, 137-138, 145, 147).\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      After the presentment of punishment evidence, the jury answered the\n\nspecial issues in a manner mandating the imposition of the death penalty. (CR\n\n523-527; RR XXVIII 3-5).\n\n      In the first special issue, the jury unanimously found from the evidence\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt there is a probability that appellant would commit acts\n\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. (CR 523; RR\n\nXXVIII 3).\n\n      In the second special issue, the jury unanimously found from the evidence\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that appellant himself actually caused the death of\n\nAdam, on the occasion in question, or if he did not actually cause the death of\n\nAdam, that he intended to kill Adam, or that he anticipated that a human life\n\nwould be taken. (CR 524; RR XXVIII 3-4).\n\n      In the third special issue, the jury unanimously found, after taking into\n\nconsideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the\n\ndefendant’s character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the\n\ndefendant, that there was not sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that\n\na sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed. (CR\n\n525-526; RR XXVIII 4).\n\n      The trial court orally sentenced appellant to death. (RR XVIII 4-5).\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                                       14\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellant’s conviction for capital murder and imposition of the death\n\npenalty should be affirmed by this Court.\n\nReply to appellant’s first issue — Appellant has not shown the trial court abused\nits discretion in denying his motion to suppress evidence, where the State\nestablished the chain of custody and there was nothing to indicate the evidence\nwas contaminated. None of the evidence admitted into evidence was tested by the\nHPD crime lab.\n\nReply to appellant’s second issue — Appellant’s confrontation complaints are\nnot preserved for this Court’s review because he did not make an objection at trial.\n\nReply to appellant’s third issue — The evidence is legally sufficient to support\nappellant’s conviction for capital murder. Appellant kidnapped a six-year old\nchild and ordered his accomplice to kill him.\n\nReply to appellant’s fourth and fifth issues — Appellant has not shown the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in admitting extraneous evidence of his bond forfeiture\nand failure to appear under Rules 403 and 404(b).\n\nReply to appellant sixth and seventh issues — Appellant has not shown the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding mitigation evidence regarding his\ncompletion of bible study or assistance to law enforcement because it constituted\nhearsay.\n\nReply to appellant’s eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh issues — Appellant has\nnot shown that closing argument by the prosecutor was impermissible, or that it\ncaused him to suffer harm in this case.\n\nReply to appellant’s twelfth issue — Appellant has not shown the trial court\nerred in denying his motion for a new trial based upon jury misconduct, where he\nclaims the act of the jury foreman referring to his Bible during deliberations was an\noutside influence.\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                    REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FIRST ISSUE\n\n      In his first point of error, appellant challenges the trial court’s denial of his\n\nmotion to suppress. Appellant filed a written motion to suppress the results of all\n\nDNA testing. (CR 454-456). At the pre-trial hearing, he focused on problems\n\nwith the HPD crime lab, and suggested the physical evidence in his case was\n\ncontaminated, and thus the DNA analysis was unreliable. (RR XVI 3-121). The\n\ntrial court disagreed and found the evidence and test results were relevant and\n\nreliable, and denied appellant’s motion to suppress. (RR XVII 3-17).\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      A trial court’s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence will not be set aside\n\nabsent a showing of abuse of discretion. Maddox v. State, 682 S.W.2d 563, 564 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1985). This Court does not engage in its own factual review. Instead,\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s ruling, this\n\nCourt considers only whether the trial court improperly applied the law to the\n\nfacts. Romero v. State, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\n\n      At a suppression hearing, the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of\n\nthe witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. Id; see also State v. Ross, 32\n\nS.W.3d 853, 855 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (because the trial court is the exclusive\n\nfinder of fact in a motion to suppress hearing, it may choose to believe or disbelieve\n\nall or any part of a witness’s testimony). Therefore, if the record supports the trial\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcourt’s findings, this Court should not disturb those findings. Romero, 800 S.W.2d\n\nat 543.\n\nMotion to Suppress Evidence\n\n      The State presented testimony from SANE nurse Gloria Kologinczok. (RR\n\nXVI 23-25; XIX 37-50; State’s Exhibit Number 1). She was working at St. Joseph’s\n\nHospital in Houston on October 1, 1992 and performed a sexual assault\n\nexamination of Diana Garcia at 3:45 a.m. (RR XVI 25; RR XIX 43). Shortly after,\n\nat 4:24 a.m., she turned over the sexual assault evidence collection kit to HPD\n\nOfficer W.T. Bredemeyer. (RR XVI 25; RR XIX 49, 59; State’s Exhibit Number\n\n33). He maintained custody of the evidence and transported it to the HPD\n\nproperty room. (RR XIX 59-60).\n\n      Police were unsuccessful in making contact with appellant during the initial\n\ninvestigation of this case in 1992; appellant fled the country after the offense was\n\ncommitted. (RR XVI 36). The case went unsolved and was re-opened 15 years\n\nlater. (RR XVI 28-30).\n\n      In November of 2004, a cold case squad within HPD homicide was created.\n\n(RR XVI 28). In September 2007, HPD Sergeant Mehl located evidence in the\n\nHPD property room that had been collected in 1992. (RR XVI 29-30). On October\n\n2, 2007, Mehl sent some blood samples and three pieces of evidence to Orchid\n\nCellmark for analysis — a cigar, a sexual assault examination kit and a cutting\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\ffrom a pair of women’s panties. (RR XVI 30-35). At that time, HPD did not\n\npossess a DNA sample for appellant. (RR XVI 36-37).\n\n      In 2008, HPD Sergeant Stephens located appellant in a Puerto Rican prison\n\nand obtained a court order for a sample of his DNA. (RR XVI 37-38). FBI agents\n\nin Puerto Rico went to the prison where appellant was incarcerated and obtained\n\nthe DNA sample. (RR XVI 38). Mehl received the sample on May 23, 2008 and\n\nthen shipped it to Orchid for analysis with the previous items. (RR XVI 38-39).\n\n      The evidence was received by Matt Quartaro, a supervisor with Orchid\n\nCellmark. (RR XVI 48-60). Instead of relying on the DNA extractions done by\n\nHPD, Orchid performed their own DNA extractions from the evidence. (RR XVI\n\n51). When Orchid received appellant’s DNA sample, it was compared against the\n\nthree main pieces of evidence — the cigar, the sexual assault examination kit and a\n\ncutting from the panties. (RR XVI 59-60).\n\n      Orchid’s report indicated: the DNA profile on the cigar left at the crime\n\nscene was a match for appellant; the sperm fraction from the cutting of the panties\n\nwas a mixture of DNA and the major DNA profile belonged to appellant; and\n\nappellant could not be ruled out as the contributor to the DNA mixture from the\n\nvaginal swab. (RR XVI 39, 59-60). In terms of the statistical profile match,\n\nQuartaro testified the probability of that DNA profile repeating in the North\n\nAmerican population was 1 in 71.5 quadrillion of unrelated individuals. (RR XVI\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f59-60). Once Mehl received this report, he filed capital murder charges on\n\nappellant. (RR XVI 39).\n\nAnalysis\n\n      Appellant claims the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence,\n\nthe cigar, panties and sexual assault kit that included blood samples and vaginal\n\nswabs, because the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody; this\n\nobjection was made during trial and was overruled by the trial judge. (RR XXI\n\n120-124; State’s Exhibit Numbers 33-A, 33-B, 33-C, 33-D and 95).\n\n      The State meets the authentication requirement for admissibility of\n\nevidence once it has shown the beginning and the end of the chain of custody,\n\nparticularly when the chain ends at a laboratory. McGregor v. State, 394 S.W.3d 90,\n\n125 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d); see also TEX. R. EVID. 901(a).\n\nAbsent evidence of tampering or fraud, any gaps in the chain of custody do not\n\naffect the admissibility of the evidence, but rather go to the weight that the fact-\n\nfinder should give the evidence, which may be brought out and argued by the\n\nparties.   Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491, 503–504 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\nAppellant does not make a specific claim about a gap in the chain, but instead\n\nseems to allege that the evidence was tampered with and/or compromised due to\n\nissues at the HPD crime lab before the evidence was tested.\n\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f      The proponent of scientific evidence, such as the DNA test results offered by\n\nthe State in this case, must prove to the trial judge, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence and outside the presence of the jury, that the proferred evidence is\n\nreliable and therefore relevant. TEX. R. EVID. 702; Kelly v. State, 824 S.W.2d 568, 573\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (interpreting Rule 702). Any issue of contamination\n\nwould be pertinent to the trial court in deciding if the evidence was reliable. See\n\nJackson v. State, 17 S.W.3d 664, 670–72 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (analyzing whether\n\nDNA evidence was reliable when allegations of contamination were raised); Hines\n\nv. State, 38 S.W.3d 805, 808 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.)\n\n(applying the Kelly reliability analysis to claims of contaminated DNA).\n\n       The sexual assault kit of Diana Garcia was collected by a qualified SANE\n\nnurse hours after the sexual assault. The kit included Diana’s panties, vaginal\n\nswabs and blood samples. (RR XVII 6). The kit was sealed and stored in the HPD\n\nproperty room at 1200 Travis. (RR XVII 6-7). In 1992, the evidence was processed\n\nand analyzed by employees of the HPD crime lab and then returned to storage,\n\nwhere it remained until 2007, when it was sent to Orchid Cellmark for analysis.\n\n(RR XVII 7).\n\n      Several blood samples were collected in 1992 and also stored at the HPD\n\nproperty room on Travis — those of Arturo Garcia, Candido Lebron, Bienviendo\n\nMelo, Leonardo German and Carmelo Martinez Santana. (RR XVII 7-8). They\n\n\n                                          20\n\fwere tested by the HPD crime lab and returned to the property room in 1992. (RR\n\nXVII 8). They were not retrieved again until December 2, 2007, when Sergeant\n\nMehl sent them to Orchid Cellmark. (RR XVII 8). The results from the HPD\n\ncrime lab were not admitted in this trial; only the results from Orchid Cellmark\n\nwere admitted. (RR XVII 8).\n\n      The cigar taken from the crime scene was stored at the HPD property room\n\non Goliad from October 1992 to October 2007. (RR XVII 6). The cigar was\n\nlocated in a larger container of evidence and there was nothing to indicate it had\n\nbeen tampered with during that time. (RR XVII 6). Although it may have been\n\nsent to the HPD crime lab with other evidence, there is nothing to indicate it was\n\never tested by the lab. (RR XVI 112-113). The package appeared unopened when it\n\nwas sent to Orchid Cellmark for DNA testing on October 2, 2007. (RR XVII 6, 8).\n\n      In 2008, a sample of appellant’s DNA sample was obtained and shipped\n\ndirectly to Orchid for analysis. (RR XVI 37-39; RR XVII 10). It was never stored\n\nor tested by the HPD crime lab. This known sample was compared against the\n\nprofiles found in the sexual assault kit evidence and cigar. (RR XVII 10).\n\n      In support of his contention that the evidence was tainted, appellant\n\nprovided the trial court with the Bromwich Report, which detailed issues in the\n\nHPD crime lab. (Defense Exhibits 2-7). The report was initiated in 2003 upon the\n\nclosing of the HPD crime lab and discussed errors that were made by the lab, as\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fwell as deficiency in documentation and allegations of misconduct. (RR XVII 12-\n\n13). The trial court noted the report made specific recommendations to the\n\naddress the issues, all of which were followed by HPD. (RR XVII 13-14).\n\n       Appellant’s contamination argument fails for two reasons. First, the State\n\ndid not present any evidence in this case that was tested by the old HPD crime\n\nlab.1 Every piece of evidence he complains about was tested by Orchid Cellmark.\n\nSecond, although the evidence was stored at two of the HPD property rooms,\n\nthere was no evidence of contamination or tampering.\n\n       A time delay in the collection and testing of evidence does not render the\n\nevidence unreliable when there is no evidence of contamination or tampering. See\n\nDossett v. State, 216 S.W.3d 7, 21-22 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, pet. ref’d) (State\n\nsufficiently established chain of custody of victim’s sexual assault kit to admit\n\nexpert testimony about results on DNA testing on samples contained in kit, even\n\nthough 20–year period existed between collection of kit and DNA testing).\n\n       Similarly, the fact that the evidence was previously tested by the HPD crime\n\nlab and then returned to HPD storage does not render the evidence unreliable. See\n\nLagrone v. State, 942 S.W.2d 602, 617 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (absent affirmative\n\nevidence of tampering, no reason to exclude evidence merely because it was kept\n\n1\n  A known DNA sample of appellant was tested by the new HPD crime lab in 2010. The trial\ncourt found this evidence was admissible since there were no longer concerns with the lab at\nthat time. And this evidence just corroborated the earlier findings from Orchid Cellmark in\n2008. (RR XVII 11-12).\n\n\n                                            22\n\fin evidence room for extended period of time and had undergone prior forensic\n\ntesting).\n\n      The State has no burden to disprove tampering; rather, appellant has the\n\nburden to present affirmative evidence of tampering. Garcia v. State, 537 S.W.2d\n\n930, 934 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976). A showing of the possibility of tampering is not\n\nsufficient to bar admission of the evidence, and goes only to the weight of the\n\nevidence. See Darrow v. State, 504 S.W.2d 416, 417 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974) (evidence\n\nthat marihuana was stored in officer’s locker for two weeks in room to which\n\nothers had access, but no key to locker, showed only the possibility of tampering,\n\nand did not prohibit admission); see also Dossett, 216 S.W.3d at 21 (defendant only\n\nshowed there was a possibility of tampering or contamination, which was\n\ninsufficient to exclude the evidence).\n\n      Appellant has not shown the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress. See Romero, 800 S.W.2d at 543. Therefore, appellant’s first\n\npoint of error should be overruled.\n\n\n                  REPLY TO APPELLANT’S SECOND ISSUE\n\n      In his second issue, appellant claims the trial court violated his right to\n\nconfrontation, by not allowing him to cross-examine witnesses and present an\n\ninvestigative report to support his defense during his motion to suppress and at\n\ntrial. The constitutional right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine\n\n                                         23\n\fthe witnesses at trial and the opportunity to show that a witness is biased or that\n\nhis testimony is exaggerated or unbelievable. Irby v. State, 327 S.W.3d 138, 145 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2010).\n\n      Appellant complains he was unable to cross-examine three of the State’s\n\nwitnesses, Sergeant Mehl, Agent Guzman and Courtney Head, regarding\n\ncontamination issues at the HPD crime lab during trial. (Appellant’s brief 71-72).\n\nBut this issue is not preserved for this Court’s review. Appellant did not lodge an\n\nobjection at the hearing or trial on this basis. (RR XVI 108-110; RR XX 56-66; 77;\n\nRR XXI 155, 157).       A defendant waives his constitutional right to confront\n\nwitnesses if he does not object at trial. Melendez–Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305,\n\n314 n. 3 (2009); Clark v. State, 365 S.W.3d 333, 339 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). Because\n\nappellant did not object on confrontation grounds, he has waived appellate review\n\nof his second point of error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1.\n\n      Further, the subject of appellant’s attempted cross-examination was\n\nprevious contamination problems in the HPD crime lab outlined in a report\n\nauthored by Michael Bromwich. As discussed in more detail in the State’s reply to\n\nappellant’s first issue, none of the evidence admitted in this case was tested at the\n\nHPD crime lab during the time frame of contamination concern, making the\n\nevidence irrelevant to the issues in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                           24\n\f      During the motion to suppress, the trial court determined the report and\n\nareas of cross-examination regarding it were not relevant, and thus not admissible\n\nunder Rules 401 and 402. (RR XVII 12-14). See TEX. R. EVID. 401 (evidence is\n\nrelevant if it tends to make the existence of any fact of consequence tot eh\n\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be\n\nwithout the evidence); TEX. R. EVID. 402 (only relevant evidence is admissible).\n\nThe trial court also found that any potential probative value of the evidence was\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, finding it would cause confusion of\n\nthe DNA issues and mislead the jury. (RR XVII 13-14). See TEX. R. EVID. 403.\n\n      Because the evidence was not relevant, the trial court did not err in limiting\n\nappellant’s cross-examination on the subject of contamination. See Foster v. State,\n\n180 S.W.3d 248, 251 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, pet. ref’d) (trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion or violate defendant’s right to confrontation when it limited\n\nhis cross-examination; defendant sought to ask a question that was irrelevant and\n\ncalculated to confuse the jury because it injected new facts into the case regarding\n\na situation that was not before the jury).\n\n      Appellant did not offer any additional argument on why the evidence should\n\nbe admitted at trial. His second point of error should be overruled.\n\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f                      REPLY TO APPELLANT’S THIRD ISSUE\n\n         In his third issue on appeal, appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting his conviction for capital murder.\n\n         Appellant was charged with the offense of capital murder, that on or about\n\nSeptember 30, 1992, while in the course of committing or attempting to commit\n\nthe kidnapping of Adam, he intentionally caused the death of Adam by stabbing\n\nhim with a deadly weapon, namely, a sharp instrument or by some unknown\n\nmanner and means. (CR 2-3; RR XXIII 4, 31). The jury was charged they could\n\nfind him guilty as a principal or party to the offense. (CR 487-488). TEX. PENAL\n\nCODE ANN. § 7.02(a)(2) (West 2013); TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 7.02(b) (West\n\n2013).\n\n         In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction,\n\nthe appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\nwhen determining whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements\n\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19\n\n(1979); Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 895 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (the Jackson\n\nstandard is the only standard a reviewing court should apply in determining\n\nwhether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction).\n\n         The jury, as the sole judge of the facts, is entitled to resolve any conflicts in\n\nthe evidence, to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and to determine the weight\n\n\n                                            26\n\fgiven to any particular piece of evidence. Jones v. State, 944 S.W.2d 642, 647 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1996). When conducting a legal sufficiency review, this Court does\n\nnot engage in a second evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence, but\n\nonly ensures the jury reached a rational decision. Muniz v. State, 851 S.W.2d 238,\n\n246 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n      Appellant lists several reasons why the evidence is insufficient to support\n\nhis conviction. He challenges his identification as the culprit, the credibility of\n\nfour witnesses, as well as the strength of the evidence regarding Diana’s sexual\n\nassault and Adam’s death. Appellant also claims there was no evidence of his\n\nmotive to commit this crime. (Appellant’s brief 76-85).\n\n      Appellant challenges the evidence identifying him, focusing on the incorrect\n\ndescriptions of the suspects as black men by police early in the investigation.\n\nDiana and Arturo had described the men as having dark complexions, speaking\n\nwith Spanish accents.      Nothing about the police’s initial report renders the\n\nevidence of appellant’s identity insufficient, especially in the light of the DNA\n\nevidence revealing he was the man who sexually assaulted Diana. Although\n\nappellant has challenged the admissibility of the DNA evidence, even improperly\n\nadmitted evidence may be considered when reviewing the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. Wilson v. State, 7 S.W.3d 136, 141 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). The evidence of\n\nappellant’s identity as the perpetrator is sufficient.\n\n\n                                           27\n\f      Appellant complains that several of the State’s key witnesses posed\n\ncredibility problems and provided testimony that was inconsistent. Diana Garcia\n\nand Arturo Rodriguez testified regarding what happened to them at the apartment\n\non September 30, 1992, establishing the sexual assault of Diana, the beating of\n\nArturo and kidnapping of Adam. Appellant complains their testimony was not\n\ncredible because the couple initially lied to police about their involvement in\n\nselling drugs. Diana admitted they lied to police the first night, because they were\n\nafraid, but told the truth the following day. (RR XVIII 166-167).\n\n      Carmelo Santana provided evidence about the kidnapping and murder of\n\nAdam, as he had been with appellant on that night. He established that appellant\n\ntook Adam from the apartment and ordered Aviles-Barrosso to kill him. Appellant\n\ncomplains Santana’s testimony is not credible because he was serving a federal\n\nsentence at the time of trial, he had a motive to distance himself from the crime\n\nand some of his testimony contradicted his earlier statements.\n\n      Angelita Rodriguez was appellant’s wife at the time of this offense. She\n\nprovided evidence about appellant’s drug dealing, his immediate flight from the\n\ncountry and testified appellant admitted to her that he killed Adam. Appellant\n\ncomplains she was not a credible witness because she had a motive to see\n\nappellant punished, because he had been unfaithful and left her in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f      The concerns appellant has articulated with regard to these witnesses were\n\nall presented and argued to the jury during trial. The jury was free to accept one\n\nversion of the facts and reject another, and they could reject any part of a witness’s\n\ntestimony. Sharp v. State, 707 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). None of these\n\nmatters render the evidence insufficient. See Curry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 406\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (any inconsistencies in the evidence are viewed in favor of\n\nthe verdict).\n\n      Appellant complains there was insufficient evidence to show he sexually\n\nassaulted Diana. He claims the lack of physical evidence, coupled with the DNA\n\nevidence, merely shows sexual contact with Diana, not sexual assault. During\n\nclosing argument, defense counsel suggested Diana and appellant had a consensual\n\nsexual relationship. (RR XXIII 44-45).\n\n      But this is contrary to Diana’s testimony. She gave very specific details\n\nabout being blindfolded and sexually assaulted that night. Diana recalled that the\n\nperpetrator ejaculated, which was consistent with her physical exam, where DNA\n\nevidence was left behind. SANE nurse Kologinczok testified she did not observe\n\nany signs of physical injury during Diana’s sexual assault exam, but noted that in\n\nmost exams, she did not find physical injuries. (RR XIX 48-49). Appellant\n\nadmitted to Santana that he sexually assaulted Diana. (RR XX 145).\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f      Although there was no physical injuries tending to show sexual assault,\n\nDiana’s testimony and the DNA results were more than sufficient to show\n\nappellant was the man who sexually assaulted her. See Bargas v. State, 252 S.W.3d\n\n876, 889 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (it is well-settled that a\n\nvictim’s uncorroborated testimony is sufficient on its own to support a conviction\n\nfor sexual assault and the lack of physical evidence will not render the evidence\n\ninsufficient).   Although the sexual assault evidence was important to show\n\nappellant’s presence and participation in the kidnapping and murder of Adam, the\n\njury did not have to find the elements of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nAppellant was not charged with the sexual assault of Diana; the underlying felony\n\nin the capital murder indictment was kidnapping. (CR 2-3).\n\n      Appellant complains the evidence is insufficient to prove he killed Adam as\n\nalleged in the indictment because the State, through Dr. Wolf, was unable to\n\nprovide conclusive evidence regarding Adam’s cause of death. But direct evidence\n\nis not required. Expert opinion testimony is not required to prove cause of death,\n\nand cause of death may be proven solely by circumstantial evidence. See Fountain v.\n\nState, 401 S.W.3d 344, 356-357 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. ref’d).\n\n      Dr. Wolf testified Adam’s manner of death was homicide. (RR XX 10-12;\n\nState’s Exhibit Number 55). He opined that Adam may have been stabbed, but he\n\nwas unable to provide an opinion on the cause of death due to Adam’s\n\n\n                                        30\n\fdecomposition. (RR XX 8-9, 12). Adam’s body was found over a month after his\n\nkidnapping and had been submerged in water, so Dr. Wolf was unable to assess\n\nhis skin surfaces and organs. (RR XX 8). He also stated that any blood from\n\nAdam’s pajamas would have washed away during the time he was in the water.\n\n(RR XX 14-15).\n\n      Both DNA evidence and the testimony of Santana placed appellant at the\n\napartment when Adam was kidnapped. Santana explained how appellant directed\n\nAviles-Barrosso, who was carrying a knife, to kill Adam. Santana saw Adam’s\n\ntorso covered in blood and helped sink the body, where it was located a month\n\nlater, decomposed. Appellant later admitted to his wife that he killed Adam. This\n\nevidence establishes Adam’s cause of death. See Morris v. State, 322 S.W.2d 632, 634\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1959) (where the State did not present expert medical testimony\n\nregarding victim’s cause of death, testimony regarding the victim being stabbed by\n\nthe defendant was sufficient to establish the cause of death); see also McDuff v. State,\n\n939 S.W.2d 607, 614 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (the State’s inability to produce or\n\nidentify the body or remains does not preclude a murder conviction).\n\n      The evidence is sufficient to support that Adam was stabbed with a deadly\n\nweapon, a sharp instrument, or by some unknown manner and means. See Turro v.\n\nState, 950 S.W.2d 390, 397 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1997, pet. ref’d) (although\n\nmedical examiner conceded his opinions on the time and cause of death were not\n\n\n                                          31\n\fabsolute and that he could not entirely eliminate the possibility that the victim\n\ndied from accidental drowning, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s\n\nconviction for murder because proof beyond a reasonable doubt need not be proof\n\nbeyond all doubt).\n\n      Motive is not an element of the offense and thus does not need to be proved\n\nin order to establish the commission of capital murder. See Rodriguez v. State, 486\n\nS.W.2d 355, 358 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972). While the State need not have proved\n\nmotive, evidence of motive for the offense was presented, that motive being\n\nappellant’s revenge for Diana and Arturo leaving the drug trade. Krebsbach v. State,\n\n962 S.W.2d 728, 732 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1998, pet. ref’d). Santana testified they\n\nwent to the apartment that night to look for drugs and money. When Santana\n\nopposed the kidnapping of Adam, appellant explained he took him because Adam\n\nsaw his face, and arguably could identify him. This evidence could have been\n\nconsidered by the jury in determining appellant’s guilt.\n\n      Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the jury\n\ncould have found the essential elements of capital murder — that appellant\n\nmurdered Adam in the course of committing kidnapping — beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Appellant’s third point of error should be overruled.\n\n                       \n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f            REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FOURTH & FIFTH ISSUES\n\n      In two points of error, appellant complains the trial court erred by\n\nadmitting extraneous evidence that appellant failed to appear for a court\n\nappearance on October 8, 1992 relating to a criminal offense. Appellant’s fourth\n\npoint of error appears to challenge the admission of evidence under Rule 404(b),\n\nand his fifth point of error contests the trial court’s ruling with regard to Rule 403.\n\n      This Court reviews a trial court’s decision to admit evidence concerning an\n\nextraneous offense for an abuse of discretion. Page v. State, 137 S.W.3d 75, 78 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2004). As long as the trial court’s ruling is within the “zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement,” the trial court does not abuse its discretion, and this\n\nCourt should uphold the ruling. McGregor v. State, 394 S.W.3d 90, 117 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d).\n\n      Rule 404(b) prohibits the admission of an extraneous offense at trial to\n\nprove a defendant’s character or to show that the defendant acted in conformity\n\nwith that character unless admitted for other purposes, such as proof of motive,\n\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake\n\nor accident. TEX. R. EVID. 404(b). Relevant evidence may be excluded if its\n\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. TEX.\n\nR. EVID. 403.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f       The State offered testimony from FBI Special Agent Eric Johnson. (RR XIX\n\n131-145). He joined the kidnapping investigation on October 1, 1992 and his\n\nprimary suspect was appellant. (RR XIX 135-139). Agent Johnson learned that\n\nappellant missed a court appearance on October 8, 1992 for a criminal case in\n\nHarris County and his bond was forfeited. (RR XIX 140-142; RR XX 103-104;\n\nState’s Exhibit Number 36). This was one week after Adam’s kidnapping. (RR\n\nXIX 142). After speaking with appellant’s wife, Agent Johnson began looking for\n\nappellant in Puerto Rico. (RR XIX 144-145).\n\n       Prior to the presentment of this bond forfeiture evidence, the parties had a\n\nlengthy discussion about the admissibility of this evidence. (RR XIX 105-130).\n\nThe trial court limited its ruling to the fact that appellant had failed to appear for a\n\ncourt appearance and his bond was forfeited. (RR XIX 113-115). The trial judge\n\ndid not allow Agent Johnson to reveal that the offense was for drug possession or\n\nthat it was a pending felony offense, finding this information would be too\n\nprejudicial. (RR XIX 121). The judge also ordered that the bond forfeiture\n\npaperwork be redacted, to delete any references to the offense being a felony or for\n\ndrug possession.2 (RR XIX 123-124, 127; State’s Exhibit Number 36).\n\n\n\n2\n  FBI Special Agent Johnson explained to the trial judge that he had filed an unlawful flight to\navoid prosecution case against appellant after he bond forfeited; he explained he obtained the\nwarrant so he could legally search for appellant throughout the United States. (RR XIX 111-112).\nBut the trial court did not allow evidence of this federal charge to be heard by the jury. (RR XIX\n113-115).\n\n\n                                               34\n\f      Evidence of bond forfeiture may be admissible to show flight under Rule\n\n404(b). Bigby v. State, 892 S.W.2d 864, 883 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Geeslin v. State,\n\n630 S.W.2d 512, 513 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1982, no pet.). The evidence of flight\n\nis admissible as a circumstance from which guilt may be inferred, even though it\n\nmay show the commission of an extraneous offense. Bigby, 892 S.W.2d at 883.\n\nThis evidence is also relevant to show efforts made to locate or apprehend a\n\ndefendant, his pursuit and capture, circumstances of his arrest including his\n\nresistance. Cantrell v. State, 731 S.W.2d 84, 92-93 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).\n\n      To exclude evidence of flight after relevancy has been established, the\n\ndefendant has the burden to affirmatively show that the flight was unrelated to\n\nthe charged offense. Burks v. State, 876 S.W.2d 877, 903 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).\n\nAppellant acknowledges the authority upon which the trial court admitted the\n\nevidence, but attempts to distinguish it from his case. Cantrell, 731 S.W.2d at 92-\n\n93. (RR XIX 125-126). Appellant argues because he bond forfeited on a criminal\n\ncharge that was not the one he was on trial for, i.e. the drug possession case, it was\n\nerror for the trial court to admit the evidence.\n\n      But the timing of appellant’s flight from the United States demonstrates it\n\nwas related to the capital murder. The day after Adam’s kidnapping and murder,\n\nappellant told his wife and Santana that he was leaving the country and traveling\n\nto Puerto Rico. (RR XX 99, 158-159). It was not a planned trip. (RR XX 100, 158-\n\n\n                                          35\n\f159). Appellant immediately sold his car, used the money to purchase a plane\n\nticket and had Santana take him to the airport. (RR XX 162, 164). When his wife\n\nvisited him two months later, appellant admitted he had killed Adam. (RR XX\n\n107). See Burks v. State, 227 S.W.3d 138, 148–49 (Tex. App—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2006, pet. ref’d) (evidence is relevant to show defendant’s consciousness of guilt).\n\n      Appellant did not present any evidence to show his failure to appear for\n\ncourt was anything but flight from prosecution for this capital murder. Therefore,\n\nhe has failed to meet his burden to exclude evidence of flight. See Burks, 876 S.W.2d\n\nat 904 (flight evidence was relevant and admissible where defendant made no\n\nshowing that flight was related to a circumstances unrelated to the offense).\n\n      Similarly, appellant has not established the prejudicial effect of this evidence\n\noutweighs the probative value. TEX. R. EVID. 403. The bond forfeiture evidence in\n\nthis case was evidence of flight, relevant to show appellant’s consciousness of\n\nguilt. Torres v. State, 794 S.W.2d 596, 598 (Tex. App.—Austin 1990, no pet.)\n\n(consciousness of guilt is perhaps one of the strongest kinds of evidence of guilt).\n\n      The evidence was significant in that it demonstrated the timing and context\n\nof appellant’s departure from the United States. Court records indicated appellant\n\nhad been present for every court appearance on his pending drug case in 1992, at\n\nleast 14 settings over the span of 15 months, prior to his missed appearance on\n\nOctober 8, 1992.     (State’s Exhibit Number 36).       The documents also reveal\n\n\n                                         36\n\fappellant forfeited a $5,000 bond for failing to appear in court. (State’s Exhibit\n\nNumber 36). This evidence established appellant had been diligent about his\n\ncourt appearances until the murder occurred and forfeited a large amount of\n\nmoney when he left the country, making the evidence more probative than\n\nprejudicial. See Hyde v. State, 846 S.W.2d 503, 505 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n1993, pet. ref’d) (a defendant’s failure to appear is not the type of misconduct that\n\nhas a great unfair prejudicial danger).\n\n      Appellant has not shown the trial court abused its discretion in admitting\n\nevidence of his bond forfeiture under Rule 404(b) or Rule 403. See Bigby, 892\n\nS.W.2d at 883-884 (evidence of defendant’s flight was admissible under both Rule\n\n404(b) and Rule 403 as relevant evidence of defendant’s guilt of the charged crime\n\nof capital murder where the State sought the death penalty); Hyde, 846 S.W.2d at\n\n505 (evidence of defendant’s failure to appear at first scheduled trial and his\n\nforfeiture of bond was properly admissible to show flight, and trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in determining that danger of unfair prejudice did not\n\noutweigh probative value of flight evidence under Rule 403).\n\n      Appellant’s fourth and fifth issues should be overruled.\n\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\f           REPLY TO APPELLANT’S SIXTH & SEVENTH ISSUES\n\n      In two points of error, appellant complains the trial court erred in\n\npreventing him from presenting evidence during the punishment phase of trial,\n\nrelevant to the mitigation special issue outlined in Article 37.071. See TEX. CODE\n\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 37.071 § 2 (a)(1) (West 2013).\n\n      In his sixth issue, appellant complains the trial court erred in excluding\n\nbible study certificates. Appellant attempted to offer Defense Exhibit Numbers\n\n48-55, which are bible study certificates appellant claimed he earned while in\n\nprison in Puerto Rico, through his brother, punishment witness Joel Cruz-Garcia.\n\n(RR XXVI 56-58). The defense claimed the basis for offering them was that\n\nappellant had talked to the witness about these things, “Not that the witness took\n\nthe courses with him, but he’s talked to him about it.” Joel Cruz-Garcia testified\n\nhe went to church with appellant on one occasion, but he did not indicate he\n\npossessed any personal knowledge about appellant’s participation in bible study.\n\n(RR XXVI 41-42, 54).\n\n      The State objected on the basis of hearsay and defense counsel admitted the\n\ncertificates were hearsay. (RR XXVI 57-58). He did not argue that any exception\n\nto the hearsay rule applied. (RR XXVI 57-58). The trial court inquired whether\n\nappellant had gotten a business record affidavit for the certificates. (RR XXVI 58).\n\nDefense counsel replied no and that he was not inclined to put appellant on the\n\n\n\n                                        38\n\fstand just to get them into evidence. (RR XXVI 58). The trial judge ruled that\n\nwhile the certificates may be relevant, they were hearsay if admitted through that\n\nparticular witness. (RR XXVI 58).\n\n      In his seventh issue, appellant claims the trial court prevented him from\n\nintroducing evidence that he was an informant for the FBI, DEA or INS. Agent\n\nJuan DeJesus Rodriguez, who works with the police in Puerto Rico, testified he\n\ninvestigated the kidnappings of Andres Buten and William Martinez. (RR XXIV\n\n43-61). During cross-examination, defense counsel wanted to inquire whether\n\nRodriguez had learned during his investigation that appellant was a corroborating\n\nwitness for the FBI, DEA or INS. (RR XXIV69-70).\n\n      The jury was taken out and defense counsel asked the witness on voir dire\n\nwhether he could verify this information. (RR XXIV 70-73). Rodriguez stated he\n\nwas told orally that appellant had cooperated with law enforcement in the past,\n\nbut he never got confirmation in writing. (RR XXIV 72-73). There was no\n\nevidence appellant was cooperating with law enforcement in regard to the\n\nkidnapping cases in Puerto Rico. (RR XXIV 73). And Rodriguez did not provide\n\nthe source of this information; thus the State objected on hearsay grounds. (RR\n\nXXIV 72-74). Defense counsel again did not argue that any hearsay exceptions\n\napplied.   The judge ruled it was inadmissible hearsay at this juncture, but\n\ninstructed defense counsel if he could present a witness who had personal\n\n\n\n                                       39\n\fknowledge that appellant had previously cooperated with law enforcement, she\n\nwould admit the evidence, as being relevant to mitigation. (RR XXIV 74).\n\n      The decision to admit or exclude evidence is within the discretion of the\n\ntrial court. Weatherred v. State, 15 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Unless\n\nthe trial judge’s decision was outside the “zone of reasonable disagreement,” an\n\nappellate court should uphold the ruling. Torres v. State, 71 S.W.3d 758, 760 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2002).\n\n      Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while\n\ntestifying at trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted. TEX. R. EVID. 801(d). As a general rule, hearsay evidence is inadmissible\n\nunless it falls within one of the many exceptions. TEX. R. EVID. 802. It is well-\n\nsettled if the testimony fits an exception to the hearsay rule (or if the evidence was\n\nnot being offered for the truth of the matter asserted) appellant, as the proponent\n\nof the evidence, had the burden of demonstrating the applicability of that\n\nexemption or exception. Martinez v. State, 178 S.W.3d 806, 815 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2005); see also Cofield v. State, 891 S.W.2d 952, 954 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994)\n\n(proponent of hearsay has the burden of showing that the testimony fits within an\n\nexception to the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay evidence).\n\nAppellant did not provide any avenue for admissibility regarding the evidence he\n\ncomplains should have been admitted. See In re E.A.K., 192 S.W.3d 133, 145 (Tex.\n\n\n                                         40\n\fApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (trial court erred in admitting\n\nhearsay evidence where party failed to lay proper predicate for admission).\n\n      Relying heavily on cases from the United States Supreme Court, appellant\n\nargues that this mitigation evidence should have been admitted, despite his failure\n\nto adhere to the rules of evidence, because it is violative of his Sixth and\n\nFourteenth Amendment’s due process right to present a defense. See Holmes v. South\n\nCarolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006) (exclusion of defense evidence of third-party guilt\n\ndenied the defendant a fair trial); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1972) (same).\n\n      But this Court has reviewed the scenario appellant presents and ruled\n\nagainst him. This Court held that the United States Constitution does not require\n\nadmission of mitigating evidence when it is inadmissible under state law, even\n\nwhen the evidence meets the test of constitutional relevancy. See Renteria v. State\n\n206 S.W.3d 689, 697 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n      Although both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have\n\nrecognized that no person shall be executed without the opportunity to bring all\n\nevidence of mitigating circumstances, the United States Constitution does not\n\nrequire the admission of evidence if it is in a form that is objectionable. Id.; see also\n\nLewis v. State, 815 S.W.2d 560, 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\n      The bottom line — relevant evidence must be presented in a form that is\n\nacceptable to the laws of evidence of the State in order to be received over\n\n\n                                           41\n\fobjection. Id. And this principle was re-affirmed in 2010 by this Court. See Smith v.\n\nState, No. AP-75793, 2010 WL 3787576 *19-23 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (not\n\ndesignated for publication).\n\n       In Smith, this Court evaluated a defense claim that mitigating evidence\n\nshould have been admitted, despite the hearsay nature of the evidence. See Smith,\n\n2010 WL 3787576 at *19-23. The trial court excluded appellant’s school records\n\nand a videotape because they did not comply with the rules of evidence pertaining\n\nto business records and hearsay. Id. Appellant did not argue that any exception to\n\nthe hearsay rule applied. Id. at *22.\n\n       This Court determined the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding the evidence over the State’s well-founded hearsay objection, holding\n\nthe defendant could not rely on the fundamental protections of due process to cure\n\nthe preventable error. Smith, 2010 WL 3787576 at *21. And the Court further\n\nopined that the United State Supreme Court’s decisions in Chambers and Holmes do\n\nnot alter this principle. Id. at *20.\n\n       This Court should similarly overrule appellant’s suggestion that his\n\nconstitutional right to present mitigation evidence trumps the rules of evidence.\n\nAppellant’s sixth and seventh points of error should be overruled.\n\n                         \n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fREPLY TO APPELLANT’S EIGHTH, NINTH, TENTH & ELEVENTH ISSUES\n\n      In four points of error, appellant complains the trial court erred by allowing\n\nthe prosecutor to present improper closing argument during both phases of trial.\n\nThe eighth and ninth points of error address closing argument during the guilt\n\nphase; the tenth and eleventh points of error address closing argument during the\n\npunishment phase.\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals has determined that proper jury argument\n\ngenerally falls within one of four areas: 1) summation of the evidence, 2) reasonable\n\ndeduction from the evidence, 3) answer to an argument of opposing counsel, and\n\n4) plea for law enforcement. Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 570 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2008). A prosecutor may not use closing arguments to present evidence that is\n\noutside the record. Freeman v. State, 340 S.W.3d 717, 728 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\nImproper references to facts that are neither in evidence nor inferable from the\n\nevidence are generally designed to arouse the passion and prejudice of the jury and,\n\nas such, are inappropriate. Borjan v. State, 787 S.W.2d 53, 57 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\n\nEighth & Ninth Points of Error\n\n      In his eighth issue, appellant complains the prosecutor engaged in improper\n\nargument when she injected facts outside the record during the guilt phase of trial.\n\nAppellant specifically complains of this passage:\n\n      PROSECUTOR: Let me give you another example, another example\n      of half the story. The SANE nurse. She came here and she said: Well,\n\n                                         43\n\f      there were no injuries. Wow, that must mean Obel Cruz-Garcia is\n      guilty — is not guilty of capital murder according to the defense\n      attorneys. No. Let’s talk about what else the SANE nurse said. And I\n      want to say she said 95 percent — it was a very high percentage — of\n      rape cases that she does SANE nurse examinations on —\n\n      DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection. Outside the record.\n\n      PROSECUTOR: — do not have any injuries.\n\n      THE COURT: Overruled. But I will remind the jury that you recall\n      the testimony from the witness stand and that is — that will be your\n      guide in your deliberations. Arguments of counsel is not evidence.\n      (sic) (RR XXIII 80).\n\n      SANE nurse Gloria Kologinczok testified she performed several hundred\n\nsexual assault exams during her tenure at St. Joseph’s Hospital. (RR XIX 40). She\n\nperformed the sexual assault exam of Diana on October 1, 1992. (RR XIX 48). She\n\ndid not see any signs of physical injury or trauma during this exam. (RR XIX 48).\n\nKologinczok testified that in most of the sexual assault exams she has performed,\n\nshe did not find physical injuries. (RR XIX 48-49).\n\n      Appellant is correct that the prosecutor mischaracterized the testimony\n\nprovided by the SANE nurse.        There is nothing in the record to indicate\n\nKologinczok quantified her testimony with a statistic regarding the lack of\n\nphysical injuries in her examinations. Although the prosecutor’s use of the high\n\npercentage could be inferable from Kologinczok’s testimony that “in most cases,”\n\nshe sees no physical injury. (RR XIX 48-49).\n\n\n\n\n                                        44\n\f      Regardless, error during closing argument is non-constitutional in nature,\n\nand a non-constitutional error that does not affect substantial rights must be\n\ndisregarded. TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b); Martinez v. State, 17 S.W.3d 677, 692–93 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2000). To determine whether appellant’s substantial rights were\n\naffected, this Court should balance the severity of the misconduct (i.e., the\n\nprejudicial effect), any curative measures, and the certainty of conviction absent\n\nthe misconduct. Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 259 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n      Viewing the State’s closing argument as a whole, this comment does not\n\nappear to be a willful and calculated effort to deprive appellant of a fair and\n\nimpartial trial. The prosecutor’s comment was a very small portion of her entire\n\nclosing argument at the guilt phase. (RR XXIII 80). She did not emphasize the\n\ncomment and immediately moved on after the objection. (RR XXIII 81). Further,\n\nviewing the record as a whole, appellant does not appear to have been prejudiced\n\nby the comment, as the SANE nurse did testify she rarely sees physical injuries.\n\n      While the trial court did sua sponte remind the jury that closing arguments\n\nwere not evidence, there was no curative instruction. See Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at\n\n728-729 (although not a curative instruction, court’s reminder to jury that\n\nargument was not evidence weighed in favor of harmless error). The evidence\n\npresented during the guilt phase demonstrated appellant was man who raped\n\nDiana, kidnapped Adam and ordered his death.            Given the brevity of the\n\n\n                                        45\n\fprosecutor’s comment, the lack of prejudice, and the strength of the evidence\n\nsupporting appellant’s conviction, any error associated with this comment was\n\nharmless. Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at 728-729. Appellant’s eighth issue should be\n\noverruled.\n\n      In his ninth issue, appellant complains the prosecutor improperly injected\n\nher personal beliefs regarding appellant’s guilt as a party during closing argument\n\nin the guilt phase of trial. Appellant specifically complains about a comment the\n\nprosecutor made after going through the party language in the charge:\n\n      PROSECUTOR: We ask you to find him guilty as a party because\n      what we believed happened is the defendant directed and\n      encouraged—\n\n      DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection to putting beliefs into the\n      argument, Your Honor. It’s improper.\n\n      THE COURT: That will be overruled.\n\n      PROSECUTOR: What the evidence supports is that the defendant\n      directed and encouraged Roger to kill the little boy. (RR XXIII 92).\n\n      Appellant complains the State’s argument went outside the record and\n\ninvited the jury to consider the prosecutor’s opinion. A prosecutor may not inject\n\nher personal opinion in statements to the jury or imply a special expertise about a\n\ncontested factual matter. Johnson v. State, 698 S.W.2d 154, 167 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1985). But it is well settled that the prosecutor may argue her opinion concerning\n\nissues in the case so long as the opinion is based on the evidence in the record and\n\n\n\n                                        46\n\fdoes not constitute unsworn testimony. McKay v. State, 707 S.W.2d 23, 37 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1985). And a prosecutor has some leeway to respond to particular\n\npoints made in defense counsel’s closing. Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 115 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2000).\n\n      Prior to this comment, defense counsel in closing argument stated, “And I\n\nhave to tell you, I don’t know what happened. I wasn’t there. The State wasn’t\n\nthere. You weren’t there. It’s a tough decision to try to reconstruct beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt what happened.” (RR XXIII 63). The prosecutor’s comment\n\nwas clearly a response to this argument and was the prosecutor’s opinion of the\n\nevidence presented in the trial. The prosecutor did not claim to possess any\n\nspecial expertise of knowledge outside of the record. Therefore, the trial court did\n\nnot err in overruling appellant’s objection.       See McKay, 707 S.W.2d at 37\n\n(prosecutor’s opinion of the evidence was not improper since the prosecutor\n\ndidn’t argue possession of any special expertise constituting unsworn testimony);\n\nsee also Wilson v. State, 938 S.W.2d 57, 60 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (the invited\n\nargument rule permits prosecutorial argument outside the record in response to\n\ndefense argument which goes outside the record).\n\n      Even assuming the comment was error, it was harmless because it did not\n\naffect appellant’s substantial rights. TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b); Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at\n\n259 (factors to consider include the severity of the misconduct, any curative\n\n\n                                         47\n\fmeasures and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct). When the\n\nprosecutor stated what she thought happened that night, she was in essence\n\ntelling the jury the State’s theory of the case with regard to party liability.3\n\nAlthough there was no curative instruction, the prosecutor immediately re-\n\nphrased her argument, “What the evidence supports is that the defendant directed\n\nand encouraged Roger to kill the little boy.” (RR XXIII 92). See Zarate v. State, 908\n\nS.W.2d 544, 549-550 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1995, pet. ref’d) (prosecutor’s\n\nreferences in closing argument regarding her personal opinion were harmless\n\nbecause she immediately abandoned the line of reasoning when an objection was\n\nmade).\n\n       It is unlikely the use of the words “we believe” in this isolated instance\n\ninfluenced the jury in such a manner to question appellant’s conviction, based\n\nupon the wealth of evidence supporting his guilt. See Allen v. State, 149 S.W.3d 254,\n\n261 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet. ref’d) (prosecutor’s improper act of\n\ninjecting his personal opinion during closing argument was harmless where\n\nevidence of defendant’s guilt was ample).\n\n       Appellant’s ninth issue should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    It is common for practitioners to use terms like “I believe, we believe” and inadvertently\nprovide their opinion when they are really just summarizing the evidence. Defense counsel did\nit twice during closing argument at the punishment phase. (RR XXVI 116, 130).\n\n\n                                             48\n\fTenth & Eleventh Points of Error\n\n      In his tenth issue, appellant similarly complains the prosecutor went\n\noutside the record and injected her personal belief during her closing argument in\n\nthe punishment phase. The prosecutor summarized the evidence demonstrating\n\nappellant ordered Aviles-Barroso (Roger) to kill Adam:\n\n      PROSECUTOR: Who is orchestrating this deal? Who is\n      orchestrating all the criminal conduct that he’s involved in from all of\n      the evidence that you’ve heard? Him. He is the boss. And that’s why\n      when he told Roger to stab that little boy, he did. And Roger will pay\n      the price for that when his turn comes, but don’t take the blame off of\n      the man who told him to do it. Don’t excuse him. Because I will tell you\n      right now, if it were up to Roger alone, Angelo would still be alive. (RR XXVI\n      163-164) (emphasis added).\n\n      Defense counsel objected the last line of that passage was outside of\n\nthe record. (RR XXVI 164-165). The trial court overruled his objection but\n\ninstructed the prosecutor to clear up her argument. (RR XXVI 165). The\n\nprosecutor complied:\n\n      PROSECUTOR: What I’m saying to you is, is that the defendant was\n      the boss. The defendant told Roger to kill the little boy… And without\n      hesitation, he got out of the car and opened the door and he told\n      Roger in Spanish: You know what you have to do. And guess what?\n      Roger did it. (RR XXVI 165-166).\n\n      Appellant’s tenth point of error is waived. To complain on appeal about\n\nimproper jury argument, appellant must “show that he objected and pursued his\n\nobjection to an adverse ruling.” Cockrell v. State, 933 S.W.2d 73, 89 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1996). Prior to the passage appellant complains of in his tenth point of error, the\n\n\n                                           49\n\fother prosecutor made virtually the same argument during closing argument and\n\nappellant failed to object.\n\n      PROSECUTOR: You can answer based on what you know in the\n      facts and evidence that Obel Cruz-Garcia is responsible for Angelo’s\n      death. But for Obel Cruz-Garcia, don’t you know that Angelo Garcia, Jr. would\n      be alive. Baby Angelo would be here but for Obel Cruz-Garcia. (RR XXVI 153)\n      (emphasis added).\n\n      Appellant has waived this argument because he failed to object to all the\n\nalleged objectionable arguments. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); Fuentes v. State, 991 S.W.2d\n\n267, 273 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (a defendant must object each time the\n\nimpermissible argument is made, or the complaint is waived); Wilson v. State, 179\n\nS.W.3d 240, 249 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2005, no pet.) (same).\n\n      Even assuming the issue was preserved, the argument was proper as a\n\nreasonable deduction from the evidence. Counsel is allowed wide latitude in\n\ndrawing inferences from evidence so long as they are reasonable, fair, legitimate\n\nand offered in good faith. McFarland v. State, 845 S.W.2d 824, 840 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1992). Further, even if the prosecutor’s statements could be construed as stating\n\nher opinion, a prosecutor may argue her opinions concerning issues in the case so\n\nlong as the opinions are based on the evidence in the record and do not constitute\n\nunsworn testimony. Penry v. State, 903 S.W.2d 715, 756 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\n\n      The jury learned from Santana, Diana and Linda Hernandez that appellant\n\nwas the leader of the drug operation and everyone took direction from him.\n\n\n                                           50\n\fEvidence at trial demonstrated that appellant physically carried Adam out of the\n\napartment that night. Santana tried to convince appellant to take Adam back\n\ninside, but he would not. There was absolutely no evidence that Santana or\n\nAviles-Barroso wanted to kidnap or kill Adam.\n\n      Appellant choose the location for Adam’s death and burial. He drove his co-\n\nconspirators and Adam to Baytown and once in a secluded area, gave the order for\n\nAviles-Barroso to kill Adam. Appellant directed Santana and Aviles-Barroso to put\n\nAdam’s body back in the car, and he drove to another rural area and instructed\n\nthem to submerge Adam’s body in the river.\n\n      The evidence revealed not only was appellant the leader of the drug ring, he\n\norchestrated the burglary, as well as Adam’s kidnapping and murder.             The\n\nprosecutor’s argument — that appellant is the reason Adam is dead — whether a\n\nreasonable deduction of the evidence or the prosecutor’s opinion of the evidence,\n\nwas not improper. See Garcia v. State, 246 S.W.3d 121, 145 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2007, pet. ref’d) (prosecutor’s statement regarding personal belief of guilt was\n\nbased upon the evidence and thus, not improper); Carlock v. State, 8 S.W.3d 717, 725-\n\n726 (Tex. App.—Waco 1999, pet. ref’d) (prosecution’s arguments were properly\n\nbased on reasonable deductions from evidence and did not improperly invite jury\n\nto speculate). Appellant’s tenth point of error should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f         In his eleventh issue, appellant complains the trial court erred by denying\n\nhis motion for mistrial based upon improper jury argument during the punishment\n\nphase.\n\n         PROSECUTOR: What else? They want to minimize the escape\n         attempt. Justin talked to you about that. What do you think\n         happened after he attempted to escape? You think he might have\n         wound up in administrative segregation. I bet he did. (RR XXVI 171).\n\n         The defense attorney objected this was outside the record and the trial court\n\nagreed. (RR XXVI 171-172). The trial judge sustained the objection and instructed\n\nthe jury to disregard the last statement made by the prosecutor. (RR XXVI 171-\n\n172). Appellant moved for a mistrial which was denied. (RR XXVI 172).\n\n         A mistrial is the trial court’s remedy for improper conduct that is “so\n\nprejudicial that expenditure of further time and expense would be wasteful and\n\nfutile.” Hawkins v. State, 135 S.W.3d 72, 76 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Only in extreme\n\ncircumstances, where the prejudice is incurable, will a mistrial be required. Id. at\n\n77. When the trial court sustains an objection and grants an instruction to\n\ndisregard, but denies the motion for mistrial, the proper issue to address is\n\nwhether the refusal to grant the mistrial was an abuse of discretion on the part of\n\nthe trial court. Id. at 76-77. The question of whether a mistrial for improper\n\nargument should have been granted involves most, if not all, of the same\n\nconsiderations that attend a harm analysis. Id. at 77.\n\n\n\n\n                                           52\n\f      In determining whether improper jury argument warrants a mistrial, three\n\nfactors should be evaluated: 1) severity of the misconduct (the magnitude of the\n\nprejudicial effect of the prosecutor’s remarks); 2) measures adopted to cure the\n\nmisconduct (the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge); and 3) the\n\ncertainty of conviction absent the misconduct (the strength of the evidence\n\nsupporting the conviction). Ramon v. State, 159 S.W.3d 927, 929 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2004), citing Mosley, 983 S.W.2d at 259.       Since the argument occurred at\n\npunishment, this Court analyzes the third factor with regard to the certainty of\n\nthe punishment assessed. Martinez, 17 S.W.3d at 693.\n\n      An officer from the Department of Corrections and Correctional Institution\n\nof Guayama, Puerto Rico testified about appellant’s escape attempt while he was\n\nincarcerated on October 10, 2003. (RR XXIV 118-128).         He mentioned that\n\nafterward, during the investigation of the escape attempt, appellant was\n\ninterviewed, and after he provided no information, the classification committee\n\ndetermined his punishment would be another type of custody. (RR XXIV 128).\n\nWhen appellant was booked into the Harris County Jail on February 12, 2010, he\n\nwas place into administrative segregation, as a high-risk inmate. (RR XXV 145).\n\n      The complained-of passage was a small part of the prosecutor’s closing\n\nargument. The comment likely had little or no prejudicial effect. The jury was\n\naware of appellant’s escape attempt and inmate classification. The only possible\n\n\n                                       53\n\fnew fact was whether he had been punished for the escape attempt. With regard\n\nto curative measures, the trial judge sustained appellant’s objection and gave a\n\nprompt curative instruction telling the jury to disregard the State’s remark. See\n\nLadd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 567 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (the appellate court should\n\npresume the jury followed the instruction to disregard).\n\n      In support of special issue number 1 — whether appellant would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society —\n\nthe State presented evidence that appellant committed several other violent\n\ncrimes, including the murder of Saul Flores, the attempted murder of Manuel\n\nButen, the aggravated kidnapping of Andres Buten, the aggravated kidnapping of\n\nWilliam Martinez, the burglary and assault of Patiko as well as the sexual assault\n\nof his girlfriend. In light of this powerful evidence, it is unlikely a comment\n\nregarding appellant’s punishment for an escape attempt affected the jury’s\n\ncertainty on the punishment of death.\n\n      Given the brevity of the prosecutor’s comment, the lack of prejudice, the\n\ncurative measures, and the strength of the evidence supporting appellant’s\n\nsentence, appellant has not shown the trial court abuse its discretion in denying\n\nhis motion for mistrial. See Green v. State, No. AP-76458, 2012 WL 4673756 *33\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (not designated for publication) (trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying defendant’s motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor’s\n\n\n                                        54\n\fimproper remarks during closing argument regarding the defendant’s prison\n\ndisciplinary problems that were outside the record in the punishment phase of a\n\ncapital murder death case, noting the trial court sustained defense counsel’s\n\nobjection to the testimony and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony).\n\n      Appellant’s eleventh point of error should be overruled.\n\n                        \n\n\n                  REPLY TO APPELLANT’S TWELFTH ISSUE\n\n      In his final point of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in denying\n\nhis motion for new trial. (CR 569-577).\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      Appellant contends his motion for new trial should have been granted due\n\nto jury misconduct, specifically evidence of an outside influence during the\n\npunishment deliberations. See TEX. R. APP. P. 21.3; White v. State, 225 S.W.3d 571\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (setting out three grounds for jury misconduct that can\n\npotentially get a defendant a new trial: 1) deciding a verdict unfairly; 2) receiving\n\nother evidence, unauthorized conversation, or being intoxicated while\n\ndeliberating; or 3) depriving the defendant of a fair trial).\n\n      Appellant complained of jury misconduct, in that one juror, Angela\n\nBowman, felt undue pressure to return her verdict, and the jury foreman, Matthew\n\nClinger, read Bible scriptures in the jury room, which constituted an outside\n\n\n                                           55\n\finfluence. (RR XXIX 4, 12, 22-26). In support of his allegations, appellant offered\n\nthree affidavits: one from his trial attorney Mario Madrid, defense investigator J.J.\n\nGradoni, and jury member Angela Bowman. (CR 569-577; RR XXXV 28-36;\n\nDefense Exhibit Numbers 1, 2 & 3).\n\n      The State responded the affidavits were not admissible under Rule 606(b),\n\nand even if they were, they did not demonstrate any conversation about the Bible\n\nunduly influenced the jury, and the State offered affidavits in response to that\n\nissue. (RR XXIX 11-18; RR XXXV 3-9; State’s Exhibit Numbers 1 & 2).\n\n      After review of appellant’s motion and the affidavits, the trial court denied\n\nappellant’s motion for new trial. (RR XXIX 28). The court admitted appellant’s\n\nthree affidavits into evidence, as well as two provided by the State, but noted:\n\n      “And I find obviously by making those — by finding those affidavits\n      are admissible that there is enough question as to whether this Bible\n      production or Bible reading, whatever occurred, may be an outside\n      influence. I’m not of the opinion that it was based on everything\n      that’s been provided to me in the case law, but we’re going to send it\n      up and see if the Court of Appeals — Court of Criminal Appeals\n      agrees with us on that.\n\n      And so, based on that I’m not granting the Motion For New Trial.”\n      (RR XXIX 28).\n\n      This Court reviews a trial court’s denial of a motion for new trial for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Salazar v. State, 38 S.W.3d 141, 148 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). In\n\nconducting this review, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\n\ntrial court; rather, it should decide only whether the trial court’s decision was\n\n\n                                         56\n\farbitrary or unreasonable. Holden v. State, 201 S.W.3d 761, 763 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2006). A trial court abuses its discretion in denying a motion for new trial only\n\nwhen no reasonable view of the record could support the trial court’s ruling. Id.\n\n      A motion for new trial alleging jury misconduct must be supported by the\n\naffidavit of a juror or other person who is in a position to know the facts. Trout v.\n\nState, 702 S.W.2d 618, 620 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985). Texas Rule of Evidence 606(b)\n\nprohibits post-verdict testimony about events or statements that occurred during\n\njury deliberations, the jurors’ mental processes, or how an improper influence\n\naffected the jurors. TEX. R. EVID. 606(b); Colyer v. State, 428 S.W.3d 117, 123 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2014). It also prohibits such evidence by affidavit. Id. at 124. An\n\noutside influence about which a juror may testify includes a discussion originating\n\nfrom a source outside of the jury room and other than from the jurors themselves.\n\nMcQuarrie v. State, 380 S.W.3d 145, 154 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n\nMotion For New Trial Evidence\n\n      On July 19, 2013, the jury was in the second day of punishment deliberations.\n\n(RR XXVI 176-178; RR XXVII 3-14). At approximately 3:20 p.m., jury member\n\nAngela Bowman sent a note asking to speak to the trial judge. (CR 512). The trial\n\njudge allowed this jury member to speak to her in the privacy of her chambers,\n\nwithin the presence of the court reporter. (RR XXVII 3-4).\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f      When the trial judge asked Bowman what she needed to relay to the court,\n\nBowman replied that she could not agree with other jurors on the special issues\n\nand felt pressured. (RR XXVII 4-5). Bowman urged the judge to allow an\n\nalternate to take her place. (RR XXVII 5). The judge educated Bowman on the\n\nlaw in this regard, and Bowman replied that the jury was never going to come to\n\nan agreement. (RR XXVII 6). Bowman also stated that she did not want to have\n\nto stay another night. (RR XXVII 8). The judge instructed her to resume her\n\ndeliberations with the jury until otherwise directed by the court. (RR XXVII 6-8).\n\nBowman returned to the jury room and the jury returned its punishment verdict\n\non all three special issues at approximately 4:30 p.m. (CR 523-527).\n\n      One of appellant’s trial attorneys, Mario Madrid, provided an affidavit\n\nwhere he summarized a conversation he had with Bowman later that night.\n\n(Defense Exhibit Number 1).         He stated Bowman was distraught over the\n\npunishment deliberations and claimed she was pressured into changing her\n\ndecision. Id. She explained her decision was complicated by the fact that her\n\ndaughter was ill and she was unable to attend to her due to sequestration. Id.\n\nBowman also stated the jury foreman quoted from his Bible during the\n\ndeliberations, and she felt it influenced other jurors. Id.\n\n      Angela Bowman provided an affidavit as well and expanded on what she\n\ninitially told the trial judge and Mario Madrid. (Defense Exhibit Number 3).\n\n\n                                           58\n\fBowman claimed she received a phone call from her daughter’s camp counselor on\n\nthe first day of deliberations, July 18, 2013. Id. In her affidavit, she claims her\n\ndaughter had a fever and stated, “If it had not been for my concern over my\n\ndaughter’s health condition, I would have remained committed to voting for life in\n\nprison.” Id. She also noted that the jury foreman took out his Bible when another\n\njuror, Casey Guillotte, sought spiritual guidance to make her decision.            Id.\n\nBowman did not claim the act of referencing the Bible caused her to change her\n\ndecision, she was clear, “I changed my verdict so I could go home and take care of\n\nmy child.” Id.\n\n      The defense also submitted an affidavit from their investigator, J.J. Gradoni.\n\n(Defense Exhibit Number 2). His statement substantiates much of what was\n\nincluded in the affidavits provided by Mario Madrid and Angela Bowman. Id. He\n\nalso added that he interviewed the jury foreman, Matthew Clinger, who admitted\n\nhe pulled out his personal Bible during deliberations and read from it. Id. Clinger\n\nshared the fact that he looked to his Bible for spiritual guidance with Casey\n\nGuillotte. Id.\n\n      The State presented two affidavits in its response to appellant’s motion for\n\nnew trial, in the alternative, if the trial court ruled the affidavits were admissible\n\nunder Rule 609(b). (RR XXIX 11).\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f      The first was from Casey Guillotte. (States’ Exhibit Number 1). She stated\n\nthe jury came back on the first two special issues unanimously, then turned to the\n\nthird special issue—whether there was sufficient mitigation evidence to warrant\n\nlife in prison rather than the death penalty. Id. She said at this point, she asked the\n\nentire jury about how each of them would come to terms with the verdict, from an\n\nemotional standpoint. Id. Guillotte stated in response to her question, Clinger\n\nretrieved his personal Bible from his belongings and read a passage to himself. Id.\n\nHe told her he found comfort with his decision because of a verse in the book of\n\nRomans. Id. She stated Clinger did not read the Bible to the jury or direct any of\n\nthem to a particular passage, and it not influence her decision. Id.\n\n      The State also presented an affidavit from Matthew Clinger, the jury\n\nforeman. (State’s Exhibit Number 2). He recalled when deciding the three special\n\nissues, the jury agreed to focus their discussions on the facts and not emotions. Id.\n\nClinger remembered that Casey Guillotte, while staying true to this intention,\n\nwondered aloud how they would all deal with the aftermath of their verdict. Id.\n\nSeveral of the jurors shared how they dealt with their emotions and he told\n\nGuillotte he found comfort in the Bible. Id. Although he pulled out his Bible for\n\nhimself, he did not read from it aloud, nor did Guillotte read it.            Id. He\n\ncharacterized the conversation as sharing advice for coping with the emotional\n\nramifications of their decision. Id.\n\n                                          60\n\fAnalysis\n\n      The record reveals the trial court admitted the affidavits in an abundance of\n\ncaution, but held the belief the affidavits were not admissible under Rule 606(b).\n\nThe judge specifically stated that she did not think a Bible production or Bible\n\nreading (which ever occurred) constituted an “outside influence.” (RR XXIX 28).\n\nThis is legally correct based on the facts of this case.\n\n      This Court has considered the term “outside influence” when evaluating\n\nwhether evidence from jurors is admissible in a motion for new trial under Rule\n\n606(b). In 2012, this Court decided McQuarrie v. State; the defendant in that case\n\nwas charged with sexual assault and he maintained it was consensual sex,\n\nalthough the victim claimed she was drugged. McQuarrie, 380 S.W.3d at 147-148,\n\n150-155. After one day of deliberating, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous\n\nverdict, so they resumed deliberations the following day. Id. at 148. The next day,\n\none of the jurors shared information with the rest of the jury concerning internet\n\nresearch he performed the night before, on the effects of date rape drugs, pertinent\n\nto the case. Id. In holding the internet research qualified as an outside influence\n\nfor which the defendant should have been permitted to conduct a post-trial\n\ninquiry, this Court stated, “A Rule 606(b) inquiry is limited to that which occurs\n\noutside the jury room and outside of the juror’s personal knowledge and\n\nexperience.” Id. at 153.\n\n\n                                           61\n\f      In 2014, this Court clarified that personal pressures—such as fear of\n\ninclement weather or concern about a child’s illness—are not “outside influences\n\nunder Rule 606(b). See Colyer, 428 S.W.3d at 119. Juror testimony on these subjects\n\nis not admissible to show jury misconduct. Id. at 127-128 (rejecting defense\n\ncontention that weather and a call from child’s doctor constitute information\n\noutside the jury room, since these are influences unrelated to the trial issues);\n\ncompare McQuarrie, 380 S.W.3d at 154-155.\n\n      A collective reading of this authority demonstrates why the affidavits in this\n\ncase are not admissible to show an “outside influence” under Rule 606(b). (CR\n\n12). First, Bowman never asserted the bible reading affected her decision. She\n\nclaimed the stress over her daughter’s illness caused her to change her vote. This\n\nfalls squarely within the holding of Colyer and her affidavit should not be\n\nadmissible in support of appellant’s new trial. See Colyer, 428 S.W.3d at 127-128\n\n(rejecting defendant’s interpretation of “outside influence,” which could include a\n\njuror that has second thoughts about his vote and then retroactively claim that a\n\npersonal pressure, such as his job, marriage, or children, made him apprehensive\n\nand eager to conclude the deliberations).\n\n      And the religious conversation in the jury room was characterized as one of\n\ncomfort, from one jury member to another, on dealing with the emotions of\n\nparticipating in this trial and assessing a difficult punishment. The foreman did\n\n\n                                        62\n\fnot read the Bible out loud to the jury, but to himself. It was not a source of new\n\nevidence pertaining to the issues in this case, as in McQuarrie. It was the foreman’s\n\npersonal belief that he shared during deliberations, which is not a permissible\n\nchallenge to the verdict. See Hines v. State, 3 S.W.3d 618, 623 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n\n1999, pet. ref’d) (a juror’s injection of his own personal experiences, knowledge, or\n\nexpertise is not considered an “outside influence,” because those representations\n\nemanate from inside the jury). And even assuming the record demonstrated the\n\nforeman was using his religious beliefs to coerce other jurors, it does not\n\nconstitute an “outside influence.” Id. (coercive influence of one juror on the rest of\n\nthe panel does not constitute an “outside influence”).\n\n      Therefore, the defense affidavits relating to this incident are not admissible\n\nunder Rule 606(b) to support his motion for new trial. Compare Oliver v. Quaterman,\n\n541 F.3d 329, 340 (5th 2008) (jury’s Bible consultation as a group constituted an\n\nexternal influence on deliberations where the jury did not simply discuss their\n\nown understanding of religious law and morality or merely quote the Bible, but\n\ninstead compared the facts of their case to a specific passage in the Bible that\n\ntaught capital punishment was appropriate for murder).\n\n      Even assuming the affidavits are admissible in this case, appellant has not\n\nshown the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new trial. In\n\n2008, this Court decided Lucero v. State; the defendant in that case was charged\n\n\n                                         63\n\fwith capital murder and claimed on appeal he was entitled to a new trial because\n\nthe jury foreman read scripture from the Bible during punishment deliberations.\n\nLucero v. State, 246 S.W.3d 86 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Evidence in that case\n\nrevealed that the jury foreman read a passage from the Bible that lasted\n\napproximately 2-3 minutes during the hours-long deliberations. Id. at 92. This\n\nCourt declined to decide whether the jury foreman’s reading of the Bible was an\n\n“outside influence,” and denied the defendant’s motion for new trial because the\n\naffidavits were devoid of any evidence that the scripture reading affected the jury’s\n\npunishment verdict of death. Id. at 95.\n\n       The affidavits in this case similarly contain no evidence that references to\n\nthe Bible affected any juror’s punishment decision.4 (State’s Exhibit Number 1;\n\nDefense Exhibit Number 3). Thus, appellant has not shown he should have been\n\ngranted a new trial, even when considering this evidence. See Oliver, 541 F.3d at\n\n341-344 (jury’s decision to impose the death penalty, despite the fact they\n\nconsulted an external influence, was harmless due to evidence from the jurors that\n\nit did not prejudice their decision).\n4\n  Appellant also claims the trial court erred by not having a hearing on his motion. (Appellant’s\nbrief 114-115). The defense was asked specifically about any other evidence that would show a\njuror was influenced by the bible reference, and he acknowledged there was nothing more than\nthe affidavits presented. (RR XXIX 24). Lucero is instructive on this issue, finding the lack of\nevidence from any juror showing the bible reading affected their verdict supported the trial\ncourt’s decision not to hold a hearing. Lucero, 246 S.W.3d at 94-95; see also Wallace v. State, 106\nS.W.3d 103, 108 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his\nmotion for new trial if the motion and accompanying affidavits raise matters not determinable\nfrom the record, upon which the accused would be entitled to relief).\n\n\n                                                64\n\f      Appellant’s twelfth point of error should be overruled. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n21.3; Tate v. State, 414 S.W.3d 260, 264 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no\n\npet.) (mere showing of outside influence, by jury’s foreman research of defendant’s\n\ncriminal history, was insufficient to establish juror misconduct, where the record\n\ncontained no evidence that this knowledge affected the jury’s decision).\n\n\n                        \n\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      It is respectfully submitted that this Court affirm appellant’s conviction and\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n                                               DEVON ANDERSON\n                                               District Attorney\n                                               Harris County, Texas\n\n\n\n                                               /s/   Jessica Akins\n                                              JESSICA AKINS\n                                              Assistant District Attorney\n                                              Harris County, Texas\n                                              1201 Franklin, Suite 600\n                                              Houston, Texas 77002\n                                              (713) 755-5826\n                                              TBC No. 24029415\n                                              akins_jessica@dao.hctx.net\n\n\n\n\n                                        65\n\f                           CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n      This is to certify that a copy of the foregoing instrument has been mailed to\n\nthe following address:\n\n      Wayne T.

R. APP. P. 39.7, the State only requests oral argument if this\n\nCourt deems it necessary. Appellant waived argument on the front cover of his\n\nbrief and within his brief.\n\n                         \n\n\n                              STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      Appellant was charged by indictment with the offense of capital murder.\n\n(CR 2-3). The indictment alleges appellant intentionally killed Adam while in the\n\ncourse of committing kidnapping on September 30, 1992. (CR 2-3; RR XVII 17-18).\n\nTEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 19.03(a)(2)(West 2013).\n\n      After finding appellant guilty of the charged offense, the jury answered the\n\npunishment special issues in a manner mandating the imposition of the death\n\npenalty.

After Arturo lost his job, he began\n\nselling drugs out of their apartment to support the family. (RR XVIII 127-128, 197-\n\n199). When Diana found out, she was unhappy, but ended up helping him since he\n\ncould not find work. (RR XVIII 128, 198).\n\n      Appellant supplied the drugs to Arturo and Diana; they knew him as\n\n“Chico.” (RR XVIII 128-129, 141, 167, 172, 177, 199-201; RR XX 84, 93; State’s\n\nExhibit Number 83). They also knew one of his associates, Carmelo Martinez\n\nSantana, who went by the name “Rudy.” (RR XVIII 138, 142; RR XX 85; RR XXI\n\n39; State’s Exhibit Number 85). The family knew both of them very well, and\n\nDiana even leased an apartment for appellant and his wife Angelita because they\n\nhad credit issues. (RR XVIII 135-138, 201-202; RR XIX 11; RR XX 93-94; State’s\n\nExhibit Number 42). Although they were close friends, Diana and others noted\n\nthat appellant was a strong person, the leader of the drug operation and everyone\n\nin the group took direction from him. (RR XVIII 138-139; RR XIX 152-155; RR XX\n\n123). Two to three weeks prior to the offense, Diana and Arturo decided to stop\n\nselling drugs for appellant, and he was not happy about it. (RR XVIII 133-134,\n\n203-204).\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      On the evening of September 30, 1992, shortly before midnight, the couple\n\nwas awakened to a loud noise; the front door of their apartment was kicked in.\n\n(RR XVIII 47-48, 69, 149, 206-207; RR XIX 58; State’s Exhibit Number 11). Arturo\n\ngot out of bed and encountered a tall masked man holding a gun. (RR XVIII 149-\n\n151, 208-209; RR XIX 34). This man gave them both instructions; he forced Diana\n\non the bed and tied up Arturo with the alarm clock cord. (RR XVIII 74, 77, 152-\n\n153, 158-160, 210-212). He repeatedly kicked Arturo and hit him over the head with\n\nthe handgun until he was knocked unconscious. (RR XVIII 153-158, 212-213; RR\n\nXIX 77).\n\n      A second gunman entered the room, tied up Diana and sexually assaulted\n\nher. (RR XVIII 78, 157-158, 210, 212, 214). Diana testified she knew the assailant\n\nejaculated because she felt a substance between her legs. (RR XVIII 165). Adam\n\nwas lying on a pallet on the floor and Diana heard him crying while she was being\n\nraped and Arturo was being assaulted. (RR XVIII 146, 155, 158). After the sexual\n\nassault, the two men ransacked the bedroom and left the apartment. (RR XVIII\n\n160-162; State’s Exhibit Numbers 20, 23, 24, 27 & 28). Soon after, Diana realized\n\nAdam was no longer in the apartment and went outside; her neighbor called the\n\npolice to report the sexual assault and kidnapping. (RR XVIII 163-164).\n\n      The couple needed immediate medical attention; Arturo suffered injuries to\n\nthe back of his head and Diana went to the hospital for a sexual assault exam. (RR\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fXVIII 51-52, 89, 163, 165, 217; RR XIX 57). SANE nurse Gloria Kologinczok\n\nperformed a sexual assault examination of Diana at 3:45 a.m. on October 1, 1992 at\n\nSt. Joseph’s Hospital in Houston. (RR XIX 41-50; State’s Exhibit Number 33). At\n\n4:25 a.m., she turned over the evidence collection kit, which included panties,\n\nvaginal swabs, a known saliva sample and a known blood sample, to HPD Officer\n\nBredemeyer. (RR XIX 49-50, 58-59; State’s Exhibit Numbers 33A, 33B, 33C &\n\n33D). Bredemeyer maintained custody of the evidence and transported it to the\n\nHPD property room. (RR XIX 59-60). A cigar found in the apartment that did not\n\nbelong to Diana or Arturo was collected as evidence. (RR XVIII 80-82).\n\n      Diana was unable to give a description of the second man who raped her, as\n\nshe did not see his face or hear his voice. (RR XVIII 162). But she described the\n\nfirst man, the tall one who assaulted her husband. (RR XVIII 98-99, 101-102). She\n\nrecalled he had a dark complexion and spoke in the Spanish language, but with a\n\nforeign accent, not a Hispanic accent that one would hear in Mexico. (RR XVIII\n\n99, 152). Arturo described it as a Central American accent. (RR XVIII 211).\n\n      Police learned from neighbors that Diana and Arturo had recently been\n\nselling drugs out of their apartment. (RR XVIII 56). Believing this was crucial to\n\nthe investigation of Adam’s kidnapping, Officer Hernandez interviewed both\n\nDiana and Arturo. (RR XIX 65-67). They initially denied being involved with\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fdrugs, but later admitted their involvement and told authorities appellant was\n\ntheir drug supplier. (RR XVIII 166-167, 199, 218; RR XIX 65-75).\n\n      The FBI initially suspected appellant in the abduction of Adam, but learned\n\nhe fled the country soon after the offense. (RR XIX 135-139, 144-145; XX 98-100).\n\nWhen appellant’s wife Angelita learned about Adam’s abduction on the news, she\n\nwas shocked. (RR XX 96). She recalled appellant did not have an appropriate\n\nreaction and then abruptly informed her he was going to Puerto Rico. (RR XX 96-\n\n100, 102-103).\n\n      HPD Sergeant Swaim went to appellant’s apartment on October 6, 1992.\n\n(RR XIX 184-185). At the apartment, Swaim encountered a Hispanic man who\n\nidentified himself as Candido Lebron. (RR XIX 185-186; State’s Exhibit Number\n\n84). Swaim interviewed him, but doubted his identity because the man could not\n\nprovide the name of his parents that were listed on the birth certificate he\n\nprovided. (RR XIX 186). Swaim later learned the man’s true identity was Rogelio\n\nAviles-Barroso, appellant’s co-defendant in this case. (RR XIX 186-187; RR XX\n\n130-131; RR XXI 88-89; State’s Exhibit Number 84).\n\n      More than a month after the abduction, on November 5, 1992, the body of a\n\nyoung boy was found in Baytown. (RR XVIII 91-92, 218-219; RR XIX 191-192; RR\n\nXXI 86). Dental records confirmed the identity as Adam and the manner of death\n\nwas ruled a homicide. (RR XVIII 92; RR XIX 205; XX 4-15, 24-25). Although his\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fremains were skeletal by that time, Adam was still wearing the Batman pajamas he\n\nhad gone to bed in on September 30, 1992. (RR XVIII 92, 168-169; RR XIX 193-194,\n\n202-204; State’s Exhibit Numbers 48, 51 & 61).\n\n      Approximately one month after Adam’s body was found, Angelita\n\nRodriguez traveled to Puerto Rico. (RR XX 105). While there, she met with\n\nappellant and told him she wanted a divorce. (RR XX 105-106). Appellant told\n\nAngelita he would not agree to a divorce and threated to harm her family. (RR XX\n\n106-107).   Angelita asked appellant if he had anything to do with Adam’s\n\ndisappearance and appellant admitted he killed Adam. (RR XX 107).\n\n      Several years passed and the case went unsolved. In 2007, as part of a cold\n\ncase investigation, HPD Sergeant Mehl reviewed the case file and located\n\nappellant in Puerto Rico. (RR XX 37-43, 49). A sample of appellant’s DNA was\n\nobtained and compared to the sexual assault kit and cigar left at the crime scene;\n\nanalysis revealed appellant was the man who raped Diana in 1992. (RR XX 44-52,\n\n55, 72-78; RR XXI 92-93, 105-107, 109, 117-120, 156-157, 160-162, 168; State’s Exhibit\n\nNumbers 32, 33, 65, 66, 68, 76, 77 & 95).\n\n      When the case was re-opened, FBI Special Agent Eric Johnson located\n\nCarmelo Martinez Santana in a Pennsylvania prison. (RR XX 165-166, 176-178).\n\nAt the time of this trial, Santana was serving time on two federal convictions for\n\ndrug trafficking and weapons possession. (RR XX 118-119; RR XXI 18-19, 29-30).\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fWhen he interviewed Santana, FBI Special Agent William Ebersole gathered\n\nsignificantly more information than was previously known about Adam’s murder.\n\n(RR XX 175-183; RR XXI 11-14, 65-77).\n\n      Santana is Angelita’s cousin and moved from the Dominican Republic to\n\nPuerto Rico, and then to the United States in 1992 with Angelita and appellant.\n\n(RR XX 117-120). Santana came to the U.S. with appellant to work in the drug\n\nbusiness with him, selling cocaine. (RR XX 120-123). He was known to the\n\nparties in appellant’s drug ring as “Rudy.” (RR XX 116). Santana described\n\nappellant as a violent, controlling leader; one who was protective of his drug\n\nbusiness and became angry when his people wanted out of the business. (RR XX\n\n123-127). Santana testified appellant had once tied him up and threatened to kill\n\nhim when he thought Santana was taking drug clients from him. (RR XX 124).\n\n      Santana recalled on September 30, 1992, appellant wanted to go to Diana’s\n\napartment to look for drugs and money, so he and Aviles-Barroso accompanied\n\nappellant. (RR XX 135-137). Santana remained in the car while appellant and\n\nAviles-Barroso went inside the apartment. (RR XX 137-138). Both appellant and\n\nAviles-Barroso were wearing ski masks and possessed weapons; Santana recalled\n\nappellant had a gun and Aviles-Barroso had a knife. (RR XX 137-142; RR XXI 52).\n\n      Santana estimated they were in the apartment for approximately 30\n\nminutes. (RR XX 143). When they returned, Santana was surprised to see\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\fappellant holding a little boy in his arms. (RR XX 143-144). Santana immediately\n\nasked appellant why he had taken Adam and appellant replied that the child had\n\nseen his face and recognized him. (RR XX 144; State’s Exhibit Number 31).\n\nSantana was unsuccessful in trying to convince appellant to take Adam back\n\ninside to his mother. (RR XX 145-147). Appellant then admitted to Santana that\n\nhe raped Diana. (RR XX 145).\n\n      Appellant put Adam in the backseat of the vehicle and drove the group to\n\nBaytown. (RR XX 147-149). He stopped in a secluded area and they all got out of\n\nthe vehicle; appellant stated to Aviles-Barroso, “You already know what you have\n\nto do.” (RR XX 149-150; RR XXI 60). Santana immediately felt nauseous and\n\nbecame ill; he walked away from them and defecated in the woods. (RR XX 150;\n\nRR XXI 9). During this time, appellant followed Santana to see what he was\n\ndoing and Santana heard Adam scream and moan. (RR XX 150-151, 160). When\n\nSantana returned to the vehicle, he saw that Adam was dead and covered in blood\n\nthroughout his torso. (RR XX 151-152; RR XXI 10).\n\n      Appellant ordered Santana and Aviles-Barroso to put the body back into the\n\nvehicle and they obeyed. (RR XX 152). Appellant drove them to a rural area and\n\ninstructed them to throw the body in a nearby river. (RR XX 152-153). He further\n\ninstructed them to sink the child, so Santana and Aviles-Barroso gathered some\n\nrocks and placed them on top of the body. (RR XX 153-154).\n\n\n\n                                       8\n\f       Afterward, when they were driving back toward Pasadena, they had several\n\nflat tires.   (RR XX 154-155).    They called a friend Charlie for help with\n\ntransportation and appellant made Santana and Aviles-Barroso swear they would\n\nnever tell anyone what happened. (RR XIX 156-161, 172; RR XX 156; RR XXI 44,\n\n61). Charlie would not come get them, so they took a taxi to Charlie’s house to\n\nborrow a vehicle. (RR XIX 161-166; RR XX 156-157). Charlie’s girlfriend, Linda\n\nHernandez, recalled that Santana seemed extremely nervous. (RR XIX 163; RR\n\nXX 157). Appellant instructed Santana to get rid of the knife and told Santana he\n\nwas leaving town because of what he did that night. (RR XX 158-159, 166).\n\n       The following day, appellant changed the tires on his vehicle, washed out\n\nthe blood and sold it. (RR XX 160-162). Appellant used the money he got from\n\nthe car sale to buy a plane ticket out of the country. (RR XX 162). Santana took\n\nappellant to the airport and never saw him again. (RR XX 162, 164).\n\n       16 years after Adam’s death, capital murder charges were filed against\n\nappellant and Rogelio Aviles-Barroso. (RR XX 55-56; RR XXI 91). After the jury\n\nfound appellant guilty of capital murder, they heard evidence that appellant\n\ncommitted multiple other violent crimes, demonstrating he is a continuing threat\n\nto society. (CR 506, 523).\n\n       Carmelo Martinez Santana testified during the punishment phase to shed\n\nlight on appellant’s actions prior to Adam’s murder. (RR XXV 59-89). Santana\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\fdescribed appellant’s behavior when appellant believed Santana was stealing his\n\nmoney and drug customers. Appellant tied him up, threw him in a bathtub,\n\ngagged him and threatened to kill him, until Santana gave him money and\n\npromised never to betray him. (RR XXV 61-64).\n\n      Santana relayed another incident where appellant sought retribution\n\nagainst a drug competitor, a man named Patiko. (RR XXV 65-71). In a distinctly\n\nsimilar manner to the charged offense, appellant, Santana and another man broke\n\ninto Patiko’s apartment. (RR XXV 66-69). Santana waited in the car while\n\nappellant and the other man went inside to burglarize the apartment. (RR XXV\n\n69). When they returned 20 minutes later, they were carrying drugs and money.\n\n(RR XXV 69-70). Appellant told Santana that he had tied up and beaten Patiko\n\nand then raped his girlfriend. (RR XXV 70-71). Santana recalled when he spent\n\ntime with appellant, they frequently burglarized people in the drug business. (RR\n\nXXV 71).\n\n      In July of 1989, appellant kidnapped and killed a drug associate named Saul\n\nFlores. (RR XXV 22-33, 72-85, 99, 121; State’s Exhibit Number 122). Appellant\n\nlearned that Saul was interested in his girlfriend, Elizabeth Ramos, and became\n\ninfuriated. (RR XXV 49-50, 74-75). Appellant, Santana and a man named Robert\n\nwent over to Elizabeth’s apartment where they found Saul. (RR XXV 75-76).\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\fThey grabbed him, put him in their car and transported him to a drug apartment\n\non Winkler where they sold drugs. (RR XXV 76-77).\n\n      Appellant tied up Saul and began beating him. (RR XXV 79). Appellant\n\nrepeatedly hit Saul with a hammer and injected him with drugs. (RR XXV 80-81,\n\n93-94). Santana saw appellant get on top of Saul and apply pressure to his neck\n\nuntil he died. (RR XXV 81-82). Appellant instructed Santana to help him put\n\nSaul’s body in the bathtub and they left the apartment. (RR XXV 82-83).\n\n      Tina Perez, a friend of Elizabeth’s, went over to the apartment on Winkler\n\nlooking to buy some drugs. (RR XXV 24-30). The door was open, but no one was\n\nthere; she went inside and saw Saul’s body in the bathtub. (RR XXV 30-33).\n\nWhen appellant learned the police wanted to question Tina about Saul, he told\n\nher to keep quiet, and tell the police she had not seen anything. (RR XXV 32-35).\n\n      Soon after, appellant returned to the apartment with his drug associates and\n\nthey carried Saul’s body to the dumpster. (RR XXV 7-19, 84-85). An autopsy\n\nrevealed Saul had suffered multiple blunt force traumas, had cocaine in his blood\n\nand had been restrained and strangulated. (RR XXV 97-111).\n\n      In October of 2001, while in Puerto Rico, appellant attempted to kill a\n\nrestaurant business owner and kidnapped two men. (RR XXIV 14-42). Appellant\n\npointed a revolver at Manuel Buten and attempted to shoot him two times, but\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fluckily the gun did not fire and Buten was able to run away. (RR XXIV 23-25, 82-\n\n83, 102).\n\n      Buten later learned appellant had kidnapped two family members who\n\nworked at the restaurant, his brother Andres Buten and his step-son William\n\nMartinez, who was only 16. (RR XXIV 18, 20, 26, 83-97, 99, 102-106). Appellant\n\ncalled Buten and demanded a large amount of cocaine and cash in exchange for the\n\nsafe release of the two men. (RR XXIV 29-32, 47). Appellant threatened to kill\n\nthem if Buten called the police or failed to comply with his demands. (RR XXIV\n\n31, 37). With the assistance of law enforcement, Buten negotiated with appellant\n\nand he was apprehended. (RR XXIV 41, 48-58).\n\n      Agent Rodriguez convinced appellant to let the men go; while in custody\n\nappellant called his wife and instructed her to release Andres and William. (RR\n\nXXIV 58-60). Both of the men had been severely injured and were taken to the\n\nhospital. (RR XXIV 60, 95-96, 105-111).\n\n      Andres described how appellant treated him while he was confined. (RR\n\nXXIV 84-94). Andres was bound with wire from a coat hanger while appellant\n\nrepeatedly punched him, kicked him, hit him over the head with a shower curtain,\n\nhit his feet with a mallet and urinated on him.      (RR XXIV 86-90, 93-94).\n\nAppellant told Andres he was going to kill him. (RR XXIV 87). William testified\n\nappellant physically beat him as well; appellant threw him to the floor, stomped\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fon his back and spit on him. (RR XXIV 105-108). Appellant also hit William with\n\na revolver, tied him up with the wire from a coat hanger and held a knife to his\n\nthroat, toes and penis, threatening to cut him. (RR XXIV 109-110).\n\n      Appellant and his accomplices were charged with kidnapping and\n\npossession of weapons. (RR XXIV 64-65). Appellant pled guilty to the charges\n\nand was sentenced to 16 years confinement in Puerto Rico. (RR XXIV 65-67;\n\nState’s Exhibit Number 121). While incarcerated, an inspection of appellant’s cell\n\nrevealed his plans to escape, the window pane was loose and open to the outside\n\nand he had hidden a rope of bed sheets and a map of Puerto Rico. (RR XXIV 120-\n\n127). A cell phone was also found on his person, which is prohibited in a\n\ncorrectional facility. (RR XXIV 128).\n\n      Appellant continued to cause safety concerns while incarcerated in the\n\nUnited States. (XXV 134-135, 139-140). He was booked into the Harris County\n\nJail on February 12, 2010 and was classified as a high-risk inmate and placed into\n\nadministrative separation, where he remained for two years. (RR XXV 145). Two\n\nmonths after being moved from separation, on September 23, 2012, appellant\n\npossessed a prohibited weapon in a penal institution, by confiscating a razor blade\n\nand hiding it inside his bed. (XXV 126-133, 137-138, 145, 147).\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      After the presentment of punishment evidence, the jury answered the\n\nspecial issues in a manner mandating the imposition of the death penalty. (CR\n\n523-527; RR XXVIII 3-5).\n\n      In the first special issue, the jury unanimously found from the evidence\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt there is a probability that appellant would commit acts\n\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. (CR 523; RR\n\nXXVIII 3).\n\n      In the second special issue, the jury unanimously found from the evidence\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that appellant himself actually caused the death of\n\nAdam, on the occasion in question, or if he did not actually cause the death of\n\nAdam, that he intended to kill Adam, or that he anticipated that a human life\n\nwould be taken. (CR 524; RR XXVIII 3-4).\n\n      In the third special issue, the jury unanimously found, after taking into\n\nconsideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the\n\ndefendant’s character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the\n\ndefendant, that there was not sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that\n\na sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed. (CR\n\n525-526; RR XXVIII 4).\n\n      The trial court orally sentenced appellant to death.

None of the evidence admitted into evidence was tested by the\nHPD crime lab.\n\nReply to appellant’s second issue — Appellant’s confrontation complaints are\nnot preserved for this Court’s review because he did not make an objection at trial.\n\nReply to appellant’s third issue — The evidence is legally sufficient to support\nappellant’s conviction for capital murder. Appellant kidnapped a six-year old\nchild and ordered his accomplice to kill him.\n\nReply to appellant’s fourth and fifth issues — Appellant has not shown the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in admitting extraneous evidence of his bond forfeiture\nand failure to appear under Rules 403 and 404(b).\n\nReply to appellant sixth and seventh issues — Appellant has not shown the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding mitigation evidence regarding his\ncompletion of bible study or assistance to law enforcement because it constituted\nhearsay.\n\nReply to appellant’s eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh issues — Appellant has\nnot shown that closing argument by the prosecutor was impermissible, or that it\ncaused him to suffer harm in this case.\n\nReply to appellant’s twelfth issue — Appellant has not shown the trial court\nerred in denying his motion for a new trial based upon jury misconduct, where he\nclaims the act of the jury foreman referring to his Bible during deliberations was an\noutside influence.\n\n                         \n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                    REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FIRST ISSUE\n\n      In his first point of error, appellant challenges the trial court’s denial of his\n\nmotion to suppress. Appellant filed a written motion to suppress the results of all\n\nDNA testing. (CR 454-456). At the pre-trial hearing, he focused on problems\n\nwith the HPD crime lab, and suggested the physical evidence in his case was\n\ncontaminated, and thus the DNA analysis was unreliable. (RR XVI 3-121). The\n\ntrial court disagreed and found the evidence and test results were relevant and\n\nreliable, and denied appellant’s motion to suppress. (RR XVII 3-17).\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      A trial court’s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence will not be set aside\n\nabsent a showing of abuse of discretion. Maddox v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460939\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460939/maddox-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1985). This Court does not engage in its own factual review. Instead,\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s ruling, this\n\nCourt considers only whether the trial court improperly applied the law to the\n\nfacts. Romero v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2383645\"><a href=\"/opinion/2383645/romero-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 543 (Tex.

Crim. App. 2000) (because the trial court is the exclusive\n\nfinder of fact in a motion to suppress hearing, it may choose to believe or disbelieve\n\nall or any part of a witness’s testimony). Therefore, if the record supports the trial\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcourt’s findings, this Court should not disturb those findings. Romero, 800 S.W.2d\n\nat 543.\n\nMotion to Suppress Evidence\n\n      The State presented testimony from SANE nurse Gloria Kologinczok. (RR\n\nXVI 23-25; XIX 37-50; State’s Exhibit Number 1). She was working at St. Joseph’s\n\nHospital in Houston on October 1, 1992 and performed a sexual assault\n\nexamination of Diana Garcia at 3:45 a.m. (RR XVI 25; RR XIX 43). Shortly after,\n\nat 4:24 a.m., she turned over the sexual assault evidence collection kit to HPD\n\nOfficer W.T. Bredemeyer. (RR XVI 25; RR XIX 49, 59; State’s Exhibit Number\n\n33). He maintained custody of the evidence and transported it to the HPD\n\nproperty room. (RR XIX 59-60).\n\n      Police were unsuccessful in making contact with appellant during the initial\n\ninvestigation of this case in 1992; appellant fled the country after the offense was\n\ncommitted. (RR XVI 36). The case went unsolved and was re-opened 15 years\n\nlater. (RR XVI 28-30).\n\n      In November of 2004, a cold case squad within HPD homicide was created.\n\n(RR XVI 28). In September 2007, HPD Sergeant Mehl located evidence in the\n\nHPD property room that had been collected in 1992. (RR XVI 29-30). On October\n\n2, 2007, Mehl sent some blood samples and three pieces of evidence to Orchid\n\nCellmark for analysis — a cigar, a sexual assault examination kit and a cutting\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\ffrom a pair of women’s panties. (RR XVI 30-35). At that time, HPD did not\n\npossess a DNA sample for appellant. (RR XVI 36-37).\n\n      In 2008, HPD Sergeant Stephens located appellant in a Puerto Rican prison\n\nand obtained a court order for a sample of his DNA. (RR XVI 37-38). FBI agents\n\nin Puerto Rico went to the prison where appellant was incarcerated and obtained\n\nthe DNA sample. (RR XVI 38). Mehl received the sample on May 23, 2008 and\n\nthen shipped it to Orchid for analysis with the previous items. (RR XVI 38-39).\n\n      The evidence was received by Matt Quartaro, a supervisor with Orchid\n\nCellmark. (RR XVI 48-60). Instead of relying on the DNA extractions done by\n\nHPD, Orchid performed their own DNA extractions from the evidence. (RR XVI\n\n51). When Orchid received appellant’s DNA sample, it was compared against the\n\nthree main pieces of evidence — the cigar, the sexual assault examination kit and a\n\ncutting from the panties. (RR XVI 59-60).\n\n      Orchid’s report indicated: the DNA profile on the cigar left at the crime\n\nscene was a match for appellant; the sperm fraction from the cutting of the panties\n\nwas a mixture of DNA and the major DNA profile belonged to appellant; and\n\nappellant could not be ruled out as the contributor to the DNA mixture from the\n\nvaginal swab. (RR XVI 39, 59-60). In terms of the statistical profile match,\n\nQuartaro testified the probability of that DNA profile repeating in the North\n\nAmerican population was 1 in 71.5 quadrillion of unrelated individuals. (RR XVI\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\f59-60). Once Mehl received this report, he filed capital murder charges on\n\nappellant. (RR XVI 39).\n\nAnalysis\n\n      Appellant claims the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence,\n\nthe cigar, panties and sexual assault kit that included blood samples and vaginal\n\nswabs, because the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody; this\n\nobjection was made during trial and was overruled by the trial judge. (RR XXI\n\n120-124; State’s Exhibit Numbers 33-A, 33-B, 33-C, 33-D and 95).\n\n      The State meets the authentication requirement for admissibility of\n\nevidence once it has shown the beginning and the end of the chain of custody,\n\nparticularly when the chain ends at a laboratory. McGregor v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n125 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. ref’d); see also TEX. R. EVID. 901(a).\n\nAbsent evidence of tampering or fraud, any gaps in the chain of custody do not\n\naffect the admissibility of the evidence, but rather go to the weight that the fact-\n\nfinder should give the evidence, which may be brought out and argued by the\n\nparties.   Druery v.

The kit included Diana’s panties, vaginal\n\nswabs and blood samples. (RR XVII 6). The kit was sealed and stored in the HPD\n\nproperty room at 1200 Travis. (RR XVII 6-7). In 1992, the evidence was processed\n\nand analyzed by employees of the HPD crime lab and then returned to storage,\n\nwhere it remained until 2007, when it was sent to Orchid Cellmark for analysis.\n\n(RR XVII 7).\n\n      Several blood samples were collected in 1992 and also stored at the HPD\n\nproperty room on Travis — those of Arturo Garcia, Candido Lebron, Bienviendo\n\nMelo, Leonardo German and Carmelo Martinez Santana. (RR XVII 7-8). They\n\n\n                                          20\n\fwere tested by the HPD crime lab and returned to the property room in 1992. (RR\n\nXVII 8). They were not retrieved again until December 2, 2007, when Sergeant\n\nMehl sent them to Orchid Cellmark. (RR XVII 8). The results from the HPD\n\ncrime lab were not admitted in this trial; only the results from Orchid Cellmark\n\nwere admitted. (RR XVII 8).\n\n      The cigar taken from the crime scene was stored at the HPD property room\n\non Goliad from October 1992 to October 2007. (RR XVII 6). The cigar was\n\nlocated in a larger container of evidence and there was nothing to indicate it had\n\nbeen tampered with during that time. (RR XVII 6). Although it may have been\n\nsent to the HPD crime lab with other evidence, there is nothing to indicate it was\n\never tested by the lab. (RR XVI 112-113). The package appeared unopened when it\n\nwas sent to Orchid Cellmark for DNA testing on October 2, 2007. (RR XVII 6, 8).\n\n      In 2008, a sample of appellant’s DNA sample was obtained and shipped\n\ndirectly to Orchid for analysis. (RR XVI 37-39; RR XVII 10). It was never stored\n\nor tested by the HPD crime lab. This known sample was compared against the\n\nprofiles found in the sexual assault kit evidence and cigar. (RR XVII 10).\n\n      In support of his contention that the evidence was tainted, appellant\n\nprovided the trial court with the Bromwich Report, which detailed issues in the\n\nHPD crime lab.

He challenges his identification as the culprit, the credibility of\n\nfour witnesses, as well as the strength of the evidence regarding Diana’s sexual\n\nassault and Adam’s death. Appellant also claims there was no evidence of his\n\nmotive to commit this crime. (Appellant’s brief 76-85).\n\n      Appellant challenges the evidence identifying him, focusing on the incorrect\n\ndescriptions of the suspects as black men by police early in the investigation.\n\nDiana and Arturo had described the men as having dark complexions, speaking\n\nwith Spanish accents.      Nothing about the police’s initial report renders the\n\nevidence of appellant’s identity insufficient, especially in the light of the DNA\n\nevidence revealing he was the man who sexually assaulted Diana.

Diana Garcia\n\nand Arturo Rodriguez testified regarding what happened to them at the apartment\n\non September 30, 1992, establishing the sexual assault of Diana, the beating of\n\nArturo and kidnapping of Adam. Appellant complains their testimony was not\n\ncredible because the couple initially lied to police about their involvement in\n\nselling drugs. Diana admitted they lied to police the first night, because they were\n\nafraid, but told the truth the following day. (RR XVIII 166-167).\n\n      Carmelo Santana provided evidence about the kidnapping and murder of\n\nAdam, as he had been with appellant on that night. He established that appellant\n\ntook Adam from the apartment and ordered Aviles-Barrosso to kill him. Appellant\n\ncomplains Santana’s testimony is not credible because he was serving a federal\n\nsentence at the time of trial, he had a motive to distance himself from the crime\n\nand some of his testimony contradicted his earlier statements.\n\n      Angelita Rodriguez was appellant’s wife at the time of this offense. She\n\nprovided evidence about appellant’s drug dealing, his immediate flight from the\n\ncountry and testified appellant admitted to her that he killed Adam. Appellant\n\ncomplains she was not a credible witness because she had a motive to see\n\nappellant punished, because he had been unfaithful and left her in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\f      The concerns appellant has articulated with regard to these witnesses were\n\nall presented and argued to the jury during trial.

He claims the lack of physical evidence, coupled with the DNA\n\nevidence, merely shows sexual contact with Diana, not sexual assault. During\n\nclosing argument, defense counsel suggested Diana and appellant had a consensual\n\nsexual relationship. (RR XXIII 44-45).\n\n      But this is contrary to Diana’s testimony. She gave very specific details\n\nabout being blindfolded and sexually assaulted that night. Diana recalled that the\n\nperpetrator ejaculated, which was consistent with her physical exam, where DNA\n\nevidence was left behind. SANE nurse Kologinczok testified she did not observe\n\nany signs of physical injury during Diana’s sexual assault exam, but noted that in\n\nmost exams, she did not find physical injuries. (RR XIX 48-49). Appellant\n\nadmitted to Santana that he sexually assaulted Diana.

Although the sexual assault evidence was important to show\n\nappellant’s presence and participation in the kidnapping and murder of Adam, the\n\njury did not have to find the elements of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nAppellant was not charged with the sexual assault of Diana; the underlying felony\n\nin the capital murder indictment was kidnapping. (CR 2-3).\n\n      Appellant complains the evidence is insufficient to prove he killed Adam as\n\nalleged in the indictment because the State, through Dr. Wolf, was unable to\n\nprovide conclusive evidence regarding Adam’s cause of death.

(RR XX 8-9, 12). Adam’s body was found over a month after his\n\nkidnapping and had been submerged in water, so Dr. Wolf was unable to assess\n\nhis skin surfaces and organs. (RR XX 8). He also stated that any blood from\n\nAdam’s pajamas would have washed away during the time he was in the water.\n\n(RR XX 14-15).\n\n      Both DNA evidence and the testimony of Santana placed appellant at the\n\napartment when Adam was kidnapped.

Agent Johnson learned that\n\nappellant missed a court appearance on October 8, 1992 for a criminal case in\n\nHarris County and his bond was forfeited. (RR XIX 140-142; RR XX 103-104;\n\nState’s Exhibit Number 36). This was one week after Adam’s kidnapping. (RR\n\nXIX 142). After speaking with appellant’s wife, Agent Johnson began looking for\n\nappellant in Puerto Rico. (RR XIX 144-145).\n\n       Prior to the presentment of this bond forfeiture evidence, the parties had a\n\nlengthy discussion about the admissibility of this evidence. (RR XIX 105-130).\n\nThe trial court limited its ruling to the fact that appellant had failed to appear for a\n\ncourt appearance and his bond was forfeited. (RR XIX 113-115). The trial judge\n\ndid not allow Agent Johnson to reveal that the offense was for drug possession or\n\nthat it was a pending felony offense, finding this information would be too\n\nprejudicial. (RR XIX 121). The judge also ordered that the bond forfeiture\n\npaperwork be redacted, to delete any references to the offense being a felony or for\n\ndrug possession.2 (RR XIX 123-124, 127; State’s Exhibit Number 36).\n\n\n\n2\n  FBI Special Agent Johnson explained to the trial judge that he had filed an unlawful flight to\navoid prosecution case against appellant after he bond forfeited; he explained he obtained the\nwarrant so he could legally search for appellant throughout the United States. (RR XIX 111-112).\nBut the trial court did not allow evidence of this federal charge to be heard by the jury. (RR XIX\n113-115).\n\n\n                                               34\n\f      Evidence of bond forfeiture may be admissible to show flight under Rule\n\n404(b). Bigby v.

(RR XIX 125-126). Appellant argues because he bond forfeited on a criminal\n\ncharge that was not the one he was on trial for, i.e. the drug possession case, it was\n\nerror for the trial court to admit the evidence.\n\n      But the timing of appellant’s flight from the United States demonstrates it\n\nwas related to the capital murder. The day after Adam’s kidnapping and murder,\n\nappellant told his wife and Santana that he was leaving the country and traveling\n\nto Puerto Rico. (RR XX 99, 158-159). It was not a planned trip.

Appellant attempted to offer Defense Exhibit Numbers\n\n48-55, which are bible study certificates appellant claimed he earned while in\n\nprison in Puerto Rico, through his brother, punishment witness Joel Cruz-Garcia.\n\n(RR XXVI 56-58). The defense claimed the basis for offering them was that\n\nappellant had talked to the witness about these things, “Not that the witness took\n\nthe courses with him, but he’s talked to him about it.” Joel Cruz-Garcia testified\n\nhe went to church with appellant on one occasion, but he did not indicate he\n\npossessed any personal knowledge about appellant’s participation in bible study.\n\n(RR XXVI 41-42, 54).\n\n      The State objected on the basis of hearsay and defense counsel admitted the\n\ncertificates were hearsay. (RR XXVI 57-58). He did not argue that any exception\n\nto the hearsay rule applied. (RR XXVI 57-58). The trial court inquired whether\n\nappellant had gotten a business record affidavit for the certificates.

(RR XXVI 58). The trial judge ruled that\n\nwhile the certificates may be relevant, they were hearsay if admitted through that\n\nparticular witness. (RR XXVI 58).\n\n      In his seventh issue, appellant claims the trial court prevented him from\n\nintroducing evidence that he was an informant for the FBI, DEA or INS. Agent\n\nJuan DeJesus Rodriguez, who works with the police in Puerto Rico, testified he\n\ninvestigated the kidnappings of Andres Buten and William Martinez. (RR XXIV\n\n43-61). During cross-examination, defense counsel wanted to inquire whether\n\nRodriguez had learned during his investigation that appellant was a corroborating\n\nwitness for the FBI, DEA or INS. (RR XXIV69-70).\n\n      The jury was taken out and defense counsel asked the witness on voir dire\n\nwhether he could verify this information. (RR XXIV 70-73). Rodriguez stated he\n\nwas told orally that appellant had cooperated with law enforcement in the past,\n\nbut he never got confirmation in writing. (RR XXIV 72-73). There was no\n\nevidence appellant was cooperating with law enforcement in regard to the\n\nkidnapping cases in Puerto Rico. (RR XXIV 73). And Rodriguez did not provide\n\nthe source of this information; thus the State objected on hearsay grounds. (RR\n\nXXIV 72-74). Defense counsel again did not argue that any hearsay exceptions\n\napplied.   The judge ruled it was inadmissible hearsay at this juncture, but\n\ninstructed defense counsel if he could present a witness who had personal\n\n\n\n                                       39\n\fknowledge that appellant had previously cooperated with law enforcement, she\n\nwould admit the evidence, as being relevant to mitigation.

The SANE nurse. She came here and she said: Well,\n\n                                         43\n\f      there were no injuries. Wow, that must mean Obel Cruz-Garcia is\n      guilty — is not guilty of capital murder according to the defense\n      attorneys. No. Let’s talk about what else the SANE nurse said. And I\n      want to say she said 95 percent — it was a very high percentage — of\n      rape cases that she does SANE nurse examinations on —\n\n      DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection. Outside the record.\n\n      PROSECUTOR: — do not have any injuries.\n\n      THE COURT: Overruled. But I will remind the jury that you recall\n      the testimony from the witness stand and that is — that will be your\n      guide in your deliberations. Arguments of counsel is not evidence.\n      (sic) (RR XXIII 80).\n\n      SANE nurse Gloria Kologinczok testified she performed several hundred\n\nsexual assault exams during her tenure at St. Joseph’s Hospital. (RR XIX 40). She\n\nperformed the sexual assault exam of Diana on October 1, 1992. (RR XIX 48). She\n\ndid not see any signs of physical injury or trauma during this exam. (RR XIX 48).\n\nKologinczok testified that in most of the sexual assault exams she has performed,\n\nshe did not find physical injuries. (RR XIX 48-49).\n\n      Appellant is correct that the prosecutor mischaracterized the testimony\n\nprovided by the SANE nurse.        There is nothing in the record to indicate\n\nKologinczok quantified her testimony with a statistic regarding the lack of\n\nphysical injuries in her examinations. Although the prosecutor’s use of the high\n\npercentage could be inferable from Kologinczok’s testimony that “in most cases,”\n\nshe sees no physical injury.

She did not emphasize the\n\ncomment and immediately moved on after the objection. (RR XXIII 81). Further,\n\nviewing the record as a whole, appellant does not appear to have been prejudiced\n\nby the comment, as the SANE nurse did testify she rarely sees physical injuries.\n\n      While the trial court did sua sponte remind the jury that closing arguments\n\nwere not evidence, there was no curative instruction.

The evidence\n\npresented during the guilt phase demonstrated appellant was man who raped\n\nDiana, kidnapped Adam and ordered his death.            Given the brevity of the\n\n\n                                        45\n\fprosecutor’s comment, the lack of prejudice, and the strength of the evidence\n\nsupporting appellant’s conviction, any error associated with this comment was\n\nharmless. Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at 728-729. Appellant’s eighth issue should be\n\noverruled.\n\n      In his ninth issue, appellant complains the prosecutor improperly injected\n\nher personal beliefs regarding appellant’s guilt as a party during closing argument\n\nin the guilt phase of trial. Appellant specifically complains about a comment the\n\nprosecutor made after going through the party language in the charge:\n\n      PROSECUTOR: We ask you to find him guilty as a party because\n      what we believed happened is the defendant directed and\n      encouraged—\n\n      DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection to putting beliefs into the\n      argument, Your Honor. It’s improper.\n\n      THE COURT: That will be overruled.\n\n      PROSECUTOR: What the evidence supports is that the defendant\n      directed and encouraged Roger to kill the little boy. (RR XXIII 92).\n\n      Appellant complains the State’s argument went outside the record and\n\ninvited the jury to consider the prosecutor’s opinion. A prosecutor may not inject\n\nher personal opinion in statements to the jury or imply a special expertise about a\n\ncontested factual matter. Johnson v.

You weren’t there. It’s a tough decision to try to reconstruct beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt what happened.” (RR XXIII 63). The prosecutor’s comment\n\nwas clearly a response to this argument and was the prosecutor’s opinion of the\n\nevidence presented in the trial. The prosecutor did not claim to possess any\n\nspecial expertise of knowledge outside of the record. Therefore, the trial court did\n\nnot err in overruling appellant’s objection.

(RR XXVI\n      163-164) (emphasis added).\n\n      Defense counsel objected the last line of that passage was outside of\n\nthe record. (RR XXVI 164-165). The trial court overruled his objection but\n\ninstructed the prosecutor to clear up her argument. (RR XXVI 165). The\n\nprosecutor complied:\n\n      PROSECUTOR: What I’m saying to you is, is that the defendant was\n      the boss. The defendant told Roger to kill the little boy… And without\n      hesitation, he got out of the car and opened the door and he told\n      Roger in Spanish: You know what you have to do.

App. 2012).\n\nMotion For New Trial Evidence\n\n      On July 19, 2013, the jury was in the second day of punishment deliberations.\n\n(RR XXVI 176-178; RR XXVII 3-14). At approximately 3:20 p.m., jury member\n\nAngela Bowman sent a note asking to speak to the trial judge. (CR 512). The trial\n\njudge allowed this jury member to speak to her in the privacy of her chambers,\n\nwithin the presence of the court reporter. (RR XXVII 3-4).\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f      When the trial judge asked Bowman what she needed to relay to the court,\n\nBowman replied that she could not agree with other jurors on the special issues\n\nand felt pressured. (RR XXVII 4-5). Bowman urged the judge to allow an\n\nalternate to take her place. (RR XXVII 5). The judge educated Bowman on the\n\nlaw in this regard, and Bowman replied that the jury was never going to come to\n\nan agreement. (RR XXVII 6). Bowman also stated that she did not want to have\n\nto stay another night. (RR XXVII 8). The judge instructed her to resume her\n\ndeliberations with the jury until otherwise directed by the court. (RR XXVII 6-8).\n\nBowman returned to the jury room and the jury returned its punishment verdict\n\non all three special issues at approximately 4:30 p.m. (CR 523-527).\n\n      One of appellant’s trial attorneys, Mario Madrid, provided an affidavit\n\nwhere he summarized a conversation he had with Bowman later that night.\n\n(Defense Exhibit Number 1).         He stated Bowman was distraught over the\n\npunishment deliberations and claimed she was pressured into changing her\n\ndecision. Id. She explained her decision was complicated by the fact that her\n\ndaughter was ill and she was unable to attend to her due to sequestration. Id.\n\nBowman also stated the jury foreman quoted from his Bible during the\n\ndeliberations, and she felt it influenced other jurors. Id.\n\n      Angela Bowman provided an affidavit as well and expanded on what she\n\ninitially told the trial judge and Mario Madrid. (Defense Exhibit Number 3).\n\n\n                                           58\n\fBowman claimed she received a phone call from her daughter’s camp counselor on\n\nthe first day of deliberations, July 18, 2013. Id. In her affidavit, she claims her\n\ndaughter had a fever and stated, “If it had not been for my concern over my\n\ndaughter’s health condition, I would have remained committed to voting for life in\n\nprison.” Id. She also noted that the jury foreman took out his Bible when another\n\njuror, Casey Guillotte, sought spiritual guidance to make her decision.            Id.\n\nBowman did not claim the act of referencing the Bible caused her to change her\n\ndecision, she was clear, “I changed my verdict so I could go home and take care of\n\nmy child.” Id.\n\n      The defense also submitted an affidavit from their investigator, J.J. Gradoni.\n\n(Defense Exhibit Number 2). His statement substantiates much of what was\n\nincluded in the affidavits provided by Mario Madrid and Angela Bowman. Id. He\n\nalso added that he interviewed the jury foreman, Matthew Clinger, who admitted\n\nhe pulled out his personal Bible during deliberations and read from it. Id. Clinger\n\nshared the fact that he looked to his Bible for spiritual guidance with Casey\n\nGuillotte. Id.\n\n      The State presented two affidavits in its response to appellant’s motion for\n\nnew trial, in the alternative, if the trial court ruled the affidavits were admissible\n\nunder Rule 609(b). (RR XXIX 11).\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f      The first was from Casey Guillotte. (States’ Exhibit Number 1). She stated\n\nthe jury came back on the first two special issues unanimously, then turned to the\n\nthird special issue—whether there was sufficient mitigation evidence to warrant\n\nlife in prison rather than the death penalty. Id. She said at this point, she asked the\n\nentire jury about how each of them would come to terms with the verdict, from an\n\nemotional standpoint. Id. Guillotte stated in response to her question, Clinger\n\nretrieved his personal Bible from his belongings and read a passage to himself. Id.\n\nHe told her he found comfort with his decision because of a verse in the book of\n\nRomans. Id. She stated Clinger did not read the Bible to the jury or direct any of\n\nthem to a particular passage, and it not influence her decision. Id.\n\n      The State also presented an affidavit from Matthew Clinger, the jury\n\nforeman. (State’s Exhibit Number 2). He recalled when deciding the three special\n\nissues, the jury agreed to focus their discussions on the facts and not emotions. Id.\n\nClinger remembered that Casey Guillotte, while staying true to this intention,\n\nwondered aloud how they would all deal with the aftermath of their verdict. Id.\n\nSeveral of the jurors shared how they dealt with their emotions and he told\n\nGuillotte he found comfort in the Bible. Id. Although he pulled out his Bible for\n\nhimself, he did not read from it aloud, nor did Guillotte read it.            Id. He\n\ncharacterized the conversation as sharing advice for coping with the emotional\n\nramifications of their decision. Id.\n\n                                          60\n\fAnalysis\n\n      The record reveals the trial court admitted the affidavits in an abundance of\n\ncaution, but held the belief the affidavits were not admissible under Rule 606(b).\n\nThe judge specifically stated that she did not think a Bible production or Bible\n\nreading (which ever occurred) constituted an “outside influence.” (RR XXIX 28).\n\nThis is legally correct based on the facts of this case.\n\n      This Court has considered the term “outside influence” when evaluating\n\nwhether evidence from jurors is admissible in a motion for new trial under Rule\n\n606(b). In 2012, this Court decided McQuarrie v. State; the defendant in that case\n\nwas charged with sexual assault and he maintained it was consensual sex,\n\nalthough the victim claimed she was drugged. McQuarrie, 380 S.W.3d at 147-148,\n\n150-155. After one day of deliberating, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous\n\nverdict, so they resumed deliberations the following day. Id. at 148. The next day,\n\none of the jurors shared information with the rest of the jury concerning internet\n\nresearch he performed the night before, on the effects of date rape drugs, pertinent\n\nto the case. Id. In holding the internet research qualified as an outside influence\n\nfor which the defendant should have been permitted to conduct a post-trial\n\ninquiry, this Court stated, “A Rule 606(b) inquiry is limited to that which occurs\n\noutside the jury room and outside of the juror’s personal knowledge and\n\nexperience.” Id. at 153.\n\n\n                                           61\n\f      In 2014, this Court clarified that personal pressures—such as fear of\n\ninclement weather or concern about a child’s illness—are not “outside influences\n\nunder Rule 606(b). See Colyer, 428 S.W.3d at 119. Juror testimony on these subjects\n\nis not admissible to show jury misconduct. Id. at 127-128 (rejecting defense\n\ncontention that weather and a call from child’s doctor constitute information\n\noutside the jury room, since these are influences unrelated to the trial issues);\n\ncompare McQuarrie, 380 S.W.3d at 154-155.\n\n      A collective reading of this authority demonstrates why the affidavits in this\n\ncase are not admissible to show an “outside influence” under Rule 606(b). (CR\n\n12). First, Bowman never asserted the bible reading affected her decision. She\n\nclaimed the stress over her daughter’s illness caused her to change her vote. This\n\nfalls squarely within the holding of Colyer and her affidavit should not be\n\nadmissible in support of appellant’s new trial. See Colyer, 428 S.W.3d at 127-128\n\n(rejecting defendant’s interpretation of “outside influence,” which could include a\n\njuror that has second thoughts about his vote and then retroactively claim that a\n\npersonal pressure, such as his job, marriage, or children, made him apprehensive\n\nand eager to conclude the deliberations).\n\n      And the religious conversation in the jury room was characterized as one of\n\ncomfort, from one jury member to another, on dealing with the emotions of\n\nparticipating in this trial and assessing a difficult punishment. The foreman did\n\n\n                                        62\n\fnot read the Bible out loud to the jury, but to himself. It was not a source of new\n\nevidence pertaining to the issues in this case, as in McQuarrie. It was the foreman’s\n\npersonal belief that he shared during deliberations, which is not a permissible\n\nchallenge to the verdict. See Hines v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1773469\"><a href=\"/opinion/1773469/hines-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n\n1999, pet. ref’d) (a juror’s injection of his own personal experiences, knowledge, or\n\nexpertise is not considered an “outside influence,” because those representations\n\nemanate from inside the jury). And even assuming the record demonstrated the\n\nforeman was using his religious beliefs to coerce other jurors, it does not\n\nconstitute an “outside influence.” Id. (coercive influence of one juror on the rest of\n\nthe panel does not constitute an “outside influence”).\n\n      Therefore, the defense affidavits relating to this incident are not admissible\n\nunder Rule 606(b) to support his motion for new trial. Compare Oliver v. Quaterman,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"63254\"><a href=\"/opinion/63254/oliver-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (5th 2008) (jury’s Bible consultation as a group constituted an\n\nexternal influence on deliberations where the jury did not simply discuss their\n\nown understanding of religious law and morality or merely quote the Bible, but\n\ninstead compared the facts of their case to a specific passage in the Bible that\n\ntaught capital punishment was appropriate for murder).\n\n      Even assuming the affidavits are admissible in this case, appellant has not\n\nshown the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new trial. In\n\n2008, this Court decided Lucero v. State; the defendant in that case was charged\n\n\n                                         63\n\fwith capital murder and claimed on appeal he was entitled to a new trial because\n\nthe jury foreman read scripture from the Bible during punishment deliberations.\n\nLucero v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1402471\"><a href=\"/opinion/1402471/lucero-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Evidence in that case\n\nrevealed that the jury foreman read a passage from the Bible that lasted\n\napproximately 2-3 minutes during the hours-long deliberations. Id. at 92. This\n\nCourt declined to decide whether the jury foreman’s reading of the Bible was an\n\n“outside influence,” and denied the defendant’s motion for new trial because the\n\naffidavits were devoid of any evidence that the scripture reading affected the jury’s\n\npunishment verdict of death. Id. at 95.\n\n       The affidavits in this case similarly contain no evidence that references to\n\nthe Bible affected any juror’s punishment decision.4 (State’s Exhibit Number 1;\n\nDefense Exhibit Number 3). Thus, appellant has not shown he should have been\n\ngranted a new trial, even when considering this evidence. See Oliver, 541 F.3d at\n\n341-344 (jury’s decision to impose the death penalty, despite the fact they\n\nconsulted an external influence, was harmless due to evidence from the jurors that\n\nit did not prejudice their decision).\n4\n  Appellant also claims the trial court erred by not having a hearing on his motion. (Appellant’s\nbrief 114-115). The defense was asked specifically about any other evidence that would show a\njuror was influenced by the bible reference, and he acknowledged there was nothing more than\nthe affidavits presented. (RR XXIX 24). Lucero is instructive on this issue, finding the lack of\nevidence from any juror showing the bible reading affected their verdict supported the trial\ncourt’s decision not to hold a hearing.
