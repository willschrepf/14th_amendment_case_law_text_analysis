Goldberg, Judge, United States Court of International Trade,\nsitting by designation.\n\f       Maurice Dorvilus appeals his conviction and 204-month sentence for\n\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(e).\n\nAfter review, we affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       On the morning of April 22, 2008, Dorvilus’ 13-year-old son was struck by\n\na Miami-Dade police car while waiting at his school bus stop. Dorvilus spent the\n\nday at the hospital, where he was joined by other family members, and he left in\n\nthe evening. While he was driving to the store, Dorvilus failed to make a complete\n\nstop at a stop sign. Paul Villaverde, a detective for the Miami-Dade Police\n\nRobbery Investigation Unit, saw that traffic violation, discovered an outstanding\n\nwarrant for Dorvilus’ arrest, and called for backup. Detective Willy Diaz\n\nresponded, pulling up beside Dorvilus’ white Cadillac Escalade, which was parked\n\nat the store.\n\n       The officers arrested Dorvilus after he exited the store. While patting him\n\ndown, Diaz found a loaded .40 caliber Glock 27 handgun in Dorvilus’ waistband.\n\nAfter securing the gun and continuing the pat down, Diaz removed an Apple\n\niPhone from the right front pocket of Dorvilus’ pants. The cellular phone\n\ncontained roughly 600 photos, about 20 of which showed Dorvilus posing with\n\nmoney or what appeared to be firearms. One such photo was displayed on the\n\n                                         2\n\fiPhone’s “face page,” which is visible when the iPhone is turned on and one of its\n\nbuttons has been pressed. It showed Dorvilus holding what appear to be two\n\nhandguns while standing next to a white Cadillac Escalade.\n\n      Dorvilus filed a motion to suppress the photos. At the suppression hearing,\n\nDiaz testified that the face page photo was immediately visible as he took the\n\niPhone from Dorvilus’ pocket. As for the other photos, Diaz testified that he\n\nfound them by “unlocking” the iPhone and then scrolling through its photo\n\ndirectory. In his Report and Recommendation the magistrate judge found Diaz’s\n\naccount of the arrest to be credible and concluded that the motion to suppress\n\nshould be denied. The judge reasoned that there had been no “search” of the face\n\npage photo because it was in plain view, and the other photos were found by a\n\nsearch incident to a lawful arrest. Continuing to press his contention that the\n\nFourth Amendment required suppression of the photos, Dorvilus objected to the\n\nR&R. He also sought to achieve the same end by filing a motion in limine to\n\npreclude admission of the photos on Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 702\n\ngrounds. His position was that the photos were unfairly prejudicial, and that the\n\nexpert the government planned to use would not be able to positively identify any\n\ngun in the photos as the one seized from him at the time of his arrest.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      The district court did not rule on Dorvilus’ objections to the R&R or on his\n\nmotion in limine before trial. The court did hear arguments on the motion in\n\nlimine at the beginning of the trial but, viewing the photos as Rule 404(b)\n\nevidence, decided to wait until the court heard the government’s evidence. The\n\ncourt’s thinking apparently was that if the photos were not properly admissible\n\nunder Rule 404(b), the other issues about their admissibility would be moot. The\n\ncourt did say that it would issue an order on the motion to suppress, but it did not\n\ndo so during the trial. After hearing the other evidence, the court ruled from the\n\nbench that the photos could not be admitted under Rule 404(b). The jury found\n\nDorvilus guilty. Three months later, the court entered a written order, purporting\n\nto make it nunc pro tunc to the date the trial began, which denied the motion to\n\nsuppress, adopted the R&R over Dorvilus’ objections, and ruled that his\n\nobjections were moot because none of the photos had been admitted into evidence.\n\n      Because Dorvilus was classified as an armed career criminal under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e), he faced a 15-year minimum sentence. The court sentenced him\n\nto 204 months imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, and a\n\n$100 special assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                                               II.\n\n       Dorvilus first contends that the district court erred by failing to rule on\n\nwhether he had made a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination\n\nduring jury selection. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712\n\n(1986).\n\n       The government used four peremptory strikes during the selection of the\n\ntwelve regular jurors. Three of those strikes were used to remove African\n\nAmericans from the jury and the fourth was against a non-African American.\n\nThere were at least two African Americans left on the jury; maybe more.1 And the\n\ngovernment had two strikes that it did not use. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(b)(2)\n\n(entitling the government to six peremptory challenges against regular jurors in a\n\nnon-capital felony case).\n\n       After the government used its first strike against an African American, the\n\ndefense began to object: “Defense would note for the record that Juror No. 13 is a\n\n\n       1\n          The government claims the jury included three African Americans, but the record is\nunclear. The government told the district court that “Jurors No. 14, 15, [whom] we didn’t\nstrike[,] are African-American women” and that “Juror No. 8 is an African-American man.”\nHowever, prospective Juror 15 was not on the list that the courtroom deputy called out of those\nwho had been selected to serve. At trial, the government did say, “Almost every juror in the back\nrow we didn’t strike is African-American,” but the record does not disclose how many jurors\nwere selected from those venire members on the back row. Thus, we know that the jury did\ninclude two African Americans (8 and 14) and there may have been others.\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fblack female and we’d ask the government—.” The court overruled the objection:\n\n“This is the first challenge, so there’s no pattern, so if you’re trying to raise a\n\nBatson issue at this early stage, overruled.” The defense did not object after any\n\nof the government’s next three strikes, two of which were also against African\n\nAmericans.\n\n      At that point, twelve jurors had been selected to serve, but the court\n\ncontinued the selection process in order to seat alternates. The court gave each\n\nparty two strikes and said that the alternate jurors would be the first two who were\n\nnot struck. The defense struck Juror 31. The government then expressed its\n\nintention to strike Juror 36, an African American. The following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Your Honor, just for the record, this is now—I believe Juror\n      No. 36 is a black female, so was Juror No. 17 and Juror 27.\n\n      MR. RASHBAUM: Your Honor, with all due respect, Jurors No. 14, 15, we\n      didn’t strike are African-American women. Almost every juror in the back row we\n      didn’t strike is African-American. Juror No. 8 is an African-American man.\n\n      THE COURT: I don’t even think we’re going to get to No. 36. Let me see.\n      Irregardless of your challenge, what is your next peremptory challenge?\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Juror 32, Ms. Delgado.\n\n      THE COURT: So the alternates are Gutierrez and Pintado and we don’t even reach\n      36, so it’s not necessary for me to even rule on the Batson challenge.\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Yes, sir.\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      THE COURT: All right. Thank you very much.\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Thank you, Judge.\n\n      We review de novo the constitutional issues presented by a Batson\n\nchallenge, though we accord “great deference” to a district court’s ruling on\n\nwhether the objecting party established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 299 F.3d 1252, 1255 (11th Cir. 2002). We review\n\nBatson-related factual findings for clear error. United States v. Novaton, 271 F.3d\n\n968, 1001 (11th Cir. 2001). “The Batson three-step procedure for evaluating an\n\nobjection to a peremptory challenge is as follows: (1) the objector must make a\n\nprima facie showing that the peremptory challenge is exercised on the basis of\n\nrace; (2) the burden then shifts to the challenger to articulate a race-neutral\n\nexplanation for striking the jurors in question; and (3) the trial court must\n\ndetermine whether the objector has carried its burden of proving purposeful\n\ndiscrimination.” United States v. Allen-Brown, 243 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.\n\n2001). All of that, however, assumes that Batson issues were preserved for\n\nappellate review by a proper objection.\n\n      We first address whether Dorvilus preserved by objection in the district\n\ncourt the Batson issues he is attempting to pursue before us. If he did not, our\n\nreview is only for plain error. See United States v. Dudley, 463 F.3d 1221, 1227\n\n\n                                           7\n\f(11th Cir. 2006). Dorvilus did object after the government’s first strike, so any\n\nerror the court committed at that point is preserved. But the court correctly\n\noverruled that objection as premature because no prima facie case had been shown\n\nat that early stage. One strike does not a pattern make, and at that point there was\n\nno other indication that the government was discriminating against African\n\nAmericans.\n\n      Later, during the selection of alternates, when the government expressed its\n\nintention to strike Juror 36, defense counsel noted for the record that three of the\n\njurors the government had already struck were African Americans. Although the\n\ncourt interpreted that as a Batson objection, it viewed the objection as going only\n\nto Juror 36. That is apparent from the judge’s explanation a few minutes later that,\n\nbecause they had not reached Juror 36, it was unnecessary to rule on the objection.\n\nDorvilus’ counsel could have objected to the court’s failure to rule on her\n\nobjection if she had intended that the objection cover any of the earlier jurors who\n\nactually were struck, but she did not do that. Instead, she affirmatively agreed\n\nwith the court’s suggestion that the failure to reach Juror 36 made it unnecessary\n\nto rule on the Batson challenge. As a result, any error in the court’s failure to rule\n\nwas not properly preserved. Cf. Hopson v. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1377–78\n\n(8th Cir. 1992) (“His failure to follow up on his Batson objection [after the\n\n                                           8\n\fgovernment offered race-neutral reasons for its strikes] could have been\n\nreasonably construed by the trial judge as an agreement that the expressed reasons\n\nwere racially neutral. Because Hopson failed to properly preserve this issue for\n\nappeal by failing to object at trial, we must review his claim under the plain error\n\nstandard.”).\n\n      Because Dorvilus did not properly preserve any error in the court’s failure\n\nto rule on whether he had established a prima face case of purposeful racial\n\ndiscrimination once the government made clear that it intended to strike Juror 36,\n\nif necessary, our review is only for plain error. “Before an error is subject to\n\ncorrection under the plain error rule, it must be plain under controlling precedent\n\nor in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule; it must have\n\nadversely affected the outcome of the proceedings; and it must be such that the\n\nfailure to correct it would seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.” United States v. Lett, 483 F.3d 782, 790 (11th\n\nCir. 2007) (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732–37, 113 S. Ct. 1770,\n\n1776–79 (1993)). We find no plain error. Even if it was error not to rule on\n\nwhether there was a prima facie case, and even if the error was plain, Dorvilus has\n\nnot established that there is a reasonable probability of a different result at his trial\n\nif the court had ruled. See United States v. Rodriguez, 398 F.3d 1291, 1299–1306\n\n                                            9\n\f(11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that the third component of the plain error test\n\nrequires a defendant to show that but for the claimed error there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the result of the proceeding would have been different). Dorvilus\n\nhas not established that if the court had ruled on whether he had established a\n\nprima facie case, the ruling would have been in his favor; nor has he established\n\nthat the government would not have been able to articulate a race-neutral\n\nexplanation for its strikes; nor has he established that he would have been able to\n\nconvince the court that the government’s reasons were pretextual.\n\n      We have held that “the unchallenged presence of two blacks on the jury\n\nundercuts any inference of impermissible discrimination that might be argued to\n\narise from the fact that the prosecutor used three of the four peremptory challenges\n\nhe exercised to strike blacks.” United States v. Dennis, 804 F.2d 1208, 1211 (11th\n\nCir. 1986). We reaffirmed that holding recently in United States v. Campa, 529\n\nF.3d 980, 998 (11th Cir. 2008), which referred to Dennis as a “well-established\n\nprecedent.” Here, as in Dennis, the government used three of the four peremptory\n\nchallenges it exercised to strike African Americans, allowed at least two African\n\nAmericans to be seated on the jury, and did not use all of its peremptory\n\nchallenges. We held in Dennis that the district court would have erred as a matter\n\nof law if it had found an inference of impermissible discrimination in these\n\n                                         10\n\fcircumstances. Dennis, 804 F.2d at 1211; see also Campa, 529 F.3d at 998.\n\nDorvilus invites us to reconsider Dennis and Campa, asserting that they are in\n\ntension with Supreme Court precedent. We cannot do that, because we are bound\n\nby our prior panel precedent. See, e.g., United States v. Emmanuel, 565 F.3d\n\n1324, 1332 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n      Dorvilus cites McGahee v. Alabama Department of Corrections, 560 F.3d\n\n1252 (11th Cir. 2009), for the proposition that the district court’s failure to rule on\n\nwhether he made a prima facie showing under Batson was itself reversible error.\n\nIn McGahee we concluded that a state court unreasonably applied clearly\n\nestablished federal law by denying the defendant’s Batson challenge “based only\n\nupon the State’s proffer of generalized reasons for its peremptory challenges, and\n\nbecause the trial court failed to make any ruling following the State’s proffer of\n\nindividualized reasons for its peremptory challenges.” Id. at 1257. McGahee is\n\ndifferent from this case because it involved the failure of the district court to rule\n\nunder step three of the Batson framework—after the defendant had established a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination (step one) and the state had articulated a race-\n\nneutral explanation (step two). See id. at 1259 n.7 & 1260. At step three, “after a\n\nprosecutor has made his proffer of specific explanations, the trial court must make\n\na determination of whether the defendant has established purposeful\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscrimination.” Id. at 1260 (emphasis added); see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 98,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 1724; Allen-Brown, 243 F.3d at 1297. But in this case the district\n\ncourt never determined that there was a prima facie case, so McGahee’s discussion\n\nof what courts should do after they decide that a prima facie case has been\n\nestablished does not apply. See, e.g., United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez, 428 F.3d\n\n1015, 1044 n.38 (11th Cir. 2005) (“[D]istrict courts usually make the\n\nprima-facie-case determination under Batson’s first prong. Yet, that is not\n\nnecessary if, as a matter of law, the defendant's evidence on the Batson issue is\n\ninsufficient to show a prima facie case.” (citations omitted)).\n\n          Moreover, it appears from the record that if the court had found a prima\n\nfacie case, the government would have been able to articulate race-neutral reasons\n\nfor striking the three African Americans it did. The father of Juror 13’s children\n\nwas incarcerated. Juror 17 had a family member involved in a criminal case a few\n\nyears ago, and she admitted that she has “some issues like about judging things\n\nthat I don’t know about and . . . a strong thing about going off my opinion about\n\nsituations.” Juror 27 was an investigator for the state public defender. (The\n\ngovernment did not actually strike Juror 36, but it would have had an obvious\n\nrace-neutral reason for doing so: her child was incarcerated at the time of the\n\ntrial.)\n\n                                            12\n\f      Not only that, but Dorvilus certainly has not established that if he had\n\ninsisted on his suggestion that there might be a Batson problem and if one or more\n\nof the government’s strikes had been disallowed, the result of the trial would have\n\nbeen different. As we explained in Rodriguez, “where we would have to\n\nspeculate—the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable\n\nprobability that the result would have been different but for the error; he has not\n\nmet his burden of showing prejudice; he has not met his burden of showing that\n\nhis substantial rights have been affected.” 398 F.3d at 1301. Dorvilus has not\n\nshown plain error.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      Dorvilus contends he was denied due process and his ability to present a\n\ndefense was hampered because the district court did not make “a de novo\n\ndetermination” of the disputed portions of the magistrate judge’s R&R on the\n\nmotion to suppress the photos on his iPhone. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) (“A judge\n\nof the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or\n\nspecified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.”).\n\n      Dorvilus argues that the district court judge could not accept the magistrate\n\njudge’s credibility findings without conducting a new evidentiary hearing. The\n\nSupreme Court has rejected that interpretation of § 636(b)(1). See United States v.\n\n                                         13\n\fRaddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 674–76, 100 S. Ct. 2406, 2411–13 (1980). A district court\n\nis not required to rehear witness testimony when accepting a magistrate judge’s\n\ncredibility findings. Id. The Court explained:\n\n      [T]he statute calls for a de novo determination, not a de novo hearing.\n      We find nothing in the legislative history of the statute to support the\n      contention that the judge is required to rehear the contested testimony\n      in order to carry out the statutory command to make the required\n      “determination.”\n\nId. at 674, 100 S. Ct. at 2411. Not only that, but “to construe § 636(b)(1) to\n\nrequire the district court to conduct a second hearing whenever either party\n\nobjected to the magistrate’s credibility findings would largely frustrate the plain\n\nobjective of Congress to alleviate the increasing congestion of litigation in the\n\ndistrict courts.” Id. at 676 n.3, 100 S. Ct. at 2412 n.3.\n\n      While we have “held that generally a district court must rehear the disputed\n\ntestimony before rejecting a magistrate judge’s credibility determinations,” United\n\nStates v. Cofield, 272 F.3d 1303, 1306 (11th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added and\n\ncitations omitted), that is not what happened here. Because the district court\n\naccepted the magistrate judge’s findings, Raddatz controls, and no new hearing\n\nwas required. See Amlong & Amlong, P.A. v. Denny’s, Inc., 500 F.3d 1230, 1245\n\n(11th Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Dorvilus also contends that the district court failed to review de novo the\n\nparts of the record underlying the disputed conclusions in the R&R. The statutory\n\nobligation of the district court to give independent consideration to those portions\n\nof the R&R to which objection is made does require the court to consider the\n\nactual testimony relevant to the objections, and not merely the R&R. See Stokes\n\nv. Singletary, 952 F.2d 1567, 1576 (11th Cir. 1992). But the order denying the\n\nmotion to suppress indicates that the district court had conducted “a review of the\n\nrecord”—not merely the R&R, but “the record.” We believe the district judge did\n\nexactly what he says he did. See United States v. Williamson, 339 F.3d 1295,\n\n1305 n.18 (11th Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Hamell, 931 F.2d 466, 468\n\n(8th Cir. 1991).\n\n      Dorvilus further contends that he was entitled to a ruling on his motion to\n\nsuppress before the trial got underway. We review only for an abuse of discretion\n\na district court’s decision to reserve ruling on a pretrial motion until after the trial\n\nbegins. United States v. Beard, 761 F.2d 1477, 1479 (11th Cir. 1985). We have\n\nstated that “good cause for deferral exists only if facts at trial will be relevant to\n\nthe court’s decision, but a district court must rule on any issue entirely segregable\n\nfrom the evidence to be presented at trial.” United States v. Adkinson, 135 F.3d\n\n1363, 1369 n.11 (11th Cir. 1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted); see also\n\n                                           15\n\fFed. R. Crim. P. 12(d). Here, the facts at trial were not entirely segregable from\n\nthe motion to suppress. For example, during the trial defense counsel elicited\n\ntestimony that the officers did not perceive any threat to their safety during the\n\narrest, a fact relevant to whether the iPhone photos were the product of a search\n\nincident to a lawful arrest. That illustrated the good cause the district court had to\n\ndefer its ruling on the motion to suppress.2\n\n       Even if we were to conclude that the district court erred in deferring its\n\nruling on the motion to suppress, any resulting error was harmless because the jury\n\nnever saw any of the photographs. At oral argument, defense counsel argued that\n\nthe timing of the ruling was prejudicial, characterizing the risk of opening the door\n\nto the photos as a “sword of Damocles” that hung over the defense throughout the\n\ntrial. By that Dorvilus means that because there was no pretrial ruling he had to be\n\nconcerned that evidence he might present would open the door to admission of the\n\nphotos. The problem with that argument is the motion to suppress was denied, not\n\ngranted. Telling Dorvilus before trial that the motion was denied would only have\n\nsharpened the sword, not removed it.\n\n\n       2\n          Dorvilus argues that a pre-trial ruling was necessary because Rule 12(d) states that\n“[t]he court must not defer ruling on a pretrial motion if the deferral will adversely affect a\nparty’s right to appeal.” That exception is irrelevant to this case, because the timing of the\ndistrict court’s decision does not affect Dorvilus’ right to raise the suppression issue on appeal.\nSee United States v. Thompson, 558 F.2d 522, 525 (9th Cir. 1977).\n\n                                                 16\n\f       Dorvilus half-heartedly challenges the merits of the decision to deny his\n\nmotion to suppress, arguing that Diaz was not credible at the suppression hearing\n\nwhen he testified that the face page photo was visible as he took the iPhone from\n\nDorvilus’ pocket.3 The magistrate judge’s credibility determination, which the\n\ndistrict court adopted, is supported by the record and certainly was not “contrary to\n\nthe laws of nature” or “so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable\n\nfactfinder could accept it.” United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, 289 F.3d 744, 749\n\n(11th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). Because Diaz’s testimony is credible, we take\n\nas a fact that the face page photo was in plain view and the motion to suppress was\n\nproperly denied as to it. We need not decide whether the other photos were the\n\nproduct of a search incident to a lawful arrest because the possibility of the face\n\npage photo being admitted was enough to deter Dorvilus from changing his\n\ndefense strategy—even if all the other photos were due to be suppressed. Thus,\n\nDorvilus was not prejudiced by any error—if there be one—with regard to the\n\ntiming of the district court’s ruling on the motion to suppress.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Rulings on motions to suppress generally entail mixed questions of law and fact, so we\n“review a district court’s factual findings for clear error and its application of the law to those\nfacts de novo.” United States v. Tovar-Rico, 61 F.3d 1529, 1534 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n                                                 17\n\f                                          IV.\n\n      Leaving the timing of the ruling on the motion to suppress, which was based\n\non Fourth Amendment grounds, Dorvilus moves to the timing of the ruling on the\n\nmotion in limine, which was based on his Rule 404(b) and Rule 403 objections to\n\nthe admission of the iPhone photographs. He insists that the court should not have\n\nwaited until the end of the trial to rule on that motion. We review evidentiary\n\ndecisions only for abuse of discretion and cannot reverse “unless the ruling is\n\nmanifestly erroneous.” United States v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244, 1258 (11th Cir.\n\n2004) (en banc) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      The court clearly had good cause for not deciding this issue before trial, as\n\nDorvilus would have preferred. See United States v. Jernigan, 341 F.3d 1273,\n\n1286–87 (11th Cir. 2003) (“[O]ne of the primary components of the Rule 404(b)\n\ncalculus is the strength of the government’s evidence, a matter that plainly cannot\n\nbe properly ascertained until the trial itself.” (citation omitted)). A pre-trial ruling\n\nwould have been subject to change, in any event. See Luce v. United States, 469\n\nU.S. 38, 41–42, 105 S. Ct. 460, 463 (1984) (“[E]ven if nothing unexpected\n\nhappens at trial, the district judge is free, in the exercise of sound judicial\n\ndiscretion, to alter a previous in limine ruling.”); accord United States v. Hall, 312\n\nF.3d 1250, 1256 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                           18\n\f       Once the trial began, the court did not abuse its discretion by waiting to rule\n\non the admissibility of the photos until the other evidence was presented, because\n\nthe other evidence was relevant to the decision of the motion. Trial judges are not\n\nrequired to decide evidentiary issues in hypothetical terms, because “probativeness\n\nand prejudice” are “fact- and context-intensive inquiries that can only be\n\ncompetently made by the district court upon assessing first hand the evidence\n\npresented by both parties.” Jernigan, 341 F.3d at 1287; see also United States v.\n\nEllisor, 522 F.3d 1255, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008). The district court gave essentially\n\nthat rationale for its “wait and see” approach, and we conclude that its handling of\n\nthe motion was not an abuse of discretion.4\n\n       When the court did rule, it decided that the government could not introduce\n\nthe photos. That means that any error in deferring the ruling was harmless. The\n\ndefendant should not be heard to complain that if the court had ruled earlier he\n\nmight have put in some evidence helpful to his defense that he was afraid to put in\n\n\n\n       4\n          Dorvilus suggests that the district court’s finding that the government could not prove\nthat the photos depict real firearms undermines its rationale for deferring its ruling. But that\nargument overlooks the value to the government of introducing the photos to rebut suggestions\nthat the officers planted the gun or otherwise mishandled evidence. We doubt that a reasonable\njury would have believed, for example, that the officers planted a gun that just happened to\nresemble the “toy guns” with which the defendant was photographed. Dorvilus did not argue that\nthe government planted the Glock taken from his possession, but the possibility of such a defense\nwas one reason the district court adopted a wait-and-see approach rather than ruling early in the\ntrial.\n\n                                               19\n\fwithout assurance that it would not open the door to admission of the photos,\n\nbecause if the defendant had put on that other evidence the court would have been\n\nentitled to revisit and change its ruling. You put on your evidence and you take\n\nyour chances. Which is another way of saying that a defendant does not have a\n\nright to advice from the district court about how it will rule on evidentiary issues,\n\nespecially those that depend on how the evidence unfolds.\n\n                                                    V.\n\n         Dorvilus contends that the government presented an inadequate foundation\n\nfor admission of the firearm. At trial, Diaz testified that he had placed the firearm\n\nhe took from Dorvilus’ waistband into a plastic bag, which Detective Dweck\n\nbrought to his and Lang’s vehicle. Lang testified that he saw Dweck place the bag\n\ninto their vehicle. Lang completed the part of the property receipt where the\n\nmake, model, and serial number of the gun are listed. The serial number on the\n\nreceipt matches the serial number of the Glock firearm that was entered into\n\nevidence. Dweck’s name is listed as the swearing officer on the receipt, but he\n\ntestified at the suppression hearing that it was not his signature.5 Dorvilus argues\n\nthat the court erred in admitting the firearm because there was evidence of forgery.\n\n\n\n         5\n             Dweck was unable to testify at trial because his wife had a miscarriage on the first day\nof it.\n\n                                                    20\n\fWe review the district court’s ruling only for abuse of discretion. United States v.\n\nRussell, 703 F.2d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir. 1983).\n\n      Dorvilus’ argument fails because there “need be only some competent\n\nevidence in the record to support authentication” under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n901, and such evidence can be purely circumstantial. United States v. Hawkins,\n\n905 F.2d 1489, 1493 (11th Cir. 1990) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nAlthough testimony explaining why someone besides Dweck signed his name to\n\nthe receipt would have been helpful, Lang’s testimony with regard to the matching\n\nserial numbers was sufficient for purposes of Rule 901. As the district court\n\nnoted, Dorvilus was free to make his chain-of-custody arguments to the jury.\n\n“Challenge to the chain of custody goes to the weight rather than the admissibility\n\nof the evidence. Thus, the adequacy of the proof relating to the chain of custody is\n\nnot a proper ground to challenge the admissibility of the evidence.” United States\n\nv. Lopez, 758 F.2d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir. 1985) (citation omitted); see also United\n\nStates v. Roberson, 897 F.2d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir. 1990); United States v.\n\nCaldwell, 776 F.2d 989, 1001–02 (11th Cir. 1985); United States v. Clark, 664\n\nF.2d 1174, 1176 (11th Cir. 1981).\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f                                          VI.\n\n      Because of the imperfections in the evidence involving the handling of the\n\nGlock, Dorvilus contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n29. “We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict.” United States v. Thompson, 473 F.3d\n\n1137, 1142 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). “The jury gets to make any\n\ncredibility choices, and we will assume that they made them all in the way that\n\nsupports the verdict.” Id. (citation omitted). A reasonable jury could have\n\nbelieved that Diaz’s account of the arrest was credible and that the matching serial\n\nnumbers proved that the gun introduced at trial was the one taken from Dorvilus\n\nduring his arrest. Because the evidence supports the jury’s finding of guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, the district court correctly denied Dorvilus’ Rule 29 motion.\n\n                                         VII.\n\n      Dorvilus claims that the cumulative effect of any errors deprived him of a\n\nfair trial. Specifically, he argues that the district court’s exclusion of evidence of a\n\nfamily gathering, its denial of his request for a missing evidence instruction, and\n\nthe “errors” that we have already discussed amount to cumulative prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f       Dorvilus’ argument about the family gathering is that the district court\n\nshould have allowed him to put on evidence from some of those present at it that\n\nhe had been there shortly before the arrest. At trial, Dorvilus asserted that\n\nevidence was important because he was around many people at the gathering and\n\nthey could testify that he did not possess a firearm then. The district court saw a\n\ndisconnect between evidence showing that Dorvilus did not have a firearm in a\n\ngroup of individuals and the government’s allegation that he had a firearm later\n\ninside of a car. We see the same disconnect. Evidence of the family gathering had\n\nminimal relevance and might have only confused or misled the jury. It certainly\n\nwas not “manifestly erroneous” for the district court to so conclude. See Frazier,\n\n387 F.3d at 1258 (quotation marks and citation omitted).6\n\n       Dorvilus argues to us that evidence of the family gathering was also\n\nnecessary to counter the perception that he was involved in illegal activity at the\n\ntime of his arrest. He points out that the jury had these questions: “Is it possible\n\nto get information as to why was the defendant stopped? What was the lawful\n\narrest?” That argument is not properly before us because Dorvilus did not make it\n\nto the district court. In any event, with the parties’ agreement the court answered\n\n\n       6\n         Dorvilus argues in his brief, without citation to the record, that the family gathering was\n“only minutes” before Dorvilus left the hospital. We have found nothing in the record\nsupporting that statement, and he did not make that assertion to the district court anyway.\n\n                                                 23\n\fthe jury’s questions by informing it that the parties had stipulated that the arrest\n\nwas lawful and that the nature of the arrest was irrelevant. We must presume that\n\nthe jury followed that instruction. E.g., United States v. Stone, 9 F.3d 934, 938\n\n(11th Cir. 1993).\n\n      At trial, Dorvilus established that the officers used a radio frequency over\n\nwhich communications were not recorded, in violation of a departmental policy\n\nthat all radio communications should be recorded. Dorvilus argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his request for this jury instruction:\n\n      Where the government has intentionally or recklessly destroyed, suppressed, or\n      otherwise failed to preserve evidence that would be relevant to the issue of the\n      guilt or innocence of the defendant, you may infer that such evidence, if it were\n      produced, would be favorable to the defendant and adverse to the government.\n\nWe review the denial of a requested jury instruction only for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Morales, 978 F.2d 650, 652 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n      The district court did not abuse its discretion. Although “the defendant is\n\nentitled to have presented instructions relating to a theory of defense for which\n\nthere is any foundation in the evidence,” United States v. Lively, 803 F.2d 1124,\n\n1126 (11th Cir. 1986) (quotation marks and citation omitted), there was no basis in\n\nthe evidence for the requested instruction. The officers’ failure to create evidence\n\nby recording their conversations is simply not the same as destroying, suppressing,\n\nor failing to preserve existing evidence. Because there is no suggestion that the\n\n                                           24\n\fgovernment possessed any recordings or other materials that it refused to turn over\n\nto Dorvilus, the decisions he cites about missing or withheld evidence are\n\ninapposite. It would be legally incorrect for the jury to presume that recordings of\n\nthe officers’ conversations “would be favorable to the defendant” if they had been\n\ncreated. See United States v. Stone, 702 F.2d 1333, 1339 (11th Cir. 1983) (no\n\nreversible error if the requested instruction is incorrect). Moreover, Dorvilus’\n\nability to defend was not “seriously impaired” by the failure to give the requested\n\ninstruction. See id. The evidence supporting his theory was weak, at best,\n\nespecially because the officers testified that they thought their comments were\n\nbeing recorded.\n\n      Finally, Dorvilus argues that the cumulative effect of all these alleged errors\n\ndeprived him of his right to a fair trial. Because Dorvilus has not established that\n\nthe district court committed any reversible error, or that the alleged errors affected\n\nhis substantial rights, he cannot establish cumulative error. See United States v.\n\nHoffman-Vaile, 568 F.3d 1335, 1342 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                        VIII.\n\n      Dorvilus raises three additional issues, all of which clearly lack merit. First,\n\nhe contends that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) is unconstitutional under the Commerce\n\nClause, because it allegedly fails to require proof of a substantial nexus between\n\n                                          25\n\fthe offense and interstate commerce. As Dorvilus acknowledges in his brief, our\n\nbinding precedent forecloses that argument. See United States v. McAllister, 77\n\nF.3d 387, 389 (11th Cir. 1996). Dorvilus also makes an as-applied challenge to\n\nthe statute, which fails as well. Special Agent Murr testified that Dorvilus’ Glock\n\nwas manufactured in Austria and the ammunition was made outside of Florida.\n\n      Finally, Dorvilus contends that it was unconstitutional under the Fifth and\n\nSixth Amendments for the district court to raise his sentence based on prior\n\nconvictions not charged in the indictment, stipulated to, or proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt to a jury. Our precedent forecloses that claim. See United States\n\nv. Greer, 440 F.3d 1267, 1273–74 (11th Cir. 2006). We also note that Dorvilus\n\nadmitted to the existence and character of his prior convictions by failing to object\n\nto all but one of the convictions listed in his PSR. See United States v. Shelton,\n\n400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir. 2005). Moreover, his attorney conceded that\n\nDorvilus “qualified as an armed career criminal.”\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\f",

Goldberg, Judge, United States Court of International Trade,\nsitting by designation.\n\f       Maurice Dorvilus appeals his conviction and 204-month sentence for\n\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(e).\n\nAfter review, we affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       On the morning of April 22, 2008, Dorvilus’ 13-year-old son was struck by\n\na Miami-Dade police car while waiting at his school bus stop. Dorvilus spent the\n\nday at the hospital, where he was joined by other family members, and he left in\n\nthe evening. While he was driving to the store, Dorvilus failed to make a complete\n\nstop at a stop sign. Paul Villaverde, a detective for the Miami-Dade Police\n\nRobbery Investigation Unit, saw that traffic violation, discovered an outstanding\n\nwarrant for Dorvilus’ arrest, and called for backup. Detective Willy Diaz\n\nresponded, pulling up beside Dorvilus’ white Cadillac Escalade, which was parked\n\nat the store.\n\n       The officers arrested Dorvilus after he exited the store. While patting him\n\ndown, Diaz found a loaded .40 caliber Glock 27 handgun in Dorvilus’ waistband.\n\nAfter securing the gun and continuing the pat down, Diaz removed an Apple\n\niPhone from the right front pocket of Dorvilus’ pants. The cellular phone\n\ncontained roughly 600 photos, about 20 of which showed Dorvilus posing with\n\nmoney or what appeared to be firearms. One such photo was displayed on the\n\n                                         2\n\fiPhone’s “face page,” which is visible when the iPhone is turned on and one of its\n\nbuttons has been pressed. It showed Dorvilus holding what appear to be two\n\nhandguns while standing next to a white Cadillac Escalade.\n\n      Dorvilus filed a motion to suppress the photos. At the suppression hearing,\n\nDiaz testified that the face page photo was immediately visible as he took the\n\niPhone from Dorvilus’ pocket. As for the other photos, Diaz testified that he\n\nfound them by “unlocking” the iPhone and then scrolling through its photo\n\ndirectory. In his Report and Recommendation the magistrate judge found Diaz’s\n\naccount of the arrest to be credible and concluded that the motion to suppress\n\nshould be denied. The judge reasoned that there had been no “search” of the face\n\npage photo because it was in plain view, and the other photos were found by a\n\nsearch incident to a lawful arrest. Continuing to press his contention that the\n\nFourth Amendment required suppression of the photos, Dorvilus objected to the\n\nR&R. He also sought to achieve the same end by filing a motion in limine to\n\npreclude admission of the photos on Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 702\n\ngrounds. His position was that the photos were unfairly prejudicial, and that the\n\nexpert the government planned to use would not be able to positively identify any\n\ngun in the photos as the one seized from him at the time of his arrest.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      The district court did not rule on Dorvilus’ objections to the R&R or on his\n\nmotion in limine before trial. The court did hear arguments on the motion in\n\nlimine at the beginning of the trial but, viewing the photos as Rule 404(b)\n\nevidence, decided to wait until the court heard the government’s evidence. The\n\ncourt’s thinking apparently was that if the photos were not properly admissible\n\nunder Rule 404(b), the other issues about their admissibility would be moot. The\n\ncourt did say that it would issue an order on the motion to suppress, but it did not\n\ndo so during the trial. After hearing the other evidence, the court ruled from the\n\nbench that the photos could not be admitted under Rule 404(b). The jury found\n\nDorvilus guilty. Three months later, the court entered a written order, purporting\n\nto make it nunc pro tunc to the date the trial began, which denied the motion to\n\nsuppress, adopted the R&R over Dorvilus’ objections, and ruled that his\n\nobjections were moot because none of the photos had been admitted into evidence.\n\n      Because Dorvilus was classified as an armed career criminal under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e), he faced a 15-year minimum sentence. The court sentenced him\n\nto 204 months imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, and a\n\n$100 special assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                                               II.\n\n       Dorvilus first contends that the district court erred by failing to rule on\n\nwhether he had made a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination\n\nduring jury selection.

Three of those strikes were used to remove African\n\nAmericans from the jury and the fourth was against a non-African American.\n\nThere were at least two African Americans left on the jury; maybe more.1 And the\n\ngovernment had two strikes that it did not use. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(b)(2)\n\n(entitling the government to six peremptory challenges against regular jurors in a\n\nnon-capital felony case).\n\n       After the government used its first strike against an African American, the\n\ndefense began to object: “Defense would note for the record that Juror No. 13 is a\n\n\n       1\n          The government claims the jury included three African Americans, but the record is\nunclear. The government told the district court that “Jurors No. 14, 15, [whom] we didn’t\nstrike[,] are African-American women” and that “Juror No. 8 is an African-American man.”\nHowever, prospective Juror 15 was not on the list that the courtroom deputy called out of those\nwho had been selected to serve. At trial, the government did say, “Almost every juror in the back\nrow we didn’t strike is African-American,” but the record does not disclose how many jurors\nwere selected from those venire members on the back row. Thus, we know that the jury did\ninclude two African Americans (8 and 14) and there may have been others.\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fblack female and we’d ask the government—.” The court overruled the objection:\n\n“This is the first challenge, so there’s no pattern, so if you’re trying to raise a\n\nBatson issue at this early stage, overruled.” The defense did not object after any\n\nof the government’s next three strikes, two of which were also against African\n\nAmericans.\n\n      At that point, twelve jurors had been selected to serve, but the court\n\ncontinued the selection process in order to seat alternates. The court gave each\n\nparty two strikes and said that the alternate jurors would be the first two who were\n\nnot struck. The defense struck Juror 31. The government then expressed its\n\nintention to strike Juror 36, an African American. The following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Your Honor, just for the record, this is now—I believe Juror\n      No. 36 is a black female, so was Juror No. 17 and Juror 27.\n\n      MR. RASHBAUM: Your Honor, with all due respect, Jurors No. 14, 15, we\n      didn’t strike are African-American women. Almost every juror in the back row we\n      didn’t strike is African-American. Juror No. 8 is an African-American man.\n\n      THE COURT: I don’t even think we’re going to get to No. 36. Let me see.\n      Irregardless of your challenge, what is your next peremptory challenge?\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Juror 32, Ms. Delgado.\n\n      THE COURT: So the alternates are Gutierrez and Pintado and we don’t even reach\n      36, so it’s not necessary for me to even rule on the Batson challenge.\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Yes, sir.\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      THE COURT: All right. Thank you very much.\n\n      MS. BHARATHI: Thank you, Judge.\n\n      We review de novo the constitutional issues presented by a Batson\n\nchallenge, though we accord “great deference” to a district court’s ruling on\n\nwhether the objecting party established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nUnited States v.

All of that, however, assumes that Batson issues were preserved for\n\nappellate review by a proper objection.\n\n      We first address whether Dorvilus preserved by objection in the district\n\ncourt the Batson issues he is attempting to pursue before us. If he did not, our\n\nreview is only for plain error. See United States v. Dudley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77473\"><a href=\"/opinion/77473/united-states-v-tracey-dudley/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1227\n\n\n                                           7\n\f(11th Cir. 2006). Dorvilus did object after the government’s first strike, so any\n\nerror the court committed at that point is preserved. But the court correctly\n\noverruled that objection as premature because no prima facie case had been shown\n\nat that early stage. One strike does not a pattern make, and at that point there was\n\nno other indication that the government was discriminating against African\n\nAmericans.\n\n      Later, during the selection of alternates, when the government expressed its\n\nintention to strike Juror 36, defense counsel noted for the record that three of the\n\njurors the government had already struck were African Americans. Although the\n\ncourt interpreted that as a Batson objection, it viewed the objection as going only\n\nto Juror 36. That is apparent from the judge’s explanation a few minutes later that,\n\nbecause they had not reached Juror 36, it was unnecessary to rule on the objection.\n\nDorvilus’ counsel could have objected to the court’s failure to rule on her\n\nobjection if she had intended that the objection cover any of the earlier jurors who\n\nactually were struck, but she did not do that. Instead, she affirmatively agreed\n\nwith the court’s suggestion that the failure to reach Juror 36 made it unnecessary\n\nto rule on the Batson challenge. As a result, any error in the court’s failure to rule\n\nwas not properly preserved. Cf. Hopson v. Fredericksen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581572\"><a href=\"/opinion/581572/john-hopson-aka-kenneth-hayes-v-nicholas-fredericksen/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377–78\n\n(8th Cir. 1992) (“His failure to follow up on his Batson objection [after the\n\n                                           8\n\fgovernment offered race-neutral reasons for its strikes] could have been\n\nreasonably construed by the trial judge as an agreement that the expressed reasons\n\nwere racially neutral. Because Hopson failed to properly preserve this issue for\n\nappeal by failing to object at trial, we must review his claim under the plain error\n\nstandard.”).\n\n      Because Dorvilus did not properly preserve any error in the court’s failure\n\nto rule on whether he had established a prima face case of purposeful racial\n\ndiscrimination once the government made clear that it intended to strike Juror 36,\n\nif necessary, our review is only for plain error. “Before an error is subject to\n\ncorrection under the plain error rule, it must be plain under controlling precedent\n\nor in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule; it must have\n\nadversely affected the outcome of the proceedings; and it must be such that the\n\nfailure to correct it would seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.” United States v.

Even if it was error not to rule on\n\nwhether there was a prima facie case, and even if the error was plain, Dorvilus has\n\nnot established that there is a reasonable probability of a different result at his trial\n\nif the court had ruled. See United States v.

Dorvilus\n\nhas not established that if the court had ruled on whether he had established a\n\nprima facie case, the ruling would have been in his favor; nor has he established\n\nthat the government would not have been able to articulate a race-neutral\n\nexplanation for its strikes; nor has he established that he would have been able to\n\nconvince the court that the government’s reasons were pretextual.\n\n      We have held that “the unchallenged presence of two blacks on the jury\n\nundercuts any inference of impermissible discrimination that might be argued to\n\narise from the fact that the prosecutor used three of the four peremptory challenges\n\nhe exercised to strike blacks.” United States v.

We held in Dennis that the district court would have erred as a matter\n\nof law if it had found an inference of impermissible discrimination in these\n\n                                         10\n\fcircumstances. Dennis, 804 F.2d at 1211; see also Campa, 529 F.3d at 998.\n\nDorvilus invites us to reconsider Dennis and Campa, asserting that they are in\n\ntension with Supreme Court precedent. We cannot do that, because we are bound\n\nby our prior panel precedent. See, e.g., United States v. Emmanuel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78333\"><a href=\"/opinion/78333/united-states-v-emmanuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1332 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n      Dorvilus cites McGahee v. Alabama Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78318\"><a href=\"/opinion/78318/mcgahee-v-alabama-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2009), for the proposition that the district court’s failure to rule on\n\nwhether he made a prima facie showing under Batson was itself reversible error.\n\nIn McGahee we concluded that a state court unreasonably applied clearly\n\nestablished federal law by denying the defendant’s Batson challenge “based only\n\nupon the State’s proffer of generalized reasons for its peremptory challenges, and\n\nbecause the trial court failed to make any ruling following the State’s proffer of\n\nindividualized reasons for its peremptory challenges.” Id. at 1257. McGahee is\n\ndifferent from this case because it involved the failure of the district court to rule\n\nunder step three of the Batson framework—after the defendant had established a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination (step one) and the state had articulated a race-\n\nneutral explanation (step two). See id. at 1259 n.7 & 1260. At step three, “after a\n\nprosecutor has made his proffer of specific explanations, the trial court must make\n\na determination of whether the defendant has established purposeful\n\n                                           11\n\fdiscrimination.” Id. at 1260 (emphasis added); see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 98,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 1724; Allen-Brown, 243 F.3d at 1297. But in this case the district\n\ncourt never determined that there was a prima facie case, so McGahee’s discussion\n\nof what courts should do after they decide that a prima facie case has been\n\nestablished does not apply. See, e.g., United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792413\"><a href=\"/opinion/792413/united-states-v-fabio-ochoa-vasquez-aka-julio-aka-pepe-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1044 n.38 (11th Cir. 2005) (“[D]istrict courts usually make the\n\nprima-facie-case determination under Batson’s first prong. Yet, that is not\n\nnecessary if, as a matter of law, the defendant's evidence on the Batson issue is\n\ninsufficient to show a prima facie case.” (citations omitted)).\n\n          Moreover, it appears from the record that if the court had found a prima\n\nfacie case, the government would have been able to articulate race-neutral reasons\n\nfor striking the three African Americans it did. The father of Juror 13’s children\n\nwas incarcerated. Juror 17 had a family member involved in a criminal case a few\n\nyears ago, and she admitted that she has “some issues like about judging things\n\nthat I don’t know about and . . . a strong thing about going off my opinion about\n\nsituations.” Juror 27 was an investigator for the state public defender. (The\n\ngovernment did not actually strike Juror 36, but it would have had an obvious\n\nrace-neutral reason for doing so: her child was incarcerated at the time of the\n\ntrial.)\n\n                                            12\n\f      Not only that, but Dorvilus certainly has not established that if he had\n\ninsisted on his suggestion that there might be a Batson problem and if one or more\n\nof the government’s strikes had been disallowed, the result of the trial would have\n\nbeen different. As we explained in Rodriguez, “where we would have to\n\nspeculate—the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable\n\nprobability that the result would have been different but for the error; he has not\n\nmet his burden of showing prejudice; he has not met his burden of showing that\n\nhis substantial rights have been affected.” 398 F.3d at 1301. Dorvilus has not\n\nshown plain error.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      Dorvilus contends he was denied due process and his ability to present a\n\ndefense was hampered because the district court did not make “a de novo\n\ndetermination” of the disputed portions of the magistrate judge’s R&R on the\n\nmotion to suppress the photos on his iPhone. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) (“A judge\n\nof the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or\n\nspecified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.”).\n\n      Dorvilus argues that the district court judge could not accept the magistrate\n\njudge’s credibility findings without conducting a new evidentiary hearing. The\n\nSupreme Court has rejected that interpretation of § 636(b)(1). See United States v.\n\n                                         13\n\fRaddatz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110315\"><a href=\"/opinion/110315/united-states-v-raddatz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674–76, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110315\"><a href=\"/opinion/110315/united-states-v-raddatz/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

R. Crim. P. 12(d). Here, the facts at trial were not entirely segregable from\n\nthe motion to suppress. For example, during the trial defense counsel elicited\n\ntestimony that the officers did not perceive any threat to their safety during the\n\narrest, a fact relevant to whether the iPhone photos were the product of a search\n\nincident to a lawful arrest. That illustrated the good cause the district court had to\n\ndefer its ruling on the motion to suppress.2\n\n       Even if we were to conclude that the district court erred in deferring its\n\nruling on the motion to suppress, any resulting error was harmless because the jury\n\nnever saw any of the photographs. At oral argument, defense counsel argued that\n\nthe timing of the ruling was prejudicial, characterizing the risk of opening the door\n\nto the photos as a “sword of Damocles” that hung over the defense throughout the\n\ntrial. By that Dorvilus means that because there was no pretrial ruling he had to be\n\nconcerned that evidence he might present would open the door to admission of the\n\nphotos. The problem with that argument is the motion to suppress was denied, not\n\ngranted. Telling Dorvilus before trial that the motion was denied would only have\n\nsharpened the sword, not removed it.\n\n\n       2\n          Dorvilus argues that a pre-trial ruling was necessary because Rule 12(d) states that\n“[t]he court must not defer ruling on a pretrial motion if the deferral will adversely affect a\nparty’s right to appeal.” That exception is irrelevant to this case, because the timing of the\ndistrict court’s decision does not affect Dorvilus’ right to raise the suppression issue on appeal.\nSee United States v.

The district court gave essentially\n\nthat rationale for its “wait and see” approach, and we conclude that its handling of\n\nthe motion was not an abuse of discretion.4\n\n       When the court did rule, it decided that the government could not introduce\n\nthe photos. That means that any error in deferring the ruling was harmless.

But that\nargument overlooks the value to the government of introducing the photos to rebut suggestions\nthat the officers planted the gun or otherwise mishandled evidence. We doubt that a reasonable\njury would have believed, for example, that the officers planted a gun that just happened to\nresemble the “toy guns” with which the defendant was photographed. Dorvilus did not argue that\nthe government planted the Glock taken from his possession, but the possibility of such a defense\nwas one reason the district court adopted a wait-and-see approach rather than ruling early in the\ntrial.\n\n                                               19\n\fwithout assurance that it would not open the door to admission of the photos,\n\nbecause if the defendant had put on that other evidence the court would have been\n\nentitled to revisit and change its ruling.

At trial, Diaz testified that he had placed the firearm\n\nhe took from Dorvilus’ waistband into a plastic bag, which Detective Dweck\n\nbrought to his and Lang’s vehicle. Lang testified that he saw Dweck place the bag\n\ninto their vehicle. Lang completed the part of the property receipt where the\n\nmake, model, and serial number of the gun are listed. The serial number on the\n\nreceipt matches the serial number of the Glock firearm that was entered into\n\nevidence. Dweck’s name is listed as the swearing officer on the receipt, but he\n\ntestified at the suppression hearing that it was not his signature.5 Dorvilus argues\n\nthat the court erred in admitting the firearm because there was evidence of forgery.\n\n\n\n         5\n             Dweck was unable to testify at trial because his wife had a miscarriage on the first day\nof it.\n\n                                                    20\n\fWe review the district court’s ruling only for abuse of discretion.

(citation omitted). A reasonable jury could have\n\nbelieved that Diaz’s account of the arrest was credible and that the matching serial\n\nnumbers proved that the gun introduced at trial was the one taken from Dorvilus\n\nduring his arrest. Because the evidence supports the jury’s finding of guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, the district court correctly denied Dorvilus’ Rule 29 motion.\n\n                                         VII.\n\n      Dorvilus claims that the cumulative effect of any errors deprived him of a\n\nfair trial. Specifically, he argues that the district court’s exclusion of evidence of a\n\nfamily gathering, its denial of his request for a missing evidence instruction, and\n\nthe “errors” that we have already discussed amount to cumulative prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f       Dorvilus’ argument about the family gathering is that the district court\n\nshould have allowed him to put on evidence from some of those present at it that\n\nhe had been there shortly before the arrest. At trial, Dorvilus asserted that\n\nevidence was important because he was around many people at the gathering and\n\nthey could testify that he did not possess a firearm then. The district court saw a\n\ndisconnect between evidence showing that Dorvilus did not have a firearm in a\n\ngroup of individuals and the government’s allegation that he had a firearm later\n\ninside of a car. We see the same disconnect. Evidence of the family gathering had\n\nminimal relevance and might have only confused or misled the jury. It certainly\n\nwas not “manifestly erroneous” for the district court to so conclude. See Frazier,\n\n387 F.3d at 1258 (quotation marks and citation omitted).6\n\n       Dorvilus argues to us that evidence of the family gathering was also\n\nnecessary to counter the perception that he was involved in illegal activity at the\n\ntime of his arrest. He points out that the jury had these questions: “Is it possible\n\nto get information as to why was the defendant stopped? What was the lawful\n\narrest?” That argument is not properly before us because Dorvilus did not make it\n\nto the district court. In any event, with the parties’ agreement the court answered\n\n\n       6\n         Dorvilus argues in his brief, without citation to the record, that the family gathering was\n“only minutes” before Dorvilus left the hospital. We have found nothing in the record\nsupporting that statement, and he did not make that assertion to the district court anyway.\n\n                                                 23\n\fthe jury’s questions by informing it that the parties had stipulated that the arrest\n\nwas lawful and that the nature of the arrest was irrelevant. We must presume that\n\nthe jury followed that instruction. E.g., United States v.

Dorvilus argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his request for this jury instruction:\n\n      Where the government has intentionally or recklessly destroyed, suppressed, or\n      otherwise failed to preserve evidence that would be relevant to the issue of the\n      guilt or innocence of the defendant, you may infer that such evidence, if it were\n      produced, would be favorable to the defendant and adverse to the government.\n\nWe review the denial of a requested jury instruction only for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v.

The officers’ failure to create evidence\n\nby recording their conversations is simply not the same as destroying, suppressing,\n\nor failing to preserve existing evidence. Because there is no suggestion that the\n\n                                           24\n\fgovernment possessed any recordings or other materials that it refused to turn over\n\nto Dorvilus, the decisions he cites about missing or withheld evidence are\n\ninapposite. It would be legally incorrect for the jury to presume that recordings of\n\nthe officers’ conversations “would be favorable to the defendant” if they had been\n\ncreated. See United States v. Stone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415647\"><a href=\"/opinion/415647/the-united-states-of-america-v-john-w-stone-shirley-m-stone/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1339 (11th Cir. 1983) (no\n\nreversible error if the requested instruction is incorrect). Moreover, Dorvilus’\n\nability to defend was not “seriously impaired” by the failure to give the requested\n\ninstruction. See id. The evidence supporting his theory was weak, at best,\n\nespecially because the officers testified that they thought their comments were\n\nbeing recorded.\n\n      Finally, Dorvilus argues that the cumulative effect of all these alleged errors\n\ndeprived him of his right to a fair trial. Because Dorvilus has not established that\n\nthe district court committed any reversible error, or that the alleged errors affected\n\nhis substantial rights, he cannot establish cumulative error.

First,\n\nhe contends that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) is unconstitutional under the Commerce\n\nClause, because it allegedly fails to require proof of a substantial nexus between\n\n                                          25\n\fthe offense and interstate commerce. As Dorvilus acknowledges in his brief, our\n\nbinding precedent forecloses that argument. See United States v.

Dorvilus also makes an as-applied challenge to\n\nthe statute, which fails as well. Special Agent Murr testified that Dorvilus’ Glock\n\nwas manufactured in Austria and the ammunition was made outside of Florida.\n\n      Finally, Dorvilus contends that it was unconstitutional under the Fifth and\n\nSixth Amendments for the district court to raise his sentence based on prior\n\nconvictions not charged in the indictment, stipulated to, or proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt to a jury. Our precedent forecloses that claim. See United States\n\nv. Greer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1273–74 (11th Cir. 2006). We also note that Dorvilus\n\nadmitted to the existence and character of his prior convictions by failing to object\n\nto all but one of the convictions listed in his PSR. See United States v. Shelton,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76840\"><a href=\"/opinion/76840/united-states-v-terrance-shelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1330 (11th Cir. 2005). Moreover, his attorney conceded that\n\nDorvilus “qualified as an armed career criminal.”\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\f</pre>",
