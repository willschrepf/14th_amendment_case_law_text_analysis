Linda Bluestein, M.D., sued Central\nWisconsin Anesthesiology, S.C. (“Central Wisconsin”), for\n\f2                               Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the Americans With Disabilities\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29\nU.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. The district court concluded that\nBluestein, a full partner, shareholder, and member of the board\nof directors of Central Wisconsin, was an employer rather than\nan employee at the service corporation, and was thus ineligible\nfor the protections of those statutes. The court also found that\nBluestein’s claims would fail as a matter of law on the merits,\nand so the court granted summary judgment in favor of\nCentral Wisconsin. The court also ordered Bluestein and her\nattorney, Janet L. Heins, to pay attorneys’ fees to Central\nWisconsin for pursuing a frivolous lawsuit, pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k). Bluestein appeals the summary judg-\nment in favor of Central Wisconsin. Bluestein and Heins\nappeal the award of attorneys’ fees. Central Wisconsin also\nseeks attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 38 for defending this appeal. We affirm\nthe judgment and the award of fees in the district court. We\ndecline to award additional attorneys’ fees.\n                                   I.\n    Central Wisconsin is a service corporation organized under\nWisconsin law to engage in the practice of providing anesthe-\nsia services. See Wis. Stat. §§ 180.1901 - 180.1921. Bluestein is an\nanesthesiologist who began working for Central Wisconsin in\n1996 on a part-time basis. Her initial employment agreement\nidentified her as an employee, and she worked in that capacity\nfor approximately two and a half years. As of January 1, 1999,\nBluestein became a full partner of Central Wisconsin as well as\na shareholder and member of the board of directors, which is\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                                 3\n\ncomprised of all of the physician-shareholders. As a share-\nholder, she had a vote on all matters coming before the board.\nAfter a June 1999 board vote, Bluestein began receiving a\nquarterly distribution equal to that of the other shareholders.\nIn 2000, she was elected to the position of secretary-treasurer\nof the board, a post she held for approximately three years.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, she served as the chair of the compliance\ncommittee of the board.\n   The corporation was organized so that the physician-\nshareholders shared profits and losses equally.1 Board- and\ncommittee-approved policies applied uniformly to all of the\nshareholders and covered everything from compensation to\nvacation. Corporate bylaws provided when and how board\nmeetings were to be conducted. Most issues affecting the\nshareholders were resolved by a majority vote. For example,\n\n\n1\n  Although Bluestein denies in her briefs that profits were shared equally,\na review of her citations to the record reveals that she has no evidence to\nsupport this assertion. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 requires that a\nparty genuinely disputing a fact must support that assertion by citing to\nparticular parts of the record. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986)\n(in cases where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial\non a dispositive issue, when a summary judgment motion was properly\nmade in reliance on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, Rule 56(e) requires the nonmoving party to go\nbeyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the depositions,\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, designate specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial). Majors v. General Elec. Co.,\n714 F.3d 527, 540 (7th Cir. 2013) (conclusory statements unsupported by the\nrecord are insufficient to defeat summary judgment). We will not credit\nthose parts of Bluestein’s version of the facts that are not supported by any\nevidence in the record.\n\f4                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nwhen Bluestein wished to change her part-time status from\n80% to 90% in 2004, that change required approval from a\nmajority of the board. Bluestein participated in many meetings\nwhere key company issues were decided by a majority vote,\nincluding setting wage increases for non-physician staff,\nsetting anesthesia fees and policies, changing office computer\ntechnology, changing the shareholders’ deferred compensation\nand increasing paid vacation for the shareholders from ten\nweeks to twelve weeks per year.\n    In the fall of 2009, Bluestein sustained injuries in a kayak\naccident. She developed ischiogluteal bursitis, proximal\nhamstring tendinopathy, sciatica and sacral nerve root cyst.\nThese conditions made it difficult for her to complete her work\nas an anesthesiologist. Over the next several months, she\nintermittently took approved time off to rest and recover but\nshe did not heal enough to return to work at full strength. In\nAugust 2010, she sent her partners a letter setting forth her\nstatus:\n     Dear colleagues:\n     As you are probably aware, I am continuing to\n     struggle with a condition with my hamstring ten-\n     don.\n     I have just finished my recommended month off to\n     allow for healing and recovery. Unfortunately, this\n     has not led to the improvement we had hoped for. I\n     have been advised by my treating doctor that the\n     best course of action at this time would be for me to\n     take an open ended medical leave of absence in\n     order that I may continue to pursue the necessary\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                               5\n\n     treatment options without exacerbating my condi-\n     tion further. At this time, my treating doctor and I\n     share in the realization that I am unable to meet the\n     physical demands of practicing anesthesia. I truly\n     apologize for any and all inconveniences that my\n     disabled condition has caused you.\n     Thank you for your understanding and patience. I\n     hope to return to work soon.\nR. 45-33. After requesting this open-ended leave from her\nfellow physician-shareholders, the board voted to deny the\nrequest. The board then held a second vote, presenting\nshareholders with two additional options. The first would have\ngranted Bluestein a four-month leave of absence on the\ncondition that she would be terminated if she could not\nperform her duties as an anesthesiologist without restriction\nupon her return. Under the second option, Bluestein would be\nallowed to resign as of August 31, 2010, but would be termi-\nnated if her letter of resignation was not received by September\n16, 2010. Four shareholders voted in favor of the four-month\nleave and twelve chose the latter option. When Bluestein did\nnot resign by September 16, 2010, she was terminated the next\nday. Shortly thereafter, the board voted to give Bluestein her\ndeferred compensation as calculated by the firm’s deferred\ncompensation formula.\n    Bluestein sued Central Wisconsin for violations of the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the Rehabilitation\nAct and Title VII. The district court granted Central Wiscon-\nsin’s motion for summary judgment on multiple grounds.\nFirst, the court concluded that Bluestein was an employer at\n\f6                              Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nCentral Wisconsin rather than an employee, and thus was not\nentitled to the protection of the statutes at issue. Although that\nconclusion was fatal to all of Bluestein’s claims, the court also\nconsidered each discrimination claim on its merits. The court\nrejected Bluestein’s ADA claim because she had produced no\nevidence to demonstrate that she had a substantial limitation\nin any major life activity and thus was not disabled as that\nterm is defined by the statute. Moreover, she had notified her\ncolleagues that she was unable to perform the essential\nfunctions of her job and therefore was not a qualified individ-\nual with a disability unless there was a reasonable accommo-\ndation that would allow her to fulfill her job duties. The court\nfound that she failed to demonstrate that a four-month leave\nwould have enabled her to return to work and that the open-\nended leave request was unreasonable as a matter of law. The\ncourt similarly concluded that her claim of sex discrimination\nfailed because she produced no evidence that the disabled\nmale colleague to whom she compared herself was similarly\nsituated. The court summarily rejected the Rehabilitation Act\nclaim because Bluestein lacked evidence that Central Wiscon-\nsin receives federal financial assistance, a requirement for\nrecovery under that statute. In response to Central Wisconsin’s\nmotion for attorneys’ fees, the court agreed that Bluestein’s\nlawsuit was “frivolous, unreasonable and without founda-\ntion.” Bluestein v. Central Wisconsin Anesthesiology, P.C., 2014\nWL 61157, *2 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 8, 2014). Acknowledging that an\naward of fees should be rare in discrimination cases, the court\nnevertheless concluded that fees were appropriate in this case\nbecause “a reasonable amount of legal research should have\nalerted counsel to the implausibility of success on any of\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                   7\n\nplaintiff’s claims of discrimination.” Id. The court found that it\nwas unreasonable for Bluestein to think that she could prevail\non “clearly frivolous claims of discrimination” because she\nshould have known she was not an “employee” of Central\nWisconsin and because she had admitted to her colleagues that\nshe could not perform the essential functions of her job. Id. The\ncourt therefore ordered Bluestein and her attorney to pay\nCentral Wisconsin’s attorneys’ fees. Bluestein and her counsel\nappeal.\n                                  II.\n    On appeal, Bluestein contends that she was an employee\nfor the purposes of the statutes at issue. She also maintains that\nshe has raised genuine issues of material fact regarding her\ndisability and sex discrimination claims. Finally, she asserts\nthat the district court abused its discretion in awarding\nattorneys’ fees to the defendant. We review the district court's\ngrant of summary judgment de novo, examining the record in\nthe light most favorable to Bluestein and construing all\nreasonable inferences from the evidence in her favor. Anderson\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986); Naficy v. Illinois\nDep't of Human Servs., 697 F.3d 504, 509 (7th Cir. 2012);\nNorman–Nunnery v. Madison Area Technical Coll., 625 F.3d 422,\n428 (7th Cir. 2010). Summary judgment is appropriate when\nthere are no genuine disputes of material fact and the movant\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a);\nNaficy, 697 F.3d at 509. Central Wisconsin sought and was\ngranted fees as a prevailing party pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\f8                                   Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\n§ 2000e-5(k).2 We review the district court’s grant of attorneys’\nfees under that provision for abuse of discretion. Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 434\nU.S. 412, 421 (1978); Munson v. Milwaukee Bd. of School Directors,\n969 F.2d 266, 269 (7th Cir. 1992) (district courts are given wide\nlatitude to determine whether an award of fees to prevailing\ndefendants is appropriate in a given case, and we will reverse\na decision to award fees to a prevailing defendant only upon\na showing of abuse of discretion by the district court).\n                                      A.\n    The threshold question for Bluestein’s claims is whether she\nis an “employee” protected by the statutes at issue. Each of the\nstatutes invoked by Bluestein protects employees (and others\nnot at issue here, such as job applicants) from discrimination\nby employers. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a);3 29 U.S.C. § 794(d);4\n\n\n\n\n2\n  That subsection provides, in relevant part: “In any action or proceeding\nunder this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing\nparty … a reasonable attorney's fee … as part of the costs[.]”\n\n3\n  The statute provides: “No covered entity shall discriminate against a\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application\nprocedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee\ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of\nemployment.”\n\n4\n   That section of the Rehabilitation Act directs that courts employ the\nstandards applied under the ADA to determine whether the Rehabilitation\nAct has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination.\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                                 9\n\n42 U.S.C. 2000e-2.5 But the definition of “employee” in each\nstatute is vague and circular. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (“The term\n‘employee’ means an individual employed by an employer.”);\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f) (same). See also Clackamas Gastroenterology\nAssociates, P.C. v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440, 444 (2003) (noting that the\ndefinition of “employee” in the ADA is circular). “Employer”\nis defined in the ADA as “a person engaged in an industry\naffecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each\nworking day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the\ncurrent or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such\nperson.” 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(A).\n    When faced with the question of determining the meaning\nof the term “employee” in the context of the ADA, the Su-\npreme Court reasoned that, when a statute does not provide a\nworking definition, the courts should turn to the common law\ntest for determining who qualifies as an employee. Clackamas,\n538 U.S. at 444-45. Clackamas presented a scenario that was\nremarkably similar to the circumstances at Central Wisconsin.\nIn that case, a bookkeeper sued a medical clinic for disability\ndiscrimination under the ADA. Because the ADA applies only\nto employers whose workforce includes fifteen or more\n\n\n5\n  The statute provides: “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\nemployer– (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or\notherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\nsuch individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (2) to limit,\nsegregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”\n\f10                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nemployees, it was necessary to determine how many “em-\nployees” the clinic employed during the relevant time period.\nThis in turn depended on whether the “four physicians\nactively engaged in medical practice as shareholders and\ndirectors of a professional corporation should be counted as\n‘employees.’” 538 U.S. at 442. The Court noted that it had\npreviously adopted the common law test to determine who\nqualifies as an employee for the purposes of the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). But the\ndefendant-clinic in Clackamas encouraged the Court to reject\nthe common law analysis in the ADA context and instead\nconclude that the shareholder-directors were more analogous\nto partners in a partnership than to shareholders in a corpora-\ntion. Partners, the clinic argued, were employers rather than\nemployees. The Court rejected the clinic’s assertion, noting that\npartnerships sometimes include hundreds of members, some\nof whom would easily qualify as employees when control is\nconcentrated in a small number of managing partners. 538 U.S.\nat 445-46.\n   Instead, the Court returned to the common law definition\nof “servant” in determining whether an individual is an\nemployee. Clackamas, 538 U.S. at 448. Under the common law\ndefinition, a servant is a person whose work is controlled or is\nsubject to a right to control by the master. Based on the\nRestatement (Second) of Agency, §§ 2(2) and 220(2)(a), the\nCourt remarked that the element of control should be the\nprincipal guidepost in assessing whether a person is an\nemployee. 538 U.S. at 448. The Court then adopted a non-\nexclusive list of six factors designed to reflect the common law\nelement of control:\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                11\n\n     Whether the organization can hire or fire the indi-\n     vidual or set the rules and regulations of the individ-\n     ual's work;\n     Whether and, if so, to what extent the organization\n     supervises the individual's work;\n     Whether the individual reports to someone higher in\n     the organization;\n     Whether and, if so, to what extent the individual is\n     able to influence the organization;\n     Whether the parties intended that the individual be\n     an employee, as expressed in written agreements or\n     contracts; and\n     Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses,\n     and liabilities of the organization.\nClackamas, 538 U.S. at 449-50. In contrast,\n     an employer is the person, or group of persons, who\n     owns and manages the enterprise. The employer can\n     hire and fire employees, can assign tasks to employ-\n     ees and supervise their performance, and can decide\n     how the profits and losses of the business are to be\n     distributed. The mere fact that a person has a partic-\n     ular title—such as partner, director, or vice\n     president—should not necessarily be used to deter-\n     mine whether he or she is an employee or a propri-\n     etor. … Nor should the mere existence of a docu-\n     ment styled “employment agreement” lead inexora-\n     bly to the conclusion that either party is an em-\n     ployee.\n\f12                              Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\n538 U.S. at 450. When deciding whether shareholder-directors\nwere employees, no one factor should be decisive, the Court\nemphasized, but all aspects of the relationship should be\nconsidered. 538 U.S. at 451. See also Smith v. Castaways Family\nDiner, 453 F.3d 971, 977 (7th Cir. 2006) (no one factor is disposi-\ntive and a court must look to all aspects of the relationship\nbetween the shareholder-director and the organization to\ndecide whether the shareholder-director exerts control or has\nthe right to exert control over the organization).\n    With those standards in mind, the question for Bluestein is\nwhether she raised a genuine issue of material fact on the issue\nof her status as an employee. As we noted above, she was a\nshareholder and member of the board of directors at Central\nWisconsin, entitled to vote on all issues coming before the\nboard and subject to the same board-and committee-approved\npolicies as every other physician-shareholder of the service\ncorporation. There were approximately sixteen physician-\nshareholders at the time of Bluestein’s termination. Turning to\nthe first part of the first factor, whether the organization can\nhire or fire the individual, the record demonstrated that hiring\nand firing decisions were made collectively by the shareholder-\nboard members. Indeed, Bluestein herself voted on her own\ntermination. Clackamas, 538 U.S. at 450 (an employer can hire\nand fire employees). That she was in the minority of that vote\ndoes not diminish her right of control on hiring and firing; the\nright to cast a vote equal to that of any other board member\nunequivocally indicates that Bluestein was an employer rather\nthan an employee for the purposes of hiring and firing. Solon\nv. Kaplan, 398 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir. 2005) (shareholder’s\ncontention that he was outvoted does not undermine conclu-\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                              13\n\nsion that he was an employer when he had an equal right to\nvote); Schmidt v. Ottawa Medical Center, P.C., 322 F.3d 461, 467\n(7th Cir. 2003) (physician-shareholder with equal vote is\nemployer notwithstanding his repeated inability to secure the\nmajority opinion of his fellow shareholders).\n    Bluestein fares no better on the second part of the first\nfactor, namely, whether the organization set the rules and\nregulations of the individual's work. Bluestein complains that,\nunder various policies adopted by the board and its subcom-\nmittees, she could not unilaterally take a vacation day, set her\nown schedule, assign cases to herself, or decide when she\ncould take her lunch or a break. Again, the undisputed record\ndemonstrates that it was not the “organization” but the\nphysician-shareholders who collectively voted at board\nmeetings on the rules and regulations that governed all of the\nstaff. Bluestein herself participated in board meetings and\ncommittee meetings where she voted on issues relating to\ncompensation, vacation policy and other workplace issues.\nUnlike the non-physician staff members at Central Wisconsin,\nas a full board member, Bluestein was one of the decision-\nmakers who determined the rules and regulations that gov-\nerned her own work and the work of others at the organiza-\ntion. Moreover, under the bylaws, any physician-shareholder\nwho could secure the support of a sufficient number of board\nmembers could challenge and change those policies.\n   Turning to the second factor, whether the organization\nsupervises the individual's work, Bluestein presented no\nevidence that anyone at Central Wisconsin supervised her\nwork as an anesthesiologist. Bluestein asserts as evidence of\nsupervision that she could not change her part-time work\n\f14                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nschedule from 80% to 90% without board approval. Nor could\nshe unilaterally take a leave of absence or decide upon and\nimplement her own disability accommodations. We note first\nthat these are not matters relating to the supervision of her\nwork as an anesthesiologist but are more in the nature of the\ngeneral office rules and policies that we addressed in the first\nfactor. The salient point is that Bluestein could point to no\nsupervisor at Central Wisconsin who dictated how Bluestein\npracticed anesthesiology. As a physician, she determined how\nto complete the specific tasks of her work. Bluestein has\nproduced no evidence that anyone at Central Wisconsin had a\nright to control the details of her work. See Clackamas, 538 U.S.\nat 448 (in distinguishing between servants and independent\ncontractors, the extent of control one may exercise over the\ndetails of the work of the other is a primary consideration);\nSchmidt, 322 F.3d at 467 (where service corporation’s board\nassigns patients to physicians, and physician then has absolute\nauthority for the treatment of those patients, the physician is an\nemployer rather than an employee, especially where the\nphysician exercises as much control over his employment as\nany other member of the physician-shareholder board).\nBluestein thus fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact on\nthe question of supervision.\n   Bluestein treats the third factor—whether the individual\nreports to someone higher in the organization—as essentially\nco-extensive with the test for supervision. She asserts that one\nphysician, Dr. Mason, was the chair of the board for eleven\nyears, that he intimidated and discouraged others from\nrunning for the post of chair, and that he failed to follow the\nbylaws requirement of holding an election every two years.\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                               15\n\nBluestein claims that she was required to seek approval from\nMason or another physician for days off, and that a committee\nof which she was not a member determined doctors’ schedules\nand patient assignments. But all of this was the result of the\ncollective action (or inaction) of Bluestein’s fellow physician-\nshareholders. That Bluestein was in a minority position on how\nthe service corporation organized schedules, patient assign-\nments and time off is irrelevant to her right to an equal vote on\nthese issues as a shareholder. None of this evidence addresses\nwhether she “reported to” someone higher in the organization.\nInstead, the evidence demonstrates that each physician-\nshareholder had an equal vote in matters affecting the organi-\nzation. That some functions or control may have been dele-\ngated to the board chair is irrelevant because Bluestein had an\nequal vote in the delegation. Nor does it matter for the pur-\nposes of determining her status as an employee that Dr. Mason\nappeared to have great influence with his colleagues. Under\nthe bylaws, the shareholders were free to delegate authority to\none of their members and just as free to retract that delegation.\nBut each shareholder, including Bluestein, had an equal vote.\nOnce again, that she was in the minority view does not detract\nfrom her right of control.\n    The fourth factor is whether and to what extent an individ-\nual is able to influence the organization. Bluestein asserts that\nshe had no authority, control or influence over the board. But\nshe bases this assertion on the same evidence that we found\ninadequate above. She does not dispute on appeal that she was\na full member of the board and an equal shareholder entitled\nto vote on all matters coming before the board. Instead, she\nessentially alleges that she frequently found herself in the\n\f16                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nminority position on how her colleagues decided to run the\nbusiness. Not winning the vote is not the same as not having\na vote, however, and it is her opportunity for shared control\nthat counts when determining whether she was an employer\nor employee. See Schmidt, 322 F.3d at 468 (“when an individual\nclaimant-shareholder enjoys the opportunity for shared control\nof the closely held professional corporation, including the\nopportunity to share in its profits, we will treat him or her as\na bona fide employer for purposes of the ADEA.”).\n    As the district court noted, Bluestein’s situation was\nmarkedly different from that of the thirty-two partners\ndemoted from full partnership in EEOC v. Sidley Austin Brown\n& Wood, 315 F.3d 696 (7th Cir. 2002). In that case, a large law\nfirm consisting of more than 500 partners demoted thirty-two\npartners who then sued the firm under the Age Discrimination\nin Employment Act. Unlike Central Wisconsin, the law firm\nwas controlled by a small, self-perpetuating executive commit-\ntee that held the power to hire, fire, promote and determine the\ncompensation of the partners who were not on the committee.\nAlthough all partners shared the firm’s liabilities in proportion\nto their share of capital in the firm, profits were distributed\naccording to a formula determined by the executive committee.\nAll of the firm’s committees were subject to the control of the\nexecutive committee, which appointed all of the members of\nother committees. The partners did not elect the members of\nthe executive committee; instead, the executive committee\ndetermined its own membership. The thirty-two demoted\npartners thus had no voting power and no control over their\nfate at the firm. The only issue on which the entire partnership\nvoted related to a merger with another firm. Otherwise, the\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                             17\n\nexecutive committee controlled the running of the firm. We\nheld that not all partners should be deemed employers as a\nmatter of law. 315 F.3d at 702. Rather, some shareholders of a\nprofessional corporation may be considered employees for the\npurposes of federal anti-discrimination law. 315 F.3d at 703.\nThe manner of sharing profits and liabilities, the partners’\nability to control their own fates, and the amount of control\npartners had to conduct their own work all contributed to the\nanalysis of whether these thirty-two partners were employers\nor employees. We remanded to the district court to allow for\ndiscovery on those issues.\n    In contrast, Central Wisconsin was run by a sixteen-\nmember board that consisted of all of the physician-sharehold-\ners, not some exclusive subset of them. All major decisions\nwere put to a vote and each shareholder had an equal vote.\nBoth profits and losses were shared equally. Bluestein enjoyed\nthe same right of control that every other physician-share-\nholder possessed. She possessed no more or less of a right to\ninfluence the organization than any other partner.\n   Turning to the fifth factor—whether the parties intended\nthe individual to be an employee, as expressed in written\nagreements or contracts—we will assume that the contract\nBluestein signed before she became a full shareholder was still\nin effect at the time of her termination from the service\ncorporation. That contract referred to Bluestein as an em-\nployee. Bluestein also notes that she received a W-2 form\nindicating her wages annually. But the Clackamas Court\ncautioned that “the mere existence of a document styled\n‘employment agreement’ [should not] lead inexorably to the\nconclusion that either party is an employee.” Clackamas, 538\n\f18                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nU.S. at 450-51. And we found that the physician-shareholder in\nSchmidt was an employer even though he had an employment\nagreement with the professional corporation that described\nhim repeatedly as an employee and even though he received\na base salary reported on a W-2. Schmidt was an employer, we\nfound, because he shared in the management and control of\nthe professional corporation throughout his career, and was a\nshareholder, a corporate officer, a board member and a director\nthroughout his tenure. As a shareholder, he possessed an equal\nvote in all matters put to a shareholder vote and had a voice in\nall matters put before the board. 322 F.3d at 467. Like Bluestein,\nhe frequently found himself in the minority position on the\nvotes of his fellow shareholders but that did not alter the fact\nthat he had the right to exercise control with each vote and had\nan opportunity to participate in revising and voting on board\nplans with which he disagreed. Id. Like Bluestein, Schmidt did\nnot possess sole authority over the conditions of his employ-\nment but rather shared that authority in equal parts with other\nmembers of the board. Like Bluestein, Schmidt exercised as\nmuch control over his employment as any other shareholder.\n322 F.3d at 467. These factors, considered as a whole, overcame\nthe simple labeling of Schmidt as an employee in the employ-\nment agreement. 322 F.3d at 468 (“when an individual claim-\nant-shareholder enjoys the opportunity for shared control of\nthe closely held professional corporation, including the\nopportunity to share in its profits, we will treat him or her as\na bona fide employer for purposes of the ADEA”). Under our\nreasoning in Schmidt, the language in Bluestein’s contract\ncannot overcome the reality of her position in the professional\ncorporation.\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                  19\n\n    Finally, Bluestein failed to raise a genuine issue of material\nfact on the sixth factor, whether an individual shares in the\nprofits, losses and liabilities of the organization. In addressing\nthe sixth factor, Bluestein baldly asserts in her brief that she did\nnot share equally in the profits and losses of Central Wisconsin.\nBut a review of her citations to the record reveals no evidence\nin support of that assertion. She therefore raises no genuine\nissue of material fact on the sixth factor. See supra note 1.\n    Taking all six factors as a whole, we conclude that Bluestein\nwas an employer as a matter of law. In sum, she was a full\nphysician-shareholder and board member in a small medical\nprofessional corporation. She had an equal right to vote on all\nmatters coming before the board, shared equally in the firm’s\nprofits and liabilities, and participated in decisions to hire and\nfire employees. She even voted on her own termination.\nAlthough she was subject to general workplace policies\nregarding her hours, vacation, scheduling and patient assign-\nments, all the physician-shareholders were subject to the same\npolicies, and all had an equal right to influence those policies.\nShe reported to no one and the details of her work as an\nanesthesiologist were not supervised or controlled by anyone\nat the firm. Although she often found herself in the minority\nposition among her fellow physician-shareholders, it is her\nright of control that matters to the analysis. Our conclusion that\nshe was an employer is fatal to all of her discrimination claims.\nWe therefore need not consider the merits of the individual\ndiscrimination claims and we affirm summary judgment in\nfavor of Central Wisconsin.\n\f20                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\n                                 B.\n    Bluestein and her lawyer also appeal the district court’s\naward of attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), a\ndetermination that we review for abuse of discretion.\nChristiansburg Garment, 434 U.S. at 421; Munson, 969 F.2d at\n269. “[A] district court may in its discretion award attorney's\nfees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon a finding\nthat the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or\nwithout foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad\nfaith.” Christiansburg Garment, 434 U.S. at 421.\n    In analyzing the request for fees, the district court re-\ncounted its conclusions on summary judgment: (1) that the\nundisputed facts demonstrated that Bluestein was an employer\nrather than an employee; (2) that she failed to produce any\nevidence that Central Wisconsin received financial assistance\nfrom the federal government, a requirement for suits under the\nRehabilitation Act; (3) that she did not demonstrate that she\nwas disabled within the meaning of the ADA because she\nproduced no evidence of a substantial limitation in a major life\nactivity; (4) that she did not show what reasonable accommo-\ndation the defendant could have provided her; (5) that she did\nnot demonstrate that she was a “qualified individual” under\nthe ADA and instead failed to acknowledge her admission to\nher fellow shareholders that she was unable to meet the\nphysical demands of practicing anesthesia; (6) that she did not\nestablish that the extended or indefinite leave of absence she\nrequested was a reasonable accommodation in light of circuit\nlaw to the contrary; and (7) that she did not raise a genuine\nissue of material fact on her claim of sex discrimination. The\ncourt also noted that a reasonable amount of legal research\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                21\n\nshould have alerted counsel to the implausibility of success on\nthe merits of any of her claims. The combination of these\nfactors led the court to conclude that Bluestein’s suit was\nfrivolous, unreasonable and without foundation, and that an\naward of fees was appropriate in this instance.\n     Bluestein cites “two glaring features” of the district court\nrecord that she contends require reversal of the award of fees.\nFirst, the district court denied Central Wisconsin’s motion to\ndismiss the case, and second, neither the court nor the defen-\ndant ever hinted prior to summary judgment that they consid-\nered the case frivolous. The motion to dismiss, however, was\nbased not on the merits of the suit but on the plaintiff’s failure\nto cooperate with discovery. The court denied that motion\nbecause it concluded that lesser sanctions would be adequate\nto remedy the plaintiff’s discovery violations. There was no\nreason for the court to address the merits of the suit at that\ntime. And Bluestein does not explain why it was improper for\nthe defendant to await the factual development of the case and\nsummary judgment before seeking fees. In any case, the\ndefendant alerted the plaintiff that it considered the suit\nfrivolous when it filed its answer to the complaint early in the\nlitigation. “Abuse of discretion exists only where the result is\nnot one that could have been reached by a reasonable jurist or\nwhere the decision of the trial court strikes us as fundamen-\ntally wrong or is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful.”\nGreviskes v. Universities Research Ass'n, Inc., 417 F.3d 752, 758\n(7th Cir. 2005). A reasonable jurist could conclude that\nBluestein’s suit was frivolous, unreasonable and without\nfoundation, and we therefore affirm the award of attorneys’\nfees.\n\f22                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\n                                 C.\n    Finally, Central Wisconsin has moved for attorneys’ fees on\nappeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.\nThat rule provides that if “a court of appeals determines that\nan appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or\nnotice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond,\naward just damages and single or double costs to the appel-\nlee.” Fed. R. App. P. 38. An appeal is frivolous within the\nmeaning of Rule 38 when it is prosecuted with no reasonable\nexpectation of altering the district court's judgment and for\npurposes of delay or harassment or out of sheer obstinacy.\nWachovia Securities, LLC v. Loop Corp., 726 F.3d 899, 909-10 (7th\nCir. 2013); Giannopoulos v. Brach & Brock Confections, Inc., 109\nF.3d 406, 412 (7th Cir. 1997); Flexible Mfg. Systems Pty. Ltd. v.\nSuper Products Corp., 86 F.3d 96, 101 (7th Cir. 1996). See also\nLorentzen v. Anderson Pest Control, 64 F.3d 327, 331 (7th Cir.\n1995) (an appeal is frivolous for the purposes of Rule 38 when\nthe result is obvious or when the appellant's arguments are\nwholly without merit; at times, we have also required some\nevidence of bad faith before finding that sanctions should be\nimposed). Rule 38 is permissive rather than mandatory, and so\nwe may decline to impose fees even if we find that an appeal\nis frivolous. See e.g. Lorentzen, 64 F.3d at 331. Poor judgment\nmay have driven the appeal here but we see no evidence of\nbad faith, harassment or obstinacy. Lorentzen, 64 F.3d at 331.\nThe sanctions below were substantial and no useful purpose\nwould be served in ordering the plaintiff to pay further\nattorneys’ fees to Central Wisconsin. The plaintiff shall bear the\ndefendant’s costs on appeal.                          AFFIRMED.\n\f",

The district court concluded that\nBluestein, a full partner, shareholder, and member of the board\nof directors of Central Wisconsin, was an employer rather than\nan employee at the service corporation, and was thus ineligible\nfor the protections of those statutes. The court also found that\nBluestein’s claims would fail as a matter of law on the merits,\nand so the court granted summary judgment in favor of\nCentral Wisconsin. The court also ordered Bluestein and her\nattorney, Janet L. Heins, to pay attorneys’ fees to Central\nWisconsin for pursuing a frivolous lawsuit, pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k). Bluestein appeals the summary judg-\nment in favor of Central Wisconsin. Bluestein and Heins\nappeal the award of attorneys’ fees. Central Wisconsin also\nseeks attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 38 for defending this appeal. We affirm\nthe judgment and the award of fees in the district court. We\ndecline to award additional attorneys’ fees.\n                                   I.\n    Central Wisconsin is a service corporation organized under\nWisconsin law to engage in the practice of providing anesthe-\nsia services. See Wis. Stat. §§ 180.1901 - 180.1921. Bluestein is an\nanesthesiologist who began working for Central Wisconsin in\n1996 on a part-time basis. Her initial employment agreement\nidentified her as an employee, and she worked in that capacity\nfor approximately two and a half years. As of January 1, 1999,\nBluestein became a full partner of Central Wisconsin as well as\na shareholder and member of the board of directors, which is\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                                 3\n\ncomprised of all of the physician-shareholders. As a share-\nholder, she had a vote on all matters coming before the board.\nAfter a June 1999 board vote, Bluestein began receiving a\nquarterly distribution equal to that of the other shareholders.\nIn 2000, she was elected to the position of secretary-treasurer\nof the board, a post she held for approximately three years.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, she served as the chair of the compliance\ncommittee of the board.\n   The corporation was organized so that the physician-\nshareholders shared profits and losses equally.1 Board- and\ncommittee-approved policies applied uniformly to all of the\nshareholders and covered everything from compensation to\nvacation. Corporate bylaws provided when and how board\nmeetings were to be conducted. Most issues affecting the\nshareholders were resolved by a majority vote. For example,\n\n\n1\n  Although Bluestein denies in her briefs that profits were shared equally,\na review of her citations to the record reveals that she has no evidence to\nsupport this assertion. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 requires that a\nparty genuinely disputing a fact must support that assertion by citing to\nparticular parts of the record. Celotex Corp. v.

We will not credit\nthose parts of Bluestein’s version of the facts that are not supported by any\nevidence in the record.\n\f4                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nwhen Bluestein wished to change her part-time status from\n80% to 90% in 2004, that change required approval from a\nmajority of the board. Bluestein participated in many meetings\nwhere key company issues were decided by a majority vote,\nincluding setting wage increases for non-physician staff,\nsetting anesthesia fees and policies, changing office computer\ntechnology, changing the shareholders’ deferred compensation\nand increasing paid vacation for the shareholders from ten\nweeks to twelve weeks per year.\n    In the fall of 2009, Bluestein sustained injuries in a kayak\naccident. She developed ischiogluteal bursitis, proximal\nhamstring tendinopathy, sciatica and sacral nerve root cyst.\nThese conditions made it difficult for her to complete her work\nas an anesthesiologist. Over the next several months, she\nintermittently took approved time off to rest and recover but\nshe did not heal enough to return to work at full strength. In\nAugust 2010, she sent her partners a letter setting forth her\nstatus:\n     Dear colleagues:\n     As you are probably aware, I am continuing to\n     struggle with a condition with my hamstring ten-\n     don.\n     I have just finished my recommended month off to\n     allow for healing and recovery. Unfortunately, this\n     has not led to the improvement we had hoped for. I\n     have been advised by my treating doctor that the\n     best course of action at this time would be for me to\n     take an open ended medical leave of absence in\n     order that I may continue to pursue the necessary\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                               5\n\n     treatment options without exacerbating my condi-\n     tion further. At this time, my treating doctor and I\n     share in the realization that I am unable to meet the\n     physical demands of practicing anesthesia. I truly\n     apologize for any and all inconveniences that my\n     disabled condition has caused you.\n     Thank you for your understanding and patience. I\n     hope to return to work soon.\nR. 45-33. After requesting this open-ended leave from her\nfellow physician-shareholders, the board voted to deny the\nrequest. The board then held a second vote, presenting\nshareholders with two additional options. The first would have\ngranted Bluestein a four-month leave of absence on the\ncondition that she would be terminated if she could not\nperform her duties as an anesthesiologist without restriction\nupon her return. Under the second option, Bluestein would be\nallowed to resign as of August 31, 2010, but would be termi-\nnated if her letter of resignation was not received by September\n16, 2010. Four shareholders voted in favor of the four-month\nleave and twelve chose the latter option. When Bluestein did\nnot resign by September 16, 2010, she was terminated the next\nday. Shortly thereafter, the board voted to give Bluestein her\ndeferred compensation as calculated by the firm’s deferred\ncompensation formula.\n    Bluestein sued Central Wisconsin for violations of the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the Rehabilitation\nAct and Title VII. The district court granted Central Wiscon-\nsin’s motion for summary judgment on multiple grounds.\nFirst, the court concluded that Bluestein was an employer at\n\f6                              Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nCentral Wisconsin rather than an employee, and thus was not\nentitled to the protection of the statutes at issue. Although that\nconclusion was fatal to all of Bluestein’s claims, the court also\nconsidered each discrimination claim on its merits. The court\nrejected Bluestein’s ADA claim because she had produced no\nevidence to demonstrate that she had a substantial limitation\nin any major life activity and thus was not disabled as that\nterm is defined by the statute. Moreover, she had notified her\ncolleagues that she was unable to perform the essential\nfunctions of her job and therefore was not a qualified individ-\nual with a disability unless there was a reasonable accommo-\ndation that would allow her to fulfill her job duties. The court\nfound that she failed to demonstrate that a four-month leave\nwould have enabled her to return to work and that the open-\nended leave request was unreasonable as a matter of law. The\ncourt similarly concluded that her claim of sex discrimination\nfailed because she produced no evidence that the disabled\nmale colleague to whom she compared herself was similarly\nsituated. The court summarily rejected the Rehabilitation Act\nclaim because Bluestein lacked evidence that Central Wiscon-\nsin receives federal financial assistance, a requirement for\nrecovery under that statute. In response to Central Wisconsin’s\nmotion for attorneys’ fees, the court agreed that Bluestein’s\nlawsuit was “frivolous, unreasonable and without founda-\ntion.” Bluestein v.

Acknowledging that an\naward of fees should be rare in discrimination cases, the court\nnevertheless concluded that fees were appropriate in this case\nbecause “a reasonable amount of legal research should have\nalerted counsel to the implausibility of success on any of\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                   7\n\nplaintiff’s claims of discrimination.” Id. The court found that it\nwas unreasonable for Bluestein to think that she could prevail\non “clearly frivolous claims of discrimination” because she\nshould have known she was not an “employee” of Central\nWisconsin and because she had admitted to her colleagues that\nshe could not perform the essential functions of her job. Id. The\ncourt therefore ordered Bluestein and her attorney to pay\nCentral Wisconsin’s attorneys’ fees. Bluestein and her counsel\nappeal.\n                                  II.\n    On appeal, Bluestein contends that she was an employee\nfor the purposes of the statutes at issue. She also maintains that\nshe has raised genuine issues of material fact regarding her\ndisability and sex discrimination claims. Finally, she asserts\nthat the district court abused its discretion in awarding\nattorneys’ fees to the defendant. We review the district court's\ngrant of summary judgment de novo, examining the record in\nthe light most favorable to Bluestein and construing all\nreasonable inferences from the evidence in her favor.

Each of the\nstatutes invoked by Bluestein protects employees (and others\nnot at issue here, such as job applicants) from discrimination\nby employers. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a);3 29 U.S.C. § 794(d);4\n\n\n\n\n2\n  That subsection provides, in relevant part: “In any action or proceeding\nunder this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing\nparty … a reasonable attorney's fee … as part of the costs[.]”\n\n3\n  The statute provides: “No covered entity shall discriminate against a\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application\nprocedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee\ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of\nemployment.”\n\n4\n   That section of the Rehabilitation Act directs that courts employ the\nstandards applied under the ADA to determine whether the Rehabilitation\nAct has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination.\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                                 9\n\n42 U.S.C. 2000e-2.5 But the definition of “employee” in each\nstatute is vague and circular. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (“The term\n‘employee’ means an individual employed by an employer.”);\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f) (same). See also Clackamas Gastroenterology\nAssociates, P.C. v. Wells, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127911\"><a href=\"/opinion/127911/clackamas-gastroenterology-associates-pc-v-wells/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (2003) (noting that the\ndefinition of “employee” in the ADA is circular). “Employer”\nis defined in the ADA as “a person engaged in an industry\naffecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each\nworking day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the\ncurrent or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such\nperson.” 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(A).\n    When faced with the question of determining the meaning\nof the term “employee” in the context of the ADA, the Su-\npreme Court reasoned that, when a statute does not provide a\nworking definition, the courts should turn to the common law\ntest for determining who qualifies as an employee. Clackamas,\n538 U.S. at 444-45. Clackamas presented a scenario that was\nremarkably similar to the circumstances at Central Wisconsin.\nIn that case, a bookkeeper sued a medical clinic for disability\ndiscrimination under the ADA. Because the ADA applies only\nto employers whose workforce includes fifteen or more\n\n\n5\n  The statute provides: “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\nemployer– (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or\notherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\nsuch individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (2) to limit,\nsegregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”\n\f10                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nemployees, it was necessary to determine how many “em-\nployees” the clinic employed during the relevant time period.\nThis in turn depended on whether the “four physicians\nactively engaged in medical practice as shareholders and\ndirectors of a professional corporation should be counted as\n‘employees.’” 538 U.S. at 442. The Court noted that it had\npreviously adopted the common law test to determine who\nqualifies as an employee for the purposes of the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). But the\ndefendant-clinic in Clackamas encouraged the Court to reject\nthe common law analysis in the ADA context and instead\nconclude that the shareholder-directors were more analogous\nto partners in a partnership than to shareholders in a corpora-\ntion. Partners, the clinic argued, were employers rather than\nemployees. The Court rejected the clinic’s assertion, noting that\npartnerships sometimes include hundreds of members, some\nof whom would easily qualify as employees when control is\nconcentrated in a small number of managing partners. 538 U.S.\nat 445-46.\n   Instead, the Court returned to the common law definition\nof “servant” in determining whether an individual is an\nemployee. Clackamas, 538 U.S. at 448. Under the common law\ndefinition, a servant is a person whose work is controlled or is\nsubject to a right to control by the master. Based on the\nRestatement (Second) of Agency, §§ 2(2) and 220(2)(a), the\nCourt remarked that the element of control should be the\nprincipal guidepost in assessing whether a person is an\nemployee. 538 U.S. at 448. The Court then adopted a non-\nexclusive list of six factors designed to reflect the common law\nelement of control:\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                11\n\n     Whether the organization can hire or fire the indi-\n     vidual or set the rules and regulations of the individ-\n     ual's work;\n     Whether and, if so, to what extent the organization\n     supervises the individual's work;\n     Whether the individual reports to someone higher in\n     the organization;\n     Whether and, if so, to what extent the individual is\n     able to influence the organization;\n     Whether the parties intended that the individual be\n     an employee, as expressed in written agreements or\n     contracts; and\n     Whether the individual shares in the profits, losses,\n     and liabilities of the organization.\nClackamas, 538 U.S. at 449-50. In contrast,\n     an employer is the person, or group of persons, who\n     owns and manages the enterprise. The employer can\n     hire and fire employees, can assign tasks to employ-\n     ees and supervise their performance, and can decide\n     how the profits and losses of the business are to be\n     distributed. The mere fact that a person has a partic-\n     ular title—such as partner, director, or vice\n     president—should not necessarily be used to deter-\n     mine whether he or she is an employee or a propri-\n     etor. … Nor should the mere existence of a docu-\n     ment styled “employment agreement” lead inexora-\n     bly to the conclusion that either party is an em-\n     ployee.\n\f12                              Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\n538 U.S. at 450. When deciding whether shareholder-directors\nwere employees, no one factor should be decisive, the Court\nemphasized, but all aspects of the relationship should be\nconsidered. 538 U.S. at 451. See also Smith v. Castaways Family\nDiner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794907\"><a href=\"/opinion/794907/cyndee-smith-v-castaways-family-diner-and-carrol-a-gonzalez-doing/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977 (7th Cir. 2006) (no one factor is disposi-\ntive and a court must look to all aspects of the relationship\nbetween the shareholder-director and the organization to\ndecide whether the shareholder-director exerts control or has\nthe right to exert control over the organization).\n    With those standards in mind, the question for Bluestein is\nwhether she raised a genuine issue of material fact on the issue\nof her status as an employee. As we noted above, she was a\nshareholder and member of the board of directors at Central\nWisconsin, entitled to vote on all issues coming before the\nboard and subject to the same board-and committee-approved\npolicies as every other physician-shareholder of the service\ncorporation. There were approximately sixteen physician-\nshareholders at the time of Bluestein’s termination. Turning to\nthe first part of the first factor, whether the organization can\nhire or fire the individual, the record demonstrated that hiring\nand firing decisions were made collectively by the shareholder-\nboard members. Indeed, Bluestein herself voted on her own\ntermination. Clackamas, 538 U.S. at 450 (an employer can hire\nand fire employees). That she was in the minority of that vote\ndoes not diminish her right of control on hiring and firing; the\nright to cast a vote equal to that of any other board member\nunequivocally indicates that Bluestein was an employer rather\nthan an employee for the purposes of hiring and firing.

Bluestein complains that,\nunder various policies adopted by the board and its subcom-\nmittees, she could not unilaterally take a vacation day, set her\nown schedule, assign cases to herself, or decide when she\ncould take her lunch or a break. Again, the undisputed record\ndemonstrates that it was not the “organization” but the\nphysician-shareholders who collectively voted at board\nmeetings on the rules and regulations that governed all of the\nstaff. Bluestein herself participated in board meetings and\ncommittee meetings where she voted on issues relating to\ncompensation, vacation policy and other workplace issues.\nUnlike the non-physician staff members at Central Wisconsin,\nas a full board member, Bluestein was one of the decision-\nmakers who determined the rules and regulations that gov-\nerned her own work and the work of others at the organiza-\ntion. Moreover, under the bylaws, any physician-shareholder\nwho could secure the support of a sufficient number of board\nmembers could challenge and change those policies.\n   Turning to the second factor, whether the organization\nsupervises the individual's work, Bluestein presented no\nevidence that anyone at Central Wisconsin supervised her\nwork as an anesthesiologist. Bluestein asserts as evidence of\nsupervision that she could not change her part-time work\n\f14                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nschedule from 80% to 90% without board approval. Nor could\nshe unilaterally take a leave of absence or decide upon and\nimplement her own disability accommodations. We note first\nthat these are not matters relating to the supervision of her\nwork as an anesthesiologist but are more in the nature of the\ngeneral office rules and policies that we addressed in the first\nfactor. The salient point is that Bluestein could point to no\nsupervisor at Central Wisconsin who dictated how Bluestein\npracticed anesthesiology. As a physician, she determined how\nto complete the specific tasks of her work. Bluestein has\nproduced no evidence that anyone at Central Wisconsin had a\nright to control the details of her work. See Clackamas, 538 U.S.\nat 448 (in distinguishing between servants and independent\ncontractors, the extent of control one may exercise over the\ndetails of the work of the other is a primary consideration);\nSchmidt, 322 F.3d at 467 (where service corporation’s board\nassigns patients to physicians, and physician then has absolute\nauthority for the treatment of those patients, the physician is an\nemployer rather than an employee, especially where the\nphysician exercises as much control over his employment as\nany other member of the physician-shareholder board).\nBluestein thus fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact on\nthe question of supervision.\n   Bluestein treats the third factor—whether the individual\nreports to someone higher in the organization—as essentially\nco-extensive with the test for supervision. She asserts that one\nphysician, Dr. Mason, was the chair of the board for eleven\nyears, that he intimidated and discouraged others from\nrunning for the post of chair, and that he failed to follow the\nbylaws requirement of holding an election every two years.\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                               15\n\nBluestein claims that she was required to seek approval from\nMason or another physician for days off, and that a committee\nof which she was not a member determined doctors’ schedules\nand patient assignments. But all of this was the result of the\ncollective action (or inaction) of Bluestein’s fellow physician-\nshareholders. That Bluestein was in a minority position on how\nthe service corporation organized schedules, patient assign-\nments and time off is irrelevant to her right to an equal vote on\nthese issues as a shareholder. None of this evidence addresses\nwhether she “reported to” someone higher in the organization.\nInstead, the evidence demonstrates that each physician-\nshareholder had an equal vote in matters affecting the organi-\nzation. That some functions or control may have been dele-\ngated to the board chair is irrelevant because Bluestein had an\nequal vote in the delegation. Nor does it matter for the pur-\nposes of determining her status as an employee that Dr. Mason\nappeared to have great influence with his colleagues. Under\nthe bylaws, the shareholders were free to delegate authority to\none of their members and just as free to retract that delegation.\nBut each shareholder, including Bluestein, had an equal vote.\nOnce again, that she was in the minority view does not detract\nfrom her right of control.\n    The fourth factor is whether and to what extent an individ-\nual is able to influence the organization. Bluestein asserts that\nshe had no authority, control or influence over the board. But\nshe bases this assertion on the same evidence that we found\ninadequate above. She does not dispute on appeal that she was\na full member of the board and an equal shareholder entitled\nto vote on all matters coming before the board. Instead, she\nessentially alleges that she frequently found herself in the\n\f16                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nminority position on how her colleagues decided to run the\nbusiness. Not winning the vote is not the same as not having\na vote, however, and it is her opportunity for shared control\nthat counts when determining whether she was an employer\nor employee. See Schmidt, 322 F.3d at 468 (“when an individual\nclaimant-shareholder enjoys the opportunity for shared control\nof the closely held professional corporation, including the\nopportunity to share in its profits, we will treat him or her as\na bona fide employer for purposes of the ADEA.”).\n    As the district court noted, Bluestein’s situation was\nmarkedly different from that of the thirty-two partners\ndemoted from full partnership in EEOC v. Sidley Austin Brown\n& Wood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780395\"><a href=\"/opinion/780395/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-applicant-appellee-v-sidley/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2002). In that case, a large law\nfirm consisting of more than 500 partners demoted thirty-two\npartners who then sued the firm under the Age Discrimination\nin Employment Act. Unlike Central Wisconsin, the law firm\nwas controlled by a small, self-perpetuating executive commit-\ntee that held the power to hire, fire, promote and determine the\ncompensation of the partners who were not on the committee.\nAlthough all partners shared the firm’s liabilities in proportion\nto their share of capital in the firm, profits were distributed\naccording to a formula determined by the executive committee.\nAll of the firm’s committees were subject to the control of the\nexecutive committee, which appointed all of the members of\nother committees. The partners did not elect the members of\nthe executive committee; instead, the executive committee\ndetermined its own membership. The thirty-two demoted\npartners thus had no voting power and no control over their\nfate at the firm. The only issue on which the entire partnership\nvoted related to a merger with another firm. Otherwise, the\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                             17\n\nexecutive committee controlled the running of the firm. We\nheld that not all partners should be deemed employers as a\nmatter of law. 315 F.3d at 702. Rather, some shareholders of a\nprofessional corporation may be considered employees for the\npurposes of federal anti-discrimination law. 315 F.3d at 703.\nThe manner of sharing profits and liabilities, the partners’\nability to control their own fates, and the amount of control\npartners had to conduct their own work all contributed to the\nanalysis of whether these thirty-two partners were employers\nor employees. We remanded to the district court to allow for\ndiscovery on those issues.\n    In contrast, Central Wisconsin was run by a sixteen-\nmember board that consisted of all of the physician-sharehold-\ners, not some exclusive subset of them. All major decisions\nwere put to a vote and each shareholder had an equal vote.\nBoth profits and losses were shared equally. Bluestein enjoyed\nthe same right of control that every other physician-share-\nholder possessed. She possessed no more or less of a right to\ninfluence the organization than any other partner.\n   Turning to the fifth factor—whether the parties intended\nthe individual to be an employee, as expressed in written\nagreements or contracts—we will assume that the contract\nBluestein signed before she became a full shareholder was still\nin effect at the time of her termination from the service\ncorporation. That contract referred to Bluestein as an em-\nployee. Bluestein also notes that she received a W-2 form\nindicating her wages annually. But the Clackamas Court\ncautioned that “the mere existence of a document styled\n‘employment agreement’ [should not] lead inexorably to the\nconclusion that either party is an employee.” Clackamas, 538\n\f18                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\nU.S. at 450-51. And we found that the physician-shareholder in\nSchmidt was an employer even though he had an employment\nagreement with the professional corporation that described\nhim repeatedly as an employee and even though he received\na base salary reported on a W-2. Schmidt was an employer, we\nfound, because he shared in the management and control of\nthe professional corporation throughout his career, and was a\nshareholder, a corporate officer, a board member and a director\nthroughout his tenure. As a shareholder, he possessed an equal\nvote in all matters put to a shareholder vote and had a voice in\nall matters put before the board. 322 F.3d at 467. Like Bluestein,\nhe frequently found himself in the minority position on the\nvotes of his fellow shareholders but that did not alter the fact\nthat he had the right to exercise control with each vote and had\nan opportunity to participate in revising and voting on board\nplans with which he disagreed. Id. Like Bluestein, Schmidt did\nnot possess sole authority over the conditions of his employ-\nment but rather shared that authority in equal parts with other\nmembers of the board. Like Bluestein, Schmidt exercised as\nmuch control over his employment as any other shareholder.\n322 F.3d at 467. These factors, considered as a whole, overcame\nthe simple labeling of Schmidt as an employee in the employ-\nment agreement. 322 F.3d at 468 (“when an individual claim-\nant-shareholder enjoys the opportunity for shared control of\nthe closely held professional corporation, including the\nopportunity to share in its profits, we will treat him or her as\na bona fide employer for purposes of the ADEA”). Under our\nreasoning in Schmidt, the language in Bluestein’s contract\ncannot overcome the reality of her position in the professional\ncorporation.\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                  19\n\n    Finally, Bluestein failed to raise a genuine issue of material\nfact on the sixth factor, whether an individual shares in the\nprofits, losses and liabilities of the organization. In addressing\nthe sixth factor, Bluestein baldly asserts in her brief that she did\nnot share equally in the profits and losses of Central Wisconsin.\nBut a review of her citations to the record reveals no evidence\nin support of that assertion. She therefore raises no genuine\nissue of material fact on the sixth factor. See supra note 1.\n    Taking all six factors as a whole, we conclude that Bluestein\nwas an employer as a matter of law. In sum, she was a full\nphysician-shareholder and board member in a small medical\nprofessional corporation. She had an equal right to vote on all\nmatters coming before the board, shared equally in the firm’s\nprofits and liabilities, and participated in decisions to hire and\nfire employees. She even voted on her own termination.\nAlthough she was subject to general workplace policies\nregarding her hours, vacation, scheduling and patient assign-\nments, all the physician-shareholders were subject to the same\npolicies, and all had an equal right to influence those policies.\nShe reported to no one and the details of her work as an\nanesthesiologist were not supervised or controlled by anyone\nat the firm. Although she often found herself in the minority\nposition among her fellow physician-shareholders, it is her\nright of control that matters to the analysis. Our conclusion that\nshe was an employer is fatal to all of her discrimination claims.\nWe therefore need not consider the merits of the individual\ndiscrimination claims and we affirm summary judgment in\nfavor of Central Wisconsin.\n\f20                             Nos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257\n\n                                 B.\n    Bluestein and her lawyer also appeal the district court’s\naward of attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), a\ndetermination that we review for abuse of discretion.\nChristiansburg Garment, 434 U.S. at 421; Munson, 969 F.2d at\n269. “[A] district court may in its discretion award attorney's\nfees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon a finding\nthat the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or\nwithout foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad\nfaith.” Christiansburg Garment, 434 U.S. at 421.\n    In analyzing the request for fees, the district court re-\ncounted its conclusions on summary judgment: (1) that the\nundisputed facts demonstrated that Bluestein was an employer\nrather than an employee; (2) that she failed to produce any\nevidence that Central Wisconsin received financial assistance\nfrom the federal government, a requirement for suits under the\nRehabilitation Act; (3) that she did not demonstrate that she\nwas disabled within the meaning of the ADA because she\nproduced no evidence of a substantial limitation in a major life\nactivity; (4) that she did not show what reasonable accommo-\ndation the defendant could have provided her; (5) that she did\nnot demonstrate that she was a “qualified individual” under\nthe ADA and instead failed to acknowledge her admission to\nher fellow shareholders that she was unable to meet the\nphysical demands of practicing anesthesia; (6) that she did not\nestablish that the extended or indefinite leave of absence she\nrequested was a reasonable accommodation in light of circuit\nlaw to the contrary; and (7) that she did not raise a genuine\nissue of material fact on her claim of sex discrimination. The\ncourt also noted that a reasonable amount of legal research\n\fNos. 13-3724, 14-1256 & 14-1257                                21\n\nshould have alerted counsel to the implausibility of success on\nthe merits of any of her claims. The combination of these\nfactors led the court to conclude that Bluestein’s suit was\nfrivolous, unreasonable and without foundation, and that an\naward of fees was appropriate in this instance.\n     Bluestein cites “two glaring features” of the district court\nrecord that she contends require reversal of the award of fees.\nFirst, the district court denied Central Wisconsin’s motion to\ndismiss the case, and second, neither the court nor the defen-\ndant ever hinted prior to summary judgment that they consid-\nered the case frivolous. The motion to dismiss, however, was\nbased not on the merits of the suit but on the plaintiff’s failure\nto cooperate with discovery. The court denied that motion\nbecause it concluded that lesser sanctions would be adequate\nto remedy the plaintiff’s discovery violations. There was no\nreason for the court to address the merits of the suit at that\ntime. And Bluestein does not explain why it was improper for\nthe defendant to await the factual development of the case and\nsummary judgment before seeking fees. In any case, the\ndefendant alerted the plaintiff that it considered the suit\nfrivolous when it filed its answer to the complaint early in the\nlitigation. “Abuse of discretion exists only where the result is\nnot one that could have been reached by a reasonable jurist or\nwhere the decision of the trial court strikes us as fundamen-\ntally wrong or is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful.”\nGreviskes v.
