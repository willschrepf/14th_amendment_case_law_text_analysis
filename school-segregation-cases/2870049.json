Civil No. 00-cv-00045)\n                         District Judge: Jerome B. Simandle\n\n\n                      Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                                 November 18, 2003\n\n             Before: RENDELL, BARRY and CHERTOFF, Circuit Judges.\n\n                               (Filed December 22, 2003)\n\n\n                              OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge.\n\n      Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”) permits the government\n\nto collect from a “responsible” person who willfully fails to pay employment taxes an\n\namount equal to the unpaid taxes. 26 U.S.C. § 6672. The United States assessed\n\fLawrence A. Mitchell under this provision for the unpaid employment taxes of Mitchell\n\nConstruction, Inc. (“Mitchell Construction” or “the corporation”) for the fourth quarter of\n\n1986 and the first, second and third quarters of 1987. It filed this action under 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 7401 to reduce that assessment to judgment. The District Court entered judgment for\n\nthe United States after a bench trial, finding Mitchell liable for the assessment of unpaid\n\ntaxes in the amount of $463,168.83, plus applicable interest and penalties since December\n\n13, 1999. Mitchell now appeals. For the reasons which follow, we will affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       From 1972 to 1998, Mitchell was employed in electrical and mechanical\n\ncontracting, doing business under the name of Mitchell Mechanical/Electrical\n\nContractors, Inc. In 1986, Mitchell agreed to “lend” his name and his licenses to a new\n\ncorporation, Mitchell Construction, that was to be an electrical contractor on a\n\ncondominium project in Brigantine, New Jersey. Mitchell was president of the\n\ncorporation, its highest ranking officer, and a member of the Board of Directors. He also\n\nhad substantial authority directing the construction work at the project.\n\n       Mitchell had signature authority on the corporate accounts at First Jersey National\n\nBank, including the general operating account, the petty cash account and the payroll\n\naccount. He signed payroll checks from the payroll from the fourth quarter of 1986\n\nthrough the fourth quarter of 1987. Mitchell Construction filed Form 941, Employer’s\n\nQuarterly Federal Tax Return, for the fourth quarter of 1986 and the first three quarters of\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f1987, but failed to pay over the income and social security taxes it withheld from\n\nemployees’ wages for those quarters.\n\n       In January 1990, pursuant to § 6672, the IRS assessed Mitchell for $196,428 as a\n\nresponsible person of Mitchell Construction who willfully failed to pay over trust fund\n\ntaxes for the fourth quarter of 1986 and the first three quarters of 1987. On January 5,\n\n2000, the United States filed its complaint in this case, seeking to reduce the assessment,\n\nplus interest and statutory additions, to judgment.\n\n       On the day of trial, Mitchell’s attorney, Gary Levin, orally amended M itchell’s\n\npending motion to dismiss, contending for the first time that the handwritten date in the\n\n“Assessment Date” box of Mitchell’s copy of IRS Form 2749, Request for 100-Percent\n\nPenalty Assessment, indicated that Mitchell’s assessment date was January 4, 1990, rather\n\nthan January 9, 1990, as the government’s copy of Form 2749 indicated. He further\n\nargued that the appearance of “January 9, 1990” on all subsequent IRS documents,\n\nincluding the official Form 4340, Certificate of Assessments and Payments, was the result\n\nof a typographical error when the information from Form 2749 had been transcribed. As\n\na result, Levin argued that the complaint was time-barred, because it had been filed on\n\nJanuary 5, 2000, more than ten years after the assessment date. 26 U.S.C. § 6502(a).\n\n       Levin asked that the government be required to produce the original Form 2749.\n\nGiven that it had not been listed as an exhibit in the joint final pre-trial order and that it\n\nmight take more than two weeks to obtain the original document from the IRS, the\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fDistrict Court allowed the government to submit a copy from its file. After examining\n\nMitchell’s copy of Form 2749, the government’s copy of Form 2749 and enlargements of\n\nboth copies, and hearing testimony from an IRS employee about IRS procedures, the\n\nDistrict Court concluded that Mitchell’s copy had been altered to turn “January 9, 1990”\n\ninto “January 4, 1990.” In its view, the preponderance of the evidence, including Form\n\n4340 and the Individual Master File Account Transcript, indicated that the penalty had\n\nbeen assessed on January 9, 1990. The District Court concluded that the government’s\n\nclaim was not time-barred and denied Mitchell’s motion to dismiss.\n\n       The case proceeded to trial. After the government had presented its case, M itchell\n\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing that the government had not proven a “nexus”\n\nbetween the corporation’s earnings and a trust fund for withheld taxes, nor had it\n\npresented sufficient evidence to find Mitchell a “responsible” person under § 6672. The\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion, finding that Mitchell’s “nexus” argument was incorrect\n\nas a matter of law and that, based on tax returns and corporate checks signed by Mitchell\n\nduring the relevant time period, there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward.\n\n       In his defense, Mitchell testified that he had resigned as president on December 16,\n\n1986, and had no knowledge of the corporation’s activities after that date. He further\n\ntestified that his name had been forged on corporate checks. However, based on the\n\ntestimony of other corporate officers and an examination of the many documents\n\ninvolved, the District Court concluded that these assertions “were untrue.” It found that\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fMitchell was “responsible” and “willful” within the meaning of § 6672 and entered\n\njudgment against him.\n\n         Mitchell challenges the District Court’s decision not to require the government to\n\nproduce the original Form 2749. He also asserts that the District Court erred in finding\n\nthat § 6672 does not require a nexus between corporate receipts and taxes held in trust\n\nand in finding him a responsible person under § 6672. We have jurisdiction under 28 §\n\nU.S.C. 1291.\n\n                                               II.\n\n         First, Mitchell contends that the District Court erred in not requiring the\n\ngovernment to produce the original Form 2749, despite the fact that it had not been listed\n\non the final pretrial order. We review a district court’s ruling as to the admissibility of\n\nevidence for an abuse of discretion. SEC v. Infinity Group Co., 212 F.3d 180, 198 (3d\n\nCir. 2000). Likewise, “departure from or adherence to the final pretrial order is a matter\n\npeculiarly within the province of the trial judge, whose decision will not be disturbed on\n\nappeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Berroyer v. Hertz, 672 F.2d 334 (3d. Cir.\n\n1982).\n\n         Fed. R. Evid. 1002 provides that, to prove the contents of a writing, the original\n\nwriting is required, except as otherwise provided by the Rules. One such exception, Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 1003, provides that a duplicate is admissible unless (1) a genuine question is\n\nraised as to the authenticity of the original, or (2) in the circumstances, it would be unfair\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fto admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. In light of the copy of Form 2749 that\n\nMitchell proffered on the morning of the trial, he argues that there is a genuine question\n\nas to the authenticity of the original Form 2749, and that the government should have\n\nbeen required to produce it.\n\n       The District Court ultimately concluded that Mitchell’s copy had been altered in\n\nsome fashion. Considering the questionable nature of the evidence offered by Mitchell,\n\nwe cannot say that he has raised a “genuine” question as to the authenticity of the original\n\nForm 2749. As a result, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\ngovernment’s copy. 1 Furthermore, the District Court’s decision was even more\n\nappropriate in light of the fact that Form 2749 was not listed in the final pretrial order.\n\nThus, we are convinced that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       Second, Mitchell argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the\n\ngovernment was not required to prove a nexus between corporate earnings and taxes held\n\nin trust before liability could be imposed upon him under § 6672. Our review of\n\nquestions of law is plenary. Edwards v. Wyatt, 335 F.3d 261, 271 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n       Mitchell claims that Mitchell Construction received no payments from its\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        We note that the District Court also admitted into evidence the copy of Form 2749\noffered by Mitchell, and weighed the significance of both copies, as well as other\ndocumentary evidence, including the official Certificate of Assessments and Payments,\nbefore concluding that Mitchell’s assessment date was January 9, 1990.\n\n                                               6\n\femployer during the relevant time period, and therefore, that Mitchell Construction had\n\nno money with which to pay employment taxes and could not place funds in trust for the\n\npayment of these taxes.2 As a result, he argues that the corporation had no obligation to\n\npay taxes and that he cannot be held personally liable for its failure to do so.\n\n       However, Sections 3102(a) and 3402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code require\n\nemployers to deduct and withhold payroll taxes as wages are paid. Slodov v. United\n\nStates, 436 U.S. 238, 243 (1978). Under § 7501(a), the withheld taxes are “held to be a\n\nspecial fund in trust for the United States.” Slodov, 436 U.S. at 244. See also United\n\nStates v. Bisbee, 245 F.3d 1001, 1005 (8th Cir. 2001) (“Every employer is required to\n\ndeduct and withhold federal income tax and Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA)\n\ntax from employees’ wages as and when they are paid, ... and to hold the amounts\n\nwithheld in trust for the United States”). Thus, Mitchell Construction became liable for\n\npayroll taxes the moment that it paid wages to its employees, regardless of whether or not\n\nit received payment from its employer and regardless of whether or not it placed the\n\nwithheld funds in a segregated account. Accordingly, we reject Mitchell’s argument.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       Third, Mitchell argues that the District Court erred in concluding that Mitchell was\n\na responsible person within the ambit of § 6672. We review the District Court’s findings\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       We note that contrary to this claim the District Court concluded that Mitchell\nConstruction did have sufficient deposits in its bank accounts to cover its tax obligation.\n\n                                              7\n\fof fact for clear error. Edwards, 335 F.3d at 271.\n\n       Section 6672(a) of the Code provides that “any person required to collect,\n\ntruthfully account for, and pay over any tax .... who willfully fails to collect such tax, or\n\ntruthfully account for and pay over such tax .... shall .... be liable to a penalty equal to the\n\ntotal amount of the tax.” Section 6671(b) defines “person,” for purposes of § 6672, as\n\nincluding “an officer or an employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a\n\npartnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act\n\nin respect of which the violation occurs.” As a result, an individual responsible for the\n\ncollection and payment of a corporation’s trust fund taxes who willfully fails to do so is\n\npersonally liable for the amount of the unpaid taxes. Slodov, 436 U.S. at 245.\n\n       Two conditions must be satisfied before liability can attach under § 6672: (1) the\n\nindividual must be a “responsible person,” and (2) his or her failure to pay the tax must be\n\n“willful.” Greenberg v. United States, 46 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir. 1994). “Responsibility\n\nis a matter of status, duty or authority, not knowledge.” Quattrone Accountants, Inc. v.\n\nIRS, 895 F.2d 921, 927 (3d Cir. 1990). Courts consider several factors in determining\n\nwhether an individual is “responsible” for collecting and paying a corporation’s taxes,\n\nincluding: (1) the contents of the corporate bylaws; (2) the ability to sign checks on the\n\ncompany’s bank account; (3) the signature on the corporation’s tax returns; (4) the\n\npayment of other creditors; (5) the identity of officers, directors and principal\n\nstockholders in the corporation; (6) the identity of individuals in charge of hiring and\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fdischarging employees; and (7) the identity of individuals in charge of the firm’s financial\n\naffairs. Brounstein v. United States, 979 F.2d 952, 954-55 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\n       Mitchell was president of Mitchell Construction, served on its Board of Directors,\n\nand had signature authority over its various bank accounts, all of which would indicate\n\nthat he was a “responsible person” under § 6672. Nevertheless, he argues that he\n\nresigned from the corporation on December 16, 1986, and that, while he remained with\n\ncompany after that date, no longer had the type of authority over corporate affairs to be\n\ndeemed “responsible” during the relevant time period. However, this claim is\n\ncontradicted by the testimony of Thomas Pauley, chairman of the corporation’s Board of\n\nDirectors, that he had no recollection of a letter of resignation and that Mitchell remained\n\ninvolved in the management of the corporation after that date. Mitchell’s own testimony\n\nindicated a level of familiarity with the corporation’s financial affairs after his\n\n“resignation” that could have only come from his continued involvement in the\n\ncorporation’s most important decisions. In addition, despite M itchell’s contention that his\n\nname was forged on corporate documents after his “resignation,” the District Court\n\ndetermined that his signature appeared on corporate checks totaling hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars and corporate tax returns, both before and after December 16, 1986.\n\nLooking at the facts and the aforementioned factors, Mitchell’s position within the\n\ncorporation, the presence of his signature on corporate checks and tax returns, and his\n\nauthority over the firm’s financial affairs clearly indicate that he was a “responsible\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fperson” within the meaning of the statute.\n\n       Turning to the second condition, “in order for the failure to turn over withholding\n\ntaxes to be willful, a responsible person need only know that the taxes are due or act in\n\nreckless disregard of this fact when he fails to remit to the IRS.” Greenberg, 46 F.3d at\n\n244. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that he was well aware of the tax obligation of the\n\ncorporation, and yet he took no steps to pay it. As a result, his failure to turn over the\n\ncorporation’s withholding taxes could be considered willful within the meaning of the\n\nstatute.\n\n       Thus, based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot err in finding that Mitchell (1) was a responsible person, and (2) willfully failed to pay\n\nover federal employment taxes.\n\n                                              V.\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fTO THE CLERK OF COURT:\n\n      Please file the foregoing opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                /s/ Marjorie O.

Simandle\n\n\n                      Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                                 November 18, 2003\n\n             Before: RENDELL, BARRY and CHERTOFF, Circuit Judges.\n\n                               (Filed December 22, 2003)\n\n\n                              OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge.\n\n      Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”) permits the government\n\nto collect from a “responsible” person who willfully fails to pay employment taxes an\n\namount equal to the unpaid taxes. 26 U.S.C. § 6672. The United States assessed\n\fLawrence A. Mitchell under this provision for the unpaid employment taxes of Mitchell\n\nConstruction, Inc. (“Mitchell Construction” or “the corporation”) for the fourth quarter of\n\n1986 and the first, second and third quarters of 1987. It filed this action under 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 7401 to reduce that assessment to judgment. The District Court entered judgment for\n\nthe United States after a bench trial, finding Mitchell liable for the assessment of unpaid\n\ntaxes in the amount of $463,168.83, plus applicable interest and penalties since December\n\n13, 1999. Mitchell now appeals. For the reasons which follow, we will affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       From 1972 to 1998, Mitchell was employed in electrical and mechanical\n\ncontracting, doing business under the name of Mitchell Mechanical/Electrical\n\nContractors, Inc. In 1986, Mitchell agreed to “lend” his name and his licenses to a new\n\ncorporation, Mitchell Construction, that was to be an electrical contractor on a\n\ncondominium project in Brigantine, New Jersey. Mitchell was president of the\n\ncorporation, its highest ranking officer, and a member of the Board of Directors. He also\n\nhad substantial authority directing the construction work at the project.\n\n       Mitchell had signature authority on the corporate accounts at First Jersey National\n\nBank, including the general operating account, the petty cash account and the payroll\n\naccount. He signed payroll checks from the payroll from the fourth quarter of 1986\n\nthrough the fourth quarter of 1987. Mitchell Construction filed Form 941, Employer’s\n\nQuarterly Federal Tax Return, for the fourth quarter of 1986 and the first three quarters of\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f1987, but failed to pay over the income and social security taxes it withheld from\n\nemployees’ wages for those quarters.\n\n       In January 1990, pursuant to § 6672, the IRS assessed Mitchell for $196,428 as a\n\nresponsible person of Mitchell Construction who willfully failed to pay over trust fund\n\ntaxes for the fourth quarter of 1986 and the first three quarters of 1987. On January 5,\n\n2000, the United States filed its complaint in this case, seeking to reduce the assessment,\n\nplus interest and statutory additions, to judgment.\n\n       On the day of trial, Mitchell’s attorney, Gary Levin, orally amended M itchell’s\n\npending motion to dismiss, contending for the first time that the handwritten date in the\n\n“Assessment Date” box of Mitchell’s copy of IRS Form 2749, Request for 100-Percent\n\nPenalty Assessment, indicated that Mitchell’s assessment date was January 4, 1990, rather\n\nthan January 9, 1990, as the government’s copy of Form 2749 indicated. He further\n\nargued that the appearance of “January 9, 1990” on all subsequent IRS documents,\n\nincluding the official Form 4340, Certificate of Assessments and Payments, was the result\n\nof a typographical error when the information from Form 2749 had been transcribed. As\n\na result, Levin argued that the complaint was time-barred, because it had been filed on\n\nJanuary 5, 2000, more than ten years after the assessment date. 26 U.S.C. § 6502(a).\n\n       Levin asked that the government be required to produce the original Form 2749.\n\nGiven that it had not been listed as an exhibit in the joint final pre-trial order and that it\n\nmight take more than two weeks to obtain the original document from the IRS, the\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fDistrict Court allowed the government to submit a copy from its file. After examining\n\nMitchell’s copy of Form 2749, the government’s copy of Form 2749 and enlargements of\n\nboth copies, and hearing testimony from an IRS employee about IRS procedures, the\n\nDistrict Court concluded that Mitchell’s copy had been altered to turn “January 9, 1990”\n\ninto “January 4, 1990.” In its view, the preponderance of the evidence, including Form\n\n4340 and the Individual Master File Account Transcript, indicated that the penalty had\n\nbeen assessed on January 9, 1990. The District Court concluded that the government’s\n\nclaim was not time-barred and denied Mitchell’s motion to dismiss.\n\n       The case proceeded to trial. After the government had presented its case, M itchell\n\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing that the government had not proven a “nexus”\n\nbetween the corporation’s earnings and a trust fund for withheld taxes, nor had it\n\npresented sufficient evidence to find Mitchell a “responsible” person under § 6672. The\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion, finding that Mitchell’s “nexus” argument was incorrect\n\nas a matter of law and that, based on tax returns and corporate checks signed by Mitchell\n\nduring the relevant time period, there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward.\n\n       In his defense, Mitchell testified that he had resigned as president on December 16,\n\n1986, and had no knowledge of the corporation’s activities after that date. He further\n\ntestified that his name had been forged on corporate checks. However, based on the\n\ntestimony of other corporate officers and an examination of the many documents\n\ninvolved, the District Court concluded that these assertions “were untrue.” It found that\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fMitchell was “responsible” and “willful” within the meaning of § 6672 and entered\n\njudgment against him.\n\n         Mitchell challenges the District Court’s decision not to require the government to\n\nproduce the original Form 2749. He also asserts that the District Court erred in finding\n\nthat § 6672 does not require a nexus between corporate receipts and taxes held in trust\n\nand in finding him a responsible person under § 6672. We have jurisdiction under 28 §\n\nU.S.C. 1291.\n\n                                               II.\n\n         First, Mitchell contends that the District Court erred in not requiring the\n\ngovernment to produce the original Form 2749, despite the fact that it had not been listed\n\non the final pretrial order. We review a district court’s ruling as to the admissibility of\n\nevidence for an abuse of discretion. SEC v. Infinity Group Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768676\"><a href=\"/opinion/768676/sec-v-the-infinity-group-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (3d\n\nCir. 2000). Likewise, “departure from or adherence to the final pretrial order is a matter\n\npeculiarly within the province of the trial judge, whose decision will not be disturbed on\n\nappeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Berroyer v. Hertz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"400094\"><a href=\"/opinion/400094/patricia-berroyer-v-sidney-s-hertz/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d. Cir.\n\n1982).\n\n         Fed. R. Evid. 1002 provides that, to prove the contents of a writing, the original\n\nwriting is required, except as otherwise provided by the Rules. One such exception, Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 1003, provides that a duplicate is admissible unless (1) a genuine question is\n\nraised as to the authenticity of the original, or (2) in the circumstances, it would be unfair\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fto admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. In light of the copy of Form 2749 that\n\nMitchell proffered on the morning of the trial, he argues that there is a genuine question\n\nas to the authenticity of the original Form 2749, and that the government should have\n\nbeen required to produce it.\n\n       The District Court ultimately concluded that Mitchell’s copy had been altered in\n\nsome fashion. Considering the questionable nature of the evidence offered by Mitchell,\n\nwe cannot say that he has raised a “genuine” question as to the authenticity of the original\n\nForm 2749. As a result, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\ngovernment’s copy. 1 Furthermore, the District Court’s decision was even more\n\nappropriate in light of the fact that Form 2749 was not listed in the final pretrial order.\n\nThus, we are convinced that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       Second, Mitchell argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the\n\ngovernment was not required to prove a nexus between corporate earnings and taxes held\n\nin trust before liability could be imposed upon him under § 6672. Our review of\n\nquestions of law is plenary. Edwards v. Wyatt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782617\"><a href=\"/opinion/782617/john-joseph-edwards-v-a-wesley-wyatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 271 (3d Cir. 2003).\n\n       Mitchell claims that Mitchell Construction received no payments from its\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        We note that the District Court also admitted into evidence the copy of Form 2749\noffered by Mitchell, and weighed the significance of both copies, as well as other\ndocumentary evidence, including the official Certificate of Assessments and Payments,\nbefore concluding that Mitchell’s assessment date was January 9, 1990.\n\n                                               6\n\femployer during the relevant time period, and therefore, that Mitchell Construction had\n\nno money with which to pay employment taxes and could not place funds in trust for the\n\npayment of these taxes.2 As a result, he argues that the corporation had no obligation to\n\npay taxes and that he cannot be held personally liable for its failure to do so.\n\n       However, Sections 3102(a) and 3402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code require\n\nemployers to deduct and withhold payroll taxes as wages are paid. Slodov v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109863\"><a href=\"/opinion/109863/slodov-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (1978). Under § 7501(a), the withheld taxes are “held to be a\n\nspecial fund in trust for the United States.” Slodov, 436 U.S. at 244. See also United\n\nStates v. Bisbee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772750\"><a href=\"/opinion/772750/united-states-v-jean-e-bisbee-maurice-warner-green-jr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1005 (8th Cir. 2001) (“Every employer is required to\n\ndeduct and withhold federal income tax and Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA)\n\ntax from employees’ wages as and when they are paid, ... and to hold the amounts\n\nwithheld in trust for the United States”). Thus, Mitchell Construction became liable for\n\npayroll taxes the moment that it paid wages to its employees, regardless of whether or not\n\nit received payment from its employer and regardless of whether or not it placed the\n\nwithheld funds in a segregated account. Accordingly, we reject Mitchell’s argument.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       Third, Mitchell argues that the District Court erred in concluding that Mitchell was\n\na responsible person within the ambit of § 6672. We review the District Court’s findings\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       We note that contrary to this claim the District Court concluded that Mitchell\nConstruction did have sufficient deposits in its bank accounts to cover its tax obligation.\n\n                                              7\n\fof fact for clear error. Edwards, 335 F.3d at 271.\n\n       Section 6672(a) of the Code provides that “any person required to collect,\n\ntruthfully account for, and pay over any tax .... who willfully fails to collect such tax, or\n\ntruthfully account for and pay over such tax .... shall .... be liable to a penalty equal to the\n\ntotal amount of the tax.” Section 6671(b) defines “person,” for purposes of § 6672, as\n\nincluding “an officer or an employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a\n\npartnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act\n\nin respect of which the violation occurs.” As a result, an individual responsible for the\n\ncollection and payment of a corporation’s trust fund taxes who willfully fails to do so is\n\npersonally liable for the amount of the unpaid taxes. Slodov, 436 U.S. at 245.\n\n       Two conditions must be satisfied before liability can attach under § 6672: (1) the\n\nindividual must be a “responsible person,” and (2) his or her failure to pay the tax must be\n\n“willful.” Greenberg v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687600\"><a href=\"/opinion/687600/mark-z-greenberg-v-united-states-of-america-department-of-the-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (3d Cir. 1994). “Responsibility\n\nis a matter of status, duty or authority, not knowledge.” Quattrone Accountants, Inc. v.\n\nIRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536182\"><a href=\"/opinion/536182/quattrone-accountants-inc-and-philip-p-quattrone-v-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927 (3d Cir. 1990). Courts consider several factors in determining\n\nwhether an individual is “responsible” for collecting and paying a corporation’s taxes,\n\nincluding: (1) the contents of the corporate bylaws; (2) the ability to sign checks on the\n\ncompany’s bank account; (3) the signature on the corporation’s tax returns; (4) the\n\npayment of other creditors; (5) the identity of officers, directors and principal\n\nstockholders in the corporation; (6) the identity of individuals in charge of hiring and\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fdischarging employees; and (7) the identity of individuals in charge of the firm’s financial\n\naffairs. Brounstein v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595192\"><a href=\"/opinion/595192/lou-brounstein-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954-55 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\n       Mitchell was president of Mitchell Construction, served on its Board of Directors,\n\nand had signature authority over its various bank accounts, all of which would indicate\n\nthat he was a “responsible person” under § 6672. Nevertheless, he argues that he\n\nresigned from the corporation on December 16, 1986, and that, while he remained with\n\ncompany after that date, no longer had the type of authority over corporate affairs to be\n\ndeemed “responsible” during the relevant time period. However, this claim is\n\ncontradicted by the testimony of Thomas Pauley, chairman of the corporation’s Board of\n\nDirectors, that he had no recollection of a letter of resignation and that Mitchell remained\n\ninvolved in the management of the corporation after that date. Mitchell’s own testimony\n\nindicated a level of familiarity with the corporation’s financial affairs after his\n\n“resignation” that could have only come from his continued involvement in the\n\ncorporation’s most important decisions. In addition, despite M itchell’s contention that his\n\nname was forged on corporate documents after his “resignation,” the District Court\n\ndetermined that his signature appeared on corporate checks totaling hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars and corporate tax returns, both before and after December 16, 1986.\n\nLooking at the facts and the aforementioned factors, Mitchell’s position within the\n\ncorporation, the presence of his signature on corporate checks and tax returns, and his\n\nauthority over the firm’s financial affairs clearly indicate that he was a “responsible\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fperson” within the meaning of the statute.\n\n       Turning to the second condition, “in order for the failure to turn over withholding\n\ntaxes to be willful, a responsible person need only know that the taxes are due or act in\n\nreckless disregard of this fact when he fails to remit to the IRS.” Greenberg, 46 F.3d at\n\n244. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that he was well aware of the tax obligation of the\n\ncorporation, and yet he took no steps to pay it. As a result, his failure to turn over the\n\ncorporation’s withholding taxes could be considered willful within the meaning of the\n\nstatute.\n\n       Thus, based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the District Court did\n\nnot err in finding that Mitchell (1) was a responsible person, and (2) willfully failed to pay\n\nover federal employment taxes.\n\n                                              V.\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fTO THE CLERK OF COURT:\n\n      Please file the foregoing opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                /s/ Marjorie O.
