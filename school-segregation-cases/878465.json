Hall appeals the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment to the City of Los Angeles and individual\ndefendants Mark Arneson and Kenneth Crocker (collectively,\n“Appellees”) in this action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. We conclude that the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment to Appellees on Hall’s fabrication-of-\nevidence claim, and we affirm on that basis. We reverse, how-\never, the district court’s denial of Hall’s motion to amend his\ncomplaint and remand to the district court with instructions to\nallow Hall to plead an explicit Fifth Amendment violation.\nThe exceptional circumstances in this case persuade us that a\nremand is necessary to avoid manifest injustice.\n\f11742            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nI.   Background\n\n   Some might call Hall an unlucky fellow. In October 1984,\nshortly after he turned 18, Hall witnessed a drive-by shooting\n(“the 54th Street shooting”). Ten people suffered gunshot\nwounds, five of whom died. Hall ended up with a broken nose\nin the ensuing melee.\n\n   The police persuaded Hall, who had no gang affiliation, to\ntestify in the 54th Street murder case. The State needed Hall\nto identify one of the triggermen, “Ace Capone,” an infamous\nmember of the Bloods gang. Hall’s cooperation with the\npolice put him in such serious danger that the police protected\nhis home every night for many months. Nevertheless, Hall\nfollowed through and testified at the preliminary hearing.\nMidway through his testimony, an attorney revealed Hall’s\nhome address. Hall abruptly left the stand, highly agitated and\nnervous. He had to be persuaded to finish testifying.\n\n  Following the preliminary hearing, the police continued to\nworry about Hall’s safety. Wayne Dufort, a detective on the\n54th Street case, wanted to keep Hall safe both for Hall’s own\nsake and to ensure his eyewitness testimony at trial. Dufort\nurged Hall to move a number of times, to no avail. Dufort\nalways was worried about Hall and thought that “there just\ndidn’t seem to be enough protection.”\n\n   Between the preliminary hearing and Hall’s arrest for rob-\nbery nine months later, Dufort visited Hall’s home regularly,\nsometimes daily. Dufort and Hall met in person about 200\ntimes during those months. These visits fostered a symbiotic\nfriendship of sorts between the two unlikely companions. In\naddition to being concerned for Hall’s safety, Dufort grew to\ncare for and like Hall during that time. The detective wanted\nto see Hall find a job, attain success and remain safe from any\nharm he risked by testifying in the 54th Street murder case.\nDufort even recommended Hall for a job and gave him a char-\nacter reference. For his part, Hall saw Dufort as a friend, and\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES             11743\nmaybe even as a father figure. Dufort gave Hall money,\nhelped him get a job and treated him with respect.\n\n   Meanwhile, someone murdered siblings Nola Duncan and\nDavid Rainey in June 1985 (“the Duncan-Rainey murders”).\nHall, who lived near the crime scene, gathered with other\ncurious neighbors to try to see what had happened. The close\nproximity of his home to where the police found Duncan’s\nbody appears to be Hall’s only connection, if one could call\nit that, to the crime.\n\n   The police had reason to believe that Theadry Art Powell,\nJr. committed the murders. Powell had a motive: Duncan sold\nPowell low-quality or doctored PCP hours before she died.\nWhen Powell discovered what Duncan had done, a witness\noverheard Powell exclaim, “I hate that bitch, go kill her!”\nbefore three men left Powell’s house. When questioned by\npolice, Powell initially claimed that he had not seen Duncan\nin three months, but later changed his story twice and admit-\nted he had seen her on the night she died. Powell ultimately\nimplicated two of his associates, Jerry Williams and Lonnie\nWardlow, suggesting that maybe one or both of them took\npart in Duncan’s murder. A polygrapher determined that both\nPowell and Wardlow falsely denied their involvement in Dun-\ncan’s killing. Despite these leads, the police did not investi-\ngate Powell, Williams or Wardlow as suspects in Duncan’s\nmurder.\n\n   The police arrested Hall for robbery in August 1985, six\nweeks after the Duncan-Rainey murders. Upon his arrest, Hall\nreached out to Dufort, seeking protection inside the jail from\ngang members who sought revenge for Hall’s testimony in the\n54th Street shooting case. Dufort arranged for Hall to be\nhoused with other informants. While his segregation from the\ngeneral population may have helped protect Hall from physi-\ncal attacks, he became a sitting duck for predatory informants.\nThree experienced jailhouse informants, with cases pending,\ndiscussed Duncan’s murder with Hall. Those informants then\n\f11744            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nfalsely implicated Hall in the Duncan-Rainey murders by con-\ncocting a story that Hall had confessed to the murders.\n\n   Detectives Arneson and Crocker, Appellees, worked on the\nDuncan-Rainey case and received information from these jail-\nhouse informants incriminating Hall. The first time Arneson\nand Crocker interviewed Hall, they asked him what he had\nheard about the Duncan-Rainey murders. Hall responded that\nhe “just heard some stuff” and that he was “just a witness.”\nThe officers did not read Hall his Miranda rights. The next\ninterview took place four days later and lasted about ten min-\nutes. Two days later, on September 11, 1985, Arneson called\nDufort. Arneson said that he planned to interview Hall and\ninsisted that Dufort be there, but would not say why. Dufort\ntried several times to avoid attending the interview because he\nwas too busy with other work, but ultimately agreed to meet\nArneson at the jail. Dufort arrived with his partner, Aaron\nMartin. They met with Arneson and Crocker, as well as with\ninformant Cornelius Lee. Lee identified Hall as the driver in\nthe 54th Street shooting, suggesting that Hall was not, in fact,\nan innocent witness as he had testified.\n\n   The police then interrogated Hall. First, Dufort and Martin\nquestioned Hall for several hours about the 54th Street shoot-\ning. Arneson and Crocker popped into the interview room to\nask if they could speak to Hall after Dufort and Martin were\nfinished. The police then moved Hall to a different booth\nwhere all four detectives questioned him about the Duncan-\nRainey murders. The detectives did not advise Hall of his\nMiranda rights. The detectives used a “we know more infor-\nmation than you think we know” technique in questioning\nhim.\n\n   The police asked Hall whether, before the murder, he was\nsmoking dope at a beauty shop with Duncan, whether he had\nsex with her and whether he had stabbed her. Hall denied\nstabbing Duncan or having anything to do with her murder,\nbut the police persisted. Arneson falsely claimed that the\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11745\npolice had found Hall’s semen in Duncan’s mouth and his fin-\ngerprints on her body. At this point, Hall became very afraid.\nHe asked for an attorney. Arneson asked Hall why he needed\nan attorney if he was innocent and said that the only people\nwho need attorneys are guilty and trying to hide something.\nArneson then told Hall that the police had found his footprint\nin the alley near Duncan’s body. Hall persisted in his denials.\n\n   Arneson then suggested that the police file charges against\nHall. Dufort warned Hall that if the police filed murder\ncharges against him and a jury convicted him, he would go to\nprison with Ace Capone, the Bloods gang member he testified\nagainst, and that Capone would kill him. Crocker added that,\nif Hall ended up in state prison, all the Bloods would be after\nhim for testifying against Capone and that all the Crips, the\nrival gang, would be after him for driving Capone to the 54th\nStreet shooting. Hall felt tired and hungry, but the detectives\nkept berating him. The police continued to reject Hall’s\nclaims that he had nothing to do with the murders.\n\n   Fear took over. Hall worried that if he did not confess, the\npolice would file murder charges. If he was convicted of mur-\nder, he would go to prison and be killed. He also worried that\nif he did not cooperate, the police would remove him from\nprotective housing and put him in the general population,\nwhere he would be in danger. Hall broke down and cried,\nhoping his display of emotion would inspire mercy. It did not.\n\n   Hall gave in to desperation, fear and fatigue. The police fed\nHall the “facts” about what happened the night of the Duncan-\nRainey murder. Hall either acquiesced to each statement or\nrepeated it back to Arneson. Hall both initialed next to mis-\ntakes in the statement Crocker had handwritten and signed the\nstatement at the bottom, as the police directed. He did not\nread the statement. This interrogation lasted somewhere\nbetween two and six hours, and the police did not afford Hall\nany food or bathroom breaks.\n\f11746             HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   After Arneson and Crocker left, Dufort and Martin contin-\nued to interrogate Hall about the 54th Street shooting case\nuntil the early morning. In all, Hall was questioned between\n17 and 19 hours that day. Hall was handcuffed during the\ninterrogations and denied food.\n\n   The State charged Hall with the murders of Duncan and\nRainey. No physical or forensic evidence connected Hall to\nthe murders. The sole evidence admitted at trial comprised\nHall’s confession and two documents provided by jailhouse\ninformant Lee—the same Lee who implicated Hall as the\ndriver in the 54th Street shooting. Lee had the cell next to\nHall. Lee and Hall had passed sheets of paper back and forth\nbetween their cells, with Lee sending over written questions\nand Hall sending back written responses. Hall’s answers, gen-\nerally innocuous taken by themselves, appeared to incriminate\nhim in the Duncan murder. Expert testimony at trial estab-\nlished that the handwriting on the notes belonged to both Hall\nand Lee. Many years after trial, Lee admitted that he had\nerased and re-written the questions after Hall answered them,\nmaking it look as though Hall had confessed to killing Dun-\ncan, when he had not in fact done so.\n\n   Hall was convicted of the Duncan-Rainey murders based\non the confession Crocker wrote and the falsified documents\nLee gave to the police. Hall spent nineteen years in prison.\nWe granted his habeas petition in 2004, upon determining that\nHall’s conviction was predicated on the documents Lee falsi-\nfied, resulting in a denial of due process. Hall v. Dir. of Corr.,\n343 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). The State did not\nretry Hall, and he was released from custody in August 2004.\nHall now works full-time for the Los Angeles County Bar\nAssociation coordinating the Indigent Criminal Defense\nAppointments Program.\n\n  Following his release, Hall brought this action for damages\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The district court, with Judge\nSchiavelli presiding, granted Appellees’ first summary judg-\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES             11747\nment motion. We reversed and remanded on two issues. First,\nHall based his claim against the individual detectives on\nDevereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (en\nbanc), which held that defendants enjoy a constitutional right\nto be free from prosecution based on deliberately fabricated\nevidence. We held that the district court wrongly precluded\nHall’s claim based on Devereaux prong (2) that the individual\ndetectives used such abusive and coercive investigative tech-\nniques that they knew or should have known that those tech-\nniques would yield false information. In addition, we\ndisagreed with the district court that Hall had abandoned his\nmunicipal liability claim. Hall v. City of Los Angeles, No. 07-\n56853, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 15428 (9th Cir. July 13, 2009)\n(unpublished).\n\n   On remand, the district court, with Chief Judge Collins pre-\nsiding, again granted summary judgment for Appellees. The\ndistrict court held that Hall’s coerced interrogation claim was\nnot cognizable under Devereaux prong (2) and concluded that\neven if Devereaux applied, Hall had not raised triable issues\nof fact to support his fabrication-of-evidence claim. The court\nalso granted qualified immunity to the officers. This timely\nappeal followed.\n\nII.   Standard of Review\n\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We\nreview de novo both the district court’s compliance with our\nmandate, Snow-Erlin v. United States, 470 F.3d 804, 807 (9th\nCir. 2006), and its order granting summary judgment,\nBamonte v. City of Mesa, 598 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.\n2010). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to\nHall, the non-moving party, to determine whether any genuine\nissues of material fact exist. Id., 598 F.3d at 1220. If not,\nAppellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.\n\f11748               HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nIII.    Discussion\n\n  A.        Fabrication-of-Evidence Claim\n\n       1.    Law of the Case and the Rule of Mandate\n\n  At the outset we must determine whether the law of the\ncase or the rule of mandate precluded the district court from\ndetermining the applicability of Devereaux prong (2) to Hall’s\ncoercive interrogation claim. They did not.\n\n   The law of the case doctrine, a judicial invention, aims to\npromote the efficient operation of the courts. Milgard Tem-\npering, Inc. v. Selas Corp. of Am., 902 F.2d 703, 715 (9th Cir.\n1990). It generally preludes a court from reconsidering an\nissue decided previously by the same court or by a higher\ncourt in the identical case. United States v. Lummi Indian\nTribe, 235 F.3d 443, 452 (9th Cir. 2000). The issue in ques-\ntion must have been decided explicitly or by necessary impli-\ncation in the previous disposition. Id. Application of the\ndoctrine is discretionary. We therefore review the district\ncourt’s decision for abuse of discretion. See Milgard Temper-\ning, 902 F.2d at 715.\n\n   “The rule of mandate is similar to, but broader than, the law\nof the case doctrine.” United States v. Cote, 51 F.3d 178, 181\n(9th Cir. 1995). A district court that has received the mandate\nof an appellate court cannot vary or examine that mandate for\nany purpose other than executing it. Id. At the same time, the\nrule of mandate allows a lower court to decide anything not\nforeclosed by the mandate. Herrington v. County of Sonoma,\n12 F.3d 901, 904 (9th Cir. 1993). A district court is limited\nby our remand when the scope of the remand is clear.\nMendez-Gutierrez v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir.\n2006). Violation of the rule of mandate is a jurisdictional\nerror. United States v. Thrasher, 483 F.3d 977, 982 (9th Cir.\n2007).\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11749\n   Here, the district court did not violate the law of the case.\nThe applicability of Devereaux prong (2) to Hall’s coercive\ninterrogation claim had never been considered or decided by\nany court. Our prior decision remanding to the district court\nstated only that the opinion granting Hall habeas relief did not\npreclude his § 1983 claim for a Devereaux prong (2) viola-\ntion. The decision did not then go on to analyze whether\nDevereaux prong (2) applied to Hall’s coercive interrogation\nclaim. Hall, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 15428, *4-5.\n\n   Nor did the district court violate the rule of mandate, as it\nwas free to decide anything not foreclosed by the mandate.\nSee Herrington, 12 F.3d at 904. The mandate stated, “Because\nthe district court’s decision regarding collateral estoppel pre-\nvented the court and the parties from discovering and consid-\nering the evidence relating to Devereaux prong (2), we\nreverse the district court on its determination of prong (2).”\nHall, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 15428, at *5. We did not impose\nclear limits on the scope of the remand. See Mendez-\nGutierrez, 444 F.3d at 1172. Moreover, when a court is con-\nfronted with issues that the remanding court never considered,\nthe “mandate[ ] require[s] respect for what the higher court\ndecided, not for what it did not decide.” United States v. Kel-\nlington, 217 F.3d 1084, 1093 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The\ndistrict court properly considered whether Hall’s coercive\ninterrogation claim fell within the purview of Devereaux\nprong (2).\n\n    2.   Cognizability of Coercive Interrogation Claim\n\n   Next we turn to the merits of the summary judgment\nmotion granted below. We must consider the district court’s\nconclusion that Hall could not proceed on the theory, pursuant\nto Devereaux prong (2), that his interrogation constituted fab-\nrication of evidence in violation of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. The district court did not err.\n\f11750            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   [1] “Section 1983 creates a private right of action against\nindividuals who, acting under color of state law, violate fed-\neral constitutional or statutory rights.” Devereaux, 263 F.3d at\n1074. Section 1983 “is not itself a source of substantive\nrights, but merely provides a method for vindicating federal\nrights elsewhere conferred.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S.\n386, 393-94 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). Thus, the nature of a Section 1983 action requires\nus to determine whether the right Hall identifies is in fact the\none that was allegedly infringed. See id. at 394.\n\n   [2] Hall asserts a Fourteenth Amendment due process\nclaim, predicated on Devereaux prong (2), that “there is a\nclearly established constitutional due process right not to be\nsubjected to criminal charges on the basis of false evidence\nthat was deliberately fabricated by the government.”\nDevereaux, 263 F.3d at 1074-75. We derived this right from\nthe Supreme Court’s holding in Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213,\n216 (1942), that “the knowing use by the prosecution of per-\njured testimony in order to secure a criminal conviction vio-\nlates the Constitution.” Devereaux, 263 F.3d at 1075. To\nsupport a Devereaux deliberate-fabrication-of-evidence claim,\na plaintiff:\n\n    must, at a minimum, point to evidence that supports\n    at least one of the following two propositions: (1)\n    Defendants continued their investigation of [plain-\n    tiff] despite the fact that they knew or should have\n    known that he was innocent; or (2) Defendants used\n    investigative techniques that were so coercive and\n    abusive that they knew or should have known that\n    those techniques would yield false information.\n\nId. at 1076. The only Devereaux issue before us relates to\nprong (2). See Hall, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 15428, at *3-5.\nWe must determine whether Hall has put forth specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether\nArneson and Crocker used techniques so coercive and abusive\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES            11751\nin interrogating Hall that they knew or should have known\nthose techniques would generate false evidence. Devereaux,\n263 F.3d at 1076.\n\n   [3] But it is the Fifth Amendment, not the Fourteenth\nAmendment, that governs Hall’s claim. “Where a particular\nAmendment provides an explicit textual source of constitu-\ntional protection against a particular sort of government\nbehavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of\nsubstantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing such\na claim.” Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994) (inter-\nnal quotations and citations omitted). The Fifth Amendment\nprovides that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V.\nUsing a coerced confession against the accused in a criminal\nproceeding implicates this Fifth Amendment privilege. E.g.,\nCrowe v. County of San Diego, 608 F.3d 406, 427-29 (9th Cir.\n2010) (discussing Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 765\n(2003) (plurality). Here, Hall claims that the detectives\ncoerced his confession and then used that confession to secure\nhis conviction. Thus, the Fifth Amendment is the explicit con-\nstitutional provision that governs Hall’s claim.\n\n   [4] Hall has not brought a Fifth Amendment claim regard-\ning his confession, however. While Hall did seek to amend his\ncomplaint to add an explicit Fifth Amendment claim, Judge\nSchiavelli denied that motion. This is where Devereaux prong\n(2) comes into play. Most likely because Hall’s complaint\ndoes not include a Fifth Amendment claim, Hall alleges that\nAppellees violated his Fourteenth Amendment substantive\ndue process right not to suffer a conviction based on deliber-\nately fabricated evidence. He attempts mightily to make his\ncoerced confession claim fit within a fabrication-of-evidence\nframework. However artful this argument may be, it comes to\nnothing. As the district court held, Hall “cannot remedy his\ninadequate pleading now by repackaging a Fifth Amendment\ncoerced interrogation claim as one for deliberate fabrication\nof evidence arising under the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\f11752             HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   A survey of our caselaw confirms that Hall misses the mark\nwhen he construes his coerced-confession claim as properly\ncognizable under Devereaux prong (2). The facts in\nDevereaux concerned the investigation of alleged sex abuse\ninvolving lengthy and improper interviews of purported child\nvictims. 263 F.3d at 1073. These children did not endure\ncoerced interrogation techniques as suspects, but as third par-\nties. Moreover, in finding a right to be free from deliberately\nfabricated evidence in Devereaux, we relied in part on Pyle.\nThat case involved perjured testimony, also furnished by third\nparties. 317 U.S. at 214. In fact, all of our published cases that\nfollow Devereaux concern interview techniques used to elicit\nevidence from third-party witnesses, not the coerced interro-\ngation of a suspect. See, e.g., Stoot v. City of Everett, 582 F.3d\n910, 919 n.9 (9th Cir. 2009) (discussing claim that detective\ncoerced child victim); Gausvik v. Perez, 345 F.3d 813, 816-17\n(9th Cir. 2003) (discussing claim that police officer used\n“overbearing tactics” in interviewing victims of alleged sex\nabuse); Cunningham v. City of Wenatchee, 345 F.3d 802, 812\n(9th Cir. 2003) (discussing claim that officers used coercive\ntactics when interviewing suspect’s daughters). The one case\nthat did not involve third party witnesses also did not involve\nthe coercive interrogation of a suspect. See Costanich v. Dep’t\nof Soc. & Health Servs., 627 F.3d 1101, 1111-14 (finding due\nprocess right to be free from deliberately fabricated evidence\nin a child abuse proceeding where plaintiff produced evidence\nthat a social worker deliberately falsified statements).\n\n   [5] There is no question that the interrogation tactics Hall\nalleges trouble us, but we are bound by the law as it stands.\nHall’s coerced confession claim falls within the explicit lan-\nguage of the Fifth Amendment and does not arise as a subset\nof the substantive due process right set forth in Devereaux\nprong (2). We have little choice but to affirm the grant of\nsummary judgment to Appellees. Because we affirm the con-\nclusion below that Devereaux prong (2) does not apply to\nHall’s coerced confession claim, we have no occasion to con-\nsider the district court’s holding that Hall did not create triable\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11753\nissues of fact in support of his deliberate fabrication-of-\nevidence claim.\n\n    3.    Qualified Immunity\n\n   The district court did not err in granting qualified immunity\nto Arneson and Crocker. They are entitled to qualified immu-\nnity unless (1) Hall has alleged facts that make out a violation\nof a constitutional right and (2) that constitutional right was\nclearly established at the time of the officers’ alleged miscon-\nduct. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009) (citing\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)).\n\n   [6] As discussed, Hall’s right to be free from criminal\ncharges based on evidence deliberately fabricated by the gov-\nernment does not encompass Hall’s coerced confession claim.\nHall, therefore, has not alleged facts that would establish the\nviolation of his constitutional rights. The detectives therefore\nenjoy qualified immunity as to this claim, and we need not\naddress whether the right Hall asserts was clearly established\nat the time of his interrogation. See id. at 232-36.\n\n    4.    Municipal Liability\n\n   Because Hall has not presented evidence creating a triable\nissue of fact that Appellees violated his constitutional rights,\nwe need not reach the issue of municipal liability pursuant to\nMonell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694\n(1978). See Aguilera v. Baca, 510 F.3d 1161, 1174 (9th Cir.\n2007).\n\n  B.     Fifth Amendment Coerced Confession Claim\n\n   [7] At oral argument, we asked the parties whether we\nhave the authority to remand this matter to the district court\nwith instructions to allow Hall to amend his complaint to\nallege an explicit Fifth Amendment coerced confession claim.\nWe also asked the parties whether, if we do in fact have the\n\f11754             HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nauthority to remand this case to the district court, we should\nexercise our discretion to do so. To give the parties a full and\nfair opportunity to address these questions, we also ordered\nsupplemental briefing.\n\n    1.   Jurisdiction\n\n  Before considering the propriety of remanding this matter,\nwe must ensure that we have appellate jurisdiction to consider\nsua sponte whether the district court erred in denying Hall’s\nrequest to amend the complaint to incorporate an explicit\nFifth Amendment claim. See Rowe v. United States, 633 F.2d\n799, 800 (9th Cir. 1980). We do.\n\n   “The courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals\nfrom all final decisions of the district courts of the United\nStates . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. An order denying leave to\namend a complaint is not appealable. Bradshaw v. Zoological\nSoc’y. of San Diego, 662 F.2d 1301, 1304 (9th Cir. 1981).\n“Such orders, as a class, contemplate further proceedings in\nthe district court, and [we] ha[ve] previously held that review\nis available after the final judgment, into which they merge.”\nId. Once a district court enters final judgment and a party\nappeals, however, those earlier, non-final orders become\nreviewable. Licthfield v. Spielberg, 736 F.2d 1352, 1355 (9th\nCir. 1984) (“An appeal from a final judgment draws in ques-\ntion all earlier, non-final orders and rulings which produced\nthe judgment.”). This is so because the earlier non-final orders\nmerge with the judgment. Bradshaw, 662 F.2d at 1304.\n\n   [8] This case comes to us on a timely notice of appeal of\nthe district court’s summary judgment, a final order. By\nappealing the final judgment, Hall implicitly brought all of the\ndistrict court’s subordinate orders within the jurisdiction of\nour court. Chacon v. Wood, 36 F.3d 1459, 1468 (9th Cir.\n1994) (“When reviewing final judgments in civil proceedings\nwe have jurisdiction to review any interlocutory orders or\nother rulings that may have affected the outcome below.”),\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES               11755\nsuperseded on other grounds by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c); U.S.\nDominator, Inc. v. Factory Ship Robert E. Resoff, 768 F.2d\n1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 1985) (“While we recognize the impor-\ntance of correcting erroneous interlocutory rulings as early as\npossible, the failure to challenge an erroneous interlocutory\nruling does not make the error appeal proof when the final\njudgment comes before this court for review”), superseded on\nother grounds by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c); cf. Sackett v. Beaman,\n399 F.2d 884, 889 n.6 (9th Cir. 1968) (“[T]he question of\nwhether there was an abuse of discretion in denying leave to\namend can be reviewed under the final judgment notwith-\nstanding the fact that such judgment makes no reference to\nsuch denial. All interlocutory rulings merged in the final\njudgement and are reviewable on appeal therefrom.”); see\nalso Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Jackson, 235 F.2d 390,\n392 (10th Cir. 1956) (“[F]or purposes of appeal, an interlocu-\ntory action from which no direct appeal will lie becomes\nmerged into the final judgment and is open to review on\nappeal from the final judgment”).\n\n   [9] Hall has satisfied the statutory requirements of jurisdic-\ntion. Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B); see also Smith v. Barry, 502\nU.S. 244, 247-48 (“Courts will liberally construe the require-\nments of Rule 3.”); Ortberg v. Moody, 961 F.2d 135, 137 (9th\nCir. 1992) (“The purpose of Rule 3 is to ensure that the other\nparty is informed of the intent to appeal.”); Munoz v. Small\nBus. Admin., 644 F.2d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding\nthat “an appeal from the final judgment draws in question all\nearlier non-final orders and all rulings which produced the\njudgment” and also that a second judgment calls into question\nthe propriety of the first, giving the court jurisdiction over\nboth). We therefore have jurisdiction to review the district\ncourt’s earlier denial of Hall’s motion to amend in connection\nwith our review of the final judgment now before us.\n\n    2.   Manifest Injustice\n\n  [10] Having satisfied ourselves that we have jurisdiction,\nwe next ask whether we can and should remand for amend-\n\f11756            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nment of the complaint. Ordinarily, we refrain from consider-\ning an issue that a party has failed to raise. Laboda v.\nCalderon, 224 F.3d 972, 985 (9th Cir. 2000). We note, how-\never, two exceptions to this general practice, both of which\nhave force here: We may consider an issue sua sponte if fail-\nure to do so would result in manifest injustice, or if the oppos-\ning party will not suffer prejudice. Id.; see also Kohler v.\nInter-Tel Techs., 244 F.3d 1167, 1182 (9th Cir. 2001); United\nStates v. Ullah, 976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n   [11] The extraordinary circumstances here convince us that\nwe must remand this matter for amendment of the complaint\nin order to prevent a woefully unjust result. A jury convicted\nHall of murder, a crime he did not commit, based only on his\nconfession and falsified documents manufactured by a jail-\nhouse informant. Hall served nineteen years in prison. Detec-\ntives interrogated an eighteen-year-old Hall for up to six\nhours, with no Miranda advisement. He was handcuffed and\ndenied food. When Hall asked for an attorney, Arneson asked\nwhy Hall needed an attorney if he did not commit the crime.\nArneson also told Hall that only guilty people who were try-\ning to hide something needed attorneys. Dufort, the detective\nHall had grown to see as a trusted friend and father figure,\ncautioned Hall that murder charges would lead to a convic-\ntion, which would land Hall in prison with Ace Capone and\nthat Capone would kill him. Crocker then added that Hall\nwould find himself in serious danger if he ended up in state\nprison because the Bloods would want revenge for his testi-\nmony in the 54th Street case, and the Crips would want\nrevenge for Hall driving Capone during the 54th Street shoot-\ning. Hall—weary, hungry and terrified for his life and safety\n—finally confessed to the crime with “facts” that Arneson\nspoon-fed him. Hall initialed and signed the statement, but he\nnever read it. The police interrogated Hall, handcuffed, for\nsomewhere between 17 and 19 hours that day.\n\n  [12] Certainly, on these facts, Hall’s § 1983 counsel should\nhave pled a Fifth Amendment coerced confession claim in the\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11757\ninitial complaint. That error turned out to be unfortunate and,\nwithout remand for amendment of the complaint, would prove\ndire to Hall’s case. But we cannot escape the fact that justice\neluded Hall during his highly suspect, and constitutionally\nquestionable, interrogation. Justice eluded Hall when he suf-\nfered a conviction based on that confession and the patently\nfalse inculpatory evidence created by a jailhouse informant.\nJustice eluded Hall when he served nineteen years in state\nprison for a crime he did not commit. And justice will elude\nHall yet again without the opportunity to amend his complaint\nand let a jury decide whether he deserves monetary compen-\nsation for his unlawful incarceration. If ever there were an\nexceptional case where we should exercise our discretionary\npower to avoid manifest injustice, we believe this must be it.\nSee United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160 (1936) (“In\nexceptional circumstances, especially in criminal cases, appel-\nlate courts, in the public interest, may, of their own motion,\nnotice errors to which no exception has been taken, if the\nerrors are obvious, or if they otherwise seriously affect the\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed-\nings.”); cf. United States v. Ullah, 976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir.\n1992) (finding manifest injustice despite defendant raising\nclaim only in reply brief).\n\n    3.   Prejudice to Appellees\n\n   [13] We find Appellees’ contention that they had no fair\nnotice of Hall’s Fifth Amendment claim curious, if not disin-\ngenuous. While Hall did not identify an explicit Fifth Amend-\nment claim, his 2005 complaint alleged facts that form the\nbasis of a classic coerced confession claim. Hall claimed that\nthe detectives (1) did not give him a Miranda admonition any\nof the times they interviewed or interrogated him, (2) told\nHall he would be murdered in prison if he did not confess and\n(3) subjected him to combined interrogations totaling 17 to 19\nhours. Moreover, we provided the parties the opportunity to\nbrief this issue. Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir.\n2001) (citing United States v. Gamma Tech Indus., Inc., 265\n\f11758            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nF.3d 917, 930 (9th Cir. 2001)). On the record before us, we\ncannot conclude that amendment of the complaint would\ncause Appellees undue prejudice.\n\n    4.   Denial of Request to Amend\n\n   We now consider whether the district court erred in deny-\ning Hall’s motion to amend. We review the denial of a motion\nto amend for abuse of discretion. Jackson v. Bank of Haw.,\n902 F.2d 1385, 1387 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n   Two years after filing his complaint, Hall sought leave to\namend his complaint to add an explicit Fifth Amendment\nclaim. The district court denied this request upon a finding\nthat Hall failed to meet and confer and that amendment would\nprejudice Appellees because of undue delay. District Court\nDocket Nos. 85 (citing United States ex rel. Schumer v.\nHughes Aircraft Co., 63 F.3d 1512, 1527 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(affirming denial of motion to amend where plaintiff waited\nthree years to amend, amendment would have required addi-\ntional discovery and plaintiff had amended the complaint once\nbefore)). The district court abused its discretion in prohibiting\namendment of the complaint.\n\n   [14] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a\nparty may amend its pleading once as a matter of course\nwithin certain time limits, or, in all other instances, with the\ncourt’s leave. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Because the relevant time\nperiod had elapsed for an amendment as a matter of course,\nHall sought the court’s permission to amend. When a party\nrequests to amend a pleading, “[t]he court should freely give\nleave when justice so requires.” Id.; see also Wyshak v. City\nNat’l Bank, 607 F.2d 824, 826-27 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam)\n(finding no abuse of discretion where district court allowed\namendment of answer to assert statute of limitations because\nthe defense existed at the time plaintiff sued). “[T]his mandate\nis to be heeded.” Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).\n“If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11759\nplaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be\nafforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.” Id.\nMoreover, “[i]n the absence of any apparent or declared\nreason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on\nthe part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to the opposing\nparty by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of\namendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules\nrequire, be ‘freely given.’ ” Id.\n\n   [15] Here, the district court’s reliance on Hall’s failure to\nmeet and confer falls outside the supportable bases for deny-\ning a motion to amend. The district court also found that\namendment would prejudice Appellees because Hall waited\ntwo years from the filing of his initial complaint to add his\nFifth Amendment claim. As we have noted, however, the\ncomplaint gave Appellees fair notice of the facts supporting\nthe coerced interrogation claim. Moreover, it is questionable\nwhether amendment would have required additional discov-\nery, given the extensive discovery the parties had conducted\nalready.\n\n   An ordinary case in which counsel neglected to allege an\nobvious claim in a pleading would not warrant sua sponte\nconsideration of an issue, nor would we feel compelled to find\nan abuse of discretion. But we are not called to consider an\nordinary case, but, rather, an extraordinary one involving an\nunfortunate confluence of events—events not fit for a just and\nfair society. We are reminded today that as jurists we hold the\npower to protect individuals against arbitrary government\naction and abuse of power. See, e.g., Daniels v. Williams, 474\nU.S. 327, 331 (1986). In remanding this matter to the district\ncourt, we intend to safeguard the fairness, integrity and repu-\ntation of our courts, by making justice possible for Hall. See\nAtkinson, 297 U.S. at 160.\n\nIV.   Conclusion\n\n   [16] We affirm the grant of summary judgment to Appel-\nlees on Hall’s fabrication of evidence claim. We reverse the\n\f11760            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\ndenial of Hall’s motion for leave to amend his complaint and\nremand to the district court to allow Hall to allege an explicit\ncoercive interrogation claim pursuant to the Fifth Amend-\nment.\n\n AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in                            part,\nREMANDED. Each side shall bear its own costs.\n\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Not content with our task, prescribed by Article III, of\ndeciding the controversies raised by the parties, the majority\nhas decided to ask and answer its own legal questions instead.\nAt oral argument, the majority sua sponte raised the possibil-\nity that instead of addressing Harold Hall’s sole argument on\nappeal that the district court had erred in rejecting his Four-\nteenth Amendment claim, we could revive and address an\nunrelated and unappealed procedural issue: whether, over five\nyears earlier, the district court had erred in denying Hall’s\nmotion to amend his complaint to add a new Fifth Amend-\nment claim.\n\n   Today, the majority takes itself up on that offer. It begins\nby creating a novel legal argument for Hall and then, having\nconcluded that its own argument has merit, it proceeds to\nresolve the case on those grounds. Maj. Op. at III.B. In doing\nso, the majority disregards the most basic principles of judi-\ncial restraint, erroneously overturns a district court decision\nthat we have no jurisdiction to review, and gives Hall relief\nthat he never asked us to give. While the majority claims that\nthese imprudent steps are necessary to “safeguard the fairness,\nintegrity and reputation of our courts,” maj. op. at 11759, I\nfear that they will have the exact opposite effect. I dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n   Because the majority’s impassioned retelling of Hall’s\nstory is economical with the procedural facts relevant to this\nappeal, I will begin by outlining them here.\n\f                     HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    11761\n                                     A\n\n   In 2003, a split panel of this court granted Hall’s habeas\npetition on the grounds that “false and material evidence was\nadmitted at Hall’s trial in violation of his due process rights,”\nand the state court’s contrary ruling was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. Hall v. Dir. of Corrections, 343\nF.3d 976, 985 (9th Cir. 2003) (Hall I). Hall I rejected Hall’s\nother constitutional claims, including his Fifth Amendment\nclaims for violation of his Miranda rights and right against\nself-incrimination, stating “[w]e have examined the record\nand find that these claims are without merit.” Id. at 981 n.5.\n\n  In March 2005, Hall brought suit for money damages under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Los Angeles, the Los\nAngeles Police Department, and various police officers\ninvolved in his prosecution. He alleged claims for relief based\non his unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment\nand the use of false evidence against him at trial in violation\nof his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.\n\n  Some two years later, in May 2007, after the close of dis-\ncovery and less than five months before the scheduled trial,\nHall moved to amend his complaint. The proposed amended\ncomplaint dropped Hall’s Fourth Amendment claim, which\nhad become time-barred in light of a recent Supreme Court\ncase, and added an entirely new claim for violation of his\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.1\n  1\n   Hall’s motion to amend asserts that “plaintiff is adding no new claim”\nto the amended complaint, but this assertion is belied by the amended\ncomplaint itself (attached to the motion), which provides a redlined com-\nparison with the original complaint. For example, paragraph 37 of the\namended complaint begins:\n      Plaintiff has a right to be free from unreasonable seizures being\n      a witness against himself, as protected by the Fourth Fifth\n      Amendment. . . .”\n\f11762            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   The City objected to the proposed amendment. First, the\nCity asserted that, contrary to his declaration, Hall had failed\nto follow local rules requiring the parties to meet and confer\nprior to the filing of any motion to amend. See C.D. Cal.\nLocal Rule 7-3. Second, according to the City, Hall had\nunduly delayed his attempt to amend the complaint: he knew\nall the facts underlying his Fifth Amendment claim when he\noriginally filed suit in March 2005, yet he unreasonably\nwaited over two years to add that new claim. Further, the City\ncontended, this amendment would be prejudicial because it\nwould require the City to prepare for an entirely new constitu-\ntional claim with only months to go before trial and without\nthe benefit of additional discovery. The district court agreed,\nholding that Hall had failed to comply with the requirement\nto meet and confer, and also that his undue delay in amending\nhis complaint would be prejudicial to the City. Accordingly,\non June 19, 2007, it denied Hall’s motion for leave to amend\nhis complaint.\n\n   The City then filed a motion for summary judgment on\nHall’s one remaining claim: that the City’s police officers vio-\nlated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by using\ninterrogation techniques so coercive that they knew the inter-\nrogation would generate false evidence. The district court\ngranted summary judgment to the City on this claim, partly\nbecause it concluded that Hall I’s determination that Hall’s\nself-incrimination claim was “without merit,” Hall I, 343 F.3d\nat 981 n.5, had a preclusive effect on Hall’s Fourteenth\nAmendment false evidence claim, which also focused on the\npolice officers’ allegedly coercive interrogation tactics.\n\n   In December 2007, Hall filed a notice of appeal stating his\nintent to appeal the district court’s order granting the City’s\nsummary judgment motion. Neither the notice of appeal nor\nHall’s appellate briefing made any mention of the district\ncourt’s June 2007 denial of his motion to amend his com-\nplaint. Instead, Hall challenged the district court’s determina-\ntion that Hall I precluded his Fourteenth Amendment claim,\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES               11763\nand reiterated his argument that his Fourteenth Amendment\nright to be free from prosecution based on false evidence had\nbeen violated. In July 2009, a different panel of this court\nreversed the district court’s conclusion that Hall I had a pre-\nclusive effect, and remanded for further consideration of\nHall’s Fourteenth Amendment false evidence claim. Hall v.\nCity of Los Angeles, 2009 WL 2020851 (9th Cir. 2009) (Hall\nII).\n\n   On remand, the district court again granted summary judg-\nment to the City. First, the court held that Hall’s claim was\nnot cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment, but should\nhave been raised as a violation of his Fifth Amendment right\nagainst self-incrimination. Second, the district court ruled that\neven if Hall’s claim was cognizable under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, there was no genuine issue of material fact that\nthe City’s police officers had generated false evidence. Hall\nfiled a notice of appeal challenging the district court’s order\ngranting the City summary judgment.\n\n                               B\n\n   This second appeal is now before us. As in his first appeal,\nHall advances no argument that the district court erred in June\n2007 when it denied his motion to add a Fifth Amendment\nclaim to his complaint. In fact, the gist of Hall’s argument is\nthat the district court erred in holding that his claim was cog-\nnizable only under the Fifth Amendment for the simple reason\nthat he was not bringing a Fifth Amendment claim. Rather, he\nwas bringing a broader Fourteenth Amendment claim that the\nofficers “fabricated the evidence (including but not limited to\nthe false confession)” that was used to prosecute him. The\nCity’s briefing responds to Hall’s Fourteenth Amendment\narguments.\n\n   Thus, on appeal, we should address the question Hall actu-\nally raised: whether his Fourteenth Amendment false evi-\ndence claim survives summary judgment. Hall relies on our\n\f11764               HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nen banc decision in Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070 (9th\nCir. 2001) (en banc), to argue that his due process rights were\nviolated because the City’s police officers used “investigative\ntechniques that were so coercive and abusive that they knew\nor should have known that those techniques would yield false\ninformation.” Id. at 1076. But, as the majority explains, we\nhave never applied Devereaux’s prohibition against the fabri-\ncation of evidence to adjudicate claims involving the coercive\ninterrogation of a suspect. Maj. Op. at 11752. Whereas\nDevereaux relies on the “scarce and open-ended” guideposts\nof substantive due process, Collins v. City of Harker Heights,\nTex., 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992), the “explicit textual source”\nof the Fifth Amendment protects a suspect from coercive\ninterrogation, Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994).\nAccordingly, Hall’s claim that the City used his coerced con-\nfession to convict him is cognizable under the Fifth Amend-\nment, not the Fourteenth Amendment. See Albright, 510 U.S.\nat 273. Because Hall has not brought a Fifth Amendment\nclaim, we must affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the City on Hall’s Fourteenth Amendment claim.2\nThe majority agrees with this Fourteenth Amendment analysis\nand thus, it correctly affirms the district court’s grant of sum-\nmary judgment to the City on Hall’s Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims. That ruling should end this case. It is all that the par-\nties asked us to decide.\n\n                                   II\n\n   But that is not all the majority wants to decide. After reject-\ning Hall’s argument as a failed “repackaging [of] a Fifth\nAmendment coerced interrogation claim as one for deliberate\nfabrication of evidence arising under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment,” maj. op. at 11751, the majority then proceeds sua\nsponte to offer Hall a different, unasked for, package of relief:\na second chance to add a Fifth Amendment claim to his com-\n  2\n   For similar reasons, we must also affirm the district court’s grant of\nqualified immunity to the City’s police officers.\n\f                     HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                   11765\nplaint, five years, two summary judgments, and two notices\nof appeal after the fact. To do so, the majority posits an appeal\n(one not actually brought by Hall) from the district court’s\nJune 2007 order denying Hall’s motion to amend his com-\nplaint; asserts appellate jurisdiction over this theoretical\nappeal; posits an argument (one not actually raised by Hall)\nfor why the district court abused its discretion by denying\nHall’s motion to amend his complaint; and relies on that argu-\nment to conclude that the district court did abuse its discre-\ntion. This enterprise has no basis in precedent and disregards\nmany of our long-standing jurisdictional and procedural limi-\ntations.\n\n                                    A\n\n   The majority begins by skipping over the most important\nlimitation on a federal court: our jurisdiction. Here, we are\nsimply without authority to review this “appeal” of the district\ncourt’s long-forgotten denial of Hall’s motion to amend. It is\na basic requirement of appellate jurisdiction that “[t]he notice\nof appeal must . . . designate the judgment, order or part\nthereof being appealed from.” Fed. R. App. Proc. 3(c);3 see\nSmith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992) (“[N]oncompliance\n[with Rule 3] is fatal to an appeal.”); Torres v. Oakland Scav-\nenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 317 n.3 (1988) (refusing to waive\na noncompliant notice of appeal because “a litigant’s failure\nto clear a jurisdictional hurdle can never be ‘harmless’ or\nwaived by a court.”). Hall’s notice of appeal identifies only\n  3\n   Rule 3(c)(1) provides that\n      The notice of appeal must:\n          (A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming\n          each one in the caption or body of the notice . . .\n          (B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being\n          appealed; and\n          (C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\nFed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1).\n\f11766               HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nthe second summary judgment; he does not designate the dis-\ntrict court’s June 2007 denial of leave to amend his complaint\nas a subject of appeal, nor does he provide any indication of\nan intent to challenge that order in his briefing or argument\nto this court. Cf. Shapiro ex rel. Shapiro v. Paradise Valley\nUnified School Dist. No. 69, 374 F.3d 857, 863-64 (9th Cir.\n2004) (holding that an insufficient notice of appeal was reme-\ndied by sufficient appellate briefing).\n\n   The majority claims it has jurisdiction because “earlier,\nnon-final orders become reviewable” once a district court\nenters a final judgment. Maj. Op. at 11754. While the major-\nity is correct in explaining when an interlocutory order satis-\nfies the finality requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1291, the\nmajority ignores the separate jurisdictional bar provided by\nRule 3. Even if an interlocutory order becomes sufficiently\nfinal by merging with a later final judgment, the appellant\nmust still identify the prior order in the notice of appeal or\ndiscuss it in its appellate briefing in order to demonstrate\nsome intent to appeal it. See Lynn v. Sheet Metal Workers’\nInt’l Ass’n, 804 F.2d 1472, 1481 (9th Cir. 1986). That was not\ndone here.4 Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider the\ndistrict court’s June 2007 order denying Hall leave to amend\nhis complaint to add a Fifth Amendment claim. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v. Smithsonian, Inst., 189 F.3d 180, 185 n.2 (2d Cir.\n   4\n     The majority does not just liberally construe Rule 3’s requirements, it\nignores them entirely: the notice of appeal here raises no inference of an\nintent to appeal the district court’s June 2007 order. Cf. Munoz v. Small\nBus. Admin., 644 F.2d 1361, 1364 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding that “the rule\nis well settled that a mistake in designating the judgment appealed from\nshould not result in loss of the appeal as long as the intent to appeal from\na specific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee\nis not misled by the mistake.”) (emphasis added). But liberally applying\na jurisdictional requirement is not the same as eliminating it, which the\nmajority has effectively done here. See Smith, 502 U.S. at 248 (“This prin-\nciple of liberal construction does not, however, excuse noncompliance\nwith [Rule 3].”); Torres, 487 U.S. at 315-16 (“Permitting imperfect but\nsubstantial compliance with a technical requirement is not the same as\nwaiving the requirement altogether as a jurisdictional threshold.”).\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11767\n1999) (dismissing an appeal of an order denying leave to\namend a complaint for lack of compliance with Rule 3(c));\nCapital Parks, Inc. v. Southeastern Ad. and Sales Sys., Inc.,\n30 F.3d 627, 630 (5th Cir. 1994) (same).\n\n                               B\n\n   Even if we could set aside this jurisdictional issue, the\nmajority should not have abandoned the long-standing proce-\ndural rules we have developed to maintain judicial restraint.\nFirst, it is hornbook law that “[w]e need not and do not con-\nsider a new contention that could have been but was not\nraised on the prior appeal.” Munoz v. Imperial Cnty., 667 F.2d\n811, 817 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Jimenez v. Franklin, 680\nF.3d 1096, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2012). As described above,\nHall could have challenged the district court’s June 2007\norder denying him leave to amend when he appealed that\ncourt’s first summary judgment order to a prior panel of this\ncourt. Because he “failed to do so,” he “cannot relitigate the\nissue here.” Jimenez, 680 F.3d at 1100.\n\n   Second, it is also well established that “[w]e will not ordi-\nnarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and\ndistinctly argued in appellant’s opening brief.” United States\nv. Ullah, 976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The majority concedes that such waiver\noccurred here, but it nevertheless considers Hall’s forfeited\nargument because the failure to consider it here would result\nin a manifest injustice and Hall’s failure to raise the issue\nproperly did not prejudice the City’s defense. See id.; Maj.\nOp. at 11755-57.\n\n   Both conclusions are incorrect. As a general matter, we\nhave reached unbriefed issues to avoid “manifest injustice”\nonly in criminal or deportation cases, where the deprivation\nof rights resulting from a waiver are most severe. All the\ncases cited by the majority to support its “manifest injustice”\nreasoning are consistent with this pattern. Maj. Op. at\n\f11768            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n11756-57. See, e.g., United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157,\n160 (1936) (noting that such “exceptional circumstances”\narise “especially in criminal cases”); Ullah, 976 F.2d at 514\n(“[I]t is ‘manifestly unjust’ to reverse the conviction of one\nco-defendant but to uphold the conviction of another co-\ndefendant when the same error affected both defendants.”).\nThe majority fails to point to a single case holding there was\n“manifest injustice” where the only thing at stake was the loss\nof civil damages, as is the case here.\n\n   The majority also errs in concluding that our consideration\nof Hall’s waived argument regarding amending his complaint\nwould not prejudice the City because it had fair notice of\nHall’s Fifth Amendment claim. Maj. Op. at 11757-58. While\nthis was certainly true when Hall attempted to amend his\ncomplaint in 2007, the district court denied such an amend-\nment and Hall chose not to appeal that denial. At that point,\nit was reasonable for the City to conclude that the Fifth\nAmendment claim was gone. Now, five years and two appeals\nlater, the majority both resurrects and resolves the question\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in denying\nHall’s motion to amend his complaint. As a result, the City is\non the losing end of an argument it never had a chance to\nrefute.\n\n                               C\n\n   Even if we overlooked our jurisdictional limits, turned back\nthe clock, and pretended that Hall had actually appealed the\ndistrict court’s denial of leave to amend, the majority is still\nwrong in reversing the district court. We have repeatedly held\nthat a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a\nmotion to amend a complaint “where the movant presents no\nnew facts but only new theories and provides no satisfactory\nexplanation for his failure to fully develop his contentions\noriginally.” Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir.\n1995); Allen v. City of Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 374 (9th\nCir. 1990); Vincent v. Trend W. Technical Corp., 828 F.2d\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES               11769\n563, 570-71 (9th Cir. 1987); Stein v. United Artists Corp., 691\nF.2d 885, 898 (9th Cir. 1982). That principle squarely governs\nthis case. Despite his disingenuous statement that he was “ad-\nding no new claim” to the proposed amended complaint,\nHall’s excerpts from the redline he attached to his motion to\namend show otherwise:\n\n    The individual defendants, while acting under color\n    of law, deprived plaintiff of his civil rights by violat-\n    ing his right under the Fourth Amendment to be free\n    from unreasonable seizures and his right under the\n    Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment to due process of\n    law in that they seized plaintiff or caused plaintiff to\n    be seized and imprisoned, for approximately 19\n    years, without a warrant or probable cause to believe\n    that he was involved in criminal activity, by\n    knowingly using false and fabricated evidence upon\n    which, including confessions extracted in violation\n    of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, to convict\n    plaintiff. . . .\n\n    “Plaintiff has a right to be free from unreasonable\n    seizures being a witness against himself, as pro-\n    tected by the Fourth Fifth Amendment . . . .”\n\n   These proposed changes demonstrate that the amended\ncomplaint merely substitutes a “new theory” (under the Fifth\nAmendment) for an old one (under the Fourth Amendment).\nGiven that, in the majority’s view, Hall’s original complaint\ngave rise to a “classic [Fifth Amendment] coerced confession\nclaim,” maj. op. at 11757, Hall has provided no explanation,\nmuch less a “satisfactory” one, for why it took him nearly two\nyears to make this change. See Allen, 911 F.2d at 374. The\ndistrict court’s determinations that Hall had failed to comply\nwith local rules, that there had been undue delay in amending\nthe complaint, and that such a delay prejudiced the City’s\ndefense are not “illogical, implausible, or without support in\ninferences that may be drawn from the record.” United States\n\f11770            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nv. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).\nAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\ndenying Hall leave to amend.\n\n                              III\n\n  As should be obvious by now, this case is not about apply-\ning the law to answer the questions raised, briefed, and argued\nby the parties. Rather, for the majority, this case is about a\n“confluence of events [ ] not fit for a just and fair society.”\nMaj. Op. at 11759. It is about “protect[ing] individuals against\narbitrary government action and abuse of power.” Maj. Op. at\n11759. And above all, it is about “prevent[ing] a woefully\nunjust result.” Maj. Op. at 11756. Thus, as the majority tells\nus, this is not “an ordinary case” involving a district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in a civil action, “but, rather, an\nextraordinary one.” Maj. Op. at 11759.\n\n   These equitable concerns carry the majority beyond what\nthe Constitution empowers us to do. Article III gives us the\nauthority to decide cases and controversies, provided to us\nthrough the “proper adversarial clash” between litigants.\nIngalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers’ Compen-\nsation Prog., Dep’t of Labor, 519 U.S. 248, 266 (1997). A\nfundamental premise of this adversarial system is “that appel-\nlate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry\nand research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions\npresented and argued by the parties before them.” NASA v.\nNelson, 131 S. Ct. 746, 756 n.10 (2011) (quoting Carducci v.\nRegan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.)).\n\n   These limitations are imposed on the judiciary to “ensure\nthat its desire to do good will not tempt it into abandoning its\nlimited role in our constitutional Government.” Missouri v.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 136 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring). By\nreaching beyond our jurisdiction and beyond the questions\n“presented and argued by the parties before” us, Nelson, 131\nS. Ct. at 756 n.10, the majority unwisely turns its back on\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES             11771\nthese fundamental principles of judicial restraint and in doing\nso, undermines the very principles of fairness and integrity it\npurports to advance.\n\n  I dissent.\n\f",

Hall appeals the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment to the City of Los Angeles and individual\ndefendants Mark Arneson and Kenneth Crocker (collectively,\n“Appellees”) in this action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. We conclude that the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment to Appellees on Hall’s fabrication-of-\nevidence claim, and we affirm on that basis. We reverse, how-\never, the district court’s denial of Hall’s motion to amend his\ncomplaint and remand to the district court with instructions to\nallow Hall to plead an explicit Fifth Amendment violation.\nThe exceptional circumstances in this case persuade us that a\nremand is necessary to avoid manifest injustice.\n\f11742            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nI.   Background\n\n   Some might call Hall an unlucky fellow. In October 1984,\nshortly after he turned 18, Hall witnessed a drive-by shooting\n(“the 54th Street shooting”). Ten people suffered gunshot\nwounds, five of whom died. Hall ended up with a broken nose\nin the ensuing melee.\n\n   The police persuaded Hall, who had no gang affiliation, to\ntestify in the 54th Street murder case. The State needed Hall\nto identify one of the triggermen, “Ace Capone,” an infamous\nmember of the Bloods gang. Hall’s cooperation with the\npolice put him in such serious danger that the police protected\nhis home every night for many months. Nevertheless, Hall\nfollowed through and testified at the preliminary hearing.\nMidway through his testimony, an attorney revealed Hall’s\nhome address. Hall abruptly left the stand, highly agitated and\nnervous. He had to be persuaded to finish testifying.\n\n  Following the preliminary hearing, the police continued to\nworry about Hall’s safety. Wayne Dufort, a detective on the\n54th Street case, wanted to keep Hall safe both for Hall’s own\nsake and to ensure his eyewitness testimony at trial. Dufort\nurged Hall to move a number of times, to no avail. Dufort\nalways was worried about Hall and thought that “there just\ndidn’t seem to be enough protection.”\n\n   Between the preliminary hearing and Hall’s arrest for rob-\nbery nine months later, Dufort visited Hall’s home regularly,\nsometimes daily. Dufort and Hall met in person about 200\ntimes during those months. These visits fostered a symbiotic\nfriendship of sorts between the two unlikely companions. In\naddition to being concerned for Hall’s safety, Dufort grew to\ncare for and like Hall during that time. The detective wanted\nto see Hall find a job, attain success and remain safe from any\nharm he risked by testifying in the 54th Street murder case.\nDufort even recommended Hall for a job and gave him a char-\nacter reference. For his part, Hall saw Dufort as a friend, and\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES             11743\nmaybe even as a father figure. Dufort gave Hall money,\nhelped him get a job and treated him with respect.\n\n   Meanwhile, someone murdered siblings Nola Duncan and\nDavid Rainey in June 1985 (“the Duncan-Rainey murders”).\nHall, who lived near the crime scene, gathered with other\ncurious neighbors to try to see what had happened. The close\nproximity of his home to where the police found Duncan’s\nbody appears to be Hall’s only connection, if one could call\nit that, to the crime.\n\n   The police had reason to believe that Theadry Art Powell,\nJr. committed the murders. Powell had a motive: Duncan sold\nPowell low-quality or doctored PCP hours before she died.\nWhen Powell discovered what Duncan had done, a witness\noverheard Powell exclaim, “I hate that bitch, go kill her!”\nbefore three men left Powell’s house. When questioned by\npolice, Powell initially claimed that he had not seen Duncan\nin three months, but later changed his story twice and admit-\nted he had seen her on the night she died. Powell ultimately\nimplicated two of his associates, Jerry Williams and Lonnie\nWardlow, suggesting that maybe one or both of them took\npart in Duncan’s murder. A polygrapher determined that both\nPowell and Wardlow falsely denied their involvement in Dun-\ncan’s killing. Despite these leads, the police did not investi-\ngate Powell, Williams or Wardlow as suspects in Duncan’s\nmurder.\n\n   The police arrested Hall for robbery in August 1985, six\nweeks after the Duncan-Rainey murders. Upon his arrest, Hall\nreached out to Dufort, seeking protection inside the jail from\ngang members who sought revenge for Hall’s testimony in the\n54th Street shooting case. Dufort arranged for Hall to be\nhoused with other informants. While his segregation from the\ngeneral population may have helped protect Hall from physi-\ncal attacks, he became a sitting duck for predatory informants.\nThree experienced jailhouse informants, with cases pending,\ndiscussed Duncan’s murder with Hall. Those informants then\n\f11744            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nfalsely implicated Hall in the Duncan-Rainey murders by con-\ncocting a story that Hall had confessed to the murders.\n\n   Detectives Arneson and Crocker, Appellees, worked on the\nDuncan-Rainey case and received information from these jail-\nhouse informants incriminating Hall. The first time Arneson\nand Crocker interviewed Hall, they asked him what he had\nheard about the Duncan-Rainey murders. Hall responded that\nhe “just heard some stuff” and that he was “just a witness.”\nThe officers did not read Hall his Miranda rights. The next\ninterview took place four days later and lasted about ten min-\nutes. Two days later, on September 11, 1985, Arneson called\nDufort. Arneson said that he planned to interview Hall and\ninsisted that Dufort be there, but would not say why. Dufort\ntried several times to avoid attending the interview because he\nwas too busy with other work, but ultimately agreed to meet\nArneson at the jail. Dufort arrived with his partner, Aaron\nMartin. They met with Arneson and Crocker, as well as with\ninformant Cornelius Lee. Lee identified Hall as the driver in\nthe 54th Street shooting, suggesting that Hall was not, in fact,\nan innocent witness as he had testified.\n\n   The police then interrogated Hall. First, Dufort and Martin\nquestioned Hall for several hours about the 54th Street shoot-\ning. Arneson and Crocker popped into the interview room to\nask if they could speak to Hall after Dufort and Martin were\nfinished. The police then moved Hall to a different booth\nwhere all four detectives questioned him about the Duncan-\nRainey murders. The detectives did not advise Hall of his\nMiranda rights. The detectives used a “we know more infor-\nmation than you think we know” technique in questioning\nhim.\n\n   The police asked Hall whether, before the murder, he was\nsmoking dope at a beauty shop with Duncan, whether he had\nsex with her and whether he had stabbed her. Hall denied\nstabbing Duncan or having anything to do with her murder,\nbut the police persisted. Arneson falsely claimed that the\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11745\npolice had found Hall’s semen in Duncan’s mouth and his fin-\ngerprints on her body. At this point, Hall became very afraid.\nHe asked for an attorney. Arneson asked Hall why he needed\nan attorney if he was innocent and said that the only people\nwho need attorneys are guilty and trying to hide something.\nArneson then told Hall that the police had found his footprint\nin the alley near Duncan’s body. Hall persisted in his denials.\n\n   Arneson then suggested that the police file charges against\nHall. Dufort warned Hall that if the police filed murder\ncharges against him and a jury convicted him, he would go to\nprison with Ace Capone, the Bloods gang member he testified\nagainst, and that Capone would kill him. Crocker added that,\nif Hall ended up in state prison, all the Bloods would be after\nhim for testifying against Capone and that all the Crips, the\nrival gang, would be after him for driving Capone to the 54th\nStreet shooting. Hall felt tired and hungry, but the detectives\nkept berating him. The police continued to reject Hall’s\nclaims that he had nothing to do with the murders.\n\n   Fear took over. Hall worried that if he did not confess, the\npolice would file murder charges. If he was convicted of mur-\nder, he would go to prison and be killed. He also worried that\nif he did not cooperate, the police would remove him from\nprotective housing and put him in the general population,\nwhere he would be in danger. Hall broke down and cried,\nhoping his display of emotion would inspire mercy. It did not.\n\n   Hall gave in to desperation, fear and fatigue. The police fed\nHall the “facts” about what happened the night of the Duncan-\nRainey murder. Hall either acquiesced to each statement or\nrepeated it back to Arneson. Hall both initialed next to mis-\ntakes in the statement Crocker had handwritten and signed the\nstatement at the bottom, as the police directed. He did not\nread the statement. This interrogation lasted somewhere\nbetween two and six hours, and the police did not afford Hall\nany food or bathroom breaks.\n\f11746             HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   After Arneson and Crocker left, Dufort and Martin contin-\nued to interrogate Hall about the 54th Street shooting case\nuntil the early morning. In all, Hall was questioned between\n17 and 19 hours that day. Hall was handcuffed during the\ninterrogations and denied food.\n\n   The State charged Hall with the murders of Duncan and\nRainey. No physical or forensic evidence connected Hall to\nthe murders. The sole evidence admitted at trial comprised\nHall’s confession and two documents provided by jailhouse\ninformant Lee—the same Lee who implicated Hall as the\ndriver in the 54th Street shooting. Lee had the cell next to\nHall. Lee and Hall had passed sheets of paper back and forth\nbetween their cells, with Lee sending over written questions\nand Hall sending back written responses. Hall’s answers, gen-\nerally innocuous taken by themselves, appeared to incriminate\nhim in the Duncan murder. Expert testimony at trial estab-\nlished that the handwriting on the notes belonged to both Hall\nand Lee. Many years after trial, Lee admitted that he had\nerased and re-written the questions after Hall answered them,\nmaking it look as though Hall had confessed to killing Dun-\ncan, when he had not in fact done so.\n\n   Hall was convicted of the Duncan-Rainey murders based\non the confession Crocker wrote and the falsified documents\nLee gave to the police. Hall spent nineteen years in prison.\nWe granted his habeas petition in 2004, upon determining that\nHall’s conviction was predicated on the documents Lee falsi-\nfied, resulting in a denial of due process.

Law of the Case and the Rule of Mandate\n\n  At the outset we must determine whether the law of the\ncase or the rule of mandate precluded the district court from\ndetermining the applicability of Devereaux prong (2) to Hall’s\ncoercive interrogation claim. They did not.\n\n   The law of the case doctrine, a judicial invention, aims to\npromote the efficient operation of the courts. Milgard Tem-\npering, Inc. v. Selas Corp. of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540888\"><a href=\"/opinion/540888/milgard-tempering-inc-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-selas/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715 (9th Cir.\n1990).

Lummi Indian\nTribe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771496\"><a href=\"/opinion/771496/united-states-of-america-and-lower-elwha-band-of-sklallams-jamestown-band/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452 (9th Cir. 2000). The issue in ques-\ntion must have been decided explicitly or by necessary impli-\ncation in the previous disposition. Id. Application of the\ndoctrine is discretionary. We therefore review the district\ncourt’s decision for abuse of discretion. See Milgard Temper-\ning, 902 F.2d at 715.\n\n   “The rule of mandate is similar to, but broader than, the law\nof the case doctrine.” United States v.

A district court that has received the mandate\nof an appellate court cannot vary or examine that mandate for\nany purpose other than executing it. Id. At the same time, the\nrule of mandate allows a lower court to decide anything not\nforeclosed by the mandate. Herrington v. County of Sonoma,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659394\"><a href=\"/opinion/659394/john-s-herrington-david-s-herrington-quail-hill-ranch-v-county-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).

CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11749\n   Here, the district court did not violate the law of the case.\nThe applicability of Devereaux prong (2) to Hall’s coercive\ninterrogation claim had never been considered or decided by\nany court. Our prior decision remanding to the district court\nstated only that the opinion granting Hall habeas relief did not\npreclude his § 1983 claim for a Devereaux prong (2) viola-\ntion. The decision did not then go on to analyze whether\nDevereaux prong (2) applied to Hall’s coercive interrogation\nclaim. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">15428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4-5.\n\n   Nor did the district court violate the rule of mandate, as it\nwas free to decide anything not foreclosed by the mandate.\nSee Herrington, 12 F.3d at 904. The mandate stated, “Because\nthe district court’s decision regarding collateral estoppel pre-\nvented the court and the parties from discovering and consid-\nering the evidence relating to Devereaux prong (2), we\nreverse the district court on its determination of prong (2).”\nHall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">15428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. We did not impose\nclear limits on the scope of the remand. See Mendez-\nGutierrez, 444 F.3d at 1172. Moreover, when a court is con-\nfronted with issues that the remanding court never considered,\nthe “mandate[ ] require[s] respect for what the higher court\ndecided, not for what it did not decide.” United States v. Kel-\nlington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769341\"><a href=\"/opinion/769341/united-states-v-daniel-f-kellington/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1093 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The\ndistrict court properly considered whether Hall’s coercive\ninterrogation claim fell within the purview of Devereaux\nprong (2).\n\n    2.   Cognizability of Coercive Interrogation Claim\n\n   Next we turn to the merits of the summary judgment\nmotion granted below. We must consider the district court’s\nconclusion that Hall could not proceed on the theory, pursuant\nto Devereaux prong (2), that his interrogation constituted fab-\nrication of evidence in violation of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. The district court did not err.\n\f11750            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   [1] “Section 1983 creates a private right of action against\nindividuals who, acting under color of state law, violate fed-\neral constitutional or statutory rights.” Devereaux, 263 F.3d at\n1074. Section 1983 “is not itself a source of substantive\nrights, but merely provides a method for vindicating federal\nrights elsewhere conferred.” Graham v. Connor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393-94 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). Thus, the nature of a Section 1983 action requires\nus to determine whether the right Hall identifies is in fact the\none that was allegedly infringed. See id. at 394.\n\n   [2] Hall asserts a Fourteenth Amendment due process\nclaim, predicated on Devereaux prong (2), that “there is a\nclearly established constitutional due process right not to be\nsubjected to criminal charges on the basis of false evidence\nthat was deliberately fabricated by the government.”\nDevereaux, 263 F.3d at 1074-75. We derived this right from\nthe Supreme Court’s holding in Pyle v. Kansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103727\"><a href=\"/opinion/103727/pyle-v-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n216 (1942), that “the knowing use by the prosecution of per-\njured testimony in order to secure a criminal conviction vio-\nlates the Constitution.” Devereaux, 263 F.3d at 1075. To\nsupport a Devereaux deliberate-fabrication-of-evidence claim,\na plaintiff:\n\n    must, at a minimum, point to evidence that supports\n    at least one of the following two propositions: (1)\n    Defendants continued their investigation of [plain-\n    tiff] despite the fact that they knew or should have\n    known that he was innocent; or (2) Defendants used\n    investigative techniques that were so coercive and\n    abusive that they knew or should have known that\n    those techniques would yield false information.\n\nId. at 1076. The only Devereaux issue before us relates to\nprong (2). See Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">15428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3-5.\nWe must determine whether Hall has put forth specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether\nArneson and Crocker used techniques so coercive and abusive\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES            11751\nin interrogating Hall that they knew or should have known\nthose techniques would generate false evidence. Devereaux,\n263 F.3d at 1076.\n\n   [3] But it is the Fifth Amendment, not the Fourteenth\nAmendment, that governs Hall’s claim. “Where a particular\nAmendment provides an explicit textual source of constitu-\ntional protection against a particular sort of government\nbehavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of\nsubstantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing such\na claim.” Albright v. Oliver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112924\"><a href=\"/opinion/112924/albright-v-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (1994) (inter-\nnal quotations and citations omitted). The Fifth Amendment\nprovides that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V.\nUsing a coerced confession against the accused in a criminal\nproceeding implicates this Fifth Amendment privilege. E.g.,\nCrowe v. County of San Diego, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148932\"><a href=\"/opinion/148932/crowe-v-county-of-san-diego/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427-29 (9th Cir.\n2010) (discussing Chavez v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127927\"><a href=\"/opinion/127927/chavez-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765\n(2003) (plurality). Here, Hall claims that the detectives\ncoerced his confession and then used that confession to secure\nhis conviction. Thus, the Fifth Amendment is the explicit con-\nstitutional provision that governs Hall’s claim.\n\n   [4] Hall has not brought a Fifth Amendment claim regard-\ning his confession, however. While Hall did seek to amend his\ncomplaint to add an explicit Fifth Amendment claim, Judge\nSchiavelli denied that motion. This is where Devereaux prong\n(2) comes into play. Most likely because Hall’s complaint\ndoes not include a Fifth Amendment claim, Hall alleges that\nAppellees violated his Fourteenth Amendment substantive\ndue process right not to suffer a conviction based on deliber-\nately fabricated evidence. He attempts mightily to make his\ncoerced confession claim fit within a fabrication-of-evidence\nframework. However artful this argument may be, it comes to\nnothing. As the district court held, Hall “cannot remedy his\ninadequate pleading now by repackaging a Fifth Amendment\ncoerced interrogation claim as one for deliberate fabrication\nof evidence arising under the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\f11752             HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   A survey of our caselaw confirms that Hall misses the mark\nwhen he construes his coerced-confession claim as properly\ncognizable under Devereaux prong (2). The facts in\nDevereaux concerned the investigation of alleged sex abuse\ninvolving lengthy and improper interviews of purported child\nvictims. 263 F.3d at 1073. These children did not endure\ncoerced interrogation techniques as suspects, but as third par-\nties. Moreover, in finding a right to be free from deliberately\nfabricated evidence in Devereaux, we relied in part on Pyle.\nThat case involved perjured testimony, also furnished by third\nparties. 317 U.S. at 214. In fact, all of our published cases that\nfollow Devereaux concern interview techniques used to elicit\nevidence from third-party witnesses, not the coerced interro-\ngation of a suspect. See, e.g., Stoot v. City of Everett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1346312\"><a href=\"/opinion/1346312/stoot-v-city-of-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 919 n.9 (9th Cir. 2009) (discussing claim that detective\ncoerced child victim); Gausvik v.

We have little choice but to affirm the grant of\nsummary judgment to Appellees. Because we affirm the con-\nclusion below that Devereaux prong (2) does not apply to\nHall’s coerced confession claim, we have no occasion to con-\nsider the district court’s holding that Hall did not create triable\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11753\nissues of fact in support of his deliberate fabrication-of-\nevidence claim.\n\n    3.    Qualified Immunity\n\n   The district court did not err in granting qualified immunity\nto Arneson and Crocker. They are entitled to qualified immu-\nnity unless (1) Hall has alleged facts that make out a violation\nof a constitutional right and (2) that constitutional right was\nclearly established at the time of the officers’ alleged miscon-\nduct.

The detectives therefore\nenjoy qualified immunity as to this claim, and we need not\naddress whether the right Hall asserts was clearly established\nat the time of his interrogation. See id. at 232-36.\n\n    4.

Fifth Amendment Coerced Confession Claim\n\n   [7] At oral argument, we asked the parties whether we\nhave the authority to remand this matter to the district court\nwith instructions to allow Hall to amend his complaint to\nallege an explicit Fifth Amendment coerced confession claim.\nWe also asked the parties whether, if we do in fact have the\n\f11754             HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nauthority to remand this case to the district court, we should\nexercise our discretion to do so. To give the parties a full and\nfair opportunity to address these questions, we also ordered\nsupplemental briefing.\n\n    1.   Jurisdiction\n\n  Before considering the propriety of remanding this matter,\nwe must ensure that we have appellate jurisdiction to consider\nsua sponte whether the district court erred in denying Hall’s\nrequest to amend the complaint to incorporate an explicit\nFifth Amendment claim. See Rowe v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">633</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">799</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (9th Cir. 1980).

A jury convicted\nHall of murder, a crime he did not commit, based only on his\nconfession and falsified documents manufactured by a jail-\nhouse informant. Hall served nineteen years in prison. Detec-\ntives interrogated an eighteen-year-old Hall for up to six\nhours, with no Miranda advisement. He was handcuffed and\ndenied food. When Hall asked for an attorney, Arneson asked\nwhy Hall needed an attorney if he did not commit the crime.\nArneson also told Hall that only guilty people who were try-\ning to hide something needed attorneys. Dufort, the detective\nHall had grown to see as a trusted friend and father figure,\ncautioned Hall that murder charges would lead to a convic-\ntion, which would land Hall in prison with Ace Capone and\nthat Capone would kill him. Crocker then added that Hall\nwould find himself in serious danger if he ended up in state\nprison because the Bloods would want revenge for his testi-\nmony in the 54th Street case, and the Crips would want\nrevenge for Hall driving Capone during the 54th Street shoot-\ning. Hall—weary, hungry and terrified for his life and safety\n—finally confessed to the crime with “facts” that Arneson\nspoon-fed him. Hall initialed and signed the statement, but he\nnever read it. The police interrogated Hall, handcuffed, for\nsomewhere between 17 and 19 hours that day.\n\n  [12] Certainly, on these facts, Hall’s § 1983 counsel should\nhave pled a Fifth Amendment coerced confession claim in the\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11757\ninitial complaint. That error turned out to be unfortunate and,\nwithout remand for amendment of the complaint, would prove\ndire to Hall’s case. But we cannot escape the fact that justice\neluded Hall during his highly suspect, and constitutionally\nquestionable, interrogation. Justice eluded Hall when he suf-\nfered a conviction based on that confession and the patently\nfalse inculpatory evidence created by a jailhouse informant.\nJustice eluded Hall when he served nineteen years in state\nprison for a crime he did not commit. And justice will elude\nHall yet again without the opportunity to amend his complaint\nand let a jury decide whether he deserves monetary compen-\nsation for his unlawful incarceration. If ever there were an\nexceptional case where we should exercise our discretionary\npower to avoid manifest injustice, we believe this must be it.\nSee United States v.

Prejudice to Appellees\n\n   [13] We find Appellees’ contention that they had no fair\nnotice of Hall’s Fifth Amendment claim curious, if not disin-\ngenuous. While Hall did not identify an explicit Fifth Amend-\nment claim, his 2005 complaint alleged facts that form the\nbasis of a classic coerced confession claim. Hall claimed that\nthe detectives (1) did not give him a Miranda admonition any\nof the times they interviewed or interrogated him, (2) told\nHall he would be murdered in prison if he did not confess and\n(3) subjected him to combined interrogations totaling 17 to 19\nhours. Moreover, we provided the parties the opportunity to\nbrief this issue. Alcaraz v.

On the record before us, we\ncannot conclude that amendment of the complaint would\ncause Appellees undue prejudice.\n\n    4.   Denial of Request to Amend\n\n   We now consider whether the district court erred in deny-\ning Hall’s motion to amend. We review the denial of a motion\nto amend for abuse of discretion. Jackson v.

The district court denied this request upon a finding\nthat Hall failed to meet and confer and that amendment would\nprejudice Appellees because of undue delay. District Court\nDocket Nos. 85 (citing United States ex rel. Schumer v.\nHughes Aircraft Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702518\"><a href=\"/opinion/702518/united-states-of-america-ex-rel-william-j-schumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1527 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(affirming denial of motion to amend where plaintiff waited\nthree years to amend, amendment would have required addi-\ntional discovery and plaintiff had amended the complaint once\nbefore)). The district court abused its discretion in prohibiting\namendment of the complaint.\n\n   [14] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that a\nparty may amend its pleading once as a matter of course\nwithin certain time limits, or, in all other instances, with the\ncourt’s leave. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Because the relevant time\nperiod had elapsed for an amendment as a matter of course,\nHall sought the court’s permission to amend. When a party\nrequests to amend a pleading, “[t]he court should freely give\nleave when justice so requires.” Id.; see also Wyshak v. City\nNat’l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370567\"><a href=\"/opinion/370567/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97118-robert-h-wyshak-v-city-national-bank-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826-27 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam)\n(finding no abuse of discretion where district court allowed\namendment of answer to assert statute of limitations because\nthe defense existed at the time plaintiff sued). “[T]his mandate\nis to be heeded.” Foman v.

CITY OF LOS ANGELES              11759\nplaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be\nafforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.” Id.\nMoreover, “[i]n the absence of any apparent or declared\nreason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on\nthe part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to the opposing\nparty by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of\namendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules\nrequire, be ‘freely given.’ ” Id.\n\n   [15] Here, the district court’s reliance on Hall’s failure to\nmeet and confer falls outside the supportable bases for deny-\ning a motion to amend. The district court also found that\namendment would prejudice Appellees because Hall waited\ntwo years from the filing of his initial complaint to add his\nFifth Amendment claim. As we have noted, however, the\ncomplaint gave Appellees fair notice of the facts supporting\nthe coerced interrogation claim. Moreover, it is questionable\nwhether amendment would have required additional discov-\nery, given the extensive discovery the parties had conducted\nalready.\n\n   An ordinary case in which counsel neglected to allege an\nobvious claim in a pleading would not warrant sua sponte\nconsideration of an issue, nor would we feel compelled to find\nan abuse of discretion. But we are not called to consider an\nordinary case, but, rather, an extraordinary one involving an\nunfortunate confluence of events—events not fit for a just and\nfair society. We are reminded today that as jurists we hold the\npower to protect individuals against arbitrary government\naction and abuse of power. See, e.g., Daniels v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111555\"><a href=\"/opinion/111555/daniels-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331 (1986). In remanding this matter to the district\ncourt, we intend to safeguard the fairness, integrity and repu-\ntation of our courts, by making justice possible for Hall. See\nAtkinson, 297 U.S. at 160.\n\nIV.   Conclusion\n\n   [16] We affirm the grant of summary judgment to Appel-\nlees on Hall’s fabrication of evidence claim. We reverse the\n\f11760            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\ndenial of Hall’s motion for leave to amend his complaint and\nremand to the district court to allow Hall to allege an explicit\ncoercive interrogation claim pursuant to the Fifth Amend-\nment.\n\n AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in                            part,\nREMANDED. Each side shall bear its own costs.\n\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Not content with our task, prescribed by Article III, of\ndeciding the controversies raised by the parties, the majority\nhas decided to ask and answer its own legal questions instead.\nAt oral argument, the majority sua sponte raised the possibil-\nity that instead of addressing Harold Hall’s sole argument on\nappeal that the district court had erred in rejecting his Four-\nteenth Amendment claim, we could revive and address an\nunrelated and unappealed procedural issue: whether, over five\nyears earlier, the district court had erred in denying Hall’s\nmotion to amend his complaint to add a new Fifth Amend-\nment claim.\n\n   Today, the majority takes itself up on that offer. It begins\nby creating a novel legal argument for Hall and then, having\nconcluded that its own argument has merit, it proceeds to\nresolve the case on those grounds. Maj. Op. at III.B. In doing\nso, the majority disregards the most basic principles of judi-\ncial restraint, erroneously overturns a district court decision\nthat we have no jurisdiction to review, and gives Hall relief\nthat he never asked us to give. While the majority claims that\nthese imprudent steps are necessary to “safeguard the fairness,\nintegrity and reputation of our courts,” maj. op. at 11759, I\nfear that they will have the exact opposite effect. I dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n   Because the majority’s impassioned retelling of Hall’s\nstory is economical with the procedural facts relevant to this\nappeal, I will begin by outlining them here.\n\f                     HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES                    11761\n                                     A\n\n   In 2003, a split panel of this court granted Hall’s habeas\npetition on the grounds that “false and material evidence was\nadmitted at Hall’s trial in violation of his due process rights,”\nand the state court’s contrary ruling was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. Hall v. Dir. of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783568\"><a href=\"/opinion/783568/harold-coleman-hall-v-director-of-corrections-california-state-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 985 (9th Cir. 2003) (Hall I). Hall I rejected Hall’s\nother constitutional claims, including his Fifth Amendment\nclaims for violation of his Miranda rights and right against\nself-incrimination, stating “[w]e have examined the record\nand find that these claims are without merit.” Id. at 981 n.5.\n\n  In March 2005, Hall brought suit for money damages under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Los Angeles, the Los\nAngeles Police Department, and various police officers\ninvolved in his prosecution. He alleged claims for relief based\non his unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment\nand the use of false evidence against him at trial in violation\nof his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.\n\n  Some two years later, in May 2007, after the close of dis-\ncovery and less than five months before the scheduled trial,\nHall moved to amend his complaint. The proposed amended\ncomplaint dropped Hall’s Fourth Amendment claim, which\nhad become time-barred in light of a recent Supreme Court\ncase, and added an entirely new claim for violation of his\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.1\n  1\n   Hall’s motion to amend asserts that “plaintiff is adding no new claim”\nto the amended complaint, but this assertion is belied by the amended\ncomplaint itself (attached to the motion), which provides a redlined com-\nparison with the original complaint. For example, paragraph 37 of the\namended complaint begins:\n      Plaintiff has a right to be free from unreasonable seizures being\n      a witness against himself, as protected by the Fourth Fifth\n      Amendment. . . .”\n\f11762            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n   The City objected to the proposed amendment. First, the\nCity asserted that, contrary to his declaration, Hall had failed\nto follow local rules requiring the parties to meet and confer\nprior to the filing of any motion to amend. See C.D. Cal.\nLocal Rule 7-3. Second, according to the City, Hall had\nunduly delayed his attempt to amend the complaint: he knew\nall the facts underlying his Fifth Amendment claim when he\noriginally filed suit in March 2005, yet he unreasonably\nwaited over two years to add that new claim. Further, the City\ncontended, this amendment would be prejudicial because it\nwould require the City to prepare for an entirely new constitu-\ntional claim with only months to go before trial and without\nthe benefit of additional discovery. The district court agreed,\nholding that Hall had failed to comply with the requirement\nto meet and confer, and also that his undue delay in amending\nhis complaint would be prejudicial to the City. Accordingly,\non June 19, 2007, it denied Hall’s motion for leave to amend\nhis complaint.\n\n   The City then filed a motion for summary judgment on\nHall’s one remaining claim: that the City’s police officers vio-\nlated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by using\ninterrogation techniques so coercive that they knew the inter-\nrogation would generate false evidence. The district court\ngranted summary judgment to the City on this claim, partly\nbecause it concluded that Hall I’s determination that Hall’s\nself-incrimination claim was “without merit,” Hall I, 343 F.3d\nat 981 n.5, had a preclusive effect on Hall’s Fourteenth\nAmendment false evidence claim, which also focused on the\npolice officers’ allegedly coercive interrogation tactics.\n\n   In December 2007, Hall filed a notice of appeal stating his\nintent to appeal the district court’s order granting the City’s\nsummary judgment motion. Neither the notice of appeal nor\nHall’s appellate briefing made any mention of the district\ncourt’s June 2007 denial of his motion to amend his com-\nplaint. Instead, Hall challenged the district court’s determina-\ntion that Hall I precluded his Fourteenth Amendment claim,\n\f                 HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES               11763\nand reiterated his argument that his Fourteenth Amendment\nright to be free from prosecution based on false evidence had\nbeen violated. In July 2009, a different panel of this court\nreversed the district court’s conclusion that Hall I had a pre-\nclusive effect, and remanded for further consideration of\nHall’s Fourteenth Amendment false evidence claim. Hall v.\nCity of Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2020851</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2009) (Hall\nII).\n\n   On remand, the district court again granted summary judg-\nment to the City. First, the court held that Hall’s claim was\nnot cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment, but should\nhave been raised as a violation of his Fifth Amendment right\nagainst self-incrimination. Second, the district court ruled that\neven if Hall’s claim was cognizable under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, there was no genuine issue of material fact that\nthe City’s police officers had generated false evidence. Hall\nfiled a notice of appeal challenging the district court’s order\ngranting the City summary judgment.\n\n                               B\n\n   This second appeal is now before us. As in his first appeal,\nHall advances no argument that the district court erred in June\n2007 when it denied his motion to add a Fifth Amendment\nclaim to his complaint. In fact, the gist of Hall’s argument is\nthat the district court erred in holding that his claim was cog-\nnizable only under the Fifth Amendment for the simple reason\nthat he was not bringing a Fifth Amendment claim. Rather, he\nwas bringing a broader Fourteenth Amendment claim that the\nofficers “fabricated the evidence (including but not limited to\nthe false confession)” that was used to prosecute him. The\nCity’s briefing responds to Hall’s Fourteenth Amendment\narguments.\n\n   Thus, on appeal, we should address the question Hall actu-\nally raised: whether his Fourteenth Amendment false evi-\ndence claim survives summary judgment. Hall relies on our\n\f11764               HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\nen banc decision in Devereaux v.

But, as the majority explains, we\nhave never applied Devereaux’s prohibition against the fabri-\ncation of evidence to adjudicate claims involving the coercive\ninterrogation of a suspect. Maj.

See Albright, 510 U.S.\nat 273. Because Hall has not brought a Fifth Amendment\nclaim, we must affirm the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the City on Hall’s Fourteenth Amendment claim.2\nThe majority agrees with this Fourteenth Amendment analysis\nand thus, it correctly affirms the district court’s grant of sum-\nmary judgment to the City on Hall’s Fourteenth Amendment\nclaims. That ruling should end this case. It is all that the par-\nties asked us to decide.\n\n                                   II\n\n   But that is not all the majority wants to decide. After reject-\ning Hall’s argument as a failed “repackaging [of] a Fifth\nAmendment coerced interrogation claim as one for deliberate\nfabrication of evidence arising under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment,” maj. op. at 11751, the majority then proceeds sua\nsponte to offer Hall a different, unasked for, package of relief:\na second chance to add a Fifth Amendment claim to his com-\n  2\n   For similar reasons, we must also affirm the district court’s grant of\nqualified immunity to the City’s police officers.\n\f                     HALL v.

To do so, the majority posits an appeal\n(one not actually brought by Hall) from the district court’s\nJune 2007 order denying Hall’s motion to amend his com-\nplaint; asserts appellate jurisdiction over this theoretical\nappeal; posits an argument (one not actually raised by Hall)\nfor why the district court abused its discretion by denying\nHall’s motion to amend his complaint; and relies on that argu-\nment to conclude that the district court did abuse its discre-\ntion.

Here, we are\nsimply without authority to review this “appeal” of the district\ncourt’s long-forgotten denial of Hall’s motion to amend.

Maj. Op. at 11754. While the major-\nity is correct in explaining when an interlocutory order satis-\nfies the finality requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1291, the\nmajority ignores the separate jurisdictional bar provided by\nRule 3. Even if an interlocutory order becomes sufficiently\nfinal by merging with a later final judgment, the appellant\nmust still identify the prior order in the notice of appeal or\ndiscuss it in its appellate briefing in order to demonstrate\nsome intent to appeal it.

That was not\ndone here.4 Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider the\ndistrict court’s June 2007 order denying Hall leave to amend\nhis complaint to add a Fifth Amendment claim. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v.

But liberally applying\na jurisdictional requirement is not the same as eliminating it, which the\nmajority has effectively done here. See Smith, 502 U.S. at 248 (“This prin-\nciple of liberal construction does not, however, excuse noncompliance\nwith [Rule 3].”); Torres, 487 U.S. at 315-16 (“Permitting imperfect but\nsubstantial compliance with a technical requirement is not the same as\nwaiving the requirement altogether as a jurisdictional threshold.”).\n\f                 HALL v.

Imperial Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398308\"><a href=\"/opinion/398308/guillermo-gallego-munoz-v-county-of-imperial/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Jimenez v.

As described above,\nHall could have challenged the district court’s June 2007\norder denying him leave to amend when he appealed that\ncourt’s first summary judgment order to a prior panel of this\ncourt. Because he “failed to do so,” he “cannot relitigate the\nissue here.” Jimenez, 680 F.3d at 1100.\n\n   Second, it is also well established that “[w]e will not ordi-\nnarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and\ndistinctly argued in appellant’s opening brief.” United States\nv. Ullah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591454\"><a href=\"/opinion/591454/united-states-v-sakhawat-ullah-jr-united-states-of-america-v-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The majority concedes that such waiver\noccurred here, but it nevertheless considers Hall’s forfeited\nargument because the failure to consider it here would result\nin a manifest injustice and Hall’s failure to raise the issue\nproperly did not prejudice the City’s defense. See id.; Maj.\nOp. at 11755-57.\n\n   Both conclusions are incorrect. As a general matter, we\nhave reached unbriefed issues to avoid “manifest injustice”\nonly in criminal or deportation cases, where the deprivation\nof rights resulting from a waiver are most severe. All the\ncases cited by the majority to support its “manifest injustice”\nreasoning are consistent with this pattern. Maj. Op. at\n\f11768            HALL v. CITY OF LOS ANGELES\n11756-57. See, e.g., United States v. Atkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102591\"><a href=\"/opinion/102591/united-states-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n160 (1936) (noting that such “exceptional circumstances”\narise “especially in criminal cases”); Ullah, 976 F.2d at 514\n(“[I]t is ‘manifestly unjust’ to reverse the conviction of one\nco-defendant but to uphold the conviction of another co-\ndefendant when the same error affected both defendants.”).\nThe majority fails to point to a single case holding there was\n“manifest injustice” where the only thing at stake was the loss\nof civil damages, as is the case here.\n\n   The majority also errs in concluding that our consideration\nof Hall’s waived argument regarding amending his complaint\nwould not prejudice the City because it had fair notice of\nHall’s Fifth Amendment claim. Maj. Op. at 11757-58. While\nthis was certainly true when Hall attempted to amend his\ncomplaint in 2007, the district court denied such an amend-\nment and Hall chose not to appeal that denial. At that point,\nit was reasonable for the City to conclude that the Fifth\nAmendment claim was gone. Now, five years and two appeals\nlater, the majority both resurrects and resolves the question\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in denying\nHall’s motion to amend his complaint. As a result, the City is\non the losing end of an argument it never had a chance to\nrefute.\n\n                               C\n\n   Even if we overlooked our jurisdictional limits, turned back\nthe clock, and pretended that Hall had actually appealed the\ndistrict court’s denial of leave to amend, the majority is still\nwrong in reversing the district court. We have repeatedly held\nthat a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a\nmotion to amend a complaint “where the movant presents no\nnew facts but only new theories and provides no satisfactory\nexplanation for his failure to fully develop his contentions\noriginally.” Bonin v.

That principle squarely governs\nthis case. Despite his disingenuous statement that he was “ad-\nding no new claim” to the proposed amended complaint,\nHall’s excerpts from the redline he attached to his motion to\namend show otherwise:\n\n    The individual defendants, while acting under color\n    of law, deprived plaintiff of his civil rights by violat-\n    ing his right under the Fourth Amendment to be free\n    from unreasonable seizures and his right under the\n    Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment to due process of\n    law in that they seized plaintiff or caused plaintiff to\n    be seized and imprisoned, for approximately 19\n    years, without a warrant or probable cause to believe\n    that he was involved in criminal activity, by\n    knowingly using false and fabricated evidence upon\n    which, including confessions extracted in violation\n    of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, to convict\n    plaintiff. . . .\n\n    “Plaintiff has a right to be free from unreasonable\n    seizures being a witness against himself, as pro-\n    tected by the Fourth Fifth Amendment . . . .”\n\n   These proposed changes demonstrate that the amended\ncomplaint merely substitutes a “new theory” (under the Fifth\nAmendment) for an old one (under the Fourth Amendment).\nGiven that, in the majority’s view, Hall’s original complaint\ngave rise to a “classic [Fifth Amendment] coerced confession\nclaim,” maj. op. at 11757, Hall has provided no explanation,\nmuch less a “satisfactory” one, for why it took him nearly two\nyears to make this change. See Allen, 911 F.2d at 374. The\ndistrict court’s determinations that Hall had failed to comply\nwith local rules, that there had been undue delay in amending\nthe complaint, and that such a delay prejudiced the City’s\ndefense are not “illogical, implausible, or without support in\ninferences that may be drawn from the record.” United States\n\f11770            HALL v.

Rather, for the majority, this case is about a\n“confluence of events [ ] not fit for a just and fair society.”\nMaj. Op. at 11759. It is about “protect[ing] individuals against\narbitrary government action and abuse of power.” Maj. Op. at\n11759. And above all, it is about “prevent[ing] a woefully\nunjust result.” Maj. Op. at 11756. Thus, as the majority tells\nus, this is not “an ordinary case” involving a district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in a civil action, “but, rather, an\nextraordinary one.” Maj. Op. at 11759.\n\n   These equitable concerns carry the majority beyond what\nthe Constitution empowers us to do.
