Pharr and County units\n                                   were not involved in or nearby at the time of the\n                                   collision. This is an interlocutory appeal of the\n                                   denial of a Plea to the Jurisdiction filed by Hidalgo\n                                   County as a governmental entity. The legal question\n                                   at issue is whether Hidalgo County retains\n                                   governmental immunity from Plaintiffs’ claims for\n                                   personal injuries and wrongful death. Defendant\n                                   Hidalgo County contends that Plaintiffs have not\n                                   pleaded and have not filed competent prima facie\n                                   evidence of a claim which overcomes governmental\n                                   immunity or which fits within a waiver exception\n                                   thereto. In short, the trial Court has no jurisdiction\n                                   over Plaintiffs’ claim, as pleaded and proved herein.\n\nCourse of Proceedings:             Plaintiffs filed suit against Hidalgo County, Texas\n                                   and other governmental entities on May 23, 2012.\n                                   1CR201.

On\n                             September 26, 2013, the Court heard Defendant\n                             County’s Second amended Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n                             2RR1.

On May 20, 2014,\n                             Plaintiffs filed a Response to Defendant County’s\n                             Motion to Exclude. 1CR285. On May 21, 2014,\n                             Hidalgo County filed an First Amended Reply to\n                             Plaintiffs’ Response to Its First And Second\n                             Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction. 1CR371. On May\n                             21, 2014, the Court heard Defendant County’s\n                             Second Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction and its\n                             Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs’ Expert Report. 3RR1.\n                             Thereafter, on the same date, Defendant County\n                             filed a Letter Brief to the Court. 1CR377. On\n                             March 13, 2015, the Court denied Defendant\n                             County’s First and Second Amended Plea to the\n                             Jurisdiction. 1CR405. Defendant County filed its\n                             Notice of Appeal on March 31, 2015. 1CR406.\n\nTrial Court’s Disposition:   On March 13, 2015, the trial court denied Defendant\n                             County’s Plea to the Jurisdiction. 1CR405. The trial\n                             court has never ruled on Defendant County’s\n                             Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs’ Expert Report.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xi\n\f                       STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      Defendant Hidalgo County challenges the jurisdiction of the trial court as set\n\nout herein. This court has appellate jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n\n§51.014(a)(8) Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code, which allows interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom the denial of a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit.\n\n              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellants request oral argument in order to elaborate on the issues\n\npresented and answer questions of the Court, based on the complexity of the facts.\n\nThe record is somewhat complicated and oral argument would assist the Court in\n\nfocusing on the facts and relevant issues.\n\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    The Trial Court Erred in Denying Defendant Hidalgo County’s Plea to\n      the Jurisdiction because Plaintiffs Have Neither Alleged Nor Proven\n      and Cannot Allege or Prove an Affirmative Waiver of Hidalgo\n      County’s Sovereign Immunity.\n\n2.    Hidalgo County is Not Liable Because Deputy Ortega Did Not Breach\n      the Emergency Standard of Care.\n\n3.    Hidalgo County Is Not Liable Because Deputy Ortega Was Acting\n      Within the Scope of His Authority and In Good Faith.\n\n4.    The Report of \"Expert\" Weinblatt Is Not Based Upon a Reliable\n      Foundation  and   Must   Be    Regarded    as  No   Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f                                STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a negligence action under the Texas Tort Claims Act2 against\n\nHidalgo County, Texas (and other law enforcement agencies), alleging damages\n\narising from a fatal collision between vehicles being driven by Rafael Carro\n\nQuintero and Plaintiffs’ deceased family member, Reynaldo Herrera. 1CR137-141,\n\n143-147. Quintero was the driver of a black Ford Expedition who was fleeing\n\nfrom a pursuit through multiple jurisdictions initiated by a City of Pharr Police\n\nOfficer. CR139.\n\n       At approximately 6:00 p.m. on May 26, 2010, City of Pharr Police Officer\n\nEmilio Gonzalez had attempted to stop the black Expedition being driven by\n\nQuintero on a traffic violation. 1CR138. Officer Gonzalez reported to his\n\ndispatcher that the vehicle had come out of a high drug traffic area, but did not tell\n\nhis dispatcher that he was pursuing the vehicle because of a window tint violation.\n\n1CR138; 2CR43, 45. At a high rate of speed, Quintero fled from Officer Gonzalez,\n\nwho pursued him eastbound on Military Road and through the City of Alamo.\n\n1CR139. During the pursuit, Officer Gonzalez radioed for assistance from other\n\nlaw enforcement agencies, including the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Department.\n\n1CR139, 140.\n\n2\n  Plaintiffs erroneously plead that their causes of action arise under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n101.102. 1CR137. This Section of the Tort Claims Act only sets out the pleading and service\nrequirements for the commencement of a suit.\n\n                                                 1\n\f      At approximately 6:16 p.m., Hidalgo County Senior Deputy John Ortega\n\nwas parked west of the intersection of Tower and Canton Roads in Edinburg,\n\nHidalgo County. He heard the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office communications\n\ndispatcher radio that Pharr Police Department was in pursuit of a black Ford\n\nExpedition travelling northbound from F.M. 495 on Tower Road and that it was\n\npossibly transporting narcotics. 1CR85; App.Tab.5. Sgt. Miguel Davila of Hidalgo\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Office also heard the Sheriff’s Office dispatcher relay the City of\n\nPharr request for assistance and that the vehicle was transporting narcotics. 1CR95.\n\nDeputy Ortega then repositioned and parked his unit facing south, on Tower Road\n\nsouth of Canton Road. He observed that at a distance south on Tower Road, red\n\nand blue emergency lights and wig wags of the vehicles involved in the pursuit\n\nwere visible. 1CR85; App.Tab.5. He then observed the black Expedition with\n\nMexico license plates traveling north on Tower Road at a very high rate of speed.\n\n1CR85-86; App.Tab.5. He activated his own emergency lights and siren to identify\n\nhimself to the fleeing vehicle as a Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office unit and\n\nSheriff’s deputy. The fleeing vehicle continued past him, traveling north at a very\n\nhigh rate of speed. 1CR86; App. Tab.5. Sometime thereafter, Pharr Police Officer\n\nGonzalez disengaged the pursuit at the intersection of Tower and Trenton Roads,\n\nbut failed to radio to advise other agencies to disengage. 1CR140, 1CR96;\n\nApp.Tab.7.\n\n\n                                         2\n\fAfter making a u-turn at Canton Road, Deputy Ortega observed the fleeing vehicle\n\nalready passing Iowa Road, one half-mile north of Canton Road. 1CR85-86;\n\n1CR88; App.Tab.5.      By the time Deputy Ortega reached Iowa Road, the\n\nExpedition had turned westbound onto Curve Road, 7/10ths of a mile north of\n\nDeputy Ortega’s location. 1CR86; App.Tab.5; 1CR89; App.Tab.6. When Deputy\n\nOrtega reached the intersection of Tower Road and Curve Road he made a\n\ncomplete stop. He then turned and headed west towards Alamo Road; he had no\n\nsight of the vehicle but followed a cloud of dust. 1CR86; App.Tab.5. Curve Road\n\nis a dirt road. 1CR96 App.Tab.7. Concerned that the dust prevented him from\n\nbeing able to see oncoming traffic and because of the rough road surface and\n\npotholes, Deputy Ortega drove slowly from Tower Road to Alamo Road on Curve\n\nRoad.   Demonstrating a further concern for the safety of others, he made a\n\ncomplete stop where Curve Road intersects with Alamo Road to observe north and\n\nsouth bound traffic. There, he observed a white Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office\n\nExpedition approach from the south. 1CR86; App.Tab.5. As Deputy Javier Lopez\n\n(in the white Expedition) drove north on Alamo Road, he had heard Deputy Ortega\n\nreport that the black Expedition was traveling toward Alamo Road on Curve Road.\n\n1CR96; App.Tab.7. As he drove toward the intersection of Curve Road and Alamo\n\nRoad, Deputy Lopez did not see the black Expedition cross the intersection, but\n\nsaw a dust cloud at the intersection. Then, Deputy Lopez observed Deputy Ortega\n\n\n                                       3\n\fcautiously cross Alamo Road. 1CR96; App.Tab.7. 2CR J. Lopez Video at 2:01.\n\nAfter crossing the intersection, Deputy Ortega continued to travel westbound on\n\nCurve Road and Deputy Javier Lopez turned onto Curve Road and followed him.\n\n1CR86; App.Tab.5. 2CR J. Lopez Video at 2:01. Neither Deputy Ortega nor\n\nDeputy Lopez had sight of the black Expedition as they proceeded west on Curve\n\nRoad until they arrived at the intersection of Curve Road and Cesar Chavez Road\n\nand saw that it had been involved in a major traffic accident. 1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\nThe two Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office units driven by Deputy Ortega and\n\nDeputy Lopez arrived at the scene of the collision two to three minutes after it\n\noccurred. 1CR98; App.Tab.9; 1CR102-103; App.Tab.8; 1CR267-272; App.Tabs.8,\n\n9.\n\n      Thus, Deputy Ortega was not directly engaged in the vehicle pursuit after he\n\nlost sight of the black Expedition when it turned onto Curve Road. 1CR96. When\n\nSgt. Miguel Davila, Deputy Ortega’s supervisor reviewed Deputy Ortega’s\n\ndashcam video he determined that it had not recorded any data that day. The last\n\nrecorded data was the evening before on May 25, 2010 at 8:53 p.m. 1CR96;\n\nApp.Tab.7.\n\n      The driver of the fleeing black Expedition was transporting persons who had\n\ncrossed the river from Mexico into the United States that afternoon. 1CR91;\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fApp.Tab. 11. Following the collision several persons ran from the black\n\nExpedition. Six persons were detained following the collision. 1CR95; App.Tab.7.\n\n      The front seat passenger being transported in the black Expedition stated that\n\nafter the vehicle entered the dirt road, she could no longer see police lights or hear\n\nsirens. 1CR91; App.Tab 11. A passenger in the middle of the second row of seats\n\n(who had been told to keep his head down) stated that sometime prior to the\n\ncollision he could no longer hear the sirens. 1CR92; App.Tab.12.\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Plaintiffs have not as a matter of law pleaded a cause of action in this case or\n\npresented evidence which overcomes Hidalgo County’s sovereign immunity under\n\nthe Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code 101.021(2), because\n\nthere is no use of a motor vehicle by Hidalgo County that caused the collision\n\nbetween the third party and the Plaintiff’s vehicle in this case. The only evidence\n\non the issue of causation is that the County vehicle was 2-3 minutes away when the\n\ncollision occurred and was not within sight or hearing. Accordingly, there was\n\nsuch a physical and temporal separation between the County vehicle and the\n\ncollision in question, that no causal nexus exists as a matter of law.\n\n      Further, the County Deputy involved was acting under an “emergency” and\n\nclearly did not breach the standard applicable to such situation; he was not\n\nreckless; and the only evidence of his conduct demonstrates care and caution, as\n\n\n                                           5\n\fopposed to the “conscious indifference” and “reckless disregard” required for\n\nliability under the law.\n\n      Additionally, Deputy Ortega was acting in good faith, within the scope of\n\nhis authority, and was acting well within his discretionary immunity at all times.\n\n      No competent evidence exists that no reasonably prudent officer under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances could have believed that Deputy Ortega should have\n\nresponded differently and should not have followed the fleeing suspect in the\n\nmanner in which he did. The only evidence offered by the Plaintiffs is that of the\n\npolice procedure “expert” who is not qualified to render opinions on causation or\n\naccident reconstruction, and whose opinions relative to Deputy Ortega are\n\nconclusory, unreliable and unsupported by a factual foundation.\n\n      Consequently, the trial court erred in its denial of the Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\nand the case should be reversed and rendered in favor of Hidalgo County.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\n1.    The Trial Court Erred in Denying Defendant Hidalgo County’s Plea to\n      the Jurisdiction because Plaintiffs Have Neither Alleged Nor Proven\n      and Cannot Allege or Prove an Affirmative Waiver of Hidalgo\n      County’s Sovereign Immunity.\n\n      A plaintiff bears the burden of alleging facts affirmatively showing that the\n\ntrial court has subject matter jurisdiction. City of Pharr v. Aguillon, No. 13-09-\n\n00011-CV, 2010 WL 1138449 *2 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi March 25, 2010, no\n\npet.)(mem. op., not designated for publication) citing Texas Ass’n of Business v.\n                                          6\n\fTexas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993); Dallas Area Rapid\n\nTransit v. Whitley, 104 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex. 2003); see also Texas Dep’t of\n\nCriminal Justice v. Miller, 51 S.W.3d 583, 587 (Tex. 2001).\n\n        Whether a trial court has jurisdiction is a question of law. Mayhew v. Town\n\nof Sunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922, 928 (Tex. 1998). Sovereign immunity deprives a\n\ntrial court of subject matter jurisdiction for lawsuits in which the state or certain\n\ngovernmental units have been sued, unless the Tort Claims Act expressly waives\n\nimmunity. Texas Dept. of Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 224-\n\n225 (Tex. 2004).\n\n        To determine if a plaintiff has met his burden to prove subject matter\n\njurisdiction and a waiver of sovereign immunity, the Court may consider the facts\n\nalleged by the plaintiff and must consider evidence in the record when necessary to\n\nresolve the jurisdictional issue. City of Pharr, 2010 WL 1138449 *2, citing Bland\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000); see also Miranda at\n\n227).\n\n        Hidalgo County is a political subdivision and is therefore a governmental\n\nunit of the State of Texas. See, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3)(B).\n\nSovereign immunity includes two distinct principles, immunity from suit and\n\nimmunity from liability. Miranda at 224. Immunity from liability is an affirmative\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\fdefense and immunity from suit deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nId.\n\n      The Texas Tort Claims Act provides a limited waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity. Id.; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 101.001-101.109. The Act creates\n\na unique statutory scheme in which the two immunities are co-extensive:\n\n“Sovereign immunity to suit is waived and abolished to the extent of liability\n\ncreated by this chapter.” Miranda at 224, citing Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n101.025(a); State ex rel. State Dep’t of Highways & Pub. Transp. v. Gonzalez, 82\n\nS.W.3d 322, 326 (Tex. 2002). Accordingly, Hidalgo County is immune from suit\n\nunless the Tort Claims Act expressly waives immunity.\n\n      Hidalgo County’s sovereign immunity is not expressly waived under either\n\nor all of the sections of the Tort Claims Act relevant to this case. Tex. Civ. Prac. &\n\nRem. Code §101.021 (because there is no use of a motor vehicle); and Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code §101.055(2) (emergency response or situation). Further,\n\nHidalgo County’s immunity is preserved under the official immunity which\n\nprotects Deputy Ortega. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §101.021(1). See, City of\n\nHouston v. Kilburn, 849 S.W.2d 810, 812 (Tex. 1993, per curiam).\n\n      In a suit against a governmental unit, the plaintiff must affirmatively\n\ndemonstrate the court’s jurisdiction by alleging a valid waiver of immunity Whitley\n\nat 542. Plaintiffs have failed to plead a waiver of the Texas Tort Claims Act\n\n\n                                          8\n\fagainst Hidalgo County under Section 101.021, although they did plead a waiver\n\nunder Section 101.055(2) (emergency response or situation). 1CR142. Plaintiffs\n\nhave also asserted that the employees, officers and agents of Hidalgo County are\n\nnot entitled to official immunity. 1CR143.\n\n      Section 101.021 of the Texas Tort Claims Act provides the following limited\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, stating that a governmental unit is liable (and may\n\nbe sued) for:\n\n        (1) Property damage, personal injury, and death proximately caused by the\nwrongful act or omission or the negligence of an employee acting within the scope\nof his employment if:\n\n            (A) The property damage, personal injury, or death arises from the\n      operation or use of a motor-driven vehicle or motor-driven equipment; and\n\n            (B) The employee would be personally liable to the claimant\n      according to Texas law; or\n\n       (2) personal injury and death so caused by a condition or use of tangible\npersonal or real property if the governmental unit would, were it a private person,\nbe liable to claimant according to Texas law.\n\n      For immunity to be waived under this section, the government employee\n\nmust be the person who operated or used the motor vehicle that caused the injury.\n\nHamshire-Fannett Indep. Sch. Dist. v. LeLeaux, 835 S.W.2d 49, 51 (Tex. 1992);\n\n“This requirement is consistent with the clear intent of the Act that the waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity be limited.” LeLeaux, 835 S.W.2d at 51.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f      Rather than the negligence standard of care set out in Section 101.021,\n\nPlaintiffs cite to the higher duty of care owed by the operator of an authorized\n\nemergency vehicle under Section 546.005 of the Texas Transportation Code to\n\nsupport their claims.\n\n      Sections 546.001, et. seq. of the Code provide, in part, that under limited\n\ncircumstances, the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle may disregard\n\ncertain traffic laws when responding to an emergency call, or when pursuing an\n\nactual or suspected violator of the law. Tex. Transp. Code §§ 546.001, 546.002,\n\n546.003. Section 546.005 of the Code sets out the duty of care owed under this\n\nchapter:\n\n      This chapter does not relieve the operator of an authorized emergency\n      vehicle from:\n      (1) the duty to operate the vehicle with appropriate regard for the\n      safety of all persons; or\n      (2) the consequences of reckless disregard for the safety of others.\n\nTex. Transp. Code § 546.005.\n\n      However, before Plaintiffs can avail themselves of this provision of the\n\nTexas Transportation Code, they must first establish the waiver of Hidalgo\n\nCounty’s sovereign immunity under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.021(1).\n\n“A claim arising from the action of a governmental unit's employee while\n\nresponding    to   an   emergency   call    is   subject   to   Section   101.021.”\n\nCity of El Paso v. Hernandez, 16 S.W.3d 409, 415 (Tex. App. El Paso 2000).\n\n\n                                       10\n\f      Accordingly, Plaintiffs must first prove that the subject collision and death\n\nof the decedent were proximately caused by and “arise[s] from the use of a motor-\n\ndriven vehicle.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.021(1). Plaintiffs have not\n\ndone this and cannot do so, because they cannot establish the causal nexus.\n\n      For immunity to be waived under section 101.021, the government\n\nemployee must be the person who operated or used the motor vehicle that caused\n\nthe injury. LeLeaux, 835 S.W.2d at 51; Ramos v. City of San Antonio, 974 S.W.2d\n\n112, 116-17 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, no pet.)[emphasis added](holding\n\n\"immunity is only waived where the governmental employee, not a third party, is\n\nthe operator of the motor vehicle causing the injury\"). In this context, \"operation\"\n\nmeans \"a doing or performing of a practical work\" and \"use\" means \"to put or\n\nbring into action or service; to employ for or apply to a given purpose.\" LeLeaux\n\n835 S.W.2d at 51 (quoting Mount Pleasant Indep. Sch Dist. v. Estate of Lindburg,\n\n766 S.W.2d 208, 211 (Tex. 1989)).     The phrase \"arises from,\" as used in section\n\n101.021, requires a nexus between the operation or use of the motor vehicle and\n\nthe plaintiff's injuries. Whitley, 104 S.W.3d at 543; LeLeaux, 835 S.W.2d at 51.\n\nThe nexus must be more than mere involvement of the motor vehicle; the\n\ngovernment employee's operation or use of the vehicle \"must have actually caused\n\nthe injury.\" Whitley, 104 S.W.3d at 543 (quoting Texas Natural Resource\n\nConservation Com'n v. White, 46 S.W.3d 864, 869 (Tex. 2001)). \"[T]he operation\n\n\n                                        11\n\for use of a motor vehicle 'does not cause injury if it does no more than furnish the\n\ncondition that makes the injury possible.'\" Whitley, 104 S.W.3d at 543 (quoting\n\nDallas County Mental Health & Mental Retardation v. Bossley, 968 S.W.2d 339,\n\n343 (Tex. 1998)).\n\n      In a case factually similar to the case at hand, the Thirteenth Court of\n\nAppeals held that a “pursuit alone did not give rise to a waiver of immunity under\n\nthe [Tort Claims] Act.” Muniz v. Cameron County, 2012 Lexis 3816, WL 1656326,\n\nciting City of Dallas v. Hillis, 308 S.W.3d 526, 524-35 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010,\n\npet. denied). In Muniz, the family of a deceased motorist brought a wrongful death\n\nclaim against Cameron County when their family member was killed when a\n\nmotorist who was being pursued by a Cameron County Sheriff’s deputy veered\n\ninto the vehicle decedent was driving.\n\n      In City of Dallas v. Hillis, a Dallas police officer pursued a motorcyclist with\n\na passenger for a traffic violation. Subsequently the motorcyclist lost control of the\n\nmotorcycle, was involved in an accident and he and his passenger died. Hillis,\n\nsupra. The Hillis plaintiffs asserted that the City was liable for initiating and\n\ncontinuing a high speed chase. The City of Dallas had a no pursuit policy in place\n\nand the City of Dallas officer pursued Hillis at speeds of over 100 m.p.h. in an area\n\ngoverned by a 45 m.p.h. speed limit. “[a]t the moment of the accident, it still took\n\n[the officer] 10 seconds to reach the approximate area where Hillis lost control\n\n\n                                         12\n\fof his motorcycle.” Hillis, at 534 [emphasis added]. Concluding that “the claimants\n\ncould not meet the applicable Texas causation standard, because the police officer\n\ndid not hit the motorcycle with his patrol car and did not physically force the\n\nmotorcycle off the road or into another vehicle or object.” Id. [emphasis added],\n\nthe Dallas Court of Appeals held that there was no use of a motor vehicle that\n\ncaused the accident and therefore immunity was not waived.\n\n       The Dallas Court of Appeals employed similar reasoning in a 2011 case\n\ninvolving a pursuit by Dallas Police Department and Dallas Sheriff’s Department,\n\nin which the closest pursuing vehicle was 70 yards from the fleeing vehicle, the\n\nDallas Court of Appeals found the county and city’s operation of their vehicles\n\n“too physically and temporally separated” from the conduct of the fleeing driver\n\nto constitute a cause of plaintiff’s injuries. Teague v. City of Dallas, 344 S.W.3d\n\n434 (Tex. App.—Dallas, 2011).\n\n      The San Antonio Court of Appeals followed the Hillis court's reasoning in\n\nLopez v. Escobar. No. 04-13-00151-CV, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 10846, 2013 WL\n\n4679062, at *5 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Aug. 28, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.). In\n\nLopez, police officers signaled a truck to stop in a highway median, but the truck\n\ndriver instead darted into oncoming traffic and collided with Escobar, the plaintiff.\n\nId., at *2. In holding that the accident did not arise from the officer's operation or\n\nuse of a motor vehicle, the San Antonio Court of Appeals held that \"pursuing\" the\n\n\n                                         13\n\ftruck driver into the median did not proximately cause Escobar's injuries. Id., at *6.\n\nRather, the suspect driver caused them. Id.\n\n      In the case at hand, the Plaintiffs have not established a causal nexus with\n\ntheir injuries. In contrast, Hidalgo County has provided voluminous competent\n\nand uncontradicted evidence from independent witnesses which clearly\n\ndemonstrate that the closest Hidalgo County deputy to the fleeing vehicle (Ortega)\n\nwas approximately 2-3 minutes behind the fleeing vehicle, and was out of view\n\nand earshot of the undocumented immigrant passengers prior to the collision.\n\n      Two witnesses testify that they saw Hidalgo County Sheriff’s deputies arrive\n\nat the scene of the collision about two to three minutes after it occurred. 1CR102-\n\n103; 1CR270-272; App.Tab.9; 1CR98; 1CR267-269; App.Tab.9.\n\n      Notably, Sergio Veliz, an eyewitness to the collision itself, states that he was\n\ndriving eastbound on Curve Road about a half mile from the intersection with\n\nCesar Chavez Road, when he noticed the black Expedition speeding toward him.\n\nHe did not hear sirens or see an official car following the Expedition. The\n\nExpedition passed him and he saw the collision in his rear view mirror. He stopped\n\nhis vehicle and got off. About three minutes later he saw the Hidalgo County\n\nSheriff’s Office patrol units approaching the intersection, driving westbound on\n\nCurve Road. 1CR102-103; 1CR270-272; App.Tab.8.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f      Sergio Veliz’s brother, Armando Veliz states that he was in his shop at the\n\ncorner of Curve and Cesar Chavez Roads, when he heard a loud noise. He went\n\noutside to Curve Road and saw that a black Ford Expedition and a red car had\n\ncrashed. He saw five men and one woman get out of the Expedition and that two of\n\nthe men from the Expedition had been ejected. One of the men tried getting into\n\nhis house, but his wife closed the door. After two to three minutes he returned to\n\nhis shop and was standing outside it when he saw the black Ford Expedition from\n\nthe County arrive. 1CR98; 1CR267-269; App.Tab.9.\n\n      In her affidavit, Margarita Veliz describes several activities undertaken by\n\nher from the time that she heard the crash to the time she noticed the arrival of law\n\nenforcement officers on the scene. Ms Veliz states that she was at home at 4210\n\nCurve Road, Edinburg, Texas on the computer when she heard a loud noise\n\noutside. She and her son ran out through the front door and noticed a maroon car\n\nwith a man hanging out of the door. She remembers saying “Someone call 9-1-1.”\n\nShe then noticed that her daughter was outside and told her daughter to go inside\n\nand call 9-1-1. Ms. Veliz went back inside the house with her daughter to look for\n\nthe phone, but they were unable to find it. Ms. Veliz decided to go to her ex-\n\nhusband’s machine shop behind the house to use the phone. However, when she\n\nopened her back door she found an injured man on her doorstep asking to come in.\n\nShe tried to close the door on him and he pushed back, trying to get in. She pushed\n\n\n                                         15\n\fagainst him and was able to close and lock the door. She went back out through\n\nthe front door and was walking around the side of her house, when she saw the\n\nsame man lying on the ground. At that time, she noticed that “several cop cars” had\n\narrived and a law enforcement officer was standing next to the man on the ground.\n\n1CR104-105. App.Tab.10.        Had the vehicles driven by the Hidalgo County\n\ndeputies been visible or within audible range when Ms. Veliz first went outside,\n\nshe would not have felt a need to tell anyone to call 9-1-1. Ms. Veliz’s affidavit\n\nconfirms the reasonableness of her husband’s and brother-in-law’s estimates that\n\nthe Hidalgo County deputies arrived at the scene of the crash about two to three\n\nminutes after the fact.\n\n      The physical and temporal separation between the fleeing vehicle and\n\nDeputy Ortega’s unit in this case is further supported by the statements of two of\n\nthe immigrants who were being transported in the black Expedition, as taken by\n\nthe investigating agency, Texas Department of Public Safety. Claudia Janeth\n\nValdez Villarreal, who had been seated in the front passenger seat, described the\n\npursuit initiated by the City of Pharr police officer and stated that after the driver\n\ncrossed onto a dirt road and there was a lot of dust, he seemed to lose the police\n\nofficer. She no longer saw the police lights or [heard] the siren. Shortly after that\n\nshe saw a stop sign, the driver slowed, but continued through the intersection and\n\ncrashed into another vehicle.       1CR91. App.Tab.11. Ms. Valdez’s brother,\n\n\n                                         16\n\fFrancisco Javier Valdez Villarreal was in the middle of the second row of seats. He\n\nhad been told to keep his head down. He could hear the police sirens behind them.\n\nHe stated that they were chased by the police for what seemed like thirty minutes,\n\nthen he didn’t hear the police any more, but the driver continued to drive fast. He\n\nheard someone in the vehicle yell at the driver to let [the passengers] out, but the\n\ndriver did not respond. Shortly after that Mr. Valdez heard the screeching of tires\n\nand they crashed with another vehicle. 1CR92; App.Tab.12 [emphasis added].\n\n      Even if the Veliz brothers’ estimates of the Sheriff’s Office units arriving\n\ntwo to three minutes after the collision are slightly overestimated, it is clear that\n\nsufficient time had passed between the collision and the arrival of the Hidalgo\n\nCounty deputies to establish a physical and temporal separation sufficient to\n\nsupport a lack of causal nexus as applied by our Texas courts, particularly as\n\napplied in Hillis and Teague.\n\n      It is undisputed that the vehicle which collided with the car driven by the\n\ndecedent, Reynaldo Herrera was the black Expedition driven by Quintero, which\n\nwas the subject of the pursuit initiated by the City of Pharr, Texas. It is also\n\nundisputed that no deputy from Hidalgo County collided with Mr. Herrera’s\n\nvehicle. 1CR138-139; 1CR85-87; App.Tab.5; 1CR115-116.              Neither did any\n\nHidalgo County deputy “physically force” Quintero’s vehicle “off the road or into\n\nanother vehicle or object.” Deputy Ortega was thrust into a situation over which\n\n\n                                         17\n\fhe had no control when Quintero’s vehicle entered his jurisdiction at a high rate of\n\nspeed and blew past him. By the time Deputy Ortega became involved, events had\n\nalready been long set in motion. Even when the occupants of Quintero’s vehicle\n\nbelieved that the police were no longer pursuing and begged Quintero to stop and\n\nlet them out, Quintero chose to speed on toward the intersection of Curve and\n\nCesar Chavez Roads and into the path of Reynaldo Herrera’s vehicle. Quintero’s\n\nactions were the sole cause of Reynaldo Herrera’s death. Plaintiffs have offered no\n\ncontradictory evidence.\n\n      Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not established and cannot establish the\n\nrequired causal nexus between the death of Reynaldo Herrera and the actions of\n\nany Hidalgo County deputy and cannot defeat Hidalgo County’s sovereign\n\nimmunity.    Therefore, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs claims for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n      In the case at hand, Plaintiffs’ reliance on the plurality opinion in Travis v.\n\nCity of Mesquite, 830 S.W.2d 94 (Tex. 1992) is misguided. In Travis two off-duty\n\npolice officers pursued a fleeing suspect vehicle down a one-way highway access\n\nroad. The fleeing driver then crashed head on into another vehicle killing one\n\nperson and injuring others. Analyzing causation, the Travis court held that “[t]here\n\nwas summary judgment evidence that the conduct of the police officers was a\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fcause in fact of the accident in question, and of the injuries for which the plaintiffs\n\nseek recovery.” Id., at 98.\n\n      Like Plaintiffs herein, the Hillis plaintiffs relied on the holdings of the Travis\n\ncourt. Hillis, 308 S.W.3d at 535. However, the Hillis court found Travis to be\n\ndistinguishable, because “the defendants in Travis did not argue immunity as a\n\ndefense because the Travis court analyzed the case only as a general proximate-\n\ncause case, not an immunity case.” Travis, at 99; Hillis, at 535 [emphasis added].\n\n“Thus, the Travis court considered only the broad question of whether general\n\npolice negligence caused the accident in question; it did not consider the narrower\n\nissue of whether the use of a police car was the actual cause of the accident in\n\nquestion. By contrast, this case squarely presents the question of what constitutes a\n\nsufficient causal nexus between the use of a police vehicle and a subsequent\n\naccident.” Hillis, at 535.\n\n      Like the City of Dallas in Hillis, Hidalgo County appeals the denial of its\n\nplea to the jurisdiction. This case presents the same question— what constitutes a\n\nsufficient causal nexus between the use of a police vehicle and a subsequent\n\naccident—as does Hillis. When the Hillis causal nexus analysis is applied to the\n\nfacts of this case, it is clear that Plaintiffs’ claims do not arise out of Hidalgo\n\nCounty’s use of a Sheriff’s department vehicle and thus Hidalgo County’s\n\nimmunity has not been waived.\n\n\n                                          19\n\f2.    Hidalgo County is Not Liable Because Deputy Ortega Did Not Breach\n      the Emergency Standard of Care\n\n      A. The Standard of Care in an Emergency Action\n\n      Plaintiffs have pled that the Emergency Exception to the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct does not apply. This is a specific exception to the general waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity involving automobile accidents. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n101.055(2). Hidalgo County asserts that this exception bars Plaintiffs’ suit as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n      This section provides:\n\n      This chapter does not apply to a claim arising … from the action of an\n      employee while responding to an emergency call or reacting to an\n      emergency situation if the action is in compliance with the laws and\n      ordinances applicable to the emergency action, or in the absence of\n      such law or ordinance, if the action is not taken with conscious\n      indifference or reckless disregard for the safety of others.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.055(2).\n\n      The law applicable to emergency action in this context is section 546.005 of\n\nthe Texas Transportation Code. Tex. Dep’t of Pub. Safety v. Sparks, 347 S.W.3d\n\n834, 838 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 2011). This section, upon which Plaintiffs\n\nrely, provides that the driver of an emergency vehicle must drive with “appropriate\n\nregard for the safety of all persons,” and he is not relieved of “the consequences of\n\nreckless disregard for the safety of others.” Tex. Transp. Code § 546.005. The\n\nTexas Supreme Court has held that this provision “imposes a duty to drive with\n\n\n                                         20\n\fdue regard for others by avoiding negligent behavior, but it only imposes liability\n\nfor reckless conduct.” City of Amarillo v. Martin, 971 S.W.2d 426, 431 (Tex.\n\n1998)(interpreting the uncodified predecessor of Section 546.005). This requires\n\nmore than a momentary judgment lapse—it requires a showing that the driver\n\ncommitted an act he knew or should have known posed a high degree of risk of\n\nserious injury. Id., at 430; City of Pasadena v. Kuhn, 260 S.W.3d 93, 99 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, no pet.). In Martin, the court noted the Texas\n\nlegislature specifically excluded operation of emergency vehicles in emergency\n\nsituations from the general waiver of immunity for negligent operation of vehicles\n\ncontained in the TTCA and held, \"[w]ere we to . . . impose liability generally on\n\nemergency vehicle operators for mere negligence, we would render meaningless\n\nthe portion of section 101.055 that specifically excludes emergency vehicle\n\noperators from the waiver of immunity for negligence.\" Martin, 971 S.W.2d at\n\n430.\n\n       Further, the Texas Supreme Court has stated that the terms “conscious\n\nindifference” and “reckless disregard” “require proof that a party knew the\n\nrelevant facts but did not care about the result.” City of San Antonio v. Hartman,\n\n201 S.W.3d 667, 672 n.19 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f      Plaintiffs have offered no proof of what Deputy Ortega knew, what his\n\nthought processes were, that he chose to ignore any “relevant” facts, or that didn’t\n\ncare about the safety of others, including the decedent.\n\n      The only evidence of what Deputy Ortega knew is in his affidavit (1CR85-\n\n87; App.Tab.5), portions of which Plaintiffs and their expert have selectively\n\nchosen to ignore.\n\n      Deputy Ortega knew that:\n\n       “Pharr Police Department was in pursuit of a black Ford Expedition\n\n         traveling northbound on North Tower Road from FM 495 vehicle\n\n         possibly transporting narcotics (dope) in its vehicle’s contents.” 1CR85.\n\n       He could see from a distance “the red/blue emergency lights and wig\n\n         wags of the units involved in the pursuit.” 1CR85; App.Tab. 5.\n\n       He saw “the vehicle in question a black Ford Expedition with tinted\n\n         windows bearing Mexico license plates” pass him, “traveling at a very\n\n         high rate of speed disregarding the safety of others.” 1CR85-86;\n\n         App.Tab.5.\n\n       When he activated his lights and siren, “the suspect vehicle did not stop,\n\n         but continued traveling north on Tower at a high rate of speed.” 1CR86;\n\n         App.Tab.5.\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\f After he made his u-turn (at Canton Road), he saw that the vehicle was\n\n   already passing Iowa Road, one half mile further north. 1CR85-86;\n\n   App.Tab.5;1CR88;App.Tab.6.\n\n By the time he reached Iowa Road, he saw that the vehicle was already\n\n   headed westbound on Curve Road, 7/10th of a mile further north. 1CR86;\n\n   App.Tab.5; 1CR89; App.Tab.6.\n\n When he reached Curve Road, he turned west and discovered he had lost\n\n   sight of the black Expedition. He could only see a cloud of dust. 1CR86;\n\n   App.Tab.5.\n\n At the intersection of Curve Road and Alamo Road, he observed a white\n\n   Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office Expedition approach from the south.\n\n   1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\n He had no sight of the black Expedition as he proceeded west on Curve\n\n   Road until he arrived at the intersection of Curve Road and Cesar Chavez\n\n   Road and saw that it had been involved in a major traffic accident.\n\n   1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\n After the suspect turned onto Curve Road, Deputy Ortega was not even\n\n   engaged in the pursuit, because he had no “visual” on the black\n\n   Expedition. 1CR96; App.Tab7.\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\f      Plaintiffs’ allegations against Hidalgo County are based on the assumption\n\nthe Deputy Ortega was engaged in the pursuit and the common theme that Deputy\n\nOrtega should not have engaged in the “pursuit”; that it was reckless and\n\ndangerous to do so. For example, they allege that a reasonably prudent officer\n\nshould appreciate that a “prolonged pursuit … through residential neighborhoods\n\n… with many near crashes” should have been discontinued immediately (1CR198).\n\nHowever, they offer no evidence that Deputy Ortega had any knowledge of the\n\nlength and nature of the pursuit prior to his decision to respond to City of Pharr\n\nOfficer Gonzalez’s request for assistance, or during his response.\n\n      Plaintiffs also contend that “it was incumbent upon Sr. Deputy Ortega and\n\nhis supervisors to understand the justification for the chase and ask if the\n\njustification was absent or murky.” 1CR196. Plaintiffs conclude that Deputy\n\nOrtega “evidences a lack of good faith for initiating, engaging and continuing the\n\npursuit based on weak, legally faulty, or non-existent justification for the pursuit.”\n\n1CR196. Plaintiffs further conclude that “[b]ased upon the weak reasoning behind\n\nOfficer Gonzalez’ initiation of the pursuit, the assisting agencies should not have\n\ncommenced, continued, or assisted in the chase and doing so constituted a\n\nconscious disregard for public safety.” 1CR198. Plaintiffs offer no evidence that\n\nDeputy Ortega, or his supervisors, or any other Hidalgo County Deputy, knew that\n\nthe City of Pharr pursuit originated from a traffic stop based on a window tint\n\n\n                                         24\n\fviolation. Deputy Ortega’s affidavit makes it clear that he understood that the\n\nreason for the City of Pharr pursuit was because the vehicle was suspected of\n\ntransporting narcotics, as relayed to him by his dispatcher. 1CR85; App.Tab.5.\n\nThis is understandable when you consider that Deputy Gonzalez reported to his\n\ndispatcher that the vehicle had come out of a high drug traffic area, but did not tell\n\nhis dispatcher that he was pursuing the vehicle because of a window tint violation.\n\n1CR138; 2CR43, 45. Deputy Ortega’s affidavit also shows that he knew that the\n\nsuspect vehicle was black, with tinted windows, had Mexican license plates and\n\nwas raveling at a high rate of speed. 1CR85-86; App.Tab.5. Accordingly, in\n\nDeputy Ortega’s mind there was no “absent or murky,” “weak,” “legally faulty,”\n\nor “non-existent” justification for the City of Pharr’s pursuit and Plaintiffs have\n\npresented no evidence to the contrary.\n\n      Further, Deputy Ortega’s affidavit demonstrates how he proceeded to follow\n\nthe black Expedition cautiously with concern for the safety of the public. Despite\n\nthe fact that the fleeing vehicle was traveling at a “high rate of speed,” and was\n\npulling away from him, Ortega “made a complete stop at Curve Road where Tower\n\nRoad continues north towards highway 107 to avoid any incoming traffic\n\ntraveling south on Tower Road.” 1CR86; App.Tab.5. He then “drove slowly from\n\nTower Road on Curve Road towards Alamo Road since [he] no longer had sight of\n\nthe suspect vehicle and Curve Road surface was rough terrain with pot holes and\n\n\n                                         25\n\f[he] could not see the incoming traffic.” 1CR86; App.Tab.5. Upon arriving at\n\nAlamo Road, he “came to a complete stop to observe traffic at the intersection\n\ntraveling north and south.” 1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\n        In cases involving collisions between emergency vehicles and third parties3\n\nTexas courts have found more direct factual evidence to be insufficient to show\n\nreckless disregard and conscious indifference . See Kuhn, 260 S.W.3d at 99-100,\n\n(holding that officer’s actions not taken with conscious indifference or reckless\n\ndisregard for safety of citizen when officer collided with citizen after slowing\n\ndown to enter intersection); Pakdimounivong v. City of Arlington, 219 S.W.3d 401,\n\n411-12 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied)(holding that officers’ actions\n\nwere not taken with conscious indifference or reckless disregard for safety of\n\nothers when no evidence showed that officers did not care what happened to\n\ndeceased); Smith v. Janda, 126 S.W.3d 543, 545-46 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2003, no pet.)(holding evidence insufficient to establish recklessness when\n\nambulance driven to emergency with lights and sirens activated as it approached\n\nintersection, other drivers at intersection could hear and see sirens and lights,\n\nambulance driver slowed down, looked and then proceeded into intersection\n\nwithout coming to a complete stop); City of San Angelo Fire Dept. v. Hudson, 179\n\n\n3\n  Hidalgo County has been unable to find a single case in which the courts have applied the reckless\ndisregard standard to an officer involved in an incident in which a fleeing suspect collides with a third party\nmotorist.\n\n                                                      26\n\fS.W.3d 695, 701-702 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no pet.)(holding no evidence of\n\nreckless disregard for safety of others when officer entered intersection without\n\nstopping and witness did not hear brakes being applied).\n\n      In the instant case, competent evidence proves that Deputy Ortega’s actions\n\nwere in compliance with the laws and ordinances applicable to emergency action\n\nand that he demonstrated consummate concern for the safety of others, as set out\n\nabove. The fact that he was 2-3 minutes behind Quintero’s vehicle further\n\nevidences his exercise of due caution under exigent circumstances. Plaintiffs have\n\noffered no competent evidence of recklessness, or of any conscious disregard for\n\nthe safety of the public on the part of Deputy Ortega. Neither have Plaintiffs\n\nproduced evidence sufficient to establish a material fact issue regarding the\n\nstandard of care relating to emergency pursuits. Consequently, the waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity under section 101.055(2) of the Tort Claims Act does not\n\napply and Hidalgo County retains its immunity. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims\n\nmust be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n3.    Hidalgo County Is Not Liable Because Deputy Ortega Was Acting\n      Within the Scope of His Authority and In Good Faith.\n\n      Hidalgo County is also immune from Plaintiffs’ claims based on the official\n\nimmunity of Deputy Ortega. Had Deputy Ortega been individually named as a\n\nparty to this suit, he would be entitled to official immunity under Texas law. If\n\nofficial immunity protects the employee from liability, then the governmental\n                                         27\n\fentity's sovereign immunity remains intact. Univ. of Houston v. Clark, 38 S.W.3d\n\n578, 580 (Tex. 2000); City of Houston v. Kilburn, 849 S.W.2d 810, 812 (Tex.\n\n1993) (per curiam).\n\n      Official immunity protects government employees from personal liability\n\nwhen employees perform discretionary duties within the scope of their authority\n\nand are acting in good faith. Clark, at 580; City of San Antonio v. Ytuarte, 2005\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 10824, *7 (Tex. App. San Antonio Sept. 14, 2005); see also City\n\nof Lancaster v. Chambers, 883 S.W.2d 650, 653, 37 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 980 (Tex.\n\n1994).\n\n      There is no dispute that Deputy Ortega was acting in the scope of his\n\nauthority. 1CR143. However, Plaintiffs surprisingly allege that “employees,\n\nofficers and agents of the Defendants are not entitled to immunity because the\n\npursuit was a ministerial act and not conducted in good faith.” 1CR143.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court defines discretionary functions as being those\n\nactions that involve personal deliberation, decision, and judgment. Chambers, 883\n\nS.W.2d at 654. The Chambers court also defines ministerial functions as being\n\nthose actions that require obedience to orders or to the performance of a duty for\n\nwhich the actor has no choice. Id. When a police officer is driving a vehicle in a\n\nnon-emergency setting, he or she is performing a ministerial function. Harris Cnty.\n\nv. Gibbons, 150 S.W.3d 877, 886 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.),\n\n\n                                        28\n\fbut when an officer engages in a high-speed vehicular pursuit, the officer performs\n\na discretionary function. Chambers, 883 S.W.2d at 655. A police officer's\n\noperation of a vehicle is discretionary in some situations. These include high-speed\n\nchases; investigations; traffic stops; and an officer's decision to violate traffic laws\n\nto respond quickly to an officer's call for assistance. Harless v. Niles, 100 S.W.3d\n\n390, 397 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.). Thus, Deputy Ortega was\n\nperforming a discretionary function as a matter of law.\n\n      Further, despite alleging that Deputy Ortega’s actions (and those of other\n\nHidalgo County Sheriff’s deputies) were ministerial, Plaintiffs’ criticism of Deputy\n\nOrtega is based on alleged discretionary acts, as follows:\n\n      f.     Senior Deputy Ortega evidences a lack of good faith for\n\n             initiating, engaging and continuing the pursuit based on weak,\n\n             faulty or non-existent justification for the pursuit. 1CR145.\n\n             and\n\n      g.     It was the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office’s actions and the\n\n             decision not to get the justification for the pursuit and not to\n\n             engage or terminate quickly who decided to chase and who got\n\n             the momentum going. 1CR145.\n\nPlaintiffs also state that “it is commonly acceptable police standards and practices\n\nthat the danger of the situation should not outweigh the justification for their\n\n\n                                          29\n\finvolvement” and allege that Deputy Ortega made a “willful decision to ignore\n\nthis.” 1CR145. They also allege that Deputy Ortega “involved himself willfully in\n\nthe pursuit in question.” 1CR146.       All of these allegations demonstrate that\n\nPlaintiffs really believe that Deputy Ortega had the discretion to make such\n\ndecisions.\n\n      Additionally, the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Sheriff Job\n\nDescription makes it clear that deputies are expected to perform discretionary\n\nfunctions. For example, under the paragraph entitled “Essential Duties and\n\nResponsibilities” a deputy may perform the duty of responding “to emergency calls\n\nand routine complaints and take action as necessary.” (Emphasis added). 1CR106.\n\nA necessary skill of the job is the “ability to analyze situations and adopt a quick,\n\neffective and reasonable course of action.” 1CR108. Under “Safety Requirement,”\n\na deputy must “maintain mental capacity which permits … making sound decisions\n\nand using good judgment.” 1CR110.\n\n      To establish good faith, Hidalgo County must show that a reasonably\n\nprudent officer in the same or similar situation could have believed that the need\n\nfor officers to respond outweighs the risks associated with the officers' actions.\n\nWadewitz v. Montgomery, 951 S.W.2d 464, 466-67, 40 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 894 (Tex.\n\n1997). The test of good faith adopted by the Chambers court “is one of objective\n\nlegal reasonableness” and “qualified immunity protects all but the plainly\n\n\n                                         30\n\fincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.” Chambers, 883 S.W.2d at\n\n656.\n\n       The evidence herein establishes that Deputy Ortega would be entitled to\n\nofficial immunity and that each of the good faith test elements set out by the Texas\n\nSupreme Court in Wadewitz and Chambers have been met.\n\n       As stated above, by the time the City of Pharr Police Department’s request\n\nfor assistance was relayed to Deputy Ortega, events had already been set in motion.\n\nAny risk to the safety of the public long pre-existed his involvement. Immediately\n\nafter receiving request for assistance, Quintero’s vehicle entered Deputy Ortega’s\n\njurisdiction “driving at a high rate of speed disregarding the safety of others.”\n\n1CR85-86; App.Tab.5. At the time, Deputy Ortega had no knowledge of the\n\nduration or nature of the City of Pharr pursuit. Deputy Ortega activated his lights\n\nand siren in an attempt to stop the vehicle, but it continued on at a high rate of\n\nspeed. 1CR86; App.Tab.5. Deputy Ortega followed the fleeing vehicle cautiously,\n\nout of a concern for the safety of the public, stopping at intersections and allowing\n\nit get so far ahead of him that he quickly lost sight of it. 1CR86; App.Tab.5; J.\n\nLopez Video at 2:01.      The evidence clearly establishes that Deputy Ortega\n\nbalanced the need for taking the conservative action that he took against any risk to\n\nthe public beyond what already existed and proceeded accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f      The Plaintiffs have not offered, and cannot offer, competent evidence to\n\nshow that no reasonably prudent officer under the same or similar circumstances\n\ncould have believed that Deputy Ortega should have responded differently and\n\nshould not have followed the fleeing suspect in the manner in which he did.\n\nPlaintiffs’ expert, Richard Weinblatt offers no more than conclusory statements\n\nwithout factual basis regarding the good faith actions of Deputy Ortega and\n\nHidalgo County:\n\n      “In my opinion, Officer Gonzales and Sr. Deputy Ortega evidenced a\n\n      lack of good faith for initiating, engaging, and continuing the pursuit\n\n      based on weak, faulty, or non-existent justification for the pursuit …”\n\n      1CR171; 1CR238; App.Tab.17, p.7.\n\nand\n\n      “It is also true that a reasonable and prudent officer should see that a\n\n      prolonged pursuit (including “following”) like this, through residential\n\n      neighborhoods (houses are visible on the sides of the street), with\n\n      many near crashes, should have been discontinued almost\n\n      immediately.”\n\n      1CR180; 1CR247; App.Tab.17, p.16.\n\n      Dr. Weinblatt chooses to ignore that fact that Deputy Ortega understood that\n\nthe basis for the pursuit was because the fleeing vehicle was suspected of\n\n\n                                        32\n\ftransporting narcotics. 1CR85; App.Tab.5. He also fails to consider that Officer\n\nGonzalez did not advise his City of Pharr dispatcher that he initiated the pursuit\n\nbased on a window tint violation and reported to his dispatcher that the vehicle had\n\ncome out of a high drug traffic area. 1CR138; 2CR43, 45. Therefore, there was no\n\n“weak, faulty, or non-existent justification for the pursuit” as Deputy Ortega\n\nunderstood it.\n\n         Further, Dr. Weinblatt, in an all-seeing position of hindsight, after review\n\nseveral dashcam videos from the vehicles of different law enforcement agencies,\n\ndocumenting the pursuit from beginning to end, incorrectly assumes that Deputy\n\nOrtega had knowledge of the duration and nature of the pursuit prior to his\n\ninvolvement.\n\n         Dr. Weinblatt’s conclusory statements are insufficient to support or defeat\n\nsummary judgment. Wadewitz at 466. Therefore, they are not competent evidence\n\nin a Plea to the Jurisdiction and fail to raise a question of fact. Further, Dr.\n\nWeinblatt fails to substantiate his opinion with reference to each aspect of the\n\nChambers balancing test with respect to Deputy Ortega and as required by\n\nChambers and Wadewitz. See Wadewitz, 951 S.W.2d at 467.\n\n         For the above reasons, Deputy Ortega is entitled to official immunity and\n\nHidalgo County’s sovereign immunity remains intact. Clark, supra; Kilburn,\n\nsupra.\n\n\n                                          33\n\f4.     The Report of “Expert” Weinblatt Is Not Based Upon a Reliable\n       Foundation and Must Be Regarded as No Evidence, and the Trial Court\n       Erred in Failing to Exclude it from Consideration.\n\n       Not only is the “expert” report full of conclusory and unsupported\n\nstatements, it does not meet the basic reliability requirements of Daubert and its\n\nprogeny. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 595 (1993). The\n\nauthoritative treatise on such requirements is “ARTICLE: EIGHT GATES FOR\n\nEXPERT WITNESSES: FIFTEEN YEARS LATER”, 52 Hous. L. Rev. 1.\n\nApp.Tab18. The gatekeeping function of the trial judge is mandatory.4 Id. at p.4.\n\n\"The trial court serves as an evidentiary gatekeeper by screening out irrelevant and\n\nunreliable expert evidence … .\" Southland Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Cantu, 399 S.W.3d\n\n558, 563 (Tex. App. - San Antonio 2011, pet. denied).\n\n       In this case, Appellant Defendant Hidalgo County challenged the reliability\n\nof the “expert” testimony offered by affidavit by “Hidalgo County’s Motion to\n\nExclude Richard Weinblatt’s Report”, and a letter brief to the Court.\n\n4\n  Russell v. Whirlpool Corp., 702 F.3d 450, 456 (8th Cir. 2012) (“[T]he assumption of\nthe gatekeeper role is mandatory, not discretionary.”). The Tenth Circuit recently stated that a\ntrial judge’s gatekeeping role is sufficiently important so that the judge (1) cannot simply “say\non the record that [he] has decided to admit the expert testimony after due consideration” but\nrather should “furnish enough of a record to permit a reviewing court to say with confidence\nthat it ‘properly applied the relevant law’” and (2) “must reply in some meaningful way to the\nDaubert concerns the objector has raised,” although the judge does not have to discuss every\nDaubert factor. Storagecraft Tech. Corp. v. Kirby, 744 F.3d 1183, 1190 (10th Cir. 2014).\nSimilarly the Ninth Circuit stated that given “[t]he potentially significant influence of expert\ntestimony,” trial judges must engage in “assiduous ‘gatekeeping.’” Barabin v. AstenJohnson,\nInc., 700 F.3d 428, 432 (9th Cir. 2012), on reh’g en banc sub nom. Estate of Barabin v.\nAstenJohnson, Inc., 740 F.3d 457 (9th Cir. 2014). (Note 12, 52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, 4.)\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fApp.Tab.19,20; 1CR273-284; 1CR377-379. The trial court also heard arguments at\n\nthe hearing, but did not rule on the record or by signed order regarding the Motion\n\nto Exclude, except by implication when it denied the Plea to the Jurisdiction almost\n\n9 months later. 3RR4,7,8,17-39; 1CR405; App.Tab.1. It was error for the trial\n\ncourt not to exclude such report from consideration, and this Court must review the\n\ndecision (or failure to decide) to exclude the report de novo as a part of its review\n\nof the trial court’s denial of the Plea to Jurisdiction. Such review and consideration\n\nis inherent to any analysis of the basis of such denial.\n\n      Accordingly, County of Hidalgo adopts and re-urges those arguments set out\n\nin the subject motion to exclude, letter brief, and in the transcript of the hearing on\n\nthe motion. App.Tab19,20; 1CR273-284; 1CR377-379; 3RR4,7,8,17-39.\n\n      Dr. Weinblatt provided a resume that may qualify him as an expert on police\n\nprocedure, but it does not qualify him on accident reconstruction or the causation\n\nissues that flow seamlessly through his report. (See 1CR321 et. seq.); TXI Transp.\n\nCo. v. Hughes, 306 S.W.3d 230, 234 (Tex. 2010) (“For an expert’s testimony to be\n\nadmissible, the expert witness must be qualified to testify about ‘scientific,\n\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge,’ and the testimony must be relevant and\n\nbased upon a reliable foundation.”) Nowhere does his resume indicate an expertise\n\nin accident reconstruction, and his opinions are not based upon a reliable\n\nfoundation.\n\n\n                                          35\n\f      For example, as detailed above, his report imputes information to the County\n\nDeputy without any basis for such imputation because the only evidence about\n\nwhat the Deputy knew is his own affidavit about what was told to him by his\n\ndispatcher. Further, Weinblatt applies facts he gleans from the dash cam of the\n\nPharr Police officer to the decisions and actions made by the Hidalgo County\n\ndeputy without a basis for such application. Certainly, there is no evidence that the\n\nHidalgo County deputy saw the Pharr Police dash cam and knew that the fleeing\n\nsuspect had been pursued through a high traffic area in Alamo with swerving\n\ncivilian vehicles. App.Tab17,p.3-5; 1CR167-5. There was no dash cam footage\n\nfrom the perspective of Deputy Ortega’s vehicle for Weinblatt to review, as his\n\nreport admits. Id.\n\n      All of this demonstrates that the expert report is incompetent evidence upon\n\nwhich to base a denial of the Plea to the Jurisdiction. As set out in Wadewitz,\n\n             An expert's testimony will support summary judgment only if it is\n      \"clear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions\n      and inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted\" TEX. R.\n      CIV. P. 166a(c). Conclusory statements by an expert are insufficient to\n      support or defeat summary judgment. See Anderson v. Snider, 808 S.W.2d\n      54, 55 (Tex. 1991); see also Mercer v. Daoran Corp., 676 S.W.2d 580, 583\n      (Tex. 1984); Brownlee v. Brownlee, 665 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex. 1984). Thus,\n      an expert witness's conclusory statement that a reasonable officer could or\n      could not have taken some action will neither establish good faith at the\n      summary judgment stage nor raise a fact issue to defeat summary judgment.\n      Instead, expert testimony on good faith must address what a reasonable\n      officer could have believed under circumstances, see Chambers, 883 S.W.2d\n      at 656-57, and must be substantiated with reference to each aspect of the\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      Chambers balancing test. Wadewitz v. Montgomery, 951 S.W.2d 464, 466-\n      467, (Tex. 1997).\n\nIn this case, the report is neither clear, nor positive, nor direct. It does not address\n\nwhat a reasonable officer could have believed under the circumstances, it relies\n\nupon conclusory statements, and it reaches conclusions about which the expert is\n\nnot qualified, and which are without sound foundation. Accordingly, such report\n\nshould have been excluded from consideration relative to the Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction and should be disregarded by this court in its review of the decision of\n\nthe trial court’s denial of such plea.\n\n                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      Because the Plaintiffs cannot establish causation as a matter of law, based\n\nupon the undisputed facts, because such facts do not show any breach of the\n\napplicable “emergency” vehicle standard of care, because the County deputy was\n\nacting in good faith in the scope of his duties, and covered by his discretionary\n\nimmunity, and because the Plaintiffs’ expert was unqualified and his opinions were\n\nunreliable and unsupported by the facts, the trial court erred in denying the Plea to\n\nthe Jurisdiction of Hidalgo County. Each of the four reasons cited would justify a\n\nreversal of such decision. Accordingly, Hidalgo County prays that this court\n\nreverse and render a final judgment of no liability in favor of Hidalgo County and\n\nagainst the plaintiffs on the pleadings, for costs, and for such other and further\n\nrelief to which Hidalgo County is entitled, in law and in equity.\n                                          37\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\n/s/ Preston Henrichson\n\nPreston Henrichson\nState Bar No. 09477000\nLAW OFFICES OF PRESTON HENRICHSON,\nP.C.\n222 W.

Rev. 1, *1\n\ncausation. … Texas courts of appeals have reached differing results, for example, with respect to\nwhether Havner requires the exclusion of epidemiological studies that do not show a ″doubling of the\nrisk″ in FELA cases, in which the standard of proof for causation is significantly lower: the claimant\nneed only show that the employer’s negligence ″played a part - no matter how small - in bringing about\nthe claimant’s injury.″ … The Bostic Court shed addition light on Flores’s substantial factor standard\nof causation, holding that it (1) applies to mesothelioma cases as well as asbestosis cases; (2) does not\nrequire a plaintiff to present defendant-specific evidence of but-for causation; and (3) does require a\nplaintiff to, in the absence of ″direct proof of causation,″ present evidence that ″the plaintiff’s exposure\nto the defendant’s product more than doubled his risk of contracting the disease,″ which ″must be\nshown through reliable expert testimony that is based on epidemiological studies or similarly reliable\nscientific testimony″ - i.e., the plaintiff must show that his exposure to each defendant’s products was\nat or above the level of exposure at which his epidemiological evidence showed an above-2.0 relative\nrisk under Havner. … When an expert attempts to rely on an MSDS not for discrete data but to supply\na conclusion on causation, the MSDS must stand up to the same standards applicable to any expert\nopinion on causation; i.e., the proffering party must demonstrate the predicative, methodological, and\nconnective reliability of the analysis that led to the conclusion in the MSDS regarding causation. …\nSimilarly, another Texas court of appeals reversed a lost profits award and rendered a take-nothing\njudgment when the only evidence of lost profits was expert testimony predicated on unfounded\nassumptions. … The Court held that the expert testimony was conclusory under a connective reliability\nanalysis, but the Court specifically approved of the attorney’s use of other settlements as factual\npredicates for his opinion on the value of the Elizondos’ underlying claims: Under Evidence Rule 703,\nexperts may base their testimony on facts or data that are ″of a type reasonably relied upon by experts\nin the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.″ … Because it was based on\nthe unsupported assumptions that the lint transport tube was clogged and that large lint particles could\nhave passed through the dryer’s inlet grill, the expert testimony in Whirlpool lacked predicative\nreliability (as well as connective reliability, as discussed below). iv. … Consistent with the Seventh\nCircuit’s caution that foundational data for an expert opinion cannot be quantitatively or qualitatively\ndisconnected from the facts of the case, Texas courts have rejected damages opinions based on an\nacceptable methodology when the predicative data used in the calculations lacks sufficient similarity\nor comparability to the facts of the case. … The court held that a police officer could rely on hearsay\nstatements made by gang members during custodial and noncustodial interviews, statements made by\nother law enforcement officers, intercepted telephone conversations, and printed and online materials\nbecause law enforcement officers ″routinely and reasonably rely upon hearsay in reaching their\nconclusions.″ … It subsequently rejected ″a bright-line rule for testing in fire cases″ and stated that a\nfire expert can in some circumstances ″offer a reliable opinion based upon specific observation and\nexpertise.″ … The court disagreed, stating that the engineer used well-established principles of physics\nin his calculations, principles that ″have been used and tested (i.e., peer reviewed) by physicists and\nengineers for centuries,″ that his ″mathematical models (a form of test) appeared to be well-grounded\nin the facts and data available,″ and that he used the well-accepted differential-etiology approach,\n″starting from the known facts about the accident and eliminating other possible explanations … until\nhe was left with a hypothesis that was physically possible and that fit the evidence.″ … The Ninth\nCircuit stated in Daubert II that when scientific experts cannot cite any supporting peer-reviewed\npublication, the experts must explain precisely how they went about reaching their conclusions and\npoint to some objective source - a learned treatise, the policy statement of a professional association,\na published article in a reputable scientific journal or the like - to show that they have followed the\n\f                                                                                              Page 3 of 230\n                                           52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *1\n\nscientific evidence method, as it is practiced by (at least) a recognized minority of scientists in their\nfield. … Importantly, the Crump Court applied both the Daubert factors and Gammill’s ″analytical\ngap″ test to the expert’s testimony, stating that ″the mere fact that differential diagnosis was used does\nnot exempt the foundation of a treating physician’s expert opinion from scrutiny - it is to be evaluated\nfor reliability as carefully as any other expert’s testimony. … The Texas Supreme Court has used a\nnumber of phrases to describe the requirements under this gate: the expert must connect the opinion\nwith the existing data, show ″the connection between the data relied on and the opinion offered,″\n″connect the data relied on and his or her opinion and … show how that data is valid support for the\nopinion reached,″ connect ″the expert’s theory to the underlying facts and data in the case,″ connect\nthe expert’s ″observations with his conclusions,″ ″explain the basis of the expert’s statements to link\nhis conclusions to the facts,″ ″explain why″ the data lead to the conclusion, show ″how″ his\nobservations support his conclusions, demonstrate the stated basis for an opinion supports the opinion,\nshow ″the manner in which the principles and methodologies are applied by the expert to reach the\nconclusions,″ and ensure there is no ″flaw in the expert’s reasoning from the data″ that renders the\nexpert’s opinions ″dubious.″ … Importantly, in Whirlpool, the Court rejected the contention that\nexperience can always be used to fill gaps in an expert’s application of the principles, methodologies,\nand facts of the case: If courts merely accept ″experience″ as a substitute for proof that an expert’s\nopinions are reliable and then only examine the testimony for analytical gaps in the expert’s logic and\nopinions, an expert can effectively insulate his or her conclusions from meaningful review by filling\ngaps in the testimony with almost any type of data or subjective opinions. … Based on his experience\nin conducting hundreds of tests with vehicles with soft rubber tires, regular passenger cars, and harder\ntruck tires, he concluded that the test results between the two types of vehicles were consistent. … In\nshort, we have demonstrated that a litigator must endeavor to understand the three reliability gates and\nthe distinctions between them to ensure that each is satisfied, to determine how and when to preserve\nobjections based on each, and to anticipate and protect against postverdict attacks on the reliability of\nexpert testimony. … The key lessons that parties offering and opposing expert testimony should take\naway from this Article are (1) in Texas, expert opinions are subject to both admissibility and\nlegal-sufficiency challenges based on reliability; (2) causation opinions are subject to particularly\nexacting scrutiny; (3) it is the basis of an expert’s opinion, not his qualifications to offer an opinion,\nthat gives the opinion probative value; (4) an expert must identify the basis or predicate for his opinion,\nand if the expert fails to do so, or if the predicate identified is not reliable or does not support the\nexpert’s opinion, the expert’s opinion is likewise not reliable; (5) reliability is not correctness - an\nopinion that is the product of an unreliable methodology is not reliable even if it happens to be correct,\nand conflicting opinions that result from different but reliable methodologies may both be reliable even\nif one is necessarily incorrect; and (6) when an expert opinion is founded in part on reasoning and\nanalysis, a meaningful ″analytical gap″ in the expert’s logic renders the opinion unreliable.\n\nHighlight\nAbstract\n\nExpert testimony can make or break a case at trial. And in Texas, it can make or break the case on\nappeal too. This Article examines developments in the law - with an emphasis on Texas law -\ngoverning the admissibility and evidentiary weight of expert evidence over the last fifteen years.

While some\nattention is given to recent decisions addressing an expert’s qualifications or the relevance and\nhelpfulness of an expert’s opinion, the focus of the Article and the recent case law is on the reliability\nof an expert’s opinions. Breaking the reliability requirement into subcategories, we explore exactly\nwhat it takes for an expert opinion to be reliable and examine when and how an unreliable expert\nopinion can be challenged for the first time postverdict, even if admitted without objection.\n\n    Text\n    [*3]\nIntroduction\nThis Article addresses significant developments in admissibility and reliability challenges to expert\nevidence in the fifteen years since the Houston Law Review’s 1999 article, Eight Gates for Expert\nWitnesses. 1 ″The expert witness occupies a unique place in our adversarial system of justice.″ 2 A jury\nmay view an expert witness as ″an objective authority figure more knowledgeable and credible than\nthe typical lay witness,″ 3 and because an expert necessarily testifies about a subject that is beyond the\ncommon knowledge of the jury, 4 the jury is not as well [*4] equipped to question the reliability of\nthe expert’s opinion. In addition to this heightened potency and considerable insulation from the jury’s\ntypical assessment of reliability, 5 an expert witness is ″generally unfettered″ 6 by many of the\nevidentiary constraints that cabin the testimony of lay witnesses - testifying experts need not have\nfirsthand knowledge, 7 they may base their testimony on material that is otherwise inadmissible, 8 and\nthey may opine on mixed issues of law and fact, including even ultimate issues in the case. 9 For these\nreasons, although the jury assesses the reliability of other types of evidence, 10 the reliability of an\n\n\n\n1\n      See generally Harvey Brown, Eight Gates for Expert Witnesses, 36 Hous.

Ct. 716, 728 (2012) (″The jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence.″).\nIn State v. Smith, the court stated that although a jury determines the credibility of a witness, ″unreliable evidence should never reach\n\f                                                                                                                               Page 5 of 230\n                                                          52 Hous.

Smith, 335 S.W.3d 706, 714 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. ref’d). This is true for expert testimony but\nis not true for other ″unreliable″ evidence that is admissible under the rules of evidence.\n11\n      Brown, supra note 1, at 744; see also Southland Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Cantu, 399 S.W.3d 558, 563 (Tex. App. - San Antonio 2011,\npet. denied) (″The trial court serves as an evidentiary gatekeeper by screening out irrelevant and unreliable expert evidence … .″).\n12\n      Russell v. Whirlpool Corp., 702 F.3d 450, 456 (8th Cir. 2012) (″The assumption of the gatekeeper role is mandatory, not\ndiscretionary.″). The Tenth Circuit recently stated that a trial judge’s gatekeeping role is sufficiently important so that the judge (1) cannot\nsimply ″say on the record that [he] has decided to admit the expert testimony after due consideration″ but rather should ″furnish enough\nof a record to permit a reviewing court to say with confidence that it ″properly applied the relevant law’″ and (2) ″must reply in some\nmeaningful way to the Daubert concerns the objector has raised,″ although the judge does not have to discuss every Daubert factor.\nStoragecraft Tech. Corp. v. Kirby, 744 F.3d 1183, 1190 (10th Cir. 2014). Similarly the Ninth Circuit stated that given ″the potentially\nsignificant influence of expert testimony,″ trial judges must engage in ″assiduous ″gatekeeping.’″ Barabin v. AstenJohnson, Inc., 700 F.3d\n428, 432 (9th Cir. 2012), on reh’g en banc sub nom. Estate of Barabin v. AstenJohnson, Inc., 740 F.3d 457 (9th Cir. 2014). On rehearing\nen banc the court stated that trial judges ″cannot abdicate″ their role as gatekeeper by ″delegating that role to the jury.″ Estate of Barabin,\n740 F.3d at 464.\n13\n       Brown, supra note 1, at 751-57.\n14\n       Id. at 757-72.\n15\n     Id. at 778-875. In the 1999 article, the reliability gates were addressed in this order: methodological reliability (gate four),\nconnective reliability (gate five), and foundational reliability (gate six). Id. In this Article, we begin with foundational reliability, which\nwe have renamed ″predicative reliability,″ see infra Part III.B, because it provides useful groundwork for the other reliability sections.\nPredicative reliability is followed by methodological reliability, then connective reliability.\n\nWe do not separately address Rule 403 (gate eight in the 1999 article). See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 746 (3d Cir.\n1994) (″Rule 702 analysis partly incorporates Rule 403 analysis but leaves some room for Rule 403 to operate independently.″); Scott\nv. State, 165 S.W.3d 27, 57 (Tex. App. - Austin 2005) (concluding testimony was unhelpful, unreliable, and violated Rule 403), rev’d\non other grounds, 227 S.W.3d 670 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). In ATA Airlines, Inc. v. Federal Express Corp., the Seventh Circuit concluded\nthat an expert’s testimony was not only unreliable but also violated Rule 403 when the lawyer could not even explain the testimony. ATA\nAirlines, Inc. v. Fed. Express Corp., 665 F.3d 882, 890, 896 (7th Cir. 2011). The lawyers’ examinations of the expert during trial\n″were perfunctory and must have struck most, maybe all, of the jurors as gibberish … If a party’s lawyer cannot understand the testimony\nof the party’s own expert, the testimony should be withheld from the jury. Evidence unintelligible to the trier or triers of fact has no place\nin a trial.″\n\nId. at 896.\nReliance on inadmissible evidence (gate seven) is discussed as part of ″predicative reliability,″ the first of the three reliability gates. See\ninfra Part III.B. Because it is more accurate to describe the inquiries under this gate as part of the predicative reliability gate, we now\nbelieve there are seven, not eight, gates. We briefly discuss the relevance gate (gate three) in Part II.B.\n16\n      In this Article, we do not address the distinction between expert and lay witness testimony. See United States v. Yanez Sosa, 513\nF.3d 194, 200 (5th Cir. 2008) (stating that ″lay testimony ″results from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life,’ while expert\ntestimony ″results from a process of reasoning which can be mastered only by specialists in the field’″ (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 701\nadvisory committee’s note (2000 Amendment))). Nor do we address when expert testimony is necessary. See, e.g., Wills v. Amerada Hess\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 6 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *6\n\nreliable foundation, and this foundation is found in the three reliability gates. 17 As stated by the U.S.\nSupreme Court, the standards of reliability applicable to expert evidence are ″exacting.″ 18 Our choice\nto focus on these five gates is driven in part by the text of Rule 702. The Ninth Circuit recently\nparaphrased the text of Rule 702 as identifying these five gates:\n\nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that expert opinion evidence is admissible if: (1)\nthe witness is sufficiently qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education;\n(2) the scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (3) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (4) the\ntestimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (5) the expert has reliably applied the\nrelevant principles and methods to the facts of the case. 19\nThe Sixth Circuit also states that a ″parsing [of] the language of the Rule″ reveals that a proposed\nexpert’s opinion must satisfy three requirements: 20 the expert is qualified, the opinion is sufficiently\nreliable under Daubert, 21 and the testimony assists the [*7] trier of fact. 22 Because the reliability\ninquiry is three gates, it therefore likewise concludes that there are five gates. The Sixth, 23 Seventh,\n24\n   Eighth, 25 and Eleventh 26 Circuits all utilize the same summary of Rule 702’s requirements. 27 The\nThird Circuit agrees that ″Rule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony″ and lists\nCorp., 379 F.3d 32, 46 (2d Cir. 2004) (″Where an injury has multiple potential etiologies, expert testimony is necessary to establish\ncausation.″); Guevara v. Ferrer, 247 S.W.3d 662, 668 (Tex. 2007) (explaining when medical testimony is necessary on medical\ncausation); Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 583 (Tex. 2006) (stating expert testimony is necessary to establish design\ndefects and causation); FFE Transp. Servs., Inc. v. Fulgham, 154 S.W.3d 84, 91 (Tex. 2004) (holding expert testimony necessary because\njurors do not ″know what the standard of care is for the inspection and maintenance of the upper coupler assembly, kingpin, and base\nrail of a refrigerated trailer″); Alexander v. Turtur & Assocs., 146 S.W.3d 113, 119-20 (Tex. 2004) (finding expert testimony to be\nnecessary in attorney malpractice cases to prove cause-in-fact); Rehabilitative Care Sys. of Am. v. Davis, 73 S.W.3d 233, 234 (Tex. 2002)\n(per curiam) (holding expert testimony necessary to establish standard of care for negligent-supervision-of-physical-therapist claim). We\nalso do not address whether expert testimony should be excluded because the expert’s testimony ″misapplies established legal rules and\nprinciples,″ see Williams v. State, 406 S.W.3d 273, 283-84 (Tex. App. - San Antonio 2013, pet. denied) (holding that the appraiser did\nnot violate legal principles); see also Enbridge Pipelines (E. Tex.) L.P. v. Avinger Timber, LLC, 386 S.W.3d 256, 262 (Tex. 2012) (stating\nthat ″if an appraiser utilizes improper methodology or misapplies established rules and principles, the resulting testimony is unreliable\nand must be excluded″ and concluding that expert’s testimony violated value-to-the-taker rule and was inadmissible), or because it is\nnot a proper subject of expert testimony, see United States v. Adams, 271 F.3d 1236, 1245 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding that expert testimony\nconcerning credibility is generally not an appropriate subject for expert testimony).\n17\n      In the 1999 article, the three reliability gates were labeled: foundational reliability, methodological reliability, and connective\nreliability. Because courts have used the term ″foundation″ broadly to encompass all three types of reliability and the foundation of an\nexpert’s opinion may be a methodology or reasoning, we have renamed ″foundational reliability″ as ″predicative reliability″ in this\nArticle. The phrase ″predicative reliability″ focuses better on the data, facts, and assumptions underlying an expert opinion.\n18\n     Weisgram v.

Thus, for example, while an expert’s overwhelming\nqualifications may bear on the reliability of his proffered testimony, they are by no means a guarantor\nof reliability. By the same token, a reliable opinion expressed by a genuinely qualified expert may not\nhelp the jury if it does not pertain to a fact at issue in the case. 30\n\nTexas courts use essentially the same trilogy of tests to analyze the admissibility of expert testimony.\n31\n   The Texas [*8] Supreme Court typically references relevance, rather than assistance to the jury, as\nthe third prong, but the Court has defined relevancy in this context as imposing an ″assistance to the\njury″ requirement. 32\n\nThis division into separate gates does run a risk: it may ″make[] the task of determining admissibility\nsound more mechanical and less judgmental than it really is.″ 33 But in fact, these gates are inextricably\n26\n     Hendrix ex rel.

While\nthe court undoubtedly reached the correct conclusion, it is worth noting that an opinion identifying a plausible cause of an injury is\ndifferent than an opinion identifying the most likely cause of an injury. Thus, the defense expert who is only testifying as to possible\ncauses does not have to provide a reliable basis for concluding that the identified cause is the most likely cause of the injury. But the\ndefense expert nonetheless needs a reliable basis for an opinion that another cause is plausible; otherwise, the expert is engaging in pure\nspeculation.\n38\n     For additional discussion of this gate, see Brown, supra note 1, at 757-72.\n\f                                                                                                                               Page 9 of 230\n                                                           52 Hous.

L. Rev. 1, *12\n\nIn its most recent opinion on qualifications, In re Commitment of Bohannan, the Court found that the\nexpert was qualified and the trial court erred in excluding the expert’s testimony. 56 In re Commitment\nof Bohannan, a case arising from the commitment of an individual deemed to be a sexually violent\npredator (SVP), held that an expert in an SVP proceeding does not have to be licensed as a physician\nor psychologist to be qualified. 57 The Court began with the ″general rule″ that ″an expert must be\nqualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to assist the trier of fact to understand\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue,″ and then stated that a witness’s expertise ″does not\nnecessarily mean that the witness can assist the trier-of-fact. Expert testimony assists the trier-of-fact\nwhen the expert’s knowledge and experience on a relevant issue are beyond that of the average juror\nand the testimony helps the trier-of-fact understand the evidence or determine a fact issue.″ 58 But that\nhelpfulness inquiry only begins the analysis. ″Credentials are important, but credentials alone do not\nqualify an expert to testify.″ 59\n\nReiterating Broders, the Court stressed that the expertise must concern the precise matter at hand. 60\nAs part of the qualifications issue, courts must also examine whether the expert’s testimony is reliable.\n61\n   The Court observed that a person’s mental health is part - but only part - of determining [*13]\nwhether a person is predisposed to sexually violent conduct, and that a factfinder must consider ″all\navailable information″ in making that determination. 62 In determining that issue, ″the kind of\nevaluation done by a psychologist may be at least as important as a medical diagnosis.″ 63\n\nThe usefulness of the expert’s opinion in assisting the trier-of-fact rests not on the type of license the\nexpert holds but on the expert’s knowledge, training, and experience in dealing with sexual offenders.\nA person’s training and experience in clinical interviews and actuarial tests is no less helpful merely\nbecause the person is not licensed as a psychologist. 64\n\nThe Court concluded that ″a person is not disqualified from testifying as an expert in an SVP\ncommitment proceeding merely because the person is not licensed as a physician or psychologist.″ 65\n\nIn re Commitment of Bohannan may be read to expand the issues involved in a qualifications inquiry.\nEven with the best of credentials, an expert may not be qualified to opine on a subject because the\ntechniques involved may not be reliable. On the other hand, an expert with less impressive credentials\n56\n     In re Commitment of Bohannan, 388 S.W.3d 296, 307 (Tex. 2012).\n57\n     Id. at 306.\n58\n     Id. at 304.\n59\n     Id.\n60\n     Id. at 305.\n61\n     Id.\n62\n     Id. at 305-06. The Court distinguished commitment proceedings, based on a person’s ″unsound mind″ from SVP proceedings, which\nexpressly did not require a showing of ″unsound mind.″ Id. at 303-04. The Court noted that the Legislature had expressly indicated ″that\nmedical and psychiatric testimony, a constitutional prerequisite for committing a person of unsound mind, is not necessary to SVP\nproceedings. Id. at 304.\n63\n     Id. at 306.\n64\n     Id.\n65\n     Id.\n\f                                                                                                            Page 12 of 230\n                                                    52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *13\n\nmay nevertheless be qualified if the expert’s technique used for reaching a conclusion is more\nimportant than the credentials. One federal court has likewise indicated that an expert’s qualifications\nare reviewed in the context of the opinion the expert offers. ″Shoddy preparation by an expert might\nevidence a lack of professional qualifications on the part of a proffered witness.″ 66\n\nFinally, like Helena Chemical, In re Commitment of Bohannan demonstrates the important role of\nissue-framing in assessing expert qualifications. The court of appeals had held in another SVP\nproceeding involving the same expert that the SVP statute contained two distinct issues: whether the\ndefendant has an acquired or congenital condition and whether the defendant has a predisposition to\ncommit a sexually violent offense. 67 The [*14] court of appeals held that medical evidence was\nnecessary to prove the first issue but not the second. 68 Thus, under the court of appeals’ construction\nof the statute, the expert, trained in applying actuarial tests evaluating the risk of recidivism and\nexperienced in identifying that risk among her patients, but not a medical doctor - was qualified to offer\nan opinion on the second issue but not the first. 69 The Texas Supreme Court rejected that ″bisection″\nof the statute, concluding that the statutory inquiry focused on whether the defendant has ″″a condition\nthat … predisposes’ sexually violent conduct,″ such that the conduct and predisposition could not be\nconsidered separately. 70 Under the Court’s single-issue approach, a nonphysician, nonpsychologist,\nlike the expert in In re Commitment of Bohannan, may be deemed qualified to offer all opinion\ntestimony on all necessary components of the statute. Conversely, under the court of appeals’\nbifurcated approach, medical expertise was necessary for the ″condition″ component of the statute. 71\n\nThe Court found experts to be unqualified in General Motors Corp. v.

Downing, a medical malpractice claim, the Court held that the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding a plastic surgeon as unqualified to testify on the standard of care for\na plastic surgeon. 79 The defendant-physician objected that the expert lacked experience with the\nprocedure the defendant-physician utilized. 80 The Beaumont appellate court found the expert qualified\nbecause he was a licensed physician with a board certification in plastic and reconstructive surgery and\nwas actively practicing medicine when the claim arose. 81 He also ″expressed knowledge of the\naccepted standards of medical care for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of the injury involved in the\nclaim.″ 82 The high court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and affirmed the trial court’s\nexclusion of the physician expert and entry of summary judgment. 83 Although the expert had a number\nof credentials, the Texas Medical Liability Act requires a court to consider whether the expert ″was\nactively practicing medicine in rendering medical care services relevant to the claim,″ and the expert\nhad not performed the surgery at issue in over fifteen years, and there was no evidence that he had ever\ntaught the procedure. 84 ″The trial court was well within its discretion in determining that [the expert]\nwas too far removed from surgical practice and even from teaching.″ 85 Whether to exclude the\nexpert’s testimony was a close call, and close calls must be left to the trial court. 86\nIn Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez, a products liability case, the Court applied the Broders rule\nthat experts must have expertise ″concerning the actual subject about which they are offering an\nopinion″ 87 to hold that the trial court should have excluded a chemist from opining on whether a tire\nhad a manufacturing defect. 88 In Broders, the Court observed that ″given the increasingly specialized\nand technical nature of medicine, there is no validity, if there ever was, to the notion that every licensed\nmedical doctor should be automatically qualified [*16] to testify as an expert on every medical\nquestion.″ 89 Cooper Tire applies the same principle to other highly specialized fields. 90 Though the\nexpert had a degree in chemistry, he had no specialized expertise in tire chemistry and never worked\n78\n     Id. The Iracheta Court went on to address the conclusory, self-contradictory nature of Sanchez’s testimony even after determining\nhe was unqualified to offer an opinion, echoing the implication in In re Commitment of Bohannan that the qualifications inquiry may\nimplicate not only the expert’s credentials but also his methods and analysis.

He also conceded that he did not\nconsider himself an expert in tire design or a forensic tire examiner, and did not hold himself out as\nhaving any expertise in the field of tire manufacturing. The Court found that he was not qualified to\ntestify on the subject of wax migration and contamination in tires and their effect on tire adhesion\nwithout more specialized education, training, or experience in tire chemistry. ″Chemistry is an\nexceedingly vast science divided into several branches and is far beyond the capacity of one person to\nmaster.″ 91\n\nIn re McAllen Medical Center, Inc. concerned whether a physician was qualified to testify in support\nof a negligent credentialing claim. 92 The Court held that she was not. 93 The Court initially noted that\n″a negligent credentialing claim involves a specialized standard of care.″ 94 Her curriculum vitae (CV)\nwas ″a model of brevity″: it did not list where she went to medical school, identify any details about\nher twenty years of practice, list any hospital where she was on staff, or identify any special knowledge\nregarding hospital credentialing. 95 Nothing in her CV, or anywhere else in the record, suggested she\nhad any [*17] special knowledge or expertise regarding hospital credentialing. 96 Therefore, the\noffering party failed to satisfy its burden of showing that she was qualified to testify about standards\nthat govern a hospital’s credentialing process. 97\n\nTo flesh out the qualifications inquiry mandated by Broders and Cooper Tire, civil cases might\nconsider adopting the Court of Criminal Appeals’ qualifications test. In criminal cases, ″qualification\nis a two-step inquiry″: the witness must ″have a sufficient background in a particular field,″ and the\nwitness’s background must ″go[] to the matter on which the witness is to give an opinion.″ 98 The first\ninquiry is more general in nature - such as examining whether an expert on medical issues is a\nphysician - while the second examines whether the expert has ″knowledge, skill, experience, training,\nor education regarding the specific issue before the court that would qualify the expert to give an\n91\n     Id. at 806. Here again, although the Court held that the expert was not qualified to offer an opinion, it discussed not only the expert’s\ncredentials but also the reliability of his opinion. Id. The Court noted that the expert opined that the wax on the skim stock identified\nin a report was the result of contamination rather than migration even though the authors of the report had concluded that they could\nnot determine whether migration was the source of the wax. Id. ″[He] also opined that the wax would adversely affect adhesion, though\nhe could not identify any testing [on the subject] and offered no testimony as to the amount of wax needed to cause a belt or tread to\nseparate.″ Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the Court did not state that the expert’s testimony was unreliable, it at least\nimplied that the reliability of the testimony was questionable. See id. at 806-07. Like Iracheta, Cooper Tire is consistent with the In re\nCommitment of Bohannan concept that the qualifications standards for experts may be something of a sliding scale, depending on the\nreliability of the testimony offered and how much of the reliability must be derived from his credibility as an expert in the field. At a\nminimum, courts may point to the unreliability of an expert’s opinion to buttress their conclusion that the expert lacks the necessary\nqualifications.\n92\n     In re McAllen Med.

The focus is on the fit between the subject matter at issue and the\nexpert’s familiarity with it.″ 99 As the Court of Criminal Appeals explained a year earlier,\n\n″fit″ is not just a component of reliability and relevance - it is also a component of the qualification\ninquiry. Just as the subject matter of an expert’s testimony should be tailored to the facts of a case, the\nexpert’s background must be tailored to the specific area of expertise in which the expert desires to\ntestify. 100\n\nAt least one opinion in a civil case has also used the fit requirement to mandate that the expert’s\nqualifications must match the precise question at hand:\n\nWhether a physician qualifies as an expert is determined by comparing the area in which the witness\nhas such knowledge, skill, experience, or training with the subject matter of the proposed testimony.\nThe focus is on the ″fit″ between the subject matter at issue and the expert’s familiarity of the subject\nmatter … . 101\n [*18]\n\nB. General Principles\n\nTurning from the holdings in these cases to general principles, courts should separately examine the\nexpert’s qualifications for each proffered opinion. 102 Courts do not examine ″whether an expert\nwitness is qualified in general, but whether [the expert’s] ″qualifications provide a foundation … to\nanswer a specific question.’″ 103 Thus, courts may find an expert qualified for one opinion, but not for\nanother. 104 And, as discussed above, how broadly or narrowly a court defines the ″specific question″\nat issue impacts what kind of qualifications the expert must possess. 105\n\n99\n     Id. at 813 (citations omitted). The qualifications standard is lower in criminal cases if the expert’s opinion ″is close to the jury’s\ncommon understanding″; conversely, the expert’s qualifications are more important ″when the evidence is well outside the jury’s own\nexperience.″ Rodgers v.

The proper\ninquiry in assessing a physician’s qualifications is not the physician’s area of practice but the\nphysician’s familiarity with the specific issues involving the claim. 127 A physician, therefore, does not\nneed to be a practitioner in the same specialty as the defendant health care provider. 128 The test is\nwhether the witness has ″knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education″ regarding the specific\n123\n      Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v.

L. Rev. 1, *25\n\nAs discussed below in the context of the reliability gates, 146 expert evidence is subject to two kinds\nof attacks in Texas: attacks on the admissibility of the evidence that must be raised before it is admitted\ninto evidence and attacks on the competency of the evidence which, in many circumstances, can be\nraised for the first time after the verdict. The Texas Supreme Court has never specified any limitations\non the applicability of the requirement that an objection was necessary to avoid waiver, but it also has\nnot explicitly considered an argument that objections to an expert witness’s qualifications do not have\nto be raised when the qualifications are described in a conclusory manner. In Nissan Motor Co. v.\nArmstrong, the Court declined to address a challenge to an expert witness’s qualifications when the\nopposing party’s pretrial motion to exclude the expert’s testimony ″asserted not that he was unqualified\nbut that his opinions were unreliable.″ 147 On this basis, the Court held that the party’s complaint about\nthe expert’s qualifications ″was not preserved for appeal.″ 148\n\nConsistently, several courts of appeals have stated that ″an objection to an expert’s qualifications must\nbe raised in the trial court in order to preserve error.″ 149 The courts of appeals have [*26] differed,\nhowever, on whether an expert’s qualifications to offer an opinion can be challenged on appeal in the\nabsence of a waiver when the qualifications-based challenge is combined with a challenge that the\nopinion offered is speculative or conclusory, which generally does not require an objection. One court\nheld that the qualifications challenge was waived while the conclusory challenge was not; 150 another\nconcluded that neither challenge is waived when they are combined. 151 The San Antonio Court of\nAppeals, over twenty years ago, described an opinion by an unqualified witness as incompetent, and\n\n146\n      See infra Part III.A.1-2.\n147\n      Nissan Motor Co. v.

Rev. 1, *26\n\ntherefore not evidence, thus obviating the need for a preverdict objection. 152 A few subsequent cases\nhave also found expert testimony to be incompetent based on lack of qualifications. 153\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has indicated that an objection raised in motion to exclude under\nDaubert/Robinson 154 may be sufficient to preserve a challenge to an expert’s qualifications, even if\nthe objection is not reiterated when the expert’s opinion is offered at trial. In Iracheta, the party whose\nexpert was [*27] challenged argued in the court of appeals that the opposing party waived any\nobjection to the expert’s qualifications by failing to object. 155 The court of appeals rejected this\ncontention, observing that the opposing party had filed a ″Robinson type″ motion to exclude the\nexpert’s testimony in which the party argued that the expert was unqualified to testify. 156 The Texas\nSupreme Court did not expressly address the question of waiver with respect to the qualifications-based\nchallenge to the expert testimony in Iracheta, but it too reached the issue, indicating that the issue was\nnot waived. 157 Courts of appeals have generally treated pretrial motions to exclude expert testimony\nas preserving error with respect to the objections raised in the motions. 158\n\nII. The Assistance and Relevancy Gates\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has frequently linked the requirement that expert evidence ″assist the trier\nof fact″ with the requirement that the evidence be relevant.

Helpfulness requires more than just a good ″fit″ between the expert evidence and\nthe issues in the case (which is required for relevance); the evidence must also be based on expertise\nbeyond the ken of the average juror. 161 Inversely, relevance requires more than just useful expertise;\nthe evidence must fit the legal and factual issues in the case. 162\n                                    163\nA.

Only one Texas Supreme Court case, K-Mart Corp. v. Honeycutt, 167 has focused on this\nrequirement. That does not mean helpfulness is not important. On the contrary, the entire reliability\ninquiry can be summarized with a helpfulness test: Does this particular expert testimony actually\nprovide the help a reasonable juror needs? 168 Expert testimony is permitted [*29] because of the\n161\n      See discussion infra Part II.A.\n162\n      See discussion infra Part II.B.\n163\n      For additional discussion of these issues, see Brown, supra note 1, at 751-57.\n164\n      Tex.

Zwahr. 223\n\n [*38] The sole issue in Zwahr was whether the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony\nregarding the value of land taken by eminent domain. 224 Exxon argued, and the Texas Supreme Court\nagreed, that the expert had impermissibly relied on the enhanced value a property would have after the\ncondemnation in determining the value of the plaintiffs’ land at the time of the taking. 225 Specifically,\nthe expert had testified that the area of land Exxon had condemned for its pipeline easement was a\nseparate economic unit, created and defined by the parameters of Exxon’s easement, with its ″highest\nand best use″ as a pipeline, and that the plaintiffs’ interest in the area condemned by Exxon was\n″negligible″ before Exxon’s project. 226 The Court held that the expert’s testimony violated the\n″project-enhancement″ rule, which prohibits the jury from considering any enhancement to the value\nof the landowner’s property that results from the taking itself, 227 and also failed to apply the\nhas placed ″renewed emphasis on the importance of the ″fit’ of an expert’s opinion to the data or facts in the case″ and that even when\nan opinion satisfies the Daubert factors, it is inadmissible ″if it does not apply to the specific facts of the case″). ″Including relevance\nin the gatekeeping inquiry reinforces … the importance of ensuring that the proffered opinion … is linked to the facts of the case.″ 2\nGoode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 702.6, at 63. The fit ″casts an additional spin to [the] relevancy analysis … .″ Id. As\nexplained by Professors Mueller and Kirkpatrick, ″the degree of ″fit’ between the proffered testimony and the facts and issues in the case\nis an aspect of relevancy.″ 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra note 187, § 7:10, at 787.\n222\n       In criminal cases - which are not our focus - relevance is often a determinative issue because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\nseveral years ago in Vela v. State identified relevance as one of ″three separate conditions″ that must be satisfied for expert testimony.\nVela v. State, 209 S.W.3d 128, 130-31 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (stating that the evidence rules ″require a trial judge to make three separate\ninquiries, which must all be met before admitting expert testimony: ″(1) the witness qualifies as an expert by reason of his knowledge,\nskill, experience, training, or education; (2) the subject matter of the testimony is an appropriate one for expert testimony; and (3)\nadmitting the expert testimony will actually assist the fact-finder in deciding the case.’ These conditions are commonly referred to as\n(1) qualification, (2) reliability, and (3) relevance″ (footnote omitted) (quoting Rodgers v. State, 205 S.W.3d 525, 527 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2006))). But see, e.g., Rosenfeld v. Oceania Cruises, Inc., 654 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir. 2011) (describing the third inquiry - assistance\nto the factfinder - as ″helpfulness″ rather than ″relevance″ (quoting United States v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2004))). The\nCourt of Criminal Appeals in Vela was summarizing the evidence rules implicated in expert challenges and specifically relied on Rule\n402 for this last ″condition.″ In explaining these rules, however, the Vela Court quoted from an opinion earlier that same year, Rodgers\nv. State, in which the Court stated that the third condition, relevance, examines whether the ″expert testimony will actually assist the\nfact-finder in deciding the case.″ Vela, 209 S.W.3d at 131 (quoting Rodgers, 205 S.W.3d at 527). Vela’s summary equates relevance with\nassistance. Rodgers relied solely on the text of Rule 702, which explicitly requires the expert testimony to ″assist the trier of fact to\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.″ Rodgers, 205 S.W.3d at 527 (quoting Tex. R. Evid. 702). Vela looked to both\nRule 402 and 702. Vela, 209 S.W.3d at 131. Thus, the Court conflated relevance and helpfulness, which are separate, though overlapping,\ninquiries. They overlap because evidence that is not relevant is not helpful to the factfinder in determining the issues in dispute. But they\ncan also be distinct: evidence may be relevant but excluded as unhelpful because the subject of the testimony is within the common\nknowledge of the jury and the expert offers no knowledge or insight beyond the jury’s purview. While the identification of the gates and\nthe terms differ, the Court of Criminal Appeals’ test does not alter the issues presented by expert testimony. For example, the Court has\nstated that the relevance inquiry examines both whether evidence ″will assist the trier of fact″ and whether it ″is sufficiently tied to the\nfacts of the case.″ Tillman v. State, 354 S.W.3d 425, 438 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011) (quoting Jordan v. State, 928 S.W.2d 550, 555 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The helpfulness requirement therefore is a hurdle for expert testimony in criminal\ncases in Texas, even if it is considered part of the relevance inquiry.\n223\n      Exxon Pipeline Co. v.

Rev. 1, *38\n\n″before-and-after″ valuation method, which dictates that the value of condemned land be measured by\nthe difference in the market value of the land immediately before and immediately after the taking. 228\nBecause of these flaws, the Court observed that, ″at best,″ the expert had ″determined the value of the\neasement to Exxon, not the value of the loss to the Zwahrs for the taking of the easement.″ 229 Thus,\nthe testimony ″was irrelevant to determining the value of the land taken from the [plaintiffs] and\ntherefore inadmissible under Texas Rule of Evidence 702.″ 230\n\nZwahr teaches that, to be relevant, expert testimony must fit not only the facts of the case but also the\napplicable legal parameters. 231 Ultimately, the test for relevance looks at the fit between the testimony\nand the issues the factfinder must decide, which will be determined not only by the factual disputes\nbut also by the relevant legal inquiries. For damages experts in particular, expert evidence that\nexamines the wrong measure of [*39] damages under the law, even if otherwise reliable and\napplicable, is neither relevant nor admissible. 232 Responsibility for ensuring that damages and other\nexperts offer opinions that are based on the proper legal standards falls primarily on the shoulders of\nthe proffering party’s attorney, who is the party’s legal expert. Practitioners thus must be careful to\noversee the work of retained experts to ensure that the evidence the expert provides is the kind of\nevidence that advances the client’s case - including ensuring that experts are using a legally correct\nmeasure of damages, are not relying on elements of damages that the law precludes, and do not\noverlook limitations and discounts that the law requires.\n\nIII. The Reliability Gates\n\nThe admissibility of expert opinion testimony is analyzed under a three-fold inquiry: whether the\nexpert opinion testimony will be helpful to the jury, whether the expert is qualified to offer the opinion\ntestimony, and whether the opinion testimony the expert offers is sufficiently reliable to be admitted.\n233\n    The inquiry into whether expert opinion testimony is sufficiently reliable also can be broken down\ninto three parts: predicative reliability, 234 methodological reliability, 235 and connective reliability. 236\n228\n       Id. at 627-28, 631. The case involved a partial taking, in which ″the before-and-after rule still applies, but compensation is\nmeasured by the market value of the part taken plus any diminution in value to the remainder of the land.″ Id. at 627.

It\nrequires that expert testimony (1) be ″based on sufficient facts or data″; (2) be ″the product of reliable\nprinciples and methods″; and (3) ″reliably apply the principles and methods to the facts of the case.″\n241\n    As summarized by the Fifth Circuit, trial courts act as ″gate-keepers″ by making a ″preliminary\nassessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid\nand of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.″ 242 This\nthree-fold inquiry applies to each step of [*41] the expert’s reasoning process.

Legal-Sufficiency Challenges to Expert Reliability\n\nOne key aspect of reliability challenges in Texas differs from most jurisdictions. Although federal\ncourts treat expert reliability almost exclusively as an admissibility issue, 252 Texas courts test\nreliability both at the admissibility stage (before or during trial) and at the\nlegal-sufficiency-of-the-evidence stage (after the close of evidence). This unique aspect of Texas law\nsprings from Havner. 253 When it first adopted and applied the U.S. Supreme Court’s Daubert analysis\nin Robinson, the Texas Supreme Court stated that Rule 702 governed the standard for the admission\nof scientific evidence. 254 The Robinson Court stated that the legal [*43] sufficiency of scientific\nevidence ″is outside the scope of Rule 702.″ 255 As in Daubert, the issue in Robinson was whether the\ntrial court erred in excluding expert testimony under Rule 702. 256 That same issue was presented to\nthe Texas Supreme Court in Havner. 257 But the petitioner in Havner also argued that the expert\ntestimony at issue was legally insufficient to support the verdict, and the Court decided the case under\nthe legal-sufficiency analysis rather than under an admissibility analysis. 258 The Havner Court applied\nthe Daubert/Robinson reliability standards to hold that, because the plaintiff’s expert evidence on\nwould accept it as useful and reliable [but it need not be conclusive because] medical knowledge is often uncertain. The human body\nis complex, etiology is often uncertain, and ethical concerns often prevent double-blind studies calculated to establish statistical proof.″).\n\n250\n      Anderson v. Griffin, 397 F.3d 515, 521 (7th Cir. 2005) (stating that defense expert’s testimony that accident was caused by ″road\njunk … was implausible; but that is not the test″ because ″events that have a very low antecedent probability of occurring nevertheless\ndo sometimes occur … and if in a particular case all the alternatives are ruled out, we can be confident that the case presents one of those\ninstances in which the rare event did occur″).\n251\n       Mack Trucks, Inc. v.

The Court noted in Robinson that it had addressed the legal sufficiency of scientific evidence in a\nprevious opinion: Duff v. Yelin. Id. In Duff, the court held that a trial court properly granted an instructed verdict in favor of a\nhospital-defendant because the plaintiff’s medical expert testified to one of two possible causes of the plaintiff’s injury and never stated\nthat one cause or the other was, in ″reasonable medical probability,″ a cause of the injury.

Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 582 (1993); Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 550.\n257\n      The first issue presented in the application for writ of error to the Texas Supreme Court in Havner was whether ″the court of appeals\nerred in affirming the trial court’s admission of unreliable and irrelevant causation evidence.″ Application for Writ of Error at X, Merrell\nDow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706 (Tex. 1997) (No. 95-1036), 1995 WL 17064851. Legal sufficiency of the evidence was\nthe second issue presented. Id.\n258\n       Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 709, 711, 713; see also Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596 (noting that even when expert evidence is admissible, the\ntrial court may conclude that it is legally insufficient evidence to create a question of fact and may grant a directed verdict or summary\njudgment).\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 35 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *43\n\ncausation was unreliable, it constituted no evidence and could not support the verdict for the plaintiff.\n259\n\n\n\nA year after Havner, the Court faced another legal-sufficiency challenge to expert testimony in\nMaritime Overseas. 260 But unlike Havner, the opposing party in Maritime Overseas had not objected\nto the experts’ testimony until after the jury verdict. 261 The Court held the opposing party had waived\nits [*44] complaint, stating broadly: ″To preserve a complaint that scientific evidence is unreliable and\nthus, no evidence, a party must object to the evidence before trial or when the evidence is offered.″ 262\n\nIf this had been the Texas Supreme Court’s last word on error preservation, the dual nature of expert\nchallenges in Texas courts would not be greatly distinguishable from expert challenges in other\njurisdictions. Although parties could challenge expert evidence on either admissibility or\nlegal-sufficiency grounds, they would have to raise any challenge before admission of the evidence,\nand offering parties would have an opportunity to cure defects. The principal difference between expert\nchallenges in Texas and those in other jurisdictions would be the availability of the less deferential\nde-novo standard of review available for legal-sufficiency challenges. 263\n\nBut that was not the Court’s last word. Six years later in Coastal Transport Co. v. Crown Central\nPetroleum Corp., 264 the [*45] Court recognized a significant exception to Maritime Overseas’s\n259\n      Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 730; see also Whirlpool Corp. v. Camacho, 298 S.W.3d 631, 643 (Tex. 2009).\n260\n       Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 409 (Tex. 1998) (″Here, like in Havner, Maritime contends that because Ellis’s\nscientific evidence ″is not reliable, it is not evidence,’ and the court of appeals and this Court are ″barred by the rules of law or of\nevidence from giving weight’ to Ellis’s experts’ testimony.″).\n261\n      Id. at 410. In Maritime Overseas, the plaintiff won a jury verdict on his claim that he suffered from acute and long-term effects\nfrom exposure to a chemical pesticide. Id. at 407. The defendant contended that the standards ″articulated in Robinson and Havner are\nthe proper standards for reviewing the sufficiency of [the plaintiff’s] damages evidence.″ Id. at 408. But the defendant did not challenge\nthe admissibility of the expert testimony nor contend that there was no evidence of any damages. Id. Rather, it argued that the evidence\nwas not reliable for demonstrating the claimed long-term damages and therefore ″would be legally insufficient″ if the court of appeals\nhad applied the proper standard for a factual-sufficiency review. Id.\n262\n       Id. at 409. The Court stated that to hold otherwise would be ″unfair″ because it would ″usurp the orderly and efficient disposition\nof appeals, deprive the proffering party of an opportunity to cure any defects in its evidence that the objecting party might pose,″ permit\ntrial or appeal ″by ambush,″ and ″in some cases, place appellate courts in the undesirable position of making decisions about evidentiary\nreliability absent a fully developed record.″ Id. at 409, 412. Then-Justice, now-Chief Justice, Hecht dissented from the pronouncement\nof this rule, stating:\nAs early as 1912, and as recently as last year, this Court has held that a party may complain after verdict and on appeal that evidence\nadmitted without objection is neither legally nor factually sufficient to support the verdict. The Court ignores a solid line of cases\nestablishing this principle with respect to all kinds of evidence, including scientific testimony. There is no authority for the Court’s\nholding that ″to preserve a complaint that scientific evidence is unreliable and thus, no evidence, a party must object to the evidence\nbefore trial or when the evidence is offered.″\n\nId. at 417 (Hecht, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).\n263\n       The standard of review for admissibility challenges is abuse of discretion, which sets a high bar for reversal. See, e.g., Mack Trucks,\nInc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 578 (Tex. 2006). The standard of review for legal-sufficiency challenges is de novo, which affords the\ntrial court little, if any, deference. See, e.g., FFE Transp. Servs., Inc. v. Fulgham, 154 S.W.3d 84, 89-90 (Tex. 2004).\n264\n      Coastal Transp. Co. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227 (Tex. 2004). In Coastal Transport, the Court held that expert\nopinion testimony on gross negligence was conclusory. Id. at 233. The plaintiff had asked its expert three questions regarding whether\nthe defendant’s conduct constituted gross negligence: (1) did it involve a high degree of risk; (2) did the defendant have ″actual subjective\nawareness of the risk″; and (3) did the defendant ″proceed with conscious indifference.″ Id. at 231. The expert answered each question\n\f                                                                                                                            Page 36 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *45\n\nobjection requirement: no preverdict objection is necessary when the expert evidence is ″conclusory\nor speculative and therefore non-probative on its face.″ 265 The Coastal Transport Court stated that\nchallenges to the reliability of an expert’s methodology, 266 technique, or foundational data 267 require\ncourts to look beyond [*46] the face of the record, and therefore require an objection; but challenges\nbased on the conclusory or speculative nature of expert testimony do not require courts to go beyond\n\n\n\n\naffirmatively but was not asked to explain the basis for his affirmative answer to each question. Id. at 231-32. In a postjudgment\nlegal-sufficiency challenge, the defendant argued that the testimony ″amounted to no more than a ″bare conclusion’ that was ″factually\nunsubstantiated’ and therefore constituted no evidence.″ Id. The Court agreed, and held that the conclusory testimony was ″mere ipse\ndixit,″ ″incompetent evidence,″ and ″not relevant.″ Id. at 232. Therefore, Maritime Overseas - which required an objection to expert\ntestimony - was inapplicable. Under Coastal Transport, no ″objection is needed to preserve a no-evidence challenge to conclusory expert\ntestimony.″ Id.\n265\n      Id. at 233. The Court explained that when the expert’s underlying methodology is challenged, a court must ″look[] beyond what\nthe expert said″ to evaluate the reliability of the expert’s opinion. Id. at 253 (quoting Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d\n706, 712 (Tex. 1997)).\n\nWhen the testimony is challenged as conclusory or speculative and therefore non-probative on its face, however, there is no need to go\nbeyond the face of the record to test its reliability. We therefore conclude that when a reliability challenge requires the court to evaluate\nthe underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made so that the trial court\nhas the opportunity to conduct this analysis. However, when the challenge is restricted to the face of the record - for example, when\nexpert testimony is speculative or conclusory on its face - then a party may challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence even in the\nabsence of any objection to its admissibility.\nId. at 233 (alteration in original).\nCoastal Transport backpedaled from Maritime Overseas’s objection requirement and adopted much of the dissent in that case. Of the six\ncases relied upon by the Court in Coastal Transport, four were cited by the Maritime Overseas dissent. See Mar. Overseas Corp., 971\nS.W.2d at 418, 420 (Hecht, J., dissenting). The Coastal Transport Court distinguished Maritime Overseas because the expert challenge\nthere addressed the expert’s methodology, ″an analysis that should [not] be undertaken for the first time on appeal.″ Coastal Transp., 136\nS.W.3d at 233. Relying on a quote from Maritime Overseas where the Court distinguished the ″non-probative″ value cases relied on by\nthe dissent, the Court held that an objection to expert testimony is unnecessary when the testimony is conclusory or speculative and\ntherefore is not probative on its face. Id. at 233; see also id. at 229. If the defect in the expert’s testimony is apparent on the face of the\nrecord, an objection to admissibility is not required. Id. at 229, 233 (recognizing a distinction between challenges to an expert’s scientific\nmethodology and ″no evidence challenges where, on the face of the record, the evidence lacked probative value″ (quoting Mar. Overseas\nCorp., 971 S.W.2d at 412)).\n266\n      Coastal Transp., 136 S.W.3d at 233 (″When the expert’s underlying methodology is challenged, the court ″necessarily looks beyond\nwhat the expert said’ to evaluate the reliability of the expert’s opinion.″ (quoting Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712)). The distinction between\na challenge to an expert’s methodology and a challenge that the expert testimony constitutes no evidence was recognized by the\nFourteenth Court of Appeals in Graves v. Tomlinson. Graves v. Tomlinson, 329 S.W.3d 128, 141 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2010,\npet. denied). When a legal-sufficiency challenge focuses in significant part on expert testimony, an appellate court ″must consider the\ndifference between (1) a challenge to an expert’s methodology; and (2) a legal sufficiency challenge predicated on a contention that an\nexpert’s testimony lacks probative value″ because ″these are two distinct inquiries.″ Id. In this divorce proceeding, the wife, as part of\nher legal-sufficiency challenge, argued that her former husband’s valuation expert used an unreliable methodology to determine the value\nof a community property. Id. at 140-41. Because the former wife did not object before or during trial to the expert’s valuation\nmethodology, she could not raise the issue on appeal. Id. at 146.\n267\n       Although this reference to ″foundational data″ appears to place inadequate predicative materials in the ″objection required″\ncategory, that is not always the case. As discussed in Part III.A and in Part III.B, below, when an expert fails to identify any basis for\nhis opinion, or when the basis the expert identified for his opinion does not actually support his opinion, the opinion is conclusory. For\nexample, as Havner and its progeny demonstrate, when an expert relies on epidemiological studies to support his causation opinion but\nthose studies do not actually support a causal relationship, the expert’s opinion is conclusory and constitutes no evidence. See infra notes\n633-61 and accompanying text.\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 37 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *46\n\nthe face of the record, and therefore do not require an objection. 268 As a result, a party can preserve\nerror regarding the reliability of expert testimony by raising the issue for the first time in postverdict\nlegal-sufficiency challenges, provided the testimony is deemed conclusory or speculative. 269\n\nAt the time, the Coastal Transport exception may have been viewed as a narrow one. 270 But in\nsubsequent cases, the Court [*47] has defined ″conclusory″ and ″speculative″ to incorporate a broad\narray of reliability challenges, and as a result, the Coastal Transport exception to Maritime Overseas’s\nobjection requirement has nearly swallowed the rule. 271 Thus, in Texas, appellate challenges to expert\nevidence are routinely raised and decided under a legal-sufficiency rubric, not the admissibility rubric.\nThe distinction between these is key to determining when and how a party opposing expert opinion\nevidence must raise challenges to the reliability of the evidence, and it shapes the nature of appellate\ncourt review of expert testimony in Texas.\n268\n      Coastal Transp., 136 S.W.3d at 232-33; see also City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d 809, 817 (Tex. 2009) (quoting Coastal\nTransp., 136 S.W.3d at 233). The Coastal Transport Court stated, ″When the testimony is challenged as conclusory or speculative and\ntherefore non-probative on its face, however, there is no need to go beyond the face of the record to test its reliability.″ Coastal Transp.,\n136 S.W.3d at 233.\n269\n      Coastal Transp., 136 S.W.3d at 233 (″We therefore conclude that when a reliability challenge requires the court to evaluate the\nunderlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made so that the trial court has\nthe opportunity to conduct this analysis. However, when the challenge is restricted to the face of the record - for example, when expert\ntestimony is speculative or conclusory on its face - then a party may challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence even in the absence\nof any objection to its admissibility.″ (alteration in original)). Coastal Transport, thus, raised the stakes when the issue on appeal is\nwhether expert testimony can be labeled conclusory. See Professor Goode’s criticism of Coastal Transport in infra notes 469-72 and\naccompanying text.\n270\n       The unanimous holding in Coastal Transport was supported by strong precedent. See, e.g., Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712; Dall. Ry.\n& Terminal Co. v. Gossett, 294 S.W.2d 377, 380-81 (Tex. 1956). The Texas Supreme Court had previously found expert testimony\nconclusory and no evidence in summary judgment proceedings and in trial. It did so in the summary judgment context in Burrow v. Arce,\n997 S.W.2d 229, 235 (Tex. 1999), and Anderson v. Snider, 808 S.W.2d 54, 55 (Tex. 1991) (per curiam). In Schaefer v. Texas Employers’\nInsurance Ass’n, the basis for the expert’s trial causation opinion had no evidentiary support and therefore, his causation testimony was\n″mere possibility.″ Schaefer v. Tex. Emp’rs’ Ins. Ass’n, 612 S.W.2d 199, 204 (Tex. 1980). Similarly, in Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye,\na jury verdict was reversed because the opinion of the plaintiff’s treating physician had no factual basis and therefore, was no evidence\ndespite the absence of any objection to his opinion. Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499 (Tex. 1995). The dissent in\nMaritime Overseas relied on both Schaefer and Burroughs. Mar. Overseas Corp., 971 S.W.2d at 419-20 (Hecht, J., dissenting). Neither\nis discussed in Coastal Transport. But in all of these cases, the expert opinion was without support on its face; the Court did not review\na stated basis for the opinion and decide that it failed to actually support the opinion.\nAfter Maritime Overseas, and before Coastal Transport, many courts had refused to entertain legal-insufficiency challenges to expert\ntestimony when Robinson-type ″admissibility″ objections were not made before or during trial. See, e.g., Cass v. Stephens, No.\n08-97-00582-CV, 2001 WL 28092, at 17 (Tex.

L. Rev. 1, *47\n\n1. Preservation of Error. For purposes of challenging the reliability of expert evidence, the primary\nprocedural distinction between admissibility challenges and legal-sufficiency challenges is in how a\nparty preserves an objection to expert evidence. The rules for preserving a reliability-based challenge\nto the admissibility of expert evidence are well established. A party must raise reliability objections -\nwhich are distinct from qualifications objections and must be separately preserved 272 - [*48] before\nthe evidence is admitted and obtain a ruling from the trial court. 273 The objection is frequently made\npretrial through a motion to exclude or strike expert testimony. 274 But a party should be cautious about\nrelying exclusively on a pretrial motion because the expert’s trial testimony may differ from the pretrial\ndisclosures. 275 ″[A] careful party will urge its objections both before trial and re-urge them when the\n\n\n\n272\n      A qualifications objection does not preserve a reliability challenge. United States v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 75-76 (1st Cir. 2002) (″Rule\n702 encompasses an array of expert witness issues … . Diaz’s general references at trial to Daubert or competency, particularly in light\nof a pretrial challenge limited to the qualifications of the experts, was woefully deficient for the purpose of advising the district court\nthat Diaz was raising a challenge to the reliability of the expert’s methods … .″); Nissan Motor Co. v. Armstrong, 145 S.W.3d 131, 143-44\n(Tex. 2004) (finding pretrial motion to exclude the expert’s opinions because of lack of qualifications did not preserve objection that his\nopinions were unreliable); Schindler Elevator Corp. v. Anderson, 78 S.W.3d 392, 404 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet.\ngranted, judgm’t vacated w.r.m.) (holding that pretrial motion that focused on expert’s qualifications did not preserve objection to\nreliability of testimony and stating that ″objections to qualifications are thus distinct from objections about reliability″), abrogated by\nRoberts v. Williamson, 111 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. 2003); cf. Quiet Tech. DC-8, Inc. v. Hurel-Dubois UK Ltd., 326 F.3d 1333, 1341 (11th Cir.\n2003) (noting that although qualifications, reliability, and helpfulness objections may overlap to some degree, they ″are distinct concepts\nthat courts and litigants must take care not to conflate″); Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth. v. Kraft, 39 S.W.3d 264, 266 (Tex. App. - Austin\n2001) (finding error was preserved to expert testimony on market value of easement when the appellant objected that the expert’s\nmethodology did not meet the reliability standards articulated by Gammill, and stating that ″this objection adequately informed the trial\ncourt to rule on the reliability of [the expert’s] methodology and hence, its admissibility″), rev’d, 77 S.W.3d 805 (Tex. 2002). Similarly,\na reliability objection does not preserve a qualifications objection. Kroger Co. v. Betancourt, 996 S.W.2d 353, 360-61 (Tex. App. -\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied) (holding that Kroger’s objection that the expert’s opinion was speculative and not reliable did\nnot preserve any error based on lack of qualifications).\n273\n     See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 818; Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Helton, 133 S.W.3d 245, 251-52 (Tex. 2004), abrogated by Coastal Oil &\nGas Corp. v. Garza Energy Trust, 268 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. 2008); Mar. Overseas Corp., 971 S.W.2d at 409; Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth.,\n77 S.W.3d at 807.\n274\n      A pretrial motion to strike will generally be sufficient to preserve error for a challenged expert opinion. Fleming v. Kinney ex rel.\nShelton, 395 S.W.3d 917, 926 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied) (observing that a motion to exclude expert testimony\nwas sufficient to preserve issue); Marvelli v. Alston, 100 S.W.3d 460, 470 n.3 (Tex. App. - Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied) (noting that\na pretrial ruling is sufficient to preserve the error); Huckaby v. A.G. Perry & Son, Inc., 20 S.W.3d 194, 203-04, 206 (Tex. App. -\nTexarkana 2000, pet. denied). A motion in limine will not preserve error unless the content of the motion makes it clear that the party\nis seeking the exclusion of expert testimony. Brookshire Bros. v. Smith, 176 S.W.3d 30, 35 n.3 (Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 2004,\npet. denied) (finding a motion in limine preserved error because it sought to exclude expert testimony); Huckaby, 20 S.W.3d at 203-04\n(explaining difference between motions in limine and motions to exclude).\n275\n      David F. Johnson, Appellate Issues Regarding the Admission or Exclusion of Expert Testimony in Texas, 52 S. Tex. L. Rev. 153,\n186 (2010) (″If a party solely relies on a pretrial motion to preserve error, it should take great caution to foresee all objectionable bases\nand to assert them. Otherwise, the party will not be able to allege an objection that was not expressly raised in the pretrial motion or\nraised at trial.″). Stated differently, a pretrial objection to the reliability of expert testimony must encompass all of the expert challenges\nthat are raised in the appeal; a trial court generally cannot be reversed for an evidentiary objection that was never presented or an\nobjection for which no ruling was obtained (unless the evidence is legally ″no evidence″). In Nip v. Checkpoint Systems, Inc., the\nappellant raised six separate challenges to the reliability of the expert’s testimony. Nip v. Checkpoint Sys., Inc., 154 S.W.3d 767, 771\n(Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.). The appellee contended that the points were waived because they were not part of the\nbasis for the challenge in the trial court. Id. at 770-71. The court of appeals held that it first had to ″determine whether appellants have\npreserved each of their six contentions″ by raising them in their motion to strike the expert in the trial court. Id. at 771. Finding that only\none of the six arguments had been raised below, the court found the other five points were waived. Id.\n\f                                                                                                                            Page 39 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *48\n\nevidence and any similar [*49] evidence is offered at trial and obtain a ruling.″ 276 A single objection\nat trial will sometimes preserve error, 277 but not always. A running objection will preserve error, if\nmade appropriately. 278 When a party timely objects to the admissibility of expert evidence on\nreliability grounds and is overruled, the party has preserved the right to appeal the trial court’s decision\nto admit the evidence. 279 A party who fails to object to the admissibility of expert testimony cannot,\nhowever, cure the lack of objection through cross-examination or controverting expert testimony. 280\n\nThe rules for preserving a reliability-based challenge to the legal sufficiency of expert evidence,\nhowever, are less clearly defined. Outside the context of expert evidence, a legal-sufficiency challenge\nmay be raised for the first time after the trial court signs a judgment. 281 But many jurisdictions have\n [*50] considered challenges to expert opinion evidence only with respect to admissibility objections,\n\n276\n      Johnson, supra note 275, at 186-87.\n277\n       The normal rule is that a party must object to evidence each time it is offered. Austin v. Weems, 337 S.W.3d 415, 421 (Tex. App.\n- Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (″Any error in the admission of evidence is waived if the objecting party subsequently permits the\nsame or similar evidence to be introduced without objection. Thus, a party fails to preserve error if it does not object to the same or similar\nevidence that is offered by the opposing party.″ (citation omitted)). In Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority v. Kraft, the Court stated that\n″a party must object to the testimony before trial or when it is offered.″ Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth., 77 S.W.3d at 807. In that case\nthe party made the objection when the witness began testifying. Id. ″After voir dire, the trial court overruled the objection.″ Id. David\nJohnson interprets this case as holding that ″[a] clear objection at the beginning of the expert’s testimony does preserve error.″ Johnson,\nsupra note 275, at 191. Whether an objection in the middle of the expert’s direct examination would fall under this rule is unclear. David\nJohnson states that it will: ″An objection in the middle of the expert’s testimony, before the objectionable matter is offered, will be\nsufficient to preserve error.″ Id. He relies on In re Estate of Robinson. Id. In that case, the party made a motion to exclude the expert\nbefore the first trial and renewed its motion to exclude in the middle of the direct examination in the second trial. In re Estate of Robinson,\n140 S.W.3d 782, 789 (Tex. App. - Corpus Christi 2004, pet. denied). Because the party did not merely object, but made a motion to\nexclude, the precedential value of that case may be limited. A party would be wise to make a pretrial motion to exclude at trial, or, better\nyet, a pretrial motion to exclude with a running objection at trial. But see Tex. R. Evid. 103(a)(1) (stating that ″when the court hears\nobjections to offered evidence out of the presence of the jury and rules that such evidence be admitted,″ it is unnecessary to repeat the\nobjection)\n278\n      Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d 897, 907 (Tex. 2004) (″Because [the party’s] initial objection to the evidence\ncomplied with Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 33.1(a) and its requested running objection clearly identified the source and specific\nsubject matter of the expected objectionable evidence prior to its disclosure to the jury, recognition of the running objection for more\nthan one witness was appropriate.″).\n279\n      See Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 716, 718-19 (Tex. 1998).\n280\n      City of San Antonio v.

Circle C Drilling Co., the Texas Supreme Court observed that\nno evidence points must be preserved through one of the following procedural steps in the trial court: (1) a motion for instructed verdict;\n(2) a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; (3) an objection to the submission of the issue to the jury; (4) a motion to disregard\nthe jury’s answer to a vital fact issue; or, (5) a motion for new trial.\nAero Energy, Inc. v.

Although the Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly\nidentified these five procedures as the proper means for preserving a no-evidence complaint, it is possible that a party may be able to\npreserve such a complaint in another form of postjudgment motion, such as a motion to modify the judgment, if the substance of the\nmotion is to the same effect as a motion for JNOV or a motion to disregard a jury finding.

Blackwood,\n41 S.W.3d 123, 126-27 (Tex. 2001).\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 40 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *50\n\n282\n    which must be raised prior to admission of the evidence. Because Texas courts allow both types of\nchallenges (legal-sufficiency and admissibility) to the reliability of expert opinion evidence, a question\narises about when an objection to the reliability of expert evidence must be raised before the evidence\nis admitted and when it can be raised for the first time postverdict.\n\nOver the last fifteen years, the answer to this question has largely come down to whether the evidence\nis categorized as ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″ and therefore, ″non-probative on its face.″ If it is, no\npreverdict objection is required; if it is not, then failure to object before the expert is admitted waives\nthe complaint. Determining whether expert evidence is ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″ is thus a critical\nissue for parties offering or opposing expert evidence in Texas. This issue is discussed in the next\nsection. 283\n\n2. When Is Opinion Evidence ″Conclusory″ or ″Speculative″? Objections to the admissibility of\nevidence must be raised before the evidence is admitted, but Texas courts have long allowed late\nchallenges to incompetent evidence. 284 Any unreliable expert opinion is inadmissible and thus subject\nto an admissibility objection before or at trial. But only ″conclusive″ or ″speculative″ expert opinions\nare incompetent such that an objection can be raised for the first time postverdict. 285 Because a\nconclusory [*51] objection can be raised postverdict even if the opinion was admitted without\nobjection, it is important to define when an opinion is conclusory. But it is sometimes difficult to draw\na line between conclusory expert testimony, and expert testimony that is unreliable but not conclusory\nor speculative. ″Some objections will fall close to the line″ between evidence that is conclusory and\nevidence that is unreliable but not conclusory. 286 Because of these uncertainties, the best rule of\npractice from an appellate standpoint is to object to the witness’s opinion testimony both before trial\nand during trial.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has struggled with trying to find a middle course that simultaneously allows\nlegal-sufficiency challenges but also prevents appeals on issues never raised before the trial court - that\nis, ″appeal by ambush.″ 287 And this struggle not only impacts legal-sufficiency challenges, but also\nmay impact factual-sufficiency challenges; arguably a factual-insufficiency challenge could incorporate\nan argument raised for the first time postverdict that the expert’s opinion is conclusory or speculative.\nThus, when a claim or defense is supported by other evidence (and therefore, a successful challenge\nto the expert’s opinion cannot result in a legal-sufficiency challenge), the conclusory objection may\n282\n      See cases cited infra note 458.\n283\n      See discussion infra Part III.A.2.\n284\n      City of Keller v.

A principal basis the Texas Supreme Court has used to identify ″conclusory″ expert\ntestimony is whether the expert has identified the basis for his opinion or whether the jury essentially\nmust take the expert’s word for it. 288 Thus, the Court held in Burrow v. Arce, City of San Antonio v.\nPollock, and [*52] Elizondo v. Krist that expert testimony was conclusory because the expert\nessentially asked the jury to ″take my word for it.″ 289 Conversely, in Arkoma Basin the Court held that\nexpert testimony was not conclusory because the expert ″did not simply state a conclusion without any\nexplanation, or ask jurors to ″take my word for it.’″ 290 And in General Motors Corp. v. Sanchez, 291\na products liability suit, the Court rejected a challenge to the speculativeness of expert testimony\nbecause the expert offered ″more … than [his] bald assertion that his design would be safer.″ 292 The\nexpert had described the product’s operation ″at length, and explained in some detail how his proposed\ndesign would make the transmission safer,″ 293 and his ″testimony about the engineering principles\nunderlying his proposed design supported his conclusion.″ 294\n\nThe applicability of the ″baseless″ and ″ipse dixit″ labels has evolved over time. Even before Robinson\nand Havner, the Court held ″conclusory statements made by an expert witness are insufficient to\nsupport summary judgment.″ 295 Initially, this rule of law was applied to preclude a judgment entered\nin reliance on an expert opinion for which the expert provided no basis or explanation whatsoever,\ninstead merely stating an opinion. 296 But beginning in Havner, 297 the rule began to expand to include\nopinion testimony for which an expert offered some basis or [*53] explanation, but the explanation\n288\n      Elizondo v.

The Havner Court stated that an expert’s ″bare\nopinion″ does not constitute evidence, and to determine whether it qualifies as evidence ″the substance\nof the testimony must be considered.″ 298 To begin with, an expert’s ″bald assurance of validity is not\nenough… . The underlying data should be independently evaluated in determining if the opinion itself\nis reliable.″ 299 Additionally, an appellate court looks ″at the testimony in its entirety,″ because ″to\naccept the expert’s opinion as some evidence ″simply because he used the magic words’ would\neffectively remove the jurisdiction of the appellate courts to determine the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence in any case requiring expert testimony.″ 300\n\nThe Court stated in Burrow v.

Snider, Burrow\ninvolved the legal sufficiency of an attorney’s expert affidavit to support a judgment in a legal\nmalpractice action. 302 In Burrow, a well-qualified lawyer stated in a summary judgment affidavit that\nthe plaintiffs were ″reasonably and fairly compensated″ in their settlements in the underlying claim. 303\nUnlike the attorney in Anderson, the expert expressly identified the basis for his conclusion: the\navailable elements of damages, the losses suffered [*54] by each plaintiff, and the liability facts. 304\nBut the affidavit did not ″explain why″ those three factors supported his conclusion; it was therefore\nconclusory. 305 An expert ″cannot simply say, ″Take my word for it … .’ Credentials qualify a person\nto offer opinions, but they do not supply the basis for those opinions.

The Court explained:\n\nIt could be argued that looking beyond the testimony to determine the reliability of scientific evidence is incompatible with our no\nevidence standard of review. If a reviewing court is to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the argument runs,\na court should not look beyond the expert’s testimony to determine if it is reliable. But such an argument is too simplistic. It reduces\nthe no evidence standard of review to a meaningless exercise of looking to see only what words appear in the transcript of testimony,\nnot whether there is in fact some evidence.\nId. at 712. Whether expert testimony ″rises to the level of evidence is determined under our rules of evidence, including Rule 702, which\n… offers substantive guidelines in determining if the expert testimony is some evidence of probative value.″ Id. Thus, while Robinson\nconcerned admissibility, the Havner Court held that its ″factors may be applied in a no evidence review of scientific evidence.″ Id. at\n714.

In 2004, when the Court held in Coastal Transport that a legal-sufficiency\nchallenge to conclusory or speculative expert evidence could be raised on appeal despite the lack of\na preverdict objection, 313 it did so in reliance on this precedent, holding that the expert opinion\nevidence in the case constituted the expert’s ″bare conclusions″ or ″mere ipse dixit.″ 314 After Coastal\nTransport, however, the use of the terms ″conclusory″ and ″speculative″ continued to expand.\n\n\n307\n      Id. at 235.\n308\n      Id. at 236.\n309\n      See Anderson v.

While\nthe Romero court did not use the word conclusory, its reference to ″the mere ipse dixit of a credentialed witness″ shows that it treated\nthe opinion as such.

Ramirez. 318 These\nopinions refined the application of the ″conclusory″ label to expert evidence in an important way by\nholding that the expert opinions in those cases were speculative or conclusory, and therefore no\nevidence, because they failed the analytical gap test - i.e., they lacked connective reliability. 319 The\n [*56] holdings in Burrow and Ratliff set the stage for this aspect of the ″conclusory″ definition when\nthey stressed the need for an opinion witness to ″explain why″ and ″link his conclusions to the facts.″\n320\n    Since Kerr-McGee and Ramirez, expert testimony that is unreliable due to a lack of connective\nreliability has been frequently treated as conclusory or speculative, such that it cannot support a\njudgment even if admitted without objection. 321\n\nIn 2009 the Texas Supreme Court decided City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 322 in which it held that there\nwas no evidence that the Pollocks’ daughter contracted a particular form of leukemia as a result of\nbenzene exposure from a closed landfill located near the Pollocks’ home. 323 The Court held that the\nexperts’ causation opinions were conclusory and that this defect had not been waived by the city’s\nfailure to raise it in a pre-admission objection. 324 The Court held that the causation opinion offered\nby the Pollocks’ first expert, Kraft, suffered a fatal ″analytical gap″ and was conclusory because it was\nbased on exposure levels that the expert failed to tie back to the Pollocks’ exposure levels. 325 The\n315\n      The ″analytical gap″ test is the fundamental test for connective reliability. The parameters of this test are discussed in greater detail\nin the ″connective reliability″ section below.

Based on this alone, he opined that that the Pollocks were\nexposed to benzene concentrations of 160 ppb. Id. The Court rejected this testimony because the evidence of the gas concentration in\nthe sealed monitoring well near the Pollocks’ property did not support an opinion that the gas concentration would be the same in the\nambient air on the Pollocks’ property.

L. Rev. 1, *56\n\nCourt held that the causation opinion offered by the Pollocks’ second expert, Dr. Patel, was also\nconclusory because there was a ″large gap″ between the plaintiffs’ claimed exposure levels and the\nexposure levels found to have [*57] caused the disease in question in the literature relied on by the\nexpert. 326\n\nJustice Medina dissented in Pollock, joined by Justice O’Neill. The dissent observed that an objection\nis generally ″required to preserve error regarding the admission of evidence, and expert testimony is\nno exception.″ 327 The reason is simple: ″Without an objection, a trial court simply cannot be expected\nto fulfill its role as gatekeeper. Nor can an appellate court assume this role, particularly after the\nwitnesses have testified, been dismissed, and the record closed.″ 328 According to Justice Medina,\nunreliability caused by analytical gaps does not render opinion testimony conclusory and should also\nrequire a trial objection. 329 Relying on Arkoma Basin, Justice Medina argued the difference is\n″between something and nothing.″ 330 ″An expert’s testimony is [treated as] conclusory if the expert\nmerely gave an unexplained conclusion or asked the jury to ″take my word for it’ because of his status\nas an expert.″ 331 But, for Justice Medina, the opinion is not conclusory ″if the expert purports to rely\non something more than his credentials or reputation.″ 332\n\nThis complaint is, in part, why some commentators disfavor Texas’s legal-sufficiency review of expert\nevidence, as discussed in the next section. 333 But the Pollock standard prevailed and has [*58] been\nlargely unquestioned in Texas law for the last five years. 334 The Court recently reaffirmed Pollock’s\napplication of the ″analytical gap″ test to legal-sufficiency challenges in Elizondo v. Krist, holding that\nwho was a treating pediatric oncologist. The Court held his testimony was conclusory under the ″analytical gap″ test discussed above.\nId.\n326\n      Additionally, none of the literature in the record supported the expert’s assertion that ″long-term exposure to a low level of toxin\nmight″ cause the disease. Id. at 819-20. Finally, all the epidemiological studies on the disease did not satisfy the Havner standards for\ncausation evidence in a toxic tort case. Id. at 820.\n327\n      Id. at 822 (Medina, J., dissenting).\n328\n      Id.\n329\n      Id. at 823.\n330\n       Id. Justice Medina stated that the Pollocks’ experts did not ″ask[] the jury to trust their opinion merely on the basis of their\nexpertise. They instead purported to analyze″ the data underlying their opinion. Id. at 828. Thus, the city’s ″complaints about analytical\ngaps [are] nothing more than an unpreserved reliability challenge. Analytical gaps are not complaints about naked opinions, lacking any\nbasis in the record, but rather are assertions that specific errors or omissions in an expert’s analysis render his or her opinion unreliable.″\nId. He concluded:\nThe Court’s opinion today unfortunately blurs the distinction between expert testimony that purports to have a basis in science (unreliable\nexpert testimony) and expert testimony that lacks any apparent support apart from the expert’s claim to superior knowledge (conclusory\nexpert testimony). The Court’s decision today is not only wrong, it is also unfair and may encourage gamesmanship in the future. Why\nhave a pretrial Robinson hearing or make a reliability objection during trial and run the risk that the proffering party may fix the problem,\nwhen the expert’s opinion can be picked apart for analytical gaps on appeal?\n\nId. at 828-29 (footnote omitted).\n331\n      Id.\n332\n      Id. at 824.\n333\n      See infra Part III.A.5.\n334\n      See, e.g., Elizondo v.

The Robinson Factors. 336 In Havner, the Texas Supreme Court stated that, although Robinson\naddressed the admissibility of expert evidence, ″the Robinson factors″ may be applied in a no evidence\nreview of scientific evidence. 337 But after Havner, the Court did not rely on the Robinson factors in\na legal-sufficiency review for nearly a decade. In 2006, the Texas Supreme Court began incorporating\nthe Robinson factors in legal-sufficiency reviews of expert evidence again, further broadening the\napplicability of the ″conclusory or speculative″ label. In Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez 338 and\nMack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 339 both products liability cases, the Court utilized the Robinson factors\nin holding that an expert’s opinion was speculative and therefore no evidence. 340 In both cases, the\nCourt determined that the expert’s testimony lacked connective reliability. 341 But because the Court\nreviewed the experts’ [*59] methodology in reaching that determination, Cooper Tire and Mack\nTrucks indicate that a lack of methodological reliability can contribute to a lack of connective\nreliability, resulting in ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″ expert testimony.\n\nThe Court reaffirmed this principle in Whirlpool Corp. v. Camacho, 342 when it applied the Robinson\nfactors to hold that expert opinion testimony was conclusory and therefore not entitled to probative\nweight. 343\nIf Cooper Tire and Mack Trucks indicate that methodological and connective reliability are\noverlapping and may combine to render evidence conclusory or speculative, then Whirlpool indicates\nthat methodological and predicative reliability are overlapping and the former may combine to render\nevidence conclusory or speculative.

L. Rev. 1, *62\n\nconfirms Havner’s rule that the Robinson factors may be raised for the first time in a postverdict\nlegal-sufficiency challenge. 353\n\nd. Nonprobative Predicates. 354 In City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 355 the Court defined ″conclusory″\nexpert evidence to include not only when ″no basis for the opinion is offered″ but also when ″the basis\noffered provides no support″ for the opinion. 356 The Court formulated the test this way:\nWhen a scientific opinion is admitted in evidence without objection, it may be considered probative\nevidence even if the basis for the opinion is unreliable. But if no basis for the opinion is offered, or\nthe basis offered provides no support, the opinion is merely a conclusory statement and cannot be\nconsidered probative evidence, regardless of whether there is no objection. 357\n\n[*63] The Court’s most recent expert decision, Houston Unlimited, Inc. Metal Processing v. Mel Acres\nRanch, quoted and reaffirmed Pollock’s definition of ″conclusory,″ explaining that the rationale for this\nrule is that ″the evidentiary value of expert testimony is derived from its basis, not from the mere fact\nthat the expert has said it.″ 358\nThe conclusory nature of the expert testimony in Pollock arises largely under the ″analytical gap″ test\ndiscussed above. But the Pollock Court’s definition of conclusory, and particularly its rejection of Dr.\nPatel’s opinion testimony, underscored that a ″gap″ can arise not just from an expert’s failure to\nlogically connect supporting data to his conclusion (a connective reliability issue 359), but also from\nan expert’s connection of his conclusion to data that simply does not support the conclusion (a\npredicative reliability issue 360). Dr. Kraft’s testimony fit squarely in the first category, 361 but Dr.\nPatel’s testimony also fit into the latter. Dr. Patel’s opinion essentially fell short in the same way that\nthe expert opinions in Havner fell short: he cited studies and articles but they did not tend to prove a\ncausal connection between the Pollocks’ level of benzene exposure and birth defects. Thus, Pollock\nliterature. Similarly, predicate data is often part of the record and therefore may be reviewed postverdict. See infra notes 404-05 and\naccompanying text for a discussion of this distinction.

In holding that an\nobjection was necessary to preserve the expert opinion challenges in Maritime Overseas, the Court\nthere distinguished Havner on the ground that the party opposing the expert testimony in Havner had\ntimely objected to the testimony. 362 But Pollock may be read to suggest that Havner would have come\nout the same way even in the absence of an objection.\nThe year after Pollock, the Court issued two more opinions holding that expert opinion testimony on\ncausation was conclusory because, while the experts explained the basis for their opinions, ″the basis\noffered provided no support″ 363 for their conclusions. 364 Both of these cases were products liability\n [*64] cases in which the expert’s causation opinion was predicated on facts that were equally\nconsistent with alternative theories of causation; the predicates thus failed to tend to prove the expert’s\ncausation theory was more likely than the alternative causation theories.\n\nIn the first of these, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 365 the plaintiffs’ expert theorized that a house\nfire was most likely caused by the explosion of a halogen bulb in a lamp purchased at Wal-Mart, which\nsent ″burning glass shards onto″ a nearby recliner, where the shards ″smoldered for several hours″ and\nthen grew into a fire. 366 The Wal-Mart expert, on the other hand, concluded that ″the more likely cause\nof [the] fire was careless disposal of smoking materials.″ 367 Wal-Mart argued that the plaintiffs’ expert\ntestimony constituted no evidence of causation because it ″lacked factual substantiation,″ and the Texas\nSupreme Court agreed. 368 The Court noted that the plaintiffs’ expert had ruled out smoking materials\nas the cause of the fire because there was no evidence of burnt cigarettes near the recliner, but there\nwas ″no evidence of charred or exploded glass″ near the recliner either. 369 The Court held that,\nbecause the plaintiffs’ expert failed to ″explain or adequately disprove alternate theories of causation,″\nhis own theory was ″speculative and conclusory.″ 370\nMore damaging to the reliability of the plaintiffs’ expert than his failure to discredit opposing causation\ntheories was his failure to provide support for his own ″specific causation theory.″ 371 Although he had\ndemonstrated generally the dangers of halogen lamps and the possibility that a fire could be ignited by\nthe explosion of a halogen bulb, the Court concluded that ″evidence that halogen lamps can cause fires\n\n\n362\n      Mar.

Rev. 1, *64\n\ngenerally … does not establish that the lamp in question caused this fire.″ 372 The [*65] Court thus\nconcluded that there was no evidence of causation, and Wal-Mart’s failure to object to the reliability\nof the expert testimony was not fatal. 373 The underlying defect in the plaintiffs’ expert’s testimony in\nMerrell was that the facts on which the expert based his causation conclusion (his predicate) were\nequally consistent with the alternative causation theories espoused by the opposing party’s expert. This\nshows how a lack of predicative reliability can result in a lack of connective reliability - i.e., an\nanalytical gap. An expert’s efforts to ″connect″ her conclusion to a factual or scientific predicate cannot\nsucceed when the predicate does not, in fact, logically support the expert’s conclusion.\n\nThe Court applied the same principle in Jelinek v. Casas, a medical malpractice case in which the\nplaintiff asserted that the hospital’s failure to administer antibiotics caused an infection. 374 The\nplaintiff’s expert conceded that the circumstantial evidence supporting his causation opinion was\n″equally consistent″ with two other theories of causation - neither of which could be attributed to the\nnegligence of the hospital. 375 ″When the facts support several possible conclusions, only some of\nwhich establish that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiff’s injury,″ the Court stated, ″the\nexpert must explain to the factfinder why those conclusions are superior based on verifiable medical\nevidence, not simply the expert’s opinion.″ 376\n\nApplying the equal inference rule, the Jelinek Court explained that it was ″equally plausible that [the\npatient] had [an anaerobic] infection or that she did not. [The expert] opined that she did, but he did\nnot explain why that opinion was superior to the opposite view. Such evidence raises no more than a\npossibility of causation, which is insufficient.″ 377 The expert also relied on evidence of a foul smell,\na finding consistent with an anaerobic infection, to support his opinion that she suffered from an\nundetected anaerobic infection. 378 The hospital, however, [*66] offered other explanations for the\nsmell. 379 Because the evidence included ″competing explanations for the smell″ and only ″meager″\ncircumstantial evidence, the jury would be compelled to speculate and ″could not reasonably infer an\ninfection caused by the Hospital’s negligence.″ 380 In short, in the same way that a jury may not\nreasonably infer one fact over the other from evidence that is equally consistent with either, 381 an\nexpert may not draw one conclusion over the other from predicate data that is equally consistent with\neither.\n372\n      Id.\n373\n      Id.; Merrell v.

Rev. 1, *66\n\nThe Court recently explained the rule as follows: ″When the facts support several possible conclusions,\nonly some of which support the expert’s conclusions, the expert must explain to the factfinder why\nthose conclusions are superior based on verifiable evidence, not simply the expert’s opinion.″ 382 The\nCourt explained the rationale for rejecting conclusory expert testimony:\n\nThe law requires experts to substantiate their opinions, and for good reasons. Experts who testify on\nbehalf of parties to a lawsuit are subject to biases and potential abuses that are not always present\noutside the courtroom, and the courtroom itself may afford experts a veneer of credibility not present\nin other contexts. Legal sufficiency review requires courts to ensure that a jury that relies on an\nexpert’s opinion has heard factual evidence that demonstrates that the opinion is not conclusory on its\nface. Here, [the expert’s] reliance on insufficient data and unsupported assumptions and the analytical\ngaps in her analysis render her opinion conclusory and without evidentiary value. 383\n\ne. Predicates Without Evidentiary Support. 384 Shortly after Coastal Transport another kind of\n″conclusory″ opinion came into focus: opinions based on facts or assumptions that lack evidentiary\nsupport. 385 In 2005, the Court issued its magnum opus on the standards of evidentiary review: City\nof Keller v. [*67] Wilson. 386 Under City of Keller, if an expert’s opinion is incompetent - for whatever\nreason - no objection is necessary. 387 The Court observed in City of Keller that contrary evidence may\n″render[] supporting evidence incompetent.″ 388 ″Incompetent evidence [does not] support a judgment,\neven if admitted without objection.″ 389 As an example of incompetent expert testimony, the Court\nnoted that when ″an expert’s opinion is based on certain [factual] assumptions,″ other evidence may\ndemonstrate that those ″assumptions were unfounded,″ making the opinion unreliable. 390 Thus, an\nappellate court conducting a no-evidence review cannot consider only an expert’s bare opinion, but\nmust also consider contrary evidence showing it has no scientific basis. 391\n\nf. Conclusion. The Texas Supreme Court treats expert testimony as conclusory or speculative, such that\nno objection is necessary to preserve error, when (1) the expert fails to provide any explanation or\n382\n      Hous.

One expert may testify that X caused the plaintiff’s injuries while\na different expert may testify that X did not cause the plaintiff’s injuries. The factfinder typically lacks the expertise necessary to form\nan opinion without expert assistance - this is why expert testimony is admitted in the first place. It is the expert’s explanation of ″how’\nand ″why’ causation exists that allows the factfinder to weigh the credibility of the expert’s opinion and, when expert opinions conflict,\nto decide which testimony to disregard″).\n\nA jury cannot evaluate the basis of an expert’s opinion, for example, when the expert claims to rely on general scientific principles like\nthe laws of physics or general principles of a field such as engineering. See Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d 897, 905-06\n(Tex. 2004) (holding that expert’s incantation of ″basic scientific and some engineering principles″ and ″reliance on the ″laws of physics’,\nwithout more, is an insufficient explanation″).

Standards of Review. Evidentiary and legal-sufficiency challenges are subject to different standards\nof review and procedural rules. 396 Generally, a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude testimony,\nincluding expert testimony, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but legal-sufficiency challenges are\nreviewed de novo. 397 When the reliability of expert testimony is challenged [*70] in a\nlegal-sufficiency review, however, the applicable standard of review is less clear because the appellate\ncourt may be performing the same type of analysis it would apply in a challenge to the admissibility\nof the expert evidence.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court’s opinion in Whirlpool Corp. v.

A legal-sufficiency review\nconsiders only questions of law - whether there is a complete absence or no more than a scintilla of\nlegally competent evidence to support a vital fact or whether the evidence conclusively establishes the\nopposite of a vital fact 401 - and questions of law are reviewed de novo even under an\nabuse-of-discretion standard. 402\n4. Developing a Record. While Texas courts recognize that a party proffering expert evidence has the\nburden of establishing the reliability of the evidence, they have reached different conclusions about the\nparameters of that burden. In the context of an expert’s predicative materials, 403 Texas courts disagree\nabout when and to what extent a proffering party must include the expert’s predicative materials in the\n399\n      Id. at 637-38. Whirlpool argued that the court of appeals erred by ″applying an abuse of discretion rather than a ″de novo-like’\nreview″ in analyzing Whirlpool’s challenge to the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ only causation evidence: the testimony of an expert.\nId. Without explicitly stating that the applicable standard of review is ″de novo,″ the Texas Supreme Court stated:\nGenerally, rulings on objections as to admissibility of evidence, including whether expert testimony is reliable, are reviewed for abuse\nof discretion. But a party may assert on appeal that unreliable scientific evidence or expert testimony is not only inadmissible, but also\nthat its unreliability makes it legally insufficient to support a verdict.\nUnlike review of a trial court’s ruling as to admissibility of evidence where the ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion, in a no-evidence\nreview we independently consider whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to reach the verdict.\n\nId. at 638 (citations omitted). In performing its legal-sufficiency review, the Court made no mention of discretion in, or deference to,\nthe trial court. Id.\n400\n       Id. at 638. Before Whirlpool, the Amarillo, Fort Worth, and Texarkana Courts of Appeals had applied ″an almost de novo-like\nreview″ when a no-evidence challenge is combined with a challenge to the reliability of expert testimony. See, e.g., Gross v. Burt, 149\nS.W.3d 213, 237 (Tex. App. - Fort Worth 2004, pet. denied); Couch v. Simmons, 108 S.W.3d 338, 342 (Tex. App. - Amarillo 2003, no\npet.); Austin v. Kerr-McGee Ref.

L. Rev. 1, *71\n\nrecord, when and what objections are necessary to preserve a challenge, and how to handle predicative\nmaterial that is otherwise inadmissible. These issues are complicated by differences in the types of\nevidence on which an expert may rely and in the types of reliability challenges that may be raised in\nTexas, where reliability attacks can come in the form of before-the-fact challenges to the admissibility\nof the evidence or after-the-fact challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury\nverdict.\n\nWhether a challenge to expert evidence will fail or succeed frequently depends on the nature of the\ncomplaint, what is in the record, what is not in the record, and who bears the burden of creating the\nrecord. This is particularly true in a legal-sufficiency challenge, which, as discussed above, is limited\nto the ″face of the record.″ 404 The Court’s ″face of the record″ reviews are sometimes [*72] based\non the content of the expert’s predicative facts, data, or studies. 405 This raises questions about when\npredicative material must be put in the record and who bears the burden of creating that record. Both\nthe Federal and Texas Rules of Evidence expressly permit an expert to testify as to his opinion and give\nhis reasons for the opinion without first disclosing the underlying facts or data on which the opinion\nis based. 406 And both rules note that the expert may nevertheless be required to disclose the underlying\nfacts or data on cross-examination. 407 The Texas Rule expressly contemplates that the expert may be\nrequired to disclose underlying material on direct examination. 408\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court held that the expert testimony in Pollock was conclusory by examining the\npredicative studies the expert relied on to determine whether they provided any support for the expert’s\ncausation opinion. 409 It is not clear what the Court would have done if the studies identified by the\nexpert as supporting his conclusion had not been in the record, although it seems unlikely that the\nabsence of predicative studies in the record would convert an expert opinion from ″no evidence″ into\n″some evidence.″ 410 But in Arkoma Basin, 411 in addition to [*73] challenging the expert’s\nmethodology for determining the value of the plaintiffs’ mineral interests, the defendant objected that\n404\n      See supra notes 265, 268-69, 290, 352 and accompanying text.\n405\n      In Pollock, for example, the Court rejected expert testimony that exposure to benzene had caused plaintiffs’ daughter, Sarah, to\ndevelop leukemia in utero. City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d 809, 815-16 (Tex. 2009). The defendant did not contest that\nexposure to benzene could cause leukemia; only specific causation - whether benzene exposure had actually caused Sarah’s leukemia\n- was challenged. Id. at 818; see also infra notes 604-07 and accompanying text (discussing general and specific causation). The Court\nreviewed the studies relied on by the plaintiffs’ expert, observing that the studies recognized that the causal connection between benzene\nand chromosomal aberrations was ″clearly dose dependent″ and none of the studies showed chromosomal aberrations resulting from\nbenzene exposure of ″less than 10 ppm - more than 60 times″ Sarah’s level of exposure. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 819 (footnotes omitted).\nThe Court thus concluded that the studies relied on by the expert did not support his conclusion that Sarah’s low-level benzene exposure\ncaused her chromosomal aberrations. Id. Under the Pollock Court’s earlier preservation-of-error analysis, then, the expert’s basis did\n″not, on its face, support the opinion.″ Id. at 817.\n406\n      Fed. R. Evid. 705; Tex. R.

See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 818. Otherwise, at least in the absence of an\nobjection, a plaintiff’s expert who puts no predicative materials into the record would be better off than one who put some predicative\nmaterials into the record, because the Court would be unable to review the materials to determine whether they actually supported the\nexpert’s conclusion. But only a year before Pollock, the Court said in Arkoma Basin that ″experts are not required to introduce such\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 57 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *73\n\nthe foundational data on which the expert relied was not in the record. 412 Specifically, the expert\ntestified that he had run price projections to yield the prices he used to calculate damages, but neither\nthe projections nor the underlying data used in the runs was in the record. 413 The Court held that the\nproponent of the evidence was not required to identify or put into the record the underlying data,\nstating that ″experts are not required to introduce such foundational data at trial unless the opposing\nparty or the court insists.″ 414\n\nTexas courts of appeals are split on whether a party must introduce, or at least put into the record,\nfoundational data on which the party’s expert relied. The Texarkana Court of Appeals stated in\nMinnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. Atterbury that when a party’s expert relies on a study, the\nparty must ″identify the study, get it admitted into evidence, and explain how the methodology of the\nstudy is scientifically reliable. An [*74] error in any of the preceding steps will likely result in the\nstudy not being considered by a reviewing court.″ 415\nfoundational data at trial unless the opposing party or the court insists.″ Arkoma Basin Exploration Co. v. FMF Assocs. 1990-A, Ltd.,\n249 S.W.3d 380, 389-90. At least to some degree, this statement conflicts with the implication that when an expert offers into evidence\nno foundational material to support his or her opinion, the opinion is nonprobative and can be challenged even in the absence of an\nobjection by the opposing party. See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 823-25 (Medina, J., dissenting) (discussing Arkoma Basin and arguing that\nthe challenge to the plaintiff’s expert testimony should have been treated as an attack on methodology that had to be raised by objection).\nAlong these lines, it could be argued that an objection that the expert’s testimony is conclusory - which was the objection made in Pollock\n- notifies the opposing party and trial court under Rule 705(a) that the party is ″insisting″ on the underlying evidence being presented.\nUnder this interpretation, a party challenging expert testimony that the expert states is supported by data not part of the record should\nobject that the opinion is conclusory (thereby arguably invoking Rule 705(a)’s provision that a party may insist on the underlying data);\nto do so may cause the opinion to be treated as having no basis under Pollock rather than having a basis that is not in the record under\nArkoma Basin.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the identification of studies that are not in the record provides ″some explanation″ of the basis of the\nopinion. If the plaintiff in Pollock had merely recited the studies but the studies had not been made part of the trial record, would it have\nprevailed under the reasoning of Arkoma Basin? Justice Brister, the author of Arkoma Basin, while sitting on the Fourteenth Court of\nAppeals, once ordered the parties in a case involving the benzene scientific issues at issue in Pollock to supplement the record on appeal\nwith literature relied on by the experts even though it was not part of the trial record. See Exxon Corp. v. Makofski, 116 S.W.3d 176,\n183 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied). Pollock also suggests that an objecting party should probably consider putting\nany studies relied upon by the expert in the record if the studies clearly do not support the expert’s opinion. If the studies’ significance\nare debatable, the party faces the more difficult question of whether it is better to have the studies omitted from the record, and to argue\nthat under Texas law the absence of the studies makes the opinion ipse dixit and without any factual basis.\n411\n      Arkoma Basin, 249 S.W.3d at 380.

Laerdal Medical Corp., in which\nthe husband and son of a woman who died of cardiac failure alleged that her death was caused by a\ndefective automatic external defibrillator (AED) manufactured by one of the defendants. 416 In\nreaching his conclusion, the plaintiffs’ causation expert relied extensively on statistical data relating to\nsuccess rates for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in combination with electronic defibrillation. 417 The\ncourt of appeals noted the sources of the data were not included in the expert’s report ″for purposes\nof corroboration.″ 418 ″Without this information,″ the court stated, ″a reviewing court cannot accurately\nassess the reliability of [the expert’s] theories″ and is instead ″left to simply take [the expert’s] word\nfor the theories espoused in his testimony and report - something we cannot do.″ 419\n\nIn rejecting expert testimony that lacked an adequate predicate in Brookshire Bros., Inc. v.

The dissent stated, ″To the extent that [the\nplaintiff’s] experts relied upon epidemiological studies to prove″ causation, ″they made no effort to\nshow that the studies demonstrated a doubling of the risk that was statistically significant at the 95%\nconfidence [*76] level,″ as required by Havner. 427 ″In the absence of that evidence,″ the dissenting\njustice concluded, ″their opinions are unreliable and, legally, no evidence.″ 428\n\nSimilarly, in Pink v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the Beaumont Court of Appeals reversed a summary\njudgment in favor of Goodyear after concluding that the plaintiff’s expert evidence was not conclusory\ndespite the absence of predicative materials in the record, with one justice dissenting. 429 The plaintiff’s\nexpert, an oncologist, concluded that exposure to benzene at Goodyear’s tire plant caused the\nplaintiff’s renal cell carcinoma based on the expert’s review of the plaintiff’s medical records, witness\ntestimony asserting use of benzene at the plant, the deposition of another physician, and ″scientific\nliterature.″ 430 The two-justice majority held that the oncologist’s affidavit was not conclusory, even\nthough it did not disclose the specific scientific literature the oncologist consulted or disclose the\ncontents of the relied-upon literature, because the affidavit ″implicitly″ asserted that the scientific\nliterature review supported the oncologist’s conclusion. 431 Citing Texas Rule of Evidence 705(a), the\ncourt indicated that reliance on unspecified scientific literature was permissible under Rule 705(a) in\npart because the trial court had not entered any ″ruling requiring disclosure of the scientific literature\nor benzene exposure evidence on which the treating oncologist relied.″ 432 The chief [*77] justice\ndisagreed, concluding in his dissent that the oncologist’s affidavit was conclusory and therefore, could\n425\n      BNSF Ry.

The court also held that the lack of a Robinson hearing record and the failure to obtain an explicit ruling was fatal to\nthe expert challenge on appeal. Id. at 301-02. A ruling sustaining the defendant’s reliability ″objections to the causation opinion is not\nimplicit″ in the trial court’s order granting summary judgment and did not preserve error because the trial court could have granted\nsummary judgment on two other grounds urged in the trial court - no duty and no breach of a duty. Id. at 300. The court was also troubled\nabout attempting to rule on reliability without a record of the hearing because two different standards of review are implicated in an\nexpert challenge in the summary judgment context: abuse of discretion for an evidentiary objection based on lack of reliability and legal\nsufficiency for the summary judgment. Id. If the abuse of discretion standard is applied to the evidentiary issue,\n\nthis approach would reduce the summary judgment appellate review standard to an abuse of discretion standard whenever\ncase-determinative Robinson objections, coupled with a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, are considered implicitly sustained\nby the granting of summary judgment. Whether or not the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the Robinson objections would\nbe determinative on appeal of whether the summary judgment must be reversed or affirmed.\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 60 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous.

Flores, even if there was evidence that benzene exposure can cause\nrenal cell carcinoma at some exposure level, the plaintiff had failed to present evidence of what that\nexposure level is and whether the plaintiff had that level of exposure. 434\n\nIn the view of the Authors of this Article, Schronk, Minnesota Mining, and Brookshire Bros. are more\nconsistent with Texas Supreme Court authority reviewing expert evidence than Pink and BNSF. It is\nworth noting that the Texas Supreme Court denied the petitions for review in Schronk, Minnesota\nMining, and Brookshire Bros. The Supreme Court has not had an opportunity to review Pink or BNSF.\nAfter Goodyear filed a [*78] petition for review in Pink, the Court requested a response to the petition\nfor review and later full briefing on the merits. 435 But the parties settled the case and dismissed the\nappeal before full briefing was completed. 436 BNSF is pending before the Texas Supreme Court. 437\n\nReading Arkoma Basin in concert with Pollock, we conclude that the Texas Supreme Court is likely\nto treat the burden of placing predicative expert materials into the record much like it treated the\npreservation of error issue. Challenges to the soundness or trustworthiness of predicative material -\nsuch as an argument that a medical study was the product of a flawed methodology - must be raised\nbefore the trial court admits the expert opinion based on that material. 438 But challenges to the\n\nId.\nAnother problem is that Robinson hearings can include live testimony but summary judgment hearings cannot. Id. at 301. The court\nstated:\nConsidered with notice and opportunity-to-be-heard principles, these differences require that the two proceedings be separate under the\ncircumstances of this case, and that we not consider [the defendant’s] reliability objections as implicitly sustained by the trial court…\n. By conducting a separate Robinson hearing before considering a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, the trial court applies the\nprocess applicable to each hearing, provides the parties notice and an opportunity to present the best available evidence, and provides\nthe appellate court with a full record for review. That process is required here… . The process missing from this appellate record, and\nnecessary in this case, is a Robinson hearing. If the trial court decides the affidavit must be stricken because of unreliable foundational\ndata, methodology, or technique, or for some other reason, the trial court may then decide whether to grant the no-evidence summary\njudgment, or ″order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such\nother order as is just.″ Without an express ruling that the treating oncologist’s causation opinion is unreliable, however, the treating\noncologist’s affidavit remains part of the summary judgment proof and provides some evidence to defeat the no-evidence motion for\nsummary judgment on causation.\nId. at 301-03 (citations omitted).\n433\n      Id. at 303 (McKeithen, C.J., dissenting) (″Benzene exposure may or may not be a known cause of renal cell carcinoma, but Dr.\nKanojia’s affidavit neither states that benzene exposure is a known cause of renal cell carcinoma nor explains how Dr. Kanojia’s training\nand experience enable him to express an opinion regarding whether benzene causes renal cell carcinoma.″).\n434\n        Id. at 304 (citing Borg-Warner Corp. v.

If an expert’s\nopinion is admitted into evidence without objection and there is no challenge to the predicative\nmaterials on which the expert relied, it is our position that the court must take the predicative materials\nin the record at face value - i.e., presume them to be trustworthy. 439 But if the predicative materials\nin the record do not support the expert’s conclusions, the expert’s opinion will not stand up on review,\nregardless of whether an objection was made. If the predicative materials are not in the record at all,\nthey cannot be reviewed to determine whether they actually support the expert’s opinions, even if the\nmaterials are presumed to be trustworthy.\n\n [*79]   The proffering party thus likely bears the burden of creating a record to support expert\ntestimony, regardless of whether an objection was made. 440 But if the probative value of the predicate\nis evident on the face of the expert’s testimony, the absence of the predicative materials from the record\nwill not be fatal. This approach is consistent with both opinions. In Arkoma Basin, because the Court\ntreated the numbers on which the damages expert relied as trustworthy, the expert’s damages testimony\nwas not devoid of support. 441 The probativeness of those numbers was evident from the expert’s\ncalculations, which were in the record from the expert’s testimony and exhibits. 442 Thus, the expert’s\nopinion was reliable. But in Pollock, the expert’s testimony on causation was devoid of support even\nif the studies on which he relied were trustworthy because the studies did not support (i.e., were not\nprobative of) a causal connection. Thus, the expert’s opinion was unreliable regardless of whether the\nstudies were in the record.\n\nFinally, if the connection between the predicative material and the expert’s conclusions is not facially\nevident - a ″connective reliability″ issue, discussed in detail below 443 - the offering party probably\nbears the burden of creating a record to support the connection in order to establish that the expert’s\nconclusion has evidentiary weight, even in the absence of an objection.\n\nIn discussing the development of the record to support expert testimony, we must consider one last\nprocedural difference between a legal-sufficiency review and a review of the admission or exclusion\nof evidence. In the context of a legal-sufficiency review, the Texas Supreme Court has instructed courts\n\n439\n        Predicative Probativeness″ is discussed in the section on ″Predicative Reliability″ below. See infra notes 550-59 and accompanying\ntext.\n440\n       For example, the Court’s statement in Havner that ″to survive legal sufficiency review″ on causation, ″a claimant must do more\nthan simply introduce into evidence epidemiological studies that show a substantially elevated risk,″ implies that the claimant must at\nleast introduce such studies into evidence. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 720 (Tex. 1997).\n441\n        Arkoma Basin Exploration Co., Inc. v. FMF Assocs. 1990-A, Ltd, 249 S.W.3d 380, 389-90 (Tex. 2008).\n442\n        Id. at 389.\n443\n        See infra Part III.D.\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 62 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *79\n\nto review the ″entire record″ in analyzing the reliability of expert testimony. 444 This means two things\nwith respect to including predicative expert materials in the record. First, supportive materials included\nin the record will be considered by the court and thus may add to the expert’s reliability; supportive\nmaterials not included in the record offer no value beyond that [*80] afforded to the expert’s ability\nto rely on the materials, if any. 445 And if supportive predicative reliability materials are not included\nin the record but the opposing party includes in the record predicative material favoring a contrary\nconclusion, the expert’s opinion may be deemed unreliable. For instance, the Waco court in Schronk\nrejected the expert’s conclusion that the failure of the AED caused the death in part because the\nstatistical data the expert referenced (but did not include in his report) was contradicted by an American\nHeart Association report that was included in the record. 446 Thus, regardless of whether an offering\nparty must ensure that an expert’s predicative materials are included in the record as part of the burden\nto establish reliability, the offering party should do so as a practical matter.\n\nIn developing a record, parties must be cognizant of the distinction between exhibits and testimony\noffered at trial and exhibits and testimony offered at a pretrial Daubert hearing. In Exxon Corp. v.\nMakofski, the dissenting justice would have concluded that a party waived its challenge to the\nreliability of the predicate for the opposing party’s expert’s causation opinion by failing to obtain a\nrecord from the pretrial hearing on the motions to exclude the expert’s testimony. 447 In an opinion\nwritten by former Texas Supreme Court Justice Brister, then sitting on the Fourteenth Court of Appeals,\nthe court rejected the waiver argument, noting that ″following this argument to its logical conclusion,\nevery time a pretrial motion to strike expert testimony is denied without a reporter’s record, we must\npresume any jury verdict thereafter is valid (no matter how scientifically unsound).″ 448 The court\nstated that a record of the pretrial hearing would be necessary to review a challenge to the trial court’s\ndecision to admit the expert evidence, but it was not necessary to a challenge to the legal sufficiency\nof the evidence to support the jury verdict. 449\n\nOne other issue is whether the opposing party might want to offer the predicate materials relied on by\nthe opposing expert. An opposing party might consider offering (at least into the record for appellate\npurposes) portions of the expert’s materials if the materials do not in fact support the opinion. For\nexample, in [*81] Makofski, the expert relied on articles that did not reach the conclusion cited by\nthe expert. 450 On the other hand, if the party offering the testimony has the burden to offer the\npredicate materials, the party might not want to include them in the record if the study does not directly\nand clearly contradict the expert’s opinion.\n444\n      Whirlpool Corp. v. Camacho, 298 S.W.3d 631, 638 (Tex. 2009) (″[A] no-evidence review encompasses the entire record, including\ncontrary evidence tending to show the expert opinion is incompetent or unreliable.″).\n445\n      Courts of appeals routinely consider the contents of supportive materials introduced into evidence or filed with the expert’s opinion\nor with Daubert-related filings.\n446\n      Schronk v.

L. Rev. 1, *81\n\nFinally, different considerations come into play when an expert’s predicative material is of a kind that\nis generally inadmissible, such as hearsay. 451 Under both Federal and Texas Rules of Evidence, an\nexpert may rely on facts or data that are not themselves admissible into evidence as long as they are\nthe kinds of facts or data on which experts in the field would reasonably rely. 452 Likewise, both the\nFederal and Texas Rules provide that when the underlying material would otherwise be inadmissible,\nthe material may not be admitted into evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value\nas explanation or support for the expert’s opinion. 453 The Texas Rule further provides that such\nmaterial must be excluded ″if the danger that [it] will be used for a purpose other than as explanation\nor support for the expert’s opinion outweighs [its] value as explanation or support″ and requires the\ntrial court to give a limiting instruction if so requested. 454\n\nThe Texas Rules recognize a partial exception to the general prohibition on hearsay for learned\ntreatises relied on by an expert witness. 455 Rule 803(18) states,\n\nTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the\nexpert in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on\na subject of history, medicine, or other science or art established as a reliable authority by the testimony\nor admission of the witness or [*82] by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. If admitted, the\nstatements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits. 456\n\nOne Texas intermediate appellate court held the statements read into evidence pursuant to this Rule are\nafforded the same weight as live expert testimony and has considered them in reviewing reliability-based\nchallenges to expert testimony despite their exclusion from the jury room. 457 Thus, proponents of\nexpert opinions which rely on learned treatises should employ Rule 803’s limited hearsay exception\nfor learned treatises and have relevant portions read into evidence, even if the treatises cannot be\ntreated as exhibits when the jury retires to deliberate.\n\nRule 803(18) highlights the distinction between admitting predicate materials and including statements\nfrom those materials in the record. That Rule prohibits the admission of learned treatises as an exhibit\n451\n       The materials offered by the expert are hearsay if they are offered for the truth of the matters asserted in the material. But a party\ncould offer the materials for a nonhearsay basis: to demonstrate the predicate for the opinion. In that situation, they are offered only to\nshow what the expert relied on, not to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Thus, a trial judge might not admit the materials even for\nthis limited purpose under Rules 403 and 705(d). Tex. R. Evid. 403, 705(d).\n452\n      Fed. R. Evid. 703; Tex. R. Evid. 703.\n453\n      Fed. R. Evid. 703; Tex. R. Evid. 705(d). While the Texas Rule requires ″exclusion″ of such evidence, the Federal Rule only\nprohibits disclosure of such evidence to the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 703; Tex. R. Evid. 705(d).\n454\n      Tex. R. Evid. 705(d). The Federal Rules have been read to similarly require a limiting instruction. See, e.g., Pineda v. Ford Motor\nCo., 520 F.3d 237, 247 n.14 (3d Cir. 2008); see also Fed. R. Evid. 105.\n455\n      Tex. R. Evid. 803(18).\n456\n      Id.\n457\n       See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp. v.

Practitioners who are concerned\nthat offering extensive predicate material will detract from the merits of their presentation, but likewise\nare concerned that expert opinions may be deemed unreliable or conclusory in the absence of such\nmaterials, would be wise to include the key statements from those materials in the record before the\nconclusion of the expert’s testimony.\n5. Commentary. Courts in many jurisdictions have declined to require an adequate basis and\nexplanation as a prerequisite to affording expert testimony evidentiary value, and even substantive\ncomplaints about the reliability of expert testimony cannot be raised for the first time in a\nlegal-sufficiency challenge in most jurisdictions. 458 Permitting legal-sufficiency attacks [*83] based\non the reliability of expert testimony, as Texas courts do, increases the burden on parties proffering\nexpert testimony in several ways. First, it gives the opposing party a second bite at the apple. An\nopposing party who has waived some or all challenges to the admissibility of expert evidence may still\nbe entitled to raise those challenges in a postverdict attack. With respect to reliability challenges the\nopposing party raised but did not prevail on at the Daubert hearing, the nonproffering party has an\nopportunity to further develop those challenges based on [*84] what occurred at the Daubert hearing\nand at trial. Second, because a legal-sufficiency challenge takes place after the close of evidence, the\n458\n       See Skydive Ariz., Inc. v. Quattrocchi, 673 F.3d 1105, 1113 (9th Cir. 2012) (″Failure to raise a Daubert challenge at trial causes\na party to waive the right to raise objections to the substance of expert testimony post-trial.″); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d 438,\n460 n.8 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that party could not complain on appeal that expert opinion lacked foundation because he stipulated to\nthe admission of the opinion); United States v. Havvard, 260 F.3d 597, 601 (7th Cir. 2001) (rejecting argument that trial court erred in\nadmitting conclusory expert testimony because ″Rule 705 … allows experts to present naked opinions″ and stating that ″uncovering the\nbasis for that opinion was a matter for cross-examination″ (quoting Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exch. Nat’l Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339\n(7th Cir.1989))); Macsenti v. Becker, 237 F.3d 1223, 1233-34 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding that defendant could not challenge the reliability\nand helpfulness of plaintiff’s expert testimony without having objected to the testimony when it was admitted at trial) C.B.

Everest Minerals Corp., 362 F.\nSupp. 2d 814, 821 (W.D. Tex. 2005) (noting distinction between federal and Texas approaches when federal procedure governed\nadmissibility of expert testimony but Texas state law governed substantive sufficiency of evidence review); see also, e.g., Friedrich v.\nFetterman & Assocs., P.A., 137 So. 3d 362, 366-67 (Fla. 2013) (reinstating trial court’s judgment in favor of defendant when plaintiff’s\nexpert testified that defendant would have discovered defect in chair in reasonable inspection, even though expert testified that reasonable\ninterval for inspection was every six months but failed to provide basis for concluding how long defect was present in chair such that\njury could have concluded that defect would have existed at time of reasonable inspection); Rosa v. Lawrence & Mem’l Hosp., 74 A.3d\n534, 554, 556-57 (Conn. App. Ct. 2013) (holding that expert testimony was legally sufficient to support jury’s finding that defendant’s\nnegligent provision of anesthesiological services caused plaintiff’s chronic foot pain when expert testified that he could not determine\nwhether plaintiff’s nerve damage resulted from medical care or from plaintiff’s unrelated diabetes). But see Stelwagon Mfg. Co. v.\nTarmac Roofing Sys., Inc., 63 F.3d 1267, 1274-76 (3d Cir. 1995) (rejecting challenge to admissibility of expert evidence of damages\nbut holding that expert testimony was not legally sufficient to support damages award because expert did not provide evidence that lost\nsales were caused by defendant’s price discrimination). When an expert does not opine directly on an issue, however, a party’s reliance\non the expert’s testimony does not insulate the issue from legal-sufficiency attacks. See Domingo ex rel. Domingo v. T.K., 289 F.3d 600,\n607-08 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that no evidence supported causation for plaintiff’s claim because ″bits and pieces″ of defense expert’s\ntestimony were not sufficient when they were ″stray comments″ taken out of context and experts did not testify to causation). The Eight\nCircuit has noted the legal insufficiency of speculative expert testimony when the testimony was improperly admitted. See, e.g., Concord\nBoat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1057 (2000).\nCourts outside of Texas have been more willing to hold that unreliable expert testimony is not legally sufficient to support a finding in\nthe context of reviewing administrative decisions. See City of Philadelphia v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd. (Kriebel), 29 A.3d 762, 770\n(Pa. 2011) (holding that expert testimony was legally insufficient to rebut statutory presumption that occupational disease was causally\nrelated to employment because it lacked an adequate factual foundation); Eastwood v. Dep’t of Labor & Indus., 219 P.3d 711, 714, 717\n(Wash. Ct. App. 2009) (holding that expert testimony was legally insufficient to support lower court’s finding of compensable\naggravation in review of workers’ compensation claim denial).\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 65 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *84\n\nproffering party can no longer respond to attacks with additional evidence to bolster perceived\nweaknesses in the expert’s analysis. 459 Because of this, Texas’s approach can permit disfavored\nlitigation practices such as ″laying behind the log,″ ″ambush″ techniques, and trial of cases on less than\n″the fullest knowledge of the facts and issues.″ 460 Third, as mentioned above, legal-sufficiency\nchallenges garner the less deferential de-novo standard of review rather than the abuse-of-discretion\nstandard applicable to admissibility decisions. 461\n\nPrecluding legal-sufficiency challenges based on reliability, on the other hand, insulates expert\nevidence from an evidentiary review to which some other types of evidence are subjected. Specifically,\ncourts in other jurisdictions presume that expert opinion evidence constitutes some evidence of the\nfacts as to which the expert opines - otherwise, the trial court should not have admitted the testimony\n- without looking below the surface of the opinion. Other types of evidence generally do not enjoy the\nsame presumption, even if admitted into evidence without objection. Nonexpert evidence may be\nlegally insufficient to support a jury finding when, for example, (1) it does not support the factual\nfinding under the circumstances of the case, even if it appears to support the finding on its face; 462\n(2) it is equally consistent with the absence of the fact it is offered to prove; 463 [*85] (3) it tends to\nprove the existence of damages in some amount but cannot support the amount of damages found; 464\n(4) it could create a question of fact if combined with other, additional evidence of the element for\nwhich it is offered, but it is not alone sufficient to create a question of fact; 465 or (5) the evidence is\nsubstantively defective. 466 There may be a well-founded justification for exempting expert evidence\nsuffering these same flaws from evidentiary review, but courts in other jurisdictions generally have not\narticulated justifications or otherwise specifically addressed the issue. Immunizing expert opinion\n459\n      See Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 409 (Tex. 1998) (″Without requiring a timely objection to the reliability of the\nscientific evidence, the offering party is not given an opportunity to cure any defect that may exist, and will be subject to trial and appeal\nby ambush.″).\n460\n      See City of San Antonio v.

L. Rev. 1, *85\n\ntestimony from legal-sufficiency reviews that arise out of challenges to the predicate underlying the\nopinion is problematic because the reliability of the expert’s predicate is the basis for admitting expert\nopinion testimony in the first place. 467 Lay opinion testimony, by contrast, is not admissible unless it\nsatisfies the requirements of Rule 701; lay witnesses can testify only as to the predicate for the\nwitness’s opinions and conclusions - i.e., the facts of which the witness has personal knowledge. 468\n\nProfessor Goode and his co-authors have criticized Havner and Coastal Transport as ″muddying the\ndistinction between admissibility and sufficiency.″ 469 They suggest that the Texas Supreme Court’s\ndistinction between the two types of challenges ″fails analytically, ignores the value of [the]\ntimely-objection rule, and is inconsistent with Rule 705.″ 470 More important, they argue, it ignores\ntwo benefits of the timely-objection rule: the rule deprives the trial and appellate courts of a fuller\nrecord that may be made in response to a trial objection and creates an [*86] unfairness. 471 According\nto Professor Goode and his co-authors, the proper approach on appeal when an expert opinion is\nunreliable but was not objected to in the trial court is not to reverse and render but to reverse and\nremand for a new trial. 472\n467\n      See, e.g., Fed.

Professor Goode and his co-authors do not explain why a belated objection is proper for faulty assumptions. See Burroughs\nWellcome Co. v. Crye, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499-500 (Tex. 1995) (holding expert’s testimony was no evidence when the ″assumed facts\nvaried materially from the actual, undisputed facts″). In private correspondence, Professor Goode has stated that he believes Crye is\ndistinguishable.\nThe expert there said that his opinion that the defendant’s spray caused the plaintiff’s frostbite was based on two assumptions and that\nhis opinion would be different if those assumptions were not true. The plaintiff then testified that those two assumptions were not true\n(and there was no evidence contravening the plaintiff’s testimony). In other words, on the face of the record, the expert’s testimony was\n″if X, the defendant’s spray caused the injury; if not X, the defendant’s spray did not cause the injury.″ Since the uncontroverted record\nwas that X did not exist, the expert’s testimony was actually that the defendant’s spray did not cause the injury. So it’s perfectly logical\nfor a reviewing court to say there’s no evidence that the spray caused the injury - even if there had not been an objection to the expert’s\ntestimony.\n\nLetter from Steven Goode, Professor, Univ. of Tex. Sch. of Law, to Harvey Brown, Justice, First Court of Appeals (May 28, 2014) (on\nfile with author).\nWhile the objection may not be obvious when the testimony is admitted (because the evidence has not been admitted yet disproving the\nassumption), certainly a motion to strike at trial is available if the reason for requiring a trial objection is so a party may respond to the\nobjection by presenting additional evidence.\n472\n       2 Goode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 702.1, at 19 (Supp. 2014) According to them, ″[a] more logical approach would\nhave been for the [Texas Supreme] Court [in Pollock] to have held the expert opinions inadmissible due to their unreliability. If\ninadmissible, they could not have been considered evidence of causation.″ Id. They suggest that the proper analysis is found in Moff v.\nState, where the Court of Criminal Appeals held that a trial court objection is not required to preserve appellate review of the sufficiency\nof the evidence. Id. at 8 n.24.05; Moff v. State, 131 S.W.3d 485, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). If the appellant successfully complains\nthat the trial court erred in admitting evidence, the error is reversible and requires a new trial. Moff, 131 S.W.3d at 489. The Moff Court\nexplained that, although ″a claim of trial court evidentiary error and a claim of insufficient evidence overlap,″ they require separate\nanalysis because ″an appellate court must consider all evidence actually admitted at trial in its sufficiency review and give it whatever\nweight and probative value it could rationally convey to a jury.″ Id. (footnote omitted). Thus, even if the evidence was improperly\nadmitted, the evidence still must be considered in a sufficiency challenge. Id. at 489-90; see also Powell v.

Moff, 131 S.W.3d at 490. Professors\nDix and Dawson explained:\nThis rule rests in large part upon what is perceived as the unfairness of barring further prosecution where the State has not had a fair\nopportunity to prove guilt. A trial judge’s commission of trial error may lull the State into a false sense of security that may cause it to\nlimit its presentation of evidence. Erroneous admission of hearsay evidence, for example, may cause the State to forego offering other\nevidence that would ultimately prove admissible.\nId. at 490 (quoting 43A George E. Dix & Robert O.

This Rule grants the proponent ″more flexibility in presenting such\ntestimony″ and allows ″the main point to be stated early.″ 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra note 187, § 7:23, at 909. Thus,\nRule 705 in effect puts the burden on the opponent. The wisdom of this approach rests on the notion that the price of requiring the\nfoundation to be laid first is simply too high, and obviously on the idea that the mechanism of cross is adequate to the task of exposing\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 68 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous.

It is implausible to suggest,\npost-Daubert, that parties will initially present less than their best expert evidence in the expectation\nof a second chance should their first try fail.″ 479\nCertainly Professor Goode and his co-authors are correct that Havner, Coastal Transport, Whirlpool,\nand Pollock have changed the landscape of error preservation for expert challenges. And certainly there\nare good arguments as to the wisdom of this shift.\n6. Potential Procedural Solutions. Unlike the rules governing the admissibility of expert evidence, the\nrules governing legal-sufficiency complaints were not designed for, and generally have not been\nspecifically tailored to, the complexities of modern expert evidence. Legal-sufficiency complaints can\nbe raised for the first time quite late in the trial proceedings - including after the judgment - and often\nare quite general. Thus, allowing no-evidence challenges to expert evidence can operate to deprive the\nproffering party of notice of the problem at a time when the proffering party might have been able to\nremedy it. When criticisms of expert evidence are raised and addressed in a Daubert hearing, for\nexample, the proffering party is put on notice of the complaint and has an opportunity to put additional\nsupport for an expert’s opinions into the record, to elicit supplemental explanation from a testifying\nexpert, or to demonstrate why the criticism is not well founded. When criticisms are raised for the first\ntime after the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, the proffering party has limited, if any, means of taking\nsuch corrective actions.\nAssuming Texas courts will continue to allow conclusory objections to be raised to expert testimony\nfor the first time postverdict, 480 one possible procedural solution to mitigate this [*89] rule’s potential\nharshness in civil cases 481 would be to permit trial courts to grant a new trial and courts of appeals\nto remand for a new trial, when a defendant 482 prevails on a legal-sufficiency challenge based on\ndefects in expert evidence not raised when, or before, the evidence was offered. This practice would\nbe consistent with the rules of civil and appellate procedure authorizing new trials, which authorize\ntrial courts to grant a new trial ″for good cause″ 483 and courts of appeals to remand for new trial when\n″the interest of justice″ requires it. 484\nWhile a legal-sufficiency challenge does not have to be raised before evidence is admitted at trial, it\ndoes have to be raised in the trial court in order to be preserved for appeal - through a motion for\nany flaws in the expert’s reasoning… . It is faith in the skill of trial counsel, the power of the cross, and the skepticism, common sense,\nand critical faculties of judges and juries, that underlie the conclusion that the exposure of weakness or fatal deficiencies in expert\ntestimony may be left to the calling party’s opponent.\n\nId. § 7:22, at 906-07. Nevertheless, this path is ″seldom taken.″ Id. § 7:23, at 910.\n479\n      Weisgram v. Marley Co., 528 U.S. 440, 455 (2000) (citations omitted).\n480\n      It is worth noting that this legal-sufficiency rule is not limited to expert testimony. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Justiss, 397\nS.W.3d 150, 156-57 (Tex. 2012) (observing that the Court held decades earlier that ″the naked and unsupported opinion or conclusion\nof a witness does not constitute evidence of probative force and will not support a jury finding even when admitted without objection″\n(quoting Dall.

In the latter instance, the\nplaintiff could be permitted to file a motion for new trial attaching new evidence tending to cure the\ndefect(s) in its expert evidence. Trial courts could be permitted to grant such motions if (1) the\nsuccessful no-evidence challenge was based on one or more deficiencies in the expert evidence that the\ndefendant had not raised when or before the [*90] evidence was offered; and (2) the plaintiff filed\nsupplemental evidence sufficient to cure the newly raised deficiencies in its expert evidence.\n\nGenerally, trial courts could decide such motions under the existing procedures for motions for new\ntrial, and courts of appeals could review trial courts’ decisions under the same abuse of discretion\nstandard generally applicable to motions for new trial, 487 except the ″newly discovered evidence″\nstandard would likely need to be more lenient. Currently, a party may seek a new trial on the basis of\nnewly discovered evidence if the party demonstrates that ″(1) the evidence has come to its knowledge\nsince the trial, (2) its failure to discover the evidence sooner was not due to lack of diligence, (3) the\nevidence is not cumulative, and (4) the evidence is so material it would probably produce a different\nresult if a new trial were granted.″ 488 A plaintiff could satisfy the third and fourth prongs by filing with\nthe motion new evidence that supplemented or buttressed the plaintiff’s expert evidence in a manner\nsufficient to convert it from ″no evidence″ to ″some evidence,″ assuming the defendant was not entitled\nto judgment on some other, independent basis. But under this approach, the first and second\nrequirements would need to be modified to permit the plaintiff to present evidence that was available\nto it at the time of trial but that was not necessary given the objections (or lack thereof) raised at that\ntime. The first prong could be modified to permit not only evidence that has come to the plaintiff’s\nknowledge since the trial, but also evidence responsive to objections to expert testimony that have\ncome to the plaintiff’s knowledge since the trial. The second prong could be satisfied not only by\nshowing that the plaintiff was diligent in discovering evidence but also by showing that the plaintiff\nwas diligent in responding to the defendant’s objections to the expert evidence raised before or at trial.\nThe motion for new trial in this context does more than give the trial court an opportunity to consider\nwhether the plaintiff’s supplemental evidence cures the deficiencies that render the expert evidence\nconclusory - it gives the plaintiff an opportunity to seek review of the trial court’s decision on appeal\nand to do so on the basis of a record that contains all of the evidence the plaintiff could have submitted\nto the trial court if the defendant’s complaints had been raised in a Daubert motion.\n485\n      Cecil v.

L. Rev. 1, *90\n\nThis approach addresses circumstances in which a trial court sustains a no-evidence attack, but not\ncircumstances in which a [*91] trial court denies a no-evidence challenge but the court of appeals\nsustains it. In that instance, we suggest that the rules of appellate procedure could be amended to\nauthorize a limited remand to the trial court when an appellate court holds, for the first time, that expert\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the judgment due to deficiencies in expert evidence that the\ndefendant did not raise until after the close of the plaintiff’s evidence. 489 The remand instructions to\nthe trial court could afford the plaintiff a limited opportunity to move for new trial on the basis of new\nevidence tending to cure the deficiencies in its expert evidence. The trial court could then grant or deny\nthe motion for new trial depending on whether the plaintiff had satisfied the four altered elements\ndiscussed above. If the trial court denied the motion for new trial, the trial court’s new judgment would\nbe appealable to the court of appeals, which would then review (under the abuse of discretion standard\ngenerally applicable to motions for new trial) only issues relating to the trial court’s decision(s) on\nremand, before the whole case could be brought before the Texas Supreme Court in a petition for\nreview. If the trial court granted the motion for new trial, such orders are now broadly subjected to\nmandamus review, 490 thus limiting the potential for a costly and time-consuming second trial when\nthe trial court incorrectly determines that the new evidence provides a legally sufficient foundation for\nthe expert’s opinion.\nOne shortcoming of the remand approach is that if the plaintiff is permitted to buttress the reliability\nof its expert testimony for the first time on remand, it is advantaged by the appellate court’s analysis\nof the issue - analysis the proffering party would not have in, say, a Daubert hearing. But the power\nto avoid providing that advantage to the proffering party rests in the hands of the opposing party, who\nmay simply raise his objections before or when the expert evidence is offered at trial.\nFinally, we note that Rule 703 permits an expert to rely on inadmissible facts or data in forming her\nopinion, as long as they are the kind of facts or data reasonably relied on by experts in the field, 491\nand Rule 104(a) permits trial courts to consider [*92] inadmissible evidence in ruling on expert\nchallenges. 492 In light of these rules and the justifications for them, we suggest that parties proffering\nexpert evidence should be permitted to put inadmissible evidence reasonably relied on by the expert\nbefore the court, even in the absence of an objection to admissibility. And courts should be permitted\nto consider inadmissible evidence reasonably relied on by experts when reviewing the legal sufficiency\nof expert evidence. Similarly, a party seeking a new trial under the standards discussed above should\nbe permitted to file inadmissible evidence in support of the motion. In short, the rules should permit\n489\n      Cf. Humble Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. Gomez, 146 S.W.3d 170, 195 (Tex. 2004) (″Because the parties have not focused on the issue\nwe think is crucial, we conclude that the interests of justice would be best served by a new trial.″); Boyles v.

When a party seeks relief from a court on the basis of such materials, the party\nshould, of course, retain the burden of drawing the court’s attention to the specific materials that\nsupport the relief requested.\n\nWe recognize that some Texas courts of appeals have indicated that inadmissible evidence generally\nmay not be considered in a legal-sufficiency review. 493 But the Texas Supreme Court has not expressly\nadopted this rule, and whatever the validity of the rule outside the context of expert evidence, it cannot\nbe strictly applied to legal-sufficiency challenges to the reliability of the basis for an expert’s opinion\n- Rule 703 expressly permits an opinion to be based on inadmissible evidence by the rules of evidence.\n494\n    The Texas [*93] Supreme Court’s legal-sufficiency reviews in expert-evidence cases seem to be\nin accord. The epidemiological and animal studies at issue in Havner, for example, would presumably\nhave been inadmissible hearsay if offered independently of expert testimony. 495 Thus, under our\nproposal, those studies could be considered in a legal-sufficiency review.\n\nDoubtless, these potential procedures add complications to the current procedure in civil cases,\nparticularly the advent of a limited remand to consider a new trial. But they are attempts to develop\na middle ground between the two extremes. There may be other, better, or equally workable solutions\nout there. We suggest only that a middle ground is worthy of consideration, in light of the unique nature\nof Texas’s legal-sufficiency review of expert evidence. In our view, courts should explore - including\nthrough amendments to the rules of procedure - a less harsh means of dealing with such no-evidence\nchallenges than automatically rendering judgment against a proffering party who was not put on notice\nof any issue by an objection and who perhaps could have, and would have, cured the objectionable\naspect of its expert evidence if given the opportunity. An automatic remand for new trial, on the other\nhand, would create an unnecessary waste of judicial resources when the conclusory or speculative\nnature of expert evidence could not be cured. A procedural practice that affords proponents of expert\ntestimony an opportunity to meet criticisms of the testimony after they are raised - including when the\ncriticism is couched as a ″no evidence″ complaint and raised for the first time postverdict - is the most\npractical compromise between the two.\n\n\n493\n      See supra note 472.\n494\n         Tex. R. Evid. 703. Havner makes clear that objected-to, inadmissible expert evidence cannot be considered in a legal-sufficiency\nreview. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711-12 (Tex. 1997) (″To accept the expert’s opinion as some evidence\n″simply because he used the magic words’ would effectively remove the jurisdiction of the appellate courts to determine the legal\nsufficiency of the evidence in any case requiring expert testimony… . It could be argued that looking beyond the testimony to determine\nthe reliability of scientific evidence is incompatible with our no evidence standard of review. If a reviewing court is to consider the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the argument runs, a court should not look beyond the expert’s testimony to determine\nif it is reliable. But such an argument is too simplistic. It reduces the no evidence standard of review to a meaningless exercise of looking\nto see only what words appear in the transcript of the testimony, not whether there is in fact some evidence.″).

The scientific approach invites consideration of all available\ninformation, including information that is incomplete, flawed, or of questionable reliability, with the\nscientist discerning what weight to afford each piece of information in light of any shortcomings. 497\nA jury, by contrast, [*94] may consider only the evidence admitted by the court - information that is\nnarrowly tailored to the issues in the case, having been filtered by a myriad of rules and procedures\ndesigned to eliminate anything that is irrelevant, misleading, unreliable, or excessively prejudicial. 498\nOne explanation for these inverse approaches can be found in the different roles of scientists and\njurors. In the context of her own work, the scientist acts as both judge and jury, deciding what\ninformation to consider, what purposes to consider it for, how much weight to give it, and the ultimate\nimport of all the information. This role reflects general perceptions of scientific research. The\nconsumer of information in this context is an expert in the field who is well suited to evaluate the\nrelative reliability and relevance of various pieces of information. The method of information\nprocessing used, the scientific method, is designed to neutralize passions and prejudices in the\nevaluation of information. And the peer-review process and the evolutionary nature of scientific\nresearch enable identification and correction of biases, design defects, or analytical flaws, on an\nongoing basis.\nIn the courtroom, the judge acts as arbiter of what facts and opinions are appropriate for juror\nconsumption, while jurors generally decide what weight to give the information and the ultimate\nimport of conflicting information. 499 The juror’s role reflects general perceptions of the courtroom.\nJurors generally are not experts in the law, nor in the field about which an expert witness testifies. The\nlaw does not presume jurors are well suited to decipher the legally relevant from the legally irrelevant\n500\n    or [*95] the scientifically reliable from the scientifically unreliable, 501 nor does it presume they\nare dispassionate in their evaluation of information. 502 The informational predicate for a judgment\ngenerally reflects a snapshot in time - the legal community is not afforded an opportunity to reassess\n496\n      The 1999 article identifies this gate as ″foundational reliability.″ See Brown, supra note 1, at 811-12. Because courts have come\nto use the term ″foundational″ to refer collectively to the type of reliability discussed here as well as ″methodological reliability″ and\n″connective reliability,″ we have renamed this gate ″predicative reliability″ for greater clarity.\n497\n      See infra Part III.B.1.b (discussing this ″weight of the evidence″ approach).\n498\n      See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 401-15 (relevance and prejudice); id. 601-15 (witness reliability); id. 701-06 (reliability of opinion\ntestimony); id. 801-07 (hearsay); id. 901-1008 (reliability of nontestimonial evidence).\nLegal scholars take different views as to the best unifying principle through which to view the rules of evidence. Some advocate a ″jury\ncontrol″ principle, viewing the rules of evidence as designed to prevent juries from affording undue weight to particular kinds of\nevidence; others, a ″best evidence″ principle, viewing the rules as designed to prefer use of the best evidence available, permitting use\nof lesser evidence when the best evidence is unavailable; and still others, a ″worst evidence″ principle, viewing the rules as designed\nto prevent, deter, and expose perjury by witnesses. Compare Edward J. Imwinkelried, The Worst Evidence Principle: The Best\nHypothesis as to the Logical Structure of Evidence Law, 46 U. Miami L. Rev. 1069, 1072 (1992) (advocating the ″worst evidence″\nprinciple and discussing the ″jury control″ principle), with Dale A. Nance, The Best Evidence Principle, 73 Iowa L. Rev. 227, 293 (1988)\n(advocating the ″best evidence″ principle). The courts’ construction and application of Rule 702 could likewise be viewed through these\nparadigms. Fear of perjury by paid experts, in particular, seems to be a motivating factor in judicial review of expert evidence, if typically\nan unspoken one.\n499\n      See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 103.\n500\n      Fed. R. Evid. 401-02 (admissibility of relevant evidence).\n\f                                                                                                                            Page 73 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous.

Rev. 1, *95\n\nand modify the facts on which a judgment was based when new developments come to light. 503 And\nexpert testimony in the courtroom is not subject to traditional peer review (although the predicative\nmaterials on which the expert relies may have been). The absence of these safeguards is exacerbated\nby the fact that experts providing scientific evidence in a courtroom are subject to greater bias\nprovocations, particularly ″adversarial bias,″ than scientists in the field. 504\n\nBecause of the differences in how evidence is used, a tension arises when an expert brings opinions\nbased on such evidence to the courtroom. Under the old Frye test, this tension was resolved in\ndeference to the judgment of the scientific community: an expert’s opinion was admissible if the theory\nunderlying the [*96] opinion had achieved ″general acceptance″ in the expert’s field. 505 The barrier\nto entry was high, 506 but trial judges did not review the factual assumptions, data collections, studies,\nand opinions on which testifying experts relied in reaching their conclusion to ensure certain standards\nof reliability were satisfied, as they would if the evidence were offered in a judicial proceeding. 507 The\nmodern evidentiary regime for expert testimony, ushered in by Daubert and its progeny, 508 shifted\nmuch of the ″gatekeeping″ responsibility from the scientific community at large to the trial judge. 509\n501\n      Fed. R. Evid. 702-03 (admissibility of expert witness testimony).\n502\n      See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 402 (requiring trial courts to filter out irrelevant evidence); id. 403 (requiring trial courts to filter out\nevidence that is relevant but more prejudicial than probative).\n503\n      The Supreme Court observed in Daubert:\n\nThere are important differences between the quest for truth in the courtroom and the quest for truth in the laboratory. Scientific\nconclusions are subject to perpetual revision. Law, on the other hand, must resolve disputes finally and quickly. The scientific project\nis advanced by broad and wide-ranging consideration of a multitude of hypotheses, for those that are incorrect will eventually be shown\nto be so, and that in itself is an advance. Conjectures that are probably wrong are of little use, however, in the project of reaching a quick,\nfinal, and binding legal judgment - often of great consequence - about a particular set of events in the past. We recognize that, in practice,\na gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how flexible, inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights\nand innovations. That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic\nunderstanding but for the particularized resolution of legal disputes.\n\nDaubert v.

In endeavoring to demonstrate that an expert’s opinions are\nsupported by a reliable predicate - i.e., ″an adequate foundation of relevant facts, data, or opinions,″\n528\n    - a proffering party must bear in mind a number of key considerations. First, the predicate must be\nadequate in two ways: it must be reliable in and of itself and it must actually support the opinions\nreached by the expert. 529 Second, in Texas courts, the adequacy of the predicate must be proved up\nin a manner that will withstand attack not only in a preadmission Daubert hearing but also in a\npostjudgment legal-sufficiency review. 530 Third, unlike the old Frye test, what is considered adequate\nsupport for an opinion in the scientific community may not be considered adequate support for an\nopinion in a courtroom. 531 We discuss each of these requirements below.\n\na. Components of Predicative Reliability. The predicative reliability requirement originates in the\nSupreme Court’s recognition in Daubert that expert opinions must rest ″on a reliable foundation.″ 532\nThe Court expanded on this requirement in Joiner, affirming the trial court’s decision to exclude expert\ntestimony because the animal and epidemiological studies on which the experts relied did not provide\nsufficient support for the experts’ conclusions that the plaintiff’s exposure to PCBs caused his cancer.\n533\n    Five months before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Joiner, the Texas Supreme Court\nconducted a similar review in Havner, when it concluded that the epidemiological and animal studies\non which the plaintiffs’ experts relied did not provide adequate support for their conclusion that\nBendectin caused the plaintiffs’ daughter’s birth [*100] defects. 534 Under Havner, ″if the foundational\ndata underlying opinion testimony are unreliable, an expert will not be permitted to base an opinion\non that data because any opinion drawn from that data is likewise unreliable.″ 535 The Havner Court\nalso instructed that the epidemiological studies on which the plaintiffs’ experts relied provided a\nreliable predicate for the experts’ opinions only if they were soundly designed and executed and\nactually supported the experts’ conclusions. 536\n\nThe predicative reliability gate thus has two principal components: (1) the predicate itself must be\nreliable (which we call ″predicative soundness″); and (2) the predicate must actually support the\nexpert’s opinion (which we call ″predicative probativeness″). 537 While the first prong relates to the\nquality of an expert’s predicate, the second prong relates to the probative value, if any, the predicate\naffords the expert’s opinion. The second prong is particularly important in Texas, where it is the basis\n527\n      Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997); see also Kumho Tire Co. v.

Predicative Soundness. When an expert bases his opinion on the scientific data, studies, or\nanalysis of others, the reliability of the underlying material is vital to the reliability of the expert’s\nconclusions - expert opinions predicated on untrustworthy information are themselves untrustworthy.\n″While an expert’s data need not be admissible, the data cannot be derived from a manifestly unreliable\nsource.″ 541 Essentially, when an expert’s analysis is based on the work of others, the underlying work\nis subject to the same tests for reliability as the expert’s own work and conclusions. 542 Analysis of the\nfirst component of predicative reliability, predicative soundness, thus may mirror the kind of analysis\nthat takes place at the methodological reliability and connective reliability gates except that, rather than\nexamining the methodology, accuracy, and reasoning of a testifying expert’s own analysis and\nopinions, the court must examine the methodology, accuracy, and reasoning employed by the experts\n\n538\n      As used by the Texas Supreme Court, the term ″basis″ generally includes all components of reliability: the predicate for an expert’s\nopinion, the methodology the expert uses, and the reasoning the expert employs to extract opinions from the results, if any extraction\nis necessary. See Elizondo v. Krist, 415 S.W.3d 259, 265 (Tex. 2013) (using the term ″basis″ largely to refer to the expert’s inadequate\nreasoning from predicate to conclusion); Burrow v.

Courts generally\nrequire more than an ″expert’s bald assurance of validity,″ seeking appropriate documentation and\nexplanation as well. 547 In In re Allied Chemical Corp., the Texas Supreme Court warned that ″an\nexpert’s assurance that a study establishes causation does not make it so. Claimants must have an\nexpert who can answer why a study is reliable.″ 548 Challenges to the soundness of an expert’s\npredicative data or studies generally must be raised before the expert’s opinions are admitted at trial,\nsuch as through a Daubert motion, or they are waived. 549\n\n [*103] ii. Predicative Probativeness. The second component of predicative reliability, predicative\nprobativeness, looks at whether an expert has identified a predicate for her opinion and if so, whether\nthe identified predicate is, in fact, favorably probative of the expert’s conclusions. An expert’s\npredicate not only must be ″sound science″ but also must actually support the expert’s conclusions.\nThus, even when the study, data collection, and analysis on which a testifying expert relies are well\ndesigned and properly executed, they generally will not provide a reliable predicate for the testifying\n\n543\n       See, e.g., Kilpatrick v. Breg, Inc., 613 F.3d 1329, 1337-38 (11th Cir. 2010). In Kilpatrick, the Eleventh Circuit upheld a district\ncourt’s ruling that an expert could not rely on an article in the American Journal of Sports Medicine to support his conclusion that pain\npumps that administered bupivacaine caused chondrolysis. Id. The article analyzed the medical records of 152 patients who had\nundergone arthroscopic shoulder surgeries, but only nineteen of the patients had pain pumps inserted, and of those nineteen, only ten\ndeveloped chondrolysis in twelve shoulders. Id. at 1337. Neither the article nor the expert relying on it was able to explain whether such\na small sample size could produce statistically meaningful results under the circumstances; neither the article nor the expert accounted\nfor other potential causes of chondrolysis; and neither the article nor the expert offered an explanation as to why the pain pumps caused\nchondrolysis in some patients but not others. Id. at 1337-38.\n\nThe Kilpatrick court also rejected the expert’s reliance on (1) a case study of two individuals who developed chondrolysis because there\nwas no analysis, only the reporting of the facts in the two cases; and (2) an editorial the expert co-authored in a scientific periodical\nbecause, as the expert recognized, it was ″general in nature and did not present any factual context that would allow the court to discern\nits relevance.″ Id. at 1339-40.\n544\n     See, e.g., Slaughter v.

The Kilpatrick court upheld the lower court’s ruling that\nthe claimants’ expert could not rely on an animal study involving rabbits when the study’s authors expressly declined to extrapolate the\nstudy’s findings to humans, noting the absence of data regarding ″the human equivalent dosing of … bupivacaine in a rabbit shoulder\nmodel.″ Id.

L. Rev. 1, *104\n\nThis component of predicative reliability can overlap other reliability gates - particularly, connective\nreliability. 557 For example, if an expert opines that substance X caused a plaintiff’s disease but relies\non a study that finds no association between substance X and the disease, the opinion lacks a basis and\nis conclusory; it fails at the predicative reliability gate. 558 But if the expert offers the same opinion\nand points to a study finding a strong association between substance X and the disease at dosages\ndouble the plaintiff’s dosage, connective reliability is implicated: the study may provide a reliable\npredicate if the expert can bridge the ″analytical gap″ by demonstrating that the difference in dosage\nlevels is not important to the causal connection. 559 If the expert fails to bridge the gap, the opinion\nlacks connective (and predicative) reliability. When predicative materials directly support an expert’s\nopinions based on them, there is no gap and connective reliability does not come into play. Similarly,\nwhen the predicative materials do not provide any support for the expert’s opinion, the two cannot be\nbridged together at all. But predicative materials may provide indirect [*105] support for the expert’s\nopinion that the expert can rely upon if she can demonstrate a sound link between the two. This is just\none of many instances of interlocking between the reliability gates.\nb. Granulation v. Weight-of-the-Evidence. One dichotomy that has arisen in reviewing the reliability\nof an expert opinion is between the ″weight of the evidence″ approach, in which a court considers all\nof the expert’s predicative materials collectively to determine whether they provide a reliable basis for\nthe expert’s conclusion, and a more ″granular″ or ″atomized″ approach, in which a court considers each\nof the predicative materials on which the expert relies individually to determine whether it provides\nreliable support for the expert’s conclusions.\nThe Supreme Court’s connective reliability review in Joiner has been described as ″strikingly\natomized.″ 560 The Court reviewed the reliability of each of the experts’ underlying materials on an\nindividual basis. First, the Court rejected the experts’ reliance on animal studies performed on infant\nmice injected with massive doses of PCBs as too ″far-removed″ from the plaintiff’s environmental\nexposure to significantly smaller doses as an adult human. 561 Then the Court reviewed and rejected,\none-by-one, the experts’ reliance on four epidemiological studies. 562 The Court’s ultimate conclusion\n- that the studies ″were not sufficient, whether individually or in combination, to support [the experts’]\nconclusions″ 563 - leaves room for a more holistic approach, but rightly or wrongly, the Joiner opinion\nlargely has been construed as endorsing a granulated review of predicative expert materials. 564\n\n557\n      See infra Part III.D.\n558\n      See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 818.\n559\n      See infra Part III.D.\n560\n      Jennifer L.

Although Joiner had argued that the supporting evidence was sufficient under a ″weight of the evidence″ approach,\nthe Joiner majority did not expressly approve or reject that approach.\n564\n      Unlike the majority, Justice Stevens directly addressed the ″weight of the evidence″ approach advocated by Joiner’s experts:\nJoiner’s experts used a ″weight of the evidence″ methodology to assess whether Joiner’s exposure to transformer fluids promoted his\nlung cancer. They did not suggest that any one study provided adequate support for their conclusions, but instead relied on all the studies\ntaken together (along with their interviews of Joiner and their review of his medical records)… .\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 81 of 230\n                                                       52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *106\n\n [*106]     The Texas Supreme Court’s approach in Havner was similarly granular. 565 The Court\nexamined each of the epidemiological studies relied on by the plaintiffs’ experts to determine whether\nit offered reliable support for the experts’ causation opinions. 566 The Court then did the same for each\nof the animal studies relied on. 567 The Court conducted a similar study-by-study review to determine\nwhether there was a reliable basis for expert opinions on causation in Pollock 568 and Merck. 569\nAdditionally, by adopting a bright-line test for epidemiological evidence (doubling of the risk and a\nstatistically significant confidence level), the Havner court precluded the possibility that epidemiological\nevidence below that line - i.e., evidence that does not, alone, support causation - might nevertheless\nprovide sufficient support for an expert opinion on causation if combined with enough other, similar\nevidence to reach a critical mass. 570 In Merck, the plaintiffs argued that ″the totality of the evidence″\n [*107] supported their expert’s causation opinion. 571 The Court stated, ″The totality of the evidence\ncannot prove general causation if it does not meet the standards for scientific reliability established by\nHavner. A plaintiff cannot prove causation by presenting different types of unreliable evidence.″ 572\nThe authors of the relevant chapter of the Federal Judicial Center’s (FJC) Reference Manual on\nScientific Evidence, on the other hand, favor a more holistic approach. They observe that ″many of the\nmost well-respected and prestigious scientific bodies … consider all the relevant available scientific\n\nIt is not intrinsically ″unscientific″ for experienced professionals to arrive at a conclusion by weighing all available scientific evidence\n- this is not the sort of ″junk science″ with which Daubert was concerned… . And using this methodology, it would seem that an expert\ncould reasonably have concluded that the study of workers at an Italian capacitor plant, coupled with data from Monsanto’s study and\nother studies, raises an inference that PCB’s promote lung cancer.\n\nId. at 152-54 (Stephens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (footnote omitted).\n565\n      Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v.

The comment to the Restatement states:\nSome courts [have] tried to develop bright-line rules based on science for adequate proof of factual causation. The high-water mark for\nthis overreliance on scientific thresholds occurred in the Bendectin litigation when one court announced a blanket rule that a plaintiff\ncould not make out a sufficient case without statistically significant epidemiologic evidence.\nThese courts may be relying on a view that ″science″ presents an ″objective″ method of establishing that, in all cases, reasonable minds\ncannot differ on the issue of factual causation. Such a view is incorrect. First, scientific standards for the sufficiency of evidence to\nestablish a proposition may be inappropriate for the law, which itself must decide the minimum amount of evidence permitting a\nreasonable (and, therefore, permissible) inference, as opposed to speculation that is not permitted. Second, scientists report that an\nevaluation of data and scientific evidence to determine whether an inference of causation is appropriate requires judgment and\ninterpretation. Scientists are subject to their own value judgments and preexisting biases that may affect their view of a body of evidence.\nThere are instances in which although one scientist or group of scientists comes to one conclusion about factual causation, they recognize\nthat another group that comes to a contrary conclusion might still be ″reasonable.″\nId. (citation omitted). The comment concludes that courts ″should be cautious about adopting specific ″scientific’ principles, taken out\nof context, to formulate bright-line legal rules or conclude that reasonable minds cannot differ about factual causation.″ Id.\n571\n      Merck, 347 S.W.3d at 267.\n572\n      Id. at 268.\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 82 of 230\n                                                       52 Hous.

And this is consistent\nwith one goal of expert evidentiary standards: to ensure that expert evidence offered in court is of the\nsame caliber as that employed by experts outside the courtroom. 581 On the other hand, as discussed\nabove, expert opinions in the courtroom are subject to limitations and biases that do not threaten the\n573\n      Margaret A.

Proof of risk and proof of causation entail somewhat different questions because risk assessment frequently\ncalls for a cost-benefit analysis… .

Therefore, only the plaintiff’s expert evidence on general causation (i.e., whether benzene was\ncapable of causing APL) was at issue; specific causation (i.e., whether benzene caused the plaintiff’s\nAPL) was not at issue. 586 The plaintiff’s expert had applied a ″weight of the evidence″ methodology\nto conclude that benzene was capable of causing APL. 587 The Milward court described the ″weight\nof the evidence″ approach as ″a mode of logical reasoning often described as ″inference to the best\nexplanation,’ in which the conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises.″ 588 ″In this mode of\nreasoning,″ the court acknowledged, ″the use of scientific judgment is necessary″; there is ″no\nalgorithm″ for determining ″whether an association truly reflects a causal relationship or is spurious″;\nand ″scientists may come to different judgments about whether such an inference is appropriate.″ 589\nThe court concluded that ″the fact that the role of judgment in the weight of the evidence approach is\nmore readily apparent than it is in other methodologies does not mean that the approach is any less\nscientific.″ 590\nOf course, the dispute among legal practitioners and commentators is not over whether experts should\napply a ″weight of the evidence″ approach to their scientific analysis outside the courtroom - it is a\ncommon and widely accepted scientific practice. 591 The dispute is over whether courts should admit\nan expert opinion based on the cumulative weight of the evidence when none of the individual pieces\nof evidence provides legally probative support for the expert’s opinion. The Milward court did more\nthan just hold that testifying experts can rely on a ″weight of the evidence″ methodology in their\nanalysis; it held that the district court erred by\ntreating the separate evidentiary components of [the expert’s] analysis atomistically, as though his\nultimate opinion was independently supported by each… .

Lipton, Tips from the Daubert Playbook, Part 1: Prepare to Get Your\nEpidemiologist’s Testimony Admitted, Trial, Mar. 2012, at 34, 36-38. Bernstein stated that Milward ″ignored Rule 702, disregarded the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Joiner, relied on obsolete precedents, misunderstood the underlying rationale for exclusionary rules for\nexpert testimony, misapplied basic scientific concepts, and credulously endorsed ″weight of the evidence’ as a valid scientific\nmethodology.″ Bernstein, supra note 246, at 29.\n594\n       Compare Bernstein, supra note 246, at 53 (describing Milward as ″the most notorious opinion rebelling against the post-Daubert\nadmissibility rules for expert testimony″), with Lipton, supra note 593, at 35 (describing the Milward court as ″recognizing Rule 702’s\nliberal intent″).\nTo date, only one state court has relied on Milward. See Harris v. CSX Transp., Inc., 753 S.E.2d 275, 289 (W. Va. 2013). The Supreme\nCourt of Appeals of West Virginia cited Milward extensively in holding that a trial court overstepped its gatekeeper function in excluding\nall of the plaintiff’s causation experts. See id. at 289, 301-02, 306. But while the court sanctioned the experts’ reliance on a ″weight of\nthe evidence″ approach in reaching his conclusion, the court did not expressly apply a ″weight of the evidence″ approach (or any\napproach) to review the studies and data on which the expert relied in reaching his conclusion. See id. at 296-97. The Eighth Circuit has\ncited to Milward, but not to the part of the opinion that endorses a ″weight of the evidence″ review. See Kuhn v. Wyeth, Inc., 686 F.3d\n618, 625 (8th Cir. 2012).\n595\n       Milward, 639 F.3d at 19 (quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999)). Applying this test, the court\ndetermined that the following five categories of evidence relied on by the plaintiff’s expert provided a ″scientifically sound and\nmethodologically reliable foundation.″ Id. at 20. The five categories of predicative evidence included: (1) ″the near-consensus among\ngovernmental agencies, experts, and active researchers in the field that benzene can cause [Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)],″ the\nclassification of leukemia that includes APL; (2) evidence that all types of AML derive from the same origin - genetically damaged\npluripotent stem cells - from which the expert concluded that all AMLs, including APL, have a common etiology; (3) ″toxicology studies\nestablishing that metabolites of benzene cause significant chromosomal damage at the stem cell level in the bone marrow - the type of\ndamage that is known to cause APL and other types of AML″; (4) two sets of studies indicating that benzene metabolites act as catalytic\ninhibitors of a cellular enzyme, ″topo II,″ that ″is essential for the maintenance of proper chromosome structure and segregation,″ which\nthe expert relied on as evidencing ″a known biological mechanism by which exposure to benzene could cause APL″; and (5) a small set\nof epidemiological studies showing ″an increased risk factor for APL, which although not statistically significant was consistent with\ncausality, and provided no grounds for concluding otherwise.″ Id. at 18-20. As these categories of evidence demonstrate, much of the\nanalysis of the reliability of the expert’s conclusion depended not on predicative reliability but on connective reliability - i.e., whether\nthe expert had demonstrated a reliable basis for extrapolating from evidence relating to causation of AMLs generally to reach a\nconclusion on causation of APL specifically and whether the expert had demonstrated a reliable basis for extrapolating from evidence\nrelating to inhibition of topo II and the chromosomal translocation seen in APL. See infra Part III.D., for a thorough discussion of\nconnective reliability. A principal difference between the district court’s analysis (which led to exclusion of the expert testimony) and\nthe circuit court’s analysis (which led to admission of the testimony) was that the circuit court determined that the expert adequately\nbridged these gaps and the district court reached the opposite conclusion. Milward, 639 F.3d at 20-23. If the circuit court had agreed with\nthe district court that the expert could not reliably extrapolate from evidence relating to AMLs generally and topo II inhibition, it is not\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 85 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *111\n\n [*111]\n2. Developments in Specific Categories of Predicates. As with the other reliability gates, the analysis\nof whether an expert’s opinion is founded on an adequate predicate necessarily differs from one\ncontext to the next. 596 Rule 702 lists three broad categories of expert testimony: scientific knowledge,\ntechnical knowledge, or other specialized knowledge. 597 The inquiry into whether an expert has\nprovided an adequate predicate for her opinion is determined on a case-by-case basis. 598 But within\nRule 702’s three categories of ″knowledge,″ certain types of predicates appear over and over in recent\ncase law. As a result, certain recurring themes and baselines have developed in the jurisprudence for\nassessing specific types of expert predicates within these categories of expertise. It is important to note\nthat while some predicative data, studies, facts, or assumptions may be inherently unreliable because\nthey are inherently unsound or lacking in quality, much predicative material is reliable for some\npurposes but not others. 599\n\n [*112]\n\na. Scientific Predicates. Expert evidence based on ″scientific″ knowledge 600 is perhaps the\nquintessential expert evidence. It is perhaps most often used to establish the element of causation in\ntort cases, particularly in toxic tort cases. 601 The trilogy of U.S. Supreme Court cases that form the\nbasis for judicial screening of expert testimony - Daubert, Joiner, and Kumho - all address expert\nopinions on causation in tort cases. 602 Daubert and Joiner were both toxic tort cases. 603 As the body\nof case law in this area has developed, so has the science. Courts are increasingly sophisticated in their\nanalysis of scientific evidence, particularly in the area of toxic torts, where specific causation issues\nrecur in multiple cases across multiple jurisdictions. In this section, we examine certain types of\npredicative material that experts commonly rely on in litigation involving scientific expert evidence.\nclear whether the circuit court would have admitted expert testimony supported only by that evidence and epidemiological evidence that\n″concededly lacked statistical significance.″ Id. at 25.\n596\n      See, e.g., Daniel J. Capra, The Daubert Puzzle, 32 Ga. L. Rev. 699, 781 (1998) (arguing that ″a flexible, expertise-dependent\nanalysis of reliability″ should be utilized).\n597\n      Fed. R. Evid. 702; Tex. R. Evid. 702; see also Kumho, 526 U.S. at 141 (explaining that the gatekeeping obligation, established\nin Daubert and imposed on trial judges, of ensuring that scientific testimony is reliable applies equally to scientific, technical, and other\nspecialized knowledge without any relevant distinction). The Kumho Court went on to say that Daubert only mentioned scientific\nknowledge because that was the specific category of knowledge at issue. See id.\n598\n      See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 552 U.S. 136, 143-47 (1997).\n599\n        See, e.g., Robert M. Lloyd, Proving Lost Profits After Daubert: Five Questions Every Court Should Ask Before Admitting Expert\nTestimony, 41 U. Rich. L. Rev. 379, 392 (2007) (″Outside of litigation, experts often use data of questionable reliability for one purpose\nwhen they would not think of using it for another.″). An example Lloyd provides is ″that when CPAs attach their names to financial\nstatements, they give one of three distinct levels of assurance that the statements are accurate.″ Id. at 392-93. Thus, in reviewing the\nreliability of lost profit calculations, courts should consider the particular type of financial statement utilized by the expert and other\ncircumstances relevant to the statement. Id. at 394. ″If the financial statements were prepared for tax purposes,″ for example, ″there was\nprobably an incentive to understate profits.″ Id. ″If they were prepared to persuade investors to invest in the enterprise or lenders to lend\nto it, there may have been the opposite incentive.″ Id.\n600\n      Fed.

L. Rev. 1, *112\n\ni. Specific v. General Causation. Before delving into this area of law, it is important to distinguish\nbetween two types of causation evidence in toxic tort cases. In these cases, courts generally require a\nclaimant to prove through scientific expert evidence that the toxic substance at issue is capable of\ncausing the type of injury suffered by the claimant (general causation) and that the toxic substance at\nissue actually caused the claimant’s injury (specific causation). 604 Courts generally examine whether\na toxic tort claimant has provided adequate evidence of general causation before reaching the issue of\nspecific causation. 605 When science has not yet developed direct evidence [*113] that a particular\nsubstance causes a particular injury, experts in toxic tort cases often rely on epidemiological studies\nand animal studies as indirect evidence of general causation. 606 Evidence of specific causation in a\ntoxic tort case is typically more direct. Once general causation is established, a claimant’s treating\nphysician, or another physician who has reviewed the claimant’s medical records, often will opine that\nthe claimant’s injury was caused by his exposure to the toxic chemical based on a ″differential\ndiagnosis″ technique. 607\n\nii. Epidemiological Studies. Epidemiology is the ″basic science of disease prevention.″ 608 Epidemiology\nendeavors to identify environmental (and, more recently, genetic) risk factors for disease and to offer\ninsights into the mechanisms involved in the origin of different diseases, as a first step in developing\napproaches to prevention. 609 Epidemiological investigation of disease pathogenesis (the mechanism\nthat causes a disease) can be divided into two steps: first, a statistical analysis of collected data to\ndetermine if a scientifically valid association exists between an agent and a disease; second, if a valid\nassociation exists, a determination of what conclusions (including conclusions about causation) can be\nderived from the data. 610 In the first step, associations are assessed in terms of several important\nconsiderations including: the relative risk, the confidence interval, and the quality of information. 611\nRelative risk measures how much more likely a person exposed to a particular substance is to contract\na particular disease than is an unexposed person. 612 ″A confidence interval provides both the relative\nrisk (or other risk measure) found in the study and a range (interval) within which the risk likely would\n\n\n604\n       See, e.g., Pluck v.

Frequently,\nindividual epidemiological studies find an association in the first step of the process but are not able\nto make determinations of causation based on that association alone. 623 Courts are careful to observe\nthat, although evidence of association can tend to show causation, association and causation are not\nlegally equivalent. 624 Courts have been particularly critical of epidemiological studies when there are\nother plausible causes that are not discounted and the connection between exposure and the disease is\nmerely temporal. 625 With respect to the latter, courts have invoked the logical fallacy of post hoc ergo\npropter hoc, observing that causation cannot be presumed merely because the disease or its symptoms\nfollow the exposure. 626\n\n [*116] The issue in Daubert was the admissibility of the expert opinion testimony that the drug\nBendectin caused certain birth defects. 627 After rejecting Frye’s ″general acceptance″ test in favor of\nRule 702’s relevancy and reliability requirements, 628 the Daubert Court remanded the case for\napplication of the new framework for determining the admissibility of expert evidence. 629 On remand,\nthe Daubert II court excluded opinion testimony that Bendectin caused the birth defects from experts\nrelying on three categories of predicates: epidemiological studies, animal studies, and the chemical\nstructure of Bendectin, as compared to that of other drugs suspected of causing birth defects. 630 With\nregard to the epidemiological studies, the Daubert II court held that, for an epidemiological study to\nshow causation under a preponderance of the evidence standard, it would have to demonstrate a\nrelative risk of at least 2.0 - i.e., that birth defects were twice as likely among mothers who took\n\n622\n       See Norris v.

First, the\nstudies themselves must have been conducted using ″sound methodology.″ 635 The Havner Court\ninstructed Texas courts to examine the design and execution of [*117] the epidemiological studies,\nespecially for bias. 636 Second, the Court held that the studies must demonstrate relative risk of more\nthan 2.0 - i.e., more than a ″doubling of the risk″ - which the Court linked to the ″more likely than not″\nstandard of proof applicable to causation. 637 The Court cautioned that a relative risk of more than 2.0\nwas not ″a litmus test,″ and that even a high relative risk does not necessarily prove a causal\nrelationship. 638 The Court expressly declined to decide ″whether epidemiological evidence with a\nrelative risk of less than 2.0, coupled with other credible and reliable evidence, may be legally\nsufficient to support causation.″ 639 Finally, the Court noted the particular importance of replication in\nepidemiology, 640 and stated that ″an isolated study finding statistically significant association between\nBendectin and [the birth] defects would not be legally sufficient evidence of causation.″ 641\nHavner’s conclusion must be considered in context.

In terms of statistical proof, this means that plaintiffs must establish not just that their mothers’ ingestion of\nBendectin increased somewhat the likelihood of birth defects, but that it more than doubled it - only then can it be said that Bendectin\nis more likely than not the source of their injury.\n\nId. at 1320 (citation omitted).\n632\n      Id. at 1321.\n633\n      Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v.

Garza, the plaintiffs argued that Havner’s requirement of at least two\nepidemiological studies demonstrating at least a ″doubling of the risk″ did not apply to clinical trials\nor, if the requirement did apply to clinical trials, it was not a bright-line rule. 646 The Texas Supreme\nCourt rejected these arguments and ″reiterated that when parties attempt to prove general causation\nusing epidemiological evidence, a threshold requirement of reliability is that the evidence demonstrate\na statistically significant doubling of the risk.″ 647 With respect to the difference between observational\nand experimental epidemiological studies, the Court stated:\n\nWhile the controlled, experimental, and prospective nature of clinical trials undoubtedly makes them\nmore reliable than retroactive, observational studies, both must show a statistically significant doubling\nof the risk in order to be some evidence that a drug more likely than not caused a particular injury. The\nsuperior way in which a study is conducted does not justify taking its conclusion to be anything other\nthan what it is. 648\n\nOn this basis, the Court concluded that the requirements identified in Havner ″necessarily apply to all\nepidemiological evidence.″ 649\n\nAlthough the Merck Court decided the case on the basis of general causation without reaching the\nplaintiffs’ specific causation evidence, the plaintiffs in that case presented separate evidence of specific\ncausation. 650 The Court could have distinguished Havner on this basis, because the plaintiffs in\nHavner relied exclusively on epidemiological evidence and animal [*119] studies to establish both\n642\n    As noted above, because they are controlled and prospective, randomized clinical trials are more reliable than observational studies.\nMerck & Co. v.

In In re Bextra and Celebrex Marketing\nSales Practices and Product Liability Litigation, the district court for the Northern District of California\ndistinguished Daubert II (on which the Havner Court relied in adopting the ″doubling of the risk″\nstandard 652) on this basis, stating that a relative risk of greater than 2.0 is necessary for\nepidemiological studies to be probative of specific causation but the same analysis does not apply\nwhen epidemiological evidence is relied on only to show general causation. 653 The district court for\nthe Central District of California reached the same conclusion in In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants\nProducts Liability Litigation, 654 as have several other federal district courts. 655 The Superior Court\nof Delaware likewise distinguished between general and specific causation, indicating that requiring\na relative risk of 2.0 ″makes sense″ in the context of specific causation, in which the plaintiff must\nshow that the substance in question ″more likely than not″ caused the injury in question. 656 But when\nepidemiological evidence ″is offered to support general causation, whether the exposure could cause\nharm at all, a less stringent standard is, by definition, weaker but potentially probative.″ 657\n\nBut in Merck, the Texas Supreme Court applied the ″doubling of the risk″ requirement for\nepidemiological evidence without regard to whether there was separate, reliable evidence [*120] of\nspecific causation. 658 And since Merck, the Court has continued to state the Havner requirements as\nabsolutes for epidemiological evidence. 659 Even under Borg-Warner Corp. v. Flores and Bostic v.\nGeorgia-Pacific Corp., in which the Court lightened, to some degree, the burden of proving causation\nin multi-defendant asbestos-related suits, the Texas Supreme Court strictly adhered to the Havner\nstandards for epidemiological evidence. 660 In light of the Texas Supreme Court’s unequivocal\nstatements in Merck, epidemiological evidence demonstrating a relative risk of less than 2.0 is\nprobably not admissible to show either specific or general causation in Texas courts. 661\n651\n       See Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v.

In In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litigation, the Ninth Circuit rejected\nan argument that, under Daubert II, parties claiming that exposure to radiation had caused their\nillnesses had to ″demonstrate that they had been exposed to a specific dose of radiation that statistically\n″doubled their risk’ of harm″ to establish general causation. 669 The court observed that this argument\nblurred the lines between general and specific causation, 670 noting: ″It is critical to stress that the\nplaintiffs in Daubert II had no scientific evidence that Bendectin was capable of causing birth defects\n(generic causation), and therefore were [*122] required to produce epidemiological studies to prove\nthat Bendectin more likely than not caused their own particularized injuries (individual causation).″ 671\nIn Hanford Nuclear, by contrast, general causation was not truly questioned, and the issue was one of\nspecific causation. 672 The court concluded that in that context it was error for the district court to\nrequire evidence that the claimants were exposed to a ″doubling dose″ of radiation without regard to\nindividual risk factors such as heredity. 673\n\nIt is not clear whether the Ninth Circuit’s distinction between ″doubling of the risk″ and ″doubling\ndose″ is viable under Texas law. 674 It is equally true in Texas that evidence of specific causation must\naccount for the relevant characteristics of the claimant in the case, such as medical history and genetic\ndisposition. 675 This would mean that once a claimant proffers reliable evidence of general causation,\nhe must demonstrate that the substance at issue more likely than not caused his injury in light of actual\ncircumstances, not that he was exposed to the dosage necessary to double the risk of injury under some\ngeneric set of circumstances. 676 And Havner reached largely the same result as Daubert II, under\nlargely the same circumstances - the experts relied on the disputed epidemiological evidence to support\nconclusions on both general and specific causation. 677 Thus, the Texas Supreme Court could\ndistinguish Havner in the same way that the Ninth Circuit distinguished Daubert II. But, as noted\nabove, the Texas Supreme Court applied the Havner standard in Merck without distinction, even\nthough the plaintiffs in Merck presented separate evidence of specific causation. 678\n\nIn a 2011 workplace radiation case, the Fifth Circuit relied on the standards for expert causation\nevidence articulated in Havner, concluding that the plaintiffs’ evidence failed as a matter of law\n669\n      In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litig., 292 F.3d 1124, 1130 (9th Cir. 2002).\n670\n      Id. at 1134-35.\n671\n      Id. at 1136-37.\n672\n       Claimants in the case alleged that their illness was caused by radiation emitted by a local nuclear power plant.

The\nprincipal issue in Bostic 683 was whether and how the Court’s 2007 decision in Flores, 684 a\nmulti-defendant asbestosis case, applied in a multi-defendant mesothelioma case. In Flores, the\nplaintiff alleged that he had suffered from asbestosis caused by exposure to various defendants’\nasbestos-containing products, including Borg-Warner’s. 685 In the Texas Supreme Court, Borg-Warner\nargued that, with respect to its products, the plaintiff had not offered evidence of proximate causation,\n686\n    which requires evidence of cause-in-fact - i.e., that the defendant’s act or omission be a substantial\nfactor in bringing about the plaintiff’s injury (substantial factor causation), without which the injury\nwould not have occurred (but-for causation). 687 Without using the phrase ″but-for causation,″ 688 the\nCourt held that a plaintiff in an [*124] asbestos action must submit evidence that a defendant’s product\n(and not merely any asbestos-containing product) was a substantial factor in bringing about the\nplaintiff’s injury.

In comment a, the Restatement states,\n\nThe word ″substantial″ is used to denote the fact that the defendant’s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead\nreasonable men to regard it as a cause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility, rather\nthan in the so-called ″philosophic sense,″ which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would\nnot have occurred.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 431 cmt. a (1965). The Flores Court parroted this statement, quoting a 1991 Texas Supreme Court\nopinion that, in turn, quoted this language from the Restatement. Flores, 232 S.W.3d at 770 (quoting Lear Siegler, Inc. v. Perez, 819\nS.W.2d 470, 472 (Tex. 1991)). The ″without which any happening would not have occurred″ language incorporates the idea of but-for\ncausation. Flores thus might have been read as preserving the but-for causation requirement.\n\f                                                                                                                            Page 95 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous.

(describing Flores). The Court in Flores also noted that ″while some respirable fibers may be released upon grinding some brake\npads, the sparse record here contains no evidence of the approximate quantum of Borg-Warner fibers to which Flores was exposed, and\nwhether this sufficiently contributed to the aggregate dose of asbestos Flores inhaled, such that it could be considered a substantial factor\nin causing his asbestosis.″ Flores, 232 S.W.3d at 772.\n691\n      Id. at 773.\n692\n     Bostic, 2014 WL 3797159, at 5. The Court had a six-member majority on this holding, including the five justices who joined the\nmajority opinion in its entirety and the one concurring justice.\n693\n       Id. at 6 (″We follow Flores and conclude that in products liability cases where the plaintiff was exposed to multiple sources of\nasbestos, substantial factor causation is the appropriate basic standard of causation without including as a separate requirement that the\nplaintiff meet a strict but for causation test.″). The Court had the same six-member majority on this holding. In support of this holding,\nthe Court observed,\n\nDue to the nature of the disease process, which can occur over decades and involve multiple sources of exposure, establishing which\nfibers from which defendant actually caused the disease is not always humanly possible. Even if the exposure from a particular defendant\nwas by itself sufficient to cause the disease, in multiple-exposure cases the plaintiff may find it impossible to show that he would not\nhave become ill but for the exposure from that defendant.\n\nId.\n\nThe Bostic Court indicated that this outcome was dictated by Flores, stating that ″the absence of but for language in Flores was not\ninadvertent.″ Id. at 7. But as noted above, Flores did quote the ″without which″ language from the Restatement, supra note 688, and in\nfact, the Bostic Court quoted this language from Flores at the outset of the opinion. Id. at 1. Regardless, the Bostic Court rejected any\nbut-for requirement in multi-exposure, asbestos-related toxic tort actions, and surmised that the Restatement’s authors would agree: ″We\ndo not think the Restatements, in their attempts to synthesize many decades of tort law, would require the plaintiffs to meet a strict but\nfor causation test in a case like today’s case.″ Id. at 8.\nThe Restatement (Third) of Torts: Physical & Emotional Harm reformulates the causation standard. As noted above, the Restatement\n(Second) of Torts requires ″legal cause,″ which it defines to include both the substantial factor and but-for causation elements.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 431(a), (b), cmt. a. The Restatement (Third) separates these two causal elements into ″factual cause,″\nwhich is but-for causation, see Restatement (Third) of Torts: Physical & Emotional Harm § 26 (2005) (″Conduct is the factual cause of\nharm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct.″), and the ″scope of liability (proximate cause),″ which is somewhat\nsimilar to Texas’s foreseeability element of causation, see id. § 29 (″An actor’s liability is limited to harms that result from the risks that\nmade the actor’s conduct tortious.″). Unlike its predecessor, the Restatement (Third) includes two sections that expressly address the\napplication of the but-for causation requirement in the context of harms caused by multiple actors. First, under section 27, when multiple\nacts occur, each of which would have been a but-for cause of the harm individually, each act is considered a factual cause. Id. § 27\n(″multiple sufficient causes″). A common example of this scenario is when two defendants fatally shot the plaintiff at the same time. Each\ndefendant could argue that his own shot was not a but-for cause of the plaintiff’s death because the other shot would have killed the\nplaintiff. Section 27 treats both defendants as the but-for cause of the plaintiff’s death. Second, under section 28(b), when a plaintiff\nproves that multiple actors engaged in tortious conduct, one or more of which caused the plaintiff’s injury, if the plaintiff cannot\nreasonably be expected to prove which actor or actors caused the harm, the burden of proof shifts to the defendants.

The Bostics’ specific causation expert ″made no attempt to measure Bostic’s actual aggregate\ndose assignable to Georgia-Pacific or any other source.″ 701 The Court held that ″proof of substantial\nfactor causation requires some quantification of the dose resulting from Bostic’s exposure to\n\n\n\n\ncomments indicate that section 28(b) was drafted with toxic tort cases in mind.

The Court offered this example:\nSuppose a plaintiff shows that his exposure to a defendant’s product more than doubled his chances of contracting a disease, but the\nevidence at trial also established that another source of the toxin increased the chances by a factor of 10,000.

The dissent argued that causation in a multi-defendant toxic tort\ncase involved three inquiries - general causation, specific causation, and substantial factor causation -\nand that the majority ″improperly applied Havner to answer all three questions.″ 704 By doing so, the\ndissent asserted, the Court ″effectively rendered Havner the exclusive measure of proof in toxic tort\ncases,″ in direct conflict with Havner’s ″affirmation that a plaintiff is always free to prove his case by\n″direct, scientifically reliable proof of causation.’″ 705 The dissent concluded that the Bostics had put\nforth such ″direct, scientifically reliable proof″ of both specific and general causation (i.e., that\nasbestos can cause mesothelioma and that asbestos did in fact cause Timothy Bostic’s mesothelioma)\nand thus should not have to satisfy Havner to prove substantial factor causation (i.e., that asbestos from\nGeorgia-Pacific’s product was a substantial cause of his mesothelioma). 706 The dissenting justices\ngenerally agreed with the majority that the determination of whether a particular defendant’s product\nwas a substantial cause of a plaintiff’s disease should be based on evidence relating to the plaintiff’s\naggregate exposure relative to the plaintiff’s exposure to the particular defendant’s products. 707 But\nthey disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the Bostics had failed to offer any dose-quantifying\nevidence, relying on evidence of ″the approximate quantum of time Timothy was exposed to″\nGeorgia-Pacific’s product. 708\n\nRegardless of whether the majority or the dissent in Bostic has the better argument as to whether the\nBostics presented [*128] adequate ″direct″ evidence of causation, the dissent presents a strong\nargument that Havner’s doubling-of-the-risk requirement does not apply to defendant-specific\n702\n      Id. at 16-18. The Court looked at the epidemiological studies underlying the Bostics’ experts’ testimony and concluded that none\nof them supported an association between the disease and the kind of occasional exposure to asbestos to which Bostic testified with\nrespect to Georgia-Pacific’s products. To the contrary, they examined consistent, occupational exposure.

The concurring Justice noted that the Bostics ″offered epidemiological studies of\noccupational exposure that were extrapolated to purportedly measure risk from occasional exposure,″ such as Timothy Bostic’s exposure\nto Georgia-Pacific’s products, but they ″never substantiated those extrapolations, yielding an analytical gap in [their] proof of causation.″\nId. at 20.\n703\n      Id. at 25-37 (Lehrman, J., joined by Boyd, J. and Devine, J., dissenting).\n704\n      Id. at 28.

But it did not agree that the Bostics had presented any direct proof that\nGeorgia-Pacific’s product caused Timothy Bostic’s mesothelioma or that the testimony estimating the period of time over which Timothy\nwas exposed to Georgia-Pacific’s product on some number of occasions amounted to evidence of how much exposure occurred during\nthat period of time.

Georgia-Pacific did not dispute that asbestos causes mesothelioma, nor did it truely\nchallenge the contention that Bostic’s exposure to asbestos had caused his mesothelioma. 709 The\nprincipal dispute in the case was whether Georgia-Pacific’s asbestos-containing products caused\nBostic’s mesothelioma, as opposed to the products of other manufacturers (some of whom had settled\nwith the Bostics), to which Bostic may have had greater exposure. 710 The Court might have reached\nthe same result in the case without extending the Havner requirements to defendant-specific exposure\nlevels (as opposed to aggregate exposure levels) by relying on the considerations espoused in Flores:\nthe Lohrmann ″frequency, regularity, and proximity″ test plus the Restatement (Second) of Torts’\nsubstantial factor requirement. 711 As the dissent noted, by applying Havner to defendant-specific\nexposure levels, Bostic prevents a plaintiff from recovering from any defendant if he was exposed to\nasbestos from multiple products in small amounts, none of which alone more the doubled his risk of\nmesothelioma, but which collectively caused the mesothelioma. 712 An alternative approach would be\nto consider how ″substantial″ the plaintiff’s exposure to an individual defendant’s products is relative\nto his total exposure, which could include exposure to the products of manufacturers with which the\nplaintiff already settled.\n\nFinally, although most of the jurisprudence on epidemiological evidence focuses on the probativeness\nof the studies (i.e., whether they actually tend to prove a causal relationship), courts have also rejected\nepidemiological evidence based on the soundness of the studies (i.e., when they do not bear [*129]\nthe necessary indicia of reliability under Daubert/Havner) regardless of whether the study’s results\nsupport the expert’s conclusion. 713 In Wells v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., the Fifth Circuit applied\nthe Daubert factors to an observational epidemiological study on which the claimant’s expert relied,\nthe ″Weintraub Poster study,″ and found that the study did not pass muster. 714 The claimant in the case\n\n709\n      Id. at 1.\n710\n      Id. at 14-16.\n711\n      Borg-Warner Corp. v.

Essentially, the majority opinion in Bostic effectuates the Restatement (Third)’s ″multiple\nsufficient causes″ exception to the but-for-causation requirement, at least for multi-defendant, asbestos-disease cases. See infra note 794.\nBut this does not account for a scenario in which a disease is caused by exposure to multiple defendants’ products, none of which alone\ndoubled the plaintiff’s relative risk but all of which combined to cause the plaintiff’s disease. A plaintiff who could conclusively prove\nthat his mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos in 200 defendants’ products might nevertheless be unable to recover against\nany defendant (at least in reliance on epidemiological evidence) because his aggregate exposure was significant but his exposure to each\nindividual defendant’s products was minimal. The Restatement (Third) addresses this scenario, to some degree, with its burden-shifting\nrule. See Restatement (Third) of Torts , supra note 570, at §§27, 28.\n713\n       See, e.g., Wells v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 601 F.3d 375, 379-81 (5th Cir. 2010). After noting that epidemiological studies\nrelied on by a testifying expert must be soundly designed and executed, the Havner Court went on to review not the reliability of the\nstudy’s protocols but whether the results of the study had any meaningful bearing on causation, even assuming they were reliably\nproduced. See Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 719-20 (Tex. 1997). Here, courts are not examining the\nmethodology employed by the expert himself, but rather, the methodology employed by the scientists who conducted the epidemiological\nstudy. The Court has said that a testifying expert cannot rely on scientific studies if the scientists who conducted them did not employ\nreasonably sound practices or demonstrated unreasonable bias. See id. at 719.\n714\n      Wells, 601 F.3d at 380. The Weintraub Poster study was a case-controlled observational study. See id. Echoing its statement in\nKnight v.

Resolution of the conflict is an issue for the jury as\nlong as there is reliable evidence on both sides of the issue, even if the evidence on one side is stronger\nthan the evidence on the other side. 723\nomitted) (quoting Knight v.

The WHI study of hormone therapy drugs comprised of\nestrogen and progestin, like Prempro, found that breast cancer rates were lower in women using the drug than women using the placebo\nduring the first two years of use, approximately equal during the third year, and higher in the fourth and subsequent years.

L. Rev. 1, *131\n\n[*131] iii. Animal Studies. Epidemiological studies are often considered the first tier for indirect proof\nof causation in the toxic tort context. 724 When epidemiological studies are unavailable or inconclusive,\nexperts may turn to animal studies. Under the first component of predicative reliability, animal studies\nare subject to the same standards of internal integrity and validity applicable to epidemiological studies\nand all expert evidence generally - they must be properly designed and executed such that they could\nbe reasonably relied upon by experts in the relevant field of expertise. 725 The second component of\npredicative reliability - whether the animal studies actually provide reliable support for the expert’s\ncausation conclusion - is typically less about significance and meaning of the studies in and of\nthemselves and more about the significance of the studies in relation to humans and the facts of the\ncase. 726 For this reason, animal studies are primarily decided under the rubric of the connective\nreliability gate. 727 The question is whether the expert can adequately connect the results of the animal\nstudies to the circumstances of the case, including bridging the anatomical differences between humans\nand the kinds of animals used in the studies.\n\n[*132] One court of appeals has relied on Havner to state broadly that ″animal studies, standing alone,\nare generally held to be inadequate to prove causation in humans absent other confirming\nPrempro, but the women reported their duration of use only at the time they enrolled in the study. Id. at 629. The study showed ″elevated″\nrelative risk of breast cancer among women who reported using the drug for less than a year at the time of enrollment and that ″the breast\ncancers were diagnosed on average 1.2 years after recruitment.″ Id. The claimants’ expert testified that by adding the average 1.2 years\nfrom enrollment to diagnosis, the study could be said to show an elevated risk in less than 2.2 years of use. Id. at 629-30. The third study\ninvolved more than 50,000 French women. Id. at 630. The expert recognized that this approach would result in some ″misclassifications″\nbut that because of the ″very large numbers″ in the study, ″small amounts of misclassifications don’t really make a lot of difference.″\nId.\n\nThe court recognized that most French women use a different formulation than Prempro and that the study did not distinguish between\ndifferent formulations of hormone therapy. Id. The study showed an increased risk of breast cancer among women taking hormone\ntherapy for less than two years when the women began taking the hormone therapy shortly after the onset of menopause. Id. The\nclaimants’ expert noted that the WHI study’s participants were more than ten years past the onset of menopause. Id. at 623. Wyeth argued\nthat the WHI study was a randomized control study, ″the ″gold standard’ of epidemiological studies,″ that disproved the contention that\nshort term use of Prempro could cause breast cancer and that the claimants’ causation expert, who had relied on the WHI study in\nprevious cases, had failed to adequately refute the study’s findings. Id. at 622-23. Wyeth argued that the claimants’ expert had ″cherry\npicked″ the three observational studies on which he relied from ″a wealth of studies″ showing no increased risk of breast cancer from\nshort term use. Id. at 633. The MDL magistrate judge agreed and excluded the expert’s testimony. Id. at 626. The Eight Circuit disagreed.\nId. at 627. The court stated that the claimants did not bear the burden of disproving the WHI study’s finding that short term use of\nPrempro does not increase the risk of breast cancer; as long as their expert ″arrived at his contrary opinion in a scientifically sound and\nmethodological fashion,″ the issue was one of conflicting evidence for the jury to resolve. Id. at 626. The court likewise recognized the\nimperfections in the observational studies on which the claimants’ expert relied, but concluded that they ″were sufficient to support his\nopinion that short term use of Prempro increases the risk of breast cancer.″ Id. at 632. The court indicated that the limitations of the\nstudies on which the expert relied went to the weight to be afforded the expert’s testimony by the jury, and that the ″wealth″ of\nobservational studies Wyeth identified as reaching an opposite conclusion was likewise an issue of conflicting evidence, not\nadmissibility.

L. Rev. 1, *132\n\nepidemiological data.″ 728 Havner is subject to differing constructions. It can be read to hold only that,\nwhen an expert relies on epidemiological evidence as a predicate for a causation opinion in a toxic tort\ncase, the epidemiological evidence does not provide adequate support for the expert’s opinion unless\nit includes at least two studies demonstrating at least a ″doubling of the risk″; or it can be read to hold\nwhen an expert offers a causation opinion in a toxic tort case, the predicate for the opinion must include\nat least two epidemiological studies demonstrating at least a ″doubling of the risk″ - no other predicate\nwill suffice. The second construction of Havner would preclude an expert from ever reaching a\ncausation opinion in a toxic tort case based on animal studies alone. This construction was advanced\nin a case recently decided by the Texas Supreme Court. 729 The Court’s opinion in Bostic establishes\nthat epidemiological evidence is not an absolute requirement for proof of causation in a toxic tort: the\nplaintiff may choose instead to provide ″direct, scientifically reliable proof of causation.″ 730 Havner\n″offers an alternative method of establishing causation″ when such direct proof is not available. 731\n\nWhile Bostic answers the question of whether Havner-satisfying epidemiological evidence is an\nabsolute requirement for causation in toxic tort cases, it does not answer the question of whether\nanimal studies could ever be sufficient in the absence of such epidemiological studies. Bostic\nrecognized an exception for ″direct″ causation evidence, but animal studies, like epidemiological\nstudies, are ″indirect″ causation evidence. Whatever the outcome in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court’s\nrejection of the expert’s reliance on animal studies in Joiner is probably not so broad. The Joiner Court\nexpressly noted that ″whether animal studies can ever be a proper foundation for an expert’s opinion″\nwas not the issue in the case. 732 Instead, the [*133] Court focused on the analytical gap between the\ncircumstances of the animal studies and the circumstances of the case (animal v. human, high\nconcentration v. low concentration), and the expert’s failure to bridge that gap (i.e., connective\nreliability). 733\n\niv.

Rev. 1, *134\n\nfederal court stated that an expert who relies on a published article by another author to provide a\nreliable basis for an opinion must demonstrate that the expert has properly interpreted the article. 744\nAn expert ″cannot use″ an article that expressly refuses to reach a conclusion to support that very\nconclusion. 745 Cited literature that does not support an expert’s opinion is of no aid, 746 nor is literature\nwith its own flaws. 747 One [*135] federal court also examined whether an expert adequately\naddressed literature that reached an opposite conclusion. 748 When literature is deeply divided on an\nissue, experts from both sides must rely on a degree of interpretation of the literature and there is no\nevidence that the literature for one side has flaws not present in the other side’s literature, ″courts are\nnot equipped to″ weigh ″the relative persuasive power″ of the competing studies. 749\n\nv. Material Safety Data Sheets and Safety Standards. Experts sometimes rely on federal regulations\n(particularly from the EPA, FDA, or OSHA), warnings provided by governmental or private entities,\nand material safety data sheets (MSDS) to infer a causal relationship between a particular substance\nand a particular illness or injury. Some courts have, for example, concluded that information from a\nchemical’s MSDS can, in some cases, provide an adequate predicate for identifying a chemical as a\npotential cause, particularly when combined with other support. 750 But like federal regulations and\nhealth warnings, an MSDS is not designed to establish causation. Courts have generally allowed\nMSDSs and other types of formalized health warnings to serve as a predicate for expert opinions on\ncausation only when the MSDS provide sufficient factual information to support the expert’s analysis.\n751\n\n\n\nDavid Bernstein has observed that the considerations that govern a governmental agency’s adoption of\na safety standard differ in material ways from the considerations that govern the law’s imposition of\nliability. 752\n\nWhere government agencies are charged with proactively protecting the public health from potential\ntoxic threats, agencies often have no choice but to rely on scientists’ best guesses in the face of\n743\n      McClain v.

But such best guesses are not admissible in toxic tort cases, where the law\ndemands reliable expert testimony regarding causation. 753\n\n[*136] A Texas court of appeals echoed these sentiments in Makofski, rejecting the use of the EPA’s\n″lower standards″ because ″differences in costs and benefits make false positives acceptable in some\nsituations but unacceptable in others.″ 754 The court observed that ″it may be appropriate for the EPA\nto protect people from chemical exposure on weak evidence that it will cause any harm, but that does\nnot make it equally appropriate to impose a judgment of several million dollars on weak evidence that\na defendant caused any harm.″ 755 In Moore v. Ashland Chemical, Inc., the Fifth Circuit affirmed the\nexclusion of differential diagnosis testimony when the physician ruled in a particular chemical as a\npotential cause of the claimant’s RADS based on a statement in the chemical’s MSDS that\noverexposure to the chemical could cause injury to the lungs depending on the concentration and\nduration of exposure. 756 Because the risk identified in the MSDS depended on the concentration and\nduration of exposure but the MSDS did not identify the degree of concentration or level of exposure\nnecessary to give rise to the risk, the expert could not rule in the chemical as a potential cause of RADS\nbased on the MSDS alone. 757 A Texas court of appeals relied on Moore to reach the same conclusion\nin Brookshire Bros., Inc. v. Smith, when an expert opined that a commercial cleaner caused the\nplaintiff’s RADS based in part on the cleaner’s MSDS and warning labels. 758 The court stated that\n″neither the MSDS nor the warning labels, standing alone, provide the type of specific, detailed\nshowing of scientific reliability required to accord evidentiary value to an expert’s opinion.″ 759 The\ncourt further noted that ″there was no evidence produced at trial that discussed the scientific foundation\nused in formulating the conclusions contained in either the MSDS or the warning labels.″ 760\n\n\n\n\n753\n      Id.

Arkema, the Fifth Circuit stated that an MSDS is not ″per se reliable\nsupport for an expert’s opinion,″ 761 nor are exposure level standards imposed by OSHA and the\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 762\n\nIn Coastal Tankships, U.S.A., Inc. v. Anderson, a Texas appellate court held, en banc, that the trial court\nhad abused its discretion in allowing the plaintiff’s medical expert to testify that exposure to the\nchemical naphtha caused the plaintiff’s pneumonia based on the plaintiff’s medical records, the MSDS\nfor naphtha, and lay testimony that the plaintiff was healthy before inhaling the naphtha fumes but\nbecame ill soon afterward. 763 The court observed that ″no expert established that [the treating\nphysician’s] diagnostic records, the naphtha MSDS, or any other nonexpert evidence on which [the\ntestifying expert] now relies met the appropriate Daubert/Robinson/Jordan inquiry as to general\ncausation,″ and this was ″fatal to [the expert’s] claims.″ 764\n\nBut ten years after Coastal Tankships, a panel from the same court allowed a chemist to rely on\ninformation in a chemical’s MSDS in reaching his conclusion that the chemical caused a fire in Control\nSolutions, Inc. v. Gharda USA, Inc. 765 In Control Solutions, the expert was a forensic chemist and\nchemical fire expert who did not rely exclusively or even primarily on the MSDS to support a causation\nconclusion; instead, he relied on the MSDS as supplying data about the chemical (particularly the\ntemperature at which it would thermally decompose) that he used as a basis for further research. 766\n\n [*138] Similarly, in Best v. Lowes Home Centers, Inc., the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that\na physician could properly rule in EZ Aqua as a potential cause of the claimant’s anosmia based in part\non the EZ Aqua’s MSDS statement that it is ″irritating to the mucous membrane and upper respiratory\ntract″ and ″may be harmful if inhaled,″ but also based on the physician’s experience and knowledge\nof anosmia and its causal relationship to chlorine derivatives like that contained in EZ Aqua. 767 The\nBest court relied on a Second Circuit Court of Appeals case, McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., in which\nthe claimant had developed throat polyps after exposure to hot glue fumes. 768 The McCullock court\npermitted physician testimony that the hot glue fumes had caused the polyps when the physician relied\n761\n      See Johnson v.

L. Rev. 1, *138\n\non the MSDS, as well as ″pathological studies,″ the patient’s medical history, and the expert’s\nexperience and training. 769 Similarly, in Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, the court allowed a\nphysician to rely on a statement in the MSDS for talc that inhalation of talc dust ″in high concentrations\nirritates mucous membranes″ to ″rule in″ talc as a potential cause of the claimant’s sinus condition\nwhen there was evidence that the claimant was exposed to ″very high levels of airborne talc throughout\nhis workday.″ 770\nIn sum, an expert generally may rely on an MSDS to provide factual information about a particular\nchemical. The expert may then apply her own methodology and analysis to reach a conclusion on\ncausation based, in whole or in part, on those facts. But an MSDS is not designed for the purpose of\nestablishing causation. When an expert attempts to rely on an MSDS not for discrete data but to supply\na conclusion on causation, the MSDS must stand up to the same standards applicable to any expert\nopinion on causation; i.e., the proffering party must demonstrate the predicative, methodological, and\nconnective reliability of the analysis that led to the conclusion in the MSDS regarding causation.\nIn some cases, experts have attempted to rely on federal health and safety regulations and standards\nas a predicate for ruling in potential causes of a claimant’s injury or illness in differential diagnosis\ntestimony. Courts have admitted expert testimony predicated on federal regulations or safety standards\n [*139] set by federal health-or safety-related agencies as part of a larger body of scientific literature\ndemonstrating that ″it is generally accepted in the medical community″ that exposure to a particular\nsubstance can cause a particular illness. 771 But like an MSDS, health and safety regulations and\nstandards are not designed for the purpose of establishing a causal connection between a substance and\na disease. They thus generally are not, alone, a sufficient predicate for an expert’s opinion on general\ncausation. In Pluck v. BP Oil Pipeline Co., the testifying physician ″ruled in″ the claimant’s exposure\nto benzene as a potential cause of her Parkinson’s disease based on an EPA safety regulation stating\nthat the maximum permissible contaminant level for benzene in drinking water is five ppb. 772 But the\nphysician was unable to determine the claimant’s level of exposure and did not have a basis for\nconcluding that she was ever exposed to benzene at a level equal to or in excess of five ppb. 773 The\ncourt held that evidence that benzene was unsafe in certain dosages did not provide a reliable basis for\n″ruling in″ benzene as a potential cause of the claimant’s injury when there was no basis for concluding\nthat the claimant was exposed to the unsafe dosage. 774\nThe fatal defect in both Moore and Pluck was the absence of necessary ″dosage″ data - either the data\nnecessary to determine at what dosage a substance poses a particular danger or data necessary to\n769\n      McCullock, 61 F.3d. at 1041, 1044.\n770\n      Westberry v.

Rev. 1, *139\n\ndetermine whether the claimant was exposed to the dosage at which the substance poses the danger.\n775\n     This has been a recurring theme in recent toxic tort cases. 776 Claimants in such [*140] cases\nshould endeavor to prove that either (1) the substance in question is capable of causing the type of\ninjury he suffered at any dosage; or (2) the substance in question is capable of causing the type of\ninjury he suffered at a particular dosage and his exposure met or exceeded that dosage. But precise\nexposure data is not always essential to differential diagnosis testimony. 777 In Westberry, for example,\nevidence of ″very high levels″ of exposure to airborne talc, including testimony that talc settling from\nthe air around the claimant’s workspace onto the floor was ″so thick one could see footprints in it,″ was\nsufficient when supplied with evidence that ″high concentrations″ could cause the kind of injury\nsuffered by the claimant. 778\nBut even if exposure data is included in a federal safety standard, the standard will not supply an\nadequate predicate for ″ruling in″ a potential cause if it is not adequately tied to the applicable legal\nstandards for causation. In Glastetter v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals\nupheld the exclusion of a claimant’s medical experts on the ground that they lacked a reliable basis for\nruling in the drug in question, Parlodel, as potential cause of the claimant’s ICH. 779 Among the\npredicates on which the claimant’s experts relied was the FDA’s 1994 rescission of its earlier approval\nof Parlodel as a treatment for postpartum lactation, for which purpose the claimant had used Parlodel.\n780\n    After evaluating the available medical literature, the FDA had ″concluded that Parlodel might cause\nseizures or strokes in women already susceptible to disease″ and ″decided that ″the potential risks\n [*141] associated with the use of bromocriptine for the prevention of physiological lactation outweigh\nits limited benefits and bromocriptine is no longer shown to be safe for use in preventing physiological\nlactation.’″ 781 The court observed that such balancing was ″irrelevant″ to the issue of whether the\nclaimant’s experts properly ″ruled in″ Parlodel as a potential cause and that the FDA’s decision to\nremove Parlodel from the market rested ″upon a lesser showing of harm to the public than the\n\n\n775\n      Moore v.

Another Expert’s Opinion. When parties offer multiple experts to opine on different issues, it is not\nnecessary that each expert’s opinion stands or falls on its own. Experts are permitted to predicate their\nopinions on the opinions and findings offered by other experts in the case. 784 The danger in this\napproach is that if the underlying expert’s opinion is excluded or deemed to constitute no evidence, the\ndependent expert opinion will likely also be excluded or deemed no evidence, unless the expert has\nprovided other, independently sufficient support for his opinion. 785 Additionally, an expert may not\nmerely ″parrot″ the opinion of another expert; each expert must be giving his own opinion. 786\n\n [*142]\n\nb.

For example, in Total Clean, LLC v.

Jackson 822 for the proposition that\n″recovery of lost profits is allowed where a business is established on the strength of a contract but is\ndiscontinued because of its breach.″ 823 The court of appeals held that the plaintiff could not rely on\nthat principle because its business was not established on the basis of the contract on which the expert\nrelied; to the contrary, the business had been in operation (operating at a loss) for years. 824 As in Total\nClean, the Capital Metro court criticized the expert for basing his calculations on a number of\nperformance assumptions, at the plaintiff’s instruction, without independently investigating and\nconfirming the numbers. 825\n\nMeasuring lost profits, however, is an ″inherently speculative undertaking.″ 826 In making such\nmeasurements, an expert may rely on assumptions that are reasonable and consistent with the facts of\nthe case.

SPM Flow Control, Inc., for example, an appellate court concluded\nthat an expert’s lost profits opinion was reliable even though the expert did not determine all of the\ndetails of potential sales. 827 For example, one component of the expert’s lost profits calculation was\nbased on profits lost from (due to the other party’s fault) quoting prices that were too high or delivery\ntimes that were too long to suit the company’s customers, but the expert admitted he did not determine\nwhat price or delivery time would have induced the party’s customers to buy from it. 828 The expert\nhad personally contacted customers to determine the cause of their cancellations and calculated the\nresulting lost profits based on the company’s existing margin data. 829 The other components of the\nexpert’s lost profits opinion were likewise based on the company’s existing production rates, shop rates\n(which the expert had determined to be industry standard and independently examined to ensure\naccuracy), sales history, and [*149] profit margin. 830 The court noted that the company had been\nprofitable for years and stated that the expert’s calculations were reliably based on ″proven products″\nand ″existing customers.″ 831\n819\n      Id. at 580.\n820\n      Id. at 581-82.\n821\n      Id. at 579-80.\n822\n      Pace Corp. v.

L. Rev. 1, *149\n\nRule 703 permits experts to draw inferences from the factual record in the case, 832 but the Texas\nSupreme Court has constrained expert inferences in much the same way it has constrained expert\nopinions generally: an expert cannot merely draw possible inferences from the facts and state a\nconclusion; instead, the expert must provide the jury with the basis for his inferences. 833 Thus, in\nJelinek v. Casas, the Court said,\n\nWhen the only evidence of a vital fact is circumstantial, the expert cannot merely draw possible\ninferences from the evidence and state that ″in medical probability″ the injury was caused by the\ndefendant’s negligence. The expert must explain why the inferences drawn are medically preferable to\ncompeting inferences that are equally consistent with the known facts. Thus, when the facts support\nseveral possible conclusions, only some of which establish that the defendant’s negligence caused the\nplaintiff’s injury, the expert must explain to the fact finder why those conclusions are superior based\non verifiable medical evidence, not simply the expert’s opinion. 834\n\nWhen facts give rise to equal inferences - i.e., when they are consistent with the opinion formed by\nthe expert but also equally consistent with an opposing conclusion - they will not provide an adequate\nbasis for the expert’s opinion. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 835 discussed above, 836 a key fault\nin the plaintiffs’ expert’s theory about what caused a home fire was that the factual evidence on which\nthe expert relied to support his theory was equally consistent with the defendant’s expert’s alternative\ntheory about what caused the fire. 837\n\nFinally, while experts may draw inferences from the facts of the case, 838 the general rule that ″an\ninference may not be based upon another inference″ 839 applies to expert evidence - experts [*150]\nmay not ″pile inference upon inference.″ 840 Nor may courts supply inferences on an expert’s behalf\nin order to fill material gaps in the expert’s testimony. 841\n832\n      Tex.

In Kumho, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the requirements of Daubert and its\nprogeny are not limited to scientific expert testimony; they also apply to technical, nonscientific expert\ntestimony. 850 The Texas Supreme Court reached the same conclusion a year earlier, holding in\nGammill that an expert may base his opinion on his own experience, training, and skill, but the\nproffering party must still establish the reliability of the expert’s basis. 851 The Texas Supreme Court\n [*152] held that an expert’s experience does not excuse the expert from identifying a valid predicate\nfor his opinion or, as discussed below, 852 from adequately connecting his opinions to that predicate\nand to the facts of the case. The Court emphasized this point in Whirlpool:\n\nWitnesses offered as experts in an area or subject will invariably have experience in that field. If courts\nmerely accept ″experience″ as a substitute for proof that an expert’s opinions are reliable and then only\nexamine the testimony for analytical gaps in the expert’s logic and opinions, an expert can effectively\ninsulate his or her conclusions from meaningful review by filling gaps in the testimony with almost any\ntype of data or subjective opinions. 853\n\nThus, ″while an expert’s overwhelming qualifications may bear on the reliability of his proffered\ntestimony, they are by no means a guarantor of reliability.″ 854 A very qualified expert may ″still offer\nunreliable testimony.″ 855 Strong qualifications do not save an otherwise unreliable opinion. 856\n849\n      Dart v.

This requirement\ntypically is not satisfied by a ″random experience″ or an ″isolated case.″ 875 And courts frequently\ndemand disclosure of the specifics of an expert’s predicative experiences; vague recollections may be\ndeemed insufficient to support the expert’s opinion. 876\nBut extensive ″experience can suffice to validate a proposition even when the experience cannot be\nprecisely [*156] quantified.″ 877 Courts could look to a number of facts to determine the sufficiency\nof the quantity of experience. The publication Daubert factor may have some potential applicability for\ndetermining the sufficiency of an expert’s experience. An expert who has published his experience has\ngiven some objective criteria outside the litigation context of the experience and has subjected that\nexperience to comparison by other experts. However, experts may have vast experience without\npublishing an article describing their experience.\nTo evaluate the sufficiency of the experience, courts should require an expert to identify examples of\nher experience because the reliability inquiry does not blindly accept an expert’s claim of predicate\ndata without inquiry. 878 Thus, an expert’s declaration that a term has an industry meaning or that a\npractice is standard is insufficient; the expert needs to present some support for the declaration. 879 ″If\nthe witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, then the witness must explain how that\nexperience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion,\nand how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.″ 880 ″It is not enough for the expert to explain\nthat he or she is resting the opinion on his or her education or experience.″ 881 ″The trial court’s\n\n873\n      Cf. id.\n874\n      Cf. id.\n875\n      Minn.

These clues are plausible and widely accepted by fire department arson\ninvestigators. The difficulty, though, is that there have been few ″full-scale burns″ of buildings to\nverify that such factors accurately identify the starting place of a fire. To make matters worse, ″nothing\nin the natural world ″tests’ an arson investigator’s expertise. If an arson investigator is wrong, nothing\nruns aground or burns down.″ These clues are in widespread use, but there is little objective evidence\nthat their use yields accurate results. Without any effort to detect error and evaluate the results of the\nuse of the technique, the analysts might simply be repeating the same mistakes over and over again.\n884\n\n\n\n″While the relevant factors for determining reliability will vary from expertise to expertise,″ the\nAdvisory Committee’s notes state that Rule 702\n\nrejects the premise that an expert’s testimony should be treated more permissively simply because it\nis outside the realm of science. An opinion from an expert who is not a scientist should receive the\nsame degree of scrutiny for reliability as an opinion from an expert who purports to be a scientist. 885\n\nProfessor Imwinkelried gives a helpful illustration demonstrating the need to establish an adequate\namount of experience for experience-based expert testimony:\n\nSuppose, for instance, that in a contract lawsuit, there is a dispute over the meaning of a term in the\nwritten agreement. To support her interpretation of the term, the plaintiff calls an experienced member\nof the industry as an expert witness. The witness proposes to testify that within the industry, there is\na trade custom or usage as to the meaning of that term. The expert’s specific theory is that [*158] the\nusage exists within the industry. So long as the witness testifies that he or she has been a member of\nthe industry for a certain period of time and has encountered that usage of the term on several occasions\nby industry members, the foundation ought to be deemed adequate.

L. Rev. 1, *158\n\nIn this illustration, the proponent of the expert testimony wants the witness to ″merely recite or\nsummarize experience as to fact A.″ 887 In these situations, the testimony is descriptive and should be\npermitted provided ″the witness has had a large number of similar experiences as to fact A.″ 888\n\nIn other situations, ″the proponent contemplates inviting the expert to draw an inference from the\nwitness’s experience. The expert evaluates the experience and draws a further inference as to fact B.″\n889\n    An example would be when a physician describes her experience performing a particular procedure\nand then draws an inference regarding the standard of care for a reasonably prudent physician. The\nphysician’s experience alone is insufficient to make a logical inferential determination that her practice\nis the same as the standard of care, that requires evidence of what other physicians do or do not do\nunder the same or similar circumstances. When experience is used as the basis for a medical causation\nopinion, the expert is also making an inferential determination based on that experience. In that\nsituation, ″one or a few isolated anecdotes should not suffice.″ 890 Instead, courts should first ″insist[]\nupon a showing of ″many instances’ - a definite pattern of consistent outcomes - before they [are]\nwilling to infer a relationship or connection.″ 891 Additionally, courts ″should demand proof of the\nresults″ of the expert’s experience. 892\n\nIn each of these situations, experience is not operating as a factor supporting the reliability of an\nexpert’s methodology. Rather, the expert’s experience is operating as a basis for the opinion, by\nproviding data gathered through the expert’s personal experience, by using the expert’s experience as\na methodology for analyzing the data in the case, or both. And as discussed below, experience can also\nfunction as the connection [*159] or link between an expert’s methodology or predicate data to the\nexpert’s conclusion when an expert must extrapolate from either of those two bases to reach her\nconclusion. 893 At least one legal authority has observed that what we refer to in this Article as\n″connective reliability″ plays a particularly important role in assessing experience-based opinions. 894\n\nii.

Krist, the Elizondos sued their former attorneys,\nalleging that the attorneys had settled their personal injury claims against BP Amoco Chemical\nCompany for less than the claims were worth. 907 The Elizondos’ underlying claims against BP arose\nout of an explosion at BP’s Texas City refinery that gave rise to approximately 4,000 claims against\nBP, all of which BP settled. 908 The Elizondos attempted to demonstrate damages for their malpractice\nclaim through the affidavit of an attorney-expert who had represented a number of other claimants\nagainst BP in these settlements. 909 The expert identified ten factors that BP had considered in\ndetermining the settlement value of claims like the Elizondos’ and concluded that the Elizondos’\nformer attorneys had breached the standard of care by settling the Elizondos’ claims against BP for $\n50,000, which he described as ″basically … nuisance value,″ because he placed the actual settlement\nvalue of the claims between two and three million dollars. 910 The expert predicated his opinion on the\nfacts of the case, his ″experience in the BP litigation,″ his ″knowledge of general settlement values,″\nand ″the criteria and protocol relied upon to establish general settlement values in the BP litigation.″\n911\n    Essentially, the expert used BP’s ten settlement-evaluation criteria to compare the Elizondos’\nclaims to other claims BP settled after the refinery explosion and determined that the Elizondos’ claims\nwere settled for much less than other comparable claims. 912 The Court held that the expert testimony\nwas conclusory under a connective reliability analysis, 913 but the Court specifically approved of the\nattorney’s use of other settlements as factual predicates for his opinion on the value of the Elizondos’\nunderlying claims:\nUnder Evidence Rule 703, experts may base their testimony on facts or data that are ″of a type\nreasonably relied upon [*162] by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon\nthe subject.″ That test is met when, in a mass tort litigation involving thousands of similar claimants\nand arising out of the same event, the expert measures the ″true″ settlement value of a particular case\n905\n       Id. at 762-63 (″While Texas courts have not routinely required billing records or other documentary evidence to substantiate a claim\nfor attorney’s fees, the requirement has merit in contested cases under the lodestar approach… . [The] proof should include the basic\nfacts underlying the lodestar, which are: (1) the nature of the work, (2) who performed the services and their rate, (3) approximately when\nthe services were performed, and (4) the number of hours worked. An attorney could, of course, testify to these details, but in all but\nthe simplest cases, the attorney would probably have to refer to some type of record or documentation to provide this information. Thus,\nwhen there is an expectation that the lodestar method will be used to calculate fees, attorneys should document their time much as they\nwould for their own clients, that is, contemporaneous billing records or other documentation recorded reasonably close to the time when\nthe work is performed.″).\n906\n      Elizondo v.

But sometimes both experience and\npredicative data are available, and in those cases, a court may wish to consider both. For example, an\nattorney may testify that a billing rate is ″standard″ or ″reasonable″ in a community for an attorney\nwith a certain level of experience. 916 The attorney’s testimony is not reliable ″if the attorney only\nknows the hourly rate charged by the attorneys handling the dispute and by the expert’s colleagues in\nhis or her own law firm.″ 917 But he may know the fees charged by other attorneys. And the\nexpert-attorney may have data available on attorney’s billing rates from the Texas Lawyer. There may\nalso be a question of connective reliability - the expert may not have any experience with the particular\ntype of case and may have to extrapolate from other cases or may have billing rate data from one area\nof the state but not from the county of the lawsuit. Finally, although the conclusory nature of an\nattorney’s opinion on the reasonableness of attorney’s fees should, in theory, depend solely on the\nproffered opinion and support for it, whether the sufficiency of the evidence on fees was contested at\ntrial and the degree to which the opinion testimony was challenged by the opposing party seem to play\na [*163] meaningful role in the degree of scrutiny applied by appellate courts.\n\nFinally, whether offered by an attorney or another type of expert, an opinion based on an erroneous\ninterpretation of a contract 918 or the law 919 is not reliable. 920\n\niii.

We discuss legal expert testimony in detail below. See infra notes 1458-67 and accompanying text.\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 125 of 230\n                                                       52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *163\n\ndemonstrate that such a defect caused a plaintiff’s injury. The principles of mathematics and physics\non which such experts base their opinions (methodological reliability) are sometimes well established\nand unquestioned; 921 in those cases, challenges to the expert testimony are frequently based on the\ndata the expert plugged into the equation (predicative reliability), the assumptions on which the\nequation was based (predicative reliability), or the ″fit″ between the factual predicate of the expert’s\nopinion and the actual facts of the case (connective reliability). 922 Although the first and third focuses\noverlap, our focus in this section is on opinion testimony lacking a factual predicate - i.e., when the\ndata the expert plugged into the calculations or the assumptions on which the calculations were based\nare unsupported by, or inconsistent with, the evidence in the case.\nIn Whirlpool, for example, the plaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony of an electrical engineer\nto prove a design defect. 923 [*164] The engineer testified that the fire in the plaintiffs’ home started\nwhen lint particles in their Whirlpool-manufactured clothes dryer ignited the clothes in the dryer. 924\nThe expert presented a detailed process by which the fire could have started in the dryer: the dryer’s\ncorrugated tube allowed lint to hang up on the inside of the tube and clog it; the clogged tube caused\nlint to back up into the blower housing assembly, from which excessive amounts of it escaped by being\nblown through a gasket-like seal between the lint chute and the blower housing (the ″lint chute seal″),\nand into the dryer cabinet; the lint was then forced through the lint chute seal, became airborne, and\nwas drawn into the heater box; some airborne lint particles then passed through the heater box, were\nignited as they passed by the heater element, and traveled vertically to the inlet grill; there, the lint\nparticles either entered the drum or came into contact with and ignited other lint that had become\nattached to the inlet grill, and then the newly-ignited lint entered the rotating drum; once the ignited\nlint was in the dryer drum, it landed in the drying, tumbling clothes, and smoldered there through the\nremainder of the drying and cool-down cycles and the period of time after the dryer shut off; when one\nof the plaintiffs opened the dryer door, oxygen entered the drum and the increased oxygen level\nallowed the smoldering lint and clothes to burst into flames. 925\nBut the Texas Supreme Court held that the expert’s testimony was ″conclusory″ and ″not entitled to\nprobative weight″ because of the inadequacy of the predicate on which his opinion rested. 926 First,\nwhile a clogged lint tube might cause the kind of back up the engineer described, there was no basis\nfor concluding that the plaintiff’s lint tube was clogged. 927 The tube had been destroyed in the fire,\nso the engineer examined the transport tube from an ″exemplar″ dryer. 928 But the ″exemplar″ dryer\n\n\n921\n      Other times, however, engineering experts’ methodologies are challenged. For example, when the expert failed to conduct any\nphysical testing or support theoretical calculations and models. See infra note 1247 and accompanying text (stating that courts often rely\non the absence of testing in concluding that an expert’s testimony is unreliable).\n922\n      See supra Part III.B.2 (discussing the relevancy and importance of factual predicates of an expert’s opinion and cases where an\nexpert’s opinion relies on false facts or assumptions).\n923\n      Whirlpool Corp. v.

L. Rev. 1, *164\n\nwas used under different conditions and in a different manner. 929 Importantly, the ″exemplar″ dryer\nhad not been properly vented, and the engineer could not provide any basis for concluding that a lint\ntransport tube would become clogged if properly vented, as the plaintiffs’ had been. 930 And there was\nevidence that the [*165] plaintiffs’ dryer had been serviced before the fire, at which time the dryer’s\ncabinet had been vacuumed out. 931 Second, the engineer relied on certain lint-ignition tests to\nconclude that lint in the plaintiffs’ dryer could have ignited in the heater box and then passed through\nthe inlet grill to ignite clothes in the dryer. 932 But the tests involved dryers that were designed\ndifferently than the plaintiffs’ dryer - particularly in that they did not have an inlet grill separating the\nheating element from the clothing. 933 Whirlpool presented evidence that the inlet grill would have\nprevented lint particles large enough to ignite clothing from passing through. 934 The engineer did not\nexplain how the smaller particles that could have passed through the inlet grill in the plaintiffs’ dryer\ncould have ignited clothing. 935 Because it was based on the unsupported assumptions that the lint\ntransport tube was clogged and that large lint particles could have passed through the dryer’s inlet grill,\nthe expert testimony in Whirlpool lacked predicative reliability (as well as connective reliability, as\ndiscussed below). 936\niv. Accident Reconstruction Technical Predicates. Accident reconstructionists also often rely on\nphysics and mathematical predicates, as well as their experience, for their opinions about how an\naccident came to pass. The Texas Supreme Court provided a useful comparison of expert testimony in\nproduct liability cases in TXI Transportation, discussing two of the Court’s prior cases involving\naccident reconstruction expert testimony as exemplars of when such testimony is reliable and when it\nis not. 937 In both cases, the principal issue was whether [*166] the failure of a defective mechanical\npart was the cause of the accident or was caused by the accident, but the Court found the expert\ntestimony reliable in one case (Ledesma) and unreliable in the other (Ramirez). 938\nIn Ledesma, the expert, a metallurgical and mechanical engineer, opined that a u-bolt on the plaintiff’s\ntruck became under-torqued on the rear leaf spring and axle assembly causing the axle assembly to\n929\n      Id.\n930\n       Id. Notably, the ″analytical gap″ between the circumstances of the exemplar dryer and the circumstances of the plaintiff’s dryer\nleft the expert with no predicate for his opinion that the dryer’s transport tube became clogged. See id. at 639-40.\n931\n      Id.\n932\n      Id. at 640-41.\n933\n      Id. at 641.\n934\n      Id.\n935\n       Id. Here again, the plaintiffs’ expert lacked any predicate for his assumption (that lint ignited clothing in the dryer) because the\nonly predicate that the expert had (the lint-ignition tests) lacked connective reliability - i.e., the expert failed to explain why the ″gap″\nbetween dryers with inlet grill and dryers without an inlet grill was not material to his theory of the fire. See id. The Court agreed with\nthe plaintiffs that ″testing is not always required to support an expert’s opinion,″ but the Court qualified that standard by stating that when\ntesting is possible, the lack of such testing ″is one factor that points toward a determination that an expert opinion is unreliable.″ Id. at\n642. The Court also criticized the expert’s opinion on methodological reliability grounds and connective reliability grounds. See id. at\n642-43; infra notes 1259-66, 1646-56 and accompanying text (discussing Whirlpool).\n936\n      Connective reliability is discussed in detail later in this article. See infra Part III.D.\n937\n      TXI Transp. Co. v. Hughes, 306 S.W.3d 230, 239-40 (Tex. 2010) (comparing Ford Motor Co. v. Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d 32, 40-41\n(Tex. 2007) with Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d 897, 906 (Tex. 2004)).\n938\n      TXI Transp., 306 S.W.3d at 239-40; Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d at 40-41; Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 906.\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 127 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *166\n\ncome apart, which in turn caused the drive shaft to separate from the transmission such that the plaintiff\nlost control of the truck. 939 In Ramirez, the expert, an accident reconstructionist, opined that a bearing\ndefect in the left rear wheel assembly of the plaintiff’s car caused the left rear wheel to become\ndetached from the car’s axle, which in turn caused the plaintiff to lose control of the car. 940 The\ndifference between the two exemplars of expert evidence was that the expert in Ledesma ″supported\nhis theory with observations and measurements from the physical evidence and the manufacturer’s\nown specifications″ and ″pointed to other physical evidence to support his theory regarding the u-bolt’s\nfailure as the triggering event for the accident.″ 941 The expert in Ramirez, by comparison, ″proposed\nthe ″laws of physics’ explained his assumption, but did not connect his theory to any physical evidence\nin the case or to any tests or calculations prepared to substantiate his theory″; to the contrary, the expert\ncould not logically reconcile certain facts about the accident site with his theory of how the accident\nhappened. 942 The Court concluded that the expert opinion testimony offered in TXI Transportation,\nlike that in Ledesma, was ″neither conclusory nor subjective″ because the expert’s ″observations,\nmeasurements, and calculations were tied to the physical evidence in the case which likewise provided\nsupport for his conclusions and theory.″ 943\n\n [*167] While TXI Transportation and Ledesma indicate that expert opinions about how an accident\ncame to pass must be tied to the physical evidence in the case, Texas courts have not required that the\nconnection be perfect or the best available. In Lincoln v. Clark Freight Lines, Inc., the court of appeals\nrejected a challenge to accident reconstruction testimony from an experienced deputy on the ground\nthat the deputy had determined the hardness of the vehicle’s tire rubber (for purposes of determining\nthe coefficient of friction) by ″eyeballing the tires″ rather than using a Durometer. 944 The court\ndetermined that the expert could rely on his ″years of experience testing the coefficient of friction with\n″similar tires’ … [which] supplied scientific proof that the [test car’s] drag coefficient would be similar\nto that of the [plaintiff’s car].″ 945 The court concluded that the trial court did not err in finding that\nthe expert’s testimony was not based on merely subjective belief or unsupported speculation. 946\n\nv. Damages Technical and Experiential Predicates. Like engineering experts, damages experts often\nrely on technical predicates to calculate damages - frequently, principles of finance and mathematics\n\n939\n      Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d at 37-38.\n940\n      Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 902, 904.\n941\n      TXI Transp., 306 S.W.3d at 239 (citing Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d at 37-38).\n942\n      Id. (citing Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 904-06).\n943\n       Id. at 240. The flaw in the expert evidence in Ramirez could be viewed as a lack of predicative reliability - the expert had no basis\nfor concluding that the left rear wheel became detached before the accident. See Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 904-06. But it is better viewed\nas a lack of connective reliability because there was evidence in the case from which a hypothesis could be made on the issue - most\nnotably, the location of the wheel at the accident scene. See id. The problem for the plaintiff was that this evidence was contrary to, rather\nthan supportive of, the expert’s theory of the accident; his theory of the accident simply did not fit the facts of the case. See id.; see also\ninfra notes 1616-32 (discussing connective reliability in Ramirez).\n944\n      Lincoln v. Clark Freight Lines, Inc., 285 S.W.3d 79, 85, 89, 91 (Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.).\n945\n      Id. at 89-90.\n946\n      Id. at 91.\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 128 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *167\n\nthat are well established and unquestioned. 947 Thus, in this category of expert testimony too,\nchallenges are sometimes based on the data the expert plugged into the equation or the assumptions\non which the equation was based (predicative reliability). 948\nFederal courts have afforded damages experts some leeway in determining what data to use in damages\ncalculations. For example, in Manpower, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, the Seventh Circuit\noverturned a district court’s exclusion of an expert’s opinion of the plaintiff’s business interruption\nlosses, calculated using a growth rate extrapolation methodology. 949 The expert’s methodology was\nsound and was not the subject of the [*168] district court’s concern. 950 Instead, the issue was whether\nthe data points used by the expert in his calculations were sufficiently reliable. 951 The Seventh Circuit\nsaid that ″the reliability of data and assumptions used in applying a methodology is tested by the\nadversarial process and determined by the jury; the court’s role is generally limited to assessing the\nreliability of the methodology - the framework - of the expert’s analysis.″ 952 The court clarified that\nan expert may not rely on data ″that has no quantitative or qualitative connection to the methodology\nemployed,″ 953 but rather, must rely on the ″kinds of facts or data on which experts in the field would\nreasonably rely.″ 954\nBecause Texas courts are not limited to pre-admission review of reliability and may also test reliability\nposttrial through a legal-sufficiency challenge, the data underlying an expert’s damages opinion is\nsubject to scrutiny in light of the facts developed at trial. 955 Consistent with the Seventh Circuit’s\ncaution that foundational data for an expert opinion cannot be quantitatively or qualitatively\ndisconnected from the facts of the case, Texas courts have rejected damages opinions based on an\nacceptable methodology when the predicative data used in the calculations lacks sufficient similarity\nor comparability to the facts of the case. 956 For example, in Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority v.\nKraft, the Texas Supreme Court held that a trial court erred in admitting the testimony of a damages\n947\n      See, e.g., Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth. v. Kraft, 77 S.W.3d 805, 808 (Tex. 2002) (acknowledging the use of comparable sales\nto be an approved methodology to value the fair market value of property); Koko Motel, Inc. v. Mayo, 91 S.W.3d 41, 51 (Tex. App. -\nAmarillo 2000, pet. denied).\n948\n      See Manpower, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of Pa., 732 F.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir. 2013) (stating that the district court accepted the methodology\nas sound but excluded the testimony because of the data used).\n949\n      Id. at 808, 810.

Texas courts have\nobserved that the sales data on which the expert relies for comparison must have similar characteristics to the property at issue. See City\nof Harlingen v. Estate of Sharboneau, 48 S.W.3d 177, 182 (Tex. 2001) (″Comparable sales must be voluntary, and should take place near\nin time to the condemnation, occur in the vicinity of the condemned property, and involve land with similar characteristics.″); see also\nWilliams v. State, 406 S.W.3d 273, 285 (Tex.

Humphrey, the Beaumont Court of Appeals held that a trial court\nerred by admitting opinion testimony from a real estate appraiser regarding diminution in the market\nvalue of the plaintiff’s home as a result of flooding. 961 The expert testified that ″flood stigma″ had\ncaused a 20% decline in the plaintiff’s home value, which the expert testified would continue to affect\nthe home’s value even after the cause of the flooding was fixed. 962 With regard to the predicate for\nhis opinion, the expert testified that he had dealt with over one hundred properties that had incurred\nflood damage, but in reaching the 20% figure, he conceded that he did not use other flooded properties\nas a comparison; nor did he identify any data supporting his calculation or any properties that he\nclaimed suffered similar flood damage. 963 Instead, he testified that his opinion was based on ″much\nconversation, particularly, over the years with realtors that sell these properties″ and on his experience\nin selling flooded properties and nonflooded properties, though he had nothing ″in writing″ to show\na comparison. 964 The court of appeals concluded that broad assertions of general experience were not\na sufficient predicate for the expert’s damages opinion. 965\n\nMost recently, in Houston Unlimited, the Texas Supreme Court rejected expert testimony that\ncontaminated property suffered a diminution in value that remained after the contamination subsided\ndue to the ″stigma″ of having been [*170] contaminated. 966 The Court did not reach the issue of\nwhether ″stigma″ damages could ever be recovered for a temporary injury to land because it held that\nthe expert’s testimony was legally insufficient to support the judgment even if such damages were\navailable. 967 The Court noted deficiencies in both the expert’s methodology and the predicate for her\ntheir dissimilarity to the condemned property.″); Collin Cnty. v.

Her factual predicate was defective because (1) she equated both an original listing price and\na verbal offer as establishing ″market values,″ when neither satisfies the legal definition of ″market\nvalue″; 968 (2) she relied on a ″sweetheart″ deal as establishing ″market value″ when the law requires\nan arm’s-length transaction; 969 and (3) she derived the plaintiff’s ″stigma″ damages from the ″stigma″\ndamage suffered by two other contaminated and remediated properties without ever attempting to show\nthat the diminutions in value allegedly suffered by the two other properties were attributable to\n″stigma″ rather than other market factors. 970\n\nDamages opinions cannot be based on facts or data that the applicable legal and professional standards\nbar from consideration. For example, damages opinions in oil and gas cases cannot violate the\nvalue-to-the-taker rule or the projected-enhancement rule. 971 As another example, in condemnation\ncases, business income generally cannot be considered in determining the market value of real\nproperty. 972\n\nAdditionally, when damages opinions are based on incorrect legal principles or constructions, the\nexpert’s opinion may be left without a valid predicate. For example, when an expert’s valuation of\nproperty was significantly impacted by the expert’s incorrect interpretation of the parties’ ″lockbox″\nagreement, the Eastland Court of Appeals held that ″because the foundational data underlying [the\nexpert’s] opinions is unreliable, the value [*171] opinions that he drew from that data are likewise\nunreliable, and his testimony is legally no evidence to support the jury’s verdict.″ 973 In determining\nland value, the law permits experts to predicate their value calculations on the land’s highest and best\nuse, and that may include a purpose for which the land is not currently being used. 974\n\nWhen a party seeks to recover remedial damages - often measured by the cost of repair - the party must\nestablish that the damages sought are reasonable and necessary. 975 If the cost of repair is established\nexclusively through expert testimony, then the expert must opine not only as to what repairs would\n968\n      Id. at 9 (observing that ″market value″ is what a willing buyer under no compulsion to buy will pay and a willing seller under no\ncompulsion to sell will accept, while a list price reflects only what a willing seller will accept and an unaccepted offer reflects only what\na willing buyer will pay).\n969\n      Id. at 9-10.\n970\n      Id. at 11-12.\n971\n      See, e.g., Enbridge Pipelines (E.

For example, future profit testimony that wholly fails to take into account risks\ninherent in the relevant activity is unsound - and therefore no evidence. 991 In Wyndham International,\nInc. v.

Manuel, the Fort Worth Court of Appeals held that a plaintiff’s\neconomist could rely on the defendant’s own sales forecasts as a predicate for calculating the plaintiff’s\nlost profit. 997 At trial, the defendant argued that the projections were ″not reliable″ and should not have\nbeen relied on by the economist in calculating lost profit damages. 998 The court held that the\ndefendant’s own witness had established the reliability of the projections, testifying that the document\nwas commonly used in the industry, represented the ″best number″ available, and was supported by\nextensive market research. 999 This case offers a reminder that a party challenging the predicative data\nof expert testimony may have difficulty when the expert uses that party’s own data.\n\nAnd in Rogers v. Alexander, the Dallas Court of Appeals held that an accountant’s opinion on the value\nof the company was reliable when the accountant explained why he used a particular [*175] multiplier\nto calculate the company’s value, what was common in the industry, and what factors he considered.\n1000\n\n\n\nvi. Safety Experts’ Predicates. The admissibility of testimony from ″safety″ experts is often decided\nunder other gates. For example, testimony from ″safety″ experts is not admissible if it is not helpful\nto the jury because the subject matter of the testimony is within the common knowledge and experience\nof average jurors. 1001 But opinion testimony of this nature can also be excluded based on the\ninadequacy of the expert’s predicate for forming an opinion. 1002 For example, the Fourteenth Court\nof Appeals upheld the exclusion of testimony from a workplace safety expert in a case involving an\nalleged on-the-job injury at a hospital that occurred when the employee was pushing a large food cart.\n994\n       Id. at 688.\n995\n       Id. at 689.\n996\n      Cf.

Property Owners’ Experiential Predicates. Under the property owner rule, a property owner is\nqualified to testify to the value of her property even if she would not be qualified to testify about the\nvalue of similar property belonging to someone else. 1007 The Texas Supreme Court recently held that\nwhen a property owner testifies to the value of his property, his opinion [*176] on value is functionally\nequivalent to expert testimony and thus, subject to the same reliability standards applicable to other\nexperts (though not the same qualification standards). 1008 Thus, a property owner must support her\nopinion about the value of her property with a sufficient predicate, such as ″evidence of price paid,\nnearby sales, tax valuations, appraisals, online resources, and any other relevant factors.″ 1009 Like any\nother expert, the property owner’s testimony can be based on inadmissible hearsay under appropriate\ncircumstances. 1010\n\n3. Inadmissible Predicates. 1011 Rule 703 of the Texas Rules of Evidence allows an expert to rely on\notherwise inadmissible hearsay or other evidence only if the underlying facts or data are ″of a type\nreasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.″ 1012 Thus, the text of Rule 703 requires the\nexpert to satisfy two requirements to form an opinion based on inadmissible evidence. First, the facts\nor data relied upon by the expert must be the type relied upon by experts in the field. Second, the\nexpert’s reliance must be reasonable. 1013 ″It is not sufficient for the court simply to ascertain that other\n1003\n       Moore, 140 S.W.3d at 876.\n1004\n       Id.\n1005\n       Id.\n1006\n       Id.\n1007\n       Porras v.

Not surprisingly, some decisions emphasize that courts must\ndecide independently whether the underlying information satisfies the reasonable reliance standard\nwhile others suggest that courts play a deferential role in deciding only whether experts in the field rely\non such information. 1017\n\nThe first requirement - customary reliance in the field - is insufficient by itself because, while courts\n″should give weight to the collective judgment of others in the field,″ that judgment is not\ndeterminative. 1018 Under the second requirement, the proponent of the evidence must demonstrate the\nreasonableness of such reliance in the instant case - reliance on certain types of evidence may be\nreasonable in some circumstances but not others. A court is not required to accept an expert’s assurance\nthat experts in the field reasonably rely on inadmissible information. 1019 As explained by the First\nCircuit, Rule 703 requires a trial judge to ″act as an independent ″gatekeeper’ to ensure that there is\nsufficient, credible evidence that experts do rely on the specified types of sources in formulating their\nopinions.″ 1020 An expert’s blind reliance on documents provided by a party is not reasonable. 1021 The\n\nfield and that such items are sufficiently trustworthy to make such reliance reasonable″); 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra note 187, § 7:16,\nat 856 (stating that Rule 703 requires a dual inquiry of reliance and adequacy).\n1014\n       4 Weinstein & Berger, supra note 27, § 703.04[2], at 703-10.1 to 703-11.\n1015\n        In re Paoli R.R.

Evid. 703 (″The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those\nperceived by, reviewed by, or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the\nparticular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.″). The federal\nrule is similar but not identical. See Fed. R. Evid. 703 (″An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has\nbeen made aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in\nforming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted. But if the facts or data would otherwise\nbe inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them to the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the\nopinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.″). The Advisory Committee’s notes to the federal rule draw a distinction between\nRule 702 and Rule 703:\nThere has been some confusion over the relationship between Rules 702 and 703. The amendment makes clear that the sufficiency of\nthe basis of an expert’s testimony is to be decided under Rule 702. Rule 702 sets forth the overarching requirement of reliability, and\nan analysis of the sufficiency of the expert’s basis cannot be divorced from the ultimate reliability of the expert’s opinion. In contrast,\nthe ″reasonable reliance″ requirement of Rule 703 is a relatively narrow inquiry. When an expert relies on inadmissible information, Rule\n703 requires the trial court to determine whether that information is of a type reasonably relied on by other experts in the field. If so,\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 137 of 230\n                                                      52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *179\n\nmalpractice case-within-a-case claim can determine ″the real-world settlement value″ of claims in a\nmass tort litigation. 1028 The Court held that the rule is satisfied\n\nwhen, in a mass tort litigation involving thousands of similar claimants and arising out of the same\nevent, the expert measures the ″true″ settlement value of a particular case by persuasively comparing\nall the circumstances of the case to the settlements obtained in other cases with similar circumstances\narising from the event. 1029\n\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals has also addressed Rule 703 once in a majority, published opinion in\nthe past fifteen years. In Leonard v. State, the Court held that the trial court erred in failing to exclude\nthe inadmissible and unreliable evidence relied on by the expert. 1030 The appeal arose from a trial\ncourt’s decision to revoke community supervision that was ordered after a defendant entered into a plea\nbargain. 1031 The terms of the community supervision required the defendant to successfully complete\na sex-offender treatment program and honestly [*180] complete polygraph examinations. 1032 A\npsychotherapist testified not only to the defendant’s discharge from the program, but also that the\nreason for his discharge was his failed polygraph examinations. 1033 The Court held that the trial court\nerred in admitting the psychotherapist’s testimony concerning the otherwise inadmissible evidence -\nthe failure of polygraph examinations - that formed the basis for his opinion that the defendant was\ndishonest, which in turn was the reason for his discharge from a sex-offender program. 1034 The expert\ntestified that experts in his field customarily rely on polygraph results to form opinions about a sex\noffender’s treatment. 1035\n\nThe Court stated that polygraph results are unreliable and inadmissible and ruled that this cannot be\nevaded by Rule 703. 1036 Under Rule 703, an expert can rely on inadmissible evidence only when it\nis reasonable to do so: ″The use of [the word] ″reasonably’ rather than ″customarily’ or ″regularly’\nimplies\n\nthe expert can rely on the information in reaching an opinion. However, the question whether the expert is relying on a sufficient basis\nof information - whether admissible information or not - is governed by the requirements of Rule 702.\nFed. R.

State observed that when a trial court admits otherwise\ninadmissible evidence under Rule 705(d), a great danger exists that ″the jury will consider the facts and\ndata as substantive evidence rather than as merely constituting the underlying basis for the expert’s\nopinion.″ 1079 Allowing the defendant’s mitigation expert to explain that he relied on inadmissible\nhearsay in the form of a videotaped interview of the defendant’s mother concerning his stepfather’s\nabuse created this danger. The Court also said that the expert did not need evidence of the interview\nitself for a legitimate purpose, which supported the trial court’s determination. 1080\n\nIn Resendiz v.

If these\nhearsay statements were true, the medical examiner’s opinion that the victim’s death was a homicide\nis strengthened; if they were false, it is undermined. 1115\n\nRecognizing these types of dangers, the Second Circuit carefully distinguished between allowing a\npolice officer to rely on hearsay to form an opinion and allowing the officer to regurgitate the hearsay\nto the jury. 1116 The court held that a police officer could rely on hearsay statements made by gang\nmembers during custodial and noncustodial interviews, statements made by other law enforcement\nofficers, intercepted telephone conversations, and printed and online materials because law enforcement\nofficers ″routinely and reasonably rely upon hearsay in reaching their conclusions.″ 1117 But the\nadmissibility of the opinion does not mean the expert may ″transmit hearsay to the jury.″ 1118\n\nThe court did not use the federal balancing test. Instead, the court examined whether the expert formed\nan opinion by applying his experience or a reliable methodology to the inadmissible hearsay. 1119 If the\nexpert does not apply his experience or a reliable methodology to the otherwise inadmissible data, the\nexpert is simply parroting impermissible hearsay evidence, thereby ″allowing [a party] ″to circumvent\nthe rules prohibiting hearsay.’″ 1120 The Second Circuit ruled that the district court had abused its\ndiscretion in allowing testimony from one of the government’s expert witnesses regarding gang\n1111\n       Moulton, 360 S.W.3d at 564.\n1112\n       Id. at 565.\n1113\n       Id. at 547-48.\n1114\n       Id. at 566.\n1115\n       2 Goode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 705.3, at 32 (Supp. 2014).\n1116\n       United States v.

While it may be that [the] expert opinion was formed, in part, on the basis of the published\nworks of … other researchers, scholarly literature is information reasonably relied upon by medical\nexperts.″ 1136 The court’s analysis, unfortunately, addresses only the first prong of Rule 703’s dual\nstandard - whether scholarly literature is the type of information reasonably relied on by experts, and\nignores the second prong - whether it is reasonable for the expert to rely on the literature. To answer\nthis second inquiry, the court should have examined whether reliance on the particular article was\nreasonable before it permitted the expert to buttress his own research and experience with reference to\nresearch of others. 1137 But in another case, the court [*194] used the balancing test to hold that an\nEPA report was not admissible. 1138\nc.

And you can decide as you see fit about whether to consider\nhis opinion valid or not and how much weight should be given to it.

It is faith in the skill of trial counsel, the power of the cross, and the skepticism, common\nsense, and critical faculties of judges and juries, that underlie the conclusion that the exposure of\nweakness or fatal deficiencies in expert testimony may be left to the calling party’s opponent. 1152\n\nNevertheless, this path is ″seldom taken.″ 1153 One reason is that ″Rule 705 does not exempt expert\ntestimony from the requirements of Rule 702 or permit decisions on admissibility to rest on credentials\nalone.″ 1154 Rule 705 focuses ″on the manner of presenting expert testimony to the factfinder, not on\nany obligation to clear the admissibility hurdle.″ 1155 If the expert never presents support for an\nopinion, the opinion may be stricken. 1156\n\n4. Conclusion. An expert opinion must be ″supported by an adequate foundation of relevant facts, data,\nor opinions,″ 1157 and courts must ″independently evaluate″ this predicate to ensure that it is reliable.\n1158\n      When the predicate for expert testimony is called sufficiently into question, ″the trial judge must\ndetermine whether the testimony has ″a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant\ndiscipline.’″ 1159 Ultimately, ″if the foundational data underlying opinion testimony are unreliable, an\nexpert will not be permitted to base an opinion on that data because any opinion drawn from that data\nis likewise unreliable.″ 1160 This is true even if the expert is well qualified, [*197] employs a reliable\nmethodology, and provides a well-reasoned connection between his opinion and the basis for it. In\nother words, like a math problem, an expert can employ the right formula and correctly perform the\nmath, but he will not get the right answer if he plugs the wrong numbers into the formula.

Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in\nDaubert 1165 and the Texas Supreme Court’s opinions in Robinson 1166 and Havner, 1167 when an\nexpert’s methodology is not reliable, the resulting opinion and testimony is not ″knowledge″ and is\ninadmissible. 1168 Daubert refers to this reliability test as the [*198] ″evidentiary reliability″ test. 1169\nBecause this gate focuses primarily on the reliability of the expert’s methodology, we call this gate the\nmethodological reliability gate. 1170 This gate examines whether ″the testimony is the product of\nreliable principles and methods.″ 1171\n\n1. Overview of Pre-2000 Cases. In Daubert, the Supreme Court rejected Frye 1172 as well as ″the\nlet-it-all-in standard in favor of a new reliability standard.″ 1173 The Court made four ″general\nobservations″ of factors to be examined under that reliability standard: 1174\n\n1161\n       See, e.g., Hous.

These two questions usually will lead to the same result. That which has a strong scientific\nfoundation usually will be generally accepted; that which has a weak scientific foundation usually will not be widely accepted. In those\nsituations, both standards will admit or both will exclude. But sometimes the two will diverge. When asserted knowledge is sound but\nnot generally accepted, Daubert permits its admission while Frye does not… . When asserted knowledge has not been shown to be sound,\nbut nevertheless has gained general acceptance in the field, then Daubert excludes even though Frye would admit… . Put most simply,\nDaubert sets a higher threshold for admissibility in some circumstances and a lower threshold under other circumstances.\n1 Faigman et al., supra note 246, § 1:15, at 49-51.\n1173\n       Bernstein, supra note 246, at 41.\n1174\n       Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94.\n1175\n       Id.\n1176\n       Id.\n1177\n       Id. at 594.\n1178\n       Id. at 594 (citations omitted).\n1179\n       Id. at 593.\n1180\n       Imwinkelried, supra note 881, at 962.\n1181\n       Id. at 974.\n1182\n       Id. at 962-63.\n1183\n        Id. (quoting Daubert II, 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995)). In Daubert, the Court focused on whether the expert opinion reflected\n″scientific knowledge″ and examined expert opinions ″derived by the scientific method″ and whether their work product amounted to\n″good science.″ Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593. For example, the testing factor was specifically tied to scientific knowledge: courts must\ndetermine ″whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact [by determining] whether it can be (and\nhas been) tested.″ Id. at 593. Rate of error applies in examining ″a particular scientific technique.″ Id. at 594. General acceptance\nexamined acceptance within the ″relevant scientific community.″ Id. Daubert II explained that Daubert instructs courts ″to determine\nwhether the analysis undergirding the experts’ testimony falls within the range of accepted standards governing how scientists conduct\ntheir research and reach their conclusions.″ Daubert II, 43 F.3d at 1317.\n\f                                                                                                                         Page 153 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *199\n\nDespite its identification of these factors, the Supreme Court stressed that the inquiry envisioned by\nRule 702 is a ″flexible″ one. 1184 On remand, the Ninth Circuit added another factor for assessing\nreliability: whether the technique was derived through independent research or was developed for\nlitigation purposes. 1185 The Ninth Circuit noted the expert’s bald assurances that the opinions are\nbased on sound scientific techniques was insufficient; the expert had to offer some objective,\nindependent validation of that methodology. 1186\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court followed the lead of Daubert and adopted a reliability test for scientific\nexpert testimony in E.I. du [*200] Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson. 1187 A horticulturalist testified\nthat a fungicide was contaminated with an herbicide and that the application of the contaminated\nfungicide damaged the Robinsons’ pecan trees. 1188 The methodology he used to reach this opinion\nincluded visual inspections and ″comparative symptomology.″ 1189 He did not conduct any soil or\ntissue testing or test the fungicide. 1190\n\nThe Court announced a general rule that expert testimony must be ″based upon a reliable foundation.″\n1191\n     Trial judges act as gatekeepers who have a ″heightened responsibility to ensure that expert\ntestimony shows some indicia of reliability.″ 1192 For evidence involving scientific techniques or\nprinciples, the evidence must be ″grounded ″in the methods and procedures of science.’″ 1193 The\nCourt adopted six factors that a trial court ″may consider″ for determining reliability under Rule 702\nbut stressed that the factors are both flexible and nonexhaustive. 1194 These factors include all four of\nthose identified in Daubert, the additional factor identified by the Ninth Circuit upon remand in\nDaubert II, and the extent to which the technique relies upon the subjective interpretation of the expert\n\n1184\n       Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594.\n1185\n       See Daubert II, 43 F.3d at 1317. The court explained:\nThat an expert testifies for money does not necessarily cast doubt on the reliability of his testimony, as few experts appear in court merely\nas an eleemosynary gesture. But in determining whether proposed expert testimony amounts to good science, we may not ignore the fact\nthat a scientist’s normal workplace is the lab or the field, not the courtroom or the lawyer’s office.\n\nId.\n1186\n       Id. at 1316.\n1187\n       E.I. du Point de Nemours & Co. v.

Rev. 1, *200\n\n(which we will refer to as the Daubert or Robinson factors). 1195 The Court added one absolute\nrequirement for reliability: an expert testifying on causation must take reasonable steps to exclude\nother plausible causes of the damages in question, a process best described as differential etiology. 1196\n\n [*201] Following Daubert, the Texas Supreme Court also stated that the inquiry focuses ″solely on\nthe underlying principles and methodology, not on the conclusions they generate.″ 1197 The difficulty\nwith this ″methodology only″ limitation is that Daubert also charged trial courts with assessing\n″whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and … whether\nthat reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.″ 1198 To examine the\nexpert’s reasoning or application of a methodology necessarily requires a court to review the expert’s\nconclusion. Moreover, ″it is not always a straightforward exercise to disaggregate method and\nconclusion.″ 1199 The U.S. Supreme Court in Joiner later clarified its statement, declaring that\n″conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from one another″ and that nothing in ″Daubert\nor the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected\nto existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.″ 1200 The Texas Supreme Court followed suit in\nGammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc. 1201\n\nApplying these factors in Robinson, the Texas Supreme Court held that the expert’s ″methodology″\nwas unreliable. 1202 For example, his comparative symptomology method failed four of these factors:\nit (1) had not been subjected to peer review or [*202] publication; (2) had no known rate of error; (3)\n\n\n\n1195\n       Id.; see Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94; Daubert II, 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995).\n1196\n       Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 558-59. The Texas Supreme Court has noted on several occasions that expert testimony on causation\nmust eliminate other potential causes. Brown, supra note 1, at 799-800; see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 313 S.W.3d 837, 840\n(Tex. 2010) (holding that expert’s failure to explain how he eliminated potential cause of fire made it conclusory and unreliable); In re\nAllied Chem.

Therefore, the ″methodology only″ limitation applies only to the\nmethodological reliability gate, not the predicative and connective reliability gates. Because this limitation applies to one of the three\nreliability gates, broad statements relying on this limitation should be avoided. See, e.g., United States v. Stafford, 721 F.3d 380, 393-94\n(6th Cir. 2013) (classifying an admissibility challenge to an expert’s conclusion as a challenge to reliability, not the expert’s qualifications\nor the opinion’s relevance); McDowell v.

Carmichael. 1208\nThe Gammill Court stated that the text of Rule 702 does not adopt ″dual standards″ for the\nadmissibility of expert testimony. 1209 The Court further explained that ″it would be an odd rule of\nevidence that insisted that some expert opinions be reliable but not others.″ 1210 Even if an expert’s\ntestimony is based upon skill and experience, the expert opinion testimony still must demonstrate\nreliability, including that it is the product of a ″scientifically valid″ methodology. 1211 ″Acknowledging\nthat [*203] square pegs do not fit round holes,″ 1212 both Courts stated that some of the Daubert factors\nmight not apply to nonscientific testimony. 1213 They apply only when ″they are reasonable measures\nof the reliability of expert testimony.″ 1214 The Kumho Court explained that their applicability depends\n\n\n\n\n1203\n        Id. The Court stated that the opinions were formed for purposes of litigation.

Subsequent Development of Factors for Assessing Methodological Reliability. Trial courts are\ngranted a great deal of deference in selecting and applying the factors to determine the reliability of\nan expert’s methodology 1217 because the listed factors may not be relevant, and therefore, are not\nmandatory. 1218 Indeed, one Texas court of appeals stated, ″In non-scientific cases, it is impossible to\nset out specific criteria for evaluating the reliability of expert testimony, and, ultimately, the trial court\nhas discretion to determine how to assess reliability.″ 1219 Joiner [*204] emphasizes the trial court’s\ndiscretion in applying the Daubert factors. 1220 Kumho confers a deeper type of discretion on the trial\njudge - in the case of nonscientific expertise, discretion to select the factors to apply. 1221\n\n\n\n\n1215\n       Id. at 150. The Court further explained that the Daubert factors ″may or may not be pertinent in assessing reliability, depending\non the nature of the issue, the expert’s particular expertise, and the subject of his testimony.″ Id.\n1216\n       Id. at 152.\n1217\n        Gen.

If testing of critical aspects of an\nexpert’s testimony has not taken place … then an explanation of why it has not is an important\nconsideration in evaluating the expert opinions [*210] and determining whether they were\nsubstantively more than merely the expert’s conclusory, subjective opinion. 1260\nThe plaintiffs claimed that Whirlpool’s use of a corrugated tube in a dryer’s air-circulation system was\na design defect that allowed the tube to become clogged and caused lint to be discharged into the dryer\nwhere it was ignited by the heater element, which caused the clothes to catch on fire and spread to the\nrest of the house. 1261 The Whirlpool Court applied the Daubert factors to question the methodological\nreliability of the engineer’s opinion, observing that the engineer’s theory was developed for the\nlawsuit, had not been published or subjected to peer review, and had not been accepted as a valid theory\nby any part of a relevant scientific or expert community at large. 1262 The expert\nhad not seen or read of a test showing that a corrugated lint transport tube in a dryer properly vented\nsuch as the Camachos’ was, would become clogged with lint to the extent it backed lint up into the\nblower assembly. He did not personally test his theory. Nor did he test his theory that the lint would\nbe blown through the lint chute seal if the lint transport tube became clogged. 1263\nIn contrast, Whirlpool presented expert testimony supported by test results showing that any particles\nof lint that could pass through the dryer’s inlet grill would be much smaller than those in a report relied\n1257\n       Sappington v.

Whirlpool thus offers a valuable example of how predicative, methodological, and connective\nreliability can interact and overlap in the context of a reliability review. See id. It is also worth noting that, while Whirlpool involved\na legal-sufficiency review, the defendant had properly preserved objections to the admissibility of the plaintiffs’ expert evidence. Thus,\na review of the expert’s methodology was not inconsistent with the Court’s previous holdings that ″when a reliability challenge requires\nthe court to evaluate the underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made\nso that the trial court has the opportunity to conduct this analysis.″ City of San Antonio v.

Interestingly, the Court also stated that the trial court had discretion to determine the\nreliability of the expert’s opinion by applying five of the six Robinson factors without relying on the\nGammill analytical gap test. 1270 Because the Gammill analysis formed the basis for the court of\nappeals’ holding, the Court did not focus on these factors except to make it clear that both the Gammill\nand Daubert tests applied. 1271\n\nIn contrast, the Houston First Court of Appeals focused largely on the other Daubert factors in holding\nthat a professional fire investigator’s origin-of-fire opinion was sufficiently reliable, despite the\nabsence of testing, in part because fire investigation ″does not lend itself to testing.″ 1272 The [*212]\ncourt stated that the expert’s ″opinion fits the facts of the case and there [were] no significant analytical\ngaps in his testimony″ and was based on physical evidence, collected samples, burn patterns, damage\n1264\n       Id. at 640-41.\n1265\n        While the Court phrased the issue as whether Whirlpool conclusively disproved Camacho’s theory, it is probably better to describe\nthe issue as whether Whirlpool disproved it as a matter of law. Daubert recognizes the inherent uncertainty of the scientific enterprise.\nWhen an expert relies on inductive reasoning to investigate hypotheses about phenomena, the expert does not regard a proposition as\nconclusively validated because there is always another conceivable empirical test. As long as an expert can conceive of another empirical\ntest, there is an unavoidable possibility of subsequent falsification of the hypothesis. See John Ziman, Reliable Knowledge: An\nExploration of the Grounds for Belief in Science 2 (1978) (″We have cast off the naive doctrine that all science is necessarily true and\nthat all true knowledge is necessarily scientific.″ (emphasis omitted)); Imwinkelried, supra note 877, at 746 (″Since there is always the\npossibility of invalidation in a subsequent test, induction can yield only probability.″); Edward J.

L. Rev. 1, *216\n\n [*216] With respect to the lack of physical testing of an engineer’s causation theory, the Seventh\nCircuit stated that while ″testing is certainly one of the most common and useful reliability guideposts\nfor a district court when contemplating proposed Rule 702 evidence … physical re-creations of\nindustrial accidents are not always feasible or prudent.″ 1299 The court went on to state that the\ndefendant’s complaint about the lack of physical testing\n\noverlooks the fact that simulation is one of the most common of scientific and engineering tools.\nAround the world, computers simulate nuclear explosions, quantum mechanical interactions,\natmospheric weather patterns, and innumerable other systems that are difficult or impossible to observe\ndirectly. A mathematical or computer model is a perfectly acceptable form of test. 1300\n\nThe defendant also criticized the engineer’s calculations, asserting that they were ″opaque″ and\ninsufficiently detailed. 1301 The Seventh Circuit again disagreed, noting that the engineer’s calculations\nto support his opinion were attached to his report and made available to the defendant and the court.\n1302\n     If the defendant wanted to explore the underlying facts and data, the court observed that the\ndefendant could have done so in cross-examination. 1303 The court went on to say this:\n\nLawyers and judges who were not trained in science can benefit from the famous ″Two Cultures″\nlecture given in 1959 by British scientist and novelist C.P. Snow, in which he described the cultural\ngap between persons schooled in the sciences and those schooled in the humanities:\n\nA good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional\nculture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their\nincredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the\ncompany how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was\ncold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have\nyou read a work of Shakespeare’s?\n [*217]\n\n….\n\n… If [the engineer’s notes] appear opaque to some readers, it is more likely because of the ″Two\nCultures″ problem rather than any inadequacy of presentation. As with most informal work-product,\nthe notes could have been even clearer and more self-explanatory, but [the defendant’s] lawyers and\nthe district judge all had opportunities to ask [the engineer] to explain his calculations. Based on the\nwritten submissions, the district judge here did not feel the need to question [the engineer] directly, and\n[the defendant] did not request that he hold a hearing to do so. 1304\n1299\n       Id. at 815.\n1300\n       Id. at 810.\n1301\n       Id.\n1302\n       Id. at 810-11.\n1303\n       Id. at 811.\n1304\n       Id.

L. Rev. 1, *217\n\nWhen an expert opinion is supported by testing or studies, it may still be subject to an expert challenge\nbecause all tests are not ″equally valuable. Research methods vary considerably, and some tests amount\nto no test at all.″ 1305\n\nAdditionally, an opposing party’s criticisms of the reliability of the testing or studies is sometimes\nviewed as a matter for cross-examination rather than admissibility. In Taber v. Roush, a Texas court of\nappeals held that criticism of the expert’s reliance on retrospective (rather than prospective) studies\nwas ″properly addressed by cross examination rather than exclusion″ because even though retrospective\nstudies are generally ″considered to be less reliable than prospective studies,″ there was a reasonable\nexplanation for the dearth of prospective studies on the subject. 1306 The Texas Supreme Court said in\nGammill,\n\nThe trial court’s gatekeeping function under Rule 702 does not supplant cross-examination as ″the\ntraditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.″ But neither does the\navailability of cross-examination relieve the trial court of its threshold responsibility under Rule 702\n″of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task\nat hand.″ 1307\n\nThe issue of whether testing - or the other Daubert factors - applied to an expert opinion on the\nsequence of an accident was [*218] addressed by the Texas Supreme Court in Ramirez. 1308 The Court\nfirst observed that the Daubert factors ″cannot be used with certain kinds of expert testimony″ and that\nsometimes an expert’s ″experience alone may provide a sufficient basis for″ an opinion. 1309 ″That,\nhowever, is not the circumstance in this case.″ 1310 The accident reconstructionist’s theory was that the\nleft rear wheel of the plaintiff’s vehicle could, and did, remain pocketed in its wheel well as the vehicle\nveered across the median, until its impact with another vehicle. 1311 According to the expert’s ″floating\nwheel theory,″ the wheel assembly broke before - not after - a collision with a motorist. 1312 The\nexpert’s theory flunked the first two Daubert tests: He did not conduct or cite any tests to support his\ntheory and did not identify any supporting publications for his theory. 1313 Nor did he explain how the\n\n\n\n\n1305\n       1 Faigman et al., supra note 246, § 1:17, at 55.\n1306\n       Taber v.

But while there is no absolute requirement of testing, this\nstatement could be read to make general acceptance the proxy for the methodological reliability\ninquiry, a proposition rejected in Daubert. 1318 That does not mean general acceptance is not\ncircumstantial evidence of the methodological soundness of the underlying theory. If a theory has\ngained widespread acceptance, presumably other experts have had a chance to review it, and the lack\nof any substantive criticism indicates the study was reliable. Nevertheless, it might be more accurate\nto qualify this statement by explaining that testing is not necessary if other evidence of reliability is\nsufficient or if the court may take judicial notice of reliability. 1319 If a methodology is well established,\nit may not be difficult to show that the methodology is reliable based on literature or nonjudicial uses.\n1320\n\n\n\nThe testing requirement can, nonetheless, be read too stringently. The testing to support the reliability\nof a methodology does not have to be the expert’s own testing; the expert may rely on testing by others.\n1321\n     The mere fact that an expert has never previously performed a test does not make the test results\n\n1314\n       Id. at 905-06.\n1315\n        See discussion of Ramirez in Part III.D (connective reliability) at infra notes 1616-33 and accompanying text. In additional to\nGammill, the Court in two other cases involving vehicular accidents did not examine the Daubert factors but instead applied the Gammill\nanalytical gap test. See TXI Transp. Co. v. Hughes, 306 S.W.3d 230, 239-40 (Tex. 2010); Ford Motor Co. v. Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d 32,\n40 (Tex. 2007).

A testable theory attains the status of\nscientific knowledge only when it has successfully survived the crucible of testing. 1330\n\nUltimately, the primary requirement under this factor is that ″someone else using the same data and\nmethods … be able to replicate the results.″ 1331 ″One of the great strengths of the scientific method\nis that it permits other scientists to later attempt to duplicate the earlier test to see whether they can\nreplicate the test result.″ 1332\nb. Peer Review and Publication. The second Daubert factor is whether the expert’s theory has been\nsubject to publication and peer review. Peer review and publication ″reveal[] whether an expert has\nsubmitted the expert’s methodology and conclusions to a group of peers who can then independently\nand substantively evaluate the expert’s methodology and conclusions.″ 1333 Publication results in\n″exposure to peer review″ and ″serves as independent indicia of the reliability of the [expert’s theory].″\n1334\n     ″Submission to the scrutiny of the scientific community is a component of ″good science,’ in part\nbecause it increases the likelihood that substantive flaws in methodology will be detected.″ 1335 ″By\nthe same token, publication and peer review also demonstrate a measure of acceptance of the [expert’s]\nmethodology within the [relevant] community.″ 1336\nThis test has numerous applications; it is sometimes applied to the expert’s predicate (e.g., has the\nclinical study on which the expert relies been published in medical journals and subjected to peer\nreview), the expert’s methodology (e.g., has the expert’s approach to projecting profitability been\npublished [*222] in economic texts and subjected to peer review), and the expert’s conclusion (e.g.,\ndid the expert conclude that the chemical used by the defendant causes the disease suffered by the\nplaintiff in an article he published and subjected to peer review).\n\nCourts sometimes refer to this factor as ″publication in peer-reviewed literature.″ 1337 But courts do not\nlimit their reliability inquiry to literature that goes through a formal prepublication peer-review\nprocess. For example, textbooks or treatises are examined by courts. 1338 The existence of literature\noutside the context of litigation addresses the bias concerns that underlie Daubert and its progeny.\n1330\n       2 Goode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 702.6, at 57 (footnotes omitted).

But even when an expert’s publication is not\nsubject to prepublication peer-review, it is still subject to postpublication peer review. 1339\n\nOne federal court stated that whether an expert’s theory has been subjected to peer-reviewed\npublication is one of the two primary criteria for establishing the reliability of scientific expert\ntestimony. 1340 The Ninth Circuit stated in Daubert II that when scientific experts cannot cite any\nsupporting peer-reviewed publication,\n\nthe experts must explain precisely how they went about reaching their conclusions and point to some\nobjective source - a learned treatise, the policy statement of a professional association, a published\narticle in a reputable scientific journal or the like - to show that they have followed the scientific\nevidence method, as it is practiced by (at least) a recognized minority of scientists in their field. 1341\n\n [*223] Similarly, the Houston Fourteenth Court of Appeals stated that courts must ″be especially\n                                                                                                                           1342\nskeptical of scientific evidence that has not been published or subjected to peer review.″\n\nNevertheless, lack of publication ″will rarely, if ever, be the single dispositive factor that determines\nthe reliability of expert testimony.″ 1343 If publication in peer-reviewed literature alone was sufficient\nto demonstrate reliability, ″then the Frye standard of general acceptability in the scientific community\nwould have remained adequate.″ 1344 The opposite is also true: to require publication for all expert\ntestimony ″would effectively resurrect a Frye-like bright-line standard, not by requiring that a\nmethodology be ″generally accepted,’ but by excluding expert testimony not backed by published (and\npresumably peer-reviewed) studies.″ 1345 Thus, while it is an important factor, 1346 it is only a factor.\nThat is largely because publication and peer review ″are mere proxies for the determinative factor″ of\nand that such an ″estimate may be made by the expert putting the principles to work″); Ruiz-Troche, 161 F.3d at 84 (noting expert relied\non ″standard medical textbook″); Marvelli v.

In Kudabeck v.

Suppose, for example, that a prosecutor wants to offer testimony that a\ndrug dog’s alert indicated that there had been contraband drugs in a piece of luggage. A judge might\nask: How often have you seen Rex alert? In what percentage of those cases was there a follow-up\nsearch? And what percentage of those searches yielded the discovery of contraband drugs? 1379 In\nDaubert, the Court cites John Ziman’s book, Reliable Knowledge. 1380 Ziman’s point is that in order\nto determine the validity of a technique, an empiricist should often insist on proof of the results of the\nuse of the technique. 1381\n\n\n\n\n1375\n       E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v.

General acceptance was the exclusive test under the old Frye standard for\nadmissibility of opinion testimony. 1382 Daubert maintained this as one, but only [*229] one, of the\nfactors to be considered in determining the reliability of opinion evidence. 1383\n\nA ″reliability assessment does not require, although it does permit, explicit identification of a relevant\nscientific community and an express determination of a particular degree of acceptance within that\ncommunity.″ … Widespread acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular evidence\nadmissible, and ″a known technique which has been able to attract only minimal support within the\ncommunity″ … may properly be viewed with skepticism. 1384\n\n″That an expert’s technique can only garner minimal support may suggest that the expert is not\nimpartial.″ 1385 ″A determination of reliability cannot rest solely on a process of ″counting (scientific)\nnoses[,]’″ 1386 but the absence of general acceptance is an indicator of a lack of reliability. 1387 An\nexpert’s ″bald assurance″ that he used a widely accepted methodology is not sufficient to demonstrate\nreliability. 1388 Courts must look beyond an expert’s conclusory assertions about the Daubert factors.\n1389\n     ″To establish reliability under Daubert, an expert bears the burden of furnishing ″some objective,\nindependent validation of [his] methodology.’″ 1390\n\n [*230] When this factor is satisfied, it is a strong indication that the opinion is sufficiently reliable,\nbut how strong depends on the circumstances. Two concerns that were present under the old Frye test\nremain under this factor: first, how broadly or narrowly should a court define the ″relevant scientific\n1382\n        Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923). Professor Imwinkelried observes that when used as the sole criteria for measuring\nthe reliability of expert testimony, this test functions as a ″failed, crude proxy″ or ″surrogate″ for whether the expert can reliably draw\na proposed opinion. Imwinkelried, supra note 881, at 965-66. Indeed, ″it amounted to a formal delegation of the admissibility decision\nto that community.″ Id. at 965.

Subjectiveness. The next Daubert factor - the extent to which the expert’s technique relies upon the\nsubjective interpretation of the expert 1394 - ″examines methodology, but it [*231] also points out the\npotential for error in the substantive conclusion because no guidelines exist to determine the validity\nof the conclusion.″ 1395 This test somewhat overlaps with the testing and publication factors because\nwhen an expert’s methodology has not been shown to be reliable by testing or peer review, it will often\nfail this test. 1396 The test is closely related to the overarching limitation on expert testimony that it\nmust be more than ″subjective belief or unsupported speculation.″ 1397\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court relied on this factor when it concluded that an accident reconstructionist’s\nopinion was unreliable in part because it was based solely upon the expert’s ″subjective interpretation\nof the facts.″ 1398 Other courts have excluded opinions when they were ″transparently subjective″ 1399\nand ″highly subjective.″ 1400\n1391\n        See Simon A. Cole, Out of the Daubert Fire and into the Fryeing Pan? Self-Validation, Meta-Expertise and the Admissibility of\nLatent Print Evidence in Frye Jurisdictions, 9 Minn. J.L.

The first question has played a particularly important role in criminal cases. Compare, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Orians, 9 F. Supp. 2d 1168, 1173 (D. Ariz. 1998) (″The acceptance in the scientific community depends in large part\non how the relevant scientific community is defined. Defendants urge the court to consider only the portion of the scientific community\nthat is well-versed in polygraph methodology and science. However, the court is reluctant to embrace such a narrow interpretation.″),\nwith United States v. Smith, 869 F.2d 348, 352 (7th Cir. 1989) (″Smith’s principal argument is that spectrographic voice identification\nhas not received sufficient general acceptance in the scientific community to be admissible under Frye. She contends that in cases where\ncourts have admitted voice identification testimony, these courts have too narrowly defined the relevant scientific community to include\nonly those scientists who use the technique, and not those who oppose its use. The relevant scientific community includes not only those\nwho utilize spectrographic voice identification techniques, but linguists, psychologists and engineers as well.″ (footnotes omitted)).\n1393\n       2 Goode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 702.6, at 59.

Whether an expert’s theory has nonlitigation uses, the final Daubert factor ″does\nnot focus on the expert’s methodology, but on the impartiality or neutrality of the expert.″ 1401 It\nexamines whether ″outside of the world of litigation,″ the expert or the industry have recognized the\nmethodology. 1402 It has been described as the ″flowing-naturally-from-independent-research factor.″\n1403\n     This [*232] ″important factor … may be a valuable indicator of reliability for several reasons.\nFirst, an expert whose findings flow from existing research or other work in a field is less likely to be\nbiased toward a particular conclusion by a fee.″ 1404\nSecond, research or other work that is conducted in the ordinary course of an expert’s business is more\nlikely to satisfy the standards normally applied to experts in the field. Third, the limited number of\nexperts who are actively working in a particular field constrains a party’s ability to shop for an expert\nwho will reach the desired conclusion. 1405\nOne federal court described this factor as one of the two primary criteria for establishing the reliability\nof scientific expert testimony. 1406\nFailure to satisfy this factor ″will not render an expert’s opinion unreliable per se, [but] ″opinions\nformed solely for the purpose of testifying are more likely to be biased toward a particular result.’″ 1407\nThis factor will have limited application in the case of some forensic sciences, where the techniques\ndo not have any nonjudicial applications.\n\ng. Exclusion of Other Plausible Causes. As previously discussed, 1408 one Robinson factor is an\nabsolute requirement in causation opinions: the expert must take reasonable steps to eliminate - or at\nsubjective guesswork must be excluded (quoting S.V. v.

The Dallas, El Paso, and Fort Worth Courts of Appeals have\nall listed this factor as one of four reliability tests in cases involving differential etiology testimony. 1409\nOf course, it is not an absolute requirement for all [*233] expert opinions because all opinions do not\naddress causation, but it is a requirement in Texas for expert causation opinions. 1410 The Advisory\nCommittee’s notes for the Federal Rules also include this factor. 1411 It is a valid epistemological\ntechnique, provided it is reliably applied. Diagnostic tests, for example, can often be used to eliminate\nother plausible causes.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly identified ″reasonable certainty″ as the standard for an\nexpert’s elimination of other plausible causes, when it is possible to do so. 1412 The Ninth Circuit has\ncautioned that this requirement must be balanced against ″the difficulties in establishing certainty in\nthe medical sciences.″ 1413 A Texas court of appeals expanded this principle in stating that ″an expert\nshould address evidence that contradicts his conclusions.″ 1414 However, it also said that an expert ″is\nnot required … [to] categorically exclude each and every possible alternative cause in order to render\nthe proffered testimony admissible.″ 1415 The court further stated that ″there is room for discussion\nregarding the degree to which admissibility and sufficiency determinations depend on exclusion of\nproffered or alternative explanations for a particular event.″ 1416 The Texas Supreme Court stated in\na recent case that it does not require [*234] the exclusion of ″the universe of all other possible causes.″\n1417\n     The Court has also indicated that, in some scenarios, the universe of possible causes ″is simply too\n\n\n1409\n        State Farm Lloyds v.

A methodology that is designed to confirm a\npreconceived conclusion is the antithesis of the scientific method and unreliable by definition.″ 1422\nThus, an expert cannot reach an opinion and then search for supporting data. 1423\n\nCourts have relied on a number of other factors for excluding expert opinions. For example, the\nexpert’s methodology will not be reliable when the expert fails ″to apply his own methodology [*235]\nreliably.″ 1424 Rejection of an expert’s theory by a peer-reviewed journal also supports a finding of lack\nof reliability. 1425 When an expert uses a methodology that he has never used before the litigation in\nquestion, that factor may suggest a lack of reliability. 1426 ″Talking off the cuff - deploying neither data\nnor analysis - is not an acceptable methodology.″ 1427 Similarly, common sense is not a reliable\n\n1418\n       Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v.

For example, an expert’s methodology is not necessarily\nunreliable simply because an opposing expert uses a different methodology. 1439 Under this [*237]\nprinciple, when opposing parties present physician experts with different theories of how a plaintiff’s\ninjury came about, if both theories are based on different but reliable methodologies, it is for the jury\nto decide which physician is most likely correct. 1440 In New Hampshire Insurance Co. v. Allison, both\nsides’ physicians agreed that the plaintiff died as a result of a rupture at the site of a plaque buildup\nin the plaintiff’s artery, which became blocked and caused a heart attack. 1441 The experts also agreed\nthat increased physical activity can increase the risk of heart attack. 1442 But they disagreed over\nwhether the plaintiff’s heart attack was caused by the plaintiff’s physical activity during his employer’s\n″fire training school.″ 1443 The defendant’s expert testified that the increased risk of heart attack after\nincreased physical activity only lasted for forty-five minutes, at which time the risk returned to\nbaseline. 1444 Because the plaintiff’s heart attack occurred more than forty-five minutes after his\nincreased activity during fire training, the expert concluded that the fire training had no correlation\nwith the heart attack. 1445 The plaintiff’s expert, on the other hand, opined that the plaintiff’s activity\nduring fire training caused his heart attack because, from a cardiac perspective, the plaintiff had been\nstable and asymptomatic up until the time of the training; he testified that there was a continuity of\nsymptoms from the time the fire training ended until the plaintiff had his heart attack. 1446 The\ndefendant argued that the plaintiff’s expert testimony was unreliable because it was contrary to the\n1437\n       Id.\n1438\n        Dix et al., supra note 1379, § 13, at 37 (stating that another test is ″whether there is a feedback loop, alerting a member of the\nprofession when she has erred.

L. Rev. 1, *239\n\nExpert testimony on legal matters offers a good example of when the Daubert factors may have limited\napplication. 1458 Such testimony ordinarily must be strictly limited because it is the job of the trial\njudge, not an expert, to determine what the law is and to instruct the jury accordingly. 1459 This presents\nsome unique problems.\n\n [*240] First, expert testimony on the law is an area of expertise where two generally applicable\nprinciples of judicial reliability review converge. The first general principle is that courts evaluate the\nreliability of an expert’s opinion by ″focusing solely on the underlying principles and methodology,″\nnot the correctness of the expert’s conclusions. 1460 The second general principle is that expert\ntestimony that is premised on an incorrect understanding of the law or on a legally incorrect theory is\nincompetent. 1461 Because of the overlap of these two principles, legal expert testimony is a rare\nspecimen in which courts must evaluate both the validity of the expert’s methodology and the\nsoundness of the expert’s legal conclusions. In evaluating the correctness of the expert’s legal\nconclusions, two Daubert factors may be helpful: whether the expert’s statement about the applicable\nlegal principle is reflected in publications and whether the expert has made statements about the legal\nprinciple in question in a nonjudicial setting. But those questions are asked for a different purpose than\nin a Daubert methodological inquiry; they are asked to determine the correctness of the expert’s\nstatement of law rather than the validity of the expert’s underlying methodology.\n1458\n       Legal expert testimony is frequently offered in two contexts: opinions relating to the reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s\nfees and opinions relating to the standard of care and causation in legal malpractice actions. Opinions about attorney’s fees are typically\nbased on the attorney’s experience and knowledge of the relevant legal market, and are discussed in the predicative-reliability section\nabove. See supra notes 895-920 and accompanying text. Judicial review of causation opinions in legal malpractice cases often focuses\non whether the legal expert provided an adequate and logically valid explanation of how and why the alleged breach of care caused the\nclaimant’s injury, as discussed in the connective-reliability section below.

Rev. 1, *240\n\nSecond, under the procedures commonly used in jury trials, the legal expert ″must testify before the\njury has received the jury charge and before it has been instructed on specific elements and standards\nconcerning specific claims. The lawyers, the expert, and the judge begin trial with knowledge of the\ngenerally applicable duties and their potential scope; the jurors do not.″ 1462 Thus, trial courts\nsometimes permit expert testimony on legal matters that provide needed context or background. There\nare two potential solutions to the problem of experts testifying on the law. First, in order to apply legal\nconcepts to the issues in the case, the expert may be given ″″some leeway’ to reference the controlling\n″legal terms’ and related concepts while testifying. Otherwise, a jury would not be able to make sense\nof the expert’s testimony or measure it against the charge’s requirements, and the sponsoring litigant\ncould not meet a motion for directed verdict.″ 1463 Under this procedure,\n [*241]\n\nthe standards governing admission of expert testimony do not automatically foreclose every reference\nto legal terms … . Such an expert properly may include these references when the trial court sets\nappropriate limits. The continuum of potentially relevant testimony from an expert likely will vary\naccording to the specific facts and the specific legal standards being litigated in specific cases. 1464\n                                                                                                                                        1465\nThus, the expert must be given some latitude but cannot ″testify without any limits whatsoever.″\nThe limits in that case are to ensure that the expert correctly identifies the legal principles.\nThere is another, and in the view of the Authors, better solution in many cases: give the portion of the\njury charge on the applicable legal principle immediately before the expert’s testimony and then limit\nthe expert to applying that law or explaining its rationale. This procedure has been successfully used\nin at least one jury trial. 1466 It is somewhat analogous to the trial court’s determination of the scope\nof patent claims ″as a matter of law″ after a Markman hearing. 1467 Admittedly, it requires more pretrial\nwork by the trial judge - although not a great deal more if the court ensures that the expert’s opinion\non the law is correct before admitting it. The larger problem is that evidence evolves during trials and\ntherefore the legal principles implicated by the evidence may likewise evolve as a trial progresses. But\nthis same weakness applies to expert testimony generally: if the evidence evolves in an unanticipated\nway after the expert testifies, the expert may need to be recalled as a witness. Another difficulty is that\n1462\n       Fleming, 395 S.W.3d at 928.\n1463\n       Id. at 928-29.\n1464\n       Id. at 929 (citation omitted).\n1465\n       Id.

As discussed above, an expert’s experiences sometimes provide\npredicative data for her opinion. 1468 In that instance, the expert must demonstrate that her experience,\ntogether with any other predicate for the opinion, offers a sound and probative basis for opinion. 1469\nWhen an expert’s experience forms part of the predicate for her opinion, courts sometimes speak of\nexperience as a means of assessing methodological reliability in addition to - or on rare occasion, in\nsubstitution for - the Daubert factors. 1470 We suggest that the applicability of the Daubert factors is\ngoverned by the same test regardless of whether the expert’s opinion is predicated in whole or in part\non the expert’s training and experience: ″[A] trial court should consider the [Daubert] factors … when\ndoing so will be helpful in determining reliability of an expert’s testimony, regardless of whether the\ntestimony is scientific in nature or experience-based.″ 1471\nExperience can be subject to some of the Daubert factors - for example, if the expert ever tested her\nexperience, published her experience, or had any experience on this issue outside litigation. 1472 The\nDaubert factors ″may or may not be pertinent in assessing reliability, depending on the nature of the\nissue, the expert’s particular expertise, and the subject of his [*243] testimony.″ 1473 In other\nsituations, however, the Daubert factors will not be helpful. 1474 In most situations, the focus of an\ninquiry into the expert’s experiences is best viewed not as a Daubert factor for reviewing reliability but\nas predicate data, the sufficiency of which must be analyzed by its quantity and similarity to the\nquestion at issue and perhaps its temporal proximity to the events in question.\n1468\n       See supra Part III.B.2.c.i.\n1469\n       See supra Part III.B.2.c.i.\n1470\n       See Whirlpool Corp. v.

Crump, the plaintiff’s physician expert relied on his\n″experience and training as a transplant specialist and surgeon, his dealings with infection-susceptible\nimmunosuppressed patients, and his direct dealings with [the plaintiff] - which included taking cultures\ndirectly from the wound site for diagnostic purposes″ to opine that the plaintiff’s death was caused by\nhis on-the-job injury rather than his preexisting conditions. 1475 The Texas Supreme Court held that this\nexperience, in combination with the factual predicate to which was applied (specifically, evidence that\nthe plaintiff was in good health before the injury despite his preexisting conditions and evidence that\nthe plaintiff contracted an infection at the injury site within days after the injury occurred), were\nsufficiently reliable to support the physician’s causation opinion. 1476 But the Court was careful to note\nthat, as discussed above, 1477 the mere fact that the physician relied on his medical experience and the\nwell-accepted differential diagnosis technique to determine the cause of the plaintiff’s injury did not\nexempt the physician’s testimony from scrutiny. 1478 Here the [*244] expert’s experience functioned\nas predicate data for the expert’s opinion.\n\nImportantly, the Crump Court applied both the Daubert factors and Gammill’s ″analytical gap″ test to\nthe expert’s testimony, stating that ″the mere fact that differential diagnosis was used does not exempt\nthe foundation of a treating physician’s expert opinion from scrutiny - it is to be evaluated for\nreliability as carefully as any other expert’s testimony. Both the Daubert factors and Gammill analyses\nare appropriate in this context.″ 1479 Before Crump, courts of appeals had frequently applied only the\nGammill test to determine the reliability of expert medical opinions based primarily on the physician’s\nexperience and training. 1480 The Court clarified in Crump that both tests apply, though not all of the\nDaubert factors are relevant to differential diagnosis testimony. 1481 Applying the Daubert factors, the\nCourt observed that the physician’s differential diagnosis had been used for nonlitigation purposes -\n1475\n       Transcon.

Ford Motor Co., in which a plaintiff asserted that his asthma was caused by chemicals\nreleased when his airbag deployed during a car accident, a Texas court of appeals held that a treating\nphysician could not rely on his physical examination of the plaintiff, his review of medical literature,\nand his experience treating two other patients with similar symptoms to reach a reliable opinion on\ncausation. 1486 The court first rejected the expert’s reliance on his physical examination of the plaintiff:\n″A treating physician’s assertion that a physical examination confirmed causation should not be\naccepted at face value.″ 1487 The court observed that the expert did not state whether his theory\nsatisfied any of the Daubert factors. 1488 The court rejected the expert’s reliance on medical literature\nbecause the expert failed to identify what literature he read or whether the literature consisted of\npeer-reviewed studies. 1489 With regard to the expert’s reliance on his experience treating other\npatients, the court stated that the expert’s ″treatment of those two patients and [the plaintiff] does not\nqualify as a scientific study that meets the statistical requirements of Havner or that can be tested or\nreviewed by [the expert’s] peers.″ 1490 The court recognized the ″widespread acceptance″ of the\ndifferential diagnosis technique in the medical industry but discredited the expert’s use of that\nmethodology because the expert failed to properly perform the ″ruling out″ step of eliminating other\nplausible causes of the injury. 1491\nThe Texas Supreme Court has indicated that only in ″very few cases″ will courts be able to assess\nreliability based on the Daubert factors to the exclusion of the expert’s experience or based on the\nexpert’s experience to the exclusion of the Daubert [*246] factors; both should be reviewed. 1492 In\nthose rare cases when courts may assess methodological reliability based solely on experience, we\nsuggest that the court is not substituting the qualifications gate for the methodological reliability gate;\ninstead, the methodology employed by the expert is, in fact, the observational gathering of empirical\ndata through experience - a methodology that may (or may not) be valid for reaching a particular\n1482\n       Id.\n1483\n       Id.\n1484\n       Id. at 218 (alterations omitted) (quoting Viterbo v.

Expert opinions on the standard of care are based on the ordinary negligence standard\nof care, an issue that juries ordinarily can evaluate without expert assistance, as modified in light of\nthe defendant’s expertise, a modification that typically requires expert explanation. 1494 The\ndetermination of what is reasonable under a given set of circumstances involves a normative analysis,\nnot readily susceptible to the scientific [*247] method, 1495 but this is not troubling because the jury\nitself is considered well equipped to make such normative judgments. 1496 What expert testimony\nbrings to the table in these instances is the expert’s specialized knowledge, training, and experience,\nwhich is consistent with the defendant’s relevant knowledge, training, and experience; 1497 thus, in\nopining on the applicable standard of care, the expert necessarily relies on such knowledge, training,\nand experience as a predicate. The reliability of that predicate and the expert’s qualifications to offer\ntestimony on the subject naturally overlap. 1498 When the admissibility of expert testimony on the\napplicable standard of care is challenged on reliability grounds (rather than qualifications), courts\n1493\n        In the beekeeper example, for instance, the Texas Supreme Court indicated that the beekeeper’s experience in observing ″enough\nbees in various circumstances to show a pattern″ would be a sufficient basis for his opinion that bees take off into the wind.

Rev. 1, *249\n\n [*249] Expert opinions by physicians offer a good example: a broad statement that physicians can or\ncannot reach opinions based on their experience should be avoided because the reliability of the\nexperience depends on how the physician is using this data. 1503 When a physician testifies about the\nstandard of care, that opinion is generally based at least in part on the physician’s own experiences,\n1504\n     and the gathering of those experiences could be described very generally as a methodology. When\nphysicians testify about an expected outcome from certain medical devices, prescription drugs, or\nphysical ailments based on their patients’ outcomes under similar conditions, the predicate data may\nprovide a sufficiently reliable basis provided the expert has an adequate quantity of experience. 1505\nWhen a physician testifies about causation based on a differential diagnosis, courts often require the\nphysician’s initial determination of general causation in which the physician identifies all relevant\npotential causes of the subject’s symptoms to have a more reliable predicate than simply experience\nbut are often more accepting of experience as a reliable predicate for eliminating likely alternative\ncauses. 1506 Some argue that physicians are not in the business of diagnosing cause; they are in the\nbusiness of treating patients. 1507 But [*250] sometimes physicians’ treatment decisions require them\nto determine the cause of an ailment. Thus, the type of opinion offered by the physician may impact\nthe scrutiny to which it is subjected and whether the Daubert factors will apply.\n\nAccident reconstructionists are an excellent example of experts who use predicative data, methodology,\nand logical reasoning to reach subsidiary opinions that lead to an ultimate opinion on the cause of an\naccident. The Texas Supreme Court has stated that the Robinson factors ″are particularly difficult to\napply in vehicular accident cases involving accident reconstruction.″ 1508 With regard to an accident\nwas developed for litigation purposes by examining whether the expert has ever claimed this experience outside a litigation setting, such\nas in speeches or in training of other experts.\n1503\n     We discuss physicians’ use of experience as a predicate for opinion evidence in the previous section.

Clark below, reconstructionists often rely heavily on\nextrapolations from predicate data. 1512 Thus, their opinions often are best analyzed under connective\nreliability and predicative reliability gates. 1513 For these two gates, the Daubert [*251] factors do not\napply (except possibly to the extent the predicate data include literature subject to review for the\nauthor’s methodology). Instead, courts should examine predicative and connective reliability. As for all\nexperts it is important to analyze each opinion of the accident reconstructionist separately; thus, when\na reconstructionist cannot reliably create the entire accident sequence, she might still reliably recreate\npart of the accident.\n\nOpinions by accident reconstructionists are also a good reminder that the three reliability gates are\ninterlocking and may overlap. 1514 A reconstructionist’s use of photographs to reach an opinion on\nvarious aspects of an accident could be called a methodology, which could under certain conditions be\ntested and published. 1515 But reaching conclusions from that data is also a logical reasoning process\nand therefore fits under the connective reliability gate. One reason that the gates interlock is that an\nexpert’s reasoning process could also be described as a methodology. For example, ″extrapolating from\nanimal studies″ could be described as a ″very general methodology.″ 1516\nsubjective interpretation; (3) the methodology’s potential rate of error; (4) whether the underlying theory or methodology has been\ngenerally accepted as valid by the accident reconstruction and post-collision fire investigation community; and (5) the non-judicial uses\nthat have been made of his methodology. These are similar to factors 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of those enumerated in Robinson. But, as we have\nsaid above, that is not to imply that the trial court was precluded from measuring Elwell’s methodology by Gammill’s analytical gap\nanalysis.″).\n1509\n       TXI Transp., 306 S.W.3d at 238.\n1510\n       Id.\n1511\n       Ford Motor Co. v.

Some of the investigator’s sub-opinions leading to the ultimate origin-of-fire\nconclusion may not be based on a methodology but on the predicate data of the expert’s experience.

Differential Diagnosis (Etiology). 1517 Differential diagnosis is a ″routine diagnostic method used in\ninternal medicine whereby a treating physician formulates a hypothesis [*252] as to likely causes of\na patient’s presented symptoms and eliminates unlikely causes by a deductive process of elimination.″\n1518\n     Differential diagnosis is a two-step process: first, the physician considers all relevant potential\ncauses of a patient’s symptoms (often referred to as ″ruling in″ potential causes); second, the physician\neliminates all but one potential cause or all but one set of integrated causes (often referred to as ″ruling\nout″ potential causes). 1519 Differential diagnosis is a well-accepted technique in the medical field and\nwhen performed by a treating physician, is not subject to the same heightened risk of bias that plagues\nepidemiological studies. 1520\n\nMany jurisdictions, including Texas, have recognized differential diagnosis as a suitable methodology\nby which medical experts can demonstrate specific causation. 1521 But ″the results of a differential\ndiagnosis are far from reliable per se.″ 1522 As one court has explained:\n\nCalling something a ″differential diagnosis″ or ″differential etiology″ does not by itself answer the\nreliability question but prompts three more: (1) Did the expert make an accurate diagnosis of the nature\nof the disease? (2) Did the expert reliably rule in the possible causes of it? (3) Did the expert reliably\n1517\n       This factor is sometimes referred to as differential diagnosis for physicians but it is more accurately described as differential\netiology because it is an attempt to use process-of-elimination reasoning to identify a cause. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical & Emotional Harm § 28 cmt. (c)(4) (2010) (″Courts frequently refer to the elimination of other known causes for a plaintiff\nby employing the medical terminology of ″differential diagnosis.’ … This technique is more accurately described as a ″differential\netiology.’″); Joseph Sanders & Julie Machal-Fulks, The Admissibility of Differential Diagnosis Testimony to Prove Causation in Toxic\nTort Cases: The Interplay of Adjective and Substantive Law, 64 Law & Contemp.

Iowa Fire Equipment Co., the court stated that the treating\nphysician testified about a medical differential diagnosis - the identification of the condition in order to determine its treatment - but not\nabout the a differential diagnosis, the identification of the condition’s cause.

If the court [*253] answers ″no″ to any of these questions, the court must\nexclude the ultimate conclusion reached. 1523\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has likewise rejected an argument for a ″less strict″ application of the\nRobinson factors to differential diagnosis evidence: ″The mere fact that differential diagnosis was used\ndoes not exempt the foundation of a treating physician’s expert opinion from scrutiny - it is to be\nevaluated for reliability as carefully as any other expert’s testimony.″ 1524\n\nOften the testifying expert is a treating physician who made the diagnosis, or a retained expert who\nmakes the diagnosis for purposes of the litigation by reviewing the claimant’s medical records. In\neither instance, the reliability review of the differential diagnosis focuses on the testifying expert’s own\nmethodology. 1525 But when the expert relies on some other source to ″rule in″ potential causes or to\n″rule out″ likely alternative causes, the other source will need to provide a reliable predicate for the\nexpert’s decision to include/exclude the potential cause. 1526\n\nThe first step in the differential-diagnosis technique, ″ruling in″ potential causes, overlaps the issue of\n″general causation″ - a [*254] physician cannot reliably identify a substance as a potential cause of\na patient’s injury if the substance does not cause that type of injury. The second step, ″ruling out″\npotential causes, focuses on a patient’s particular circumstances and thus addresses the narrower issue\nof ″specific causation.″ Differential-diagnosis evidence thus encompasses both general and specific\ncausation. Sometimes, a claimant will produce separate evidence of general causation to justify the\nexpert’s decision to ″rule in″ the substance in question as a potential cause of the claimant’s illness or\n\n\n1523\n       Tamraz, 620 F.3d at 674.\n1524\n        Crump, 330 S.W.3d at 216-17. On the other hand, some federal courts have indicated that a physician’s differential diagnosis\ntestimony may be afforded greater leeway in reliance on the physician’s experience and expertise. The Ninth Circuit recently held in\nMessick v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. that a district court erred in excluding a differential diagnosis where a physician ″repeatedly\nreferred to his own extensive clinical experience as the basis for his differential diagnosis, as well as his examination of [the plaintiff’s]\nrecords, treatment, and history.″ Messick v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., 747 F.3d 1193, 1198-99 (9th Cir. 2014). The court opined that\n″medicine partakes of art as well as science, and there is nothing wrong with a doctor relying on extensive clinical experience when\nmaking a differential diagnosis… . A doctor using a differential diagnosis grounded in significant clinical experience and examination\nof medical records and literature can certainly aid the trier of fact and cannot be considered to be offering ″junk science.’″ Id. The court\nstated that the expert was not obligated to ″identify the sole cause of a medical condition in order for his or her testimony to be reliable.\nIt is enough that a medical condition be a substantial causative factor.″ Id. at 1199.\nOther courts have been somewhat less deferential. In Bland v. Verizon Wireless, (VAW) L.L.C., for example, the Eighth Circuit held that\na physician’s testimony that the plaintiff’s ingestion of freon caused her exercise-induced asthma was unreliable because the physician\nfailed to investigate the home or other environments to determine other possible causes of asthma and most cases of exercise-induced\nasthma have no known cause. Bland v. Verizon Wireless, (VAW) L.L.C., 538 F.3d 893, 897-98 (8th Cir. 2008). The Eight Circuit\nindicated in Bland, as it has in prior cases, that a strong temporal link may be, but is not necessarily, sufficient to support an opinion\non causation. See id.; see also Flesner v. Bayer AG, 596 F.3d 884, 891 (8th Cir. 2010) (indicating that it is only in a ″narrow category″\nof cases that a temporal link alone will support causation); Bonner v. ISP Techs., Inc., 259 F.3d 924, 931 (8th Cir. 2001) (indicating that\nin some circumstances a temporal link is, alone, evidence of causation).\n1525\n       See, e.g., Crump, 330 S.W.3d at 217-18. Analysis of the reliability of an expert’s methodology is discussed in detail above.

Rev. 1, *254\n\ninjury. 1527 In that instance, general causation, which is typically reviewed first, will already be\nsupported by reliable evidence, which can then be relied on by the differential-diagnosis expert in his\ndecision to ″rule in″ the substance in question as a potential cause. But when there is not already\nreliable evidence of ″general causation,″ a differential-diagnosis expert will have to identify an\nadequate predicate for concluding that the substance in question is capable of causing the kind of injury\nsuffered by the claimant before the expert can ″rule in″ that substance as a potential cause. 1528 An\nexpert cannot rely on differential diagnosis evidence ″to circumvent the requirement of general\ncausation.″ 1529\nLikewise, a testifying physician cannot rely on evidence of general causation to bypass a reliable basis\nfor specific causation. 1530 Under Robinson and Havner, expert causation evidence - including expert\ncausation opinions based on a differential diagnosis technique (or any etiology technique) 1531 - [*255]\nmust adequately rule out other potential causes to provide any basis for a causation conclusion. 1532\nIn Crump, the Texas Supreme Court explained the parameters of this requirement:\nIn some cases, a physician’s differential diagnosis may be too dependent upon the physician’s\nsubjective guesswork or produce too great a rate of error - for example, when there are several\n1527\n      See Hollander v. Sandoz Pharm. Corp., 289 F.3d 1193, 1210-11 (10th Cir. 2002) (″In many of the decisions in which a differential\ndiagnosis has been deemed reliable, the party relying on the diagnosis has offered independently reliable evidence that the allegedly\ndangerous drug or substance had harmful effects.″ (citing examples)).\n1528\n       See, e.g., Johnson v. Arkema, Inc., 685 F.3d 452, 469 (5th Cir. 2012) (affirming exclusion of physician’s differential-diagnosis\ntestimony that certain chemicals caused claimant’s lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis when physician ruled-in the chemicals as\npotential causes based on the same evidence relied upon to establish general causation, which the court had already rejected).\n1529\n       Id. at 468-69.\n1530\n       See, e.g., Roche v. Lincoln Prop. Co., 175 F. App’x 597, 602-03 (4th Cir. 2006) (upholding exclusion of differential diagnosis\ntestimony because, among other shortcomings, the physician’s ″reliance on the literature addressing general causation is misplaced\nbecause the medical literature provides no scientific support for specific causation″).\n1531\n        The requirement that experts rule out other potential causes has been particularly important in manufacturing and design defect\ncases. See, e.g., Nissan Motor Co. v. Armstrong, 145 S.W.3d 131, 137 (Tex. 2004); see also TXI Transp. Co. v. Hughes, 306 S.W.3d 230,\n237 (Tex. 2010) (stating expert’s failure to rule out alternative causes of incident may render opinion unreliable); Ford Motor Co. v.\nLedesma, 242 S.W.3d 32, 42 (Tex. 2007) (″Texas law does not generally recognize a product failure or malfunction, standing alone, as\nsufficient proof of a product defect. Instead, we have held that ″a specific defect must be identified by competent evidence and other\npossible causes must be ruled out.’″ (footnotes omitted) (quoting Armstrong, 145 S.W.3d at 137)).\nIn Cooper Tire, the Texas Supreme Court held that plaintiffs’ expert could not use an etiological elimination of other potential causes\nto establish the existence of a manufacturing defect (not merely causation). Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez, 204 S.W.3d 797,\n807-08 (Tex. 2006). The Court stated, ″The universe of possible causes for the tire failure is simply too large and too uncertain to allow\nan expert to prove a manufacturing defect merely by the process of elimination. As stated above, even if plaintiffs had eliminated every\nconceivable reason for the tire failure other than a product defect existing when the tire left Cooper Tire’s plant, they did not eliminate\nthe possibility of a design defect.″ Id.\nThe requirement has also been discussed in a variety of other cases.

Still, if evidence presents ″other plausible causes of the\ninjury or condition that could be negated, the [proponent of the testimony] must offer evidence\nexcluding those causes with reasonable certainty.″ 1533\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has stated that ″a thorough occupational/exposure history and medical\nhistory″ are ″vitally important″ to the ruling-out step of differential diagnosis. 1534\n\nThe ruling-in step of the differential diagnosis process may be too dependent on guess work when a\nsignificant number of the incidents of the disease in question are attributed to idiopathic (i.e., [*256]\nunknown) causes. On remand, the district court in Milward 1535 excluded the testimony of an expert\nwho attempted to use a differential diagnosis technique to conclude that the plaintiff’s AML was\ncaused by exposure to the defendant’s product because the expert could not reliably eliminate other\nprobable causes of AML. 1536 The court stated that the ″fundamental problem with differential\ndiagnosis in this context″ was that ″between 70 and 80 percent of cases of AML are idiopathic -\nmeaning they have no known cause.″ 1537 The court observed:\n\nWhen a disease has a discrete set of causes, eliminating some number of them significantly raises the\nprobability that the remaining option or options were the cause-in-fact of the disease. The same cannot\nbe said when eliminating a few possible causes leaves not only fewer possible causes but also a high\nprobability that a cause cannot be identified. 1538\n\nAt least one Texas appellate court has likewise indicated that when a disease is frequently idiopathic,\nit may be more difficult for an expert to reliably determine causation through differential diagnosis.\n1539\n\n\n\n3. Conclusion. Courts cannot mechanically use the Daubert factors as a checklist (e.g., ″reliability wins\nby a score of 4 to 2″). The factors are too flexible, sometimes overlap, and often need to be\nsupplemented with other factors for such a rule. More importantly, as courts have gradually\nrecognized, the crucial question is whether the expert has presented enough empirical data and\nreasoning to validate the proposition that by using this theory or technique he can accurately draw the\nproposed specific inference in question.\n1533\n     Transcon.

Joiner, the U.S. Supreme Court held:\n\nNothing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion\nevidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert. A [*257] court may\nconclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\n1541\n\n\n\nSeven months later, in Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., the Texas Supreme Court said, ″The\nsame is true of Robinson and the Texas Rules of Evidence: ″It is not so simply because an expert says\nit is so.’″ 1542 We treat this reliability test as the sixth gate: connective reliability. 1543 One commentator\nhas described this ″analytical gap″ test as ″a more abstract and flexible method of measuring\nreliability.″ 1544\n\n[*258] This gate may be the most important gate for practice in Texas courts because it is often used\nby appellate lawyers to raise challenges to expert testimony for the first time after the jury renders a\n1540\n       For a further discussion of connective reliability and its early development in the law, see Brown, supra note 1, at 804-11.\n1541\n       Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997); see also, e.g., Winters v. Fru-Con Inc., 498 F.3d 734, 743 (7th Cir. 2007)\n(quoting Clark v. Takata Corp., 192 F.3d 750, 757 (7th Cir. 1999)). Joiner applied the test to an expert’s extrapolation from animal studies\nto humans - the gap between the two needed to be bridged. Joiner, 522 U.S. at 143-44. And the exposures in the animal studies in Joiner\ncreated an additional gap - the animals were exposed to much higher levels of PCBs over a longer period of time than the claimant in\nJoiner had been. Id. at 144. In Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, the Court explained that a trial court must examine the expert’s ″particular\nmethod of analyzing the data … to draw a conclusion regarding the particular matter.″ Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137,\n154 (1999).\n1542\n      Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 726 (Tex. 1998) (quoting Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, 953\nS.W.2d 706, 712 (Tex. 1997)). The Court observed that the expert failed ″to show how his observations, assuming they were valid,\nsupported his conclusions,″ leaving a fatal ″analytical gap″ in the process that produced the expert’s opinion. Id. at 727.\n\nIn adopting Joiner, the Gammill Court quotes Havner, which dealt in part with expert reliance on animal studies to support a conclusion\nrelating to causation in humans, similar to the excluded testimony in Joiner. See Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 729-30. Because it predated\nJoiner and Gammill, Havner rejected the expert testimony presented under a predicative-reliability analysis, concluding that the\nepidemiological studies and animal studies on which the expert relied did not provide an adequate basis for his opinions. See id. at 730.\nThe Havner Court’s analysis of the expert’s reliance on epidemiological studies is well-suited for the predicative-reliability gate - the\nepidemiological studies reached ″just the opposite″ conclusion on causation than the expert did, and they therefore provided no support\nfor his conclusion. Id. But the Court’s analysis of the expert’s reliance on animal studies would have been better-suited for the\nconnective-reliability gate later developed in Joiner and Gammill - studies evidencing causation in animals (as opposed to studies failing\nto find any evidence of causation in humans) could support an expert’s conclusion on causation in humans if the expert adequately\nbridged the ″gap″ between the animal-related data and the human-related opinion by, for example, providing adequately supported\ntestimony demonstrating substantial similarity between animals and humans with regard to the effect of the substance in question and\nthe etymology of the disease in question.\n1543\n       The phrase ″connective reliability″ is based on the Joiner opinion, which was quoted with approval by Gammill: ″Nothing in either\nDaubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a … court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the\nipse dixit of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.″\nJoiner, 522 U.S. at 146 (cited with approval by Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 726) (emphasis added); see also Ronald J.

Rev. 1131, 1136-37 (1993) (arguing evidentiary\nrules should force experts to educate jury on reasons for expert’s opinion so jury can make its own intelligent decision, not keep\ninformation from the jury and thus force jury to blindly defer to or reject expert’s inferences).\n1544\n       Kimberly S.

L. Rev. 1, *258\n\nverdict. In the wake of Joiner and Gammill, the ″ipse dixit″ and ″analytical gap″ language has echoed\nthroughout hundreds of Texas expert opinion cases. 1545 Most of these cases involve postjudgment\nlegal-sufficiency challenges to expert evidence, rather than prejudgment challenges to the admissibility\nof the evidence. Typically, the party who lost at trial argues that the expert testimony offered by the\nprevailing party to prove an element of his cause of action is conclusory - it is the ″mere ipse dixit of\na credentialed witness″ and ″there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the\nopinion proffered″ - and therefore the testimony constitutes ″no evidence″ to support the judgment in\nthe prevailing party’s favor. 1546 As discussed above, postjudgment attacks on the reliability of expert\ntestimony pose a particularly potent threat because the evidence in the case is closed and the party\nproffering the evidence has no opportunity to supplement the record with additional materials or\nexplanation. 1547 As a practical matter, the connective reliability requirement may be an especially\npowerful tool on appeal because it is founded in logic, rather than scientific expertise, and thus may\nbe ″more readily [*259] understood and applied″ than the Daubert factors. 1548 ″The nature of the\nstudies in each case, the plausibility of the extrapolations from them, and the known soundness of the\n\n\n\n1545\n       See, e.g., Elizondo v.

Daubert provides that ″any step that renders the analysis unreliable\n… renders the expert’s testimony inadmissible. This is true whether the step completely changes a\nreliable methodology or merely misapplies that methodology.″ 1552\n\nThis is also true when the expert cannot connect foundational data to the expert’s conclusions. Thus,\nthere are two [*260] principal types of ″gaps″ that can undermine the reliability of an expert’s opinion:\n(1) a gap between the underlying data, facts, or assumptions and the opinion; and (2) a gap between\nthe expert’s methodology and the opinion. 1553 Texas courts have found fatal analytical gaps both\nbetween the predicative data and the conclusion 1554 and between the methodology and the conclusion.\n1555\n     When the expert’s reasoning from premise to conclusion includes a leap of faith, the leap, if big\nenough, necessitates exclusion of the opinion as an improper extrapolation regardless of whether the\npremise is a methodology, technique, or data relied on by the expert. 1556 And even if the opinion is\nadmitted without objection, the opinion may be deemed conclusory and therefore ″no evidence.″ 1557\n\n1549\n       David H.

As discussed in this section, Texas courts have generally focused\non the ″analytical gap″ language rather than language referencing the reliability of the expert’s ″application″ of scientific or technical\nprinciples and methods to the facts of the case. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals requires that an expert’s technique be reliably\napplied in the context of scientific expert testimony. Emerson v. State, 880 S.W.2d 759, 763-69 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (en banc) (taking\njudicial notice of (1) the validity of the scientific theory of HGN testing and (2) the validity of the technique applying the theory and\nholding that the remaining Kelly admissibility issue - whether the officer properly applied the theory - had to be established by the State);\nKelly v.

At least one Texas appellate court has rejected a strict, mechanical application of this requirement, noting that minor\nvariations in application of a technique may affect only the weight and not the admissibility of the evidence. See, e.g., McCarthy v. State,\nNo. 01-12-00240-CR, 2013 WL 5521926, at 3, 6 (Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] Oct. 3, 2013, no pet.) (″Emerson squarely places the\nburden on the proponent of the HGN testing - in this case, the State - to establish that the officer properly applied the HGN test″ but\nslight variations in its administration ″do not render the evidence inadmissible or unreliable, but may affect the weight to give the\ntestimony.″ (quoting McRae v.

Helton. 1597 While the Court did not use the term\n″conclusory,″ the Court’s analysis demonstrates when an opinion will be deemed conclusory. Helton\nconcerned the probative value of expert testimony on the quantity of gas that would be produced from\na hypothetical well 1598 The expert relied on data from two surrounding wells to make his projections.\n1599\n     But the Court held that this data, even if it was of the type relied upon by experts in the field and\neven if it was accurate, did not support the expert’s opinion because of an analytical gap between the\ndata and the expert’s conclusion. 1600\n\n\n\n1339)); but they generally have not relied on this principle as a means of holding that a reliability challenge may be raised for the first\ntime after the verdict. See supra note 458.\n1592\n       See supra Part III.A.2.b.\n1593\n       See supra Part III.A.2.b.\n1594\n       See supra Part III.A.2.b.\n1595\n        The First Court of Appeals held in a recent case that an analytical gap objection was waived because it was not timely made in\nthe trial court. Church v. Exxon Mobil Corp., No. 01-11-00802-CV, 2012 WL 5381233, at 4-5 (Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] Nov. 1,\n2012, no pet.) (mem. op.). The defendant’s expert explained the factual basis for his opinions that an accident where a restroom sink fell\nand injured the plaintiff did not occur as the plaintiff described it: he based his conclusions on the outcomes of his experiments, which\nhe described in detail. Id. at 2-3. On appeal, the plaintiffs complained that the expert’s experiments did not take into account some of\nthe conditions in the restroom and testimony from two witnesses. Id. at 3. The court of appeals stated that an evaluation of the merits\nof this complaint would require it to evaluate the expert’s\nunderlying methodology, technique, or foundational data. That is, we must examine whether too great an analytical gap exists between\nthe conditions present during [the] experiments and the conditions in the … restroom on the day [in question]. This is precisely the type\nof complaint that requires the appellant to have made a timely objection in the trial court.\nId. at 5 (citations omitted). This opinion highlights that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a challenge to the foundational\ndata and a challenge to an analytical gap because an analytical gap challenge necessarily requires reviewing the underlying data in order\nto determine the size of the gap between the data and the conclusion.\n1596\n       See supra Part III.A.\n1597\n       Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Helton, 133 S.W.3d 245, 247, 258 (Tex. 2004). Neither Robinson nor Havner describe the expert testimony\nthat was unreliable in those cases as conclusory. Havner did state that ″speculative testimony″ is insufficient. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.\nv. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 719 (Tex. 1997). In Gammill, the first analytical gap case in Texas, the Court affirmed a summary judgment\nfor the defendant because of unreliable expert testimony. Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 715, 728 (Tex.\n1998). The Court did not label the unreliable testimony as ″conclusory,″ ″incompetent,″ or ″no evidence.″\n1598\n       Helton, 133 S.W.3d at 257-58.\n1599\n       Id. at 255, 257.\n1600\n       Id. at 258.\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 206 of 230\n                                                       52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *268\n\nHelton argued that Kerr-McGee did not preserve error because in the trial court it had objected only\nto the expert’s foundational data, not to the expert’s methodology. 1601 The Court agreed that the\ndefendant’s trial objection was what we call predicative reliability - that the opinion ″was not\nsufficiently supported with facts or data″ 1602 - but held the flaw in the expert’s reasoning fell within\nthis issue.\n\nIn any event, the Court focused on the analytical gap between the data and the opinion. The Court\nobserved that the hypothetical well had characteristics of a lower performing well than the two wells\nused for comparison, and some of the [*269] characteristics of the hypothetical well - such as its\nporosity and permeability - were unknown. 1603 Although it was ″possible that the hypothetical well\nwould have produced as much as [the expert] projected,″ the Court’s task ″is not to determine whether\n[the expert’s] opinion regarding the hypothetical well’s productivity is correct.″ 1604 The Court\nacknowledged that the expert offered possible explanations for his conclusions; nevertheless, he did\nnot ″testify with any specificity how these factors affected his calculations.″ 1605 The expert ″failed to\nsufficiently explain″ why the differences between his predicted well and the comparison wells ″would\nnot result in different production rates.″ 1606 Quoting Gammill, the Court stated that ″the gap in [the\nexpert’s] analysis was his ″failure to show how his observations … supported his conclusions.’″ 1607\nThe expert’s opinion therefore was ″incompetent″ and no evidence. 1608\n\nJustice Hecht concurred, noting an analytical gap between the factual premises - the geology of the\narea, the characteristics of the wells used for comparison, and other factors affecting a well’s\nproduction - and the expert’s conclusions. 1609 But he added one other reason for rejecting the\ntestimony: the expert’s methodology did not comply with industry standards for determining where to\ndrill. ″Reliability does not mean one thing outside the courtroom and something less inside. If the\nindustry would rely on expert analysis like [the expert’s] to determine where to drill, then it was\nreliable for purposes of the trial. If not, it should not have been admitted.″ 1610\n1601\n        Id. at 252-53. Helton also presented a second preservation of error issue because the defendant did not object to the testimony\nuntil immediately after cross-examination. Id. at 251-52. The Court concluded that the objection was not too late because the basis for\nthe objection became apparent during the cross-examination. Id. at 252. Moreover, the plaintiff was not subject to trial by ambush and\nhad the opportunity to respond to the objection.

L. Rev. 1, *269\n\nArguably, the Court also signaled more willingness to consider reliability challenges raised for the first\ntime postverdict by rejecting the plaintiff’s contention that the defendant waived error when it failed\nto object to two documents that summarized [*270] the expert’s opinion. The exhibits contained the\nsame unreliable damages calculation as the testimony. The Court reasoned that if the opinion is\nunreliable, the exhibits were also unreliable and no evidence. 1611 The failure to object did not waive\nerror because the defendant’s challenge was a no-evidence challenge, rather than a challenge to\nadmissibility. 1612 The Court did not address why this no-evidence holding did not eliminate the need\nto address whether the expert challenge was timely; if the opinion was conclusory due to an analytic\ngap, there was no need to make an objection to either the testimony or the exhibit. As discussed above,\nsuch a holding would have been arguably consistent with the Court’s subsequent holdings on error\npreservation, particularly Pollock. 1613\n\nThe key point in Helton, at least for error preservation purposes, was its holding that the expert’s\ntestimony was incompetent because of an analytical gap. This holding was important because of two\nother well-established preservation rules: (1) incompetent evidence does not support a judgment ″even\nif admitted without objection″; 1614 and (2) conclusory testimony ″cannot support a judgment even\nwhen no objection was made to the statements at trial.″ 1615 The Court in Helton treated the expert’s\nopinion as conclusory.\n\nIn the same year that the Court decided Helton, the Court held in Ramirez, that an expert’s opinion was\nconclusory despite the expert’s incantation of scientific principles, physical evidence, and testing. 1616\nThe driver of a Passat was killed when the vehicle went across the grassy median and crashed into an\noncoming vehicle. 1617 It was undisputed that the left rear wheel separated from the vehicle; the dispute\nwas whether the crash caused the separation or the separation caused the crash. The defendant did not\nobject to the expert’s methodology used to conclude that the rear wheel of the plaintiff’s car came loose\nfrom the axle causing the accident. 1618 The Court therefore was limited [*271] to reviewing the face\nof the record. 1619 But that limited review demonstrated that even if the methodology was reliable, ″the\nfacts on which he relied did not support his conclusion.″ 1620\n\n1611\n       Id. at 252 (majority opinion).\n1612\n       Id.\n1613\n       See supra notes 322-26 and accompanying text.\n1614\n       City of Keller v.

L. Rev. 1, *271\n\nA metallurgist testified that a defect existed in a metal bearing in the axle, and also offered testimony\nthat the wheel assembly broke before - not after - the collision. 1621 While his testimony was lengthy,\nthe metallurgist did not identify any data, testing, or physical evidence (other than the grass in the\nwheel hub) supporting his causation opinion. 1622 For example, the expert’s testimony that a defect in\nthe Passat’s left rear wheel assembly would be consistent with ″erratic vehicle behavior″ was an\n″unsupported conclusion″ because the expert did not identify any supporting data such as other\ntestimony, tests, and skid marks. 1623 The one piece of physical evidence the metallurgist relied on -\nthe finding of grass in the wheel hub - was ″just as consistent with the wheel coming off in the median\nafter the Passat went out of control as it is with a wheel separation prior to entering the median.″ 1624\nFinally, the metallurgist’s testimony failed ″to answer a crucial question raised by the [plaintiff’s]\ntheory of causation - how the floating wheel stayed in the wheel well as the Passat traveled through\nthe median and collided with the Mustang.″ 1625 Thus, the metallurgist’s causation opinion was\nconclusory. 1626 The Court concluded that the causation opinion was conclusory because of ″fatal gaps\nin an expert’s analysis… . While juries are important to our legal system, they cannot credit as some\nevidence expert opinions that are not reliable or are conclusory on their face. These principles are\nconsistent with a legal-sufficiency review.″ 1627\n\n [*272] Justice Hecht’s concurrence detailed other gaps in the metallurgist’s analysis. While the\nmetallurgist performed a microscopic examination of the wheel bearing, he did not ″connect [his]\nobservations with his conclusions″ except through his ″so-say.″ 1628 He did not present any ″objective\ntests that actually associate microscopic conditions with producing causes, or by statistical correlations\nbetween such conditions and bearing failures, or by analyses in the professional literature of the\n\n1621\n       Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 910-11.\n1622\n       Id. at 911.\n1623\n       Id. at 905-06, 911.\n1624\n       Id. at 911.\n1625\n       Id.\n1626\n       The Court stated that the bulk of the testimony relied upon by the dissent concerned his opinion on the existence of a defect, not\ncausation. Id. at 911-12.\n1627\n       Id. The Court also held that an accident reconstructionist’s testimony that the vehicle’s left rear wheel detached from the stub axle\nat the time of the collision but stayed ″tucked underneath″ the left rear wheel well as the car went across the grassy median was\ninadmissible. Id. at 904, 906. The expert relied on the ″laws of physics″ as the basis for his ″floating wheel″ theory and provided a very\nshort explanation. Id. at 904. But that explanation was insufficient. Id. at 906. He also relied on ″generally accepted″ accident\nreconstruction principles, but again these principles were general and he did not show how they led to his conclusion. See id. at 905-06.\nHe did perform tests but those tests concerned how the bearing failed and not when it failed. Id. Looking to the Daubert factors, the Court\nobserved that he did not rely on any supporting tests, studies, or calculations and therefore failed to show any connection between his\ndata and opinion. Id. at 904-06. His opinion was ″based solely upon his subjective interpretation of the facts.″ Id. at 906. Thus, the\nRamirez Court treats the Daubert factors as part of its analysis of whether an analytical gap exists; the expert could have tried to fill the\ngap between the data of the accident and the opinion with tests or literature but he failed to do so.\nIn Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, the Court summarized Ramirez as holding that expert testimony that ″failed to account for the\nsequence of events″ was conclusory. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 313 S.W.3d 837, 839 (Tex. 2010).

Rather than indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the jury’s finding, the Court\nadopts a contrary approach, tipping the scale in the opposite direction to dismiss as ″conclusory″ expert\ntestimony that supports the verdict. 1632\n\nHe observed that the expert’s methodology was unchallenged and that the expert’s conclusions were\n″in a technical area in which judges have no particular expertise″ and therefore should be reviewed\nunder factual sufficiency, not legal sufficiency. 1633\n\nLess than two years after Ramirez, in Cooper Tire, a 2006 manufacturing defect case, the Court utilized\nthe Daubert factors in holding that a former tire technician’s opinion was speculative [*273] and an\nengineer’s opinion was conclusory and therefore the opinions were no evidence to support the jury\nverdict. 1634 The former tire technician’s opinion that a tire separated because of wax contamination\nduring the manufacturing process was unsupported by any scientific testing, peer-reviewed studies, or\nany support in the scientific community. 1635 It was nothing more than ″subjective belief or\nunsupported speculation″ - essentially a ″naked hypothesis untested and unconfirmed by the methods\nof science,″ and was legally insufficient to establish a manufacturing defect that caused the failure. 1636\nThe bulk of the testimony by the second expert, an engineer, addressed other issues, but he also\ntestified, over one and one-half pages of transcript, that the tire contained a manufacturing defect based\non his microscopic examination and x-rays of the tire. 1637 The Court stated that he offered the opinion\nin a ″conclusory fashion.″ 1638 His opinion was not supported by the Daubert factors; it was subjective\nand unsupported by any testing or peer-reviewed literature. 1639 There was no proof that his\nobservational technique - his methodology - was generally accepted or used in non-judicial contexts.\n1629\n       Id. at 912-13.\n1630\n       Id. at 913.\n1631\n       Id. at 915-17 (Jefferson, C.J., dissenting).\n1632\n       Id. at 917 (footnote omitted).\n1633\n      Id. at 917 n.3.

Mack Trucks, therefore, is\nanother example of the Court using the Daubert factors in determining that an expert’s testimony had\nno support and therefore was no evidence.\n\nIn its 2009 decision in Whirlpool, the Texas Supreme Court held that an expert’s failure to offer ″an\nexplanation of why″ testing of the expert’s opinion was not performed may, along with the absence of\nother Daubert factors, rendered that opinion conclusory. 1646 The plaintiffs brought a wrongful death\naction against the clothes dryer manufacturer after a house fire. 1647 An electrical engineer testified that\nthe dryer was defectively designed because it allowed accumulated lint to be drawn into the heater\nwhere it ignited. 1648 The Court stated that the reliability inquiry includes a rigorous examination of\n″the manner in which the principles and methodologies are applied by the expert to reach the\nconclusions.″ 1649 First, the Court analyzed the opinion under the analytical gap test. 1650 The expert\nrelied on a report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission but he did not explain how it supported\n1640\n       Id.\n1641\n       Id.

Krist, a legal malpractice lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged that their\nattorney failed to obtain an adequate settlement for personal injuries suffered in an industrial plant\nexplosion. 1657 The significance of Elizondo is that it makes more explicit that a sufficiently large\nanalytical gap in the expert’s reasoning makes the expert’s opinion conclusory; the question remains\nhow large the gap must be.\n1651\n        Id. at 642.

In Burrow the affidavit was submitted in support of the defendant law firm’s\ntraditional summary judgment motion. 1659 The attorney-affiant in Elizondo represented more than 500\nof the over 4000 claimants in litigation arising from the explosion and served as the court-appointed\nplaintiffs’ liaison counsel with the defendant on discovery issues. 1660 The attorney, based on this\nexperience, identified ten criteria used by the plant owner to determine a claimant’s settlement value.\n1661\n     He opined that the case had a settlement value of forty to sixty times the settlement amount\nobtained by the lawyer-defendant based on four criteria: (1) the injured worker’s injuries and work\nhistory; (2) the lawyer’s experience in the litigation arising out of this explosion; (3) his knowledge of\ngeneral settlement values; and (4) the settlement criteria used by the plant owner. 1662 The expert did\nnot state, however, how he applied these factors to determine the settlement value.\n\nAs discussed above, the Court approved the attorney’s reliance on the defendant’s other settlements\nwith similarly situated plaintiffs as a predicate for his opinion about the value of the plaintiffs’ claims.\n1663\n      The Court also approved of the general methodology, observing that an expert may reach an\nopinion on malpractice damages ″by persuasively comparing all the circumstances of the case to the\nsettlements obtained in other cases with similar circumstances arising from the event.″ 1664 But the\nattorney affidavit fell short at the connective reliability gate because the attorney merely stated that he\nconsidered these factors and that based on them the Court should ″take his word that the settlement was\ninadequate.″ 1665 The expert did not provide a ″reasoned basis″ for concluding the settlements were\ninadequate nor did he ″explain why″ the settlements were unreasonable. 1666 Specifically, even though\nthe expert explained how strong or weak the plaintiffs’ [*277] claims were on each of the factors\nconsidered by the defendant in determining settlement amounts, because the expert did not disclose the\namount of any of the other settlements, there was no means by which to compare the settlement amount\nof similarly situated plaintiffs to the settlement amount at issue. 1667 The expert ″failed to link″ the\nsettlement amount to the factors of the case. 1668 Thus, ″[a] fatal analytical gap divided the recitation\nof the facts … and the declaration of its settlement value″ and the expert’s opinions were conclusory.\n1669\n\n\n1658\n       Burrow v.

Ledesma, a claim involving a\nmanufacturing defect in the u-bolts holding a truck’s rear axle to its rear springs. 1678 The critical\nfactual dispute was whether the truck’s axle dislodged and caused the accident or whether the axle\ndislodged as a result of the accident. 1679 Ledesma’s expert, a mechanical engineer, opined that the\nmanufacturer did not sufficiently tighten the u-bolts fastening the drive shaft to the truck. 1680 The\nexpert relied on his measurements of various truck components and on various Ford specifications. 1681\nHis inspection revealed that the u-bolts were under-torqued, but the torques might have changed due\nto the accident. 1682 He explained a number of reasons that the u-bolt could have become under-torqued\nduring manufacturing, and identified a number of his observations of the components that ″were\nconsistent with his theory of a u-bolt that was loose before the accident.″ 1683 Because the expert\n1670\n       Hous.

Clark Freight Lines, Inc, a wrongful death lawsuit arising from an\nintersection collision. 1701 The plaintiff sought to exclude the opinion of a qualified sheriff’s deputy\nthat the decedent’s father, who was driving a Ford Mustang, and not the tractor-trailer driven by the\ndefendant, ran the red light. 1702 The plaintiff contended on appeal that an analytical gap existed\nbetween the data and the deputy’s conclusions. 1703\n\nFirst, the plaintiff argued that because the deputy used a Camaro in his coefficient of friction test, rather\nthan a Mustang, all of the opinions drawn from his calculations were flawed. 1704 In other words, the\nplaintiff argued that the expert could not extrapolate data from one type of vehicle to another type of\nvehicle. The court rejected this contention, noting the deputy’s testimony that the differences between\nthe Camaro and the Mustang had no effect on the coefficient of friction value. 1705 For example, while\nthe Mustang had a manual transmission and the Camaro had an automatic transmission, those\ndifferences did not alter the coefficient of friction value. 1706 Similarly, the expert explained that the\nweight difference between the vehicles ″did not matter″ in determining the coefficient of friction. 1707\nThe [*282] deputy ″explained why″ - a key ingredient for connective reliability 1708 - the\ndissimilarities between the Camaro and the Mustang did not affect the coefficient of friction value. 1709\nLooking to the law on admissibility of experiments, the court stated that when dissimilarities between\nan accident and a reconstructed experiment are minor and either can be made clear by explanation or\ndo not affect the test result, a trial court is within its discretion to admit experiment data. 1710\n\nNext, the plaintiff contended that the deputy’s underlying data and methodology were unreliable\nbecause he did not use a Durometer to measure and compare the consistency of the tires between the\ntoo great an analytical gap between the doctor’s expert opinions and the basis for which they were founded - the expert’s experience -\nand rejecting contention that Havner requires epidemiological evidence in medical malpractice claim); In re D.S., 19 S.W.3d 525, 528-30\n(Tex.

The deputy admitted that a Durometer would have\nmeasured the hardness of the tires’ rubber, but he did not have one at the time of his accident\nreconstruction. 1712 He determined the hardness of the tire rubber between the Mustang and the\nCamaro by eyeballing the tires. 1713 By observing the tires on both vehicles, he could tell that the tires\nwere of a soft consistency. 1714 He testified that he had previously conducted testing with similar tires,\nboth on Mustangs and Camaros, and they would yield similar results. 1715 Based on his experience in\nconducting hundreds of tests with vehicles with soft rubber tires, regular passenger cars, and harder\ntruck tires, he concluded that the test results between the two types of vehicles were consistent. 1716\nHe chose the Camaro as a testing vehicle because it had soft rubber tires consistent with the wide, slick,\nsoft rubber tires that were on the Mustang. 1717 Consequently, while he did not use a Durometer, the\ndeputy’s experience in testing the coefficient of friction with similar tires was sufficient to provide a\nreliable basis for his conclusion. 1718 The court concluded the trial court did not err in finding that the\n [*283] expert’s testimony regarding the coefficient of friction and causation was reliable. 1719\n\nIn addition to demonstrating the importance of ″explaining how and why″ an expert extrapolates from\ndata to a conclusion, Lincoln teaches a second lesson: a gap may, in an appropriate case, be filled with\nexperience. The gap between the test results on the Camaro tire and the expert’s conclusions about the\nMustang was bridged by the expert’s experience testing tires. In Lincoln, the experience-gap-filler was\nextensive in a wide range of comparable settings. Thus, although the methodology of ″eyeballing″ the\ntires may not be appropriate to fill the gaps in some settings - such as a manufacturing defect claim\nagainst a tire manufacturer 1720 - it may be appropriate in other settings.\n\nTaber v.

The specific legal task this court is called upon to perform … must be\naccomplished in the context of specific testimony. This context encompasses not only the disputed\nexpert testimony itself, but also [the plaintiff’s] competing expert testimony and the testimony of fact\nwitnesses. 1726\n\nAlthough the defense experts ″acknowledged that no medical literature attributes permanent avulsion\ninjuries like the one [in question] to the natural forces of labor,″ both parties’ experts relied on a degree\nof interpretation ″in applying the existing literature to opine about causation based upon specific\ncircumstances″ in question. 1727 The court concluded that the twenty-two publications relied upon by\nthe defense were sufficient to bridge the gap between the theory and the infant’s specific avulsion\ninjury even though the causation issue ″unavoidably involves an element of speculation.″ 1728 Finally,\nthe court held that although the natural-forces-of-labor theory is a hypothesis, that label ″is not\ndispositive because this characterization by itself does not answer the reliability question. If the\n″hypothesis’ is supported by reliable data and methodology, and proffered in conformity with existing\nstandards governing admission of expert testimony, then it is admissible.″ 1729\n\nIn contrast, an expert’s attempt to link data to his conclusions failed because of a lack of transparency\nin Abraham v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., a toxic tort suit under the Federal Employers Liability Act\n(FELA) arising from railroad employees’ exposure to creosote used to treat railroad ties at an industrial\nplant. 1730 The trial court struck the plaintiffs’ causation expert, and granted the railroad summary\njudgment. 1731 The court of appeals began by observing that unreliable expert testimony amounts to\n1723\n       Id. at 160.\n1724\n       Id. at 146-47.\n1725\n       Id. at 153-54.\n1726\n       Id. at 154.\n1727\n       Id. at 154-56.\n1728\n       Id. at 156.\n1729\n      Id. at 159.

The court focused on the plaintiffs’ exposure levels at the\nplant because proof of the exposure level ″is essential to any reliable expert opinion that the particular\nsubstance caused a disease.″ 1734 The plaintiffs’ expert relied upon an EPA creosote study on exposure\nover an eight-hour day to provide descriptions of job categories of workers applying creosote in\ndifferent parts of a plant and corresponding creosote exposure levels. 1735 He testified that he\nextrapolated from the EPA data to form his opinion on the workers’ creosote exposures by examining\nthe workers’ depositions and concluding that their exposures were ″similar″ to those in the study. 1736\nHe did not include any specifics regarding his extrapolation methods nor did he take any notes\nregarding his extrapolations. 1737\nThe expert did prepare a chart rating each plaintiff’s purported exposure as high, medium, or low, but\nfailed to include any job category information for the workers even though the EPA study observed that\ndifferent job categories had different exposures. 1738 Instead, he correlated each plaintiff’s alleged\ncreosote exposure to the length of employment at the plant. 1739 Because a plaintiff must prove his\nexposure level using scientifically valid methods, the lack of evidence as to job categories meant the\ncourt could not determine whether any plaintiff had creosote exposure levels comparable to those in\nthe EPA study. 1740\nThe court held that ″scientific knowledge of the harmful level of exposure to a chemical plus\nknowledge that the plaintiffs were exposed to such quantities are minimal facts necessary to sustain the\nplaintiffs’ burden in a toxic tort case.″ 1741 Although production of a mathematically precise table\nequating levels of harm with levels of exposure was not necessary, production of evidence from which\na reasonable person could conclude that the exposure probably caused the injuries was necessary. 1742\nPlaintiffs’ lack of evidence of creosote exposures at levels equal to or greater than the exposures in the\nEPA study proved fatal to their case.

L. Rev. 1, *286\n\n4. Experience-Based Expert Testimony. The reliability of experience as a basis for an expert opinion\ncan be difficult to evaluate. One problem is that experience can be the foundation for an opinion, a\ngap-filler, or both. It is the predicative foundation for an opinion when it is the basis for the opinion.\nFor example, in a medical malpractice case, the expert may not rely on any textbooks or written\nstandards or guidelines to determine the standard of care; she might rely solely on her own experience.\nAnd in an area of medicine in which there are no written standards, experience may be the only\npotential basis from which to determine the standard of care. The same is true in a legal malpractice\ncase.\n                                                                                                                    1744\nBut that does not mean that the opinion is shielded from a reliability examination.\n\nIf courts merely accept ″experience″ as a substitute for proof that an expert’s opinions are reliable and\nthen only examine the testimony for analytical gaps in the expert’s logic and opinions, an expert can\neffectively insulate his or her conclusions from meaningful review by filling gaps in the testimony with\nalmost any type of data or subjective opinions. 1745\n\nThus, for an expert opinion based solely on the expert’s experience, courts at a minimum must examine\nwhether ″there is a sufficient connection between the existing data and the opinion offered or if there\nis ″simply too great an analytical gap’ for the expert testimony to be considered reliable.″ 1746\n\nAdditionally, as discussed in the section on predicate reliability, the experience must be substantial\nenough to warrant the conclusion that the expert can provide reliable testimony. Minimal relevant\nexperience - or a claim to experience that the expert cannot provide a meaningful description of - may\nbe insufficient. 1747\n\n [*287] The reason that the reliability of an opinion based on experience is not solely a predicative\nreliability question is that the expert often must make inferences or interpretations from that data. The\nAdvisory Committee’s notes give the following example of expert testimony based primarily on the\nexpert’s experience in the field:\n\nWhen a law enforcement agent testifies regarding the use of code words in a drug transaction, the\nprinciple used by the agent is that participants in such transactions regularly use code words to conceal\nthe nature of their activities.

So long as the principles and methods are reliable and\napplied reliably to the facts of the case, this type of testimony should be admitted. 1748\n\nIn this example, the expert takes his experience (or observations) - his predicate data - and applies that\ndata by logic, reasoning, and common sense to reach a conclusion. A court reviews that application\nunder connective reliability. The Daubert factors may have some applicability, but they are unlikely to\nbe decisive. To the extent the law enforcement agent relies purely on his own personal observation of,\nand participation in, similar transactions, like the beekeeper in Gammill, the agent’s predicate data is\nsufficiently reliable if the agent has observed the terms at issue used in ″enough [conversations] in\nvarious circumstances to show a pattern″ of usage. 1749 To the extent the agent also relies on literature\nand materials provided to him in training, the Daubert factors may come into play. 1750\n\nEven when the predicate data is extensive experience, courts must analyze connective reliability.\nProfessor Risinger explains, ″Substantial experience of relevant similarity to what is at issue [*288]\nin the case at hand is a necessary condition for the reliability of experience-based expertise, but in most\ncontexts it is not a sufficient condition to establish reliability.″ 1751 When an expert testifies not only\nto a summary of that experience, but also about inferences based on those experiences, the expert’s\nopinion ″is based in part on experience, but in part on some translation scheme to mediate between\nprevious experiences and a particular conclusion in this case. In those circumstances, reliability is\ndependent on both sufficient experience and a reliable translation system.″ 1752 This ″translation\nsystem″ may involve the application of some kind of scientific or technical method, subject to\nmethodological reliability, or it may involve logical reasoning, subject to connective reliability, or it\nmay involve both.\n\nExperience can also be a gap-filler. Experience may be the link used to reach a conclusion when the\npredicate data is insufficient. Sometimes experience is necessary to fill gaps. For example, an appraisal\nmay require some judgment calls about the selection of the appropriate data or the interpretation of the\ndata. 1753 Lincoln v.

The reliability of that data was undisputed.\n1770\n     The expert then used his experience to explain why several tests he performed were significant and\nhow they supported his opinions. 1771 In other words, he used his experience to extrapolate from the\ndata to reach his conclusion.\n\nIV. Conclusion & Practice Tips\n\nWe have attempted in Part III of this Article to demonstrate that the three reliability gates - predicative\nreliability, methodological reliability, and connective reliability - are inextricably intertwined,\noverlapping, and synergetic, but they are nevertheless distinct requirements that expert evidence must\nindependently satisfy to meet the standards for admissible and competent evidence. Each gate is\nnecessary, and no two gates are, alone, sufficient.\n\nIn Part III.A, we explored the availability of postverdict legal-sufficiency challenges to expert evidence\nand the rules and standards that govern such challenges on appeal. Particularly, we focused on when\na party may raise a legal-sufficiency challenge based on the unreliability of expert evidence, even\nthough the party did not raise that complaint before the evidence was admitted at trial. Part III.B\ndiscussed two kinds of predicative reliability - one that must be challenged preverdict to be preserved\nfor review on appeal (predicative soundness) and one that can be challenged for the first time after the\nverdict (predicative probativeness). In Part III.C, we examined methodological reliability and observed\nthat it typically cannot be the basis for a legal-sufficiency challenge if it was not first made the basis\nfor a timely challenge to admissibility in the trial court. But in Part III.D, we studied connective\nreliability, which can almost always be raised for the first time postverdict, and discovered that,\nperhaps because connective reliability links (and to some degree integrates) predicative and\nmethodological reliability, the Daubert factors that measure methodological reliability are sometimes\na component of a legal-sufficiency challenge. In short, we have demonstrated that a litigator must\n [*291] endeavor to understand the three reliability gates and the distinctions between them to ensure\nthat each is satisfied, to determine how and when to preserve objections based on each, and to\nanticipate and protect against postverdict attacks on the reliability of expert testimony. Yet we have also\ndemonstrated that these concepts are quite difficult to understand, for courts as well as practitioners.\nWe offer the following ″lessons″ and ″tips″ in an effort to alleviate some of this burden.\n\nThe key lessons that parties offering and opposing expert testimony should take away from this Article\nare (1) in Texas, expert opinions are subject to both admissibility and legal-sufficiency challenges\nbased on reliability; 1772 (2) causation opinions are subject to particularly exacting scrutiny; 1773 (3) it\nis the basis of an expert’s opinion, not his qualifications to offer an opinion, that gives the opinion\n1769\n       Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins, 47 S.W.3d 486 (Tex. 2001). For a further discussion of Helena Chem., see supra notes 1671-77\nand accompanying text.\n1770\n       Helena Chem., 47 S.W.3d at 500.\n1771\n       Id. at 501.\n1772\n       See supra Part III.A.\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 224 of 230\n                                                       52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *291\n\nprobative value; 1774 (4) an expert must identify the basis or predicate for his opinion, and if the expert\nfails to do so, or if the predicate identified is not reliable or does not support the expert’s opinion, the\nexpert’s opinion is likewise not reliable; 1775 (5) reliability is not correctness - an opinion that is the\nproduct of an unreliable methodology is not reliable even if it happens to be correct, and conflicting\nopinions that result from different but reliable methodologies may both be reliable even if one is\nnecessarily incorrect; 1776 and (6) when an expert opinion is founded in part on reasoning and analysis,\na meaningful ″analytical gap″ in the expert’s logic renders the opinion unreliable. 1777\n\nConnective reliability is perhaps the most important reliability gate because it links - and to a degree,\nsubsumes - both predicative and methodological reliability. It requires experts to explain their\nreasoning and thus show how they bridge [*292] any gap between the predicative data or methodology\nthey rely on and their conclusions. In short, experts must be transparent and show their work, much\nlike high school math teachers require for problem solving on tests. Thus, to ensure that their\nconclusions are not deemed conclusory and pass the connective reliability gate, experts should (1)\nmake plain the information they considered and why that information was appropriate to consider; (2)\nexplain how they used the information; and (3) explain why their use of information leads to their\nconclusion. This explanatory process must be used for each of the experts’ opinions. By doing so, a\nparty can avoid the following five traps.\n\nFirst, unreliable expert testimony may prove fatal to a claim or affirmative defense even when a party\nprevails with the factfinder. An appellate court may consider a properly preserved preverdict objection\nto the reliability of expert testimony as part of a challenge to the trial court’s decision to admit that\nevidence, and an appellate court may consider a challenge to reliability that was raised for the first time\npostverdict as a legal-sufficiency challenge. When expert testimony is necessary to prove a claim or\naffirmative defense 1778 and the expert testimony is unreliable, there will be no evidence to support the\nverdict. Thus, a party must consider not only whether the expert’s testimony will pass the reliability\ngate at trial, but also on appeal.\n\nSecond, a preverdict objection is properly preserved if it challenges all three parts of the reliability\ninquiry. If the preverdict objection does not challenge the methodology of the opinion, that challenge\nmay not be raised as part of a legal-sufficiency challenge to the evidence that is based on\nmethodological flaws by the expert unless (1) the methodological flaws are apparent from the record;\n1773\n       Specifically, expert testimony on the ″causation″ element of a claim is subject to a particular set of rules and standards. Under\nRobinson, an expert causation opinion is not reliable, and therefore not admissible, if the expert fails to rule out other plausible causes;\nunder Merrell, an expert causation opinion is conclusory, and therefore not probative evidence, if the expert fails to rule out other\nplausible causes. See supra notes 370, 393, 1196, 1532 and accompanying text.\n1774\n        See, e.g., Hous. Unlimited, Inc. Metal Processing v. Mel Acres Ranch, No. 13-0084, 2014 WL 4116810, at 15 (Tex. Aug. 22,\n2014). However, as discussed above, an expert’s qualifications and experience sometimes form part of the basis for his opinion. See supra\nPart III.B.2.c.i.\n1775\n       See supra Part III.A.2.e.\n1776\n       See supra notes 251, 1375 and accompanying text; see also supra note 34.

L. Rev. 1, *292\n\n1779\n     or (2) the flaws are incorporated into a broader argument that the opinion is conclusory or contains\nan analytical gap, as discussed below. Coastal Transport states such challenges are waived unless the\nflaw is apparent from the face of the record. 1780 But other cases [*293] suggest they are not. 1781 The\nCoastal Transport Court’s reference to ″underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data″\ncould be a reference to the methodology, techniques, or foundation used in studies or data collections\nrelied upon by an expert rather than the expert’s own methodology.\n\nRamirez, Pollock, Whirlpool, and Merrell indicate that methodological and foundational challenges\nthat are determinable on the face of the record may be raised for the first time postverdict as\n″conclusory″ or ″speculative.″ For example, the Court in Ramirez discussed a Daubert factor - the\nabsence of testing - in support of its holding that the testimony was conclusory. 1782 Likewise, the\nCourt in Whirlpool relied on the absence of testing and evidence satisfying some of the other Daubert\nfactors in holding that an expert’s opinion was conclusory. And a number of courts have found that\nwhen an expert relies on literature or other foundational data and that literature or data is not in the\nrecord, the opinion is unreliable. 1783 It is but a short step when the supporting data are missing from\nthe record to conclude that not only is the opinion [*294] unreliable but that it is conclusory because\nthe factfinder and appellate court are only provided with the ipse dixit of the expert. Thus, careful\nwitness preparation and presentation should also proceed as if not only have analytical gap and\nconclusory objections been made, but also methodological and predicate reliability objections.\n\n1779\n       See supra notes 264-69 and accompanying text (discussing Coastal Transport).\n1780\n        Coastal Transp. Co. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 233 (Tex. 2004) (″When the testimony is challenged as\nconclusory or speculative and therefore non-probative on its face, however, there is no need to go beyond the face of the record to test\nits reliability. We therefore conclude that when a reliability challenge requires the court to evaluate the underlying methodology,\ntechnique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made so that the trial court has the opportunity to conduct\nthis analysis. However, when the challenge is restricted to the face of the record[- ]for example, when expert testimony is speculative\nor conclusory on its face[- ] then a party may challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence even in the absence of any objection to its\nadmissibility.″); see also supra notes 264-69 and accompanying text (discussing Coastal Transport).\n1781\n        See, e.g., Merck & Co. v.

An expert’s opinion might be unreliable, for\nexample, if it is based on assumed facts that vary from the actual facts, or it might be conclusory because it is based on tests or data\nthat do not support the conclusions reached.

L. Rev. 1, *294\n\nIn neither Ramirez nor Whirlpool was it necessary for the Court to treat the opinions as conclusory\nbecause neither involved a preservation of error problem due to timely objections at trial. 1784 The\nCourt’s label of these opinions as conclusory nevertheless identifies arguments that should be raised\nwhen there is no trial objection. And to do so is not far from agreeing with the appellant’s original\nsuggestion in Maritime Overseas - which the Court rejected - that the standards ″articulated in\nRobinson and Havner are the proper standards for reviewing the [legal] sufficiency″ of expert\ntestimony. 1785 It is also worth noting that the only Justice left from the Maritime Overseas Court is\nthen-Justice Hecht, who dissented on this issue.\n\nThird, a party may raise a conclusory objection for the first time postverdict as part of a\nlegal-sufficiency challenge. 1786 In determining the amount of detail to present to a jury about the basis\nfor an expert’s opinion, a party has to balance the benefits of a fulsome explanation that will protect\nit in the event of a posttrial motion or appeal against the risk of alienating the jury by presenting too\nmuch detail. If the party loses the jury, all the legal niceties about protecting the record become\nacademic. But [*295] the lesson from Texas appellate decisions is that a party who proceeds with\nminimal detail in the absence of an objection does so at its peril. In short, when making this balance,\na party must therefore proceed as if the other party has made an objection that the evidence is\nconclusory, speculative and unreliable because the expert fails to provide a predicate for her opinion,\nbecause the expert provides a predicate for his opinion but the predicate provided does not actually\nsupport the opinion, or because the process by which the expert reasoned from his predicate to her\nopinion about the facts of the case leaves too great an analytical gap. And a preverdict objection to the\nlack of a supportive predicate or to the existence of an analytical gap is not necessary to preserve error\nfor a legal-sufficiency challenge based on these defects. The burden, therefore, falls on the proponent\nof the expert opinion to identify the potential gaps as part of witness preparation by carefully\nexamining the underlying methodology and predicate data and the links necessary to reach the expert’s\nconclusion and then plugging those gaps during the expert’s testimony.\n\nCareful witness preparation will identify some opinions as conclusory with little effort. For example,\nan expert’s use of words and phrases from a jury charge will not, without more, constitute evidence.\n\n1784\n        To be clear, there were two experts whose testimony was challenged in Ramirez. Volkswagen argued that both experts’ testimony\nwas unreliable and no evidence to support the jury verdict of a defect in the vehicle. For the first expert, Ronald Walker, the Court relied\non both the Daubert factors and the Gammill test to hold that his opinion was solely ″his subjective interpretation of the facts,″\n″unreliable,″ and ″no evidence.″ Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 906. For the second expert, Edward Cox, the dissent argued that the legal\nsufficiency of his testimony was not presented as an issue to the Court. Id. at 909. Volkswagen did not dispute in the Supreme Court -\nas it did in the trial court and court of appeals - that his testimony was unreliable but it did contend that it was no evidence to support\nthe defect finding. Id. at 902-03. The dissent argued that Volkswagen could not contest the reliability of Cox’s testimony in its no\nevidence challenge in the Supreme Court. ″No evidence challenges to conclusory or speculative testimony that is non-probative on its\nface″ could be raised at any time, while ″no evidence challenges to the reliability of expert testimony in which we evaluate the underlying\nmethodology, technique or foundational data used by the expert″ must be preserved.

L. Rev. 1, *295\n\n1787\n      Similarly, when an expert offers no support for an opinion, it is conclusory. 1788 But in some cases\nit is more difficult to determine if an opinion is conclusory. Arkoma Basin is the only explicit definition\nof when a statement is conclusory by the Texas Supreme Court; it narrowly defines a conclusory\nstatement as one that is essentially a ″conclusion without any explanation.″ 1789 Two courts of appeals\nhave given [*296] similar narrow definitions in other contexts. One defined it as a statement that\n″expresses subjective belief and gives no factual support for that belief.″ 1790 Another defined it as a\nstatement ″that does not provide the underlying facts to support the conclusion.″ 1791\nDespite these narrow definitions, the Texas Supreme Court treats an expert opinion as conclusory when\nan explanation is given but leaves an analytical gap. Ramirez imports the ″analytical gap″ test into the\nanalysis of whether expert testimony is conclusory and whether a trial objection is necessary. And the\nCourt went further in Pollock when it held that even when some explanation is offered for an opinion,\nif that explanation ″does not, on its face, support the opinion, the opinion is still conclusory.″ 1792\nPollock treated expert testimony as conclusory when the stated basis does not in fact support the\nopinion. Pollock may represent the high water mark for how forgiving the Court will be when an expert\nopinion has a stated basis that is part of the record - there, studies - but the stated basis does not in fact\nsupport the expert’s conclusion. And arguably Pollock could be limited to a case where a party at least\nobjects that the evidence is conclusory before the close of the evidence. While that objection is not\nnormally needed for a legal-sufficiency review of evidence, it arguably could be required because Rule\n705(a) of the Texas Rules of Evidence allows an expert to present an opinion without stating its basis\n″unless the court requires otherwise.″ 1793 Such a requirement arguably would reconcile the tension\nbetween Arkoma Basin and Pollock.\nFourth, as discussed above under the predicative-reliability gate, a preverdict objection is not necessary\nwhen an expert’s opinion is based on facts that are contrary to the undisputed evidence. 1794\nNonetheless, it is also helpful to think of this as a [*297] lack of connective reliability; the disconnect\n1787\n       See Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez, 204 S.W.3d 797, 805-06 (Tex. 2006) (stating that expert ″did little more than throw\nout terms″ that were in dispute in tire manufacturing defect claim ″when stating, in conclusory fashion, that the belt separation must have\noriginated at the plant.″); W.C.

For example, the San Antonio Court of Appeals recently stated in\na condemnation case,\n\nProffered expert testimony is nothing more than an opinion, and does not rise to the level of evidence\nunless it passes muster under the Rules of Evidence… . Therefore, if the only ″evidence″ supporting\nan issue is unreliable expert testimony, then it is really ″no evidence,″ and the challenging party is\nentitled to judgment. 1796\n\nCoastal Transport, however, requires reliability challenges to the expert’s underlying methodology and\nfoundational data to be made in the trial court first before an appellant may argue that these reliability\ndefects make the expert’s opinion no evidence. But as discussed above, there remain two large\nexceptions that threaten to swallow this rule: (1) if the flaw is apparent from the face of the record; and\n(2) the flaws in the methodology or foundational data support a holding that the opinion was\nconclusory. 1797\n\nFifth, in the context of expert testimony on causation, a failure to rule out other potential causes may\nrender an opinion conclusory and speculative, and therefore can be raised for the first time postverdict.\n1798\n     Again, the lawyer must proceed as if [*298] this objection has been made before concluding his\npresentation of the expert.

Plea to Jur. Again, the definition for recklessness as stated before is “an\n\nact that the operator knew or should have known posed a high degree of risk of serious\n\ninjury.” See, City of Amarillo v. Martin, 971 S.W.2d 426, 429–30 (Tex. 1998) (Emphasis\n\nAdded) This opinion is irrelevant because it has no bearing as to what knowledge County\n\nDeputy Ortega or any other Hidalgo County employee had that would have made any of their\n\nactions reckless. Accordingly, opinion No.8 fails to provide admissible evidence. Further,\n\nsuch opinion is clearly irrelevant to such issue.\n\n                                  Reliability of Report as a Whole\n\n3.15      Even if this Court finds that Plaintiffs’ expert is qualified to give such opinions, AND\n\nsuch opinions are relevant, the report as a whole is unreliable. As stated by the First Court of\n\nAppeals:\n\n     “a court cannot simply accept expert testimony at face-value because unreliable expert\n\n     testimony constitutes no evidence.         The trial court should undertake a rigorous\n\n     examination of the three components of the reliability inquiry, namely, the expert's\n\n     methodology, foundational data, and whether too great an analytical gap exists as the\n\n     expert connects the foundational data or methodology with the opinion. Each material\n\n     part of an expert's theory must be reliable. Stated differently, the expert's testimony must\n\n     be reliable at each and every step or else it is inadmissible.”\n\nWilson v.

See, Earle v. Ratliff, 998\n\nS.W.2d 882, 890 (Tex. 1999). In other words, just because the expert says it, doesn’t make it so,\n\nthere has to be a scientific explanation based on facts. Expert opinions must be supported by\n\nfacts in evidence, not conjecture. See, Marathon Corp. v. Pitzner, 106 S.W.3d 724, 729 (Tex.\n\n2003) (per curiam).\n\n3.17      Analytical Gap: Weinblatt states in the very first page of his report “...I have examined\n\nthe following documents that you provided in order to facilitate the preparation of this Expert\n\nOpinion document:” See, Exhibit B to Plaintiffs Response to HC’s 1st & 2nd Amend. Plea to Jur.\n\nHe then enumerates 30 documents. Id. In the subject report it is evident that Dr. Weinblatt\n\nrarely references such enumerated documents. Id. The reader has to take Weinblatt at his word\n\nthat the facts necessary to support his opinions and conclusions are in the enumerated\n\ndocuments. In essence, Weinblatt fails to offer the necessary evidentiary basis for each opinion.\n\n3.18      Vagueness: It is impossible to make out what alleged actions he attributes to other\n\nagencies, (e.g. Pharr police, DPS) and which allegations he attributes to any Hidalgo County\n\nemployee, including Sr. Deputy Ortega. For example Weinblatt almost never specifies “Hidalgo\n\nCounty” or “Deputy Ortega” he just makes vague assertions.\n\n3.19      Such analytical gap and vagueness in Weinblatt’s report fails to establish its admissibility\n\nbecause the whole report is unreliable. Weinblatt has not met his burden of showing a link\n\nbetween his opinions and the facts.\n\n                                      Helpfulness of the Report\n\n3.20      While we believe it extremely unlikely the Court should reach the second step in the\n\ngatekeeping process, (should this Court find that Weinblatt’s report is properly verified, and that\n\n\n\nHid Co.: Mot.to Excl.

Pharr and County units\n                                   were not involved in or nearby at the time of the\n                                   collision. This is an interlocutory appeal of the\n                                   denial of a Plea to the Jurisdiction filed by Hidalgo\n                                   County as a governmental entity. The legal question\n                                   at issue is whether Hidalgo County retains\n                                   governmental immunity from Plaintiffs’ claims for\n                                   personal injuries and wrongful death. Defendant\n                                   Hidalgo County contends that Plaintiffs have not\n                                   pleaded and have not filed competent prima facie\n                                   evidence of a claim which overcomes governmental\n                                   immunity or which fits within a waiver exception\n                                   thereto. In short, the trial Court has no jurisdiction\n                                   over Plaintiffs’ claim, as pleaded and proved herein.\n\nCourse of Proceedings:             Plaintiffs filed suit against Hidalgo County, Texas\n                                   and other governmental entities on May 23, 2012.\n                                   1CR201.

On\n                             September 26, 2013, the Court heard Defendant\n                             County’s Second amended Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n                             2RR1.

On May 20, 2014,\n                             Plaintiffs filed a Response to Defendant County’s\n                             Motion to Exclude. 1CR285. On May 21, 2014,\n                             Hidalgo County filed an First Amended Reply to\n                             Plaintiffs’ Response to Its First And Second\n                             Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction. 1CR371. On May\n                             21, 2014, the Court heard Defendant County’s\n                             Second Amended Plea to the Jurisdiction and its\n                             Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs’ Expert Report. 3RR1.\n                             Thereafter, on the same date, Defendant County\n                             filed a Letter Brief to the Court. 1CR377. On\n                             March 13, 2015, the Court denied Defendant\n                             County’s First and Second Amended Plea to the\n                             Jurisdiction. 1CR405.

The trial\n                             court has never ruled on Defendant County’s\n                             Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs’ Expert Report.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xi\n\f                       STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n      Defendant Hidalgo County challenges the jurisdiction of the trial court as set\n\nout herein. This court has appellate jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n\n§51.014(a)(8) Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code, which allows interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom the denial of a plea to the jurisdiction by a governmental unit.\n\n              STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Appellants request oral argument in order to elaborate on the issues\n\npresented and answer questions of the Court, based on the complexity of the facts.\n\nThe record is somewhat complicated and oral argument would assist the Court in\n\nfocusing on the facts and relevant issues.\n\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    The Trial Court Erred in Denying Defendant Hidalgo County’s Plea to\n      the Jurisdiction because Plaintiffs Have Neither Alleged Nor Proven\n      and Cannot Allege or Prove an Affirmative Waiver of Hidalgo\n      County’s Sovereign Immunity.\n\n2.    Hidalgo County is Not Liable Because Deputy Ortega Did Not Breach\n      the Emergency Standard of Care.\n\n3.    Hidalgo County Is Not Liable Because Deputy Ortega Was Acting\n      Within the Scope of His Authority and In Good Faith.\n\n4.    The Report of \"Expert\" Weinblatt Is Not Based Upon a Reliable\n      Foundation  and   Must   Be    Regarded    as  No   Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f                                STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a negligence action under the Texas Tort Claims Act2 against\n\nHidalgo County, Texas (and other law enforcement agencies), alleging damages\n\narising from a fatal collision between vehicles being driven by Rafael Carro\n\nQuintero and Plaintiffs’ deceased family member, Reynaldo Herrera. 1CR137-141,\n\n143-147. Quintero was the driver of a black Ford Expedition who was fleeing\n\nfrom a pursuit through multiple jurisdictions initiated by a City of Pharr Police\n\nOfficer. CR139.\n\n       At approximately 6:00 p.m. on May 26, 2010, City of Pharr Police Officer\n\nEmilio Gonzalez had attempted to stop the black Expedition being driven by\n\nQuintero on a traffic violation. 1CR138. Officer Gonzalez reported to his\n\ndispatcher that the vehicle had come out of a high drug traffic area, but did not tell\n\nhis dispatcher that he was pursuing the vehicle because of a window tint violation.\n\n1CR138; 2CR43, 45. At a high rate of speed, Quintero fled from Officer Gonzalez,\n\nwho pursued him eastbound on Military Road and through the City of Alamo.\n\n1CR139. During the pursuit, Officer Gonzalez radioed for assistance from other\n\nlaw enforcement agencies, including the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Department.\n\n1CR139, 140.\n\n2\n  Plaintiffs erroneously plead that their causes of action arise under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n101.102. 1CR137. This Section of the Tort Claims Act only sets out the pleading and service\nrequirements for the commencement of a suit.\n\n                                                 1\n\f      At approximately 6:16 p.m., Hidalgo County Senior Deputy John Ortega\n\nwas parked west of the intersection of Tower and Canton Roads in Edinburg,\n\nHidalgo County. He heard the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office communications\n\ndispatcher radio that Pharr Police Department was in pursuit of a black Ford\n\nExpedition travelling northbound from F.M. 495 on Tower Road and that it was\n\npossibly transporting narcotics. 1CR85; App.Tab.5. Sgt. Miguel Davila of Hidalgo\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Office also heard the Sheriff’s Office dispatcher relay the City of\n\nPharr request for assistance and that the vehicle was transporting narcotics. 1CR95.\n\nDeputy Ortega then repositioned and parked his unit facing south, on Tower Road\n\nsouth of Canton Road. He observed that at a distance south on Tower Road, red\n\nand blue emergency lights and wig wags of the vehicles involved in the pursuit\n\nwere visible. 1CR85; App.Tab.5. He then observed the black Expedition with\n\nMexico license plates traveling north on Tower Road at a very high rate of speed.\n\n1CR85-86; App.Tab.5. He activated his own emergency lights and siren to identify\n\nhimself to the fleeing vehicle as a Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office unit and\n\nSheriff’s deputy. The fleeing vehicle continued past him, traveling north at a very\n\nhigh rate of speed. 1CR86; App. Tab.5. Sometime thereafter, Pharr Police Officer\n\nGonzalez disengaged the pursuit at the intersection of Tower and Trenton Roads,\n\nbut failed to radio to advise other agencies to disengage. 1CR140, 1CR96;\n\nApp.Tab.7.\n\n\n                                         2\n\fAfter making a u-turn at Canton Road, Deputy Ortega observed the fleeing vehicle\n\nalready passing Iowa Road, one half-mile north of Canton Road. 1CR85-86;\n\n1CR88; App.Tab.5.      By the time Deputy Ortega reached Iowa Road, the\n\nExpedition had turned westbound onto Curve Road, 7/10ths of a mile north of\n\nDeputy Ortega’s location. 1CR86; App.Tab.5; 1CR89; App.Tab.6. When Deputy\n\nOrtega reached the intersection of Tower Road and Curve Road he made a\n\ncomplete stop. He then turned and headed west towards Alamo Road; he had no\n\nsight of the vehicle but followed a cloud of dust. 1CR86; App.Tab.5. Curve Road\n\nis a dirt road. 1CR96 App.Tab.7. Concerned that the dust prevented him from\n\nbeing able to see oncoming traffic and because of the rough road surface and\n\npotholes, Deputy Ortega drove slowly from Tower Road to Alamo Road on Curve\n\nRoad.   Demonstrating a further concern for the safety of others, he made a\n\ncomplete stop where Curve Road intersects with Alamo Road to observe north and\n\nsouth bound traffic. There, he observed a white Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office\n\nExpedition approach from the south. 1CR86; App.Tab.5. As Deputy Javier Lopez\n\n(in the white Expedition) drove north on Alamo Road, he had heard Deputy Ortega\n\nreport that the black Expedition was traveling toward Alamo Road on Curve Road.\n\n1CR96; App.Tab.7. As he drove toward the intersection of Curve Road and Alamo\n\nRoad, Deputy Lopez did not see the black Expedition cross the intersection, but\n\nsaw a dust cloud at the intersection. Then, Deputy Lopez observed Deputy Ortega\n\n\n                                       3\n\fcautiously cross Alamo Road. 1CR96; App.Tab.7. 2CR J. Lopez Video at 2:01.\n\nAfter crossing the intersection, Deputy Ortega continued to travel westbound on\n\nCurve Road and Deputy Javier Lopez turned onto Curve Road and followed him.\n\n1CR86; App.Tab.5. 2CR J. Lopez Video at 2:01. Neither Deputy Ortega nor\n\nDeputy Lopez had sight of the black Expedition as they proceeded west on Curve\n\nRoad until they arrived at the intersection of Curve Road and Cesar Chavez Road\n\nand saw that it had been involved in a major traffic accident. 1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\nThe two Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office units driven by Deputy Ortega and\n\nDeputy Lopez arrived at the scene of the collision two to three minutes after it\n\noccurred. 1CR98; App.Tab.9; 1CR102-103; App.Tab.8; 1CR267-272; App.Tabs.8,\n\n9.\n\n      Thus, Deputy Ortega was not directly engaged in the vehicle pursuit after he\n\nlost sight of the black Expedition when it turned onto Curve Road. 1CR96. When\n\nSgt. Miguel Davila, Deputy Ortega’s supervisor reviewed Deputy Ortega’s\n\ndashcam video he determined that it had not recorded any data that day. The last\n\nrecorded data was the evening before on May 25, 2010 at 8:53 p.m. 1CR96;\n\nApp.Tab.7.\n\n      The driver of the fleeing black Expedition was transporting persons who had\n\ncrossed the river from Mexico into the United States that afternoon. 1CR91;\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\fApp.Tab. 11. Following the collision several persons ran from the black\n\nExpedition. Six persons were detained following the collision. 1CR95; App.Tab.7.\n\n      The front seat passenger being transported in the black Expedition stated that\n\nafter the vehicle entered the dirt road, she could no longer see police lights or hear\n\nsirens. 1CR91; App.Tab 11. A passenger in the middle of the second row of seats\n\n(who had been told to keep his head down) stated that sometime prior to the\n\ncollision he could no longer hear the sirens. 1CR92; App.Tab.12.\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Plaintiffs have not as a matter of law pleaded a cause of action in this case or\n\npresented evidence which overcomes Hidalgo County’s sovereign immunity under\n\nthe Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code 101.021(2), because\n\nthere is no use of a motor vehicle by Hidalgo County that caused the collision\n\nbetween the third party and the Plaintiff’s vehicle in this case. The only evidence\n\non the issue of causation is that the County vehicle was 2-3 minutes away when the\n\ncollision occurred and was not within sight or hearing. Accordingly, there was\n\nsuch a physical and temporal separation between the County vehicle and the\n\ncollision in question, that no causal nexus exists as a matter of law.\n\n      Further, the County Deputy involved was acting under an “emergency” and\n\nclearly did not breach the standard applicable to such situation; he was not\n\nreckless; and the only evidence of his conduct demonstrates care and caution, as\n\n\n                                           5\n\fopposed to the “conscious indifference” and “reckless disregard” required for\n\nliability under the law.\n\n      Additionally, Deputy Ortega was acting in good faith, within the scope of\n\nhis authority, and was acting well within his discretionary immunity at all times.\n\n      No competent evidence exists that no reasonably prudent officer under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances could have believed that Deputy Ortega should have\n\nresponded differently and should not have followed the fleeing suspect in the\n\nmanner in which he did. The only evidence offered by the Plaintiffs is that of the\n\npolice procedure “expert” who is not qualified to render opinions on causation or\n\naccident reconstruction, and whose opinions relative to Deputy Ortega are\n\nconclusory, unreliable and unsupported by a factual foundation.\n\n      Consequently, the trial court erred in its denial of the Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\nand the case should be reversed and rendered in favor of Hidalgo County.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\n1.

The\n\nExpedition passed him and he saw the collision in his rear view mirror. He stopped\n\nhis vehicle and got off. About three minutes later he saw the Hidalgo County\n\nSheriff’s Office patrol units approaching the intersection, driving westbound on\n\nCurve Road. 1CR102-103; 1CR270-272; App.Tab.8.\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f      Sergio Veliz’s brother, Armando Veliz states that he was in his shop at the\n\ncorner of Curve and Cesar Chavez Roads, when he heard a loud noise.

He saw five men and one woman get out of the Expedition and that two of\n\nthe men from the Expedition had been ejected. One of the men tried getting into\n\nhis house, but his wife closed the door.

Ms Veliz states that she was at home at 4210\n\nCurve Road, Edinburg, Texas on the computer when she heard a loud noise\n\noutside. She and her son ran out through the front door and noticed a maroon car\n\nwith a man hanging out of the door. She remembers saying “Someone call 9-1-1.”\n\nShe then noticed that her daughter was outside and told her daughter to go inside\n\nand call 9-1-1. Ms. Veliz went back inside the house with her daughter to look for\n\nthe phone, but they were unable to find it. Ms. Veliz decided to go to her ex-\n\nhusband’s machine shop behind the house to use the phone. However, when she\n\nopened her back door she found an injured man on her doorstep asking to come in.\n\nShe tried to close the door on him and he pushed back, trying to get in. She pushed\n\n\n                                         15\n\fagainst him and was able to close and lock the door. She went back out through\n\nthe front door and was walking around the side of her house, when she saw the\n\nsame man lying on the ground. At that time, she noticed that “several cop cars” had\n\narrived and a law enforcement officer was standing next to the man on the ground.\n\n1CR104-105. App.Tab.10.        Had the vehicles driven by the Hidalgo County\n\ndeputies been visible or within audible range when Ms. Veliz first went outside,\n\nshe would not have felt a need to tell anyone to call 9-1-1. Ms. Veliz’s affidavit\n\nconfirms the reasonableness of her husband’s and brother-in-law’s estimates that\n\nthe Hidalgo County deputies arrived at the scene of the crash about two to three\n\nminutes after the fact.\n\n      The physical and temporal separation between the fleeing vehicle and\n\nDeputy Ortega’s unit in this case is further supported by the statements of two of\n\nthe immigrants who were being transported in the black Expedition, as taken by\n\nthe investigating agency, Texas Department of Public Safety. Claudia Janeth\n\nValdez Villarreal, who had been seated in the front passenger seat, described the\n\npursuit initiated by the City of Pharr police officer and stated that after the driver\n\ncrossed onto a dirt road and there was a lot of dust, he seemed to lose the police\n\nofficer. She no longer saw the police lights or [heard] the siren. Shortly after that\n\nshe saw a stop sign, the driver slowed, but continued through the intersection and\n\ncrashed into another vehicle.       1CR91. App.Tab.11. Ms. Valdez’s brother,\n\n\n                                         16\n\fFrancisco Javier Valdez Villarreal was in the middle of the second row of seats. He\n\nhad been told to keep his head down. He could hear the police sirens behind them.\n\nHe stated that they were chased by the police for what seemed like thirty minutes,\n\nthen he didn’t hear the police any more, but the driver continued to drive fast. He\n\nheard someone in the vehicle yell at the driver to let [the passengers] out, but the\n\ndriver did not respond. Shortly after that Mr. Valdez heard the screeching of tires\n\nand they crashed with another vehicle. 1CR92; App.Tab.12 [emphasis added].\n\n      Even if the Veliz brothers’ estimates of the Sheriff’s Office units arriving\n\ntwo to three minutes after the collision are slightly overestimated, it is clear that\n\nsufficient time had passed between the collision and the arrival of the Hidalgo\n\nCounty deputies to establish a physical and temporal separation sufficient to\n\nsupport a lack of causal nexus as applied by our Texas courts, particularly as\n\napplied in Hillis and Teague.\n\n      It is undisputed that the vehicle which collided with the car driven by the\n\ndecedent, Reynaldo Herrera was the black Expedition driven by Quintero, which\n\nwas the subject of the pursuit initiated by the City of Pharr, Texas. It is also\n\nundisputed that no deputy from Hidalgo County collided with Mr. Herrera’s\n\nvehicle. 1CR138-139; 1CR85-87; App.Tab.5; 1CR115-116.              Neither did any\n\nHidalgo County deputy “physically force” Quintero’s vehicle “off the road or into\n\nanother vehicle or object.” Deputy Ortega was thrust into a situation over which\n\n\n                                         17\n\fhe had no control when Quintero’s vehicle entered his jurisdiction at a high rate of\n\nspeed and blew past him. By the time Deputy Ortega became involved, events had\n\nalready been long set in motion. Even when the occupants of Quintero’s vehicle\n\nbelieved that the police were no longer pursuing and begged Quintero to stop and\n\nlet them out, Quintero chose to speed on toward the intersection of Curve and\n\nCesar Chavez Roads and into the path of Reynaldo Herrera’s vehicle. Quintero’s\n\nactions were the sole cause of Reynaldo Herrera’s death. Plaintiffs have offered no\n\ncontradictory evidence.\n\n      Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not established and cannot establish the\n\nrequired causal nexus between the death of Reynaldo Herrera and the actions of\n\nany Hidalgo County deputy and cannot defeat Hidalgo County’s sovereign\n\nimmunity.    Therefore, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs claims for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n      In the case at hand, Plaintiffs’ reliance on the plurality opinion in Travis v.\n\nCity of Mesquite, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1766914\"><a href=\"/opinion/1766914/travis-v-city-of-mesquite/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1992) is misguided. In Travis two off-duty\n\npolice officers pursued a fleeing suspect vehicle down a one-way highway access\n\nroad. The fleeing driver then crashed head on into another vehicle killing one\n\nperson and injuring others. Analyzing causation, the Travis court held that “[t]here\n\nwas summary judgment evidence that the conduct of the police officers was a\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fcause in fact of the accident in question, and of the injuries for which the plaintiffs\n\nseek recovery.” Id., at 98.\n\n      Like Plaintiffs herein, the Hillis plaintiffs relied on the holdings of the Travis\n\ncourt. Hillis, 308 S.W.3d at 535. However, the Hillis court found Travis to be\n\ndistinguishable, because “the defendants in Travis did not argue immunity as a\n\ndefense because the Travis court analyzed the case only as a general proximate-\n\ncause case, not an immunity case.” Travis, at 99; Hillis, at 535 [emphasis added].\n\n“Thus, the Travis court considered only the broad question of whether general\n\npolice negligence caused the accident in question; it did not consider the narrower\n\nissue of whether the use of a police car was the actual cause of the accident in\n\nquestion. By contrast, this case squarely presents the question of what constitutes a\n\nsufficient causal nexus between the use of a police vehicle and a subsequent\n\naccident.” Hillis, at 535.\n\n      Like the City of Dallas in Hillis, Hidalgo County appeals the denial of its\n\nplea to the jurisdiction. This case presents the same question— what constitutes a\n\nsufficient causal nexus between the use of a police vehicle and a subsequent\n\naccident—as does Hillis. When the Hillis causal nexus analysis is applied to the\n\nfacts of this case, it is clear that Plaintiffs’ claims do not arise out of Hidalgo\n\nCounty’s use of a Sheriff’s department vehicle and thus Hidalgo County’s\n\nimmunity has not been waived.\n\n\n                                          19\n\f2.

He could only see a cloud of dust. 1CR86;\n\n   App.Tab.5.\n\n At the intersection of Curve Road and Alamo Road, he observed a white\n\n   Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office Expedition approach from the south.\n\n   1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\n He had no sight of the black Expedition as he proceeded west on Curve\n\n   Road until he arrived at the intersection of Curve Road and Cesar Chavez\n\n   Road and saw that it had been involved in a major traffic accident.\n\n   1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\n After the suspect turned onto Curve Road, Deputy Ortega was not even\n\n   engaged in the pursuit, because he had no “visual” on the black\n\n   Expedition. 1CR96; App.Tab7.\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\f      Plaintiffs’ allegations against Hidalgo County are based on the assumption\n\nthe Deputy Ortega was engaged in the pursuit and the common theme that Deputy\n\nOrtega should not have engaged in the “pursuit”; that it was reckless and\n\ndangerous to do so. For example, they allege that a reasonably prudent officer\n\nshould appreciate that a “prolonged pursuit … through residential neighborhoods\n\n… with many near crashes” should have been discontinued immediately (1CR198).\n\nHowever, they offer no evidence that Deputy Ortega had any knowledge of the\n\nlength and nature of the pursuit prior to his decision to respond to City of Pharr\n\nOfficer Gonzalez’s request for assistance, or during his response.\n\n      Plaintiffs also contend that “it was incumbent upon Sr. Deputy Ortega and\n\nhis supervisors to understand the justification for the chase and ask if the\n\njustification was absent or murky.” 1CR196. Plaintiffs conclude that Deputy\n\nOrtega “evidences a lack of good faith for initiating, engaging and continuing the\n\npursuit based on weak, legally faulty, or non-existent justification for the pursuit.”\n\n1CR196. Plaintiffs further conclude that “[b]ased upon the weak reasoning behind\n\nOfficer Gonzalez’ initiation of the pursuit, the assisting agencies should not have\n\ncommenced, continued, or assisted in the chase and doing so constituted a\n\nconscious disregard for public safety.” 1CR198. Plaintiffs offer no evidence that\n\nDeputy Ortega, or his supervisors, or any other Hidalgo County Deputy, knew that\n\nthe City of Pharr pursuit originated from a traffic stop based on a window tint\n\n\n                                         24\n\fviolation. Deputy Ortega’s affidavit makes it clear that he understood that the\n\nreason for the City of Pharr pursuit was because the vehicle was suspected of\n\ntransporting narcotics, as relayed to him by his dispatcher. 1CR85; App.Tab.5.\n\nThis is understandable when you consider that Deputy Gonzalez reported to his\n\ndispatcher that the vehicle had come out of a high drug traffic area, but did not tell\n\nhis dispatcher that he was pursuing the vehicle because of a window tint violation.\n\n1CR138; 2CR43, 45. Deputy Ortega’s affidavit also shows that he knew that the\n\nsuspect vehicle was black, with tinted windows, had Mexican license plates and\n\nwas raveling at a high rate of speed. 1CR85-86; App.Tab.5. Accordingly, in\n\nDeputy Ortega’s mind there was no “absent or murky,” “weak,” “legally faulty,”\n\nor “non-existent” justification for the City of Pharr’s pursuit and Plaintiffs have\n\npresented no evidence to the contrary.\n\n      Further, Deputy Ortega’s affidavit demonstrates how he proceeded to follow\n\nthe black Expedition cautiously with concern for the safety of the public. Despite\n\nthe fact that the fleeing vehicle was traveling at a “high rate of speed,” and was\n\npulling away from him, Ortega “made a complete stop at Curve Road where Tower\n\nRoad continues north towards highway 107 to avoid any incoming traffic\n\ntraveling south on Tower Road.” 1CR86; App.Tab.5. He then “drove slowly from\n\nTower Road on Curve Road towards Alamo Road since [he] no longer had sight of\n\nthe suspect vehicle and Curve Road surface was rough terrain with pot holes and\n\n\n                                         25\n\f[he] could not see the incoming traffic.” 1CR86; App.Tab.5. Upon arriving at\n\nAlamo Road, he “came to a complete stop to observe traffic at the intersection\n\ntraveling north and south.” 1CR86; App.Tab.5.\n\n        In cases involving collisions between emergency vehicles and third parties3\n\nTexas courts have found more direct factual evidence to be insufficient to show\n\nreckless disregard and conscious indifference .

Thus, Deputy Ortega was\n\nperforming a discretionary function as a matter of law.\n\n      Further, despite alleging that Deputy Ortega’s actions (and those of other\n\nHidalgo County Sheriff’s deputies) were ministerial, Plaintiffs’ criticism of Deputy\n\nOrtega is based on alleged discretionary acts, as follows:\n\n      f.     Senior Deputy Ortega evidences a lack of good faith for\n\n             initiating, engaging and continuing the pursuit based on weak,\n\n             faulty or non-existent justification for the pursuit. 1CR145.\n\n             and\n\n      g.     It was the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office’s actions and the\n\n             decision not to get the justification for the pursuit and not to\n\n             engage or terminate quickly who decided to chase and who got\n\n             the momentum going. 1CR145.\n\nPlaintiffs also state that “it is commonly acceptable police standards and practices\n\nthat the danger of the situation should not outweigh the justification for their\n\n\n                                          29\n\finvolvement” and allege that Deputy Ortega made a “willful decision to ignore\n\nthis.” 1CR145. They also allege that Deputy Ortega “involved himself willfully in\n\nthe pursuit in question.” 1CR146.       All of these allegations demonstrate that\n\nPlaintiffs really believe that Deputy Ortega had the discretion to make such\n\ndecisions.\n\n      Additionally, the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Sheriff Job\n\nDescription makes it clear that deputies are expected to perform discretionary\n\nfunctions. For example, under the paragraph entitled “Essential Duties and\n\nResponsibilities” a deputy may perform the duty of responding “to emergency calls\n\nand routine complaints and take action as necessary.” (Emphasis added). 1CR106.\n\nA necessary skill of the job is the “ability to analyze situations and adopt a quick,\n\neffective and reasonable course of action.” 1CR108. Under “Safety Requirement,”\n\na deputy must “maintain mental capacity which permits … making sound decisions\n\nand using good judgment.” 1CR110.\n\n      To establish good faith, Hidalgo County must show that a reasonably\n\nprudent officer in the same or similar situation could have believed that the need\n\nfor officers to respond outweighs the risks associated with the officers' actions.\n\nWadewitz v.

The evidence clearly establishes that Deputy Ortega\n\nbalanced the need for taking the conservative action that he took against any risk to\n\nthe public beyond what already existed and proceeded accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f      The Plaintiffs have not offered, and cannot offer, competent evidence to\n\nshow that no reasonably prudent officer under the same or similar circumstances\n\ncould have believed that Deputy Ortega should have responded differently and\n\nshould not have followed the fleeing suspect in the manner in which he did.\n\nPlaintiffs’ expert, Richard Weinblatt offers no more than conclusory statements\n\nwithout factual basis regarding the good faith actions of Deputy Ortega and\n\nHidalgo County:\n\n      “In my opinion, Officer Gonzales and Sr. Deputy Ortega evidenced a\n\n      lack of good faith for initiating, engaging, and continuing the pursuit\n\n      based on weak, faulty, or non-existent justification for the pursuit …”\n\n      1CR171; 1CR238; App.Tab.17, p.7.\n\nand\n\n      “It is also true that a reasonable and prudent officer should see that a\n\n      prolonged pursuit (including “following”) like this, through residential\n\n      neighborhoods (houses are visible on the sides of the street), with\n\n      many near crashes, should have been discontinued almost\n\n      immediately.”\n\n      1CR180; 1CR247; App.Tab.17, p.16.\n\n      Dr. Weinblatt chooses to ignore that fact that Deputy Ortega understood that\n\nthe basis for the pursuit was because the fleeing vehicle was suspected of\n\n\n                                        32\n\ftransporting narcotics. 1CR85; App.Tab.5. He also fails to consider that Officer\n\nGonzalez did not advise his City of Pharr dispatcher that he initiated the pursuit\n\nbased on a window tint violation and reported to his dispatcher that the vehicle had\n\ncome out of a high drug traffic area. 1CR138; 2CR43, 45. Therefore, there was no\n\n“weak, faulty, or non-existent justification for the pursuit” as Deputy Ortega\n\nunderstood it.\n\n         Further, Dr. Weinblatt, in an all-seeing position of hindsight, after review\n\nseveral dashcam videos from the vehicles of different law enforcement agencies,\n\ndocumenting the pursuit from beginning to end, incorrectly assumes that Deputy\n\nOrtega had knowledge of the duration and nature of the pursuit prior to his\n\ninvolvement.\n\n         Dr. Weinblatt’s conclusory statements are insufficient to support or defeat\n\nsummary judgment. Wadewitz at 466. Therefore, they are not competent evidence\n\nin a Plea to the Jurisdiction and fail to raise a question of fact. Further, Dr.\n\nWeinblatt fails to substantiate his opinion with reference to each aspect of the\n\nChambers balancing test with respect to Deputy Ortega and as required by\n\nChambers and Wadewitz. See Wadewitz, 951 S.W.2d at 467.\n\n         For the above reasons, Deputy Ortega is entitled to official immunity and\n\nHidalgo County’s sovereign immunity remains intact.

The Report of “Expert” Weinblatt Is Not Based Upon a Reliable\n       Foundation and Must Be Regarded as No Evidence, and the Trial Court\n       Erred in Failing to Exclude it from Consideration.\n\n       Not only is the “expert” report full of conclusory and unsupported\n\nstatements, it does not meet the basic reliability requirements of Daubert and its\n\nprogeny.

The trial court also heard arguments at\n\nthe hearing, but did not rule on the record or by signed order regarding the Motion\n\nto Exclude, except by implication when it denied the Plea to the Jurisdiction almost\n\n9 months later. 3RR4,7,8,17-39; 1CR405; App.Tab.1. It was error for the trial\n\ncourt not to exclude such report from consideration, and this Court must review the\n\ndecision (or failure to decide) to exclude the report de novo as a part of its review\n\nof the trial court’s denial of the Plea to Jurisdiction. Such review and consideration\n\nis inherent to any analysis of the basis of such denial.\n\n      Accordingly, County of Hidalgo adopts and re-urges those arguments set out\n\nin the subject motion to exclude, letter brief, and in the transcript of the hearing on\n\nthe motion. App.Tab19,20; 1CR273-284; 1CR377-379; 3RR4,7,8,17-39.\n\n      Dr. Weinblatt provided a resume that may qualify him as an expert on police\n\nprocedure, but it does not qualify him on accident reconstruction or the causation\n\nissues that flow seamlessly through his report.

Further, Weinblatt applies facts he gleans from the dash cam of the\n\nPharr Police officer to the decisions and actions made by the Hidalgo County\n\ndeputy without a basis for such application. Certainly, there is no evidence that the\n\nHidalgo County deputy saw the Pharr Police dash cam and knew that the fleeing\n\nsuspect had been pursued through a high traffic area in Alamo with swerving\n\ncivilian vehicles. App.Tab17,p.3-5; 1CR167-5. There was no dash cam footage\n\nfrom the perspective of Deputy Ortega’s vehicle for Weinblatt to review, as his\n\nreport admits. Id.\n\n      All of this demonstrates that the expert report is incompetent evidence upon\n\nwhich to base a denial of the Plea to the Jurisdiction. As set out in Wadewitz,\n\n             An expert's testimony will support summary judgment only if it is\n      \"clear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions\n      and inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted\" TEX.

Thus,\n      an expert witness's conclusory statement that a reasonable officer could or\n      could not have taken some action will neither establish good faith at the\n      summary judgment stage nor raise a fact issue to defeat summary judgment.\n      Instead, expert testimony on good faith must address what a reasonable\n      officer could have believed under circumstances, see Chambers, 883 S.W.2d\n      at 656-57, and must be substantiated with reference to each aspect of the\n\n\n                                         36\n\f      Chambers balancing test.

It does not address\n\nwhat a reasonable officer could have believed under the circumstances, it relies\n\nupon conclusory statements, and it reaches conclusions about which the expert is\n\nnot qualified, and which are without sound foundation. Accordingly, such report\n\nshould have been excluded from consideration relative to the Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction and should be disregarded by this court in its review of the decision of\n\nthe trial court’s denial of such plea.\n\n                          CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      Because the Plaintiffs cannot establish causation as a matter of law, based\n\nupon the undisputed facts, because such facts do not show any breach of the\n\napplicable “emergency” vehicle standard of care, because the County deputy was\n\nacting in good faith in the scope of his duties, and covered by his discretionary\n\nimmunity, and because the Plaintiffs’ expert was unqualified and his opinions were\n\nunreliable and unsupported by the facts, the trial court erred in denying the Plea to\n\nthe Jurisdiction of Hidalgo County. Each of the four reasons cited would justify a\n\nreversal of such decision. Accordingly, Hidalgo County prays that this court\n\nreverse and render a final judgment of no liability in favor of Hidalgo County and\n\nagainst the plaintiffs on the pleadings, for costs, and for such other and further\n\nrelief to which Hidalgo County is entitled, in law and in equity.\n                                          37\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\n/s/ Preston Henrichson\n\nPreston Henrichson\nState Bar No. 09477000\nLAW OFFICES OF PRESTON HENRICHSON,\nP.C.\n222 W.

The Authors would\nlike to thank Justice Bill Boyce, former Justice Scott Brister, William V. Dorsaneo, III, Steven Goode,\nEdward Imwinkelried, Andy Love, and Reagan Simpson for their comments and insights.\n\n** Attorney, Supreme Court of Texas; former partner at Ware Jackson Lee & Chambers, LLC in\nHouston, Texas; J.D., University of Texas School of Law, 2004; B.S., Texas A&M University, 2001.\nThe opinions in this Article are those of the Authors alone and do not reflect the opinions of the\nSupreme Court of Texas or the First Court of Appeals.\n\nLexisNexis Summary\n\n… The first inquiry is more general in nature - such as examining whether an expert on medical issues\nis a physician - while the second examines whether the expert has ″knowledge, skill, experience,\ntraining, or education regarding the specific issue before the court that would qualify the expert to give\nan opinion on that particular subject. … The Court’s reliance on the Robinson factors to conclude that\nthe expert opinions in Cooper Tire, Mack Trucks, and Whirlpool were ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″\nis somewhat inconsistent with the Court’s statement in Coastal Transport that the ″examination of the\nexpert’s underlying methodology is a task for the trial court in its role as gatekeeper, and is not an\nanalysis that should be undertaken for the first time on appeal.″ … Certainly Professor Goode and his\nco-authors are correct that Havner, Coastal Transport, Whirlpool, and Pollock have changed the\nlandscape of error preservation for expert challenges. … Thus, while the facts or data on which a\ntestifying expert relies in reaching an opinion are not subject to the stricter rules that govern judicial\nadmissibility (e.g., an expert can rely on hearsay or other otherwise inadmissible information ) the\nexpert’s opinion is subject to judicial review for reliability. … Analysis of the first component of\npredicative reliability, predicative soundness, thus may mirror the kind of analysis that takes place at\nthe methodological reliability and connective reliability gates except that, rather than examining the\nmethodology, accuracy, and reasoning of a testifying expert’s own analysis and opinions, the court\nmust examine the methodology, accuracy, and reasoning employed by the experts on whose studies,\narticles, data collections, or conclusions the testifying expert relies. … When science has not yet\ndeveloped direct evidence that a particular substance causes a particular injury, experts in toxic tort\ncases often rely on epidemiological studies and animal studies as indirect evidence of general\n\f                                                                                               Page 2 of 230\n                                            52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *1\n\ncausation. … Texas courts of appeals have reached differing results, for example, with respect to\nwhether Havner requires the exclusion of epidemiological studies that do not show a ″doubling of the\nrisk″ in FELA cases, in which the standard of proof for causation is significantly lower: the claimant\nneed only show that the employer’s negligence ″played a part - no matter how small - in bringing about\nthe claimant’s injury.″ … The Bostic Court shed addition light on Flores’s substantial factor standard\nof causation, holding that it (1) applies to mesothelioma cases as well as asbestosis cases; (2) does not\nrequire a plaintiff to present defendant-specific evidence of but-for causation; and (3) does require a\nplaintiff to, in the absence of ″direct proof of causation,″ present evidence that ″the plaintiff’s exposure\nto the defendant’s product more than doubled his risk of contracting the disease,″ which ″must be\nshown through reliable expert testimony that is based on epidemiological studies or similarly reliable\nscientific testimony″ - i.e., the plaintiff must show that his exposure to each defendant’s products was\nat or above the level of exposure at which his epidemiological evidence showed an above-2.0 relative\nrisk under Havner. … When an expert attempts to rely on an MSDS not for discrete data but to supply\na conclusion on causation, the MSDS must stand up to the same standards applicable to any expert\nopinion on causation; i.e., the proffering party must demonstrate the predicative, methodological, and\nconnective reliability of the analysis that led to the conclusion in the MSDS regarding causation. …\nSimilarly, another Texas court of appeals reversed a lost profits award and rendered a take-nothing\njudgment when the only evidence of lost profits was expert testimony predicated on unfounded\nassumptions. … The Court held that the expert testimony was conclusory under a connective reliability\nanalysis, but the Court specifically approved of the attorney’s use of other settlements as factual\npredicates for his opinion on the value of the Elizondos’ underlying claims: Under Evidence Rule 703,\nexperts may base their testimony on facts or data that are ″of a type reasonably relied upon by experts\nin the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.″ … Because it was based on\nthe unsupported assumptions that the lint transport tube was clogged and that large lint particles could\nhave passed through the dryer’s inlet grill, the expert testimony in Whirlpool lacked predicative\nreliability (as well as connective reliability, as discussed below). iv. … Consistent with the Seventh\nCircuit’s caution that foundational data for an expert opinion cannot be quantitatively or qualitatively\ndisconnected from the facts of the case, Texas courts have rejected damages opinions based on an\nacceptable methodology when the predicative data used in the calculations lacks sufficient similarity\nor comparability to the facts of the case. … The court held that a police officer could rely on hearsay\nstatements made by gang members during custodial and noncustodial interviews, statements made by\nother law enforcement officers, intercepted telephone conversations, and printed and online materials\nbecause law enforcement officers ″routinely and reasonably rely upon hearsay in reaching their\nconclusions.″ … It subsequently rejected ″a bright-line rule for testing in fire cases″ and stated that a\nfire expert can in some circumstances ″offer a reliable opinion based upon specific observation and\nexpertise.″ … The court disagreed, stating that the engineer used well-established principles of physics\nin his calculations, principles that ″have been used and tested (i.e., peer reviewed) by physicists and\nengineers for centuries,″ that his ″mathematical models (a form of test) appeared to be well-grounded\nin the facts and data available,″ and that he used the well-accepted differential-etiology approach,\n″starting from the known facts about the accident and eliminating other possible explanations … until\nhe was left with a hypothesis that was physically possible and that fit the evidence.″ … The Ninth\nCircuit stated in Daubert II that when scientific experts cannot cite any supporting peer-reviewed\npublication, the experts must explain precisely how they went about reaching their conclusions and\npoint to some objective source - a learned treatise, the policy statement of a professional association,\na published article in a reputable scientific journal or the like - to show that they have followed the\n\f                                                                                              Page 3 of 230\n                                           52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *1\n\nscientific evidence method, as it is practiced by (at least) a recognized minority of scientists in their\nfield. … Importantly, the Crump Court applied both the Daubert factors and Gammill’s ″analytical\ngap″ test to the expert’s testimony, stating that ″the mere fact that differential diagnosis was used does\nnot exempt the foundation of a treating physician’s expert opinion from scrutiny - it is to be evaluated\nfor reliability as carefully as any other expert’s testimony. … The Texas Supreme Court has used a\nnumber of phrases to describe the requirements under this gate: the expert must connect the opinion\nwith the existing data, show ″the connection between the data relied on and the opinion offered,″\n″connect the data relied on and his or her opinion and … show how that data is valid support for the\nopinion reached,″ connect ″the expert’s theory to the underlying facts and data in the case,″ connect\nthe expert’s ″observations with his conclusions,″ ″explain the basis of the expert’s statements to link\nhis conclusions to the facts,″ ″explain why″ the data lead to the conclusion, show ″how″ his\nobservations support his conclusions, demonstrate the stated basis for an opinion supports the opinion,\nshow ″the manner in which the principles and methodologies are applied by the expert to reach the\nconclusions,″ and ensure there is no ″flaw in the expert’s reasoning from the data″ that renders the\nexpert’s opinions ″dubious.″ … Importantly, in Whirlpool, the Court rejected the contention that\nexperience can always be used to fill gaps in an expert’s application of the principles, methodologies,\nand facts of the case: If courts merely accept ″experience″ as a substitute for proof that an expert’s\nopinions are reliable and then only examine the testimony for analytical gaps in the expert’s logic and\nopinions, an expert can effectively insulate his or her conclusions from meaningful review by filling\ngaps in the testimony with almost any type of data or subjective opinions. … Based on his experience\nin conducting hundreds of tests with vehicles with soft rubber tires, regular passenger cars, and harder\ntruck tires, he concluded that the test results between the two types of vehicles were consistent. … In\nshort, we have demonstrated that a litigator must endeavor to understand the three reliability gates and\nthe distinctions between them to ensure that each is satisfied, to determine how and when to preserve\nobjections based on each, and to anticipate and protect against postverdict attacks on the reliability of\nexpert testimony. … The key lessons that parties offering and opposing expert testimony should take\naway from this Article are (1) in Texas, expert opinions are subject to both admissibility and\nlegal-sufficiency challenges based on reliability; (2) causation opinions are subject to particularly\nexacting scrutiny; (3) it is the basis of an expert’s opinion, not his qualifications to offer an opinion,\nthat gives the opinion probative value; (4) an expert must identify the basis or predicate for his opinion,\nand if the expert fails to do so, or if the predicate identified is not reliable or does not support the\nexpert’s opinion, the expert’s opinion is likewise not reliable; (5) reliability is not correctness - an\nopinion that is the product of an unreliable methodology is not reliable even if it happens to be correct,\nand conflicting opinions that result from different but reliable methodologies may both be reliable even\nif one is necessarily incorrect; and (6) when an expert opinion is founded in part on reasoning and\nanalysis, a meaningful ″analytical gap″ in the expert’s logic renders the opinion unreliable.\n\nHighlight\nAbstract\n\nExpert testimony can make or break a case at trial. And in Texas, it can make or break the case on\nappeal too. This Article examines developments in the law - with an emphasis on Texas law -\ngoverning the admissibility and evidentiary weight of expert evidence over the last fifteen years.

While some\nattention is given to recent decisions addressing an expert’s qualifications or the relevance and\nhelpfulness of an expert’s opinion, the focus of the Article and the recent case law is on the reliability\nof an expert’s opinions. Breaking the reliability requirement into subcategories, we explore exactly\nwhat it takes for an expert opinion to be reliable and examine when and how an unreliable expert\nopinion can be challenged for the first time postverdict, even if admitted without objection.\n\n    Text\n    [*3]\nIntroduction\nThis Article addresses significant developments in admissibility and reliability challenges to expert\nevidence in the fifteen years since the Houston Law Review’s 1999 article, Eight Gates for Expert\nWitnesses. 1 ″The expert witness occupies a unique place in our adversarial system of justice.″ 2 A jury\nmay view an expert witness as ″an objective authority figure more knowledgeable and credible than\nthe typical lay witness,″ 3 and because an expert necessarily testifies about a subject that is beyond the\ncommon knowledge of the jury, 4 the jury is not as well [*4] equipped to question the reliability of\nthe expert’s opinion. In addition to this heightened potency and considerable insulation from the jury’s\ntypical assessment of reliability, 5 an expert witness is ″generally unfettered″ 6 by many of the\nevidentiary constraints that cabin the testimony of lay witnesses - testifying experts need not have\nfirsthand knowledge, 7 they may base their testimony on material that is otherwise inadmissible, 8 and\nthey may opine on mixed issues of law and fact, including even ultimate issues in the case. 9 For these\nreasons, although the jury assesses the reliability of other types of evidence, 10 the reliability of an\n\n\n\n1\n      See generally Harvey Brown, Eight Gates for Expert Witnesses, 36 Hous.

The Ninth Circuit recently\nparaphrased the text of Rule 702 as identifying these five gates:\n\nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that expert opinion evidence is admissible if: (1)\nthe witness is sufficiently qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education;\n(2) the scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (3) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (4) the\ntestimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (5) the expert has reliably applied the\nrelevant principles and methods to the facts of the case. 19\nThe Sixth Circuit also states that a ″parsing [of] the language of the Rule″ reveals that a proposed\nexpert’s opinion must satisfy three requirements: 20 the expert is qualified, the opinion is sufficiently\nreliable under Daubert, 21 and the testimony assists the [*7] trier of fact. 22 Because the reliability\ninquiry is three gates, it therefore likewise concludes that there are five gates. The Sixth, 23 Seventh,\n24\n   Eighth, 25 and Eleventh 26 Circuits all utilize the same summary of Rule 702’s requirements. 27 The\nThird Circuit agrees that ″Rule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony″ and lists\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787301\"><a href=\"/opinion/787301/patricia-a-wills-individually-and-as-personal-representative-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (2d Cir. 2004) (″Where an injury has multiple potential etiologies, expert testimony is necessary to establish\ncausation.″); Guevara v.

Thus, for example, while an expert’s overwhelming\nqualifications may bear on the reliability of his proffered testimony, they are by no means a guarantor\nof reliability. By the same token, a reliable opinion expressed by a genuinely qualified expert may not\nhelp the jury if it does not pertain to a fact at issue in the case. 30\n\nTexas courts use essentially the same trilogy of tests to analyze the admissibility of expert testimony.\n31\n   The Texas [*8] Supreme Court typically references relevance, rather than assistance to the jury, as\nthe third prong, but the Court has defined relevancy in this context as imposing an ″assistance to the\njury″ requirement. 32\n\nThis division into separate gates does run a risk: it may ″make[] the task of determining admissibility\nsound more mechanical and less judgmental than it really is.″ 33 But in fact, these gates are inextricably\n26\n     Hendrix ex rel.

L. Rev. 1, *12\n\nIn its most recent opinion on qualifications, In re Commitment of Bohannan, the Court found that the\nexpert was qualified and the trial court erred in excluding the expert’s testimony. 56 In re Commitment\nof Bohannan, a case arising from the commitment of an individual deemed to be a sexually violent\npredator (SVP), held that an expert in an SVP proceeding does not have to be licensed as a physician\nor psychologist to be qualified. 57 The Court began with the ″general rule″ that ″an expert must be\nqualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to assist the trier of fact to understand\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue,″ and then stated that a witness’s expertise ″does not\nnecessarily mean that the witness can assist the trier-of-fact. Expert testimony assists the trier-of-fact\nwhen the expert’s knowledge and experience on a relevant issue are beyond that of the average juror\nand the testimony helps the trier-of-fact understand the evidence or determine a fact issue.″ 58 But that\nhelpfulness inquiry only begins the analysis. ″Credentials are important, but credentials alone do not\nqualify an expert to testify.″ 59\n\nReiterating Broders, the Court stressed that the expertise must concern the precise matter at hand. 60\nAs part of the qualifications issue, courts must also examine whether the expert’s testimony is reliable.\n61\n   The Court observed that a person’s mental health is part - but only part - of determining [*13]\nwhether a person is predisposed to sexually violent conduct, and that a factfinder must consider ″all\navailable information″ in making that determination. 62 In determining that issue, ″the kind of\nevaluation done by a psychologist may be at least as important as a medical diagnosis.″ 63\n\nThe usefulness of the expert’s opinion in assisting the trier-of-fact rests not on the type of license the\nexpert holds but on the expert’s knowledge, training, and experience in dealing with sexual offenders.\nA person’s training and experience in clinical interviews and actuarial tests is no less helpful merely\nbecause the person is not licensed as a psychologist. 64\n\nThe Court concluded that ″a person is not disqualified from testifying as an expert in an SVP\ncommitment proceeding merely because the person is not licensed as a physician or psychologist.″ 65\n\nIn re Commitment of Bohannan may be read to expand the issues involved in a qualifications inquiry.\nEven with the best of credentials, an expert may not be qualified to opine on a subject because the\ntechniques involved may not be reliable. On the other hand, an expert with less impressive credentials\n56\n     In re Commitment of Bohannan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307 (Tex. 2012).\n57\n     Id. at 306.\n58\n     Id. at 304.\n59\n     Id.\n60\n     Id. at 305.\n61\n     Id.\n62\n     Id. at 305-06. The Court distinguished commitment proceedings, based on a person’s ″unsound mind″ from SVP proceedings, which\nexpressly did not require a showing of ″unsound mind.″ Id. at 303-04. The Court noted that the Legislature had expressly indicated ″that\nmedical and psychiatric testimony, a constitutional prerequisite for committing a person of unsound mind, is not necessary to SVP\nproceedings.

One federal court has likewise indicated that an expert’s qualifications\nare reviewed in the context of the opinion the expert offers. ″Shoddy preparation by an expert might\nevidence a lack of professional qualifications on the part of a proffered witness.″ 66\n\nFinally, like Helena Chemical, In re Commitment of Bohannan demonstrates the important role of\nissue-framing in assessing expert qualifications. The court of appeals had held in another SVP\nproceeding involving the same expert that the SVP statute contained two distinct issues: whether the\ndefendant has an acquired or congenital condition and whether the defendant has a predisposition to\ncommit a sexually violent offense. 67 The [*14] court of appeals held that medical evidence was\nnecessary to prove the first issue but not the second. 68 Thus, under the court of appeals’ construction\nof the statute, the expert, trained in applying actuarial tests evaluating the risk of recidivism and\nexperienced in identifying that risk among her patients, but not a medical doctor - was qualified to offer\nan opinion on the second issue but not the first. 69 The Texas Supreme Court rejected that ″bisection″\nof the statute, concluding that the statutory inquiry focused on whether the defendant has ″″a condition\nthat … predisposes’ sexually violent conduct,″ such that the conduct and predisposition could not be\nconsidered separately. 70 Under the Court’s single-issue approach, a nonphysician, nonpsychologist,\nlike the expert in In re Commitment of Bohannan, may be deemed qualified to offer all opinion\ntestimony on all necessary components of the statute. Conversely, under the court of appeals’\nbifurcated approach, medical expertise was necessary for the ″condition″ component of the statute. 71\n\nThe Court found experts to be unqualified in General Motors Corp. v. Iracheta, 72 Larson v. Downing,\n73\n   Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez, 74, and In re McAllen Medical Center, Inc. 75 In Iracheta, a\nproducts liability case, the Court concluded that Sanchez, one of plaintiffs’ experts, was not qualified\nto offer opinion testimony on where siphoning occurred in the fuel line of an Oldsmobile Toronado.\n76\n   Sanchez and the plaintiffs’ other expert both admitted that Sanchez was not qualified to offer this\nopinion. 77 While Sanchez and the plaintiffs’ other expert subsequently ″equivocated″ on the subject\nof Sanchez’s qualifications to opine on this subject, ″experts cannot be as ambivalent as these two were\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">Walker</span> <span class=\"page\">v</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Downing, a medical malpractice claim, the Court held that the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding a plastic surgeon as unqualified to testify on the standard of care for\na plastic surgeon. 79 The defendant-physician objected that the expert lacked experience with the\nprocedure the defendant-physician utilized. 80 The Beaumont appellate court found the expert qualified\nbecause he was a licensed physician with a board certification in plastic and reconstructive surgery and\nwas actively practicing medicine when the claim arose. 81 He also ″expressed knowledge of the\naccepted standards of medical care for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of the injury involved in the\nclaim.″ 82 The high court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and affirmed the trial court’s\nexclusion of the physician expert and entry of summary judgment. 83 Although the expert had a number\nof credentials, the Texas Medical Liability Act requires a court to consider whether the expert ″was\nactively practicing medicine in rendering medical care services relevant to the claim,″ and the expert\nhad not performed the surgery at issue in over fifteen years, and there was no evidence that he had ever\ntaught the procedure. 84 ″The trial court was well within its discretion in determining that [the expert]\nwas too far removed from surgical practice and even from teaching.″ 85 Whether to exclude the\nexpert’s testimony was a close call, and close calls must be left to the trial court. 86\nIn Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez, a products liability case, the Court applied the Broders rule\nthat experts must have expertise ″concerning the actual subject about which they are offering an\nopinion″ 87 to hold that the trial court should have excluded a chemist from opining on whether a tire\nhad a manufacturing defect. 88 In Broders, the Court observed that ″given the increasingly specialized\nand technical nature of medicine, there is no validity, if there ever was, to the notion that every licensed\nmedical doctor should be automatically qualified [*16] to testify as an expert on every medical\nquestion.″ 89 Cooper Tire applies the same principle to other highly specialized fields. 90 Though the\nexpert had a degree in chemistry, he had no specialized expertise in tire chemistry and never worked\n78\n     Id. The Iracheta Court went on to address the conclusory, self-contradictory nature of Sanchez’s testimony even after determining\nhe was unqualified to offer an opinion, echoing the implication in In re Commitment of Bohannan that the qualifications inquiry may\nimplicate not only the expert’s credentials but also his methods and analysis.

He also conceded that he did not\nconsider himself an expert in tire design or a forensic tire examiner, and did not hold himself out as\nhaving any expertise in the field of tire manufacturing. The Court found that he was not qualified to\ntestify on the subject of wax migration and contamination in tires and their effect on tire adhesion\nwithout more specialized education, training, or experience in tire chemistry. ″Chemistry is an\nexceedingly vast science divided into several branches and is far beyond the capacity of one person to\nmaster.″ 91\n\nIn re McAllen Medical Center, Inc. concerned whether a physician was qualified to testify in support\nof a negligent credentialing claim. 92 The Court held that she was not. 93 The Court initially noted that\n″a negligent credentialing claim involves a specialized standard of care.″ 94 Her curriculum vitae (CV)\nwas ″a model of brevity″: it did not list where she went to medical school, identify any details about\nher twenty years of practice, list any hospital where she was on staff, or identify any special knowledge\nregarding hospital credentialing. 95 Nothing in her CV, or anywhere else in the record, suggested she\nhad any [*17] special knowledge or expertise regarding hospital credentialing. 96 Therefore, the\noffering party failed to satisfy its burden of showing that she was qualified to testify about standards\nthat govern a hospital’s credentialing process. 97\n\nTo flesh out the qualifications inquiry mandated by Broders and Cooper Tire, civil cases might\nconsider adopting the Court of Criminal Appeals’ qualifications test. In criminal cases, ″qualification\nis a two-step inquiry″: the witness must ″have a sufficient background in a particular field,″ and the\nwitness’s background must ″go[] to the matter on which the witness is to give an opinion.″ 98 The first\ninquiry is more general in nature - such as examining whether an expert on medical issues is a\nphysician - while the second examines whether the expert has ″knowledge, skill, experience, training,\nor education regarding the specific issue before the court that would qualify the expert to give an\n91\n     Id. at 806. Here again, although the Court held that the expert was not qualified to offer an opinion, it discussed not only the expert’s\ncredentials but also the reliability of his opinion. Id. The Court noted that the expert opined that the wax on the skim stock identified\nin a report was the result of contamination rather than migration even though the authors of the report had concluded that they could\nnot determine whether migration was the source of the wax. Id. ″[He] also opined that the wax would adversely affect adhesion, though\nhe could not identify any testing [on the subject] and offered no testimony as to the amount of wax needed to cause a belt or tread to\nseparate.″ Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the Court did not state that the expert’s testimony was unreliable, it at least\nimplied that the reliability of the testimony was questionable. See id. at 806-07. Like Iracheta, Cooper Tire is consistent with the In re\nCommitment of Bohannan concept that the qualifications standards for experts may be something of a sliding scale, depending on the\nreliability of the testimony offered and how much of the reliability must be derived from his credibility as an expert in the field. At a\nminimum, courts may point to the unreliability of an expert’s opinion to buttress their conclusion that the expert lacks the necessary\nqualifications.\n92\n     In re McAllen Med.

The focus is on the fit between the subject matter at issue and the\nexpert’s familiarity with it.″ 99 As the Court of Criminal Appeals explained a year earlier,\n\n″fit″ is not just a component of reliability and relevance - it is also a component of the qualification\ninquiry. Just as the subject matter of an expert’s testimony should be tailored to the facts of a case, the\nexpert’s background must be tailored to the specific area of expertise in which the expert desires to\ntestify. 100\n\nAt least one opinion in a civil case has also used the fit requirement to mandate that the expert’s\nqualifications must match the precise question at hand:\n\nWhether a physician qualifies as an expert is determined by comparing the area in which the witness\nhas such knowledge, skill, experience, or training with the subject matter of the proposed testimony.\nThe focus is on the ″fit″ between the subject matter at issue and the expert’s familiarity of the subject\nmatter … . 101\n [*18]\n\nB. General Principles\n\nTurning from the holdings in these cases to general principles, courts should separately examine the\nexpert’s qualifications for each proffered opinion. 102 Courts do not examine ″whether an expert\nwitness is qualified in general, but whether [the expert’s] ″qualifications provide a foundation … to\nanswer a specific question.’″ 103 Thus, courts may find an expert qualified for one opinion, but not for\nanother. 104 And, as discussed above, how broadly or narrowly a court defines the ″specific question″\nat issue impacts what kind of qualifications the expert must possess. 105\n\n99\n     Id. at 813 (citations omitted). The qualifications standard is lower in criminal cases if the expert’s opinion ″is close to the jury’s\ncommon understanding″; conversely, the expert’s qualifications are more important ″when the evidence is well outside the jury’s own\nexperience.″ Rodgers v.

The Texas Supreme Court has never specified any limitations\non the applicability of the requirement that an objection was necessary to avoid waiver, but it also has\nnot explicitly considered an argument that objections to an expert witness’s qualifications do not have\nto be raised when the qualifications are described in a conclusory manner. In Nissan Motor Co. v.\nArmstrong, the Court declined to address a challenge to an expert witness’s qualifications when the\nopposing party’s pretrial motion to exclude the expert’s testimony ″asserted not that he was unqualified\nbut that his opinions were unreliable.″ 147 On this basis, the Court held that the party’s complaint about\nthe expert’s qualifications ″was not preserved for appeal.″ 148\n\nConsistently, several courts of appeals have stated that ″an objection to an expert’s qualifications must\nbe raised in the trial court in order to preserve error.″ 149 The courts of appeals have [*26] differed,\nhowever, on whether an expert’s qualifications to offer an opinion can be challenged on appeal in the\nabsence of a waiver when the qualifications-based challenge is combined with a challenge that the\nopinion offered is speculative or conclusory, which generally does not require an objection. One court\nheld that the qualifications challenge was waived while the conclusory challenge was not; 150 another\nconcluded that neither challenge is waived when they are combined. 151 The San Antonio Court of\nAppeals, over twenty years ago, described an opinion by an unqualified witness as incompetent, and\n\n146\n      See infra Part III.A.1-2.\n147\n      Nissan Motor Co. v.

In Iracheta, the party whose\nexpert was [*27] challenged argued in the court of appeals that the opposing party waived any\nobjection to the expert’s qualifications by failing to object. 155 The court of appeals rejected this\ncontention, observing that the opposing party had filed a ″Robinson type″ motion to exclude the\nexpert’s testimony in which the party argued that the expert was unqualified to testify. 156 The Texas\nSupreme Court did not expressly address the question of waiver with respect to the qualifications-based\nchallenge to the expert testimony in Iracheta, but it too reached the issue, indicating that the issue was\nnot waived. 157 Courts of appeals have generally treated pretrial motions to exclude expert testimony\nas preserving error with respect to the objections raised in the motions. 158\n\nII. The Assistance and Relevancy Gates\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has frequently linked the requirement that expert evidence ″assist the trier\nof fact″ with the requirement that the evidence be relevant. In Exxon Pipeline Co. v. Zwahr, the Court\nstated, ″the relevance requirement, which incorporates traditional relevancy analysis under Texas Rules\nof Evidence 401 and 402, is met if the expert testimony is ″sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that\nit will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.’″ 159 In TXI Transportation Co. v. Hughes, the Texas\nSupreme Court said, ″An expert’s testimony is relevant when it assists the jury in determining an issue\nor in understanding other evidence.″ 160\n152\n      Mo. Pac. R.R. Co. v.

Zwahr. 223\n\n [*38] The sole issue in Zwahr was whether the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony\nregarding the value of land taken by eminent domain. 224 Exxon argued, and the Texas Supreme Court\nagreed, that the expert had impermissibly relied on the enhanced value a property would have after the\ncondemnation in determining the value of the plaintiffs’ land at the time of the taking. 225 Specifically,\nthe expert had testified that the area of land Exxon had condemned for its pipeline easement was a\nseparate economic unit, created and defined by the parameters of Exxon’s easement, with its ″highest\nand best use″ as a pipeline, and that the plaintiffs’ interest in the area condemned by Exxon was\n″negligible″ before Exxon’s project. 226 The Court held that the expert’s testimony violated the\n″project-enhancement″ rule, which prohibits the jury from considering any enhancement to the value\nof the landowner’s property that results from the taking itself, 227 and also failed to apply the\nhas placed ″renewed emphasis on the importance of the ″fit’ of an expert’s opinion to the data or facts in the case″ and that even when\nan opinion satisfies the Daubert factors, it is inadmissible ″if it does not apply to the specific facts of the case″). ″Including relevance\nin the gatekeeping inquiry reinforces … the importance of ensuring that the proffered opinion … is linked to the facts of the case.″ 2\nGoode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 702.6, at 63.

The\nCourt of Criminal Appeals in Vela was summarizing the evidence rules implicated in expert challenges and specifically relied on Rule\n402 for this last ″condition.″ In explaining these rules, however, the Vela Court quoted from an opinion earlier that same year, Rodgers\nv. State, in which the Court stated that the third condition, relevance, examines whether the ″expert testimony will actually assist the\nfact-finder in deciding the case.″ Vela, 209 S.W.3d at 131 (quoting Rodgers, 205 S.W.3d at 527). Vela’s summary equates relevance with\nassistance. Rodgers relied solely on the text of Rule 702, which explicitly requires the expert testimony to ″assist the trier of fact to\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.″ Rodgers, 205 S.W.3d at 527 (quoting Tex. R. Evid. 702). Vela looked to both\nRule 402 and 702. Vela, 209 S.W.3d at 131. Thus, the Court conflated relevance and helpfulness, which are separate, though overlapping,\ninquiries. They overlap because evidence that is not relevant is not helpful to the factfinder in determining the issues in dispute. But they\ncan also be distinct: evidence may be relevant but excluded as unhelpful because the subject of the testimony is within the common\nknowledge of the jury and the expert offers no knowledge or insight beyond the jury’s purview. While the identification of the gates and\nthe terms differ, the Court of Criminal Appeals’ test does not alter the issues presented by expert testimony. For example, the Court has\nstated that the relevance inquiry examines both whether evidence ″will assist the trier of fact″ and whether it ″is sufficiently tied to the\nfacts of the case.″ Tillman v.

For damages experts in particular, expert evidence that\nexamines the wrong measure of [*39] damages under the law, even if otherwise reliable and\napplicable, is neither relevant nor admissible. 232 Responsibility for ensuring that damages and other\nexperts offer opinions that are based on the proper legal standards falls primarily on the shoulders of\nthe proffering party’s attorney, who is the party’s legal expert. Practitioners thus must be careful to\noversee the work of retained experts to ensure that the evidence the expert provides is the kind of\nevidence that advances the client’s case - including ensuring that experts are using a legally correct\nmeasure of damages, are not relying on elements of damages that the law precludes, and do not\noverlook limitations and discounts that the law requires.\n\nIII. The Reliability Gates\n\nThe admissibility of expert opinion testimony is analyzed under a three-fold inquiry: whether the\nexpert opinion testimony will be helpful to the jury, whether the expert is qualified to offer the opinion\ntestimony, and whether the opinion testimony the expert offers is sufficiently reliable to be admitted.\n233\n    The inquiry into whether expert opinion testimony is sufficiently reliable also can be broken down\ninto three parts: predicative reliability, 234 methodological reliability, 235 and connective reliability. 236\n228\n       Id. at 627-28, 631. The case involved a partial taking, in which ″the before-and-after rule still applies, but compensation is\nmeasured by the market value of the part taken plus any diminution in value to the remainder of the land.″ Id. at 627.

Tamez: ″The trial court should\nundertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies, the method by which the\nexpert draws an opinion from those facts, and how the expert applies the facts and methods to the case\nat hand.″ 237\n\n [*40] Stated differently, the trial court should rigorously examine ″the three components of the\nreliability inquiry - namely, the expert’s methodology, foundational data, and whether too great an\nanalytical gap exists as the expert connects the foundational data or methodology with the opinion.″\n238\n    As one federal court put it: ″The reliability analysis applies to all aspects of an expert’s testimony:\nthe methodology, the facts underlying the expert’s opinion, [and] the link between the facts and the\nconclusion … .″ 239 Another observed that the reliability inquiry examines ″the adequacy of the facts\nor data underlying an opinion, the scientific reliability of the witness’s methodology, and the reliability\nof the witness’s application of that methodology to the facts.″ 240\n\nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence likewise divides the reliability inquiry into three prongs. It\nrequires that expert testimony (1) be ″based on sufficient facts or data″; (2) be ″the product of reliable\nprinciples and methods″; and (3) ″reliably apply the principles and methods to the facts of the case.″\n241\n    As summarized by the Fifth Circuit, trial courts act as ″gate-keepers″ by making a ″preliminary\nassessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid\nand of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.″ 242 This\nthree-fold inquiry applies to each step of [*41] the expert’s reasoning process.

Legal-Sufficiency Challenges to Expert Reliability\n\nOne key aspect of reliability challenges in Texas differs from most jurisdictions. Although federal\ncourts treat expert reliability almost exclusively as an admissibility issue, 252 Texas courts test\nreliability both at the admissibility stage (before or during trial) and at the\nlegal-sufficiency-of-the-evidence stage (after the close of evidence). This unique aspect of Texas law\nsprings from Havner. 253 When it first adopted and applied the U.S. Supreme Court’s Daubert analysis\nin Robinson, the Texas Supreme Court stated that Rule 702 governed the standard for the admission\nof scientific evidence. 254 The Robinson Court stated that the legal [*43] sufficiency of scientific\nevidence ″is outside the scope of Rule 702.″ 255 As in Daubert, the issue in Robinson was whether the\ntrial court erred in excluding expert testimony under Rule 702. 256 That same issue was presented to\nthe Texas Supreme Court in Havner. 257 But the petitioner in Havner also argued that the expert\ntestimony at issue was legally insufficient to support the verdict, and the Court decided the case under\nthe legal-sufficiency analysis rather than under an admissibility analysis. 258 The Havner Court applied\nthe Daubert/Robinson reliability standards to hold that, because the plaintiff’s expert evidence on\nwould accept it as useful and reliable [but it need not be conclusive because] medical knowledge is often uncertain. The human body\nis complex, etiology is often uncertain, and ethical concerns often prevent double-blind studies calculated to establish statistical proof.″).\n\n250\n      Anderson v.

Although parties could challenge expert evidence on either admissibility or\nlegal-sufficiency grounds, they would have to raise any challenge before admission of the evidence,\nand offering parties would have an opportunity to cure defects. The principal difference between expert\nchallenges in Texas and those in other jurisdictions would be the availability of the less deferential\nde-novo standard of review available for legal-sufficiency challenges. 263\n\nBut that was not the Court’s last word. Six years later in Coastal Transport Co. v.

In Maritime Overseas, the plaintiff won a jury verdict on his claim that he suffered from acute and long-term effects\nfrom exposure to a chemical pesticide. Id. at 407. The defendant contended that the standards ″articulated in Robinson and Havner are\nthe proper standards for reviewing the sufficiency of [the plaintiff’s] damages evidence.″ Id. at 408. But the defendant did not challenge\nthe admissibility of the expert testimony nor contend that there was no evidence of any damages. Id. Rather, it argued that the evidence\nwas not reliable for demonstrating the claimed long-term damages and therefore ″would be legally insufficient″ if the court of appeals\nhad applied the proper standard for a factual-sufficiency review. Id.\n262\n       Id. at 409. The Court stated that to hold otherwise would be ″unfair″ because it would ″usurp the orderly and efficient disposition\nof appeals, deprive the proffering party of an opportunity to cure any defects in its evidence that the objecting party might pose,″ permit\ntrial or appeal ″by ambush,″ and ″in some cases, place appellate courts in the undesirable position of making decisions about evidentiary\nreliability absent a fully developed record.″ Id. at 409, 412. Then-Justice, now-Chief Justice, Hecht dissented from the pronouncement\nof this rule, stating:\nAs early as 1912, and as recently as last year, this Court has held that a party may complain after verdict and on appeal that evidence\nadmitted without objection is neither legally nor factually sufficient to support the verdict. The Court ignores a solid line of cases\nestablishing this principle with respect to all kinds of evidence, including scientific testimony. There is no authority for the Court’s\nholding that ″to preserve a complaint that scientific evidence is unreliable and thus, no evidence, a party must object to the evidence\nbefore trial or when the evidence is offered.″\n\nId. at 417 (Hecht, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).\n263\n       The standard of review for admissibility challenges is abuse of discretion, which sets a high bar for reversal.

In Coastal Transport, the Court held that expert\nopinion testimony on gross negligence was conclusory. Id. at 233. The plaintiff had asked its expert three questions regarding whether\nthe defendant’s conduct constituted gross negligence: (1) did it involve a high degree of risk; (2) did the defendant have ″actual subjective\nawareness of the risk″; and (3) did the defendant ″proceed with conscious indifference.″ Id. at 231. The expert answered each question\n\f                                                                                                                            Page 36 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *45\n\nobjection requirement: no preverdict objection is necessary when the expert evidence is ″conclusory\nor speculative and therefore non-probative on its face.″ 265 The Coastal Transport Court stated that\nchallenges to the reliability of an expert’s methodology, 266 technique, or foundational data 267 require\ncourts to look beyond [*46] the face of the record, and therefore require an objection; but challenges\nbased on the conclusory or speculative nature of expert testimony do not require courts to go beyond\n\n\n\n\naffirmatively but was not asked to explain the basis for his affirmative answer to each question. Id. at 231-32. In a postjudgment\nlegal-sufficiency challenge, the defendant argued that the testimony ″amounted to no more than a ″bare conclusion’ that was ″factually\nunsubstantiated’ and therefore constituted no evidence.″ Id. The Court agreed, and held that the conclusory testimony was ″mere ipse\ndixit,″ ″incompetent evidence,″ and ″not relevant.″ Id. at 232. Therefore, Maritime Overseas - which required an objection to expert\ntestimony - was inapplicable. Under Coastal Transport, no ″objection is needed to preserve a no-evidence challenge to conclusory expert\ntestimony.″ Id.\n265\n      Id. at 233. The Court explained that when the expert’s underlying methodology is challenged, a court must ″look[] beyond what\nthe expert said″ to evaluate the reliability of the expert’s opinion. Id. at 253 (quoting Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518823\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518823/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-havner/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712 (Tex. 1997)).\n\nWhen the testimony is challenged as conclusory or speculative and therefore non-probative on its face, however, there is no need to go\nbeyond the face of the record to test its reliability. We therefore conclude that when a reliability challenge requires the court to evaluate\nthe underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made so that the trial court\nhas the opportunity to conduct this analysis. However, when the challenge is restricted to the face of the record - for example, when\nexpert testimony is speculative or conclusory on its face - then a party may challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence even in the\nabsence of any objection to its admissibility.\nId. at 233 (alteration in original).\nCoastal Transport backpedaled from Maritime Overseas’s objection requirement and adopted much of the dissent in that case. Of the six\ncases relied upon by the Court in Coastal Transport, four were cited by the Maritime Overseas dissent. See Mar. Overseas Corp., 971\nS.W.2d at 418, 420 (Hecht, J., dissenting). The Coastal Transport Court distinguished Maritime Overseas because the expert challenge\nthere addressed the expert’s methodology, ″an analysis that should [not] be undertaken for the first time on appeal.″ Coastal Transp., 136\nS.W.3d at 233. Relying on a quote from Maritime Overseas where the Court distinguished the ″non-probative″ value cases relied on by\nthe dissent, the Court held that an objection to expert testimony is unnecessary when the testimony is conclusory or speculative and\ntherefore is not probative on its face. Id. at 233; see also id. at 229. If the defect in the expert’s testimony is apparent on the face of the\nrecord, an objection to admissibility is not required. Id. at 229, 233 (recognizing a distinction between challenges to an expert’s scientific\nmethodology and ″no evidence challenges where, on the face of the record, the evidence lacked probative value″ (quoting Mar. Overseas\nCorp., 971 S.W.2d at 412)).\n266\n      Coastal Transp., 136 S.W.3d at 233 (″When the expert’s underlying methodology is challenged, the court ″necessarily looks beyond\nwhat the expert said’ to evaluate the reliability of the expert’s opinion.″ (quoting Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712)). The distinction between\na challenge to an expert’s methodology and a challenge that the expert testimony constitutes no evidence was recognized by the\nFourteenth Court of Appeals in Graves v. Tomlinson. Graves v. Tomlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2278060\"><a href=\"/opinion/2278060/graves-v-tomlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2010,\npet. denied). When a legal-sufficiency challenge focuses in significant part on expert testimony, an appellate court ″must consider the\ndifference between (1) a challenge to an expert’s methodology; and (2) a legal sufficiency challenge predicated on a contention that an\nexpert’s testimony lacks probative value″ because ″these are two distinct inquiries.″ Id. In this divorce proceeding, the wife, as part of\nher legal-sufficiency challenge, argued that her former husband’s valuation expert used an unreliable methodology to determine the value\nof a community property. Id. at 140-41. Because the former wife did not object before or during trial to the expert’s valuation\nmethodology, she could not raise the issue on appeal. Id. at 146.\n267\n       Although this reference to ″foundational data″ appears to place inadequate predicative materials in the ″objection required″\ncategory, that is not always the case. As discussed in Part III.A and in Part III.B, below, when an expert fails to identify any basis for\nhis opinion, or when the basis the expert identified for his opinion does not actually support his opinion, the opinion is conclusory. For\nexample, as Havner and its progeny demonstrate, when an expert relies on epidemiological studies to support his causation opinion but\nthose studies do not actually support a causal relationship, the expert’s opinion is conclusory and constitutes no evidence. See infra notes\n633-61 and accompanying text.\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 37 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *46\n\nthe face of the record, and therefore do not require an objection. 268 As a result, a party can preserve\nerror regarding the reliability of expert testimony by raising the issue for the first time in postverdict\nlegal-sufficiency challenges, provided the testimony is deemed conclusory or speculative. 269\n\nAt the time, the Coastal Transport exception may have been viewed as a narrow one. 270 But in\nsubsequent cases, the Court [*47] has defined ″conclusory″ and ″speculative″ to incorporate a broad\narray of reliability challenges, and as a result, the Coastal Transport exception to Maritime Overseas’s\nobjection requirement has nearly swallowed the rule. 271 Thus, in Texas, appellate challenges to expert\nevidence are routinely raised and decided under a legal-sufficiency rubric, not the admissibility rubric.\nThe distinction between these is key to determining when and how a party opposing expert opinion\nevidence must raise challenges to the reliability of the evidence, and it shapes the nature of appellate\ncourt review of expert testimony in Texas.\n268\n      Coastal Transp., 136 S.W.3d at 232-33; see also City of San Antonio v. Pollock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895114\"><a href=\"/opinion/895114/city-of-san-antonio-v-pollock/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (Tex. 2009) (quoting Coastal\nTransp., 136 S.W.3d at 233). The Coastal Transport Court stated, ″When the testimony is challenged as conclusory or speculative and\ntherefore non-probative on its face, however, there is no need to go beyond the face of the record to test its reliability.″ Coastal Transp.,\n136 S.W.3d at 233.\n269\n      Coastal Transp., 136 S.W.3d at 233 (″We therefore conclude that when a reliability challenge requires the court to evaluate the\nunderlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made so that the trial court has\nthe opportunity to conduct this analysis.

Coastal Transport, thus, raised the stakes when the issue on appeal is\nwhether expert testimony can be labeled conclusory. See Professor Goode’s criticism of Coastal Transport in infra notes 469-72 and\naccompanying text.\n270\n       The unanimous holding in Coastal Transport was supported by strong precedent.

L. Rev. 1, *47\n\n1. Preservation of Error. For purposes of challenging the reliability of expert evidence, the primary\nprocedural distinction between admissibility challenges and legal-sufficiency challenges is in how a\nparty preserves an objection to expert evidence. The rules for preserving a reliability-based challenge\nto the admissibility of expert evidence are well established. A party must raise reliability objections -\nwhich are distinct from qualifications objections and must be separately preserved 272 - [*48] before\nthe evidence is admitted and obtain a ruling from the trial court. 273 The objection is frequently made\npretrial through a motion to exclude or strike expert testimony. 274 But a party should be cautious about\nrelying exclusively on a pretrial motion because the expert’s trial testimony may differ from the pretrial\ndisclosures. 275 ″[A] careful party will urge its objections both before trial and re-urge them when the\n\n\n\n272\n      A qualifications objection does not preserve a reliability challenge.

L. Rev. 1, *50\n\n282\n    which must be raised prior to admission of the evidence. Because Texas courts allow both types of\nchallenges (legal-sufficiency and admissibility) to the reliability of expert opinion evidence, a question\narises about when an objection to the reliability of expert evidence must be raised before the evidence\nis admitted and when it can be raised for the first time postverdict.\n\nOver the last fifteen years, the answer to this question has largely come down to whether the evidence\nis categorized as ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″ and therefore, ″non-probative on its face.″ If it is, no\npreverdict objection is required; if it is not, then failure to object before the expert is admitted waives\nthe complaint. Determining whether expert evidence is ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″ is thus a critical\nissue for parties offering or opposing expert evidence in Texas. This issue is discussed in the next\nsection. 283\n\n2. When Is Opinion Evidence ″Conclusory″ or ″Speculative″? Objections to the admissibility of\nevidence must be raised before the evidence is admitted, but Texas courts have long allowed late\nchallenges to incompetent evidence. 284 Any unreliable expert opinion is inadmissible and thus subject\nto an admissibility objection before or at trial. But only ″conclusive″ or ″speculative″ expert opinions\nare incompetent such that an objection can be raised for the first time postverdict. 285 Because a\nconclusory [*51] objection can be raised postverdict even if the opinion was admitted without\nobjection, it is important to define when an opinion is conclusory. But it is sometimes difficult to draw\na line between conclusory expert testimony, and expert testimony that is unreliable but not conclusory\nor speculative. ″Some objections will fall close to the line″ between evidence that is conclusory and\nevidence that is unreliable but not conclusory. 286 Because of these uncertainties, the best rule of\npractice from an appellate standpoint is to object to the witness’s opinion testimony both before trial\nand during trial.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has struggled with trying to find a middle course that simultaneously allows\nlegal-sufficiency challenges but also prevents appeals on issues never raised before the trial court - that\nis, ″appeal by ambush.″ 287 And this struggle not only impacts legal-sufficiency challenges, but also\nmay impact factual-sufficiency challenges; arguably a factual-insufficiency challenge could incorporate\nan argument raised for the first time postverdict that the expert’s opinion is conclusory or speculative.\nThus, when a claim or defense is supported by other evidence (and therefore, a successful challenge\nto the expert’s opinion cannot result in a legal-sufficiency challenge), the conclusory objection may\n282\n      See cases cited infra note 458.\n283\n      See discussion infra Part III.A.2.\n284\n      City of Keller v.

A principal basis the Texas Supreme Court has used to identify ″conclusory″ expert\ntestimony is whether the expert has identified the basis for his opinion or whether the jury essentially\nmust take the expert’s word for it. 288 Thus, the Court held in Burrow v. Arce, City of San Antonio v.\nPollock, and [*52] Elizondo v. Krist that expert testimony was conclusory because the expert\nessentially asked the jury to ″take my word for it.″ 289 Conversely, in Arkoma Basin the Court held that\nexpert testimony was not conclusory because the expert ″did not simply state a conclusion without any\nexplanation, or ask jurors to ″take my word for it.’″ 290 And in General Motors Corp. v. Sanchez, 291\na products liability suit, the Court rejected a challenge to the speculativeness of expert testimony\nbecause the expert offered ″more … than [his] bald assertion that his design would be safer.″ 292 The\nexpert had described the product’s operation ″at length, and explained in some detail how his proposed\ndesign would make the transmission safer,″ 293 and his ″testimony about the engineering principles\nunderlying his proposed design supported his conclusion.″ 294\n\nThe applicability of the ″baseless″ and ″ipse dixit″ labels has evolved over time. Even before Robinson\nand Havner, the Court held ″conclusory statements made by an expert witness are insufficient to\nsupport summary judgment.″ 295 Initially, this rule of law was applied to preclude a judgment entered\nin reliance on an expert opinion for which the expert provided no basis or explanation whatsoever,\ninstead merely stating an opinion. 296 But beginning in Havner, 297 the rule began to expand to include\nopinion testimony for which an expert offered some basis or [*53] explanation, but the explanation\n288\n      Elizondo v.

The Court explained:\n\nIt could be argued that looking beyond the testimony to determine the reliability of scientific evidence is incompatible with our no\nevidence standard of review. If a reviewing court is to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the argument runs,\na court should not look beyond the expert’s testimony to determine if it is reliable.

It reduces\nthe no evidence standard of review to a meaningless exercise of looking to see only what words appear in the transcript of testimony,\nnot whether there is in fact some evidence.\nId. at 712.

In 2004, when the Court held in Coastal Transport that a legal-sufficiency\nchallenge to conclusory or speculative expert evidence could be raised on appeal despite the lack of\na preverdict objection, 313 it did so in reliance on this precedent, holding that the expert opinion\nevidence in the case constituted the expert’s ″bare conclusions″ or ″mere ipse dixit.″ 314 After Coastal\nTransport, however, the use of the terms ″conclusory″ and ″speculative″ continued to expand.\n\n\n307\n      Id. at 235.\n308\n      Id. at 236.\n309\n      See Anderson v.

Ramirez. 318 These\nopinions refined the application of the ″conclusory″ label to expert evidence in an important way by\nholding that the expert opinions in those cases were speculative or conclusory, and therefore no\nevidence, because they failed the analytical gap test - i.e., they lacked connective reliability. 319 The\n [*56] holdings in Burrow and Ratliff set the stage for this aspect of the ″conclusory″ definition when\nthey stressed the need for an opinion witness to ″explain why″ and ″link his conclusions to the facts.″\n320\n    Since Kerr-McGee and Ramirez, expert testimony that is unreliable due to a lack of connective\nreliability has been frequently treated as conclusory or speculative, such that it cannot support a\njudgment even if admitted without objection. 321\n\nIn 2009 the Texas Supreme Court decided City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 322 in which it held that there\nwas no evidence that the Pollocks’ daughter contracted a particular form of leukemia as a result of\nbenzene exposure from a closed landfill located near the Pollocks’ home. 323 The Court held that the\nexperts’ causation opinions were conclusory and that this defect had not been waived by the city’s\nfailure to raise it in a pre-admission objection. 324 The Court held that the causation opinion offered\nby the Pollocks’ first expert, Kraft, suffered a fatal ″analytical gap″ and was conclusory because it was\nbased on exposure levels that the expert failed to tie back to the Pollocks’ exposure levels. 325 The\n315\n      The ″analytical gap″ test is the fundamental test for connective reliability.

Nor can an appellate court assume this role, particularly after the\nwitnesses have testified, been dismissed, and the record closed.″ 328 According to Justice Medina,\nunreliability caused by analytical gaps does not render opinion testimony conclusory and should also\nrequire a trial objection. 329 Relying on Arkoma Basin, Justice Medina argued the difference is\n″between something and nothing.″ 330 ″An expert’s testimony is [treated as] conclusory if the expert\nmerely gave an unexplained conclusion or asked the jury to ″take my word for it’ because of his status\nas an expert.″ 331 But, for Justice Medina, the opinion is not conclusory ″if the expert purports to rely\non something more than his credentials or reputation.″ 332\n\nThis complaint is, in part, why some commentators disfavor Texas’s legal-sufficiency review of expert\nevidence, as discussed in the next section. 333 But the Pollock standard prevailed and has [*58] been\nlargely unquestioned in Texas law for the last five years. 334 The Court recently reaffirmed Pollock’s\napplication of the ″analytical gap″ test to legal-sufficiency challenges in Elizondo v. Krist, holding that\nwho was a treating pediatric oncologist. The Court held his testimony was conclusory under the ″analytical gap″ test discussed above.\nId.\n326\n      Additionally, none of the literature in the record supported the expert’s assertion that ″long-term exposure to a low level of toxin\nmight″ cause the disease. Id. at 819-20. Finally, all the epidemiological studies on the disease did not satisfy the Havner standards for\ncausation evidence in a toxic tort case. Id. at 820.\n327\n      Id. at 822 (Medina, J., dissenting).\n328\n      Id.\n329\n      Id. at 823.\n330\n       Id. Justice Medina stated that the Pollocks’ experts did not ″ask[] the jury to trust their opinion merely on the basis of their\nexpertise. They instead purported to analyze″ the data underlying their opinion. Id. at 828. Thus, the city’s ″complaints about analytical\ngaps [are] nothing more than an unpreserved reliability challenge. Analytical gaps are not complaints about naked opinions, lacking any\nbasis in the record, but rather are assertions that specific errors or omissions in an expert’s analysis render his or her opinion unreliable.″\nId. He concluded:\nThe Court’s opinion today unfortunately blurs the distinction between expert testimony that purports to have a basis in science (unreliable\nexpert testimony) and expert testimony that lacks any apparent support apart from the expert’s claim to superior knowledge (conclusory\nexpert testimony). The Court’s decision today is not only wrong, it is also unfair and may encourage gamesmanship in the future. Why\nhave a pretrial Robinson hearing or make a reliability objection during trial and run the risk that the proffering party may fix the problem,\nwhen the expert’s opinion can be picked apart for analytical gaps on appeal?\n\nId. at 828-29 (footnote omitted).\n331\n      Id.\n332\n      Id. at 824.\n333\n      See infra Part III.A.5.\n334\n      See, e.g., Elizondo v.

The Robinson Factors. 336 In Havner, the Texas Supreme Court stated that, although Robinson\naddressed the admissibility of expert evidence, ″the Robinson factors″ may be applied in a no evidence\nreview of scientific evidence. 337 But after Havner, the Court did not rely on the Robinson factors in\na legal-sufficiency review for nearly a decade. In 2006, the Texas Supreme Court began incorporating\nthe Robinson factors in legal-sufficiency reviews of expert evidence again, further broadening the\napplicability of the ″conclusory or speculative″ label. In Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mendez 338 and\nMack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 339 both products liability cases, the Court utilized the Robinson factors\nin holding that an expert’s opinion was speculative and therefore no evidence. 340 In both cases, the\nCourt determined that the expert’s testimony lacked connective reliability. 341 But because the Court\nreviewed the experts’ [*59] methodology in reaching that determination, Cooper Tire and Mack\nTrucks indicate that a lack of methodological reliability can contribute to a lack of connective\nreliability, resulting in ″conclusory″ or ″speculative″ expert testimony.\n\nThe Court reaffirmed this principle in Whirlpool Corp. v. Camacho, 342 when it applied the Robinson\nfactors to hold that expert opinion testimony was conclusory and therefore not entitled to probative\nweight. 343\nIf Cooper Tire and Mack Trucks indicate that methodological and connective reliability are\noverlapping and may combine to render evidence conclusory or speculative, then Whirlpool indicates\nthat methodological and predicative reliability are overlapping and the former may combine to render\nevidence conclusory or speculative.

Nonprobative Predicates. 354 In City of San Antonio v. Pollock, 355 the Court defined ″conclusory″\nexpert evidence to include not only when ″no basis for the opinion is offered″ but also when ″the basis\noffered provides no support″ for the opinion. 356 The Court formulated the test this way:\nWhen a scientific opinion is admitted in evidence without objection, it may be considered probative\nevidence even if the basis for the opinion is unreliable. But if no basis for the opinion is offered, or\nthe basis offered provides no support, the opinion is merely a conclusory statement and cannot be\nconsidered probative evidence, regardless of whether there is no objection. 357\n\n[*63] The Court’s most recent expert decision, Houston Unlimited, Inc. Metal Processing v. Mel Acres\nRanch, quoted and reaffirmed Pollock’s definition of ″conclusory,″ explaining that the rationale for this\nrule is that ″the evidentiary value of expert testimony is derived from its basis, not from the mere fact\nthat the expert has said it.″ 358\nThe conclusory nature of the expert testimony in Pollock arises largely under the ″analytical gap″ test\ndiscussed above. But the Pollock Court’s definition of conclusory, and particularly its rejection of Dr.\nPatel’s opinion testimony, underscored that a ″gap″ can arise not just from an expert’s failure to\nlogically connect supporting data to his conclusion (a connective reliability issue 359), but also from\nan expert’s connection of his conclusion to data that simply does not support the conclusion (a\npredicative reliability issue 360). Dr. Kraft’s testimony fit squarely in the first category, 361 but Dr.\nPatel’s testimony also fit into the latter. Dr. Patel’s opinion essentially fell short in the same way that\nthe expert opinions in Havner fell short: he cited studies and articles but they did not tend to prove a\ncausal connection between the Pollocks’ level of benzene exposure and birth defects. Thus, Pollock\nliterature. Similarly, predicate data is often part of the record and therefore may be reviewed postverdict.

In holding that an\nobjection was necessary to preserve the expert opinion challenges in Maritime Overseas, the Court\nthere distinguished Havner on the ground that the party opposing the expert testimony in Havner had\ntimely objected to the testimony. 362 But Pollock may be read to suggest that Havner would have come\nout the same way even in the absence of an objection.\nThe year after Pollock, the Court issued two more opinions holding that expert opinion testimony on\ncausation was conclusory because, while the experts explained the basis for their opinions, ″the basis\noffered provided no support″ 363 for their conclusions. 364 Both of these cases were products liability\n [*64] cases in which the expert’s causation opinion was predicated on facts that were equally\nconsistent with alternative theories of causation; the predicates thus failed to tend to prove the expert’s\ncausation theory was more likely than the alternative causation theories.\n\nIn the first of these, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 365 the plaintiffs’ expert theorized that a house\nfire was most likely caused by the explosion of a halogen bulb in a lamp purchased at Wal-Mart, which\nsent ″burning glass shards onto″ a nearby recliner, where the shards ″smoldered for several hours″ and\nthen grew into a fire. 366 The Wal-Mart expert, on the other hand, concluded that ″the more likely cause\nof [the] fire was careless disposal of smoking materials.″ 367 Wal-Mart argued that the plaintiffs’ expert\ntestimony constituted no evidence of causation because it ″lacked factual substantiation,″ and the Texas\nSupreme Court agreed. 368 The Court noted that the plaintiffs’ expert had ruled out smoking materials\nas the cause of the fire because there was no evidence of burnt cigarettes near the recliner, but there\nwas ″no evidence of charred or exploded glass″ near the recliner either. 369 The Court held that,\nbecause the plaintiffs’ expert failed to ″explain or adequately disprove alternate theories of causation,″\nhis own theory was ″speculative and conclusory.″ 370\nMore damaging to the reliability of the plaintiffs’ expert than his failure to discredit opposing causation\ntheories was his failure to provide support for his own ″specific causation theory.″ 371 Although he had\ndemonstrated generally the dangers of halogen lamps and the possibility that a fire could be ignited by\nthe explosion of a halogen bulb, the Court concluded that ″evidence that halogen lamps can cause fires\n\n\n362\n      Mar.

This\nshows how a lack of predicative reliability can result in a lack of connective reliability - i.e., an\nanalytical gap. An expert’s efforts to ″connect″ her conclusion to a factual or scientific predicate cannot\nsucceed when the predicate does not, in fact, logically support the expert’s conclusion.\n\nThe Court applied the same principle in Jelinek v. Casas, a medical malpractice case in which the\nplaintiff asserted that the hospital’s failure to administer antibiotics caused an infection. 374 The\nplaintiff’s expert conceded that the circumstantial evidence supporting his causation opinion was\n″equally consistent″ with two other theories of causation - neither of which could be attributed to the\nnegligence of the hospital. 375 ″When the facts support several possible conclusions, only some of\nwhich establish that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiff’s injury,″ the Court stated, ″the\nexpert must explain to the factfinder why those conclusions are superior based on verifiable medical\nevidence, not simply the expert’s opinion.″ 376\n\nApplying the equal inference rule, the Jelinek Court explained that it was ″equally plausible that [the\npatient] had [an anaerobic] infection or that she did not. [The expert] opined that she did, but he did\nnot explain why that opinion was superior to the opposite view. Such evidence raises no more than a\npossibility of causation, which is insufficient.″ 377 The expert also relied on evidence of a foul smell,\na finding consistent with an anaerobic infection, to support his opinion that she suffered from an\nundetected anaerobic infection. 378 The hospital, however, [*66] offered other explanations for the\nsmell. 379 Because the evidence included ″competing explanations for the smell″ and only ″meager″\ncircumstantial evidence, the jury would be compelled to speculate and ″could not reasonably infer an\ninfection caused by the Hospital’s negligence.″ 380 In short, in the same way that a jury may not\nreasonably infer one fact over the other from evidence that is equally consistent with either, 381 an\nexpert may not draw one conclusion over the other from predicate data that is equally consistent with\neither.\n372\n      Id.\n373\n      Id.; Merrell v.

Experts who testify on\nbehalf of parties to a lawsuit are subject to biases and potential abuses that are not always present\noutside the courtroom, and the courtroom itself may afford experts a veneer of credibility not present\nin other contexts. Legal sufficiency review requires courts to ensure that a jury that relies on an\nexpert’s opinion has heard factual evidence that demonstrates that the opinion is not conclusory on its\nface. Here, [the expert’s] reliance on insufficient data and unsupported assumptions and the analytical\ngaps in her analysis render her opinion conclusory and without evidentiary value. 383\n\ne. Predicates Without Evidentiary Support. 384 Shortly after Coastal Transport another kind of\n″conclusory″ opinion came into focus: opinions based on facts or assumptions that lack evidentiary\nsupport. 385 In 2005, the Court issued its magnum opus on the standards of evidentiary review: City\nof Keller v. [*67] Wilson. 386 Under City of Keller, if an expert’s opinion is incompetent - for whatever\nreason - no objection is necessary. 387 The Court observed in City of Keller that contrary evidence may\n″render[] supporting evidence incompetent.″ 388 ″Incompetent evidence [does not] support a judgment,\neven if admitted without objection.″ 389 As an example of incompetent expert testimony, the Court\nnoted that when ″an expert’s opinion is based on certain [factual] assumptions,″ other evidence may\ndemonstrate that those ″assumptions were unfounded,″ making the opinion unreliable. 390 Thus, an\nappellate court conducting a no-evidence review cannot consider only an expert’s bare opinion, but\nmust also consider contrary evidence showing it has no scientific basis. 391\n\nf.

Juries - or in the case of expert\nreports, judges - are often confronted with conflicting expert testimony. One expert may testify that X caused the plaintiff’s injuries while\na different expert may testify that X did not cause the plaintiff’s injuries. The factfinder typically lacks the expertise necessary to form\nan opinion without expert assistance - this is why expert testimony is admitted in the first place. It is the expert’s explanation of ″how’\nand ″why’ causation exists that allows the factfinder to weigh the credibility of the expert’s opinion and, when expert opinions conflict,\nto decide which testimony to disregard″).\n\nA jury cannot evaluate the basis of an expert’s opinion, for example, when the expert claims to rely on general scientific principles like\nthe laws of physics or general principles of a field such as engineering.

Without explicitly stating that the applicable standard of review is ″de novo,″ the Texas Supreme Court stated:\nGenerally, rulings on objections as to admissibility of evidence, including whether expert testimony is reliable, are reviewed for abuse\nof discretion. But a party may assert on appeal that unreliable scientific evidence or expert testimony is not only inadmissible, but also\nthat its unreliability makes it legally insufficient to support a verdict.\nUnlike review of a trial court’s ruling as to admissibility of evidence where the ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion, in a no-evidence\nreview we independently consider whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to reach the verdict.\n\nId. at 638 (citations omitted).

These issues are complicated by differences in the types of\nevidence on which an expert may rely and in the types of reliability challenges that may be raised in\nTexas, where reliability attacks can come in the form of before-the-fact challenges to the admissibility\nof the evidence or after-the-fact challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury\nverdict.\n\nWhether a challenge to expert evidence will fail or succeed frequently depends on the nature of the\ncomplaint, what is in the record, what is not in the record, and who bears the burden of creating the\nrecord. This is particularly true in a legal-sufficiency challenge, which, as discussed above, is limited\nto the ″face of the record.″ 404 The Court’s ″face of the record″ reviews are sometimes [*72] based\non the content of the expert’s predicative facts, data, or studies. 405 This raises questions about when\npredicative material must be put in the record and who bears the burden of creating that record. Both\nthe Federal and Texas Rules of Evidence expressly permit an expert to testify as to his opinion and give\nhis reasons for the opinion without first disclosing the underlying facts or data on which the opinion\nis based. 406 And both rules note that the expert may nevertheless be required to disclose the underlying\nfacts or data on cross-examination. 407 The Texas Rule expressly contemplates that the expert may be\nrequired to disclose underlying material on direct examination. 408\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court held that the expert testimony in Pollock was conclusory by examining the\npredicative studies the expert relied on to determine whether they provided any support for the expert’s\ncausation opinion. 409 It is not clear what the Court would have done if the studies identified by the\nexpert as supporting his conclusion had not been in the record, although it seems unlikely that the\nabsence of predicative studies in the record would convert an expert opinion from ″no evidence″ into\n″some evidence.″ 410 But in Arkoma Basin, 411 in addition to [*73] challenging the expert’s\nmethodology for determining the value of the plaintiffs’ mineral interests, the defendant objected that\n404\n      See supra notes 265, 268-69, 290, 352 and accompanying text.\n405\n      In Pollock, for example, the Court rejected expert testimony that exposure to benzene had caused plaintiffs’ daughter, Sarah, to\ndevelop leukemia in utero.

The defendant did not contest that\nexposure to benzene could cause leukemia; only specific causation - whether benzene exposure had actually caused Sarah’s leukemia\n- was challenged. Id. at 818; see also infra notes 604-07 and accompanying text (discussing general and specific causation). The Court\nreviewed the studies relied on by the plaintiffs’ expert, observing that the studies recognized that the causal connection between benzene\nand chromosomal aberrations was ″clearly dose dependent″ and none of the studies showed chromosomal aberrations resulting from\nbenzene exposure of ″less than 10 ppm - more than 60 times″ Sarah’s level of exposure. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 819 (footnotes omitted).\nThe Court thus concluded that the studies relied on by the expert did not support his conclusion that Sarah’s low-level benzene exposure\ncaused her chromosomal aberrations.

See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 818. Otherwise, at least in the absence of an\nobjection, a plaintiff’s expert who puts no predicative materials into the record would be better off than one who put some predicative\nmaterials into the record, because the Court would be unable to review the materials to determine whether they actually supported the\nexpert’s conclusion. But only a year before Pollock, the Court said in Arkoma Basin that ″experts are not required to introduce such\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 57 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous.

The Texarkana Court of Appeals stated in\nMinnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. Atterbury that when a party’s expert relies on a study, the\nparty must ″identify the study, get it admitted into evidence, and explain how the methodology of the\nstudy is scientifically reliable.

At least to some degree, this statement conflicts with the implication that when an expert offers into evidence\nno foundational material to support his or her opinion, the opinion is nonprobative and can be challenged even in the absence of an\nobjection by the opposing party. See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 823-25 (Medina, J., dissenting) (discussing Arkoma Basin and arguing that\nthe challenge to the plaintiff’s expert testimony should have been treated as an attack on methodology that had to be raised by objection).\nAlong these lines, it could be argued that an objection that the expert’s testimony is conclusory - which was the objection made in Pollock\n- notifies the opposing party and trial court under Rule 705(a) that the party is ″insisting″ on the underlying evidence being presented.\nUnder this interpretation, a party challenging expert testimony that the expert states is supported by data not part of the record should\nobject that the opinion is conclusory (thereby arguably invoking Rule 705(a)’s provision that a party may insist on the underlying data);\nto do so may cause the opinion to be treated as having no basis under Pollock rather than having a basis that is not in the record under\nArkoma Basin.\nAlternatively, one could argue that the identification of studies that are not in the record provides ″some explanation″ of the basis of the\nopinion. If the plaintiff in Pollock had merely recited the studies but the studies had not been made part of the trial record, would it have\nprevailed under the reasoning of Arkoma Basin? Justice Brister, the author of Arkoma Basin, while sitting on the Fourteenth Court of\nAppeals, once ordered the parties in a case involving the benzene scientific issues at issue in Pollock to supplement the record on appeal\nwith literature relied on by the experts even though it was not part of the trial record.

Pollock also suggests that an objecting party should probably consider putting\nany studies relied upon by the expert in the record if the studies clearly do not support the expert’s opinion. If the studies’ significance\nare debatable, the party faces the more difficult question of whether it is better to have the studies omitted from the record, and to argue\nthat under Texas law the absence of the studies makes the opinion ipse dixit and without any factual basis.\n411\n      Arkoma Basin, 249 S.W.3d at 380.

A ruling sustaining the defendant’s reliability ″objections to the causation opinion is not\nimplicit″ in the trial court’s order granting summary judgment and did not preserve error because the trial court could have granted\nsummary judgment on two other grounds urged in the trial court - no duty and no breach of a duty. Id. at 300. The court was also troubled\nabout attempting to rule on reliability without a record of the hearing because two different standards of review are implicated in an\nexpert challenge in the summary judgment context: abuse of discretion for an evidentiary objection based on lack of reliability and legal\nsufficiency for the summary judgment. Id. If the abuse of discretion standard is applied to the evidentiary issue,\n\nthis approach would reduce the summary judgment appellate review standard to an abuse of discretion standard whenever\ncase-determinative Robinson objections, coupled with a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, are considered implicitly sustained\nby the granting of summary judgment.

Flores, even if there was evidence that benzene exposure can cause\nrenal cell carcinoma at some exposure level, the plaintiff had failed to present evidence of what that\nexposure level is and whether the plaintiff had that level of exposure. 434\n\nIn the view of the Authors of this Article, Schronk, Minnesota Mining, and Brookshire Bros. are more\nconsistent with Texas Supreme Court authority reviewing expert evidence than Pink and BNSF. It is\nworth noting that the Texas Supreme Court denied the petitions for review in Schronk, Minnesota\nMining, and Brookshire Bros. The Supreme Court has not had an opportunity to review Pink or BNSF.\nAfter Goodyear filed a [*78] petition for review in Pink, the Court requested a response to the petition\nfor review and later full briefing on the merits. 435 But the parties settled the case and dismissed the\nappeal before full briefing was completed. 436 BNSF is pending before the Texas Supreme Court. 437\n\nReading Arkoma Basin in concert with Pollock, we conclude that the Texas Supreme Court is likely\nto treat the burden of placing predicative expert materials into the record much like it treated the\npreservation of error issue. Challenges to the soundness or trustworthiness of predicative material -\nsuch as an argument that a medical study was the product of a flawed methodology - must be raised\nbefore the trial court admits the expert opinion based on that material. 438 But challenges to the\n\nId.\nAnother problem is that Robinson hearings can include live testimony but summary judgment hearings cannot.

The court\nstated:\nConsidered with notice and opportunity-to-be-heard principles, these differences require that the two proceedings be separate under the\ncircumstances of this case, and that we not consider [the defendant’s] reliability objections as implicitly sustained by the trial court…\n. By conducting a separate Robinson hearing before considering a no-evidence motion for summary judgment, the trial court applies the\nprocess applicable to each hearing, provides the parties notice and an opportunity to present the best available evidence, and provides\nthe appellate court with a full record for review.

L. Rev. 1, *78\n\nprobativeness of predicative material - such as an argument that a medical study does not support the\nexpert’s causation opinion because the study did not find sufficient correlation to indicate causation -\ncan be raised postverdict even if the expert’s opinion is admitted into evidence without objection.\nBecause predicative materials for expert opinions must be both trustworthy (i.e., reliable) and\nprobative (i.e., tending to make the expert’s conclusion more likely to be true), proffering parties\nshould always try to create a record of the materials that support their experts’ opinions. If an expert’s\nopinion is admitted into evidence without objection and there is no challenge to the predicative\nmaterials on which the expert relied, it is our position that the court must take the predicative materials\nin the record at face value - i.e., presume them to be trustworthy. 439 But if the predicative materials\nin the record do not support the expert’s conclusions, the expert’s opinion will not stand up on review,\nregardless of whether an objection was made. If the predicative materials are not in the record at all,\nthey cannot be reviewed to determine whether they actually support the expert’s opinions, even if the\nmaterials are presumed to be trustworthy.\n\n [*79]   The proffering party thus likely bears the burden of creating a record to support expert\ntestimony, regardless of whether an objection was made. 440 But if the probative value of the predicate\nis evident on the face of the expert’s testimony, the absence of the predicative materials from the record\nwill not be fatal. This approach is consistent with both opinions. In Arkoma Basin, because the Court\ntreated the numbers on which the damages expert relied as trustworthy, the expert’s damages testimony\nwas not devoid of support. 441 The probativeness of those numbers was evident from the expert’s\ncalculations, which were in the record from the expert’s testimony and exhibits. 442 Thus, the expert’s\nopinion was reliable. But in Pollock, the expert’s testimony on causation was devoid of support even\nif the studies on which he relied were trustworthy because the studies did not support (i.e., were not\nprobative of) a causal connection. Thus, the expert’s opinion was unreliable regardless of whether the\nstudies were in the record.\n\nFinally, if the connection between the predicative material and the expert’s conclusions is not facially\nevident - a ″connective reliability″ issue, discussed in detail below 443 - the offering party probably\nbears the burden of creating a record to support the connection in order to establish that the expert’s\nconclusion has evidentiary weight, even in the absence of an objection.\n\nIn discussing the development of the record to support expert testimony, we must consider one last\nprocedural difference between a legal-sufficiency review and a review of the admission or exclusion\nof evidence. In the context of a legal-sufficiency review, the Texas Supreme Court has instructed courts\n\n439\n        Predicative Probativeness″ is discussed in the section on ″Predicative Reliability″ below.

L. Rev. 1, *79\n\nto review the ″entire record″ in analyzing the reliability of expert testimony. 444 This means two things\nwith respect to including predicative expert materials in the record. First, supportive materials included\nin the record will be considered by the court and thus may add to the expert’s reliability; supportive\nmaterials not included in the record offer no value beyond that [*80] afforded to the expert’s ability\nto rely on the materials, if any. 445 And if supportive predicative reliability materials are not included\nin the record but the opposing party includes in the record predicative material favoring a contrary\nconclusion, the expert’s opinion may be deemed unreliable. For instance, the Waco court in Schronk\nrejected the expert’s conclusion that the failure of the AED caused the death in part because the\nstatistical data the expert referenced (but did not include in his report) was contradicted by an American\nHeart Association report that was included in the record. 446 Thus, regardless of whether an offering\nparty must ensure that an expert’s predicative materials are included in the record as part of the burden\nto establish reliability, the offering party should do so as a practical matter.\n\nIn developing a record, parties must be cognizant of the distinction between exhibits and testimony\noffered at trial and exhibits and testimony offered at a pretrial Daubert hearing. In Exxon Corp. v.\nMakofski, the dissenting justice would have concluded that a party waived its challenge to the\nreliability of the predicate for the opposing party’s expert’s causation opinion by failing to obtain a\nrecord from the pretrial hearing on the motions to exclude the expert’s testimony. 447 In an opinion\nwritten by former Texas Supreme Court Justice Brister, then sitting on the Fourteenth Court of Appeals,\nthe court rejected the waiver argument, noting that ″following this argument to its logical conclusion,\nevery time a pretrial motion to strike expert testimony is denied without a reporter’s record, we must\npresume any jury verdict thereafter is valid (no matter how scientifically unsound).″ 448 The court\nstated that a record of the pretrial hearing would be necessary to review a challenge to the trial court’s\ndecision to admit the expert evidence, but it was not necessary to a challenge to the legal sufficiency\nof the evidence to support the jury verdict. 449\n\nOne other issue is whether the opposing party might want to offer the predicate materials relied on by\nthe opposing expert. An opposing party might consider offering (at least into the record for appellate\npurposes) portions of the expert’s materials if the materials do not in fact support the opinion. For\nexample, in [*81] Makofski, the expert relied on articles that did not reach the conclusion cited by\nthe expert. 450 On the other hand, if the party offering the testimony has the burden to offer the\npredicate materials, the party might not want to include them in the record if the study does not directly\nand clearly contradict the expert’s opinion.\n444\n      Whirlpool Corp. v.

L. Rev. 1, *81\n\nFinally, different considerations come into play when an expert’s predicative material is of a kind that\nis generally inadmissible, such as hearsay. 451 Under both Federal and Texas Rules of Evidence, an\nexpert may rely on facts or data that are not themselves admissible into evidence as long as they are\nthe kinds of facts or data on which experts in the field would reasonably rely. 452 Likewise, both the\nFederal and Texas Rules provide that when the underlying material would otherwise be inadmissible,\nthe material may not be admitted into evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value\nas explanation or support for the expert’s opinion. 453 The Texas Rule further provides that such\nmaterial must be excluded ″if the danger that [it] will be used for a purpose other than as explanation\nor support for the expert’s opinion outweighs [its] value as explanation or support″ and requires the\ntrial court to give a limiting instruction if so requested. 454\n\nThe Texas Rules recognize a partial exception to the general prohibition on hearsay for learned\ntreatises relied on by an expert witness. 455 Rule 803(18) states,\n\nTo the extent called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the\nexpert in direct examination, statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on\na subject of history, medicine, or other science or art established as a reliable authority by the testimony\nor admission of the witness or [*82] by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. If admitted, the\nstatements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits. 456\n\nOne Texas intermediate appellate court held the statements read into evidence pursuant to this Rule are\nafforded the same weight as live expert testimony and has considered them in reviewing reliability-based\nchallenges to expert testimony despite their exclusion from the jury room. 457 Thus, proponents of\nexpert opinions which rely on learned treatises should employ Rule 803’s limited hearsay exception\nfor learned treatises and have relevant portions read into evidence, even if the treatises cannot be\ntreated as exhibits when the jury retires to deliberate.\n\nRule 803(18) highlights the distinction between admitting predicate materials and including statements\nfrom those materials in the record. That Rule prohibits the admission of learned treatises as an exhibit\n451\n       The materials offered by the expert are hearsay if they are offered for the truth of the matters asserted in the material. But a party\ncould offer the materials for a nonhearsay basis: to demonstrate the predicate for the opinion. In that situation, they are offered only to\nshow what the expert relied on, not to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Thus, a trial judge might not admit the materials even for\nthis limited purpose under Rules 403 and 705(d). Tex. R. Evid. 403, 705(d).\n452\n      Fed. R. Evid. 703; Tex. R.

Commentary. Courts in many jurisdictions have declined to require an adequate basis and\nexplanation as a prerequisite to affording expert testimony evidentiary value, and even substantive\ncomplaints about the reliability of expert testimony cannot be raised for the first time in a\nlegal-sufficiency challenge in most jurisdictions. 458 Permitting legal-sufficiency attacks [*83] based\non the reliability of expert testimony, as Texas courts do, increases the burden on parties proffering\nexpert testimony in several ways. First, it gives the opposing party a second bite at the apple. An\nopposing party who has waived some or all challenges to the admissibility of expert evidence may still\nbe entitled to raise those challenges in a postverdict attack. With respect to reliability challenges the\nopposing party raised but did not prevail on at the Daubert hearing, the nonproffering party has an\nopportunity to further develop those challenges based on [*84] what occurred at the Daubert hearing\nand at trial.

Specifically,\ncourts in other jurisdictions presume that expert opinion evidence constitutes some evidence of the\nfacts as to which the expert opines - otherwise, the trial court should not have admitted the testimony\n- without looking below the surface of the opinion. Other types of evidence generally do not enjoy the\nsame presumption, even if admitted into evidence without objection. Nonexpert evidence may be\nlegally insufficient to support a jury finding when, for example, (1) it does not support the factual\nfinding under the circumstances of the case, even if it appears to support the finding on its face; 462\n(2) it is equally consistent with the absence of the fact it is offered to prove; 463 [*85] (3) it tends to\nprove the existence of damages in some amount but cannot support the amount of damages found; 464\n(4) it could create a question of fact if combined with other, additional evidence of the element for\nwhich it is offered, but it is not alone sufficient to create a question of fact; 465 or (5) the evidence is\nsubstantively defective. 466 There may be a well-founded justification for exempting expert evidence\nsuffering these same flaws from evidentiary review, but courts in other jurisdictions generally have not\narticulated justifications or otherwise specifically addressed the issue.

In other words, on the face of the record, the expert’s testimony was\n″if X, the defendant’s spray caused the injury; if not X, the defendant’s spray did not cause the injury.″ Since the uncontroverted record\nwas that X did not exist, the expert’s testimony was actually that the defendant’s spray did not cause the injury.

This Rule grants the proponent ″more flexibility in presenting such\ntestimony″ and allows ″the main point to be stated early.″ 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra note 187, § 7:23, at 909. Thus,\nRule 705 in effect puts the burden on the opponent. The wisdom of this approach rests on the notion that the price of requiring the\nfoundation to be laid first is simply too high, and obviously on the idea that the mechanism of cross is adequate to the task of exposing\n\f                                                                                                                          Page 68 of 230\n                                                        52 Hous.

It is implausible to suggest,\npost-Daubert, that parties will initially present less than their best expert evidence in the expectation\nof a second chance should their first try fail.″ 479\nCertainly Professor Goode and his co-authors are correct that Havner, Coastal Transport, Whirlpool,\nand Pollock have changed the landscape of error preservation for expert challenges. And certainly there\nare good arguments as to the wisdom of this shift.\n6. Potential Procedural Solutions. Unlike the rules governing the admissibility of expert evidence, the\nrules governing legal-sufficiency complaints were not designed for, and generally have not been\nspecifically tailored to, the complexities of modern expert evidence. Legal-sufficiency complaints can\nbe raised for the first time quite late in the trial proceedings - including after the judgment - and often\nare quite general. Thus, allowing no-evidence challenges to expert evidence can operate to deprive the\nproffering party of notice of the problem at a time when the proffering party might have been able to\nremedy it. When criticisms of expert evidence are raised and addressed in a Daubert hearing, for\nexample, the proffering party is put on notice of the complaint and has an opportunity to put additional\nsupport for an expert’s opinions into the record, to elicit supplemental explanation from a testifying\nexpert, or to demonstrate why the criticism is not well founded. When criticisms are raised for the first\ntime after the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, the proffering party has limited, if any, means of taking\nsuch corrective actions.\nAssuming Texas courts will continue to allow conclusory objections to be raised to expert testimony\nfor the first time postverdict, 480 one possible procedural solution to mitigate this [*89] rule’s potential\nharshness in civil cases 481 would be to permit trial courts to grant a new trial and courts of appeals\nto remand for a new trial, when a defendant 482 prevails on a legal-sufficiency challenge based on\ndefects in expert evidence not raised when, or before, the evidence was offered. This practice would\nbe consistent with the rules of civil and appellate procedure authorizing new trials, which authorize\ntrial courts to grant a new trial ″for good cause″ 483 and courts of appeals to remand for new trial when\n″the interest of justice″ requires it. 484\nWhile a legal-sufficiency challenge does not have to be raised before evidence is admitted at trial, it\ndoes have to be raised in the trial court in order to be preserved for appeal - through a motion for\nany flaws in the expert’s reasoning… . It is faith in the skill of trial counsel, the power of the cross, and the skepticism, common sense,\nand critical faculties of judges and juries, that underlie the conclusion that the exposure of weakness or fatal deficiencies in expert\ntestimony may be left to the calling party’s opponent.\n\nId. § 7:22, at 906-07.

In the latter instance, the\nplaintiff could be permitted to file a motion for new trial attaching new evidence tending to cure the\ndefect(s) in its expert evidence. Trial courts could be permitted to grant such motions if (1) the\nsuccessful no-evidence challenge was based on one or more deficiencies in the expert evidence that the\ndefendant had not raised when or before the [*90] evidence was offered; and (2) the plaintiff filed\nsupplemental evidence sufficient to cure the newly raised deficiencies in its expert evidence.\n\nGenerally, trial courts could decide such motions under the existing procedures for motions for new\ntrial, and courts of appeals could review trial courts’ decisions under the same abuse of discretion\nstandard generally applicable to motions for new trial, 487 except the ″newly discovered evidence″\nstandard would likely need to be more lenient. Currently, a party may seek a new trial on the basis of\nnewly discovered evidence if the party demonstrates that ″(1) the evidence has come to its knowledge\nsince the trial, (2) its failure to discover the evidence sooner was not due to lack of diligence, (3) the\nevidence is not cumulative, and (4) the evidence is so material it would probably produce a different\nresult if a new trial were granted.″ 488 A plaintiff could satisfy the third and fourth prongs by filing with\nthe motion new evidence that supplemented or buttressed the plaintiff’s expert evidence in a manner\nsufficient to convert it from ″no evidence″ to ″some evidence,″ assuming the defendant was not entitled\nto judgment on some other, independent basis. But under this approach, the first and second\nrequirements would need to be modified to permit the plaintiff to present evidence that was available\nto it at the time of trial but that was not necessary given the objections (or lack thereof) raised at that\ntime. The first prong could be modified to permit not only evidence that has come to the plaintiff’s\nknowledge since the trial, but also evidence responsive to objections to expert testimony that have\ncome to the plaintiff’s knowledge since the trial. The second prong could be satisfied not only by\nshowing that the plaintiff was diligent in discovering evidence but also by showing that the plaintiff\nwas diligent in responding to the defendant’s objections to the expert evidence raised before or at trial.\nThe motion for new trial in this context does more than give the trial court an opportunity to consider\nwhether the plaintiff’s supplemental evidence cures the deficiencies that render the expert evidence\nconclusory - it gives the plaintiff an opportunity to seek review of the trial court’s decision on appeal\nand to do so on the basis of a record that contains all of the evidence the plaintiff could have submitted\nto the trial court if the defendant’s complaints had been raised in a Daubert motion.\n485\n      Cecil v.

L. Rev. 1, *90\n\nThis approach addresses circumstances in which a trial court sustains a no-evidence attack, but not\ncircumstances in which a [*91] trial court denies a no-evidence challenge but the court of appeals\nsustains it. In that instance, we suggest that the rules of appellate procedure could be amended to\nauthorize a limited remand to the trial court when an appellate court holds, for the first time, that expert\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the judgment due to deficiencies in expert evidence that the\ndefendant did not raise until after the close of the plaintiff’s evidence. 489 The remand instructions to\nthe trial court could afford the plaintiff a limited opportunity to move for new trial on the basis of new\nevidence tending to cure the deficiencies in its expert evidence. The trial court could then grant or deny\nthe motion for new trial depending on whether the plaintiff had satisfied the four altered elements\ndiscussed above. If the trial court denied the motion for new trial, the trial court’s new judgment would\nbe appealable to the court of appeals, which would then review (under the abuse of discretion standard\ngenerally applicable to motions for new trial) only issues relating to the trial court’s decision(s) on\nremand, before the whole case could be brought before the Texas Supreme Court in a petition for\nreview. If the trial court granted the motion for new trial, such orders are now broadly subjected to\nmandamus review, 490 thus limiting the potential for a costly and time-consuming second trial when\nthe trial court incorrectly determines that the new evidence provides a legally sufficient foundation for\nthe expert’s opinion.\nOne shortcoming of the remand approach is that if the plaintiff is permitted to buttress the reliability\nof its expert testimony for the first time on remand, it is advantaged by the appellate court’s analysis\nof the issue - analysis the proffering party would not have in, say, a Daubert hearing. But the power\nto avoid providing that advantage to the proffering party rests in the hands of the opposing party, who\nmay simply raise his objections before or when the expert evidence is offered at trial.\nFinally, we note that Rule 703 permits an expert to rely on inadmissible facts or data in forming her\nopinion, as long as they are the kind of facts or data reasonably relied on by experts in the field, 491\nand Rule 104(a) permits trial courts to consider [*92] inadmissible evidence in ruling on expert\nchallenges. 492 In light of these rules and the justifications for them, we suggest that parties proffering\nexpert evidence should be permitted to put inadmissible evidence reasonably relied on by the expert\nbefore the court, even in the absence of an objection to admissibility. And courts should be permitted\nto consider inadmissible evidence reasonably relied on by experts when reviewing the legal sufficiency\nof expert evidence. Similarly, a party seeking a new trial under the standards discussed above should\nbe permitted to file inadmissible evidence in support of the motion. In short, the rules should permit\n489\n      Cf. Humble Sand & Gravel, Inc. v.

When a party seeks relief from a court on the basis of such materials, the party\nshould, of course, retain the burden of drawing the court’s attention to the specific materials that\nsupport the relief requested.\n\nWe recognize that some Texas courts of appeals have indicated that inadmissible evidence generally\nmay not be considered in a legal-sufficiency review. 493 But the Texas Supreme Court has not expressly\nadopted this rule, and whatever the validity of the rule outside the context of expert evidence, it cannot\nbe strictly applied to legal-sufficiency challenges to the reliability of the basis for an expert’s opinion\n- Rule 703 expressly permits an opinion to be based on inadmissible evidence by the rules of evidence.\n494\n    The Texas [*93] Supreme Court’s legal-sufficiency reviews in expert-evidence cases seem to be\nin accord. The epidemiological and animal studies at issue in Havner, for example, would presumably\nhave been inadmissible hearsay if offered independently of expert testimony. 495 Thus, under our\nproposal, those studies could be considered in a legal-sufficiency review.\n\nDoubtless, these potential procedures add complications to the current procedure in civil cases,\nparticularly the advent of a limited remand to consider a new trial. But they are attempts to develop\na middle ground between the two extremes. There may be other, better, or equally workable solutions\nout there. We suggest only that a middle ground is worthy of consideration, in light of the unique nature\nof Texas’s legal-sufficiency review of expert evidence. In our view, courts should explore - including\nthrough amendments to the rules of procedure - a less harsh means of dealing with such no-evidence\nchallenges than automatically rendering judgment against a proffering party who was not put on notice\nof any issue by an objection and who perhaps could have, and would have, cured the objectionable\naspect of its expert evidence if given the opportunity. An automatic remand for new trial, on the other\nhand, would create an unnecessary waste of judicial resources when the conclusory or speculative\nnature of expert evidence could not be cured. A procedural practice that affords proponents of expert\ntestimony an opportunity to meet criticisms of the testimony after they are raised - including when the\ncriticism is couched as a ″no evidence″ complaint and raised for the first time postverdict - is the most\npractical compromise between the two.\n\n\n493\n      See supra note 472.\n494\n         Tex.

It could be argued that looking beyond the testimony to determine\nthe reliability of scientific evidence is incompatible with our no evidence standard of review. If a reviewing court is to consider the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the argument runs, a court should not look beyond the expert’s testimony to determine\nif it is reliable. But such an argument is too simplistic. It reduces the no evidence standard of review to a meaningless exercise of looking\nto see only what words appear in the transcript of the testimony, not whether there is in fact some evidence.″).

Indeed, Havner reviewed the\narticles cited by the plaintiffs’ experts. Id. at 724.\n495\n      Havner and its legal-sufficiency analysis are discussed in detail at supra notes 252-71 and accompanying text.

But juries and scientists draw from\ntwo decidedly different pools of evidence. The scientific approach invites consideration of all available\ninformation, including information that is incomplete, flawed, or of questionable reliability, with the\nscientist discerning what weight to afford each piece of information in light of any shortcomings. 497\nA jury, by contrast, [*94] may consider only the evidence admitted by the court - information that is\nnarrowly tailored to the issues in the case, having been filtered by a myriad of rules and procedures\ndesigned to eliminate anything that is irrelevant, misleading, unreliable, or excessively prejudicial. 498\nOne explanation for these inverse approaches can be found in the different roles of scientists and\njurors. In the context of her own work, the scientist acts as both judge and jury, deciding what\ninformation to consider, what purposes to consider it for, how much weight to give it, and the ultimate\nimport of all the information. This role reflects general perceptions of scientific research. The\nconsumer of information in this context is an expert in the field who is well suited to evaluate the\nrelative reliability and relevance of various pieces of information. The method of information\nprocessing used, the scientific method, is designed to neutralize passions and prejudices in the\nevaluation of information. And the peer-review process and the evolutionary nature of scientific\nresearch enable identification and correction of biases, design defects, or analytical flaws, on an\nongoing basis.\nIn the courtroom, the judge acts as arbiter of what facts and opinions are appropriate for juror\nconsumption, while jurors generally decide what weight to give the information and the ultimate\nimport of conflicting information. 499 The juror’s role reflects general perceptions of the courtroom.\nJurors generally are not experts in the law, nor in the field about which an expert witness testifies. The\nlaw does not presume jurors are well suited to decipher the legally relevant from the legally irrelevant\n500\n    or [*95] the scientifically reliable from the scientifically unreliable, 501 nor does it presume they\nare dispassionate in their evaluation of information. 502 The informational predicate for a judgment\ngenerally reflects a snapshot in time - the legal community is not afforded an opportunity to reassess\n496\n      The 1999 article identifies this gate as ″foundational reliability.″ See Brown, supra note 1, at 811-12. Because courts have come\nto use the term ″foundational″ to refer collectively to the type of reliability discussed here as well as ″methodological reliability″ and\n″connective reliability,″ we have renamed this gate ″predicative reliability″ for greater clarity.\n497\n      See infra Part III.B.1.b (discussing this ″weight of the evidence″ approach).\n498\n      See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 401-15 (relevance and prejudice); id. 601-15 (witness reliability); id. 701-06 (reliability of opinion\ntestimony); id. 801-07 (hearsay); id. 901-1008 (reliability of nontestimonial evidence).\nLegal scholars take different views as to the best unifying principle through which to view the rules of evidence. Some advocate a ″jury\ncontrol″ principle, viewing the rules of evidence as designed to prevent juries from affording undue weight to particular kinds of\nevidence; others, a ″best evidence″ principle, viewing the rules as designed to prefer use of the best evidence available, permitting use\nof lesser evidence when the best evidence is unavailable; and still others, a ″worst evidence″ principle, viewing the rules as designed\nto prevent, deter, and expose perjury by witnesses. Compare Edward J. Imwinkelried, The Worst Evidence Principle: The Best\nHypothesis as to the Logical Structure of Evidence Law, 46 U. Miami L. Rev. 1069, 1072 (1992) (advocating the ″worst evidence″\nprinciple and discussing the ″jury control″ principle), with Dale A. Nance, The Best Evidence Principle, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 227, 293 (1988)\n(advocating the ″best evidence″ principle). The courts’ construction and application of Rule 702 could likewise be viewed through these\nparadigms. Fear of perjury by paid experts, in particular, seems to be a motivating factor in judicial review of expert evidence, if typically\nan unspoken one.\n499\n      See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 103.\n500\n      Fed. R. Evid. 401-02 (admissibility of relevant evidence).\n\f                                                                                                                            Page 73 of 230\n                                                         52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *95\n\nand modify the facts on which a judgment was based when new developments come to light. 503 And\nexpert testimony in the courtroom is not subject to traditional peer review (although the predicative\nmaterials on which the expert relies may have been). The absence of these safeguards is exacerbated\nby the fact that experts providing scientific evidence in a courtroom are subject to greater bias\nprovocations, particularly ″adversarial bias,″ than scientists in the field. 504\n\nBecause of the differences in how evidence is used, a tension arises when an expert brings opinions\nbased on such evidence to the courtroom. Under the old Frye test, this tension was resolved in\ndeference to the judgment of the scientific community: an expert’s opinion was admissible if the theory\nunderlying the [*96] opinion had achieved ″general acceptance″ in the expert’s field. 505 The barrier\nto entry was high, 506 but trial judges did not review the factual assumptions, data collections, studies,\nand opinions on which testifying experts relied in reaching their conclusion to ensure certain standards\nof reliability were satisfied, as they would if the evidence were offered in a judicial proceeding. 507 The\nmodern evidentiary regime for expert testimony, ushered in by Daubert and its progeny, 508 shifted\nmuch of the ″gatekeeping″ responsibility from the scientific community at large to the trial judge. 509\n501\n      Fed. R. Evid. 702-03 (admissibility of expert witness testimony).\n502\n      See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 402 (requiring trial courts to filter out irrelevant evidence); id. 403 (requiring trial courts to filter out\nevidence that is relevant but more prejudicial than probative).\n503\n      The Supreme Court observed in Daubert:\n\nThere are important differences between the quest for truth in the courtroom and the quest for truth in the laboratory. Scientific\nconclusions are subject to perpetual revision. Law, on the other hand, must resolve disputes finally and quickly. The scientific project\nis advanced by broad and wide-ranging consideration of a multitude of hypotheses, for those that are incorrect will eventually be shown\nto be so, and that in itself is an advance. Conjectures that are probably wrong are of little use, however, in the project of reaching a quick,\nfinal, and binding legal judgment - often of great consequence - about a particular set of events in the past. We recognize that, in practice,\na gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how flexible, inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights\nand innovations. That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic\nunderstanding but for the particularized resolution of legal disputes.\n\nDaubert v.

L. Rev. 1, *99\n\n1. Challenging Predicative Reliability. In endeavoring to demonstrate that an expert’s opinions are\nsupported by a reliable predicate - i.e., ″an adequate foundation of relevant facts, data, or opinions,″\n528\n    - a proffering party must bear in mind a number of key considerations. First, the predicate must be\nadequate in two ways: it must be reliable in and of itself and it must actually support the opinions\nreached by the expert. 529 Second, in Texas courts, the adequacy of the predicate must be proved up\nin a manner that will withstand attack not only in a preadmission Daubert hearing but also in a\npostjudgment legal-sufficiency review. 530 Third, unlike the old Frye test, what is considered adequate\nsupport for an opinion in the scientific community may not be considered adequate support for an\nopinion in a courtroom. 531 We discuss each of these requirements below.\n\na. Components of Predicative Reliability. The predicative reliability requirement originates in the\nSupreme Court’s recognition in Daubert that expert opinions must rest ″on a reliable foundation.″ 532\nThe Court expanded on this requirement in Joiner, affirming the trial court’s decision to exclude expert\ntestimony because the animal and epidemiological studies on which the experts relied did not provide\nsufficient support for the experts’ conclusions that the plaintiff’s exposure to PCBs caused his cancer.\n533\n    Five months before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Joiner, the Texas Supreme Court\nconducted a similar review in Havner, when it concluded that the epidemiological and animal studies\non which the plaintiffs’ experts relied did not provide adequate support for their conclusion that\nBendectin caused the plaintiffs’ daughter’s birth [*100] defects. 534 Under Havner, ″if the foundational\ndata underlying opinion testimony are unreliable, an expert will not be permitted to base an opinion\non that data because any opinion drawn from that data is likewise unreliable.″ 535 The Havner Court\nalso instructed that the epidemiological studies on which the plaintiffs’ experts relied provided a\nreliable predicate for the experts’ opinions only if they were soundly designed and executed and\nactually supported the experts’ conclusions. 536\n\nThe predicative reliability gate thus has two principal components: (1) the predicate itself must be\nreliable (which we call ″predicative soundness″); and (2) the predicate must actually support the\nexpert’s opinion (which we call ″predicative probativeness″). 537 While the first prong relates to the\nquality of an expert’s predicate, the second prong relates to the probative value, if any, the predicate\naffords the expert’s opinion. The second prong is particularly important in Texas, where it is the basis\n527\n      Gen. Elec. Co. v.

Predicative Soundness. When an expert bases his opinion on the scientific data, studies, or\nanalysis of others, the reliability of the underlying material is vital to the reliability of the expert’s\nconclusions - expert opinions predicated on untrustworthy information are themselves untrustworthy.\n″While an expert’s data need not be admissible, the data cannot be derived from a manifestly unreliable\nsource.″ 541 Essentially, when an expert’s analysis is based on the work of others, the underlying work\nis subject to the same tests for reliability as the expert’s own work and conclusions. 542 Analysis of the\nfirst component of predicative reliability, predicative soundness, thus may mirror the kind of analysis\nthat takes place at the methodological reliability and connective reliability gates except that, rather than\nexamining the methodology, accuracy, and reasoning of a testifying expert’s own analysis and\nopinions, the court must examine the methodology, accuracy, and reasoning employed by the experts\n\n538\n      As used by the Texas Supreme Court, the term ″basis″ generally includes all components of reliability: the predicate for an expert’s\nopinion, the methodology the expert uses, and the reasoning the expert employs to extract opinions from the results, if any extraction\nis necessary.

When predicative materials directly support an expert’s\nopinions based on them, there is no gap and connective reliability does not come into play. Similarly,\nwhen the predicative materials do not provide any support for the expert’s opinion, the two cannot be\nbridged together at all.

One dichotomy that has arisen in reviewing the reliability\nof an expert opinion is between the ″weight of the evidence″ approach, in which a court considers all\nof the expert’s predicative materials collectively to determine whether they provide a reliable basis for\nthe expert’s conclusion, and a more ″granular″ or ″atomized″ approach, in which a court considers each\nof the predicative materials on which the expert relies individually to determine whether it provides\nreliable support for the expert’s conclusions.\nThe Supreme Court’s connective reliability review in Joiner has been described as ″strikingly\natomized.″ 560 The Court reviewed the reliability of each of the experts’ underlying materials on an\nindividual basis. First, the Court rejected the experts’ reliance on animal studies performed on infant\nmice injected with massive doses of PCBs as too ″far-removed″ from the plaintiff’s environmental\nexposure to significantly smaller doses as an adult human. 561 Then the Court reviewed and rejected,\none-by-one, the experts’ reliance on four epidemiological studies. 562 The Court’s ultimate conclusion\n- that the studies ″were not sufficient, whether individually or in combination, to support [the experts’]\nconclusions″ 563 - leaves room for a more holistic approach, but rightly or wrongly, the Joiner opinion\nlargely has been construed as endorsing a granulated review of predicative expert materials. 564\n\n557\n      See infra Part III.D.\n558\n      See Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 818.\n559\n      See infra Part III.D.\n560\n      Jennifer L.

A plaintiff cannot prove causation by presenting different types of unreliable evidence.″ 572\nThe authors of the relevant chapter of the Federal Judicial Center’s (FJC) Reference Manual on\nScientific Evidence, on the other hand, favor a more holistic approach.

The comment to the Restatement states:\nSome courts [have] tried to develop bright-line rules based on science for adequate proof of factual causation. The high-water mark for\nthis overreliance on scientific thresholds occurred in the Bendectin litigation when one court announced a blanket rule that a plaintiff\ncould not make out a sufficient case without statistically significant epidemiologic evidence.\nThese courts may be relying on a view that ″science″ presents an ″objective″ method of establishing that, in all cases, reasonable minds\ncannot differ on the issue of factual causation. Such a view is incorrect. First, scientific standards for the sufficiency of evidence to\nestablish a proposition may be inappropriate for the law, which itself must decide the minimum amount of evidence permitting a\nreasonable (and, therefore, permissible) inference, as opposed to speculation that is not permitted. Second, scientists report that an\nevaluation of data and scientific evidence to determine whether an inference of causation is appropriate requires judgment and\ninterpretation. Scientists are subject to their own value judgments and preexisting biases that may affect their view of a body of evidence.\nThere are instances in which although one scientist or group of scientists comes to one conclusion about factual causation, they recognize\nthat another group that comes to a contrary conclusion might still be ″reasonable.″\nId.

Therefore, only the plaintiff’s expert evidence on general causation (i.e., whether benzene was\ncapable of causing APL) was at issue; specific causation (i.e., whether benzene caused the plaintiff’s\nAPL) was not at issue. 586 The plaintiff’s expert had applied a ″weight of the evidence″ methodology\nto conclude that benzene was capable of causing APL. 587 The Milward court described the ″weight\nof the evidence″ approach as ″a mode of logical reasoning often described as ″inference to the best\nexplanation,’ in which the conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises.″ 588 ″In this mode of\nreasoning,″ the court acknowledged, ″the use of scientific judgment is necessary″; there is ″no\nalgorithm″ for determining ″whether an association truly reflects a causal relationship or is spurious″;\nand ″scientists may come to different judgments about whether such an inference is appropriate.″ 589\nThe court concluded that ″the fact that the role of judgment in the weight of the evidence approach is\nmore readily apparent than it is in other methodologies does not mean that the approach is any less\nscientific.″ 590\nOf course, the dispute among legal practitioners and commentators is not over whether experts should\napply a ″weight of the evidence″ approach to their scientific analysis outside the courtroom - it is a\ncommon and widely accepted scientific practice. 591 The dispute is over whether courts should admit\nan expert opinion based on the cumulative weight of the evidence when none of the individual pieces\nof evidence provides legally probative support for the expert’s opinion. The Milward court did more\nthan just hold that testifying experts can rely on a ″weight of the evidence″ methodology in their\nanalysis; it held that the district court erred by\ntreating the separate evidentiary components of [the expert’s] analysis atomistically, as though his\nultimate opinion was independently supported by each… .

The Supreme\nCourt of Appeals of West Virginia cited Milward extensively in holding that a trial court overstepped its gatekeeper function in excluding\nall of the plaintiff’s causation experts. See id. at 289, 301-02, 306. But while the court sanctioned the experts’ reliance on a ″weight of\nthe evidence″ approach in reaching his conclusion, the court did not expressly apply a ″weight of the evidence″ approach (or any\napproach) to review the studies and data on which the expert relied in reaching his conclusion. See id. at 296-97. The Eighth Circuit has\ncited to Milward, but not to the part of the opinion that endorses a ″weight of the evidence″ review. See Kuhn v.

Applying this test, the court\ndetermined that the following five categories of evidence relied on by the plaintiff’s expert provided a ″scientifically sound and\nmethodologically reliable foundation.″ Id. at 20. The five categories of predicative evidence included: (1) ″the near-consensus among\ngovernmental agencies, experts, and active researchers in the field that benzene can cause [Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)],″ the\nclassification of leukemia that includes APL; (2) evidence that all types of AML derive from the same origin - genetically damaged\npluripotent stem cells - from which the expert concluded that all AMLs, including APL, have a common etiology; (3) ″toxicology studies\nestablishing that metabolites of benzene cause significant chromosomal damage at the stem cell level in the bone marrow - the type of\ndamage that is known to cause APL and other types of AML″; (4) two sets of studies indicating that benzene metabolites act as catalytic\ninhibitors of a cellular enzyme, ″topo II,″ that ″is essential for the maintenance of proper chromosome structure and segregation,″ which\nthe expert relied on as evidencing ″a known biological mechanism by which exposure to benzene could cause APL″; and (5) a small set\nof epidemiological studies showing ″an increased risk factor for APL, which although not statistically significant was consistent with\ncausality, and provided no grounds for concluding otherwise.″ Id. at 18-20. As these categories of evidence demonstrate, much of the\nanalysis of the reliability of the expert’s conclusion depended not on predicative reliability but on connective reliability - i.e., whether\nthe expert had demonstrated a reliable basis for extrapolating from evidence relating to causation of AMLs generally to reach a\nconclusion on causation of APL specifically and whether the expert had demonstrated a reliable basis for extrapolating from evidence\nrelating to inhibition of topo II and the chromosomal translocation seen in APL. See infra Part III.D., for a thorough discussion of\nconnective reliability. A principal difference between the district court’s analysis (which led to exclusion of the expert testimony) and\nthe circuit court’s analysis (which led to admission of the testimony) was that the circuit court determined that the expert adequately\nbridged these gaps and the district court reached the opposite conclusion.

L. Rev. 1, *111\n\n [*111]\n2. Developments in Specific Categories of Predicates. As with the other reliability gates, the analysis\nof whether an expert’s opinion is founded on an adequate predicate necessarily differs from one\ncontext to the next. 596 Rule 702 lists three broad categories of expert testimony: scientific knowledge,\ntechnical knowledge, or other specialized knowledge. 597 The inquiry into whether an expert has\nprovided an adequate predicate for her opinion is determined on a case-by-case basis. 598 But within\nRule 702’s three categories of ″knowledge,″ certain types of predicates appear over and over in recent\ncase law. As a result, certain recurring themes and baselines have developed in the jurisprudence for\nassessing specific types of expert predicates within these categories of expertise. It is important to note\nthat while some predicative data, studies, facts, or assumptions may be inherently unreliable because\nthey are inherently unsound or lacking in quality, much predicative material is reliable for some\npurposes but not others. 599\n\n [*112]\n\na. Scientific Predicates. Expert evidence based on ″scientific″ knowledge 600 is perhaps the\nquintessential expert evidence. It is perhaps most often used to establish the element of causation in\ntort cases, particularly in toxic tort cases. 601 The trilogy of U.S. Supreme Court cases that form the\nbasis for judicial screening of expert testimony - Daubert, Joiner, and Kumho - all address expert\nopinions on causation in tort cases. 602 Daubert and Joiner were both toxic tort cases. 603 As the body\nof case law in this area has developed, so has the science. Courts are increasingly sophisticated in their\nanalysis of scientific evidence, particularly in the area of toxic torts, where specific causation issues\nrecur in multiple cases across multiple jurisdictions. In this section, we examine certain types of\npredicative material that experts commonly rely on in litigation involving scientific expert evidence.\nclear whether the circuit court would have admitted expert testimony supported only by that evidence and epidemiological evidence that\n″concededly lacked statistical significance.″ Id. at 25.\n596\n      See, e.g., Daniel J.

L. Rev. 1, *112\n\ni. Specific v. General Causation. Before delving into this area of law, it is important to distinguish\nbetween two types of causation evidence in toxic tort cases. In these cases, courts generally require a\nclaimant to prove through scientific expert evidence that the toxic substance at issue is capable of\ncausing the type of injury suffered by the claimant (general causation) and that the toxic substance at\nissue actually caused the claimant’s injury (specific causation). 604 Courts generally examine whether\na toxic tort claimant has provided adequate evidence of general causation before reaching the issue of\nspecific causation. 605 When science has not yet developed direct evidence [*113] that a particular\nsubstance causes a particular injury, experts in toxic tort cases often rely on epidemiological studies\nand animal studies as indirect evidence of general causation. 606 Evidence of specific causation in a\ntoxic tort case is typically more direct. Once general causation is established, a claimant’s treating\nphysician, or another physician who has reviewed the claimant’s medical records, often will opine that\nthe claimant’s injury was caused by his exposure to the toxic chemical based on a ″differential\ndiagnosis″ technique. 607\n\nii. Epidemiological Studies. Epidemiology is the ″basic science of disease prevention.″ 608 Epidemiology\nendeavors to identify environmental (and, more recently, genetic) risk factors for disease and to offer\ninsights into the mechanisms involved in the origin of different diseases, as a first step in developing\napproaches to prevention. 609 Epidemiological investigation of disease pathogenesis (the mechanism\nthat causes a disease) can be divided into two steps: first, a statistical analysis of collected data to\ndetermine if a scientifically valid association exists between an agent and a disease; second, if a valid\nassociation exists, a determination of what conclusions (including conclusions about causation) can be\nderived from the data. 610 In the first step, associations are assessed in terms of several important\nconsiderations including: the relative risk, the confidence interval, and the quality of information. 611\nRelative risk measures how much more likely a person exposed to a particular substance is to contract\na particular disease than is an unexposed person. 612 ″A confidence interval provides both the relative\nrisk (or other risk measure) found in the study and a range (interval) within which the risk likely would\n\n\n604\n       See, e.g., Pluck v.

Frequently,\nindividual epidemiological studies find an association in the first step of the process but are not able\nto make determinations of causation based on that association alone. 623 Courts are careful to observe\nthat, although evidence of association can tend to show causation, association and causation are not\nlegally equivalent. 624 Courts have been particularly critical of epidemiological studies when there are\nother plausible causes that are not discounted and the connection between exposure and the disease is\nmerely temporal. 625 With respect to the latter, courts have invoked the logical fallacy of post hoc ergo\npropter hoc, observing that causation cannot be presumed merely because the disease or its symptoms\nfollow the exposure. 626\n\n [*116] The issue in Daubert was the admissibility of the expert opinion testimony that the drug\nBendectin caused certain birth defects. 627 After rejecting Frye’s ″general acceptance″ test in favor of\nRule 702’s relevancy and reliability requirements, 628 the Daubert Court remanded the case for\napplication of the new framework for determining the admissibility of expert evidence. 629 On remand,\nthe Daubert II court excluded opinion testimony that Bendectin caused the birth defects from experts\nrelying on three categories of predicates: epidemiological studies, animal studies, and the chemical\nstructure of Bendectin, as compared to that of other drugs suspected of causing birth defects. 630 With\nregard to the epidemiological studies, the Daubert II court held that, for an epidemiological study to\nshow causation under a preponderance of the evidence standard, it would have to demonstrate a\nrelative risk of at least 2.0 - i.e., that birth defects were twice as likely among mothers who took\n\n622\n       See Norris v.

First, the\nstudies themselves must have been conducted using ″sound methodology.″ 635 The Havner Court\ninstructed Texas courts to examine the design and execution of [*117] the epidemiological studies,\nespecially for bias. 636 Second, the Court held that the studies must demonstrate relative risk of more\nthan 2.0 - i.e., more than a ″doubling of the risk″ - which the Court linked to the ″more likely than not″\nstandard of proof applicable to causation. 637 The Court cautioned that a relative risk of more than 2.0\nwas not ″a litmus test,″ and that even a high relative risk does not necessarily prove a causal\nrelationship. 638 The Court expressly declined to decide ″whether epidemiological evidence with a\nrelative risk of less than 2.0, coupled with other credible and reliable evidence, may be legally\nsufficient to support causation.″ 639 Finally, the Court noted the particular importance of replication in\nepidemiology, 640 and stated that ″an isolated study finding statistically significant association between\nBendectin and [the birth] defects would not be legally sufficient evidence of causation.″ 641\nHavner’s conclusion must be considered in context.

The court stated,\n\nCalifornia tort law requires plaintiffs to show not merely that Bendectin increased the likelihood of injury, but that it more likely than\nnot caused their injuries. In terms of statistical proof, this means that plaintiffs must establish not just that their mothers’ ingestion of\nBendectin increased somewhat the likelihood of birth defects, but that it more than doubled it - only then can it be said that Bendectin\nis more likely than not the source of their injury.\n\nId. at 1320 (citation omitted).\n632\n      Id. at 1321.\n633\n      Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v.

Garza, the plaintiffs argued that Havner’s requirement of at least two\nepidemiological studies demonstrating at least a ″doubling of the risk″ did not apply to clinical trials\nor, if the requirement did apply to clinical trials, it was not a bright-line rule. 646 The Texas Supreme\nCourt rejected these arguments and ″reiterated that when parties attempt to prove general causation\nusing epidemiological evidence, a threshold requirement of reliability is that the evidence demonstrate\na statistically significant doubling of the risk.″ 647 With respect to the difference between observational\nand experimental epidemiological studies, the Court stated:\n\nWhile the controlled, experimental, and prospective nature of clinical trials undoubtedly makes them\nmore reliable than retroactive, observational studies, both must show a statistically significant doubling\nof the risk in order to be some evidence that a drug more likely than not caused a particular injury. The\nsuperior way in which a study is conducted does not justify taking its conclusion to be anything other\nthan what it is. 648\n\nOn this basis, the Court concluded that the requirements identified in Havner ″necessarily apply to all\nepidemiological evidence.″ 649\n\nAlthough the Merck Court decided the case on the basis of general causation without reaching the\nplaintiffs’ specific causation evidence, the plaintiffs in that case presented separate evidence of specific\ncausation. 650 The Court could have distinguished Havner on this basis, because the plaintiffs in\nHavner relied exclusively on epidemiological evidence and animal [*119] studies to establish both\n642\n    As noted above, because they are controlled and prospective, randomized clinical trials are more reliable than observational studies.\nMerck & Co. v.

In In re Bextra and Celebrex Marketing\nSales Practices and Product Liability Litigation, the district court for the Northern District of California\ndistinguished Daubert II (on which the Havner Court relied in adopting the ″doubling of the risk″\nstandard 652) on this basis, stating that a relative risk of greater than 2.0 is necessary for\nepidemiological studies to be probative of specific causation but the same analysis does not apply\nwhen epidemiological evidence is relied on only to show general causation. 653 The district court for\nthe Central District of California reached the same conclusion in In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants\nProducts Liability Litigation, 654 as have several other federal district courts. 655 The Superior Court\nof Delaware likewise distinguished between general and specific causation, indicating that requiring\na relative risk of 2.0 ″makes sense″ in the context of specific causation, in which the plaintiff must\nshow that the substance in question ″more likely than not″ caused the injury in question. 656 But when\nepidemiological evidence ″is offered to support general causation, whether the exposure could cause\nharm at all, a less stringent standard is, by definition, weaker but potentially probative.″ 657\n\nBut in Merck, the Texas Supreme Court applied the ″doubling of the risk″ requirement for\nepidemiological evidence without regard to whether there was separate, reliable evidence [*120] of\nspecific causation. 658 And since Merck, the Court has continued to state the Havner requirements as\nabsolutes for epidemiological evidence. 659 Even under Borg-Warner Corp. v. Flores and Bostic v.\nGeorgia-Pacific Corp., in which the Court lightened, to some degree, the burden of proving causation\nin multi-defendant asbestos-related suits, the Texas Supreme Court strictly adhered to the Havner\nstandards for epidemiological evidence. 660 In light of the Texas Supreme Court’s unequivocal\nstatements in Merck, epidemiological evidence demonstrating a relative risk of less than 2.0 is\nprobably not admissible to show either specific or general causation in Texas courts. 661\n651\n       See Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v.

L. Rev. 1, *121\n\nIt is also important to distinguish the ″doubling of the risk″ standard from a ″doubling dose″ standard\nadvocated in some cases. In In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litigation, the Ninth Circuit rejected\nan argument that, under Daubert II, parties claiming that exposure to radiation had caused their\nillnesses had to ″demonstrate that they had been exposed to a specific dose of radiation that statistically\n″doubled their risk’ of harm″ to establish general causation. 669 The court observed that this argument\nblurred the lines between general and specific causation, 670 noting: ″It is critical to stress that the\nplaintiffs in Daubert II had no scientific evidence that Bendectin was capable of causing birth defects\n(generic causation), and therefore were [*122] required to produce epidemiological studies to prove\nthat Bendectin more likely than not caused their own particularized injuries (individual causation).″ 671\nIn Hanford Nuclear, by contrast, general causation was not truly questioned, and the issue was one of\nspecific causation. 672 The court concluded that in that context it was error for the district court to\nrequire evidence that the claimants were exposed to a ″doubling dose″ of radiation without regard to\nindividual risk factors such as heredity. 673\n\nIt is not clear whether the Ninth Circuit’s distinction between ″doubling of the risk″ and ″doubling\ndose″ is viable under Texas law. 674 It is equally true in Texas that evidence of specific causation must\naccount for the relevant characteristics of the claimant in the case, such as medical history and genetic\ndisposition. 675 This would mean that once a claimant proffers reliable evidence of general causation,\nhe must demonstrate that the substance at issue more likely than not caused his injury in light of actual\ncircumstances, not that he was exposed to the dosage necessary to double the risk of injury under some\ngeneric set of circumstances. 676 And Havner reached largely the same result as Daubert II, under\nlargely the same circumstances - the experts relied on the disputed epidemiological evidence to support\nconclusions on both general and specific causation. 677 Thus, the Texas Supreme Court could\ndistinguish Havner in the same way that the Ninth Circuit distinguished Daubert II. But, as noted\nabove, the Texas Supreme Court applied the Havner standard in Merck without distinction, even\nthough the plaintiffs in Merck presented separate evidence of specific causation. 678\n\nIn a 2011 workplace radiation case, the Fifth Circuit relied on the standards for expert causation\nevidence articulated in Havner, concluding that the plaintiffs’ evidence failed as a matter of law\n669\n      In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777932\"><a href=\"/opinion/777932/in-re-hanford-nuclear-reservation-litigation-jeanne-jaros-on-their-own/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1130 (9th Cir. 2002).\n670\n      Id. at 1134-35.\n671\n      Id. at 1136-37.\n672\n       Claimants in the case alleged that their illness was caused by radiation emitted by a local nuclear power plant.

In comment a, the Restatement states,\n\nThe word ″substantial″ is used to denote the fact that the defendant’s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead\nreasonable men to regard it as a cause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility, rather\nthan in the so-called ″philosophic sense,″ which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would\nnot have occurred.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 431 cmt. a (1965).

The Court had a six-member majority on this holding, including the five justices who joined the\nmajority opinion in its entirety and the one concurring justice.\n693\n       Id. at 6 (″We follow Flores and conclude that in products liability cases where the plaintiff was exposed to multiple sources of\nasbestos, substantial factor causation is the appropriate basic standard of causation without including as a separate requirement that the\nplaintiff meet a strict but for causation test.″). The Court had the same six-member majority on this holding. In support of this holding,\nthe Court observed,\n\nDue to the nature of the disease process, which can occur over decades and involve multiple sources of exposure, establishing which\nfibers from which defendant actually caused the disease is not always humanly possible. Even if the exposure from a particular defendant\nwas by itself sufficient to cause the disease, in multiple-exposure cases the plaintiff may find it impossible to show that he would not\nhave become ill but for the exposure from that defendant.\n\nId.\n\nThe Bostic Court indicated that this outcome was dictated by Flores, stating that ″the absence of but for language in Flores was not\ninadvertent.″ Id. at 7. But as noted above, Flores did quote the ″without which″ language from the Restatement, supra note 688, and in\nfact, the Bostic Court quoted this language from Flores at the outset of the opinion. Id. at 1. Regardless, the Bostic Court rejected any\nbut-for requirement in multi-exposure, asbestos-related toxic tort actions, and surmised that the Restatement’s authors would agree: ″We\ndo not think the Restatements, in their attempts to synthesize many decades of tort law, would require the plaintiffs to meet a strict but\nfor causation test in a case like today’s case.″ Id. at 8.\nThe Restatement (Third) of Torts: Physical & Emotional Harm reformulates the causation standard. As noted above, the Restatement\n(Second) of Torts requires ″legal cause,″ which it defines to include both the substantial factor and but-for causation elements.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 431(a), (b), cmt. a. The Restatement (Third) separates these two causal elements into ″factual cause,″\nwhich is but-for causation, see Restatement (Third) of Torts: Physical & Emotional Harm § 26 (2005) (″Conduct is the factual cause of\nharm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct.″), and the ″scope of liability (proximate cause),″ which is somewhat\nsimilar to Texas’s foreseeability element of causation, see id. § 29 (″An actor’s liability is limited to harms that result from the risks that\nmade the actor’s conduct tortious.″). Unlike its predecessor, the Restatement (Third) includes two sections that expressly address the\napplication of the but-for causation requirement in the context of harms caused by multiple actors. First, under section 27, when multiple\nacts occur, each of which would have been a but-for cause of the harm individually, each act is considered a factual cause. Id. § 27\n(″multiple sufficient causes″). A common example of this scenario is when two defendants fatally shot the plaintiff at the same time. Each\ndefendant could argue that his own shot was not a but-for cause of the plaintiff’s death because the other shot would have killed the\nplaintiff. Section 27 treats both defendants as the but-for cause of the plaintiff’s death. Second, under section 28(b), when a plaintiff\nproves that multiple actors engaged in tortious conduct, one or more of which caused the plaintiff’s injury, if the plaintiff cannot\nreasonably be expected to prove which actor or actors caused the harm, the burden of proof shifts to the defendants.

The Bostics’ specific causation expert ″made no attempt to measure Bostic’s actual aggregate\ndose assignable to Georgia-Pacific or any other source.″ 701 The Court held that ″proof of substantial\nfactor causation requires some quantification of the dose resulting from Bostic’s exposure to\n\n\n\n\ncomments indicate that section 28(b) was drafted with toxic tort cases in mind.

The dissent argued that causation in a multi-defendant toxic tort\ncase involved three inquiries - general causation, specific causation, and substantial factor causation -\nand that the majority ″improperly applied Havner to answer all three questions.″ 704 By doing so, the\ndissent asserted, the Court ″effectively rendered Havner the exclusive measure of proof in toxic tort\ncases,″ in direct conflict with Havner’s ″affirmation that a plaintiff is always free to prove his case by\n″direct, scientifically reliable proof of causation.’″ 705 The dissent concluded that the Bostics had put\nforth such ″direct, scientifically reliable proof″ of both specific and general causation (i.e., that\nasbestos can cause mesothelioma and that asbestos did in fact cause Timothy Bostic’s mesothelioma)\nand thus should not have to satisfy Havner to prove substantial factor causation (i.e., that asbestos from\nGeorgia-Pacific’s product was a substantial cause of his mesothelioma). 706 The dissenting justices\ngenerally agreed with the majority that the determination of whether a particular defendant’s product\nwas a substantial cause of a plaintiff’s disease should be based on evidence relating to the plaintiff’s\naggregate exposure relative to the plaintiff’s exposure to the particular defendant’s products. 707 But\nthey disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that the Bostics had failed to offer any dose-quantifying\nevidence, relying on evidence of ″the approximate quantum of time Timothy was exposed to″\nGeorgia-Pacific’s product. 708\n\nRegardless of whether the majority or the dissent in Bostic has the better argument as to whether the\nBostics presented [*128] adequate ″direct″ evidence of causation, the dissent presents a strong\nargument that Havner’s doubling-of-the-risk requirement does not apply to defendant-specific\n702\n      Id. at 16-18. The Court looked at the epidemiological studies underlying the Bostics’ experts’ testimony and concluded that none\nof them supported an association between the disease and the kind of occasional exposure to asbestos to which Bostic testified with\nrespect to Georgia-Pacific’s products. To the contrary, they examined consistent, occupational exposure. See id.\n\nOne Justice concurred in the Bostic judgment, agreeing that Bostic’s causation evidence was legally insufficient but disagreeing with the\nlegal standard adopted by the majority. Id. at 19-20. The concurring Justice noted that the Bostics ″offered epidemiological studies of\noccupational exposure that were extrapolated to purportedly measure risk from occasional exposure,″ such as Timothy Bostic’s exposure\nto Georgia-Pacific’s products, but they ″never substantiated those extrapolations, yielding an analytical gap in [their] proof of causation.″\nId. at 20.\n703\n      Id. at 25-37 (Lehrman, J., joined by Boyd, J. and Devine, J., dissenting).\n704\n      Id. at 28. The majority disagreed, stating the ″substantial factor″ is not a separate causation requirement but, instead, ″describes\nthe level of proof required to establish specific causation, which is always an element of the plaintiff’s case.″ Id. at 12.\n705\n      Id. at 28 (Lehrman, J., joined by Boyd, J. and Devine, J., dissenting). The majority agreed that if a plaintiff could establish that\nhis exposure to a particular toxin is the only possible cause of his disease and that the defendant’s product is the only possible source\nof his exposure, ″this proof might amount to direct proof of causation″ such that the alternative means of proving causation through\nepidemiological studies might be unnecessary. Id. at 13. But it did not agree that the Bostics had presented any direct proof that\nGeorgia-Pacific’s product caused Timothy Bostic’s mesothelioma or that the testimony estimating the period of time over which Timothy\nwas exposed to Georgia-Pacific’s product on some number of occasions amounted to evidence of how much exposure occurred during\nthat period of time.

Georgia-Pacific did not dispute that asbestos causes mesothelioma, nor did it truely\nchallenge the contention that Bostic’s exposure to asbestos had caused his mesothelioma. 709 The\nprincipal dispute in the case was whether Georgia-Pacific’s asbestos-containing products caused\nBostic’s mesothelioma, as opposed to the products of other manufacturers (some of whom had settled\nwith the Bostics), to which Bostic may have had greater exposure. 710 The Court might have reached\nthe same result in the case without extending the Havner requirements to defendant-specific exposure\nlevels (as opposed to aggregate exposure levels) by relying on the considerations espoused in Flores:\nthe Lohrmann ″frequency, regularity, and proximity″ test plus the Restatement (Second) of Torts’\nsubstantial factor requirement. 711 As the dissent noted, by applying Havner to defendant-specific\nexposure levels, Bostic prevents a plaintiff from recovering from any defendant if he was exposed to\nasbestos from multiple products in small amounts, none of which alone more the doubled his risk of\nmesothelioma, but which collectively caused the mesothelioma. 712 An alternative approach would be\nto consider how ″substantial″ the plaintiff’s exposure to an individual defendant’s products is relative\nto his total exposure, which could include exposure to the products of manufacturers with which the\nplaintiff already settled.\n\nFinally, although most of the jurisprudence on epidemiological evidence focuses on the probativeness\nof the studies (i.e., whether they actually tend to prove a causal relationship), courts have also rejected\nepidemiological evidence based on the soundness of the studies (i.e., when they do not bear [*129]\nthe necessary indicia of reliability under Daubert/Havner) regardless of whether the study’s results\nsupport the expert’s conclusion. 713 In Wells v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., the Fifth Circuit applied\nthe Daubert factors to an observational epidemiological study on which the claimant’s expert relied,\nthe ″Weintraub Poster study,″ and found that the study did not pass muster. 714 The claimant in the case\n\n709\n      Id. at 1.\n710\n      Id. at 14-16.\n711\n      Borg-Warner Corp. v.

Essentially, the majority opinion in Bostic effectuates the Restatement (Third)’s ″multiple\nsufficient causes″ exception to the but-for-causation requirement, at least for multi-defendant, asbestos-disease cases. See infra note 794.\nBut this does not account for a scenario in which a disease is caused by exposure to multiple defendants’ products, none of which alone\ndoubled the plaintiff’s relative risk but all of which combined to cause the plaintiff’s disease. A plaintiff who could conclusively prove\nthat his mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos in 200 defendants’ products might nevertheless be unable to recover against\nany defendant (at least in reliance on epidemiological evidence) because his aggregate exposure was significant but his exposure to each\nindividual defendant’s products was minimal. The Restatement (Third) addresses this scenario, to some degree, with its burden-shifting\nrule. See Restatement (Third) of Torts , supra note 570, at §§27, 28.\n713\n       See, e.g., Wells v.

After noting that epidemiological studies\nrelied on by a testifying expert must be soundly designed and executed, the Havner Court went on to review not the reliability of the\nstudy’s protocols but whether the results of the study had any meaningful bearing on causation, even assuming they were reliably\nproduced. See Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518823\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518823/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-havner/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719-20 (Tex. 1997). Here, courts are not examining the\nmethodology employed by the expert himself, but rather, the methodology employed by the scientists who conducted the epidemiological\nstudy. The Court has said that a testifying expert cannot rely on scientific studies if the scientists who conducted them did not employ\nreasonably sound practices or demonstrated unreasonable bias. See id. at 719.\n714\n      Wells, 601 F.3d at 380. The Weintraub Poster study was a case-controlled observational study. See id. Echoing its statement in\nKnight v.

Resolution of the conflict is an issue for the jury as\nlong as there is reliable evidence on both sides of the issue, even if the evidence on one side is stronger\nthan the evidence on the other side. 723\nomitted) (quoting Knight v.

Epidemiological studies are often considered the first tier for indirect proof\nof causation in the toxic tort context. 724 When epidemiological studies are unavailable or inconclusive,\nexperts may turn to animal studies. Under the first component of predicative reliability, animal studies\nare subject to the same standards of internal integrity and validity applicable to epidemiological studies\nand all expert evidence generally - they must be properly designed and executed such that they could\nbe reasonably relied upon by experts in the relevant field of expertise. 725 The second component of\npredicative reliability - whether the animal studies actually provide reliable support for the expert’s\ncausation conclusion - is typically less about significance and meaning of the studies in and of\nthemselves and more about the significance of the studies in relation to humans and the facts of the\ncase. 726 For this reason, animal studies are primarily decided under the rubric of the connective\nreliability gate. 727 The question is whether the expert can adequately connect the results of the animal\nstudies to the circumstances of the case, including bridging the anatomical differences between humans\nand the kinds of animals used in the studies.\n\n[*132] One court of appeals has relied on Havner to state broadly that ″animal studies, standing alone,\nare generally held to be inadequate to prove causation in humans absent other confirming\nPrempro, but the women reported their duration of use only at the time they enrolled in the study. Id. at 629. The study showed ″elevated″\nrelative risk of breast cancer among women who reported using the drug for less than a year at the time of enrollment and that ″the breast\ncancers were diagnosed on average 1.2 years after recruitment.″ Id. The claimants’ expert testified that by adding the average 1.2 years\nfrom enrollment to diagnosis, the study could be said to show an elevated risk in less than 2.2 years of use. Id. at 629-30. The third study\ninvolved more than 50,000 French women. Id. at 630. The expert recognized that this approach would result in some ″misclassifications″\nbut that because of the ″very large numbers″ in the study, ″small amounts of misclassifications don’t really make a lot of difference.″\nId.\n\nThe court recognized that most French women use a different formulation than Prempro and that the study did not distinguish between\ndifferent formulations of hormone therapy. Id. The study showed an increased risk of breast cancer among women taking hormone\ntherapy for less than two years when the women began taking the hormone therapy shortly after the onset of menopause. Id. The\nclaimants’ expert noted that the WHI study’s participants were more than ten years past the onset of menopause. Id. at 623. Wyeth argued\nthat the WHI study was a randomized control study, ″the ″gold standard’ of epidemiological studies,″ that disproved the contention that\nshort term use of Prempro could cause breast cancer and that the claimants’ causation expert, who had relied on the WHI study in\nprevious cases, had failed to adequately refute the study’s findings. Id. at 622-23. Wyeth argued that the claimants’ expert had ″cherry\npicked″ the three observational studies on which he relied from ″a wealth of studies″ showing no increased risk of breast cancer from\nshort term use. Id. at 633. The MDL magistrate judge agreed and excluded the expert’s testimony. Id. at 626. The Eight Circuit disagreed.\nId. at 627. The court stated that the claimants did not bear the burden of disproving the WHI study’s finding that short term use of\nPrempro does not increase the risk of breast cancer; as long as their expert ″arrived at his contrary opinion in a scientifically sound and\nmethodological fashion,″ the issue was one of conflicting evidence for the jury to resolve.

It can be read to hold only that,\nwhen an expert relies on epidemiological evidence as a predicate for a causation opinion in a toxic tort\ncase, the epidemiological evidence does not provide adequate support for the expert’s opinion unless\nit includes at least two studies demonstrating at least a ″doubling of the risk″; or it can be read to hold\nwhen an expert offers a causation opinion in a toxic tort case, the predicate for the opinion must include\nat least two epidemiological studies demonstrating at least a ″doubling of the risk″ - no other predicate\nwill suffice. The second construction of Havner would preclude an expert from ever reaching a\ncausation opinion in a toxic tort case based on animal studies alone. This construction was advanced\nin a case recently decided by the Texas Supreme Court. 729 The Court’s opinion in Bostic establishes\nthat epidemiological evidence is not an absolute requirement for proof of causation in a toxic tort: the\nplaintiff may choose instead to provide ″direct, scientifically reliable proof of causation.″ 730 Havner\n″offers an alternative method of establishing causation″ when such direct proof is not available. 731\n\nWhile Bostic answers the question of whether Havner-satisfying epidemiological evidence is an\nabsolute requirement for causation in toxic tort cases, it does not answer the question of whether\nanimal studies could ever be sufficient in the absence of such epidemiological studies. Bostic\nrecognized an exception for ″direct″ causation evidence, but animal studies, like epidemiological\nstudies, are ″indirect″ causation evidence. Whatever the outcome in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court’s\nrejection of the expert’s reliance on animal studies in Joiner is probably not so broad. The Joiner Court\nexpressly noted that ″whether animal studies can ever be a proper foundation for an expert’s opinion″\nwas not the issue in the case. 732 Instead, the [*133] Court focused on the analytical gap between the\ncircumstances of the animal studies and the circumstances of the case (animal v. human, high\nconcentration v. low concentration), and the expert’s failure to bridge that gap (i.e., connective\nreliability). 733\n\niv.

Material Safety Data Sheets and Safety Standards. Experts sometimes rely on federal regulations\n(particularly from the EPA, FDA, or OSHA), warnings provided by governmental or private entities,\nand material safety data sheets (MSDS) to infer a causal relationship between a particular substance\nand a particular illness or injury. Some courts have, for example, concluded that information from a\nchemical’s MSDS can, in some cases, provide an adequate predicate for identifying a chemical as a\npotential cause, particularly when combined with other support. 750 But like federal regulations and\nhealth warnings, an MSDS is not designed to establish causation. Courts have generally allowed\nMSDSs and other types of formalized health warnings to serve as a predicate for expert opinions on\ncausation only when the MSDS provide sufficient factual information to support the expert’s analysis.\n751\n\n\n\nDavid Bernstein has observed that the considerations that govern a governmental agency’s adoption of\na safety standard differ in material ways from the considerations that govern the law’s imposition of\nliability. 752\n\nWhere government agencies are charged with proactively protecting the public health from potential\ntoxic threats, agencies often have no choice but to rely on scientists’ best guesses in the face of\n743\n      McClain v.

But such best guesses are not admissible in toxic tort cases, where the law\ndemands reliable expert testimony regarding causation. 753\n\n[*136] A Texas court of appeals echoed these sentiments in Makofski, rejecting the use of the EPA’s\n″lower standards″ because ″differences in costs and benefits make false positives acceptable in some\nsituations but unacceptable in others.″ 754 The court observed that ″it may be appropriate for the EPA\nto protect people from chemical exposure on weak evidence that it will cause any harm, but that does\nnot make it equally appropriate to impose a judgment of several million dollars on weak evidence that\na defendant caused any harm.″ 755 In Moore v. Ashland Chemical, Inc., the Fifth Circuit affirmed the\nexclusion of differential diagnosis testimony when the physician ruled in a particular chemical as a\npotential cause of the claimant’s RADS based on a statement in the chemical’s MSDS that\noverexposure to the chemical could cause injury to the lungs depending on the concentration and\nduration of exposure. 756 Because the risk identified in the MSDS depended on the concentration and\nduration of exposure but the MSDS did not identify the degree of concentration or level of exposure\nnecessary to give rise to the risk, the expert could not rule in the chemical as a potential cause of RADS\nbased on the MSDS alone. 757 A Texas court of appeals relied on Moore to reach the same conclusion\nin Brookshire Bros., Inc. v. Smith, when an expert opined that a commercial cleaner caused the\nplaintiff’s RADS based in part on the cleaner’s MSDS and warning labels. 758 The court stated that\n″neither the MSDS nor the warning labels, standing alone, provide the type of specific, detailed\nshowing of scientific reliability required to accord evidentiary value to an expert’s opinion.″ 759 The\ncourt further noted that ″there was no evidence produced at trial that discussed the scientific foundation\nused in formulating the conclusions contained in either the MSDS or the warning labels.″ 760\n\n\n\n\n753\n      Id.

Anderson, a Texas appellate court held, en banc, that the trial court\nhad abused its discretion in allowing the plaintiff’s medical expert to testify that exposure to the\nchemical naphtha caused the plaintiff’s pneumonia based on the plaintiff’s medical records, the MSDS\nfor naphtha, and lay testimony that the plaintiff was healthy before inhaling the naphtha fumes but\nbecame ill soon afterward. 763 The court observed that ″no expert established that [the treating\nphysician’s] diagnostic records, the naphtha MSDS, or any other nonexpert evidence on which [the\ntestifying expert] now relies met the appropriate Daubert/Robinson/Jordan inquiry as to general\ncausation,″ and this was ″fatal to [the expert’s] claims.″ 764\n\nBut ten years after Coastal Tankships, a panel from the same court allowed a chemist to rely on\ninformation in a chemical’s MSDS in reaching his conclusion that the chemical caused a fire in Control\nSolutions, Inc. v. Gharda USA, Inc. 765 In Control Solutions, the expert was a forensic chemist and\nchemical fire expert who did not rely exclusively or even primarily on the MSDS to support a causation\nconclusion; instead, he relied on the MSDS as supplying data about the chemical (particularly the\ntemperature at which it would thermally decompose) that he used as a basis for further research. 766\n\n [*138] Similarly, in Best v. Lowes Home Centers, Inc., the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that\na physician could properly rule in EZ Aqua as a potential cause of the claimant’s anosmia based in part\non the EZ Aqua’s MSDS statement that it is ″irritating to the mucous membrane and upper respiratory\ntract″ and ″may be harmful if inhaled,″ but also based on the physician’s experience and knowledge\nof anosmia and its causal relationship to chlorine derivatives like that contained in EZ Aqua. 767 The\nBest court relied on a Second Circuit Court of Appeals case, McCullock v.

Gislaved Gummi AB, the court allowed a\nphysician to rely on a statement in the MSDS for talc that inhalation of talc dust ″in high concentrations\nirritates mucous membranes″ to ″rule in″ talc as a potential cause of the claimant’s sinus condition\nwhen there was evidence that the claimant was exposed to ″very high levels of airborne talc throughout\nhis workday.″ 770\nIn sum, an expert generally may rely on an MSDS to provide factual information about a particular\nchemical. The expert may then apply her own methodology and analysis to reach a conclusion on\ncausation based, in whole or in part, on those facts. But an MSDS is not designed for the purpose of\nestablishing causation. When an expert attempts to rely on an MSDS not for discrete data but to supply\na conclusion on causation, the MSDS must stand up to the same standards applicable to any expert\nopinion on causation; i.e., the proffering party must demonstrate the predicative, methodological, and\nconnective reliability of the analysis that led to the conclusion in the MSDS regarding causation.\nIn some cases, experts have attempted to rely on federal health and safety regulations and standards\nas a predicate for ruling in potential causes of a claimant’s injury or illness in differential diagnosis\ntestimony. Courts have admitted expert testimony predicated on federal regulations or safety standards\n [*139] set by federal health-or safety-related agencies as part of a larger body of scientific literature\ndemonstrating that ″it is generally accepted in the medical community″ that exposure to a particular\nsubstance can cause a particular illness. 771 But like an MSDS, health and safety regulations and\nstandards are not designed for the purpose of establishing a causal connection between a substance and\na disease. They thus generally are not, alone, a sufficient predicate for an expert’s opinion on general\ncausation. In Pluck v. BP Oil Pipeline Co., the testifying physician ″ruled in″ the claimant’s exposure\nto benzene as a potential cause of her Parkinson’s disease based on an EPA safety regulation stating\nthat the maximum permissible contaminant level for benzene in drinking water is five ppb. 772 But the\nphysician was unable to determine the claimant’s level of exposure and did not have a basis for\nconcluding that she was ever exposed to benzene at a level equal to or in excess of five ppb. 773 The\ncourt held that evidence that benzene was unsafe in certain dosages did not provide a reliable basis for\n″ruling in″ benzene as a potential cause of the claimant’s injury when there was no basis for concluding\nthat the claimant was exposed to the unsafe dosage. 774\nThe fatal defect in both Moore and Pluck was the absence of necessary ″dosage″ data - either the data\nnecessary to determine at what dosage a substance poses a particular danger or data necessary to\n769\n      McCullock, 61 F.3d. at 1041, 1044.\n770\n      Westberry v.

But precise\nexposure data is not always essential to differential diagnosis testimony. 777 In Westberry, for example,\nevidence of ″very high levels″ of exposure to airborne talc, including testimony that talc settling from\nthe air around the claimant’s workspace onto the floor was ″so thick one could see footprints in it,″ was\nsufficient when supplied with evidence that ″high concentrations″ could cause the kind of injury\nsuffered by the claimant. 778\nBut even if exposure data is included in a federal safety standard, the standard will not supply an\nadequate predicate for ″ruling in″ a potential cause if it is not adequately tied to the applicable legal\nstandards for causation. In Glastetter v.

Experts are permitted to predicate their\nopinions on the opinions and findings offered by other experts in the case. 784 The danger in this\napproach is that if the underlying expert’s opinion is excluded or deemed to constitute no evidence, the\ndependent expert opinion will likely also be excluded or deemed no evidence, unless the expert has\nprovided other, independently sufficient support for his opinion. 785 Additionally, an expert may not\nmerely ″parrot″ the opinion of another expert; each expert must be giving his own opinion. 786\n\n [*142]\n\nb.

For example, in Total Clean, LLC v. Cox Smith\nMatthews Inc., a court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment\non a plaintiff’s claim for lost profits when the plaintiff’s damages expert, at the plaintiff’s request,\nbased his calculation on the incorrect assumption that the plaintiff-company, a truck washing operation,\nhad been operating successfully for eighteen months. 814 The expert relied on this assumption to\ndecrease the applicable discount rate from 30% to 20%, which in turn drastically increased the\nplaintiff’s projected lost profits. 815 But the expert conceded that the assumption was untrue and that\nhe had relied on the assumption, as well as performance numbers provided by the plaintiff rather than\nthose derived from comparable businesses, in making his calculations at the plaintiff’s request. 816\nInstead of treating the testimony as evidence of some lesser amount of damages, the court concluded\nthat the expert’s opinion was ″unreliable and had no probative value.″ 817\nSimilarly, another Texas court of appeals reversed a lost profits award and rendered a take-nothing\njudgment when the only evidence of lost profits was expert testimony predicated on unfounded\nassumptions. 818 The defendant did not dispute the validity of the expert’s methodology, but argued\nthat the expert’s ″assumptions were based on mere speculation and surmise rather than on the facts of\n\n\nassumption about manner in which physician placed lenses because expert ″consistently maintained that, regardless of whether they were\nplaced vertically or where Dr. Marvelli testified he rotated them, the haptics should have been placed horizontally at 3:00 and 9:00\no’clock″).\n810\n      Hous.

Jackson 822 for the proposition that\n″recovery of lost profits is allowed where a business is established on the strength of a contract but is\ndiscontinued because of its breach.″ 823 The court of appeals held that the plaintiff could not rely on\nthat principle because its business was not established on the basis of the contract on which the expert\nrelied; to the contrary, the business had been in operation (operating at a loss) for years. 824 As in Total\nClean, the Capital Metro court criticized the expert for basing his calculations on a number of\nperformance assumptions, at the plaintiff’s instruction, without independently investigating and\nconfirming the numbers. 825\n\nMeasuring lost profits, however, is an ″inherently speculative undertaking.″ 826 In making such\nmeasurements, an expert may rely on assumptions that are reasonable and consistent with the facts of\nthe case. In Toshiba Machine Co. v. SPM Flow Control, Inc., for example, an appellate court concluded\nthat an expert’s lost profits opinion was reliable even though the expert did not determine all of the\ndetails of potential sales. 827 For example, one component of the expert’s lost profits calculation was\nbased on profits lost from (due to the other party’s fault) quoting prices that were too high or delivery\ntimes that were too long to suit the company’s customers, but the expert admitted he did not determine\nwhat price or delivery time would have induced the party’s customers to buy from it. 828 The expert\nhad personally contacted customers to determine the cause of their cancellations and calculated the\nresulting lost profits based on the company’s existing margin data. 829 The other components of the\nexpert’s lost profits opinion were likewise based on the company’s existing production rates, shop rates\n(which the expert had determined to be industry standard and independently examined to ensure\naccuracy), sales history, and [*149] profit margin. 830 The court noted that the company had been\nprofitable for years and stated that the expert’s calculations were reliably based on ″proven products″\nand ″existing customers.″ 831\n819\n      Id. at 580.\n820\n      Id. at 581-82.\n821\n      Id. at 579-80.\n822\n      Pace Corp. v.

L. Rev. 1, *149\n\nRule 703 permits experts to draw inferences from the factual record in the case, 832 but the Texas\nSupreme Court has constrained expert inferences in much the same way it has constrained expert\nopinions generally: an expert cannot merely draw possible inferences from the facts and state a\nconclusion; instead, the expert must provide the jury with the basis for his inferences. 833 Thus, in\nJelinek v. Casas, the Court said,\n\nWhen the only evidence of a vital fact is circumstantial, the expert cannot merely draw possible\ninferences from the evidence and state that ″in medical probability″ the injury was caused by the\ndefendant’s negligence. The expert must explain why the inferences drawn are medically preferable to\ncompeting inferences that are equally consistent with the known facts. Thus, when the facts support\nseveral possible conclusions, only some of which establish that the defendant’s negligence caused the\nplaintiff’s injury, the expert must explain to the fact finder why those conclusions are superior based\non verifiable medical evidence, not simply the expert’s opinion. 834\n\nWhen facts give rise to equal inferences - i.e., when they are consistent with the opinion formed by\nthe expert but also equally consistent with an opposing conclusion - they will not provide an adequate\nbasis for the expert’s opinion. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Merrell, 835 discussed above, 836 a key fault\nin the plaintiffs’ expert’s theory about what caused a home fire was that the factual evidence on which\nthe expert relied to support his theory was equally consistent with the defendant’s expert’s alternative\ntheory about what caused the fire. 837\n\nFinally, while experts may draw inferences from the facts of the case, 838 the general rule that ″an\ninference may not be based upon another inference″ 839 applies to expert evidence - experts [*150]\nmay not ″pile inference upon inference.″ 840 Nor may courts supply inferences on an expert’s behalf\nin order to fill material gaps in the expert’s testimony. 841\n832\n      Tex.

The Court emphasized this point in Whirlpool:\n\nWitnesses offered as experts in an area or subject will invariably have experience in that field. If courts\nmerely accept ″experience″ as a substitute for proof that an expert’s opinions are reliable and then only\nexamine the testimony for analytical gaps in the expert’s logic and opinions, an expert can effectively\ninsulate his or her conclusions from meaningful review by filling gaps in the testimony with almost any\ntype of data or subjective opinions. 853\n\nThus, ″while an expert’s overwhelming qualifications may bear on the reliability of his proffered\ntestimony, they are by no means a guarantor of reliability.″ 854 A very qualified expert may ″still offer\nunreliable testimony.″ 855 Strong qualifications do not save an otherwise unreliable opinion. 856\n849\n      Dart v.

This requirement\ntypically is not satisfied by a ″random experience″ or an ″isolated case.″ 875 And courts frequently\ndemand disclosure of the specifics of an expert’s predicative experiences; vague recollections may be\ndeemed insufficient to support the expert’s opinion. 876\nBut extensive ″experience can suffice to validate a proposition even when the experience cannot be\nprecisely [*156] quantified.″ 877 Courts could look to a number of facts to determine the sufficiency\nof the quantity of experience. The publication Daubert factor may have some potential applicability for\ndetermining the sufficiency of an expert’s experience. An expert who has published his experience has\ngiven some objective criteria outside the litigation context of the experience and has subjected that\nexperience to comparison by other experts. However, experts may have vast experience without\npublishing an article describing their experience.\nTo evaluate the sufficiency of the experience, courts should require an expert to identify examples of\nher experience because the reliability inquiry does not blindly accept an expert’s claim of predicate\ndata without inquiry. 878 Thus, an expert’s declaration that a term has an industry meaning or that a\npractice is standard is insufficient; the expert needs to present some support for the declaration. 879 ″If\nthe witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, then the witness must explain how that\nexperience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion,\nand how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.″ 880 ″It is not enough for the expert to explain\nthat he or she is resting the opinion on his or her education or experience.″ 881 ″The trial court’s\n\n873\n      Cf. id.\n874\n      Cf. id.\n875\n      Minn.

These clues are plausible and widely accepted by fire department arson\ninvestigators. The difficulty, though, is that there have been few ″full-scale burns″ of buildings to\nverify that such factors accurately identify the starting place of a fire. To make matters worse, ″nothing\nin the natural world ″tests’ an arson investigator’s expertise. If an arson investigator is wrong, nothing\nruns aground or burns down.″ These clues are in widespread use, but there is little objective evidence\nthat their use yields accurate results. Without any effort to detect error and evaluate the results of the\nuse of the technique, the analysts might simply be repeating the same mistakes over and over again.\n884\n\n\n\n″While the relevant factors for determining reliability will vary from expertise to expertise,″ the\nAdvisory Committee’s notes state that Rule 702\n\nrejects the premise that an expert’s testimony should be treated more permissively simply because it\nis outside the realm of science. An opinion from an expert who is not a scientist should receive the\nsame degree of scrutiny for reliability as an opinion from an expert who purports to be a scientist. 885\n\nProfessor Imwinkelried gives a helpful illustration demonstrating the need to establish an adequate\namount of experience for experience-based expert testimony:\n\nSuppose, for instance, that in a contract lawsuit, there is a dispute over the meaning of a term in the\nwritten agreement. To support her interpretation of the term, the plaintiff calls an experienced member\nof the industry as an expert witness. The witness proposes to testify that within the industry, there is\na trade custom or usage as to the meaning of that term. The expert’s specific theory is that [*158] the\nusage exists within the industry. So long as the witness testifies that he or she has been a member of\nthe industry for a certain period of time and has encountered that usage of the term on several occasions\nby industry members, the foundation ought to be deemed adequate.

The expert evaluates the experience and draws a further inference as to fact B.″\n889\n    An example would be when a physician describes her experience performing a particular procedure\nand then draws an inference regarding the standard of care for a reasonably prudent physician. The\nphysician’s experience alone is insufficient to make a logical inferential determination that her practice\nis the same as the standard of care, that requires evidence of what other physicians do or do not do\nunder the same or similar circumstances. When experience is used as the basis for a medical causation\nopinion, the expert is also making an inferential determination based on that experience. In that\nsituation, ″one or a few isolated anecdotes should not suffice.″ 890 Instead, courts should first ″insist[]\nupon a showing of ″many instances’ - a definite pattern of consistent outcomes - before they [are]\nwilling to infer a relationship or connection.″ 891 Additionally, courts ″should demand proof of the\nresults″ of the expert’s experience. 892\n\nIn each of these situations, experience is not operating as a factor supporting the reliability of an\nexpert’s methodology. Rather, the expert’s experience is operating as a basis for the opinion, by\nproviding data gathered through the expert’s personal experience, by using the expert’s experience as\na methodology for analyzing the data in the case, or both. And as discussed below, experience can also\nfunction as the connection [*159] or link between an expert’s methodology or predicate data to the\nexpert’s conclusion when an expert must extrapolate from either of those two bases to reach her\nconclusion. 893 At least one legal authority has observed that what we refer to in this Article as\n″connective reliability″ plays a particularly important role in assessing experience-based opinions. 894\n\nii.

Krist, the Elizondos sued their former attorneys,\nalleging that the attorneys had settled their personal injury claims against BP Amoco Chemical\nCompany for less than the claims were worth. 907 The Elizondos’ underlying claims against BP arose\nout of an explosion at BP’s Texas City refinery that gave rise to approximately 4,000 claims against\nBP, all of which BP settled. 908 The Elizondos attempted to demonstrate damages for their malpractice\nclaim through the affidavit of an attorney-expert who had represented a number of other claimants\nagainst BP in these settlements. 909 The expert identified ten factors that BP had considered in\ndetermining the settlement value of claims like the Elizondos’ and concluded that the Elizondos’\nformer attorneys had breached the standard of care by settling the Elizondos’ claims against BP for $\n50,000, which he described as ″basically … nuisance value,″ because he placed the actual settlement\nvalue of the claims between two and three million dollars. 910 The expert predicated his opinion on the\nfacts of the case, his ″experience in the BP litigation,″ his ″knowledge of general settlement values,″\nand ″the criteria and protocol relied upon to establish general settlement values in the BP litigation.″\n911\n    Essentially, the expert used BP’s ten settlement-evaluation criteria to compare the Elizondos’\nclaims to other claims BP settled after the refinery explosion and determined that the Elizondos’ claims\nwere settled for much less than other comparable claims. 912 The Court held that the expert testimony\nwas conclusory under a connective reliability analysis, 913 but the Court specifically approved of the\nattorney’s use of other settlements as factual predicates for his opinion on the value of the Elizondos’\nunderlying claims:\nUnder Evidence Rule 703, experts may base their testimony on facts or data that are ″of a type\nreasonably relied upon [*162] by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon\nthe subject.″ That test is met when, in a mass tort litigation involving thousands of similar claimants\nand arising out of the same event, the expert measures the ″true″ settlement value of a particular case\n905\n       Id. at 762-63 (″While Texas courts have not routinely required billing records or other documentary evidence to substantiate a claim\nfor attorney’s fees, the requirement has merit in contested cases under the lodestar approach… . [The] proof should include the basic\nfacts underlying the lodestar, which are: (1) the nature of the work, (2) who performed the services and their rate, (3) approximately when\nthe services were performed, and (4) the number of hours worked. An attorney could, of course, testify to these details, but in all but\nthe simplest cases, the attorney would probably have to refer to some type of record or documentation to provide this information. Thus,\nwhen there is an expectation that the lodestar method will be used to calculate fees, attorneys should document their time much as they\nwould for their own clients, that is, contemporaneous billing records or other documentation recorded reasonably close to the time when\nthe work is performed.″).\n906\n      Elizondo v.

But sometimes both experience and\npredicative data are available, and in those cases, a court may wish to consider both. For example, an\nattorney may testify that a billing rate is ″standard″ or ″reasonable″ in a community for an attorney\nwith a certain level of experience. 916 The attorney’s testimony is not reliable ″if the attorney only\nknows the hourly rate charged by the attorneys handling the dispute and by the expert’s colleagues in\nhis or her own law firm.″ 917 But he may know the fees charged by other attorneys. And the\nexpert-attorney may have data available on attorney’s billing rates from the Texas Lawyer. There may\nalso be a question of connective reliability - the expert may not have any experience with the particular\ntype of case and may have to extrapolate from other cases or may have billing rate data from one area\nof the state but not from the county of the lawsuit. Finally, although the conclusory nature of an\nattorney’s opinion on the reasonableness of attorney’s fees should, in theory, depend solely on the\nproffered opinion and support for it, whether the sufficiency of the evidence on fees was contested at\ntrial and the degree to which the opinion testimony was challenged by the opposing party seem to play\na [*163] meaningful role in the degree of scrutiny applied by appellate courts.\n\nFinally, whether offered by an attorney or another type of expert, an opinion based on an erroneous\ninterpretation of a contract 918 or the law 919 is not reliable. 920\n\niii.

We discuss legal expert testimony in detail below. See infra notes 1458-67 and accompanying text.\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 125 of 230\n                                                       52 Hous.

The principles of mathematics and physics\non which such experts base their opinions (methodological reliability) are sometimes well established\nand unquestioned; 921 in those cases, challenges to the expert testimony are frequently based on the\ndata the expert plugged into the equation (predicative reliability), the assumptions on which the\nequation was based (predicative reliability), or the ″fit″ between the factual predicate of the expert’s\nopinion and the actual facts of the case (connective reliability). 922 Although the first and third focuses\noverlap, our focus in this section is on opinion testimony lacking a factual predicate - i.e., when the\ndata the expert plugged into the calculations or the assumptions on which the calculations were based\nare unsupported by, or inconsistent with, the evidence in the case.\nIn Whirlpool, for example, the plaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony of an electrical engineer\nto prove a design defect. 923 [*164] The engineer testified that the fire in the plaintiffs’ home started\nwhen lint particles in their Whirlpool-manufactured clothes dryer ignited the clothes in the dryer. 924\nThe expert presented a detailed process by which the fire could have started in the dryer: the dryer’s\ncorrugated tube allowed lint to hang up on the inside of the tube and clog it; the clogged tube caused\nlint to back up into the blower housing assembly, from which excessive amounts of it escaped by being\nblown through a gasket-like seal between the lint chute and the blower housing (the ″lint chute seal″),\nand into the dryer cabinet; the lint was then forced through the lint chute seal, became airborne, and\nwas drawn into the heater box; some airborne lint particles then passed through the heater box, were\nignited as they passed by the heater element, and traveled vertically to the inlet grill; there, the lint\nparticles either entered the drum or came into contact with and ignited other lint that had become\nattached to the inlet grill, and then the newly-ignited lint entered the rotating drum; once the ignited\nlint was in the dryer drum, it landed in the drying, tumbling clothes, and smoldered there through the\nremainder of the drying and cool-down cycles and the period of time after the dryer shut off; when one\nof the plaintiffs opened the dryer door, oxygen entered the drum and the increased oxygen level\nallowed the smoldering lint and clothes to burst into flames. 925\nBut the Texas Supreme Court held that the expert’s testimony was ″conclusory″ and ″not entitled to\nprobative weight″ because of the inadequacy of the predicate on which his opinion rested. 926 First,\nwhile a clogged lint tube might cause the kind of back up the engineer described, there was no basis\nfor concluding that the plaintiff’s lint tube was clogged. 927 The tube had been destroyed in the fire,\nso the engineer examined the transport tube from an ″exemplar″ dryer. 928 But the ″exemplar″ dryer\n\n\n921\n      Other times, however, engineering experts’ methodologies are challenged. For example, when the expert failed to conduct any\nphysical testing or support theoretical calculations and models. See infra note 1247 and accompanying text (stating that courts often rely\non the absence of testing in concluding that an expert’s testimony is unreliable).\n922\n      See supra Part III.B.2 (discussing the relevancy and importance of factual predicates of an expert’s opinion and cases where an\nexpert’s opinion relies on false facts or assumptions).\n923\n      Whirlpool Corp. v.

Accident Reconstruction Technical Predicates. Accident reconstructionists also often rely on\nphysics and mathematical predicates, as well as their experience, for their opinions about how an\naccident came to pass. The Texas Supreme Court provided a useful comparison of expert testimony in\nproduct liability cases in TXI Transportation, discussing two of the Court’s prior cases involving\naccident reconstruction expert testimony as exemplars of when such testimony is reliable and when it\nis not. 937 In both cases, the principal issue was whether [*166] the failure of a defective mechanical\npart was the cause of the accident or was caused by the accident, but the Court found the expert\ntestimony reliable in one case (Ledesma) and unreliable in the other (Ramirez). 938\nIn Ledesma, the expert, a metallurgical and mechanical engineer, opined that a u-bolt on the plaintiff’s\ntruck became under-torqued on the rear leaf spring and axle assembly causing the axle assembly to\n929\n      Id.\n930\n       Id. Notably, the ″analytical gap″ between the circumstances of the exemplar dryer and the circumstances of the plaintiff’s dryer\nleft the expert with no predicate for his opinion that the dryer’s transport tube became clogged. See id. at 639-40.\n931\n      Id.\n932\n      Id. at 640-41.\n933\n      Id. at 641.\n934\n      Id.\n935\n       Id. Here again, the plaintiffs’ expert lacked any predicate for his assumption (that lint ignited clothing in the dryer) because the\nonly predicate that the expert had (the lint-ignition tests) lacked connective reliability - i.e., the expert failed to explain why the ″gap″\nbetween dryers with inlet grill and dryers without an inlet grill was not material to his theory of the fire. See id. The Court agreed with\nthe plaintiffs that ″testing is not always required to support an expert’s opinion,″ but the Court qualified that standard by stating that when\ntesting is possible, the lack of such testing ″is one factor that points toward a determination that an expert opinion is unreliable.″ Id. at\n642. The Court also criticized the expert’s opinion on methodological reliability grounds and connective reliability grounds.

In Lincoln v. Clark Freight Lines, Inc., the court of appeals\nrejected a challenge to accident reconstruction testimony from an experienced deputy on the ground\nthat the deputy had determined the hardness of the vehicle’s tire rubber (for purposes of determining\nthe coefficient of friction) by ″eyeballing the tires″ rather than using a Durometer. 944 The court\ndetermined that the expert could rely on his ″years of experience testing the coefficient of friction with\n″similar tires’ … [which] supplied scientific proof that the [test car’s] drag coefficient would be similar\nto that of the [plaintiff’s car].″ 945 The court concluded that the trial court did not err in finding that\nthe expert’s testimony was not based on merely subjective belief or unsupported speculation. 946\n\nv.

For example, in Manpower, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, the Seventh Circuit\noverturned a district court’s exclusion of an expert’s opinion of the plaintiff’s business interruption\nlosses, calculated using a growth rate extrapolation methodology. 949 The expert’s methodology was\nsound and was not the subject of the [*168] district court’s concern. 950 Instead, the issue was whether\nthe data points used by the expert in his calculations were sufficiently reliable. 951 The Seventh Circuit\nsaid that ″the reliability of data and assumptions used in applying a methodology is tested by the\nadversarial process and determined by the jury; the court’s role is generally limited to assessing the\nreliability of the methodology - the framework - of the expert’s analysis.″ 952 The court clarified that\nan expert may not rely on data ″that has no quantitative or qualitative connection to the methodology\nemployed,″ 953 but rather, must rely on the ″kinds of facts or data on which experts in the field would\nreasonably rely.″ 954\nBecause Texas courts are not limited to pre-admission review of reliability and may also test reliability\nposttrial through a legal-sufficiency challenge, the data underlying an expert’s damages opinion is\nsubject to scrutiny in light of the facts developed at trial. 955 Consistent with the Seventh Circuit’s\ncaution that foundational data for an expert opinion cannot be quantitatively or qualitatively\ndisconnected from the facts of the case, Texas courts have rejected damages opinions based on an\nacceptable methodology when the predicative data used in the calculations lacks sufficient similarity\nor comparability to the facts of the case. 956 For example, in Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority v.\nKraft, the Texas Supreme Court held that a trial court erred in admitting the testimony of a damages\n947\n      See, e.g., Guadalupe-Blanco River Auth. v.

For example, future profit testimony that wholly fails to take into account risks\ninherent in the relevant activity is unsound - and therefore no evidence. 991 In Wyndham International,\nInc. v. ACE American Insurance Co., the Dallas Court of Appeals affirmed the exclusion of expert\n [*174] testimony on lost profits at a hotel resulting from the 9/11 terrorist attacks because the court\ndetermined that the expert lacked a reliable foundation. 992 The expert calculated the hotel’s lost profits\nby extrapolating from the hotel’s monthly forecasts of room revenues, and comparing the resulting\nforecast to actual room revenues. 993 The court noted that the expert failed to account for other factors\naffecting room revenues, such as the economic downturn, and for rebookings that would have offset\n\n985\n      Wells Fargo Bank Nw., N.A. v.

Manuel, the Fort Worth Court of Appeals held that a plaintiff’s\neconomist could rely on the defendant’s own sales forecasts as a predicate for calculating the plaintiff’s\nlost profit. 997 At trial, the defendant argued that the projections were ″not reliable″ and should not have\nbeen relied on by the economist in calculating lost profit damages. 998 The court held that the\ndefendant’s own witness had established the reliability of the projections, testifying that the document\nwas commonly used in the industry, represented the ″best number″ available, and was supported by\nextensive market research. 999 This case offers a reminder that a party challenging the predicative data\nof expert testimony may have difficulty when the expert uses that party’s own data.\n\nAnd in Rogers v. Alexander, the Dallas Court of Appeals held that an accountant’s opinion on the value\nof the company was reliable when the accountant explained why he used a particular [*175] multiplier\nto calculate the company’s value, what was common in the industry, and what factors he considered.\n1000\n\n\n\nvi. Safety Experts’ Predicates. The admissibility of testimony from ″safety″ experts is often decided\nunder other gates. For example, testimony from ″safety″ experts is not admissible if it is not helpful\nto the jury because the subject matter of the testimony is within the common knowledge and experience\nof average jurors. 1001 But opinion testimony of this nature can also be excluded based on the\ninadequacy of the expert’s predicate for forming an opinion. 1002 For example, the Fourteenth Court\nof Appeals upheld the exclusion of testimony from a workplace safety expert in a case involving an\nalleged on-the-job injury at a hospital that occurred when the employee was pushing a large food cart.\n994\n       Id. at 688.\n995\n       Id. at 689.\n996\n      Cf.

Property Owners’ Experiential Predicates. Under the property owner rule, a property owner is\nqualified to testify to the value of her property even if she would not be qualified to testify about the\nvalue of similar property belonging to someone else. 1007 The Texas Supreme Court recently held that\nwhen a property owner testifies to the value of his property, his opinion [*176] on value is functionally\nequivalent to expert testimony and thus, subject to the same reliability standards applicable to other\nexperts (though not the same qualification standards). 1008 Thus, a property owner must support her\nopinion about the value of her property with a sufficient predicate, such as ″evidence of price paid,\nnearby sales, tax valuations, appraisals, online resources, and any other relevant factors.″ 1009 Like any\nother expert, the property owner’s testimony can be based on inadmissible hearsay under appropriate\ncircumstances. 1010\n\n3. Inadmissible Predicates. 1011 Rule 703 of the Texas Rules of Evidence allows an expert to rely on\notherwise inadmissible hearsay or other evidence only if the underlying facts or data are ″of a type\nreasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.″ 1012 Thus, the text of Rule 703 requires the\nexpert to satisfy two requirements to form an opinion based on inadmissible evidence. First, the facts\nor data relied upon by the expert must be the type relied upon by experts in the field. Second, the\nexpert’s reliance must be reasonable. 1013 ″It is not sufficient for the court simply to ascertain that other\n1003\n       Moore, 140 S.W.3d at 876.\n1004\n       Id.\n1005\n       Id.\n1006\n       Id.\n1007\n       Porras v.

Not surprisingly, some decisions emphasize that courts must\ndecide independently whether the underlying information satisfies the reasonable reliance standard\nwhile others suggest that courts play a deferential role in deciding only whether experts in the field rely\non such information. 1017\n\nThe first requirement - customary reliance in the field - is insufficient by itself because, while courts\n″should give weight to the collective judgment of others in the field,″ that judgment is not\ndeterminative. 1018 Under the second requirement, the proponent of the evidence must demonstrate the\nreasonableness of such reliance in the instant case - reliance on certain types of evidence may be\nreasonable in some circumstances but not others. A court is not required to accept an expert’s assurance\nthat experts in the field reasonably rely on inadmissible information. 1019 As explained by the First\nCircuit, Rule 703 requires a trial judge to ″act as an independent ″gatekeeper’ to ensure that there is\nsufficient, credible evidence that experts do rely on the specified types of sources in formulating their\nopinions.″ 1020 An expert’s blind reliance on documents provided by a party is not reasonable. 1021 The\n\nfield and that such items are sufficiently trustworthy to make such reliance reasonable″); 3 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra note 187, § 7:16,\nat 856 (stating that Rule 703 requires a dual inquiry of reliance and adequacy).\n1014\n       4 Weinstein & Berger, supra note 27, § 703.04[2], at 703-10.1 to 703-11.\n1015\n        In re Paoli R.R.

App. - Fort Worth 2008, pet. ref’d).\n1027\n        See Tex. R. Evid. 703 (″The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those\nperceived by, reviewed by, or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the\nparticular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.″). The federal\nrule is similar but not identical. See Fed. R. Evid. 703 (″An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has\nbeen made aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in\nforming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted. But if the facts or data would otherwise\nbe inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them to the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the\nopinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.″). The Advisory Committee’s notes to the federal rule draw a distinction between\nRule 702 and Rule 703:\nThere has been some confusion over the relationship between Rules 702 and 703. The amendment makes clear that the sufficiency of\nthe basis of an expert’s testimony is to be decided under Rule 702. Rule 702 sets forth the overarching requirement of reliability, and\nan analysis of the sufficiency of the expert’s basis cannot be divorced from the ultimate reliability of the expert’s opinion. In contrast,\nthe ″reasonable reliance″ requirement of Rule 703 is a relatively narrow inquiry. When an expert relies on inadmissible information, Rule\n703 requires the trial court to determine whether that information is of a type reasonably relied on by other experts in the field. If so,\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 137 of 230\n                                                      52 Hous. L. Rev. 1, *179\n\nmalpractice case-within-a-case claim can determine ″the real-world settlement value″ of claims in a\nmass tort litigation. 1028 The Court held that the rule is satisfied\n\nwhen, in a mass tort litigation involving thousands of similar claimants and arising out of the same\nevent, the expert measures the ″true″ settlement value of a particular case by persuasively comparing\nall the circumstances of the case to the settlements obtained in other cases with similar circumstances\narising from the event. 1029\n\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals has also addressed Rule 703 once in a majority, published opinion in\nthe past fifteen years. In Leonard v. State, the Court held that the trial court erred in failing to exclude\nthe inadmissible and unreliable evidence relied on by the expert. 1030 The appeal arose from a trial\ncourt’s decision to revoke community supervision that was ordered after a defendant entered into a plea\nbargain. 1031 The terms of the community supervision required the defendant to successfully complete\na sex-offender treatment program and honestly [*180] complete polygraph examinations. 1032 A\npsychotherapist testified not only to the defendant’s discharge from the program, but also that the\nreason for his discharge was his failed polygraph examinations. 1033 The Court held that the trial court\nerred in admitting the psychotherapist’s testimony concerning the otherwise inadmissible evidence -\nthe failure of polygraph examinations - that formed the basis for his opinion that the defendant was\ndishonest, which in turn was the reason for his discharge from a sex-offender program. 1034 The expert\ntestified that experts in his field customarily rely on polygraph results to form opinions about a sex\noffender’s treatment. 1035\n\nThe Court stated that polygraph results are unreliable and inadmissible and ruled that this cannot be\nevaded by Rule 703. 1036 Under Rule 703, an expert can rely on inadmissible evidence only when it\nis reasonable to do so: ″The use of [the word] ″reasonably’ rather than ″customarily’ or ″regularly’\nimplies\n\nthe expert can rely on the information in reaching an opinion. However, the question whether the expert is relying on a sufficient basis\nof information - whether admissible information or not - is governed by the requirements of Rule 702.\nFed. R.

State observed that when a trial court admits otherwise\ninadmissible evidence under Rule 705(d), a great danger exists that ″the jury will consider the facts and\ndata as substantive evidence rather than as merely constituting the underlying basis for the expert’s\nopinion.″ 1079 Allowing the defendant’s mitigation expert to explain that he relied on inadmissible\nhearsay in the form of a videotaped interview of the defendant’s mother concerning his stepfather’s\nabuse created this danger. The Court also said that the expert did not need evidence of the interview\nitself for a legitimate purpose, which supported the trial court’s determination. 1080\n\nIn Resendiz v.

For example, the Fort Worth Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court’s refusal to allow\na defendant to cross-examine a police detective regarding the defendant’s statements to the detective.\n1086\n     The court of appeals observed that there was a danger that the ″statements would be used for a\npurpose - that is, as substantive evidence - other than as an explanation or support for″ the detective’s\nopinion. 1087 Additionally, the defendant admitted that the value of the statement was ″as substantive\nevidence″ of his own self-defense claim. 1088\n\nParties may try to use Rule 705(d) to present expert opinions from an expert who for various reasons\ndoes not testify at trial or from a nondesignated, nontestifying expert through a testifying expert who\nrelied on the second expert. 1089 One federal court prohibited an expert from recounting the opinions\nof another expert who did not, and was not expected to, testify during the [*188] trial. 1090 Another\npermitted such testimony when the other expert died before trial and the two experts’ investigations\noverlapped. 1091 But the San Antonio Court of Appeals held that a trial court did not abuse its discretion\n1081\n       Resendiz, 112 S.W.3d at 544-46.\n1082\n       Id. at 544-45.\n1083\n       Id. at 545.\n1084\n       See Wood v.

Instead, he testified that he had read an article, or had talked to gang members in custody\n(including, on at least one occasion, a gang member arrested as part of this investigation), or listened\nto a recording (evidence that could have been played to the jury in its original form, notwithstanding\nthat some informants may have been identified in the process). This testimony strongly suggests that\n[the witness] was acting not as an expert but instead as a case agent … . 1103\n                                                                      1104\nThe expert’s testimony therefore violated Rule 703.\n\nProfessor Mueller observes that the distinction of when the expert is merely describing the basis for\nan opinion and when the expert is acting as a conduit for presenting otherwise [*190] inadmissible\ninformation is ″sometimes hard to draw,″ particularly when the inadmissible information is a major\nbasis for the expert’s opinion. 1105 To make the distinction ″calls for considered judgment that there\nis enough of the expert’s own independent appraisal in what he proposes to say to make his testimony\nuseful and reliable by the force or weight of his own authority.″ 1106 Thus, a court must attempt to\ndistinguish whether the expert’s primary purpose for providing this particular support for an opinion\nis to disclose his reliance on others or merely to ″repeat[] what others say.″ 1107 In any event, an expert\nshould not be able to prove the inadmissible information unless the expert adds ″special insights of his\nown.″ 1108\n\nProfessor Goode goes even farther than Professor Mueller; he states, ″It is often simply impossible to\ndisentangle the explanatory value of the otherwise inadmissible hearsay from its substantive use.″ 1109\nProfessor Goode cites as illustrative of this problem the trial court’s decision to allow a medical\nexaminer to read several affidavits relied on to conclude that the victim died as a result of homicidal\nviolence. 1110 After cross-examination questioned the veracity of the affidavits and the expert testified\non redirect that the statements ″were the kinds of statements that you would typically rely upon in your\njob as a medical examiner in arriving at a conclusion in terms of cause of death,″ the State was\n1101\n       Id.\n1102\n       United States v.

If these\nhearsay statements were true, the medical examiner’s opinion that the victim’s death was a homicide\nis strengthened; if they were false, it is undermined. 1115\n\nRecognizing these types of dangers, the Second Circuit carefully distinguished between allowing a\npolice officer to rely on hearsay to form an opinion and allowing the officer to regurgitate the hearsay\nto the jury. 1116 The court held that a police officer could rely on hearsay statements made by gang\nmembers during custodial and noncustodial interviews, statements made by other law enforcement\nofficers, intercepted telephone conversations, and printed and online materials because law enforcement\nofficers ″routinely and reasonably rely upon hearsay in reaching their conclusions.″ 1117 But the\nadmissibility of the opinion does not mean the expert may ″transmit hearsay to the jury.″ 1118\n\nThe court did not use the federal balancing test. Instead, the court examined whether the expert formed\nan opinion by applying his experience or a reliable methodology to the inadmissible hearsay. 1119 If the\nexpert does not apply his experience or a reliable methodology to the otherwise inadmissible data, the\nexpert is simply parroting impermissible hearsay evidence, thereby ″allowing [a party] ″to circumvent\nthe rules prohibiting hearsay.’″ 1120 The Second Circuit ruled that the district court had abused its\ndiscretion in allowing testimony from one of the government’s expert witnesses regarding gang\n1111\n       Moulton, 360 S.W.3d at 564.\n1112\n       Id. at 565.\n1113\n       Id. at 547-48.\n1114\n       Id. at 566.\n1115\n       2 Goode, Wellborn & Sharlot, supra note 114, § 705.3, at 32 (Supp. 2014).\n1116\n       United States v.

The court explained that an expert may rely on the assistants without the\nassistants testifying but the ″analysis becomes more complicated if the assistants … exercise\nprofessional judgment that is beyond the expert’s ken.″ 1128 A well-credentialed scientist ″is not\npermitted to be the mouthpiece of a scientist in a different specialty.″ 1129\n\n[*193] The First Circuit held in a medical malpractice case that a trial court did not err in overruling\na defendant-surgeon’s hearsay objection to expert testimony regarding findings in published literature,\nand thereby permitted the expert to evade the limitations on the use of authoritative literature set forth\nin Rule 803(18). 1130 The expert was asked whether he was familiar with the literature about scarring\n1121\n       Id. at 198.\n1122\n       Turner v.

While it may be that [the] expert opinion was formed, in part, on the basis of the published\nworks of … other researchers, scholarly literature is information reasonably relied upon by medical\nexperts.″ 1136 The court’s analysis, unfortunately, addresses only the first prong of Rule 703’s dual\nstandard - whether scholarly literature is the type of information reasonably relied on by experts, and\nignores the second prong - whether it is reasonable for the expert to rely on the literature. To answer\nthis second inquiry, the court should have examined whether reliance on the particular article was\nreasonable before it permitted the expert to buttress his own research and experience with reference to\nresearch of others. 1137 But in another case, the court [*194] used the balancing test to hold that an\nEPA report was not admissible. 1138\nc.

When the underlying facts or data are\ndisclosed, they may be considered by you to aid you in determining (if it does so) the weight, if any,\nto be given the testimony of the expert at trial and his credibility; but such underlying facts or data,\nif any, shall not be considered as tending to establish the alleged guilt of the defendant in this case. 1141\n\nIn a case arising from an order of commitment of a person found to be a sexually violent predator, the\nBeaumont Court of Appeals relied heavily on the trial court’s limiting instruction in holding that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed two experts to disclose that they based their\nopinion, that the defendant suffered from a behavioral abnormality that made him likely to engage in\na predatory act of sexual violence, in part on details about his prior sexual offenses. 1142 The details\nof [*195] the prior offenses were contained in various hearsay records reviewed by the experts. 1143\nThe trial court instructed the jury on the definition of hearsay and that the experts were relying on\nhearsay. 1144 The trial court further explained that this hearsay ″was presented to show you the basis\nof the experts’ opinion and to afford you the opportunity to decide the weight and the credibility to be\ngiven to the expert[s’] opinion but not as primary evidence for you to consider as being truthful.″ 1145\nWhen the hearsay was admitted a second time as a basis for an expert opinion, the judge informed the\njury that he was overruling the hearsay objection so the jurors could have the information to assess ″the\nbasis upon which his opinion is founded. And you can decide as you see fit about whether to consider\nhis opinion valid or not and how much weight should be given to it. But the hearsay portion is not\nprimary evidence for you to consider.″ 1146 The court of appeals held that ″the trial court could have\nreasonably concluded that the disclosure of the data at issue would be helpful to the jury because the\ndisclosure of the data would allow the jury to understand how the State’s experts had formed their\nrespective opinions.″ 1147 And because of its limiting instructions, ″the trial court’s decision to admit\nthe evidence at issue was not unfairly prejudicial.″ 1148\n\nFederal Rule 705 eliminates the need for a party to present the soundness of the expert’s opinion during\ndirect examination. 1149 The expert is only required to give a ″shorthand-direct.″ 1150 This rule grants\n1141\n       Depena v.

The wisdom of this approach rests on the notion\nthat the price of [*196] requiring the foundation to be laid first is simply too high, and obviously on\nthe idea that the mechanism of cross is adequate to the task of exposing any flaws in the expert’s\nreasoning… . It is faith in the skill of trial counsel, the power of the cross, and the skepticism, common\nsense, and critical faculties of judges and juries, that underlie the conclusion that the exposure of\nweakness or fatal deficiencies in expert testimony may be left to the calling party’s opponent. 1152\n\nNevertheless, this path is ″seldom taken.″ 1153 One reason is that ″Rule 705 does not exempt expert\ntestimony from the requirements of Rule 702 or permit decisions on admissibility to rest on credentials\nalone.″ 1154 Rule 705 focuses ″on the manner of presenting expert testimony to the factfinder, not on\nany obligation to clear the admissibility hurdle.″ 1155 If the expert never presents support for an\nopinion, the opinion may be stricken. 1156\n\n4. Conclusion. An expert opinion must be ″supported by an adequate foundation of relevant facts, data,\nor opinions,″ 1157 and courts must ″independently evaluate″ this predicate to ensure that it is reliable.\n1158\n      When the predicate for expert testimony is called sufficiently into question, ″the trial judge must\ndetermine whether the testimony has ″a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant\ndiscipline.’″ 1159 Ultimately, ″if the foundational data underlying opinion testimony are unreliable, an\nexpert will not be permitted to base an opinion on that data because any opinion drawn from that data\nis likewise unreliable.″ 1160 This is true even if the expert is well qualified, [*197] employs a reliable\nmethodology, and provides a well-reasoned connection between his opinion and the basis for it. In\nother words, like a math problem, an expert can employ the right formula and correctly perform the\nmath, but he will not get the right answer if he plugs the wrong numbers into the formula.

Methodological Reliability\n\nThe methodological reliability gate is based on three key cases - one decided by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt and two decided by the Texas Supreme Court. Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion in\nDaubert 1165 and the Texas Supreme Court’s opinions in Robinson 1166 and Havner, 1167 when an\nexpert’s methodology is not reliable, the resulting opinion and testimony is not ″knowledge″ and is\ninadmissible. 1168 Daubert refers to this reliability test as the [*198] ″evidentiary reliability″ test. 1169\nBecause this gate focuses primarily on the reliability of the expert’s methodology, we call this gate the\nmethodological reliability gate. 1170 This gate examines whether ″the testimony is the product of\nreliable principles and methods.″ 1171\n\n1. Overview of Pre-2000 Cases. In Daubert, the Supreme Court rejected Frye 1172 as well as ″the\nlet-it-all-in standard in favor of a new reliability standard.″ 1173 The Court made four ″general\nobservations″ of factors to be examined under that reliability standard: 1174\n\n1161\n       See, e.g., Hous.

These two questions usually will lead to the same result. That which has a strong scientific\nfoundation usually will be generally accepted; that which has a weak scientific foundation usually will not be widely accepted. In those\nsituations, both standards will admit or both will exclude. But sometimes the two will diverge. When asserted knowledge is sound but\nnot generally accepted, Daubert permits its admission while Frye does not… . When asserted knowledge has not been shown to be sound,\nbut nevertheless has gained general acceptance in the field, then Daubert excludes even though Frye would admit… . Put most simply,\nDaubert sets a higher threshold for admissibility in some circumstances and a lower threshold under other circumstances.\n1 Faigman et al., supra note 246, § 1:15, at 49-51.\n1173\n       Bernstein, supra note 246, at 41.\n1174\n       Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94.\n1175\n       Id.\n1176\n       Id.\n1177\n       Id. at 594.\n1178\n       Id. at 594 (citations omitted).\n1179\n       Id. at 593.\n1180\n       Imwinkelried, supra note 881, at 962.\n1181\n       Id. at 974.\n1182\n       Id. at 962-63.\n1183\n        Id.

In Daubert, the Court focused on whether the expert opinion reflected\n″scientific knowledge″ and examined expert opinions ″derived by the scientific method″ and whether their work product amounted to\n″good science.″ Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593. For example, the testing factor was specifically tied to scientific knowledge: courts must\ndetermine ″whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact [by determining] whether it can be (and\nhas been) tested.″ Id. at 593.

L. Rev. 1, *199\n\nDespite its identification of these factors, the Supreme Court stressed that the inquiry envisioned by\nRule 702 is a ″flexible″ one. 1184 On remand, the Ninth Circuit added another factor for assessing\nreliability: whether the technique was derived through independent research or was developed for\nlitigation purposes. 1185 The Ninth Circuit noted the expert’s bald assurances that the opinions are\nbased on sound scientific techniques was insufficient; the expert had to offer some objective,\nindependent validation of that methodology. 1186\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court followed the lead of Daubert and adopted a reliability test for scientific\nexpert testimony in E.I. du [*200] Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson. 1187 A horticulturalist testified\nthat a fungicide was contaminated with an herbicide and that the application of the contaminated\nfungicide damaged the Robinsons’ pecan trees. 1188 The methodology he used to reach this opinion\nincluded visual inspections and ″comparative symptomology.″ 1189 He did not conduct any soil or\ntissue testing or test the fungicide. 1190\n\nThe Court announced a general rule that expert testimony must be ″based upon a reliable foundation.″\n1191\n     Trial judges act as gatekeepers who have a ″heightened responsibility to ensure that expert\ntestimony shows some indicia of reliability.″ 1192 For evidence involving scientific techniques or\nprinciples, the evidence must be ″grounded ″in the methods and procedures of science.’″ 1193 The\nCourt adopted six factors that a trial court ″may consider″ for determining reliability under Rule 702\nbut stressed that the factors are both flexible and nonexhaustive. 1194 These factors include all four of\nthose identified in Daubert, the additional factor identified by the Ninth Circuit upon remand in\nDaubert II, and the extent to which the technique relies upon the subjective interpretation of the expert\n\n1184\n       Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594.\n1185\n       See Daubert II, 43 F.3d at 1317. The court explained:\nThat an expert testifies for money does not necessarily cast doubt on the reliability of his testimony, as few experts appear in court merely\nas an eleemosynary gesture. But in determining whether proposed expert testimony amounts to good science, we may not ignore the fact\nthat a scientist’s normal workplace is the lab or the field, not the courtroom or the lawyer’s office.\n\nId.\n1186\n       Id. at 1316.\n1187\n       E.I. du Point de Nemours & Co. v.

Moreover, ″it is not always a straightforward exercise to disaggregate method and\nconclusion.″ 1199 The U.S. Supreme Court in Joiner later clarified its statement, declaring that\n″conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from one another″ and that nothing in ″Daubert\nor the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected\nto existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.″ 1200 The Texas Supreme Court followed suit in\nGammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc. 1201\n\nApplying these factors in Robinson, the Texas Supreme Court held that the expert’s ″methodology″\nwas unreliable. 1202 For example, his comparative symptomology method failed four of these factors:\nit (1) had not been subjected to peer review or [*202] publication; (2) had no known rate of error; (3)\n\n\n\n1195\n       Id.; see Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94; Daubert II, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685671\"><a href=\"/opinion/685671/william-daubert-joyce-daubert-individually-and-as-guardians-ad-litem-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995).\n1196\n       Robinson, 923 S.W.2d at 558-59.

Subsequent Development of Factors for Assessing Methodological Reliability. Trial courts are\ngranted a great deal of deference in selecting and applying the factors to determine the reliability of\nan expert’s methodology 1217 because the listed factors may not be relevant, and therefore, are not\nmandatory. 1218 Indeed, one Texas court of appeals stated, ″In non-scientific cases, it is impossible to\nset out specific criteria for evaluating the reliability of expert testimony, and, ultimately, the trial court\nhas discretion to determine how to assess reliability.″ 1219 Joiner [*204] emphasizes the trial court’s\ndiscretion in applying the Daubert factors. 1220 Kumho confers a deeper type of discretion on the trial\njudge - in the case of nonscientific expertise, discretion to select the factors to apply. 1221\n\n\n\n\n1215\n       Id. at 150.

If testing of critical aspects of an\nexpert’s testimony has not taken place … then an explanation of why it has not is an important\nconsideration in evaluating the expert opinions [*210] and determining whether they were\nsubstantively more than merely the expert’s conclusory, subjective opinion. 1260\nThe plaintiffs claimed that Whirlpool’s use of a corrugated tube in a dryer’s air-circulation system was\na design defect that allowed the tube to become clogged and caused lint to be discharged into the dryer\nwhere it was ignited by the heater element, which caused the clothes to catch on fire and spread to the\nrest of the house. 1261 The Whirlpool Court applied the Daubert factors to question the methodological\nreliability of the engineer’s opinion, observing that the engineer’s theory was developed for the\nlawsuit, had not been published or subjected to peer review, and had not been accepted as a valid theory\nby any part of a relevant scientific or expert community at large. 1262 The expert\nhad not seen or read of a test showing that a corrugated lint transport tube in a dryer properly vented\nsuch as the Camachos’ was, would become clogged with lint to the extent it backed lint up into the\nblower assembly. He did not personally test his theory. Nor did he test his theory that the lint would\nbe blown through the lint chute seal if the lint transport tube became clogged. 1263\nIn contrast, Whirlpool presented expert testimony supported by test results showing that any particles\nof lint that could pass through the dryer’s inlet grill would be much smaller than those in a report relied\n1257\n       Sappington v.

It is also worth noting that, while Whirlpool involved\na legal-sufficiency review, the defendant had properly preserved objections to the admissibility of the plaintiffs’ expert evidence. Thus,\na review of the expert’s methodology was not inconsistent with the Court’s previous holdings that ″when a reliability challenge requires\nthe court to evaluate the underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the expert, an objection must be timely made\nso that the trial court has the opportunity to conduct this analysis.″ City of San Antonio v.

Interestingly, the Court also stated that the trial court had discretion to determine the\nreliability of the expert’s opinion by applying five of the six Robinson factors without relying on the\nGammill analytical gap test. 1270 Because the Gammill analysis formed the basis for the court of\nappeals’ holding, the Court did not focus on these factors except to make it clear that both the Gammill\nand Daubert tests applied. 1271\n\nIn contrast, the Houston First Court of Appeals focused largely on the other Daubert factors in holding\nthat a professional fire investigator’s origin-of-fire opinion was sufficiently reliable, despite the\nabsence of testing, in part because fire investigation ″does not lend itself to testing.″ 1272 The [*212]\ncourt stated that the expert’s ″opinion fits the facts of the case and there [were] no significant analytical\ngaps in his testimony″ and was based on physical evidence, collected samples, burn patterns, damage\n1264\n       Id. at 640-41.\n1265\n        While the Court phrased the issue as whether Whirlpool conclusively disproved Camacho’s theory, it is probably better to describe\nthe issue as whether Whirlpool disproved it as a matter of law. Daubert recognizes the inherent uncertainty of the scientific enterprise.\nWhen an expert relies on inductive reasoning to investigate hypotheses about phenomena, the expert does not regard a proposition as\nconclusively validated because there is always another conceivable empirical test.

Research methods vary considerably, and some tests amount\nto no test at all.″ 1305\n\nAdditionally, an opposing party’s criticisms of the reliability of the testing or studies is sometimes\nviewed as a matter for cross-examination rather than admissibility. In Taber v. Roush, a Texas court of\nappeals held that criticism of the expert’s reliance on retrospective (rather than prospective) studies\nwas ″properly addressed by cross examination rather than exclusion″ because even though retrospective\nstudies are generally ″considered to be less reliable than prospective studies,″ there was a reasonable\nexplanation for the dearth of prospective studies on the subject. 1306 The Texas Supreme Court said in\nGammill,\n\nThe trial court’s gatekeeping function under Rule 702 does not supplant cross-examination as ″the\ntraditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.″ But neither does the\navailability of cross-examination relieve the trial court of its threshold responsibility under Rule 702\n″of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task\nat hand.″ 1307\n\nThe issue of whether testing - or the other Daubert factors - applied to an expert opinion on the\nsequence of an accident was [*218] addressed by the Texas Supreme Court in Ramirez. 1308 The Court\nfirst observed that the Daubert factors ″cannot be used with certain kinds of expert testimony″ and that\nsometimes an expert’s ″experience alone may provide a sufficient basis for″ an opinion. 1309 ″That,\nhowever, is not the circumstance in this case.″ 1310 The accident reconstructionist’s theory was that the\nleft rear wheel of the plaintiff’s vehicle could, and did, remain pocketed in its wheel well as the vehicle\nveered across the median, until its impact with another vehicle. 1311 According to the expert’s ″floating\nwheel theory,″ the wheel assembly broke before - not after - a collision with a motorist. 1312 The\nexpert’s theory flunked the first two Daubert tests: He did not conduct or cite any tests to support his\ntheory and did not identify any supporting publications for his theory. 1313 Nor did he explain how the\n\n\n\n\n1305\n       1 Faigman et al., supra note 246, § 1:17, at 55.\n1306\n       Taber v.

But while there is no absolute requirement of testing, this\nstatement could be read to make general acceptance the proxy for the methodological reliability\ninquiry, a proposition rejected in Daubert. 1318 That does not mean general acceptance is not\ncircumstantial evidence of the methodological soundness of the underlying theory. If a theory has\ngained widespread acceptance, presumably other experts have had a chance to review it, and the lack\nof any substantive criticism indicates the study was reliable. Nevertheless, it might be more accurate\nto qualify this statement by explaining that testing is not necessary if other evidence of reliability is\nsufficient or if the court may take judicial notice of reliability. 1319 If a methodology is well established,\nit may not be difficult to show that the methodology is reliable based on literature or nonjudicial uses.\n1320\n\n\n\nThe testing requirement can, nonetheless, be read too stringently. The testing to support the reliability\nof a methodology does not have to be the expert’s own testing; the expert may rely on testing by others.\n1321\n     The mere fact that an expert has never previously performed a test does not make the test results\n\n1314\n       Id. at 905-06.\n1315\n        See discussion of Ramirez in Part III.D (connective reliability) at infra notes 1616-33 and accompanying text.

Suppose, for example, that a prosecutor wants to offer testimony that a\ndrug dog’s alert indicated that there had been contraband drugs in a piece of luggage. A judge might\nask: How often have you seen Rex alert? In what percentage of those cases was there a follow-up\nsearch? And what percentage of those searches yielded the discovery of contraband drugs? 1379 In\nDaubert, the Court cites John Ziman’s book, Reliable Knowledge. 1380 Ziman’s point is that in order\nto determine the validity of a technique, an empiricist should often insist on proof of the results of the\nuse of the technique. 1381\n\n\n\n\n1375\n       E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v.

Third, the limited number of\nexperts who are actively working in a particular field constrains a party’s ability to shop for an expert\nwho will reach the desired conclusion. 1405\nOne federal court described this factor as one of the two primary criteria for establishing the reliability\nof scientific expert testimony. 1406\nFailure to satisfy this factor ″will not render an expert’s opinion unreliable per se, [but] ″opinions\nformed solely for the purpose of testifying are more likely to be biased toward a particular result.’″ 1407\nThis factor will have limited application in the case of some forensic sciences, where the techniques\ndo not have any nonjudicial applications.\n\ng.

For example, the\nexpert’s methodology will not be reliable when the expert fails ″to apply his own methodology [*235]\nreliably.″ 1424 Rejection of an expert’s theory by a peer-reviewed journal also supports a finding of lack\nof reliability. 1425 When an expert uses a methodology that he has never used before the litigation in\nquestion, that factor may suggest a lack of reliability. 1426 ″Talking off the cuff - deploying neither data\nnor analysis - is not an acceptable methodology.″ 1427 Similarly, common sense is not a reliable\n\n1418\n       Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v.

For example, an expert’s methodology is not necessarily\nunreliable simply because an opposing expert uses a different methodology. 1439 Under this [*237]\nprinciple, when opposing parties present physician experts with different theories of how a plaintiff’s\ninjury came about, if both theories are based on different but reliable methodologies, it is for the jury\nto decide which physician is most likely correct. 1440 In New Hampshire Insurance Co. v. Allison, both\nsides’ physicians agreed that the plaintiff died as a result of a rupture at the site of a plaque buildup\nin the plaintiff’s artery, which became blocked and caused a heart attack. 1441 The experts also agreed\nthat increased physical activity can increase the risk of heart attack. 1442 But they disagreed over\nwhether the plaintiff’s heart attack was caused by the plaintiff’s physical activity during his employer’s\n″fire training school.″ 1443 The defendant’s expert testified that the increased risk of heart attack after\nincreased physical activity only lasted for forty-five minutes, at which time the risk returned to\nbaseline. 1444 Because the plaintiff’s heart attack occurred more than forty-five minutes after his\nincreased activity during fire training, the expert concluded that the fire training had no correlation\nwith the heart attack. 1445 The plaintiff’s expert, on the other hand, opined that the plaintiff’s activity\nduring fire training caused his heart attack because, from a cardiac perspective, the plaintiff had been\nstable and asymptomatic up until the time of the training; he testified that there was a continuity of\nsymptoms from the time the fire training ended until the plaintiff had his heart attack. 1446 The\ndefendant argued that the plaintiff’s expert testimony was unreliable because it was contrary to the\n1437\n       Id.\n1438\n        Dix et al., supra note 1379, § 13, at 37 (stating that another test is ″whether there is a feedback loop, alerting a member of the\nprofession when she has erred.

L. Rev. 1, *239\n\nExpert testimony on legal matters offers a good example of when the Daubert factors may have limited\napplication. 1458 Such testimony ordinarily must be strictly limited because it is the job of the trial\njudge, not an expert, to determine what the law is and to instruct the jury accordingly. 1459 This presents\nsome unique problems.\n\n [*240] First, expert testimony on the law is an area of expertise where two generally applicable\nprinciples of judicial reliability review converge. The first general principle is that courts evaluate the\nreliability of an expert’s opinion by ″focusing solely on the underlying principles and methodology,″\nnot the correctness of the expert’s conclusions. 1460 The second general principle is that expert\ntestimony that is premised on an incorrect understanding of the law or on a legally incorrect theory is\nincompetent. 1461 Because of the overlap of these two principles, legal expert testimony is a rare\nspecimen in which courts must evaluate both the validity of the expert’s methodology and the\nsoundness of the expert’s legal conclusions. In evaluating the correctness of the expert’s legal\nconclusions, two Daubert factors may be helpful: whether the expert’s statement about the applicable\nlegal principle is reflected in publications and whether the expert has made statements about the legal\nprinciple in question in a nonjudicial setting. But those questions are asked for a different purpose than\nin a Daubert methodological inquiry; they are asked to determine the correctness of the expert’s\nstatement of law rather than the validity of the expert’s underlying methodology.\n1458\n       Legal expert testimony is frequently offered in two contexts: opinions relating to the reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s\nfees and opinions relating to the standard of care and causation in legal malpractice actions. Opinions about attorney’s fees are typically\nbased on the attorney’s experience and knowledge of the relevant legal market, and are discussed in the predicative-reliability section\nabove. See supra notes 895-920 and accompanying text. Judicial review of causation opinions in legal malpractice cases often focuses\non whether the legal expert provided an adequate and logically valid explanation of how and why the alleged breach of care caused the\nclaimant’s injury, as discussed in the connective-reliability section below.

Rev. 1, *240\n\nSecond, under the procedures commonly used in jury trials, the legal expert ″must testify before the\njury has received the jury charge and before it has been instructed on specific elements and standards\nconcerning specific claims. The lawyers, the expert, and the judge begin trial with knowledge of the\ngenerally applicable duties and their potential scope; the jurors do not.″ 1462 Thus, trial courts\nsometimes permit expert testimony on legal matters that provide needed context or background. There\nare two potential solutions to the problem of experts testifying on the law. First, in order to apply legal\nconcepts to the issues in the case, the expert may be given ″″some leeway’ to reference the controlling\n″legal terms’ and related concepts while testifying. Otherwise, a jury would not be able to make sense\nof the expert’s testimony or measure it against the charge’s requirements, and the sponsoring litigant\ncould not meet a motion for directed verdict.″ 1463 Under this procedure,\n [*241]\n\nthe standards governing admission of expert testimony do not automatically foreclose every reference\nto legal terms … . Such an expert properly may include these references when the trial court sets\nappropriate limits. The continuum of potentially relevant testimony from an expert likely will vary\naccording to the specific facts and the specific legal standards being litigated in specific cases. 1464\n                                                                                                                                        1465\nThus, the expert must be given some latitude but cannot ″testify without any limits whatsoever.″\nThe limits in that case are to ensure that the expert correctly identifies the legal principles.\nThere is another, and in the view of the Authors, better solution in many cases: give the portion of the\njury charge on the applicable legal principle immediately before the expert’s testimony and then limit\nthe expert to applying that law or explaining its rationale. This procedure has been successfully used\nin at least one jury trial. 1466 It is somewhat analogous to the trial court’s determination of the scope\nof patent claims ″as a matter of law″ after a Markman hearing. 1467 Admittedly, it requires more pretrial\nwork by the trial judge - although not a great deal more if the court ensures that the expert’s opinion\non the law is correct before admitting it. The larger problem is that evidence evolves during trials and\ntherefore the legal principles implicated by the evidence may likewise evolve as a trial progresses. But\nthis same weakness applies to expert testimony generally: if the evidence evolves in an unanticipated\nway after the expert testifies, the expert may need to be recalled as a witness. Another difficulty is that\n1462\n       Fleming, 395 S.W.3d at 928.\n1463\n       Id. at 928-29.\n1464\n       Id. at 929 (citation omitted).\n1465\n       Id.

As discussed above, an expert’s experiences sometimes provide\npredicative data for her opinion. 1468 In that instance, the expert must demonstrate that her experience,\ntogether with any other predicate for the opinion, offers a sound and probative basis for opinion. 1469\nWhen an expert’s experience forms part of the predicate for her opinion, courts sometimes speak of\nexperience as a means of assessing methodological reliability in addition to - or on rare occasion, in\nsubstitution for - the Daubert factors. 1470 We suggest that the applicability of the Daubert factors is\ngoverned by the same test regardless of whether the expert’s opinion is predicated in whole or in part\non the expert’s training and experience: ″[A] trial court should consider the [Daubert] factors … when\ndoing so will be helpful in determining reliability of an expert’s testimony, regardless of whether the\ntestimony is scientific in nature or experience-based.″ 1471\nExperience can be subject to some of the Daubert factors - for example, if the expert ever tested her\nexperience, published her experience, or had any experience on this issue outside litigation. 1472 The\nDaubert factors ″may or may not be pertinent in assessing reliability, depending on the nature of the\nissue, the expert’s particular expertise, and the subject of his [*243] testimony.″ 1473 In other\nsituations, however, the Daubert factors will not be helpful. 1474 In most situations, the focus of an\ninquiry into the expert’s experiences is best viewed not as a Daubert factor for reviewing reliability but\nas predicate data, the sufficiency of which must be analyzed by its quantity and similarity to the\nquestion at issue and perhaps its temporal proximity to the events in question.\n1468\n       See supra Part III.B.2.c.i.\n1469\n       See supra Part III.B.2.c.i.\n1470\n       See Whirlpool Corp. v.

Ford Motor Co., in which a plaintiff asserted that his asthma was caused by chemicals\nreleased when his airbag deployed during a car accident, a Texas court of appeals held that a treating\nphysician could not rely on his physical examination of the plaintiff, his review of medical literature,\nand his experience treating two other patients with similar symptoms to reach a reliable opinion on\ncausation. 1486 The court first rejected the expert’s reliance on his physical examination of the plaintiff:\n″A treating physician’s assertion that a physical examination confirmed causation should not be\naccepted at face value.″ 1487 The court observed that the expert did not state whether his theory\nsatisfied any of the Daubert factors. 1488 The court rejected the expert’s reliance on medical literature\nbecause the expert failed to identify what literature he read or whether the literature consisted of\npeer-reviewed studies. 1489 With regard to the expert’s reliance on his experience treating other\npatients, the court stated that the expert’s ″treatment of those two patients and [the plaintiff] does not\nqualify as a scientific study that meets the statistical requirements of Havner or that can be tested or\nreviewed by [the expert’s] peers.″ 1490 The court recognized the ″widespread acceptance″ of the\ndifferential diagnosis technique in the medical industry but discredited the expert’s use of that\nmethodology because the expert failed to properly perform the ″ruling out″ step of eliminating other\nplausible causes of the injury. 1491\nThe Texas Supreme Court has indicated that only in ″very few cases″ will courts be able to assess\nreliability based on the Daubert factors to the exclusion of the expert’s experience or based on the\nexpert’s experience to the exclusion of the Daubert [*246] factors; both should be reviewed. 1492 In\nthose rare cases when courts may assess methodological reliability based solely on experience, we\nsuggest that the court is not substituting the qualifications gate for the methodological reliability gate;\ninstead, the methodology employed by the expert is, in fact, the observational gathering of empirical\ndata through experience - a methodology that may (or may not) be valid for reaching a particular\n1482\n       Id.\n1483\n       Id.\n1484\n       Id. at 218 (alterations omitted) (quoting Viterbo v.

Expert opinions on the standard of care are based on the ordinary negligence standard\nof care, an issue that juries ordinarily can evaluate without expert assistance, as modified in light of\nthe defendant’s expertise, a modification that typically requires expert explanation. 1494 The\ndetermination of what is reasonable under a given set of circumstances involves a normative analysis,\nnot readily susceptible to the scientific [*247] method, 1495 but this is not troubling because the jury\nitself is considered well equipped to make such normative judgments. 1496 What expert testimony\nbrings to the table in these instances is the expert’s specialized knowledge, training, and experience,\nwhich is consistent with the defendant’s relevant knowledge, training, and experience; 1497 thus, in\nopining on the applicable standard of care, the expert necessarily relies on such knowledge, training,\nand experience as a predicate.

Rev. 1, *249\n\n [*249] Expert opinions by physicians offer a good example: a broad statement that physicians can or\ncannot reach opinions based on their experience should be avoided because the reliability of the\nexperience depends on how the physician is using this data. 1503 When a physician testifies about the\nstandard of care, that opinion is generally based at least in part on the physician’s own experiences,\n1504\n     and the gathering of those experiences could be described very generally as a methodology. When\nphysicians testify about an expected outcome from certain medical devices, prescription drugs, or\nphysical ailments based on their patients’ outcomes under similar conditions, the predicate data may\nprovide a sufficiently reliable basis provided the expert has an adequate quantity of experience. 1505\nWhen a physician testifies about causation based on a differential diagnosis, courts often require the\nphysician’s initial determination of general causation in which the physician identifies all relevant\npotential causes of the subject’s symptoms to have a more reliable predicate than simply experience\nbut are often more accepting of experience as a reliable predicate for eliminating likely alternative\ncauses. 1506 Some argue that physicians are not in the business of diagnosing cause; they are in the\nbusiness of treating patients. 1507 But [*250] sometimes physicians’ treatment decisions require them\nto determine the cause of an ailment. Thus, the type of opinion offered by the physician may impact\nthe scrutiny to which it is subjected and whether the Daubert factors will apply.\n\nAccident reconstructionists are an excellent example of experts who use predicative data, methodology,\nand logical reasoning to reach subsidiary opinions that lead to an ultimate opinion on the cause of an\naccident. The Texas Supreme Court has stated that the Robinson factors ″are particularly difficult to\napply in vehicular accident cases involving accident reconstruction.″ 1508 With regard to an accident\nwas developed for litigation purposes by examining whether the expert has ever claimed this experience outside a litigation setting, such\nas in speeches or in training of other experts.\n1503\n     We discuss physicians’ use of experience as a predicate for opinion evidence in the previous section.

Clark below, reconstructionists often rely heavily on\nextrapolations from predicate data. 1512 Thus, their opinions often are best analyzed under connective\nreliability and predicative reliability gates. 1513 For these two gates, the Daubert [*251] factors do not\napply (except possibly to the extent the predicate data include literature subject to review for the\nauthor’s methodology). Instead, courts should examine predicative and connective reliability. As for all\nexperts it is important to analyze each opinion of the accident reconstructionist separately; thus, when\na reconstructionist cannot reliably create the entire accident sequence, she might still reliably recreate\npart of the accident.\n\nOpinions by accident reconstructionists are also a good reminder that the three reliability gates are\ninterlocking and may overlap. 1514 A reconstructionist’s use of photographs to reach an opinion on\nvarious aspects of an accident could be called a methodology, which could under certain conditions be\ntested and published. 1515 But reaching conclusions from that data is also a logical reasoning process\nand therefore fits under the connective reliability gate. One reason that the gates interlock is that an\nexpert’s reasoning process could also be described as a methodology. For example, ″extrapolating from\nanimal studies″ could be described as a ″very general methodology.″ 1516\nsubjective interpretation; (3) the methodology’s potential rate of error; (4) whether the underlying theory or methodology has been\ngenerally accepted as valid by the accident reconstruction and post-collision fire investigation community; and (5) the non-judicial uses\nthat have been made of his methodology. These are similar to factors 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of those enumerated in Robinson. But, as we have\nsaid above, that is not to imply that the trial court was precluded from measuring Elwell’s methodology by Gammill’s analytical gap\nanalysis.″).\n1509\n       TXI Transp., 306 S.W.3d at 238.\n1510\n       Id.\n1511\n       Ford Motor Co. v.

Differential Diagnosis (Etiology). 1517 Differential diagnosis is a ″routine diagnostic method used in\ninternal medicine whereby a treating physician formulates a hypothesis [*252] as to likely causes of\na patient’s presented symptoms and eliminates unlikely causes by a deductive process of elimination.″\n1518\n     Differential diagnosis is a two-step process: first, the physician considers all relevant potential\ncauses of a patient’s symptoms (often referred to as ″ruling in″ potential causes); second, the physician\neliminates all but one potential cause or all but one set of integrated causes (often referred to as ″ruling\nout″ potential causes). 1519 Differential diagnosis is a well-accepted technique in the medical field and\nwhen performed by a treating physician, is not subject to the same heightened risk of bias that plagues\nepidemiological studies. 1520\n\nMany jurisdictions, including Texas, have recognized differential diagnosis as a suitable methodology\nby which medical experts can demonstrate specific causation. 1521 But ″the results of a differential\ndiagnosis are far from reliable per se.″ 1522 As one court has explained:\n\nCalling something a ″differential diagnosis″ or ″differential etiology″ does not by itself answer the\nreliability question but prompts three more: (1) Did the expert make an accurate diagnosis of the nature\nof the disease? (2) Did the expert reliably rule in the possible causes of it? (3) Did the expert reliably\n1517\n       This factor is sometimes referred to as differential diagnosis for physicians but it is more accurately described as differential\netiology because it is an attempt to use process-of-elimination reasoning to identify a cause. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical & Emotional Harm § 28 cmt. (c)(4) (2010) (″Courts frequently refer to the elimination of other known causes for a plaintiff\nby employing the medical terminology of ″differential diagnosis.’ … This technique is more accurately described as a ″differential\netiology.’″); Joseph Sanders & Julie Machal-Fulks, The Admissibility of Differential Diagnosis Testimony to Prove Causation in Toxic\nTort Cases: The Interplay of Adjective and Substantive Law, 64 Law & Contemp.

In Turner v. Iowa Fire Equipment Co., the court stated that the treating\nphysician testified about a medical differential diagnosis - the identification of the condition in order to determine its treatment - but not\nabout the a differential diagnosis, the identification of the condition’s cause.

If the court [*253] answers ″no″ to any of these questions, the court must\nexclude the ultimate conclusion reached. 1523\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has likewise rejected an argument for a ″less strict″ application of the\nRobinson factors to differential diagnosis evidence: ″The mere fact that differential diagnosis was used\ndoes not exempt the foundation of a treating physician’s expert opinion from scrutiny - it is to be\nevaluated for reliability as carefully as any other expert’s testimony.″ 1524\n\nOften the testifying expert is a treating physician who made the diagnosis, or a retained expert who\nmakes the diagnosis for purposes of the litigation by reviewing the claimant’s medical records. In\neither instance, the reliability review of the differential diagnosis focuses on the testifying expert’s own\nmethodology. 1525 But when the expert relies on some other source to ″rule in″ potential causes or to\n″rule out″ likely alternative causes, the other source will need to provide a reliable predicate for the\nexpert’s decision to include/exclude the potential cause. 1526\n\nThe first step in the differential-diagnosis technique, ″ruling in″ potential causes, overlaps the issue of\n″general causation″ - a [*254] physician cannot reliably identify a substance as a potential cause of\na patient’s injury if the substance does not cause that type of injury. The second step, ″ruling out″\npotential causes, focuses on a patient’s particular circumstances and thus addresses the narrower issue\nof ″specific causation.″ Differential-diagnosis evidence thus encompasses both general and specific\ncausation. Sometimes, a claimant will produce separate evidence of general causation to justify the\nexpert’s decision to ″rule in″ the substance in question as a potential cause of the claimant’s illness or\n\n\n1523\n       Tamraz, 620 F.3d at 674.\n1524\n        Crump, 330 S.W.3d at 216-17. On the other hand, some federal courts have indicated that a physician’s differential diagnosis\ntestimony may be afforded greater leeway in reliance on the physician’s experience and expertise. The Ninth Circuit recently held in\nMessick v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. that a district court erred in excluding a differential diagnosis where a physician ″repeatedly\nreferred to his own extensive clinical experience as the basis for his differential diagnosis, as well as his examination of [the plaintiff’s]\nrecords, treatment, and history.″ Messick v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1198-99 (9th Cir. 2014). The court opined that\n″medicine partakes of art as well as science, and there is nothing wrong with a doctor relying on extensive clinical experience when\nmaking a differential diagnosis… . A doctor using a differential diagnosis grounded in significant clinical experience and examination\nof medical records and literature can certainly aid the trier of fact and cannot be considered to be offering ″junk science.’″ Id. The court\nstated that the expert was not obligated to ″identify the sole cause of a medical condition in order for his or her testimony to be reliable.\nIt is enough that a medical condition be a substantial causative factor.″ Id. at 1199.\nOther courts have been somewhat less deferential. In Bland v. Verizon Wireless, (VAW) L.L.C., for example, the Eighth Circuit held that\na physician’s testimony that the plaintiff’s ingestion of freon caused her exercise-induced asthma was unreliable because the physician\nfailed to investigate the home or other environments to determine other possible causes of asthma and most cases of exercise-induced\nasthma have no known cause.

But when there is not already\nreliable evidence of ″general causation,″ a differential-diagnosis expert will have to identify an\nadequate predicate for concluding that the substance in question is capable of causing the kind of injury\nsuffered by the claimant before the expert can ″rule in″ that substance as a potential cause. 1528 An\nexpert cannot rely on differential diagnosis evidence ″to circumvent the requirement of general\ncausation.″ 1529\nLikewise, a testifying physician cannot rely on evidence of general causation to bypass a reliable basis\nfor specific causation. 1530 Under Robinson and Havner, expert causation evidence - including expert\ncausation opinions based on a differential diagnosis technique (or any etiology technique) 1531 - [*255]\nmust adequately rule out other potential causes to provide any basis for a causation conclusion. 1532\nIn Crump, the Texas Supreme Court explained the parameters of this requirement:\nIn some cases, a physician’s differential diagnosis may be too dependent upon the physician’s\nsubjective guesswork or produce too great a rate of error - for example, when there are several\n1527\n      See Hollander v.

Still, if evidence presents ″other plausible causes of the\ninjury or condition that could be negated, the [proponent of the testimony] must offer evidence\nexcluding those causes with reasonable certainty.″ 1533\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has stated that ″a thorough occupational/exposure history and medical\nhistory″ are ″vitally important″ to the ruling-out step of differential diagnosis. 1534\n\nThe ruling-in step of the differential diagnosis process may be too dependent on guess work when a\nsignificant number of the incidents of the disease in question are attributed to idiopathic (i.e., [*256]\nunknown) causes. On remand, the district court in Milward 1535 excluded the testimony of an expert\nwho attempted to use a differential diagnosis technique to conclude that the plaintiff’s AML was\ncaused by exposure to the defendant’s product because the expert could not reliably eliminate other\nprobable causes of AML. 1536 The court stated that the ″fundamental problem with differential\ndiagnosis in this context″ was that ″between 70 and 80 percent of cases of AML are idiopathic -\nmeaning they have no known cause.″ 1537 The court observed:\n\nWhen a disease has a discrete set of causes, eliminating some number of them significantly raises the\nprobability that the remaining option or options were the cause-in-fact of the disease. The same cannot\nbe said when eliminating a few possible causes leaves not only fewer possible causes but also a high\nprobability that a cause cannot be identified. 1538\n\nAt least one Texas appellate court has likewise indicated that when a disease is frequently idiopathic,\nit may be more difficult for an expert to reliably determine causation through differential diagnosis.\n1539\n\n\n\n3. Conclusion. Courts cannot mechanically use the Daubert factors as a checklist (e.g., ″reliability wins\nby a score of 4 to 2″). The factors are too flexible, sometimes overlap, and often need to be\nsupplemented with other factors for such a rule. More importantly, as courts have gradually\nrecognized, the crucial question is whether the expert has presented enough empirical data and\nreasoning to validate the proposition that by using this theory or technique he can accurately draw the\nproposed specific inference in question.\n1533\n     Transcon.

The Court observed that the expert failed ″to show how his observations, assuming they were valid,\nsupported his conclusions,″ leaving a fatal ″analytical gap″ in the process that produced the expert’s opinion. Id. at 727.\n\nIn adopting Joiner, the Gammill Court quotes Havner, which dealt in part with expert reliance on animal studies to support a conclusion\nrelating to causation in humans, similar to the excluded testimony in Joiner. See Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 729-30. Because it predated\nJoiner and Gammill, Havner rejected the expert testimony presented under a predicative-reliability analysis, concluding that the\nepidemiological studies and animal studies on which the expert relied did not provide an adequate basis for his opinions. See id. at 730.\nThe Havner Court’s analysis of the expert’s reliance on epidemiological studies is well-suited for the predicative-reliability gate - the\nepidemiological studies reached ″just the opposite″ conclusion on causation than the expert did, and they therefore provided no support\nfor his conclusion. Id. But the Court’s analysis of the expert’s reliance on animal studies would have been better-suited for the\nconnective-reliability gate later developed in Joiner and Gammill - studies evidencing causation in animals (as opposed to studies failing\nto find any evidence of causation in humans) could support an expert’s conclusion on causation in humans if the expert adequately\nbridged the ″gap″ between the animal-related data and the human-related opinion by, for example, providing adequately supported\ntestimony demonstrating substantial similarity between animals and humans with regard to the effect of the substance in question and\nthe etymology of the disease in question.\n1543\n       The phrase ″connective reliability″ is based on the Joiner opinion, which was quoted with approval by Gammill: ″Nothing in either\nDaubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a … court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the\nipse dixit of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.″\nJoiner, 522 U.S. at 146 (cited with approval by Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 726) (emphasis added); see also Ronald J. Allen & Joseph S.\nMiller, The Common Law Theory of Experts: Deference or Education?, 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1131, 1136-37 (1993) (arguing evidentiary\nrules should force experts to educate jury on reasons for expert’s opinion so jury can make its own intelligent decision, not keep\ninformation from the jury and thus force jury to blindly defer to or reject expert’s inferences).\n1544\n       Kimberly S.

L. Rev. 1, *258\n\nverdict. In the wake of Joiner and Gammill, the ″ipse dixit″ and ″analytical gap″ language has echoed\nthroughout hundreds of Texas expert opinion cases. 1545 Most of these cases involve postjudgment\nlegal-sufficiency challenges to expert evidence, rather than prejudgment challenges to the admissibility\nof the evidence. Typically, the party who lost at trial argues that the expert testimony offered by the\nprevailing party to prove an element of his cause of action is conclusory - it is the ″mere ipse dixit of\na credentialed witness″ and ″there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the\nopinion proffered″ - and therefore the testimony constitutes ″no evidence″ to support the judgment in\nthe prevailing party’s favor. 1546 As discussed above, postjudgment attacks on the reliability of expert\ntestimony pose a particularly potent threat because the evidence in the case is closed and the party\nproffering the evidence has no opportunity to supplement the record with additional materials or\nexplanation. 1547 As a practical matter, the connective reliability requirement may be an especially\npowerful tool on appeal because it is founded in logic, rather than scientific expertise, and thus may\nbe ″more readily [*259] understood and applied″ than the Daubert factors. 1548 ″The nature of the\nstudies in each case, the plausibility of the extrapolations from them, and the known soundness of the\n\n\n\n1545\n       See, e.g., Elizondo v.

Daubert provides that ″any step that renders the analysis unreliable\n… renders the expert’s testimony inadmissible. This is true whether the step completely changes a\nreliable methodology or merely misapplies that methodology.″ 1552\n\nThis is also true when the expert cannot connect foundational data to the expert’s conclusions. Thus,\nthere are two [*260] principal types of ″gaps″ that can undermine the reliability of an expert’s opinion:\n(1) a gap between the underlying data, facts, or assumptions and the opinion; and (2) a gap between\nthe expert’s methodology and the opinion. 1553 Texas courts have found fatal analytical gaps both\nbetween the predicative data and the conclusion 1554 and between the methodology and the conclusion.\n1555\n     When the expert’s reasoning from premise to conclusion includes a leap of faith, the leap, if big\nenough, necessitates exclusion of the opinion as an improper extrapolation regardless of whether the\npremise is a methodology, technique, or data relied on by the expert. 1556 And even if the opinion is\nadmitted without objection, the opinion may be deemed conclusory and therefore ″no evidence.″ 1557\n\n1549\n       David H.

The court of appeals stated that an evaluation of the merits\nof this complaint would require it to evaluate the expert’s\nunderlying methodology, technique, or foundational data.

The Court\nobserved that the hypothetical well had characteristics of a lower performing well than the two wells\nused for comparison, and some of the [*269] characteristics of the hypothetical well - such as its\nporosity and permeability - were unknown. 1603 Although it was ″possible that the hypothetical well\nwould have produced as much as [the expert] projected,″ the Court’s task ″is not to determine whether\n[the expert’s] opinion regarding the hypothetical well’s productivity is correct.″ 1604 The Court\nacknowledged that the expert offered possible explanations for his conclusions; nevertheless, he did\nnot ″testify with any specificity how these factors affected his calculations.″ 1605 The expert ″failed to\nsufficiently explain″ why the differences between his predicted well and the comparison wells ″would\nnot result in different production rates.″ 1606 Quoting Gammill, the Court stated that ″the gap in [the\nexpert’s] analysis was his ″failure to show how his observations … supported his conclusions.’″ 1607\nThe expert’s opinion therefore was ″incompetent″ and no evidence. 1608\n\nJustice Hecht concurred, noting an analytical gap between the factual premises - the geology of the\narea, the characteristics of the wells used for comparison, and other factors affecting a well’s\nproduction - and the expert’s conclusions. 1609 But he added one other reason for rejecting the\ntestimony: the expert’s methodology did not comply with industry standards for determining where to\ndrill. ″Reliability does not mean one thing outside the courtroom and something less inside. If the\nindustry would rely on expert analysis like [the expert’s] to determine where to drill, then it was\nreliable for purposes of the trial.

The Court reasoned that if the opinion is\nunreliable, the exhibits were also unreliable and no evidence. 1611 The failure to object did not waive\nerror because the defendant’s challenge was a no-evidence challenge, rather than a challenge to\nadmissibility. 1612 The Court did not address why this no-evidence holding did not eliminate the need\nto address whether the expert challenge was timely; if the opinion was conclusory due to an analytic\ngap, there was no need to make an objection to either the testimony or the exhibit. As discussed above,\nsuch a holding would have been arguably consistent with the Court’s subsequent holdings on error\npreservation, particularly Pollock. 1613\n\nThe key point in Helton, at least for error preservation purposes, was its holding that the expert’s\ntestimony was incompetent because of an analytical gap. This holding was important because of two\nother well-established preservation rules: (1) incompetent evidence does not support a judgment ″even\nif admitted without objection″; 1614 and (2) conclusory testimony ″cannot support a judgment even\nwhen no objection was made to the statements at trial.″ 1615 The Court in Helton treated the expert’s\nopinion as conclusory.\n\nIn the same year that the Court decided Helton, the Court held in Ramirez, that an expert’s opinion was\nconclusory despite the expert’s incantation of scientific principles, physical evidence, and testing. 1616\nThe driver of a Passat was killed when the vehicle went across the grassy median and crashed into an\noncoming vehicle. 1617 It was undisputed that the left rear wheel separated from the vehicle; the dispute\nwas whether the crash caused the separation or the separation caused the crash. The defendant did not\nobject to the expert’s methodology used to conclude that the rear wheel of the plaintiff’s car came loose\nfrom the axle causing the accident. 1618 The Court therefore was limited [*271] to reviewing the face\nof the record. 1619 But that limited review demonstrated that even if the methodology was reliable, ″the\nfacts on which he relied did not support his conclusion.″ 1620\n\n1611\n       Id. at 252 (majority opinion).\n1612\n       Id.\n1613\n       See supra notes 322-26 and accompanying text.\n1614\n       City of Keller v.

While juries are important to our legal system, they cannot credit as some\nevidence expert opinions that are not reliable or are conclusory on their face. These principles are\nconsistent with a legal-sufficiency review.″ 1627\n\n [*272] Justice Hecht’s concurrence detailed other gaps in the metallurgist’s analysis. While the\nmetallurgist performed a microscopic examination of the wheel bearing, he did not ″connect [his]\nobservations with his conclusions″ except through his ″so-say.″ 1628 He did not present any ″objective\ntests that actually associate microscopic conditions with producing causes, or by statistical correlations\nbetween such conditions and bearing failures, or by analyses in the professional literature of the\n\n1621\n       Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 910-11.\n1622\n       Id. at 911.\n1623\n       Id. at 905-06, 911.\n1624\n       Id. at 911.\n1625\n       Id.\n1626\n       The Court stated that the bulk of the testimony relied upon by the dissent concerned his opinion on the existence of a defect, not\ncausation. Id. at 911-12.\n1627\n       Id. The Court also held that an accident reconstructionist’s testimony that the vehicle’s left rear wheel detached from the stub axle\nat the time of the collision but stayed ″tucked underneath″ the left rear wheel well as the car went across the grassy median was\ninadmissible. Id. at 904, 906. The expert relied on the ″laws of physics″ as the basis for his ″floating wheel″ theory and provided a very\nshort explanation. Id. at 904. But that explanation was insufficient. Id. at 906. He also relied on ″generally accepted″ accident\nreconstruction principles, but again these principles were general and he did not show how they led to his conclusion. See id. at 905-06.\nHe did perform tests but those tests concerned how the bearing failed and not when it failed. Id. Looking to the Daubert factors, the Court\nobserved that he did not rely on any supporting tests, studies, or calculations and therefore failed to show any connection between his\ndata and opinion. Id. at 904-06. His opinion was ″based solely upon his subjective interpretation of the facts.″ Id. at 906. Thus, the\nRamirez Court treats the Daubert factors as part of its analysis of whether an analytical gap exists; the expert could have tried to fill the\ngap between the data of the accident and the opinion with tests or literature but he failed to do so.\nIn Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Rather than indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the jury’s finding, the Court\nadopts a contrary approach, tipping the scale in the opposite direction to dismiss as ″conclusory″ expert\ntestimony that supports the verdict. 1632\n\nHe observed that the expert’s methodology was unchallenged and that the expert’s conclusions were\n″in a technical area in which judges have no particular expertise″ and therefore should be reviewed\nunder factual sufficiency, not legal sufficiency. 1633\n\nLess than two years after Ramirez, in Cooper Tire, a 2006 manufacturing defect case, the Court utilized\nthe Daubert factors in holding that a former tire technician’s opinion was speculative [*273] and an\nengineer’s opinion was conclusory and therefore the opinions were no evidence to support the jury\nverdict. 1634 The former tire technician’s opinion that a tire separated because of wax contamination\nduring the manufacturing process was unsupported by any scientific testing, peer-reviewed studies, or\nany support in the scientific community. 1635 It was nothing more than ″subjective belief or\nunsupported speculation″ - essentially a ″naked hypothesis untested and unconfirmed by the methods\nof science,″ and was legally insufficient to establish a manufacturing defect that caused the failure. 1636\nThe bulk of the testimony by the second expert, an engineer, addressed other issues, but he also\ntestified, over one and one-half pages of transcript, that the tire contained a manufacturing defect based\non his microscopic examination and x-rays of the tire. 1637 The Court stated that he offered the opinion\nin a ″conclusory fashion.″ 1638 His opinion was not supported by the Daubert factors; it was subjective\nand unsupported by any testing or peer-reviewed literature. 1639 There was no proof that his\nobservational technique - his methodology - was generally accepted or used in non-judicial contexts.\n1629\n       Id. at 912-13.\n1630\n       Id. at 913.\n1631\n       Id. at 915-17 (Jefferson, C.J., dissenting).\n1632\n       Id. at 917 (footnote omitted).\n1633\n      Id. at 917 n.3.

In Burrow the affidavit was submitted in support of the defendant law firm’s\ntraditional summary judgment motion. 1659 The attorney-affiant in Elizondo represented more than 500\nof the over 4000 claimants in litigation arising from the explosion and served as the court-appointed\nplaintiffs’ liaison counsel with the defendant on discovery issues. 1660 The attorney, based on this\nexperience, identified ten criteria used by the plant owner to determine a claimant’s settlement value.\n1661\n     He opined that the case had a settlement value of forty to sixty times the settlement amount\nobtained by the lawyer-defendant based on four criteria: (1) the injured worker’s injuries and work\nhistory; (2) the lawyer’s experience in the litigation arising out of this explosion; (3) his knowledge of\ngeneral settlement values; and (4) the settlement criteria used by the plant owner. 1662 The expert did\nnot state, however, how he applied these factors to determine the settlement value.\n\nAs discussed above, the Court approved the attorney’s reliance on the defendant’s other settlements\nwith similarly situated plaintiffs as a predicate for his opinion about the value of the plaintiffs’ claims.\n1663\n      The Court also approved of the general methodology, observing that an expert may reach an\nopinion on malpractice damages ″by persuasively comparing all the circumstances of the case to the\nsettlements obtained in other cases with similar circumstances arising from the event.″ 1664 But the\nattorney affidavit fell short at the connective reliability gate because the attorney merely stated that he\nconsidered these factors and that based on them the Court should ″take his word that the settlement was\ninadequate.″ 1665 The expert did not provide a ″reasoned basis″ for concluding the settlements were\ninadequate nor did he ″explain why″ the settlements were unreasonable. 1666 Specifically, even though\nthe expert explained how strong or weak the plaintiffs’ [*277] claims were on each of the factors\nconsidered by the defendant in determining settlement amounts, because the expert did not disclose the\namount of any of the other settlements, there was no means by which to compare the settlement amount\nof similarly situated plaintiffs to the settlement amount at issue. 1667 The expert ″failed to link″ the\nsettlement amount to the factors of the case. 1668 Thus, ″[a] fatal analytical gap divided the recitation\nof the facts … and the declaration of its settlement value″ and the expert’s opinions were conclusory.\n1669\n\n\n1658\n       Burrow v.

Mel\nAcres Ranch, the Court held that ″material shortcomings″ in the data relied on by the expert, the\nexpert’s reasoning, and the failure to account for differences between the underlying data and the facts\nof the case made the expert’s opinions ″conclusory″ and ″incompetent.″ 1670\n\n2. Unsuccessful Challenges in the Texas Supreme Court. The Court rejected an analytical gap\nchallenge to expert testimony on the cause of a crop failure in Helena Chemical. 1671 Some farmers\nclaimed a grain seller misrepresented a particular grain’s production in dry land. 1672 The expert, a\nplant scientist, 1673 testified, based on a physical inspection of the crop, weather and weed control\nreports, the seller’s marketing literature, and plant samples from adjacent fields used for comparison\npurposes, that the seed did not produce well in dry land. 1674 The expert admitted, however, that the\ntest results ″should be taken with a grain of salt.″ 1675 The Court stressed the expert’s substantial\nexperience and noted that he ″explained″ the results of several crop trials and ″why … and … how they\nsupported his opinions.″ 1676 Thus, his ″experience, coupled with his thorough testimony about the\nmethodology he employed,″ were sufficient to demonstrate the connection between his opinion and the\nunderlying data. 1677\n\n [*278]    An analytical gap did not exist in Ford Motor Co. v. Ledesma, a claim involving a\nmanufacturing defect in the u-bolts holding a truck’s rear axle to its rear springs. 1678 The critical\nfactual dispute was whether the truck’s axle dislodged and caused the accident or whether the axle\ndislodged as a result of the accident. 1679 Ledesma’s expert, a mechanical engineer, opined that the\nmanufacturer did not sufficiently tighten the u-bolts fastening the drive shaft to the truck. 1680 The\nexpert relied on his measurements of various truck components and on various Ford specifications. 1681\nHis inspection revealed that the u-bolts were under-torqued, but the torques might have changed due\nto the accident. 1682 He explained a number of reasons that the u-bolt could have become under-torqued\nduring manufacturing, and identified a number of his observations of the components that ″were\nconsistent with his theory of a u-bolt that was loose before the accident.″ 1683 Because the expert\n1670\n       Hous.

In summary, the expert’s\n″observations, measurements, and calculations were … tied to the physical evidence in the case which\nlikewise provided support for his conclusions and theory.″ 1689\n\n[*279] In Crump, the Texas Supreme Court approved the use of a differential diagnosis methodology\nand found no gap between that methodology and the expert’s medical opinion. 1690 After rejecting\nCrump’s contention that courts should use a ″less strict″ application of the Daubert factors to assess\nthe reliability of the expert’s opinion because differential diagnosis is an established medical\ntechnique, 1691 the Court analyzed first whether the expert’s methodology was sound under the Daubert\nfactors and then whether it passed Gammill’s analytical gap test. 1692 The Court determined that there\nwas not an impermissible analytical gap: ″As explained above in addressing the [Daubert] factors, an\nanalytical gap between the data and opinion is not shown here because″ the expert had shown how his\nobservation supported his conclusions. 1693 The Court stated that any remaining gaps ″between the data\nand the conclusion drawn from it go to the weight of [the expert’s] testimony - not its reliability.″ 1694\nCrump reaffirms that not all analytical gaps must be filled.

Finally, some gaps may be so small that they do not\nneed to be filled.\n\n3. Texas Courts of Appeals’ Cases Examining Alleged Analytical Gaps. Texas courts of appeals have\nfrequently concluded that expert testimony failed the connective reliability test either by affirming trial\ncourt rulings excluding expert testimony or by reversing a contrary trial court ruling, 1699 but they have\nalso frequently denied reliability challenges both by agreeing and disagreeing with the trial court. 1700\n1696\n       Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 819.\n1697\n       TXI Transp.

The court rejected this contention, noting the deputy’s testimony that the differences between\nthe Camaro and the Mustang had no effect on the coefficient of friction value. 1705 For example, while\nthe Mustang had a manual transmission and the Camaro had an automatic transmission, those\ndifferences did not alter the coefficient of friction value. 1706 Similarly, the expert explained that the\nweight difference between the vehicles ″did not matter″ in determining the coefficient of friction. 1707\nThe [*282] deputy ″explained why″ - a key ingredient for connective reliability 1708 - the\ndissimilarities between the Camaro and the Mustang did not affect the coefficient of friction value. 1709\nLooking to the law on admissibility of experiments, the court stated that when dissimilarities between\nan accident and a reconstructed experiment are minor and either can be made clear by explanation or\ndo not affect the test result, a trial court is within its discretion to admit experiment data. 1710\n\nNext, the plaintiff contended that the deputy’s underlying data and methodology were unreliable\nbecause he did not use a Durometer to measure and compare the consistency of the tires between the\ntoo great an analytical gap between the doctor’s expert opinions and the basis for which they were founded - the expert’s experience -\nand rejecting contention that Havner requires epidemiological evidence in medical malpractice claim); In re D.S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1754252\"><a href=\"/opinion/1754252/in-re-ds/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528-30\n(Tex.

The deputy admitted that a Durometer would have\nmeasured the hardness of the tires’ rubber, but he did not have one at the time of his accident\nreconstruction. 1712 He determined the hardness of the tire rubber between the Mustang and the\nCamaro by eyeballing the tires. 1713 By observing the tires on both vehicles, he could tell that the tires\nwere of a soft consistency. 1714 He testified that he had previously conducted testing with similar tires,\nboth on Mustangs and Camaros, and they would yield similar results. 1715 Based on his experience in\nconducting hundreds of tests with vehicles with soft rubber tires, regular passenger cars, and harder\ntruck tires, he concluded that the test results between the two types of vehicles were consistent. 1716\nHe chose the Camaro as a testing vehicle because it had soft rubber tires consistent with the wide, slick,\nsoft rubber tires that were on the Mustang. 1717 Consequently, while he did not use a Durometer, the\ndeputy’s experience in testing the coefficient of friction with similar tires was sufficient to provide a\nreliable basis for his conclusion. 1718 The court concluded the trial court did not err in finding that the\n [*283] expert’s testimony regarding the coefficient of friction and causation was reliable. 1719\n\nIn addition to demonstrating the importance of ″explaining how and why″ an expert extrapolates from\ndata to a conclusion, Lincoln teaches a second lesson: a gap may, in an appropriate case, be filled with\nexperience. The gap between the test results on the Camaro tire and the expert’s conclusions about the\nMustang was bridged by the expert’s experience testing tires. In Lincoln, the experience-gap-filler was\nextensive in a wide range of comparable settings. Thus, although the methodology of ″eyeballing″ the\ntires may not be appropriate to fill the gaps in some settings - such as a manufacturing defect claim\nagainst a tire manufacturer 1720 - it may be appropriate in other settings.\n\nTaber v.

The specific legal task this court is called upon to perform … must be\naccomplished in the context of specific testimony. This context encompasses not only the disputed\nexpert testimony itself, but also [the plaintiff’s] competing expert testimony and the testimony of fact\nwitnesses. 1726\n\nAlthough the defense experts ″acknowledged that no medical literature attributes permanent avulsion\ninjuries like the one [in question] to the natural forces of labor,″ both parties’ experts relied on a degree\nof interpretation ″in applying the existing literature to opine about causation based upon specific\ncircumstances″ in question. 1727 The court concluded that the twenty-two publications relied upon by\nthe defense were sufficient to bridge the gap between the theory and the infant’s specific avulsion\ninjury even though the causation issue ″unavoidably involves an element of speculation.″ 1728 Finally,\nthe court held that although the natural-forces-of-labor theory is a hypothesis, that label ″is not\ndispositive because this characterization by itself does not answer the reliability question. If the\n″hypothesis’ is supported by reliable data and methodology, and proffered in conformity with existing\nstandards governing admission of expert testimony, then it is admissible.″ 1729\n\nIn contrast, an expert’s attempt to link data to his conclusions failed because of a lack of transparency\nin Abraham v.

The court focused on the plaintiffs’ exposure levels at the\nplant because proof of the exposure level ″is essential to any reliable expert opinion that the particular\nsubstance caused a disease.″ 1734 The plaintiffs’ expert relied upon an EPA creosote study on exposure\nover an eight-hour day to provide descriptions of job categories of workers applying creosote in\ndifferent parts of a plant and corresponding creosote exposure levels. 1735 He testified that he\nextrapolated from the EPA data to form his opinion on the workers’ creosote exposures by examining\nthe workers’ depositions and concluding that their exposures were ″similar″ to those in the study. 1736\nHe did not include any specifics regarding his extrapolation methods nor did he take any notes\nregarding his extrapolations. 1737\nThe expert did prepare a chart rating each plaintiff’s purported exposure as high, medium, or low, but\nfailed to include any job category information for the workers even though the EPA study observed that\ndifferent job categories had different exposures. 1738 Instead, he correlated each plaintiff’s alleged\ncreosote exposure to the length of employment at the plant. 1739 Because a plaintiff must prove his\nexposure level using scientifically valid methods, the lack of evidence as to job categories meant the\ncourt could not determine whether any plaintiff had creosote exposure levels comparable to those in\nthe EPA study. 1740\nThe court held that ″scientific knowledge of the harmful level of exposure to a chemical plus\nknowledge that the plaintiffs were exposed to such quantities are minimal facts necessary to sustain the\nplaintiffs’ burden in a toxic tort case.″ 1741 Although production of a mathematically precise table\nequating levels of harm with levels of exposure was not necessary, production of evidence from which\na reasonable person could conclude that the exposure probably caused the injuries was necessary. 1742\nPlaintiffs’ lack of evidence of creosote exposures at levels equal to or greater than the exposures in the\nEPA study proved fatal to their case.

L. Rev. 1, *286\n\n4. Experience-Based Expert Testimony. The reliability of experience as a basis for an expert opinion\ncan be difficult to evaluate. One problem is that experience can be the foundation for an opinion, a\ngap-filler, or both. It is the predicative foundation for an opinion when it is the basis for the opinion.\nFor example, in a medical malpractice case, the expert may not rely on any textbooks or written\nstandards or guidelines to determine the standard of care; she might rely solely on her own experience.\nAnd in an area of medicine in which there are no written standards, experience may be the only\npotential basis from which to determine the standard of care. The same is true in a legal malpractice\ncase.\n                                                                                                                    1744\nBut that does not mean that the opinion is shielded from a reliability examination.\n\nIf courts merely accept ″experience″ as a substitute for proof that an expert’s opinions are reliable and\nthen only examine the testimony for analytical gaps in the expert’s logic and opinions, an expert can\neffectively insulate his or her conclusions from meaningful review by filling gaps in the testimony with\nalmost any type of data or subjective opinions. 1745\n\nThus, for an expert opinion based solely on the expert’s experience, courts at a minimum must examine\nwhether ″there is a sufficient connection between the existing data and the opinion offered or if there\nis ″simply too great an analytical gap’ for the expert testimony to be considered reliable.″ 1746\n\nAdditionally, as discussed in the section on predicate reliability, the experience must be substantial\nenough to warrant the conclusion that the expert can provide reliable testimony. Minimal relevant\nexperience - or a claim to experience that the expert cannot provide a meaningful description of - may\nbe insufficient. 1747\n\n [*287] The reason that the reliability of an opinion based on experience is not solely a predicative\nreliability question is that the expert often must make inferences or interpretations from that data. The\nAdvisory Committee’s notes give the following example of expert testimony based primarily on the\nexpert’s experience in the field:\n\nWhen a law enforcement agent testifies regarding the use of code words in a drug transaction, the\nprinciple used by the agent is that participants in such transactions regularly use code words to conceal\nthe nature of their activities. The method used by the agent is the application of extensive experience\n1744\n      Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v.

To the extent the law enforcement agent relies purely on his own personal observation of,\nand participation in, similar transactions, like the beekeeper in Gammill, the agent’s predicate data is\nsufficiently reliable if the agent has observed the terms at issue used in ″enough [conversations] in\nvarious circumstances to show a pattern″ of usage. 1749 To the extent the agent also relies on literature\nand materials provided to him in training, the Daubert factors may come into play. 1750\n\nEven when the predicate data is extensive experience, courts must analyze connective reliability.\nProfessor Risinger explains, ″Substantial experience of relevant similarity to what is at issue [*288]\nin the case at hand is a necessary condition for the reliability of experience-based expertise, but in most\ncontexts it is not a sufficient condition to establish reliability.″ 1751 When an expert testifies not only\nto a summary of that experience, but also about inferences based on those experiences, the expert’s\nopinion ″is based in part on experience, but in part on some translation scheme to mediate between\nprevious experiences and a particular conclusion in this case. In those circumstances, reliability is\ndependent on both sufficient experience and a reliable translation system.″ 1752 This ″translation\nsystem″ may involve the application of some kind of scientific or technical method, subject to\nmethodological reliability, or it may involve logical reasoning, subject to connective reliability, or it\nmay involve both.\n\nExperience can also be a gap-filler. Experience may be the link used to reach a conclusion when the\npredicate data is insufficient. Sometimes experience is necessary to fill gaps. For example, an appraisal\nmay require some judgment calls about the selection of the appropriate data or the interpretation of the\ndata. 1753 Lincoln v. Clark Freight Lines, Inc., 1754 is another example. In that case, the expert used data\n\n1748\n       Fed. R.

The reliability of that data was undisputed.\n1770\n     The expert then used his experience to explain why several tests he performed were significant and\nhow they supported his opinions. 1771 In other words, he used his experience to extrapolate from the\ndata to reach his conclusion.\n\nIV. Conclusion & Practice Tips\n\nWe have attempted in Part III of this Article to demonstrate that the three reliability gates - predicative\nreliability, methodological reliability, and connective reliability - are inextricably intertwined,\noverlapping, and synergetic, but they are nevertheless distinct requirements that expert evidence must\nindependently satisfy to meet the standards for admissible and competent evidence. Each gate is\nnecessary, and no two gates are, alone, sufficient.\n\nIn Part III.A, we explored the availability of postverdict legal-sufficiency challenges to expert evidence\nand the rules and standards that govern such challenges on appeal. Particularly, we focused on when\na party may raise a legal-sufficiency challenge based on the unreliability of expert evidence, even\nthough the party did not raise that complaint before the evidence was admitted at trial. Part III.B\ndiscussed two kinds of predicative reliability - one that must be challenged preverdict to be preserved\nfor review on appeal (predicative soundness) and one that can be challenged for the first time after the\nverdict (predicative probativeness). In Part III.C, we examined methodological reliability and observed\nthat it typically cannot be the basis for a legal-sufficiency challenge if it was not first made the basis\nfor a timely challenge to admissibility in the trial court. But in Part III.D, we studied connective\nreliability, which can almost always be raised for the first time postverdict, and discovered that,\nperhaps because connective reliability links (and to some degree integrates) predicative and\nmethodological reliability, the Daubert factors that measure methodological reliability are sometimes\na component of a legal-sufficiency challenge. In short, we have demonstrated that a litigator must\n [*291] endeavor to understand the three reliability gates and the distinctions between them to ensure\nthat each is satisfied, to determine how and when to preserve objections based on each, and to\nanticipate and protect against postverdict attacks on the reliability of expert testimony. Yet we have also\ndemonstrated that these concepts are quite difficult to understand, for courts as well as practitioners.\nWe offer the following ″lessons″ and ″tips″ in an effort to alleviate some of this burden.\n\nThe key lessons that parties offering and opposing expert testimony should take away from this Article\nare (1) in Texas, expert opinions are subject to both admissibility and legal-sufficiency challenges\nbased on reliability; 1772 (2) causation opinions are subject to particularly exacting scrutiny; 1773 (3) it\nis the basis of an expert’s opinion, not his qualifications to offer an opinion, that gives the opinion\n1769\n       Helena Chem.

Rev. 1, *291\n\nprobative value; 1774 (4) an expert must identify the basis or predicate for his opinion, and if the expert\nfails to do so, or if the predicate identified is not reliable or does not support the expert’s opinion, the\nexpert’s opinion is likewise not reliable; 1775 (5) reliability is not correctness - an opinion that is the\nproduct of an unreliable methodology is not reliable even if it happens to be correct, and conflicting\nopinions that result from different but reliable methodologies may both be reliable even if one is\nnecessarily incorrect; 1776 and (6) when an expert opinion is founded in part on reasoning and analysis,\na meaningful ″analytical gap″ in the expert’s logic renders the opinion unreliable. 1777\n\nConnective reliability is perhaps the most important reliability gate because it links - and to a degree,\nsubsumes - both predicative and methodological reliability. It requires experts to explain their\nreasoning and thus show how they bridge [*292] any gap between the predicative data or methodology\nthey rely on and their conclusions. In short, experts must be transparent and show their work, much\nlike high school math teachers require for problem solving on tests. Thus, to ensure that their\nconclusions are not deemed conclusory and pass the connective reliability gate, experts should (1)\nmake plain the information they considered and why that information was appropriate to consider; (2)\nexplain how they used the information; and (3) explain why their use of information leads to their\nconclusion. This explanatory process must be used for each of the experts’ opinions. By doing so, a\nparty can avoid the following five traps.\n\nFirst, unreliable expert testimony may prove fatal to a claim or affirmative defense even when a party\nprevails with the factfinder. An appellate court may consider a properly preserved preverdict objection\nto the reliability of expert testimony as part of a challenge to the trial court’s decision to admit that\nevidence, and an appellate court may consider a challenge to reliability that was raised for the first time\npostverdict as a legal-sufficiency challenge. When expert testimony is necessary to prove a claim or\naffirmative defense 1778 and the expert testimony is unreliable, there will be no evidence to support the\nverdict. Thus, a party must consider not only whether the expert’s testimony will pass the reliability\ngate at trial, but also on appeal.\n\nSecond, a preverdict objection is properly preserved if it challenges all three parts of the reliability\ninquiry. If the preverdict objection does not challenge the methodology of the opinion, that challenge\nmay not be raised as part of a legal-sufficiency challenge to the evidence that is based on\nmethodological flaws by the expert unless (1) the methodological flaws are apparent from the record;\n1773\n       Specifically, expert testimony on the ″causation″ element of a claim is subject to a particular set of rules and standards. Under\nRobinson, an expert causation opinion is not reliable, and therefore not admissible, if the expert fails to rule out other plausible causes;\nunder Merrell, an expert causation opinion is conclusory, and therefore not probative evidence, if the expert fails to rule out other\nplausible causes.

Coastal Transport states such challenges are waived unless the\nflaw is apparent from the face of the record. 1780 But other cases [*293] suggest they are not. 1781 The\nCoastal Transport Court’s reference to ″underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data″\ncould be a reference to the methodology, techniques, or foundation used in studies or data collections\nrelied upon by an expert rather than the expert’s own methodology.\n\nRamirez, Pollock, Whirlpool, and Merrell indicate that methodological and foundational challenges\nthat are determinable on the face of the record may be raised for the first time postverdict as\n″conclusory″ or ″speculative.″ For example, the Court in Ramirez discussed a Daubert factor - the\nabsence of testing - in support of its holding that the testimony was conclusory. 1782 Likewise, the\nCourt in Whirlpool relied on the absence of testing and evidence satisfying some of the other Daubert\nfactors in holding that an expert’s opinion was conclusory. And a number of courts have found that\nwhen an expert relies on literature or other foundational data and that literature or data is not in the\nrecord, the opinion is unreliable. 1783 It is but a short step when the supporting data are missing from\nthe record to conclude that not only is the opinion [*294] unreliable but that it is conclusory because\nthe factfinder and appellate court are only provided with the ipse dixit of the expert. Thus, careful\nwitness preparation and presentation should also proceed as if not only have analytical gap and\nconclusory objections been made, but also methodological and predicate reliability objections.\n\n1779\n       See supra notes 264-69 and accompanying text (discussing Coastal Transport).\n1780\n        Coastal Transp.

And to do so is not far from agreeing with the appellant’s original\nsuggestion in Maritime Overseas - which the Court rejected - that the standards ″articulated in\nRobinson and Havner are the proper standards for reviewing the [legal] sufficiency″ of expert\ntestimony. 1785 It is also worth noting that the only Justice left from the Maritime Overseas Court is\nthen-Justice Hecht, who dissented on this issue.\n\nThird, a party may raise a conclusory objection for the first time postverdict as part of a\nlegal-sufficiency challenge. 1786 In determining the amount of detail to present to a jury about the basis\nfor an expert’s opinion, a party has to balance the benefits of a fulsome explanation that will protect\nit in the event of a posttrial motion or appeal against the risk of alienating the jury by presenting too\nmuch detail. If the party loses the jury, all the legal niceties about protecting the record become\nacademic. But [*295] the lesson from Texas appellate decisions is that a party who proceeds with\nminimal detail in the absence of an objection does so at its peril. In short, when making this balance,\na party must therefore proceed as if the other party has made an objection that the evidence is\nconclusory, speculative and unreliable because the expert fails to provide a predicate for her opinion,\nbecause the expert provides a predicate for his opinion but the predicate provided does not actually\nsupport the opinion, or because the process by which the expert reasoned from his predicate to her\nopinion about the facts of the case leaves too great an analytical gap. And a preverdict objection to the\nlack of a supportive predicate or to the existence of an analytical gap is not necessary to preserve error\nfor a legal-sufficiency challenge based on these defects. The burden, therefore, falls on the proponent\nof the expert opinion to identify the potential gaps as part of witness preparation by carefully\nexamining the underlying methodology and predicate data and the links necessary to reach the expert’s\nconclusion and then plugging those gaps during the expert’s testimony.\n\nCareful witness preparation will identify some opinions as conclusory with little effort. For example,\nan expert’s use of words and phrases from a jury charge will not, without more, constitute evidence.\n\n1784\n        To be clear, there were two experts whose testimony was challenged in Ramirez. Volkswagen argued that both experts’ testimony\nwas unreliable and no evidence to support the jury verdict of a defect in the vehicle. For the first expert, Ronald Walker, the Court relied\non both the Daubert factors and the Gammill test to hold that his opinion was solely ″his subjective interpretation of the facts,″\n″unreliable,″ and ″no evidence.″ Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 906. For the second expert, Edward Cox, the dissent argued that the legal\nsufficiency of his testimony was not presented as an issue to the Court. Id. at 909. Volkswagen did not dispute in the Supreme Court -\nas it did in the trial court and court of appeals - that his testimony was unreliable but it did contend that it was no evidence to support\nthe defect finding. Id. at 902-03. The dissent argued that Volkswagen could not contest the reliability of Cox’s testimony in its no\nevidence challenge in the Supreme Court. ″No evidence challenges to conclusory or speculative testimony that is non-probative on its\nface″ could be raised at any time, while ″no evidence challenges to the reliability of expert testimony in which we evaluate the underlying\nmethodology, technique or foundational data used by the expert″ must be preserved.

L. Rev. 1, *295\n\n1787\n      Similarly, when an expert offers no support for an opinion, it is conclusory. 1788 But in some cases\nit is more difficult to determine if an opinion is conclusory. Arkoma Basin is the only explicit definition\nof when a statement is conclusory by the Texas Supreme Court; it narrowly defines a conclusory\nstatement as one that is essentially a ″conclusion without any explanation.″ 1789 Two courts of appeals\nhave given [*296] similar narrow definitions in other contexts. One defined it as a statement that\n″expresses subjective belief and gives no factual support for that belief.″ 1790 Another defined it as a\nstatement ″that does not provide the underlying facts to support the conclusion.″ 1791\nDespite these narrow definitions, the Texas Supreme Court treats an expert opinion as conclusory when\nan explanation is given but leaves an analytical gap. Ramirez imports the ″analytical gap″ test into the\nanalysis of whether expert testimony is conclusory and whether a trial objection is necessary. And the\nCourt went further in Pollock when it held that even when some explanation is offered for an opinion,\nif that explanation ″does not, on its face, support the opinion, the opinion is still conclusory.″ 1792\nPollock treated expert testimony as conclusory when the stated basis does not in fact support the\nopinion. Pollock may represent the high water mark for how forgiving the Court will be when an expert\nopinion has a stated basis that is part of the record - there, studies - but the stated basis does not in fact\nsupport the expert’s conclusion. And arguably Pollock could be limited to a case where a party at least\nobjects that the evidence is conclusory before the close of the evidence. While that objection is not\nnormally needed for a legal-sufficiency review of evidence, it arguably could be required because Rule\n705(a) of the Texas Rules of Evidence allows an expert to present an opinion without stating its basis\n″unless the court requires otherwise.″ 1793 Such a requirement arguably would reconcile the tension\nbetween Arkoma Basin and Pollock.\nFourth, as discussed above under the predicative-reliability gate, a preverdict objection is not necessary\nwhen an expert’s opinion is based on facts that are contrary to the undisputed evidence. 1794\nNonetheless, it is also helpful to think of this as a [*297] lack of connective reliability; the disconnect\n1787\n       See Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v.

Regardless of whether or not Deputy Ortega’s actions were in line with national\n\n“accepted policies and procedures,” which is what Weinblatt appears to be testifying about in the\n\nsubject report, this Court should not consider the report because it is not relevant as to the issue\n\nof recklessness as defined above. Moreover, in Page 5 of Weiblatt’s report, he mentions a “non-\n\nforcible felony” but Texas does not use such language to define felonies in its Penal Code,\n\nWeinblatt is applying his home State of Indiana’s legal concepts to the case at hand. More\n\nspecifically, Indiana Code Section 35-41-1-11 which defines forcible felony as a “felony that\n\ninvolves the use or threat of force against a human being, or in which there is imminent danger\n\nof bodily injury to a human being, which is a direct misapplication of law to the facts in the case\n\nat hand.

Plaintiffs\n\nhave not met their burden of showing their expert is qualified to testify as to what specific acts\n\nby a Hidalgo County Officer would constitute recklessness as defined by the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt.

This opinion presupposes [speculates]\n\nthat County Deputy Ortega was aware that a “non-forcible felony” [Texas uses “Degrees”] had\n\noccurred and that he engaged in a “pursuit” of who ever committed said non-forcible felony.\n\nPlaintiffs’ own allegations state that the officer failed to inquire about the initial traffic stop. See,\n\nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Petition.

See, Exhibit B to Plaintiffs Response to HC’s 1st & 2nd Amend. Plea to\n\nJur. Weinblatt actually goes into an analysis of Pharr PD’s Police Policies which is irrelevant as\n\nto Hidalgo County’s actions. Id. pg 6. Further, the Weinblatt states that because of the “pursuit\n\nfor a non-forcible felony” the public was at “great risk.” Id. Here the expert moves away from\n\n“accepted police standards and practices” and opines on the level of danger to the public at large,\n\nas a result of actions [not proven] taken by officers. He is unqualified to scientifically assess the\n\nrisks to the public and to attribute such risks to actions by any police officer involved.\n\nAccordingly, opinion No.2 fails to provide admissible evidence.

Id. It is not the courts job to link\n\nor infer facts, the expert needs to show every step of his analysis. Weinblatt actually states that\n\nDeputy Ortega “erroneously” chose to enter into the scenario, but does not provide foundational\n\nfacts to support said claim. Id.
