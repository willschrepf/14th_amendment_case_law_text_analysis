INTRODUCTION2\n\n      In twenty-seven issues,3 Appellant Tayton Seth Finley appeals both the\n\nfinal decree of divorce dissolving his marriage to Appellee Marguerite Breanne\n\nFinley (Lilley)4 and the final protective order entered against him. Because the\n\nrecord reveals that Lilley did not plead for a permanent injunction, we will\n\ndissolve the trial court’s permanent injunction and modify the final decree to omit\n\nany reference to the permanent injunction. We will affirm the granting of the\n\n\n\n      2\n       This case was originally submitted without oral argument on September\n28, 2011, before a panel consisting of Justice Dauphinot, Justice Gardner, and\nJustice McCoy. After submission, the court was notified that a petition for\nbankruptcy had been filed, which suspended the appeal, and on January 11,\n2012, the court issued an order staying the case. The bankruptcy case was\nclosed on November 14, 2013; was reopened on May 15, 2014; and was closed\nagain five days later on May 20, 2014. The motion to reinstate was not filed until\nNovember 18, 2014. This court granted Appellant’s motion to reinstate;\nresubmitted the case without oral argument; and assigned this case to a new\npanel, consisting of Justice Dauphinot, Justice Walker, and Justice Meier. We\nare concerned that the delay between the December 29, 2010 divorce decree\nand our disposition of this appeal over four years later has caused many of the\nissues concerning the parties’ divorce, child support, and property division to\nbecome stale.\n      3\n        Appellant’s brief lists issues one through thirty, but the issues are not\nconsecutively numbered, omitting numbers fifteen through seventeen. After\nsetting forth his twenty-seven issues, Finley abandons his numbered issues and\ninstead raises arguments related to the following: (1) the protective order, (2) the\nchild support, (3) the attorney’s fees, (4) the permanent injunction, (5) the\nproperty division, and (6) the motion for new trial. We therefore address these six\nissues.\n      4\n        At the conclusion of the divorce trial, the trial court granted Marguerite’s\nrequest that her last name be changed back to her maiden name of Lilley, which\nis the name by which we refer to her in this opinion.\n\n\n                                         2\n\fdivorce and the remainder of the final decree as modified, and we will affirm the\n\nfinal protective order.\n\n                                  II. BACKGROUND\n\n      Finley and Lilley married in 2005 and had a son in 2008. In late December\n\n2009, Finley committed family violence when he broke into his mother’s home by\n\nthrowing a brick through the glass French doors, tried to take his son from Lilley,\n\nand punched Lilley in the face. The following month, Lilley filed a petition for\n\ndivorce and an application for a protective order, both of which Finley answered.\n\nThe trial court specially set the final trial for November 30, 2010.\n\n      On November 11, 2010, Finley’s attorney filed a motion for withdrawal of\n\ncounsel, citing her inability to effectively communicate with Finley. The trial court\n\ngranted the motion to withdraw on November 17, 2010; noted that Finley had\n\nbeen informed that the final trial was set for November 30, 2010; and gave\n\nFinley’s attorney fifteen days to provide Finley with all documents relating to his\n\ncase. Also on November 17, Finley filed an unverified motion for continuance\n\nwithout attaching an affidavit, and the motion was impliedly overruled.\n\n      Finley did not appear for trial on November 30, 2010.            After hearing\n\ntestimony from Lilley, the trial court granted the divorce and awarded Lilley\n\ncurrent child support of $479 per month; retroactive child support of $5,269; the\n\n2009 tax refund; the marital residence; sole managing conservatorship; a\n\nprotective order; a permanent injunction; and her attorney’s fees. The trial court\n\nawarded Finley his personal property and gave him until December 15, 2010, to\n\n\n                                          3\n\fremove his personal property from the marital residence. Finley filed a motion for\n\nnew trial and requested findings of fact and conclusions of law.            He then\n\nperfected this appeal.\n\n                              III. PROTECTIVE ORDER\n\n      In his first issue, Finley argues that the final protective order was entered in\n\nerror. Finley contends that he received inadequate notice that Lilley’s application\n\nfor a protective order would be heard at the final trial, which denied him due\n\nprocess; that he should have been appointed an attorney for the protective order\n\nhearing; and that the evidence is insufficient to support the protective order.\n\n                                   A. Mootness\n\n      Because the final protective order expired on November 30, 2012, our first\n\ndetermination must be whether Finley’s appeal from the final protective order is\n\nmoot. The general rule is that a case becomes moot, and thus unreviewable,\n\nwhen it appears that a party seeks to obtain relief on some alleged controversy\n\nwhen in reality none exists. Williams v. Lara, 52 S.W.3d 171, 184 (Tex. 2001). If\n\na case becomes moot, the parties lose their standing to maintain their claims. Id.\n\n      Texas law, however, recognizes a collateral consequences exception to\n\nthe mootness doctrine. FDIC v. Nueces Cnty., 886 S.W.2d 766, 767 (Tex. 1994).\n\nThe collateral consequences exception has been applied when prejudicial events\n\nhave occurred that will continue to stigmatize the person long after the judgment\n\nhas ceased to operate.      In re Cummings, 13 S.W.3d 472, 475 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 2000, no pet.).\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       Appeals of expired protective orders issued for family violence often fall\n\ninto this collateral consequences exception because although such orders may\n\nultimately expire, the social stigma attached to them generally does not.\n\nSchaban-Maurer v. Maurer-Schaban, 238 S.W.3d 815, 822–23 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2007, no pet.), overruled on other grounds by Iliff v. Illiff, 339 S.W.3d 74\n\n(Tex. 2011). Moreover, there are attendant legal consequences to being the\n\nsubject of such a protective order. Id. at 823 (citing Texas Family Code section\n\n153.004(f) and noting that the family code requires courts to consider a history of\n\ndomestic violence when determining child custody).\n\n       Under the collateral consequences exception, the expiration of the\n\nprotective order in this case does not render Finley’s appeal from the final\n\nprotective order moot. See id. We will therefore review the substance of Finley’s\n\nchallenges to the protective order.\n\n                                      B. Notice\n\n       Finley argues that he was denied due process because he received\n\ninadequate notice that Lilley’s application for a protective order would be heard at\n\nthe final trial.\n\n       A court may render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who\n\ndoes not attend a hearing if the respondent received service of the application\n\nand notice of the hearing. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 85.006 (West 2014).         Under\n\nthe presumption of regularity of judgments, we presume the recitations in the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fcourt’s judgment are correct absent any evidence to the contrary.                In re\n\nGuardianship of Winn, 372 S.W3d 291, 298 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.).\n\n      Here, the final protective order recites that “Respondent, Tayton Seth\n\nFinley, although duly and properly cited, did not appear and wholly made\n\ndefault.” The record reveals that on January 26, 2010, Finley was served with\n\nLilley’s application for a protective order and was given notice that the hearing on\n\nLilley’s application would occur on February 8, 2010. On February 8, 2010, the\n\nassociate judge’s report notes that the protective order hearing was extended\n\nuntil the reset date. On February 16, 2010, the hearing on the application for\n\nprotective order was reset to February 24, 2010. The record does not contain a\n\nrecord or a report from any February 24 hearing. The application for a protective\n\norder was not mentioned at subsequent status conferences but appears to have\n\nbeen carried until the final trial. Finley admits that he had notice of the final trial\n\nand yet did not appear.\n\n      The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals dealt with a similar situation in\n\nCummings.      13 S.W.3d at 475–76.        In Cummings, both parties filed for a\n\nprotective order and noticed hearings. Id. at 475. The initial hearing on the\n\nwife’s protective order did not occur. Id. When the husband set a hearing on his\n\nmotion for protective order for June 15, 1998, the wife asked for and received a\n\ncontinuance. Id. at 475–76. The wife then noticed July 17 as a hearing date for\n\nher application. Id. At the July 17 hearing, the husband asked the trial court to\n\nconsider his application as well, but the wife insisted that she had not received\n\n\n                                          6\n\fnotice that the husband’s application would be considered at that day’s hearing.\n\nId. at 476. The trial court indicated his desire to consider both applications in one\n\nhearing, but when the wife continued to resist, the trial court stated, “Okay. We’ll\n\nstart it and recess it then.” Id. The wife began presenting evidence in support of\n\nher application, but the trial court recessed the hearing before she had finished.\n\nId. When the case reconvened on July 22, the husband again asked to proceed\n\nwith his application, and the wife resisted, arguing that the husband had never\n\nnoticed a hearing date for his application. Id. The trial court found that the wife\n\nhad sufficient notice of the hearing on the husband’s application and proceeded\n\nwith hearing both applications. Id. On appeal, the wife argued that the trial court\n\nerred by considering the husband’s application at the July 22 hearing. Id. The\n\nCorpus Christi Court of Appeals held that even assuming the trial court did err,\n\nthe wife failed to show how she was harmed by the error. Id.\n\n      In the case before us, even assuming that the trial court did err by hearing\n\nLilley’s application for a protective order on the same date as the final trial, Finley\n\nhas failed to show how he was harmed by the error. Before reversing a trial\n\ncourt judgment, we must conclude that an error probably caused the rendition of\n\nan improper judgment or probably prevented the appellant from properly\n\npresenting the case to the court of appeals. Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a). Neither\n\nconclusion is warranted here.       Finley does not argue that he would have\n\nappeared for the final trial had he known that the trial court was also hearing\n\nLilley’s application for a protective order. Nor does he argue in his brief what\n\n\n                                          7\n\fwitnesses he would have summoned, what their testimony would have been, or\n\nwhat other evidence he would have put on that would have led the trial court to\n\nreach a different conclusion.5      We hold that Finley has not demonstrated\n\nreversible error from any alleged lack of notice regarding the hearing on Lilley’s\n\napplication for a protective order. See Cummings, 13 S.W.3d at 476.\n\n                                  C. Due Process\n\n         Finley also argues that he was denied due process with regard to the\n\nprotective order. We note that Finley did not raise this issue in his motion for\n\nnew trial. Moreover, due process requires that Finley be given the opportunity to\n\nbe heard, but he waived that right by failing to attend the hearing. See Hunt v.\n\nState, No. 03-11-00352-CV, 2012 WL 3793283, at *2 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug.\n\n31, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.). We therefore hold that Finley was not denied due\n\nprocess. See id. at *2–3 (holding that appellant’s right to due process was not\n\nviolated when he failed to attend hearing and default protective order was\n\nentered).\n\n                            D. Right to Representation\n\n         With regard to Finley’s argument that he had a right to be represented by\n\nan attorney at the hearing on Lilley’s application for a protective order, we have\n\npreviously held that there is no constitutional or statutory right to counsel in a\n\nprotective order case. See Maki v. Anderson, No. 02-12-00513-CV, 2013 WL\n\n         5\n         We hold below that the evidence is sufficient to support the protective\norder.\n\n\n                                         8\n\f4121229, at *6 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Aug. 15, 2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.),\n\ncert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 76 (2014). Because Finley fails to show why our prior\n\nprecedent was in error or how his situation is different, we are constrained by our\n\nprior precedent. See Chase Home Fin., L.L.C. v. Cal W. Reconveyance Corp.,\n\n309 S.W.3d 619, 630–31 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (stating\n\nthat absent a decision from a higher court or this court sitting en banc that is on\n\npoint and contrary to the prior panel decision or an intervening and material\n\nchange in statutory law, this court is bound by the prior holding of another panel\n\nof this court).\n\n                        E. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Finley’s first issue also appears to challenge the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the protective order, arguing that he had denied any basis\n\nfor a protective order and had specifically denied Lilley’s claims of criminal\n\nconduct.\n\n       Although there is a split among the courts of appeals, in this court we\n\nreview appellate challenges to the granting of protective orders for sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence, measured by legal and factual sufficiency contentions. Schaban-\n\nMaurer, 238 S.W.3d at 823. We may sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only\n\nwhen (1) the record discloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact;\n\n(2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the\n\nonly evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes\n\n\n                                        9\n\fconclusively the opposite of a vital fact. Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez,\n\n977 S.W.2d 328, 334 (Tex. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1040 (1999); Robert W.\n\nCalvert, “No Evidence” and “Insufficient Evidence” Points of Error, 38 Tex. L.\n\nRev. 361, 362–63 (1960).       In determining whether there is legally sufficient\n\nevidence to support the finding under review, we must consider evidence\n\nfavorable to the finding if a reasonable factfinder could and disregard evidence\n\ncontrary to the finding unless a reasonable factfinder could not. Cent. Ready Mix\n\nConcrete Co. v. Islas, 228 S.W.3d 649, 651 (Tex. 2007); City of Keller v. Wilson,\n\n168 S.W.3d 802, 807, 827 (Tex. 2005).\n\n      When reviewing an assertion that the evidence is factually insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding, we set aside the finding only if, after considering and weighing\n\nall of the evidence in the record pertinent to that finding, we determine that the\n\ncredible evidence supporting the finding is so weak, or so contrary to the\n\noverwhelming weight of all the evidence, that the answer should be set aside and\n\na new trial ordered. Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986)\n\n(op. on reh’g); Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986); Garza v. Alviar,\n\n395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex. 1965).\n\n      A trial court shall render a protective order if, after a hearing, it finds that\n\nfamily violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. Tex. Fam. Code\n\nAnn. §§ 81.001, 85.001(b) (West 2014). Family violence means an act by a\n\nmember of a family or household against another member of the family or\n\nhousehold that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or\n\n\n                                         10\n\fsexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in fear of\n\nimminent physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault, but does not\n\ninclude defensive measures to protect oneself. Id. § 71.004(1) (West 2014).\n\n       Here, the record contains Lilley’s uncontroverted testimony that during\n\ntheir separation, Finley broke into his mother’s home, where Lilley and his son\n\nwere staying, by throwing a brick through the glass French doors and tried to\n\ntake their son from Lilley. When Lilley would not allow Finley to take their son,\n\nFinley grabbed Lilley’s glasses off her face and punched her in the face, splitting\n\nher eye. We hold that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support\n\nthe trial court’s granting of Lilley’s application for a protective order.6        See\n\nSchaban-Maurer, 238 S.W.3d at 825; see also Coffman v. Melton, No. 14-13-\n\n00661-CV, 2014 WL 4377466, at *5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Sept. 4,\n\n2014, pet. denied) (“Evidence of past violence can constitute sufficient evidence\n\nthat future violence is likely.”).\n\n       Having decided against Finley on each of his arguments pertaining to the\n\nfinal protective order, we overrule Finley’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Finley also asserts within his first issue that the trial court’s granting of\nLilley’s application on November 30, 2010—ten months after it was filed—\nindicated a lack of urgency or necessity. Because we have held that the\nevidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s granting of Lilley’s application for\na protective order and because Finley’s assertion does not provide any avenue\nfor relief, we need not address his assertion. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1 (requiring\nappellate court to address every issue necessary for final disposition of appeal).\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                                IV. CHILD SUPPORT\n\n      In his second issue, Finley argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it entered the child support order.        Finley appears to challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s calculation of current child\n\nsupport and retroactive child support.\n\n                             A. Standard of Review\n\n      A trial court has discretion to set child support within the parameters\n\nprovided by the family code, and we will not disturb the trial court’s child support\n\norder unless the complaining party shows a clear abuse of discretion. Iliff, 339\n\nS.W.3d at 78; see Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 154.121–.123 (West 2014). A trial\n\ncourt abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, without\n\nreference to guiding rules or principles, or when it fails to analyze or apply the\n\nlaw correctly. Iliff, 339 S.W.3d at 78. Legal and factual sufficiency challenges\n\nare not independent grounds of error; rather, they are relevant factors in\n\nassessing whether the trial court abused its discretion.        Newberry v. Bohn-\n\nNewberry, 146 S.W.3d 233, 235 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\nWhen an appellant alleges that the trial court abused its discretion because the\n\nevidence was insufficient, this court employs a two-prong test: first, we must ask\n\nwhether the trial court had sufficient information on which to exercise its\n\ndiscretion; and second, we determine whether the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby causing the child support order to be manifestly unjust or unfair. Id. The trial\n\ncourt does not abuse its discretion when its decision is based on conflicting\n\n\n                                         12\n\fevidence or where some evidence of probative and substantive character exists\n\nto support the child support order. Id. We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the trial court’s decision and indulge every reasonable presumption\n\nin favor of the trial court’s judgment. Id.\n\n                          B. Child Support Calculations\n\n      Within his second issue, Finley argues that the trial court erred by relying\n\non Lilley’s testimony regarding his past financial aid to calculate his resources\n\ninstead of utilizing the federal minimum wage as the basis for his resources.\n\n                      1. Law on Calculating Child Support\n\n      The family code instructs the trial court to calculate net resources for the\n\npurpose of determining child support liability. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.062\n\n(West 2014). There must be some evidence of a substantive and probative\n\ncharacter of net resources in order for the trial court to discharge this duty.\n\nNewberry, 146 S.W.3d at 236.          “Resources” is defined as various types of\n\n“income actually being received.” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.062(b). In the\n\nabsence of evidence of a party’s resources, the court shall presume that the\n\nparty has wages or salary equal to the federal minimum wage for a forty-hour\n\nweek. Id. § 154.068 (West 2014). After determining a party’s resources, the trial\n\ncourt shall deduct taxes and expenses for the cost of health insurance or cash\n\nmedical support for the obligor’s child ordered by the court under section\n\n154.182; the amount ascertained after subtracting the preceding deductions from\n\nthe party’s resources equals the net resources available for child support. Id.\n\n\n                                          13\n\f§ 154.062(d). The child support obligation is then determined by applying the\n\nstatutory guidelines to the party’s net resources. Id. § 154.125 (West 2014). The\n\nfamily code sets a guideline that an obligor who has two children should pay child\n\nsupport equal to twenty percent of the first $7,500 of his monthly net resources.\n\nId.\n\n                              2. Evidence at Trial\n\n      Here, Lilley testified that Finley was previously in medical school in\n\nTennessee and that he had received between $35,000 and $40,000 in\n\ngovernment and private loans each year when he was attending medical school.\n\nLilley testified that Finley was “currently suspended” from medical school for\n\nbehavioral problems but that he hoped to be readmitted to medical school. Lilley\n\ntestified that Finley had not worked since they had separated in December 2009.\n\nLilley asked the trial court to base the child support amount “on just whatever the\n\nminimum wage job is” or on $35,000. The trial court later asked Lilley whether\n\nFinley had received any other financial help, and she responded that in addition\n\nto the government loans and private loans he had received, his family had “been\n\nsupporting him the past year.” She said that they paid for his groceries, “running\n\nmoney,” his car, and gas, and she estimated that the support totaled at least\n\n$500 per month. After hearing Lilley’s testimony, the trial court based its child\n\nsupport orders on an annual income of $35,000; ordered Finley to pay $479 per\n\nmonth in current child support; and ordered Finley to pay retroactive child support\n\nin the amount of $5,269—eleven months’ child support for the time since the\n\n\n                                        14\n\fpetition for divorce was filed in January 2010 to the trial in November 2010—to\n\nbe paid at the rate of $300 per month.\n\n                                    3. Analysis\n\n      Lilley’s testimony demonstrates that Finley had received monies from his\n\nfamily totaling at least $6,000 per year and from financial aid sources totaling\n\n$35,000 to $40,000 per year. Lilley’s testimony regarding these amounts was\n\nundisputed. Finley was not in court and did not cross-examine Lilley or present\n\nany evidence regarding his past or present income or whether his receipt of loan\n\nor aid monies changed as a result of his suspension from medical school while\n\nhe sought readmission. Because the duty to pay child support is not limited to an\n\nobligor’s ability to pay from earnings but also includes his ability to pay from any\n\nand all sources that may be available, the trial court was entitled to base its child\n\nsupport calculation on the gifts that Finley had received from his family and the\n\nproceeds of his financial aid and private loans, which constitute resources within\n\nthe meaning of section 154.062(b)(5). See In re A.M.P., 368 S.W.3d 842, 849\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.) (stating that under the plain\n\nmeaning of section 154.062, gifts are included in the calculation of net\n\nresources); In re L.R.P., 98 S.W.3d 312, 313–14 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2003, pet. dism’d) (holding that monetary gifts are “resources” within the meaning\n\nof section 154.062(b)(5)); accord L.R.P., 98 S.W.3d at 315 (stating that trial court\n\nconsidered partial scholarship to be a resource and holding that scholarship was\n\nproperly included among resources in setting child support).           Viewing the\n\n\n                                         15\n\fevidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s decision and indulging\n\nevery reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court’s judgment, we hold that\n\nthe trial court had sufficient information on which to exercise its discretion7 and\n\nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering Finley to pay monthly\n\nchild support of $279, which was not manifestly unjust or unfair. See L.R.P., 98\n\nS.W.3d at 315 (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering\n\ncollege student to pay $400 per month to support his son); see also Monroy v.\n\nMonroy, No. 03-10-00275-CV, 2011 WL 3890401, at *5–6 (Tex. App.—Aug. 31,\n\n2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby calculating child support based on ex-wife’s undisputed testimony about\n\nappellant’s former income and proceeds from real estate sales even though\n\nappellant was in jail at the time of the trial).\n\n       Finley also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering\n\npayments of retroactive child support of $300 per month. Our analysis set forth\n\nabove for the current child support payments is equally applicable here. In the\n\nabsence of any affirmative evidence that Finley’s receipt of the $6,000 per year\n\n       7\n        Because there was evidence of Finley’s resources, the trial court was not\nrequired to presume that Finley had income equal to the federal minimum wage\nfor a forty-hour week. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.068 (stating that in the\nabsence of any evidence of a party’s resources, as defined in section 154.062(b),\ntrial court shall presume that party had income equal to the federal minimum\nwage for a forty-hour week); L.R.P., 98 S.W.3d at 314 (refusing to utilize the\nfederal minimum wage presumption under section 154.068 because there was\nevidence of resources—father’s payment of appellant’s car insurance, car\nmaintenance, cell phone, medical insurance, and medical bills were treated as in-\nkind gifts, and appellant’s athletic scholarship—for calculating appellant’s child\nsupport obligation).\n\n                                            16\n\ffrom his family and of the $35,000 to $40,000 per year of financial aid ceased\n\nduring the time the divorce was pending, and viewing the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the trial court’s decision and indulging every reasonable\n\npresumption in favor of the trial court’s judgment, we hold that the trial court had\n\nsufficient information on which to exercise its discretion and that the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by ordering Finley to pay monthly retroactive child\n\nsupport of $300, which was not manifestly unjust or unfair. See Tex. Fam. Code\n\nAnn. § 154.131 (West 2014) (requiring courts to consider the obligor’s net\n\nresources during the relevant time period in ordering retroactive child support);\n\nMonroy, 2011 WL 3890401, at *6 (holding that based on the evidence before it,\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering appellant to pay retroactive\n\nchild support of $618 for seventeen of the months of separation).\n\n                               C. Required Findings\n\n      Within his second issue, Finley also argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by failing to make the required findings under section 154.130.\n\n      In rendering an order of child support, the trial court is required to make\n\nfindings if a party files a written request with the court not later than ten days after\n\nthe date of the hearing, a party makes an oral request in open court during the\n\nhearing, or the amount of child support ordered by the court varies from the\n\namount computed by applying the percentage guidelines under section 154.125.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.130(a) (West 2014). If findings are required under\n\nsection 154.130, the trial court shall state whether the application of the\n\n\n                                          17\n\fguidelines would be unjust or inappropriate and shall state the net resources of\n\nthe obligor per month, the net resources of the obligee per month, the\n\npercentage applied to the obligor’s net resources for child support, and the\n\nspecific reasons that the amount of child support per month ordered by the court\n\nvaries from the amount computed by applying the percentage guidelines under\n\nsection 154.125. Id. § 154.130(b).\n\n      Finley contends that his January 28, 2011 request for findings triggered the\n\ntrial court’s duty to make the required findings regarding net resources. See id.\n\nHowever, in order to trigger this duty, the party must request these findings no\n\nlater than ten days after the date of the hearing that resulted in the order. Id.\n\n§ 154.130(a)(1). Because the trial court held the hearing that resulted in the child\n\nsupport order on November 30, 2010, Finley’s January 28, 2011 request was\n\nuntimely.8 See id.\n\n      Even without a proper request, if the child support amount varies from the\n\namount computed by applying the percentage guidelines in the family code, the\n\n      8\n       Finley contends that his request was effective because he filed it within\nthe court’s thirty-day plenary period. However, even under rule 296, he would\nhave been required to submit his request no later than twenty days from the date\non which the trial court signed the judgment. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 296; Harmon v.\nHarmon, 879 S.W.2d 213, 216 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ\ndenied) (deciding that husband was not entitled to findings under the family code\nor under rule 296 when he requested them more than twenty days after the trial\ncourt signed the default judgment), abrogated on other grounds by Ratisseau v.\nRatisseau, 44 S.W.3d 695 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. dism’d).\nThe judgment here was signed on December 29, 2010, making any request for\nfindings due by January 19, 2011, in order to comply with rule 296. Therefore,\neven under this theory, Finley’s request would have been untimely.\n\n\n                                        18\n\ftrial court must state specific reasons for ordering that amount of child support.\n\nId. § 154.130(a)(3), (b)(4). However, we find no indication in the record that the\n\nchild support award was outside the percentage guidelines. We therefore hold\n\nthat the trial court was not required to make findings under section 154.130. See\n\nid. § 154.130; Deltuva v. Deltuva, 113 S.W.3d 882, 886 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003,\n\nno pet.) (op. on reh’g) (holding that trial court was not required to make child\n\nsupport findings because the written request was filed more than ten days after\n\nthe hearing).\n\n      Having decided against Finley on each of his arguments pertaining to the\n\nchild support orders, we overrule Finley’s second issue.\n\n                               V. ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n      In his third issue, Finley argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding attorney’s fees that were not reasonable, necessary, or equitable.\n\n A. Law on Awarding Attorney’s Fees in a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child\n                        Relationship (SAPCR)\n\n      The trial court has broad discretion in determining the amount of attorney’s\n\nfees in a SAPCR. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 106.002 (West 2014) (stating that\n\nit is within the trial court’s discretion to award reasonable attorney’s fees in a\n\nSAPCR). To support a request for reasonable attorney’s fees, testimony should\n\nbe given regarding the hours spent on the case, the nature of preparation, the\n\ncomplexity of the case, the experience of the attorney, and the prevailing hourly\n\nrates. In re Marriage of C.A.S., 405 S.W.3d 373, 387 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013,\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\fno pet.). While the nature and extent of the legal services performed is typically\n\nexpressed by the number of hours worked and the hourly rate charged, there is\n\nno requirement that both facts be in evidence to make a determination of\n\nattorney’s fees. In re M.M.S., 256 S.W.3d 470, 479 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no\n\npet.); cf. In re Marriage of Pyrtle, 433 S.W.3d 152, 167 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014,\n\npet. denied) (statute providing for attorney’s fees in dissolution of marriage cases\n\ndoes not specifically require attorney’s fees to be determined under the lodestar\n\nmethod).\n\n       B. Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Attorney’s Fees Award\n\n      Finley argues that Lilley’s trial counsel failed to testify regarding the\n\nnumber of hours spent on the case. Here, the record contains testimony from\n\nLilley’s trial counsel that he had been licensed since 1977; that he had been\n\nboard certified since 1983; that his hourly rate of $350 was reasonable and\n\nnecessary; that the issues in this case were exacerbated due to Finley’s lack of\n\ninvolvement in the child’s life and due to extra hearings that would have been\n\nunnecessary if Finley had taken proper action; and that $17,500 in attorney’s\n\nfees was reasonable and necessary in this matter. This testimony is sufficient to\n\nsupport the attorney’s fee award. See In re A.S.G., 345 S.W.3d 443, 451–52\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, no pet.) (holding attorney’s testimony sufficient to\n\nsupport fee award even though she “did not testify to her hourly rate or exact\n\nnumber of hours spent on the case, [but] she did specifically ask for $1,500 in\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fattorney’s fees and explained         to the trial    court   their   necessity and\n\nreasonableness”).9\n\n      Finley also argues in his third issue that the award of attorney’s fees\n\nexceeds his assets and income.        Finley cites no authority, and we have not\n\nlocated any, for his proposition that the award of attorney’s fees in a suit for\n\ndivorce is limited to the amount of a party’s assets and income.10\n\n              C. Segregation of Attorney’s Fees Not Requested\n\n      Additionally, Finley argues that the trial court erred by failing to segregate\n\nthe attorney’s fees. Finley contends that Lilley is an attorney and participated in\n\nthe preparation of some of the documents, but he does not specify how the\n\n\n      9\n        Finley notes that on August 26, 2010, the trial court partially divided the\nparties’ $11,920 tax refund and allowed payment of $4,000 to each party’s\nattorney for attorney’s fees. Finley contends that in awarding attorney’s fees of\n$17,500 in the final decree, the trial court failed to take into account any former\npayments applied. Because Finley points to no evidence showing that the trial\ncourt did not take into account any former payments, and because we have held\nthat the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees,\nwe overrule Finley’s argument. See Parker v. Parker, 897 S.W.2d 918, 935 (Tex.\nApp.—Fort Worth 1995, writ denied) (overruling argument because appellant\nfailed to provide appellate court with sufficient record references to confirm that\ntrial court did not take into account any attorney’s fees that appellant had paid),\noverruled on other grounds by Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio\nEngineers & Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41 (Tex. 1998).\n      10\n        We note that the attorney’s fees were awarded in the final decree; no\nattorney’s fees were assessed in the final protective order. Compare Tex. Fam.\nCode Ann. § 106.002 (giving trial court broad discretion in assessing attorney’s\nfees in a SAPCR), with id. § 81.005(b) (West 2014) (stating that in setting the\namount of attorney’s fees in conjunction with a protective order, trial court shall\nconsider the income and ability to pay of the person against whom fee is\nassessed).\n\n\n                                         21\n\fattorney’s fees should have been segregated. Nor did he request that the trial\n\ncourt segregate the attorney’s fees; therefore, he failed to preserve this issue for\n\nreview. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Moroch v. Collins, 174 S.W.3d 849, 871\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied) (holding that issue challenging trial court’s\n\nfailure to segregate attorney’s fees was not preserved because appellant did not\n\nrequest segregation of attorney’s fees in the trial court). We hold that the trial\n\ncourt did not err by failing to segregate the attorney’s fees.\n\n                D. Attorney’s Fees Related to Protective Order\n\n      Finley further argues in his third issue that some of the attorney’s fees\n\nawarded in the final decree of divorce “may have” been attributable to the\n\nprotective order and should not be taxed to him because the protective order was\n\nentered in error. However, we held above that the protective order is supported\n\nby sufficient evidence and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ngranting Lilley’s application for a protective order. Moreover, Finley points to no\n\nevidence that the attorney’s fees awarded in the final decree related to the final\n\nprotective order.\n\n      We therefore overrule Finley’s third issue.11\n\n\n      11\n         The concluding sentence of Finley’s third issue states, “Therefore, the\ntrial court erred in awarding attorney fees as necessaries or as child support\nsubject to a wage withholding order.” However, none of the arguments that\nprecede this concluding sentence challenge the award of attorney’s fees as\n“necessaries,” nor is there any challenge to the wage withholding order. We\ntherefore hold that Finley has failed to adequately brief this argument. See Tex.\nR. App. P. 38.1(i) (requiring arguments to have appropriate citations to\nauthorities); Fredonia State Bank v. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co., 881 S.W.2d 279, 284\n\n                                         22\n\f                               VI. PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n      In his fourth issue, Finley argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nincluding a permanent injunction in the final decree because Lilley’s pleadings\n\ndid not request such relief.\n\n      When reviewing a judgment granting a permanent injunction, the standard\n\nof review is clear abuse of discretion. Jamestown Partners, L.P. v. City of Fort\n\nWorth, 83 S.W.3d 376, 384 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, pet. denied).               “[A]\n\npermanent injunction must not grant relief which is not prayed for nor be more\n\ncomprehensive or restrictive than justified by the pleadings, the evidence, and\n\nthe usages of equity.”    Holubec v. Brandenberger, 111 S.W.3d 32, 39 (Tex.\n\n2003).\n\n      Here, Lilley’s first amended petition for divorce requests only a temporary\n\nrestraining order and a temporary injunction. Although Lilley proceeded at the\n\ntrial as if she had pleaded for a permanent injunction, she had not, nor had she\n\nrequested the trial court to grant a trial amendment to add a request for a\n\npermanent injunction. A permanent injunction cannot stand in the absence of\n\npleadings requesting such relief, the granting of a trial amendment to add a\n\nrequest for a permanent injunction, or trial of the issue by consent. 12 See In re\n\n\n\n\n(Tex. 1994) (discussing long-standing rule that issue may be waived due to\ninadequate briefing).\n      12\n       Lilley does not claim that the issue was tried by consent but instead\nargues that she requested “injunctive relief” in her first amended petition and her\n\n                                         23\n\fA.A.N., No. 02-13-00151-CV, 2014 WL 3778215, at *2–3 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\nJuly 31, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.). Because Lilley did not plead for a permanent\n\ninjunction, because she did not make a trial amendment adding a request for a\n\npermanent injunction, and because the issue was not tried by consent, we hold\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion by including a permanent injunction in the\n\nfinal decree. See id.; In re N.W., No. 02-12-00057-CV, 2013 WL 5302716, at *11\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth Sept. 19, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.); Falor v. Falor, 840\n\nS.W.2d 683, 687 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1992, no writ) (dissolving the\n\npermanent injunction because petitioner requested only a temporary restraining\n\norder in her pleadings); see also Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Nuckols, 666\n\nS.W.2d 372, 375 (Tex. App.—Eastland 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (stating that “[t]here\n\ncan be no trial by consent on issues decided by a default judgment”).             We\n\ntherefore sustain Finley’s fourth issue, and we dissolve the permanent injunction.\n\n                              VII. PROPERTY DIVISION\n\n      In his fifth issue, Finley argues that the trial court failed to make a just and\n\nright property division.\n\n     A. Access to Separate Property Located within Marital Residence\n\n      Finley argues that the trial court’s property division was not just and right\n\nbecause the final decree contained no provision that granted Finley access to\n\nLilley’s residence to obtain his separate property and because the final protective\n\napplication for protective order.     Neither document requested a permanent\ninjunction.\n\n\n                                         24\n\forder hampered his access to this residence. Finley, however, fails to appreciate\n\nthe distinction between Lilley’s residence and the marital residence. The final\n\ndecree granted Finley access to the marital residence for a limited time to allow\n\nhim to retrieve any of his separate property that remained there. In contrast, the\n\nfinal protective order prohibited Finley from coming within a certain distance of\n\nLilley’s residence, the location of which the trial court agreed to keep confidential.\n\nThe marital residence was not Lilley’s residence; Lilley testified that the marital\n\nresidence was “just sitting there,” that it had a lockbox on it, and that she planned\n\nto sell it. Because the final protective order did not limit Finley’s ability to access\n\nhis separate property located at the marital residence and because the final\n\ndecree specifically granted Finley temporary access to the marital residence\n\nbefore it was sold, Finley has not shown that the trial court’s property division\n\nwas not just and right.\n\n      Finley also argues that the trial court’s property division was not just and\n\nright because the final decree required him to remove his personal property from\n\nthe marital residence by December 15, 2010, even though the final decree was\n\nnot signed until December 29, 2010.         Finley argues that the impossibility of\n\nacquiring his belongings resulted in the forfeiture of his interest in “some personal\n\nproperty.”   Even assuming that it was error for the trial court to include a\n\nDecember 15, 2010 deadline in the December 29, 2010 final decree, Finley fails\n\nto detail what items of separate property he forfeited and their value to show that\n\nthe resulting property division was not just and right. See generally Hinton v.\n\n\n                                          25\n\fBurns, 433 S.W.3d 189, 201 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, no pet.) (stating that\n\nburden is on party challenging property division to show that division was so\n\ndisproportionate and thus unfair that it constituted an abuse of discretion);\n\nZeptner v. Zeptner, 111 S.W.3d 727, 740 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.)\n\n(op. on reh’g) (stating that a just and right division does not have to be equal; it\n\nneed only be equitable). We therefore hold that Finley has failed to show harm\n\nfrom the alleged failure to retrieve his separate property from the marital\n\nresidence. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a).\n\n                         B. Value of Community Assets\n\n      Finley also argues in his fifth issue that the trial court erred in dividing the\n\ncommunity property because it used values that were not in evidence. Finley,\n\nhowever, does not explain what values the trial court used that were not in\n\nevidence; instead, he directs us to exhibit two, which is entitled “Inventory and\n\nAppraisement of Marguerite Breanne Finley.” During the divorce proceeding, the\n\ntrial court admitted exhibit two into evidence. Having no reason to believe that\n\nthe trial court based the division of community property on any other values, we\n\nconclude that the trial court based its division on the values shown on exhibit two\n\nthat was admitted during the trial.\n\n      Finley further argues that the trial court was “mistaken in admitting the\n\nPetitioner’s Sworn Inventory & Appraisement pursuant to Parker” and therefore\n\nerred by dividing the community property based on Lilley’s inventory and\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fappraisement because those values did not reflect the values on the date of the\n\ndivorce.\n\n      The value of community assets is generally determined as of the date of\n\ndivorce or as close to that date as possible. Quijano v. Quijano, 347 S.W.3d 345,\n\n349 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.). However, we have held that\n\nthe facts of a particular case may necessitate some other basis for the property\n\ndivision and that this decision should be left to the discretion of the trial judge to\n\navoid the inequities that could result by establishing a bright-line rule.       See\n\nParker, 897 S.W.2d at 932. Whichever approach we take, the cases that discuss\n\nthe proper date of valuation discuss it in the context of the choice being between\n\nthe date of the divorce and the date on which the property is subsequently\n\ndivided when these events occur on different dates. See, e.g., Grossnickle v.\n\nGrossnickle, 935 S.W.2d 830, 836–37 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1996, writ denied)\n\n(“Generally, community assets are to be evaluated as of the time of the divorce,\n\nand subsequent increases in value are separate property.”); Parker, 897 S.W.2d\n\nat 932.\n\n      Here, the trial court did not face this decision because it made the property\n\ndivision on the same date that it granted the divorce. Finley nonetheless argues\n\nthat the trial court should have used values that were ascertained closer to the\n\ndate of the final trial on November 30, 2010, rather than those that Lilley\n\nsubmitted on February 17, 2010.        Even under the stricter general rule, the\n\nrequirement is that trial courts must use a value that was determined as close to\n\n\n                                         27\n\fthe date of divorce as possible. Quijano, 347 S.W.3d at 350. Here, the trial court\n\nordered both parties to submit a sworn inventory and appraisement of all\n\nseparate and community property, but only Lilley submitted an inventory to the\n\ntrial court.   Lilley’s inventory and appraisement was thus the best evidence\n\npresented to the trial court regarding the value of the parties’ property. See id.\n\nThe trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion by dividing the property\n\nbased on the most recent values that the trial court had before it.        See id.\n\n(holding that using values from six-month-old bank statement did not render\n\nevidence insufficient to support trial court’s assessment of value in checking\n\naccount and did not render trial court’s division of property manifestly unjust and\n\nunfair because appellant did not appear and present his own evidence).\n\n                   C. Division Based on Personality Factors\n\n       Finley additionally argues that “to the extent that the division of personal\n\nproperty was based on a lack of courtroom decorum which is alleged to have\n\noccurred in another location, the trial court should not have based a division of\n\nmarital property on personality factors” because Lilley “did not plead for a just\n\nand right division based on ‘erratic behavior in court.’” Finley appears to tie his\n\nargument to the trial court’s order requiring him to pay the entire amount of\n\nattorney’s fees.   We have reviewed the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees\n\nabove and have found no abuse of discretion.\n\n       Having decided against Finley on each of his arguments pertaining to the\n\nproperty division, we therefore overrule Finley’s fifth issue.\n\n\n                                          28\n\f                             VIII. MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n\n      In his sixth issue, Finley appears to argue that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying his motion for new trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(f), 38.9\n\n(directing appellate courts to liberally construe briefs and address every issue\n\nfairly included within a point presented for review).       Finley contends that his\n\nfailure to appear at the final trial on the petition for divorce was due to a mistake.\n\n      A default judgment should be set aside and a new trial granted when the\n\ndefaulting party establishes that (1) the failure to appear was not intentional or\n\nthe result of conscious indifference but was the result of an accident or mistake,\n\n(2) the motion for new trial sets up a meritorious defense, and (3) granting the\n\nmotion will occasion no delay or otherwise injure the plaintiff. Dolgencorp of\n\nTex., Inc. v. Lerma, 288 S.W.3d 922, 925 (Tex. 2009); Craddock v. Sunshine Bus\n\nLines, Inc., 134 Tex. 388, 393, 133 S.W.2d 124, 126 (1939). When a defaulting\n\nparty moving for a new trial meets all three elements of the Craddock test, then a\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion if it fails to grant a new trial.13 Lerma, 288 S.W.3d\n\nat 926.\n\n      With regard to the first prong of the Craddock test, Finley’s motion for new\n\ntrial stated only the following:\n\n      A new trial should be granted to Movant because this Court abused\n      its discretion [by] permitting the withdrawal of counsel for\n      Respondent on November 17, 2010[,] without allowing time for\n\n      13\n      The Craddock test applies to no-answer and post-answer default\njudgments. Ivy v. Carrell, 407 S.W.2d 212, 213 (Tex. 1966).\n\n\n                                          29\n\f      substitution of counsel and not holding a hearing on Movant’s\n      request for a continuance of the trial setting on November 30, 2010.\n\nNowhere within or in addition to these conclusory allegations did Finley provide\n\nan excuse for his failure to appear. See Dir., State Emps. Workers’ Comp. Div.\n\nv. Evans, 889 S.W.2d 266, 268 (Tex. 1994). Because Finley failed to satisfy the\n\nfirst prong of Craddock, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\noverruling Finley’s motion for new trial. See Lerma, 288 S.W.3d at 926. We\n\ntherefore overrule the portion of Finley’s sixth issue related to the denial of his\n\nmotion for new trial.\n\n      Finley also argues within his sixth issue that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by failing to rule on his motion for continuance.14 Assuming, without\n\ndeciding, that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on his motion\n\nfor continuance, Finley failed to show how he was harmed. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.1(a). Although Finley argues that the trial court’s failure to rule on his motion\n\nfor continuance caused him to mistakenly believe that his motion had been\n\ngranted and that the trial date had been continued, he does not cite any authority\n\n      14\n         Although we find no express ruling denying the motion for continuance,\nthe trial court’s act of proceeding with the trial and rendering judgment against\nFinley in the face of his pending motion for continuance constitutes an implicit\ndenial of his motion for purposes of our review of this complaint. See Tex. R.\nApp. P. 33.1(a)(2)(A); Carter v. MacFadyen, 93 S.W.3d 307, 310 n.2 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (deciding that the dismissal of a\nparty’s claims at trial constituted an implicit denial of the party’s motion for\ncontinuance); Williams v. Bank One, Tex., N.A., 15 S.W.3d 110, 114 (Tex.\nApp.—Waco 1999, no pet.) (“[T]he trial court’s granting of Bank One’s summary\njudgment creates an inference that the court implicitly overruled Williams’s\nmotion for continuance.”).\n\n\n                                         30\n\ffor the proposition that a motion is impliedly granted while it is pending.           If\n\nanything is implied from the trial court’s failure to rule on his motion, it is that his\n\nmotion was denied. See In re T.G., No. 03-02-00090-CV, 2002 WL 31769031, at\n\n*2 (Tex. App.—Austin Dec. 12, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication)\n\n(holding that trial court’s failure to rule on a motion for continuance, even if\n\nimproper, caused no harm and that trial court implicitly denied the motion by\n\nholding the hearing that appellant had requested to be postponed). Moreover,\n\nFinley did not verify his motion for continuance or support it with an affidavit. See\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 251 (requiring motion for continuance to be supported by\n\naffidavit). If a motion for continuance is not verified or supported by affidavit, we\n\nwill presume that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion\n\nfor continuance. See Moreno v. Silva, 316 S.W.3d 815, 818 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2010, pet. denied).     We therefore hold that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by implicitly denying Finley’s motion for continuance.              See id.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule the portion of Finley’s sixth issue related to his motion\n\nfor continuance.\n\n       Finley further argues in his sixth issue that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing his trial counsel to withdraw and providing a deadline after\n\nthe trial date for his trial counsel to forward Finley his file. When a trial court\n\nallows an attorney to voluntarily withdraw, it must give the party time to secure\n\nnew counsel and time for the new counsel to investigate the case and prepare for\n\ntrial. See Villegas v. Carter, 711 S.W.2d 624, 626–27 (Tex. 1986); Moreno, 316\n\n\n                                          31\n\fS.W.3d at 818.     Here, Finley had almost two weeks to secure new counsel.\n\nFinley does not argue that this was not enough time to obtain an attorney or for\n\nan attorney to prepare for trial, nor does he argue or point to anything in the\n\nrecord to demonstrate that he had tried to hire a new attorney.15 See Moreno,\n\n316 S.W.3d at 818 (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, in\n\npart, because nothing in the record showed that the appellant had tried to hire an\n\nattorney after his attorney withdrew). We therefore hold that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion by granting Finley’s attorney’s motion to withdraw.16 See id.\n\nWe therefore overrule the remainder of Finley’s sixth issue.\n\n                                 IX. CONCLUSION\n\n      Having sustained Finley’s fourth issue, we dissolve the trial court’s\n\npermanent injunction and modify the final decree to omit any reference to the\n\npermanent injunction. Having overruled Finley’s second, third, fifth, and sixth\n\nissues, we affirm the granting of the divorce and the remainder of the final decree\n\n\n      15\n        The only specific error of which Finley complains is that the trial court’s\norder gave Finley’s trial attorney fifteen days to forward trial documents to Finley\nwhen only thirteen days remained before trial. Even if this constituted an abuse\nof discretion, Finley does not argue that his trial attorney waited fifteen days or\nany length of time to deliver the documents. Finley therefore has not shown any\nreversible error by the trial court. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a).\n      16\n          To the extent that Finley argues in one sentence that he was denied due\nprocess because his attorney was allowed to withdraw, he did not raise this issue\nin the trial court and therefore did not preserve this issue for review. See Tex. R.\nApp. P. 33.1(a); In re D.T.M., 932 S.W.2d 647, 652 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996,\nno writ) (“Even constitutional arguments are waived at the appellate level if\nissues were not before the trial court.”).\n\n\n                                         32\n\fas modified. Having overruled Finley’s first issue, we affirm the final protective\n\norder.\n\n                                                  PER CURIAM\n\nPANEL: WALKER, DAUPHINOT, and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: January 22, 2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       33\n\f",

INTRODUCTION2\n\n      In twenty-seven issues,3 Appellant Tayton Seth Finley appeals both the\n\nfinal decree of divorce dissolving his marriage to Appellee Marguerite Breanne\n\nFinley (Lilley)4 and the final protective order entered against him. Because the\n\nrecord reveals that Lilley did not plead for a permanent injunction, we will\n\ndissolve the trial court’s permanent injunction and modify the final decree to omit\n\nany reference to the permanent injunction. We will affirm the granting of the\n\n\n\n      2\n       This case was originally submitted without oral argument on September\n28, 2011, before a panel consisting of Justice Dauphinot, Justice Gardner, and\nJustice McCoy. After submission, the court was notified that a petition for\nbankruptcy had been filed, which suspended the appeal, and on January 11,\n2012, the court issued an order staying the case. The bankruptcy case was\nclosed on November 14, 2013; was reopened on May 15, 2014; and was closed\nagain five days later on May 20, 2014. The motion to reinstate was not filed until\nNovember 18, 2014. This court granted Appellant’s motion to reinstate;\nresubmitted the case without oral argument; and assigned this case to a new\npanel, consisting of Justice Dauphinot, Justice Walker, and Justice Meier. We\nare concerned that the delay between the December 29, 2010 divorce decree\nand our disposition of this appeal over four years later has caused many of the\nissues concerning the parties’ divorce, child support, and property division to\nbecome stale.\n      3\n        Appellant’s brief lists issues one through thirty, but the issues are not\nconsecutively numbered, omitting numbers fifteen through seventeen. After\nsetting forth his twenty-seven issues, Finley abandons his numbered issues and\ninstead raises arguments related to the following: (1) the protective order, (2) the\nchild support, (3) the attorney’s fees, (4) the permanent injunction, (5) the\nproperty division, and (6) the motion for new trial. We therefore address these six\nissues.\n      4\n        At the conclusion of the divorce trial, the trial court granted Marguerite’s\nrequest that her last name be changed back to her maiden name of Lilley, which\nis the name by which we refer to her in this opinion.\n\n\n                                         2\n\fdivorce and the remainder of the final decree as modified, and we will affirm the\n\nfinal protective order.\n\n                                  II. BACKGROUND\n\n      Finley and Lilley married in 2005 and had a son in 2008. In late December\n\n2009, Finley committed family violence when he broke into his mother’s home by\n\nthrowing a brick through the glass French doors, tried to take his son from Lilley,\n\nand punched Lilley in the face. The following month, Lilley filed a petition for\n\ndivorce and an application for a protective order, both of which Finley answered.\n\nThe trial court specially set the final trial for November 30, 2010.\n\n      On November 11, 2010, Finley’s attorney filed a motion for withdrawal of\n\ncounsel, citing her inability to effectively communicate with Finley. The trial court\n\ngranted the motion to withdraw on November 17, 2010; noted that Finley had\n\nbeen informed that the final trial was set for November 30, 2010; and gave\n\nFinley’s attorney fifteen days to provide Finley with all documents relating to his\n\ncase. Also on November 17, Finley filed an unverified motion for continuance\n\nwithout attaching an affidavit, and the motion was impliedly overruled.\n\n      Finley did not appear for trial on November 30, 2010.            After hearing\n\ntestimony from Lilley, the trial court granted the divorce and awarded Lilley\n\ncurrent child support of $479 per month; retroactive child support of $5,269; the\n\n2009 tax refund; the marital residence; sole managing conservatorship; a\n\nprotective order; a permanent injunction; and her attorney’s fees. The trial court\n\nawarded Finley his personal property and gave him until December 15, 2010, to\n\n\n                                          3\n\fremove his personal property from the marital residence. Finley filed a motion for\n\nnew trial and requested findings of fact and conclusions of law.            He then\n\nperfected this appeal.\n\n                              III. PROTECTIVE ORDER\n\n      In his first issue, Finley argues that the final protective order was entered in\n\nerror. Finley contends that he received inadequate notice that Lilley’s application\n\nfor a protective order would be heard at the final trial, which denied him due\n\nprocess; that he should have been appointed an attorney for the protective order\n\nhearing; and that the evidence is insufficient to support the protective order.\n\n                                   A. Mootness\n\n      Because the final protective order expired on November 30, 2012, our first\n\ndetermination must be whether Finley’s appeal from the final protective order is\n\nmoot. The general rule is that a case becomes moot, and thus unreviewable,\n\nwhen it appears that a party seeks to obtain relief on some alleged controversy\n\nwhen in reality none exists. Williams v. Lara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743723/williams-v-lara/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (Tex. 2001). If\n\na case becomes moot, the parties lose their standing to maintain their claims. Id.\n\n      Texas law, however, recognizes a collateral consequences exception to\n\nthe mootness doctrine. FDIC v. Nueces Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529176\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529176/federal-deposit-ins-corp-v-nueces-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (Tex. 1994).\n\nThe collateral consequences exception has been applied when prejudicial events\n\nhave occurred that will continue to stigmatize the person long after the judgment\n\nhas ceased to operate.      In re Cummings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2104623\"><a href=\"/opinion/2104623/in-re-cummings/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 2000, no pet.).\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       Appeals of expired protective orders issued for family violence often fall\n\ninto this collateral consequences exception because although such orders may\n\nultimately expire, the social stigma attached to them generally does not.\n\nSchaban-Maurer v. Maurer-Schaban, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2361958\"><a href=\"/opinion/2361958/schaban-maurer-v-maurer-schaban/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822–23 (Tex.

Moreover, there are attendant legal consequences to being the\n\nsubject of such a protective order. Id. at 823 (citing Texas Family Code section\n\n153.004(f) and noting that the family code requires courts to consider a history of\n\ndomestic violence when determining child custody).\n\n       Under the collateral consequences exception, the expiration of the\n\nprotective order in this case does not render Finley’s appeal from the final\n\nprotective order moot. See id. We will therefore review the substance of Finley’s\n\nchallenges to the protective order.\n\n                                      B. Notice\n\n       Finley argues that he was denied due process because he received\n\ninadequate notice that Lilley’s application for a protective order would be heard at\n\nthe final trial.\n\n       A court may render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who\n\ndoes not attend a hearing if the respondent received service of the application\n\nand notice of the hearing. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 85.006 (West 2014).         Under\n\nthe presumption of regularity of judgments, we presume the recitations in the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fcourt’s judgment are correct absent any evidence to the contrary.                In re\n\nGuardianship of Winn, 372 S.W3d 291, 298 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.).\n\n      Here, the final protective order recites that “Respondent, Tayton Seth\n\nFinley, although duly and properly cited, did not appear and wholly made\n\ndefault.” The record reveals that on January 26, 2010, Finley was served with\n\nLilley’s application for a protective order and was given notice that the hearing on\n\nLilley’s application would occur on February 8, 2010. On February 8, 2010, the\n\nassociate judge’s report notes that the protective order hearing was extended\n\nuntil the reset date. On February 16, 2010, the hearing on the application for\n\nprotective order was reset to February 24, 2010. The record does not contain a\n\nrecord or a report from any February 24 hearing. The application for a protective\n\norder was not mentioned at subsequent status conferences but appears to have\n\nbeen carried until the final trial. Finley admits that he had notice of the final trial\n\nand yet did not appear.\n\n      The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals dealt with a similar situation in\n\nCummings.      13 S.W.3d at 475–76.        In Cummings, both parties filed for a\n\nprotective order and noticed hearings. Id. at 475. The initial hearing on the\n\nwife’s protective order did not occur. Id. When the husband set a hearing on his\n\nmotion for protective order for June 15, 1998, the wife asked for and received a\n\ncontinuance. Id. at 475–76. The wife then noticed July 17 as a hearing date for\n\nher application. Id. At the July 17 hearing, the husband asked the trial court to\n\nconsider his application as well, but the wife insisted that she had not received\n\n\n                                          6\n\fnotice that the husband’s application would be considered at that day’s hearing.\n\nId. at 476. The trial court indicated his desire to consider both applications in one\n\nhearing, but when the wife continued to resist, the trial court stated, “Okay. We’ll\n\nstart it and recess it then.” Id. The wife began presenting evidence in support of\n\nher application, but the trial court recessed the hearing before she had finished.\n\nId. When the case reconvened on July 22, the husband again asked to proceed\n\nwith his application, and the wife resisted, arguing that the husband had never\n\nnoticed a hearing date for his application. Id. The trial court found that the wife\n\nhad sufficient notice of the hearing on the husband’s application and proceeded\n\nwith hearing both applications. Id. On appeal, the wife argued that the trial court\n\nerred by considering the husband’s application at the July 22 hearing. Id. The\n\nCorpus Christi Court of Appeals held that even assuming the trial court did err,\n\nthe wife failed to show how she was harmed by the error. Id.\n\n      In the case before us, even assuming that the trial court did err by hearing\n\nLilley’s application for a protective order on the same date as the final trial, Finley\n\nhas failed to show how he was harmed by the error. Before reversing a trial\n\ncourt judgment, we must conclude that an error probably caused the rendition of\n\nan improper judgment or probably prevented the appellant from properly\n\npresenting the case to the court of appeals. Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a). Neither\n\nconclusion is warranted here.       Finley does not argue that he would have\n\nappeared for the final trial had he known that the trial court was also hearing\n\nLilley’s application for a protective order. Nor does he argue in his brief what\n\n\n                                          7\n\fwitnesses he would have summoned, what their testimony would have been, or\n\nwhat other evidence he would have put on that would have led the trial court to\n\nreach a different conclusion.5      We hold that Finley has not demonstrated\n\nreversible error from any alleged lack of notice regarding the hearing on Lilley’s\n\napplication for a protective order. See Cummings, 13 S.W.3d at 476.\n\n                                  C. Due Process\n\n         Finley also argues that he was denied due process with regard to the\n\nprotective order. We note that Finley did not raise this issue in his motion for\n\nnew trial. Moreover, due process requires that Finley be given the opportunity to\n\nbe heard, but he waived that right by failing to attend the hearing. See Hunt v.\n\nState, No. 03-11-00352-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3793283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Tex.

See id. at *2–3 (holding that appellant’s right to due process was not\n\nviolated when he failed to attend hearing and default protective order was\n\nentered).\n\n                            D. Right to Representation\n\n         With regard to Finley’s argument that he had a right to be represented by\n\nan attorney at the hearing on Lilley’s application for a protective order, we have\n\npreviously held that there is no constitutional or statutory right to counsel in a\n\nprotective order case.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Finley’s first issue also appears to challenge the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the protective order, arguing that he had denied any basis\n\nfor a protective order and had specifically denied Lilley’s claims of criminal\n\nconduct.\n\n       Although there is a split among the courts of appeals, in this court we\n\nreview appellate challenges to the granting of protective orders for sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence, measured by legal and factual sufficiency contentions.

Tex. Fam. Code\n\nAnn. §§ 81.001, 85.001(b) (West 2014). Family violence means an act by a\n\nmember of a family or household against another member of the family or\n\nhousehold that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or\n\n\n                                         10\n\fsexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in fear of\n\nimminent physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault, but does not\n\ninclude defensive measures to protect oneself. Id. § 71.004(1) (West 2014).\n\n       Here, the record contains Lilley’s uncontroverted testimony that during\n\ntheir separation, Finley broke into his mother’s home, where Lilley and his son\n\nwere staying, by throwing a brick through the glass French doors and tried to\n\ntake their son from Lilley. When Lilley would not allow Finley to take their son,\n\nFinley grabbed Lilley’s glasses off her face and punched her in the face, splitting\n\nher eye.

Because we have held that the\nevidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s granting of Lilley’s application for\na protective order and because Finley’s assertion does not provide any avenue\nfor relief, we need not address his assertion. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1 (requiring\nappellate court to address every issue necessary for final disposition of appeal).\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                                IV. CHILD SUPPORT\n\n      In his second issue, Finley argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it entered the child support order.        Finley appears to challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s calculation of current child\n\nsupport and retroactive child support.\n\n                             A. Standard of Review\n\n      A trial court has discretion to set child support within the parameters\n\nprovided by the family code, and we will not disturb the trial court’s child support\n\norder unless the complaining party shows a clear abuse of discretion. Iliff, 339\n\nS.W.3d at 78; see Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 154.121–.123 (West 2014). A trial\n\ncourt abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, without\n\nreference to guiding rules or principles, or when it fails to analyze or apply the\n\nlaw correctly. Iliff, 339 S.W.3d at 78. Legal and factual sufficiency challenges\n\nare not independent grounds of error; rather, they are relevant factors in\n\nassessing whether the trial court abused its discretion.        Newberry v. Bohn-\n\nNewberry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2184051\"><a href=\"/opinion/2184051/newberry-v-bohn-newberry/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\nWhen an appellant alleges that the trial court abused its discretion because the\n\nevidence was insufficient, this court employs a two-prong test: first, we must ask\n\nwhether the trial court had sufficient information on which to exercise its\n\ndiscretion; and second, we determine whether the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby causing the child support order to be manifestly unjust or unfair. Id. The trial\n\ncourt does not abuse its discretion when its decision is based on conflicting\n\n\n                                         12\n\fevidence or where some evidence of probative and substantive character exists\n\nto support the child support order. Id. We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the trial court’s decision and indulge every reasonable presumption\n\nin favor of the trial court’s judgment. Id.\n\n                          B. Child Support Calculations\n\n      Within his second issue, Finley argues that the trial court erred by relying\n\non Lilley’s testimony regarding his past financial aid to calculate his resources\n\ninstead of utilizing the federal minimum wage as the basis for his resources.\n\n                      1. Law on Calculating Child Support\n\n      The family code instructs the trial court to calculate net resources for the\n\npurpose of determining child support liability. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.062\n\n(West 2014). There must be some evidence of a substantive and probative\n\ncharacter of net resources in order for the trial court to discharge this duty.\n\nNewberry, 146 S.W.3d at 236.          “Resources” is defined as various types of\n\n“income actually being received.” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.062(b). In the\n\nabsence of evidence of a party’s resources, the court shall presume that the\n\nparty has wages or salary equal to the federal minimum wage for a forty-hour\n\nweek. Id. § 154.068 (West 2014). After determining a party’s resources, the trial\n\ncourt shall deduct taxes and expenses for the cost of health insurance or cash\n\nmedical support for the obligor’s child ordered by the court under section\n\n154.182; the amount ascertained after subtracting the preceding deductions from\n\nthe party’s resources equals the net resources available for child support. Id.\n\n\n                                          13\n\f§ 154.062(d). The child support obligation is then determined by applying the\n\nstatutory guidelines to the party’s net resources. Id. § 154.125 (West 2014). The\n\nfamily code sets a guideline that an obligor who has two children should pay child\n\nsupport equal to twenty percent of the first $7,500 of his monthly net resources.\n\nId.\n\n                              2. Evidence at Trial\n\n      Here, Lilley testified that Finley was previously in medical school in\n\nTennessee and that he had received between $35,000 and $40,000 in\n\ngovernment and private loans each year when he was attending medical school.\n\nLilley testified that Finley was “currently suspended” from medical school for\n\nbehavioral problems but that he hoped to be readmitted to medical school. Lilley\n\ntestified that Finley had not worked since they had separated in December 2009.\n\nLilley asked the trial court to base the child support amount “on just whatever the\n\nminimum wage job is” or on $35,000. The trial court later asked Lilley whether\n\nFinley had received any other financial help, and she responded that in addition\n\nto the government loans and private loans he had received, his family had “been\n\nsupporting him the past year.” She said that they paid for his groceries, “running\n\nmoney,” his car, and gas, and she estimated that the support totaled at least\n\n$500 per month. After hearing Lilley’s testimony, the trial court based its child\n\nsupport orders on an annual income of $35,000; ordered Finley to pay $479 per\n\nmonth in current child support; and ordered Finley to pay retroactive child support\n\nin the amount of $5,269—eleven months’ child support for the time since the\n\n\n                                        14\n\fpetition for divorce was filed in January 2010 to the trial in November 2010—to\n\nbe paid at the rate of $300 per month.\n\n                                    3. Analysis\n\n      Lilley’s testimony demonstrates that Finley had received monies from his\n\nfamily totaling at least $6,000 per year and from financial aid sources totaling\n\n$35,000 to $40,000 per year. Lilley’s testimony regarding these amounts was\n\nundisputed. Finley was not in court and did not cross-examine Lilley or present\n\nany evidence regarding his past or present income or whether his receipt of loan\n\nor aid monies changed as a result of his suspension from medical school while\n\nhe sought readmission. Because the duty to pay child support is not limited to an\n\nobligor’s ability to pay from earnings but also includes his ability to pay from any\n\nand all sources that may be available, the trial court was entitled to base its child\n\nsupport calculation on the gifts that Finley had received from his family and the\n\nproceeds of his financial aid and private loans, which constitute resources within\n\nthe meaning of section 154.062(b)(5).

Required Findings\n\n      Within his second issue, Finley also argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by failing to make the required findings under section 154.130.\n\n      In rendering an order of child support, the trial court is required to make\n\nfindings if a party files a written request with the court not later than ten days after\n\nthe date of the hearing, a party makes an oral request in open court during the\n\nhearing, or the amount of child support ordered by the court varies from the\n\namount computed by applying the percentage guidelines under section 154.125.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.130(a) (West 2014). If findings are required under\n\nsection 154.130, the trial court shall state whether the application of the\n\n\n                                          17\n\fguidelines would be unjust or inappropriate and shall state the net resources of\n\nthe obligor per month, the net resources of the obligee per month, the\n\npercentage applied to the obligor’s net resources for child support, and the\n\nspecific reasons that the amount of child support per month ordered by the court\n\nvaries from the amount computed by applying the percentage guidelines under\n\nsection 154.125. Id. § 154.130(b).\n\n      Finley contends that his January 28, 2011 request for findings triggered the\n\ntrial court’s duty to make the required findings regarding net resources. See id.\n\nHowever, in order to trigger this duty, the party must request these findings no\n\nlater than ten days after the date of the hearing that resulted in the order. Id.\n\n§ 154.130(a)(1). Because the trial court held the hearing that resulted in the child\n\nsupport order on November 30, 2010, Finley’s January 28, 2011 request was\n\nuntimely.8 See id.\n\n      Even without a proper request, if the child support amount varies from the\n\namount computed by applying the percentage guidelines in the family code, the\n\n      8\n       Finley contends that his request was effective because he filed it within\nthe court’s thirty-day plenary period. However, even under rule 296, he would\nhave been required to submit his request no later than twenty days from the date\non which the trial court signed the judgment. See Tex. R. Civ.

ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n      In his third issue, Finley argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding attorney’s fees that were not reasonable, necessary, or equitable.\n\n A. Law on Awarding Attorney’s Fees in a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child\n                        Relationship (SAPCR)\n\n      The trial court has broad discretion in determining the amount of attorney’s\n\nfees in a SAPCR. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 106.002 (West 2014) (stating that\n\nit is within the trial court’s discretion to award reasonable attorney’s fees in a\n\nSAPCR). To support a request for reasonable attorney’s fees, testimony should\n\nbe given regarding the hours spent on the case, the nature of preparation, the\n\ncomplexity of the case, the experience of the attorney, and the prevailing hourly\n\nrates.

While the nature and extent of the legal services performed is typically\n\nexpressed by the number of hours worked and the hourly rate charged, there is\n\nno requirement that both facts be in evidence to make a determination of\n\nattorney’s fees.

Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Attorney’s Fees Award\n\n      Finley argues that Lilley’s trial counsel failed to testify regarding the\n\nnumber of hours spent on the case. Here, the record contains testimony from\n\nLilley’s trial counsel that he had been licensed since 1977; that he had been\n\nboard certified since 1983; that his hourly rate of $350 was reasonable and\n\nnecessary; that the issues in this case were exacerbated due to Finley’s lack of\n\ninvolvement in the child’s life and due to extra hearings that would have been\n\nunnecessary if Finley had taken proper action; and that $17,500 in attorney’s\n\nfees was reasonable and necessary in this matter. This testimony is sufficient to\n\nsupport the attorney’s fee award. See In re A.S.G., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548428\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548428/in-re-asg/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451–52\n\n(Tex.

Finley cites no authority, and we have not\n\nlocated any, for his proposition that the award of attorney’s fees in a suit for\n\ndivorce is limited to the amount of a party’s assets and income.10\n\n              C. Segregation of Attorney’s Fees Not Requested\n\n      Additionally, Finley argues that the trial court erred by failing to segregate\n\nthe attorney’s fees. Finley contends that Lilley is an attorney and participated in\n\nthe preparation of some of the documents, but he does not specify how the\n\n\n      9\n        Finley notes that on August 26, 2010, the trial court partially divided the\nparties’ $11,920 tax refund and allowed payment of $4,000 to each party’s\nattorney for attorney’s fees. Finley contends that in awarding attorney’s fees of\n$17,500 in the final decree, the trial court failed to take into account any former\npayments applied. Because Finley points to no evidence showing that the trial\ncourt did not take into account any former payments, and because we have held\nthat the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees,\nwe overrule Finley’s argument.

Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1692335\"><a href=\"/opinion/1692335/moroch-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied) (holding that issue challenging trial court’s\n\nfailure to segregate attorney’s fees was not preserved because appellant did not\n\nrequest segregation of attorney’s fees in the trial court). We hold that the trial\n\ncourt did not err by failing to segregate the attorney’s fees.\n\n                D. Attorney’s Fees Related to Protective Order\n\n      Finley further argues in his third issue that some of the attorney’s fees\n\nawarded in the final decree of divorce “may have” been attributable to the\n\nprotective order and should not be taxed to him because the protective order was\n\nentered in error. However, we held above that the protective order is supported\n\nby sufficient evidence and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ngranting Lilley’s application for a protective order. Moreover, Finley points to no\n\nevidence that the attorney’s fees awarded in the final decree related to the final\n\nprotective order.\n\n      We therefore overrule Finley’s third issue.11\n\n\n      11\n         The concluding sentence of Finley’s third issue states, “Therefore, the\ntrial court erred in awarding attorney fees as necessaries or as child support\nsubject to a wage withholding order.” However, none of the arguments that\nprecede this concluding sentence challenge the award of attorney’s fees as\n“necessaries,” nor is there any challenge to the wage withholding order. We\ntherefore hold that Finley has failed to adequately brief this argument. See Tex.\nR. App. P. 38.1(i) (requiring arguments to have appropriate citations to\nauthorities); Fredonia State Bank v.

PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n      In his fourth issue, Finley argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nincluding a permanent injunction in the final decree because Lilley’s pleadings\n\ndid not request such relief.\n\n      When reviewing a judgment granting a permanent injunction, the standard\n\nof review is clear abuse of discretion.

A permanent injunction cannot stand in the absence of\n\npleadings requesting such relief, the granting of a trial amendment to add a\n\nrequest for a permanent injunction, or trial of the issue by consent. 12 See In re\n\n\n\n\n(Tex. 1994) (discussing long-standing rule that issue may be waived due to\ninadequate briefing).\n      12\n       Lilley does not claim that the issue was tried by consent but instead\nargues that she requested “injunctive relief” in her first amended petition and her\n\n                                         23\n\fA.A.N., No. 02-13-00151-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3778215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2–3 (Tex.

We\n\ntherefore sustain Finley’s fourth issue, and we dissolve the permanent injunction.\n\n                              VII. PROPERTY DIVISION\n\n      In his fifth issue, Finley argues that the trial court failed to make a just and\n\nright property division.\n\n     A. Access to Separate Property Located within Marital Residence\n\n      Finley argues that the trial court’s property division was not just and right\n\nbecause the final decree contained no provision that granted Finley access to\n\nLilley’s residence to obtain his separate property and because the final protective\n\napplication for protective order.     Neither document requested a permanent\ninjunction.\n\n\n                                         24\n\forder hampered his access to this residence. Finley, however, fails to appreciate\n\nthe distinction between Lilley’s residence and the marital residence. The final\n\ndecree granted Finley access to the marital residence for a limited time to allow\n\nhim to retrieve any of his separate property that remained there. In contrast, the\n\nfinal protective order prohibited Finley from coming within a certain distance of\n\nLilley’s residence, the location of which the trial court agreed to keep confidential.\n\nThe marital residence was not Lilley’s residence; Lilley testified that the marital\n\nresidence was “just sitting there,” that it had a lockbox on it, and that she planned\n\nto sell it. Because the final protective order did not limit Finley’s ability to access\n\nhis separate property located at the marital residence and because the final\n\ndecree specifically granted Finley temporary access to the marital residence\n\nbefore it was sold, Finley has not shown that the trial court’s property division\n\nwas not just and right.\n\n      Finley also argues that the trial court’s property division was not just and\n\nright because the final decree required him to remove his personal property from\n\nthe marital residence by December 15, 2010, even though the final decree was\n\nnot signed until December 29, 2010.         Finley argues that the impossibility of\n\nacquiring his belongings resulted in the forfeiture of his interest in “some personal\n\nproperty.”   Even assuming that it was error for the trial court to include a\n\nDecember 15, 2010 deadline in the December 29, 2010 final decree, Finley fails\n\nto detail what items of separate property he forfeited and their value to show that\n\nthe resulting property division was not just and right.

App. P. 44.1(a).\n\n                         B. Value of Community Assets\n\n      Finley also argues in his fifth issue that the trial court erred in dividing the\n\ncommunity property because it used values that were not in evidence. Finley,\n\nhowever, does not explain what values the trial court used that were not in\n\nevidence; instead, he directs us to exhibit two, which is entitled “Inventory and\n\nAppraisement of Marguerite Breanne Finley.” During the divorce proceeding, the\n\ntrial court admitted exhibit two into evidence. Having no reason to believe that\n\nthe trial court based the division of community property on any other values, we\n\nconclude that the trial court based its division on the values shown on exhibit two\n\nthat was admitted during the trial.\n\n      Finley further argues that the trial court was “mistaken in admitting the\n\nPetitioner’s Sworn Inventory & Appraisement pursuant to Parker” and therefore\n\nerred by dividing the community property based on Lilley’s inventory and\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fappraisement because those values did not reflect the values on the date of the\n\ndivorce.\n\n      The value of community assets is generally determined as of the date of\n\ndivorce or as close to that date as possible.

However, we have held that\n\nthe facts of a particular case may necessitate some other basis for the property\n\ndivision and that this decision should be left to the discretion of the trial judge to\n\navoid the inequities that could result by establishing a bright-line rule.       See\n\nParker, 897 S.W.2d at 932. Whichever approach we take, the cases that discuss\n\nthe proper date of valuation discuss it in the context of the choice being between\n\nthe date of the divorce and the date on which the property is subsequently\n\ndivided when these events occur on different dates. See, e.g., Grossnickle v.\n\nGrossnickle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365489\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365489/grossnickle-v-grossnickle/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836–37 (Tex.

Finley nonetheless argues\n\nthat the trial court should have used values that were ascertained closer to the\n\ndate of the final trial on November 30, 2010, rather than those that Lilley\n\nsubmitted on February 17, 2010.        Even under the stricter general rule, the\n\nrequirement is that trial courts must use a value that was determined as close to\n\n\n                                         27\n\fthe date of divorce as possible. Quijano, 347 S.W.3d at 350. Here, the trial court\n\nordered both parties to submit a sworn inventory and appraisement of all\n\nseparate and community property, but only Lilley submitted an inventory to the\n\ntrial court.   Lilley’s inventory and appraisement was thus the best evidence\n\npresented to the trial court regarding the value of the parties’ property. See id.\n\nThe trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion by dividing the property\n\nbased on the most recent values that the trial court had before it.        See id.\n\n(holding that using values from six-month-old bank statement did not render\n\nevidence insufficient to support trial court’s assessment of value in checking\n\naccount and did not render trial court’s division of property manifestly unjust and\n\nunfair because appellant did not appear and present his own evidence).\n\n                   C. Division Based on Personality Factors\n\n       Finley additionally argues that “to the extent that the division of personal\n\nproperty was based on a lack of courtroom decorum which is alleged to have\n\noccurred in another location, the trial court should not have based a division of\n\nmarital property on personality factors” because Lilley “did not plead for a just\n\nand right division based on ‘erratic behavior in court.’” Finley appears to tie his\n\nargument to the trial court’s order requiring him to pay the entire amount of\n\nattorney’s fees.   We have reviewed the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees\n\nabove and have found no abuse of discretion.\n\n       Having decided against Finley on each of his arguments pertaining to the\n\nproperty division, we therefore overrule Finley’s fifth issue.\n\n\n                                          28\n\f                             VIII. MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL\n\n      In his sixth issue, Finley appears to argue that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying his motion for new trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(f), 38.9\n\n(directing appellate courts to liberally construe briefs and address every issue\n\nfairly included within a point presented for review).       Finley contends that his\n\nfailure to appear at the final trial on the petition for divorce was due to a mistake.\n\n      A default judgment should be set aside and a new trial granted when the\n\ndefaulting party establishes that (1) the failure to appear was not intentional or\n\nthe result of conscious indifference but was the result of an accident or mistake,\n\n(2) the motion for new trial sets up a meritorious defense, and (3) granting the\n\nmotion will occasion no delay or otherwise injure the plaintiff.

When a defaulting\n\nparty moving for a new trial meets all three elements of the Craddock test, then a\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion if it fails to grant a new trial.13 Lerma, 288 S.W.3d\n\nat 926.\n\n      With regard to the first prong of the Craddock test, Finley’s motion for new\n\ntrial stated only the following:\n\n      A new trial should be granted to Movant because this Court abused\n      its discretion [by] permitting the withdrawal of counsel for\n      Respondent on November 17, 2010[,] without allowing time for\n\n      13\n      The Craddock test applies to no-answer and post-answer default\njudgments.

See Dir., State Emps. Workers’ Comp. Div.\n\nv.

Because Finley failed to satisfy the\n\nfirst prong of Craddock, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\noverruling Finley’s motion for new trial. See Lerma, 288 S.W.3d at 926. We\n\ntherefore overrule the portion of Finley’s sixth issue related to the denial of his\n\nmotion for new trial.\n\n      Finley also argues within his sixth issue that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by failing to rule on his motion for continuance.14 Assuming, without\n\ndeciding, that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on his motion\n\nfor continuance, Finley failed to show how he was harmed. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.1(a). Although Finley argues that the trial court’s failure to rule on his motion\n\nfor continuance caused him to mistakenly believe that his motion had been\n\ngranted and that the trial date had been continued, he does not cite any authority\n\n      14\n         Although we find no express ruling denying the motion for continuance,\nthe trial court’s act of proceeding with the trial and rendering judgment against\nFinley in the face of his pending motion for continuance constitutes an implicit\ndenial of his motion for purposes of our review of this complaint. See Tex. R.\nApp. P. 33.1(a)(2)(A); Carter v.

(not designated for publication)\n\n(holding that trial court’s failure to rule on a motion for continuance, even if\n\nimproper, caused no harm and that trial court implicitly denied the motion by\n\nholding the hearing that appellant had requested to be postponed). Moreover,\n\nFinley did not verify his motion for continuance or support it with an affidavit. See\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 251 (requiring motion for continuance to be supported by\n\naffidavit). If a motion for continuance is not verified or supported by affidavit, we\n\nwill presume that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion\n\nfor continuance. See Moreno v. Silva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1873933\"><a href=\"/opinion/1873933/moreno-v-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (Tex.

See id.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule the portion of Finley’s sixth issue related to his motion\n\nfor continuance.\n\n       Finley further argues in his sixth issue that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing his trial counsel to withdraw and providing a deadline after\n\nthe trial date for his trial counsel to forward Finley his file. When a trial court\n\nallows an attorney to voluntarily withdraw, it must give the party time to secure\n\nnew counsel and time for the new counsel to investigate the case and prepare for\n\ntrial. See Villegas v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1499729\"><a href=\"/opinion/1499729/villegas-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626–27 (Tex. 1986); Moreno, 316\n\n\n                                          31\n\fS.W.3d at 818.     Here, Finley had almost two weeks to secure new counsel.\n\nFinley does not argue that this was not enough time to obtain an attorney or for\n\nan attorney to prepare for trial, nor does he argue or point to anything in the\n\nrecord to demonstrate that he had tried to hire a new attorney.15 See Moreno,\n\n316 S.W.3d at 818 (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, in\n\npart, because nothing in the record showed that the appellant had tried to hire an\n\nattorney after his attorney withdrew). We therefore hold that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion by granting Finley’s attorney’s motion to withdraw.16 See id.\n\nWe therefore overrule the remainder of Finley’s sixth issue.\n\n                                 IX. CONCLUSION\n\n      Having sustained Finley’s fourth issue, we dissolve the trial court’s\n\npermanent injunction and modify the final decree to omit any reference to the\n\npermanent injunction. Having overruled Finley’s second, third, fifth, and sixth\n\nissues, we affirm the granting of the divorce and the remainder of the final decree\n\n\n      15\n        The only specific error of which Finley complains is that the trial court’s\norder gave Finley’s trial attorney fifteen days to forward trial documents to Finley\nwhen only thirteen days remained before trial. Even if this constituted an abuse\nof discretion, Finley does not argue that his trial attorney waited fifteen days or\nany length of time to deliver the documents. Finley therefore has not shown any\nreversible error by the trial court. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a).\n      16\n          To the extent that Finley argues in one sentence that he was denied due\nprocess because his attorney was allowed to withdraw, he did not raise this issue\nin the trial court and therefore did not preserve this issue for review.
