Hodges, — U.S. —, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2605 (2015). The court of appeals\n\nthen reversed the temporary injunction and remanded the case to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n       Petitioners Jack Pidgeon and Larry Hicks contend that the court’s opinion and judgment\n\nimpose—or at least can be read to impose—greater restrictions on remand than Obergefell and\n\nthis Court’s precedent require. We agree. We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment, vacate the\n\ftrial court’s orders, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nour opinion and judgment.\n\n                                               I.\n                                           Background\n\n       The “annals of human history reveal the transcendent importance of marriage.” Obergefell,\n\n135 S. Ct. at 2593–94. “Since the dawn of history, marriage has transformed strangers into\n\nrelatives, binding families and societies together.” Id. at 2594. For thousands of years, both the\n\nrole of marriage and its importance to society were founded on the “understanding that marriage\n\nis a union between two persons of the opposite sex.” Id. Until only recently, “marriage between a\n\nman and a woman no doubt had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition\n\nof that term and to its role and function throughout the history of civilization.” United States v.\n\nWindsor, — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2689 (2013).\n\n       While “most people” have shared that view, others have not. In the early 1970s, for\n\nexample, two men obtained a Texas marriage license when one of them appeared before the county\n\nclerk dressed as a woman. See James W. Harper & George M. Clifton, Comment, Heterosexuality;\n\nA Prerequisite to Marriage in Texas?, 14 S. TEX. L.J. 220, 220 (1972–73). In response, the Texas\n\nLegislature amended the Texas Family Code to expressly provide that a marriage license “may not\n\nbe issued for the marriage of persons of the same sex.” See Act of June 15, 1973, 63rd Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 577, § 1, 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1596, 1596–97 (amending former Texas Family Code section\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f1.01). Texas thus became the second state in the Union1 to adopt what is often referred to as a\n\n“defense of marriage act” (DOMA).2\n\n         In response to early lawsuits, courts throughout the United States consistently rejected legal\n\nchallenges to the historical understanding of marriage.3 Beginning in the 1990s, many other states\n\nand the federal government4 enacted DOMAs to amend their statutes5—and in some states, their\n\nconstitutions6—to preserve the traditional view of marriage. Around the same time, however, other\n\n\n        1\n          A few weeks earlier in 1973, Maryland adopted a statute providing that “[o]nly a marriage between a man\nand a woman is valid in this state.” See 1973 Md. Laws 574 (enacting former MD. CODE art. 62, § 1 (1973)).\n         2\n            For simplicity’s sake, we use the acronym DOMA to refer generically to legislation intended to limit\nmarriage to one man and one woman or otherwise defend or promote that historical view. In actuality, the laws we\nrefer to as DOMAs include a variety of provisions and address the subject in different ways.\n          3\n            See, e.g., Adams v. Howerton, 673 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding federal statute limited marriage to\none man and one woman and did not violate federal constitution); Dean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307 (D.C.\n1995) (holding D.C. statute did not authorize same-sex marriage and did not violate federal constitution); Jones v.\nHallahan, 501 S.W.2d 588, 590 (Ky. 1973) (holding state statute limited marriage to “the union of a man and a\nwoman” and did not violate federal constitution); Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 187 (Minn. 1971) (holding state\nstatute limited marriage to two persons of the opposite sex and did not violate federal constitution), appeal dism’d,\n409 U.S. 810, 810 (1972) (dismissing appeal “for want of a substantial federal question”); Anonymous v. Anonymous,\n325 N.Y.S.2d 499, 500 (1971) (“The law makes no provision for a ‘marriage’ between persons of the same sex.”).\n          4\n            Congress passed the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, and then-President Clinton signed it into law.\nSee Pub. L. No. 104-199, Sept. 21, 1996, 110 Stat. 2419. The federal DOMA had two key sections. First, it provided\nthat no state “shall be required to give effect to” any other state’s legal recognition of “a relationship between persons\nof the same sex that is treated as a marriage” or “a right or claim arising from such relationship.” Id. § 2(a) (codified\nat 28 U.S.C. § 1738C (1996)). Second, it provided that when used in any federal law, “the word ‘marriage’ means\nonly a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a\nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” Id. § 3(a) (codified at 1 U.S.C. § 7 (1996)).\n         5\n           See, e.g., ALA.

I, § 25; ARIZ. CONST. art. XXX, § 1; ARK. CONST. amend. LXXXIII, § 1; CAL.\n\n                                                            3\n\fstates’ courts became more receptive to legal and constitutional challenges to laws restricting\n\nmarriage to the historical view.7 Soon, some state legislatures began amending their laws to\n\nexpressly permit and recognize same-sex marriages, and more courts began invalidating laws that\n\ndid not.8\n\n         In 2013, the United States Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision that the federal DOMA’s\n\nprovision defining the terms “marriage” and “spouse” to apply only to opposite-sex couples\n\nviolates “basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government.”\n\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 (citing U.S. CONST. amend. V; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497\n\n(1954)). The Court noted that by then, twelve states and the District of Columbia had “decided that\n\nsame-sex couples should have the right to marry and so live with pride in themselves and their\n\nunion and in a status of equality with all other married persons.” Id. at 2689.\n\n\n\n\nCONST. art.

XV, § 5a; UTAH CONST. art. I, § 29; WIS. CONST. art. XIII, § 13.\n          7\n            See, e.g., Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 886 (Vt. 1999) (holding that the Vermont Constitution’s common-\nbenefits clause requires state to provide “the same benefits and protections” to same-sex couples as to “married\nopposite-sex couples”); Brause v. Bureau of Vital Statistics, No. 3AN-95-6562 CI, 1998 WL 88743, at *6 (Alaska\nSuper. Ct. Feb. 27, 1998) (mem. op.)

(holding Hawaii statute potentially violated Hawaii Constitution’s\nequal-protection clause and was subject to “strict scrutiny,” meaning it was unconstitutional unless it was “justified\nby compelling state interests” and was “narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgements of the [plaintiffs’]\nconstitutional rights”).\n         8\n           See, e.g., DEL. CODE tit. 13, § 129 (2013); D.C. CODE § 46-401 (2009); MD. CODE, FAM. LAW § 2-201\n(2012); MINN. STAT. § 517.01 (2013); N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. § 457:1-a (2009); N.Y. DOM. REL.

Health, 957 A.2d 407 (Conn. 2008);\nLewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006); Goodridge v. Dept. of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).\n\n                                                           4\n\f           In the Court’s view, the federal DOMA definitions did not merely preserve the traditional\n\nview of marriage. Instead, their “avowed purpose and practical effect [were] to impose a\n\ndisadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made\n\nlawful by the unquestioned authority of [the] States.” Id. at 2693. Concluding that “no legitimate\n\npurpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom [a state], by its\n\nmarriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity,” the Court found the federal\n\ndefinitions unconstitutional. Id. at 2696.\n\n           Based on Windsor, the City of Houston city attorney advised then-Mayor Annise Parker\n\nthat the City “may extend benefits” to City employees’ same-sex spouses who were legally married\n\nin other states “on the same terms it extends benefits to heterosexual spouses.” In the attorney’s\n\nopinion, refusing to provide such benefits would “be unconstitutional.” Relying on this advice, on\n\nNovember 19, 2013, Mayor Parker sent a memo to the City’s human-resources director “directing\n\nthat same-sex spouses of employees who have been legally married in another jurisdiction be\n\nafforded the same benefits as spouses of a heterosexual marriage.” The City began offering those\n\nbenefits soon after the Mayor issued her directive.\n\n           A month later, on December 13, 2013, Pidgeon and Hicks9 filed suit against the City and\n\nthe Mayor10 in state court (Pidgeon I), challenging the Mayor’s directive and the City’s provision\n\n\n\n           9\n               Except when helpful to distinguish the two, we will generally refer to Pidgeon and Hicks collectively as\nPidgeon.\n           10\n            Except when helpful to distinguish the two, we will generally refer to the Mayor and the City collectively\nas the Mayor. Pidgeon sued Mayor Parker in her official capacity, as is required for an ultra-vires action. See City of\nEl Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 373 (Tex. 2009). Mayor Parker’s term ended on January 2, 2016, and Sylvester\nTurner took office on that date. When a public officer who is sued in an official capacity ceases to hold office before\nan appeal is resolved, her successor in office is automatically substituted as a party. TEX. R. APP. P. 7.2(a). Although\nMayor Turner did not initially issue the directive, he has expressed no intent to withdraw it and has continued to\ndefend it in this appeal.\n\n                                                             5\n\fof benefits pursuant to that directive. The Mayor removed Pidgeon I to federal court, which\n\nultimately remanded it back to state court. But by then, the state court had apparently dismissed\n\nthe suit for want of prosecution. Instead of challenging the dismissal of Pidgeon I, Pidgeon and\n\nHicks reasserted their claims by filing this suit (Pidgeon II) on October 22, 2014.\n\n        Pidgeon and Hicks alleged that they are Houston taxpayers and qualified voters, that the\n\nCity is “expending significant public funds on an illegal activity,” and that the Mayor’s directive\n\nauthorizing those expenditures violates Texas’s and the City’s DOMAs. Specifically, prior to\n\nWindsor, the City had amended its charter, and the State had amended the Texas Family Code and\n\nthe Texas Constitution, to more forcefully preserve the traditional view of marriage:\n\n        x       In 2001, the City’s voters signed and then approved a petition to amend the City’s\n                charter to provide that, except “as required by State or Federal law, the City of\n                Houston shall not provide employment benefits, including health care, to persons\n                other than employees, their legal spouses and dependent children.” CITY OF\n                HOUSTON CHARTER art. II, § 22. Although this language did not expressly refer to\n                same-sex relationships, the voters’ intent to deny tax-funded employment benefits\n                to same-sex partners was undisputed, as reflected in the title the City itself gave to\n                the new provision: “Denial of Benefits to Same-Sex Partners and Related\n                Matters.”11\n\n        x       In 2003, the Texas Legislature amended the Family Code to expressly provide that\n                (1) any “marriage between persons of the same sex . . . is contrary to the public\n                policy of this state and is void in this state”; and (2) the state or any agency or\n                political subdivision “may not give effect to” any “right or claim to any legal\n                protection, benefit, or responsibility asserted as a result of a marriage between\n                persons of the same sex . . . in this state or in any other jurisdiction,” TEX. FAM.\n                CODE § 6.204(b), (c)(2) (2003). See Act of May 14, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 124,\n                § 1, 2003 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. 124.\n\n        x       In 2005, two-thirds of the Texas Senate and House approved a joint resolution to\n                amend the Texas Constitution to expressly provide that:\n\n        11\n               See also “City Voters Reject Same-Sex Benefits,” HOUS.

I, § 32.\n\n         Pidgeon alleged that these DOMAs remained valid and enforceable despite Windsor\n\nbecause Windsor addressed only the federal DOMA and its impact on persons married in states\n\nthat had elected to allow same-sex marriages. In Pidgeon’s view, Windsor merely required the\n\nfederal government to acknowledge marriages the various states may recognize; it did not require\n\nTexas or any other state to license same-sex marriages or recognize same-sex marriages performed\n\nin other states. Pidgeon sought unspecified actual damages as well as temporary and permanent\n\ninjunctive relief prohibiting the City from providing benefits to same-sex spouses of employees\n\nmarried in other jurisdictions.\n\n         The Mayor and City filed pleas to the jurisdiction asserting governmental immunity and\n\nchallenging Pidgeon’s standing to assert his claims.13 The trial court denied the pleas and granted\n\nPidgeon’s request for a temporary injunction prohibiting the Mayor “from furnishing benefits to\n\npersons who were married in other jurisdictions to City employees of the same sex.” The Mayor\n\nimmediately filed this interlocutory appeal challenging both the order denying the pleas to the\n\njurisdiction and the order granting the temporary injunction.\n\n\n       12\n          See OFFICE OF THE SEC’Y OF STATE, RACE SUMMARY REPORT: 2005 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\nELECTION (2005), http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist117_state.htm.\n         13\n            The City challenged Pidgeon’s standing to assert any of his claims against the City, but the Mayor initially\nchallenged only his standing to sue her for damages and attorney’s fees. She later filed a supplemental plea challenging\nall of Pidgeon’s claims. The trial court heard and ruled on all of the challenges together.\n\n                                                           7\n\f        Meanwhile, courts across the country were hearing other lawsuits challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of various state DOMAs. In Obergefell, the United States Supreme Court\n\nconsolidated and agreed to hear five of those cases, in which the plaintiffs alleged that their states’\n\nlaws denying same-sex couples the right to marry or prohibiting recognition of the legal validity\n\nof a same-sex marriage from another state violate the federal Constitution. 135 S. Ct. at 2593. On\n\nJune 26, 2015—while this case (Pidgeon II) remained pending on interlocutory appeal before the\n\nTexas court of appeals—the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Obergefell. Id. at\n\n2608.\n\n        In another 5-4 decision, the Court concluded in Obergefell that the state DOMAs at issue\n\nviolate “the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 2604.\n\nBased on that conclusion, the Court held that the states may not “exclude same-sex couples from\n\ncivil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples,” and may not “refuse to\n\nrecognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex\n\ncharacter.” Id. at 2605.\n\n        The Mayor then filed a supplemental brief in the court of appeals, arguing that Obergefell\n\nrequired the court to reverse the injunction. In response, Pidgeon argued that even if Obergefell\n\nrequires Texas to license and recognize same-sex marriages, it does not require “states to pay\n\ntaxpayer-funded benefits to same-sex relationships.” According to Pidgeon, Obergefell did not\n\nresolve his claims because federal courts cannot “commandeer state spending decisions.”\n\n        On July 28, 2015, the court of appeals reversed the trial court’s temporary injunction. 477\n\nS.W.3d 353, 355 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015). In a brief per curiam opinion, the court\n\nrecited Obergefell’s holdings that “same sex couples may exercise their fundamental right to marry\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fin all States,” and that “there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex\n\nmarriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.” Id. at 354 (quoting\n\nObergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2604–05, 2607–08). Noting “the substantial change in the law regarding\n\nsame-sex marriage since the temporary injunction was signed,” the court reversed the injunction\n\nand remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Id. at 355. We granted Pidgeon’s\n\npetition for review.14\n\n                                                     II.\n                                               Our Jurisdiction\n\n        We must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the court of appeals’\n\ninterlocutory decision. The Mayor appealed from the trial court’s orders denying her plea to the\n\njurisdiction and granting the temporary injunction. Texas law permits interlocutory appeals from\n\nsuch orders, see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 51.014(a)(4), (8), but currently, this Court’s\n\njurisdiction over interlocutory appeals “is limited.” TIC Energy & Chem., Inc. v. Martin, 498\n\nS.W.3d 68, 71 (Tex. 2016) (citing TEX. GOV’T CODE § 22.001(a)(1)).17 We may only review the\n\nappellate court’s interlocutory decision if (1) one or more justices dissented in the court of appeals,\n\n\n\n        14\n           Both before and after we granted review, we received numerous amicus curiae briefs urging us to consider\nthe case and expressing various views on how we should rule. In support of Pidgeon, we received amicus briefs from\none Texas Railroad Commissioner, eleven Texas Senators, forty Texas Representatives, and four then-candidates for\nthe Texas Legislature; fifteen “Conservative Leaders throughout Texas,” the U.S. Pastor Council, and Texas\nLeadership (aka the Texas Pastor Council); the Texas Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General; and the\nFoundation for Moral Law and the Institute for Creation Research. In support of the Mayor, we received amicus briefs\nfrom Kenneth L. Smith; the International Municipal Lawyers Association and the Texas Municipal League; Lawyers\nfor America; twenty-six Texas constitutional-law and family-law professors; L.J. and M.P., a Married Couple, and\nEquality Texas; the De Leon plaintiffs; the Anti-Defamation League; GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, Lambda\nLegal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the American Civil Liberties\nUnion of Texas, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation; and three “scholars who study same-sex couples\nand their families.” We also received numerous emails, letters, and postcards expressing a wide variety of views,\nwhich we have treated as amicus briefs.\n        17\n            The Legislature recently removed these and other limitations on our jurisdiction, but that change is not\neffective until September 1, 2017. Act of May 19, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., ch. ___, § 1, 2017 Tex. Gen. Laws ___, ___.\n\n                                                         9\n\for (2) the court of appeals “holds differently from a prior decision of another court of appeals or\n\nof the supreme court.” TEX. GOV’T CODE § 22.225(c) (incorporating TEX. GOV’T\n\nCODE § 22.001(a)(1)–(2)). One court “holds differently from another when there is inconsistency\n\nin their respective decisions that should be clarified to remove unnecessary uncertainty in the law\n\nand unfairness to litigants.” Id. § 22.225(e).\n\n       Pidgeon argues that the court of appeals’ decision in this case creates an inconsistency that\n\nshould be clarified. In its opinion, the court recited not only the Supreme Court’s holdings in\n\nObergefell, but also the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ holdings in a case called De\n\nLeon v. Abbott. See 477 S.W.3d at 354–55 (citing De Leon v. Abbott, 791 F.3d 619, 624–25 (5th\n\nCir. 2015)). Concluding that both decisions created a “substantial change in the law regarding\n\nsame-sex marriage since the temporary injunction was signed,” the court reversed the temporary\n\ninjunction and remanded the case to the trial court “for proceedings consistent with Obergefell and\n\nDe Leon.” Id. at 355. Pidgeon contends that the court’s requirement that the trial court proceed\n\n“consistent with” De Leon conflicts with our previous decisions holding that Fifth Circuit decisions\n\nare not binding on Texas courts. See, e.g., Penrod Drilling Corp. v. Williams, 868 S.W.2d 294,\n\n296 (Tex. 1993) (holding that while “Texas courts may certainly draw upon the precedents of the\n\nFifth Circuit, or any other federal or state court, . . . they are obligated to follow only higher Texas\n\ncourts and the United States Supreme Court”).\n\n       The Mayor agrees that De Leon is not binding on the trial court but contends that the court\n\nof appeals did not hold that it was. According to the Mayor, the court of appeals “did not rule on\n\nhow Obergefell and De Leon affect the ultimate outcome of [Pidgeon’s] claims,” and instead\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f“simply reversed the temporary injunction based on the change in the law and remanded to the\n\ntrial court, in the interest of justice, for proceedings consistent with those cases.”\n\n        We agree with the Mayor that the trial court could read the court of appeals’ opinion to\n\nhold merely that the trial court should consider De Leon as a persuasive authority when addressing\n\nPidgeon’s arguments. As the Mayor notes, the court of appeals suggested that it was remanding\n\nthe case “in the interest of justice” because the case “has not been fully developed.” 477 S.W.3d\n\nat 355 n.3 (citing TEX. R. APP. P. 43.3(b); Ahmed v. Ahmed, 261 S.W.3d 190, 196 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.); Chrismon v. Brown, 246 S.W.3d 102, 116 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.)). But without our review, Pidgeon has no assurance that the\n\ntrial court would read the court of appeals’ opinion that way. The court of appeals did not instruct\n\nthe trial court to proceed “in light of” or “considering” De Leon. Instead, it instructed the court to\n\nproceed “consistent with” De Leon. We conclude that the court of appeals’ language gives rise to\n\nthe type of “unnecessary uncertainty in the law and unfairness to litigants” that our conflicts\n\njurisdiction allows us to clarify. See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 22.225(e). We thus conclude that we have\n\njurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. See Harry Eldridge Co. v. T.S. Lankford & Sons, Inc.,\n\n371 S.W.2d 878, 879 (Tex. 1963) (“[W]hen our jurisdiction is properly invoked as to one point set\n\nforth in the application for writ of error, we acquire jurisdiction of the entire case.”).\n\n                                             III.\n                                 Arguments and Requested Relief\n\n        We now turn to Pidgeon’s substantive arguments. Pidgeon does not argue that the court of\n\nappeals erred by dissolving the temporary injunction and remanding the case to the trial court.\n\nInstead, he contends that the court of appeals (A) should not have instructed the trial court to\n\nconduct further proceedings “consistent with” De Leon; (B) should not have reversed the\n\n                                                  11\n\ftemporary injunction, but instead should have vacated or dissolved it; and (C) should have affirmed\n\nthe temporary injunction “to the extent” it required the City to “claw back” benefits the City\n\nprovided to same-sex spouses before Obergefell. In addition, he (D) urges us to instruct the trial\n\ncourt to “narrowly construe” Obergefell on remand. We address each argument in turn.\n\nA      De Leon\n\n       Pidgeon first argues that by instructing the trial court to conduct further proceedings\n\n“consistent with” the Fifth Circuit’s decision in De Leon, the court of appeals’ opinion could be\n\nmisread to mean that De Leon is binding on the trial court. Whether De Leon is binding is crucial\n\nto Pidgeon’s case because unlike Obergefell, De Leon specifically held that the Texas DOMAs\n\nviolate the federal Constitution and cannot be enforced. See De Leon v. Perry, 975 F. Supp. 2d\n\n632, 666 (W.D. Tex. 2014), aff’d sub nom., De Leon v. Abbott, 791 F.3d 619 (5th Cir. 2015). We\n\nagree with Pidgeon that the court of appeals should not have ordered the trial court to proceed on\n\nremand “consistent with” De Leon.\n\n       Two same-sex couples filed De Leon in federal court in San Antonio in 2013, shortly after\n\nWindsor issued. They sued the Texas Governor, the Texas Commissioner of the Department of\n\nState Health Services, and the Bexar County Clerk (collectively, the Governor), challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of the Texas DOMAs under the federal Constitution. The federal district court\n\nenjoined the Governor from enforcing the Texas DOMAs, holding that “Texas’ prohibition on\n\nsame-sex marriage conflicts with the United States Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection\n\nand due process,” 975 F. Supp. 2d at 639, and “Texas’ refusal to recognize . . . out-of-state same-\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fsex marriage[s] violates due process,” id. at 662. The Governor15 promptly appealed the injunction\n\nto the Fifth Circuit, where it remained pending until the Supreme Court decided Obergefell.\n\n         After the Supreme Court announced its decision in Obergefell, the Governor agreed with\n\nthe De Leon plaintiffs that the federal-court injunction was “correct in light of Obergefell.” Id. at\n\n625. The Fifth Circuit thus affirmed the injunction and remanded the case with instructions that\n\nthe district court enter a final judgment on the merits in the plaintiffs’ favor. Id. The Governor did\n\nnot oppose this disposition or seek the Supreme Court’s review. On July 7, 2015, the district court\n\nentered a final judgment declaring that the Texas DOMAs violate the federal Constitution’s due-\n\nprocess and equal-protection clauses and permanently enjoining the Governor “from enforcing\n\nTexas’s laws prohibiting same-sex marriage.” The parties agree that the State of Texas has been\n\nproviding benefits to state employees’ same-sex spouses ever since.\n\n         We agree with Pidgeon that De Leon does not bind the trial court in this case and the court\n\nof appeals should not have instructed the trial court to conduct further proceedings “consistent\n\nwith” De Leon. Penrod Drilling, 868 S.W.2d at 296.16 That does not mean, however, that the trial\n\n\n\n\n         15\n          Rick Perry was the Texas Governor when De Leon was filed in 2013. By the time Obergefell issued in\n2015, Greg Abbott was the Governor, having taken office in January of that year. Governor Abbott previously served\nas Texas Attorney General, and in that capacity, he represented Governor Perry in De Leon. When Abbott became\nGovernor, Ken Paxton became Attorney General and began representing now-Governor Abbott in De Leon.\n         16\n             See also Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 376 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“In our federal system,\na state trial court’s interpretation of federal law is no less authoritative than that of the federal court of appeals in\nwhose circuit the trial court is located.”), cited by Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 58 n.11\n(1997); U. S. ex rel. Lawrence v. Woods, 432 F.2d 1072, 1076 (7th Cir. 1970) (“[B]ecause lower federal courts exercise\nno appellate jurisdiction over state tribunals, decisions of lower federal courts are not conclusive on state courts.”).\nTexas courts of appeals have also consistently recognized this principle. See, e.g., First Nat’l Collection Bureau, Inc.\nv. Walker, 348 S.W.3d 329, 337 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied) (“Although decisions of the federal courts of\nappeals do not bind Texas courts, [state courts] receive them ‘with respectful consideration.’”) (quoting Hassan v.\nGreater Hous. Transp. Co., 237 S.W.3d 727, 731 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied)); Barstow v.\nState, 742 S.W.2d 495, 501–02 (Tex. App.—Austin 1987, writ denied) (“We are not bound to follow [Fifth Circuit\nprecedent] merely because Texas lies within the geographical limits of the Fifth Circuit.”).\n\n                                                          13\n\fcourt should not consider De Leon when resolving Pidgeon’s claims. Fifth Circuit decisions,\n\nparticularly those regarding federal constitutional questions, can certainly be helpful and may be\n\npersuasive for Texas trial courts. Moreover, De Leon could potentially affect the relief the trial\n\ncourt might provide on remand, since De Leon has enjoined the Governor from enforcing the Texas\n\nDOMAs and the State of Texas is thus providing benefits to state employees’ same-sex spouses.\n\nThe trial court should certainly proceed on remand “in light of” De Leon, but it is not required to\n\nproceed “consistent with” it.\n\nB.     “Reversal” of the injunction\n\n       Pidgeon next argues that by “reversing” the trial court’s temporary injunction instead of\n\nvacating or dissolving it, the court of appeals’ judgment might be taken to have a res-judicata\n\neffect prohibiting Pidgeon from seeking or obtaining the same or similar relief on remand. The\n\nMayor contends, however, that the court of appeals could not have erred by reversing the\n\ninjunction order because our rules only permit a court of appeals to “reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment and remand the case for further proceedings.” TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(d) (emphasis added);\n\ncompare TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(e) (permitting courts of appeals to “vacate the trial court’s judgment\n\nand dismiss the case” (emphases added)) with 60.2(f) (permitting this Court to “vacate the lower\n\ncourt’s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings in light of changes in the law”\n\n(emphases added)); but see TEX. R. APP. P. 43.6 (“The court of appeals may make any other\n\nappropriate order that the law and the nature of the case require.”).\n\n       Texas appellate courts have held that the “dissolution of a temporary injunction bars a\n\nsecond application for such injunctive relief.” See Sonwalkar v. St. Luke’s Sugar Land P’ship, 394\n\nS.W.3d 186, 195 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.); see also City of San Antonio v.\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fSingleton, 858 S.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. 1993) (stating that the trial court’s jurisdiction to “review,\n\nopen, vacate or modify” an injunction based on changed conditions “must be balanced against\n\nprinciples of res judicata”). But that is not true if “the second request is based on changed\n\ncircumstances not known by the applicant at the time of the first application.” Sonwalkar, 394\n\nS.W.3d at 195 (citing State v. Ruiz Wholesale Co., 901 S.W.2d 772, 776 (Tex. App.—Austin 1995,\n\nno writ)). When conditions have changed, including a change in the law, the trial court may\n\nconsider the injunction anew in light of the new law or circumstances. See Smith v. O’Neill, 813\n\nS.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex. 1991) (per curiam) (citing City of Tyler v. St. Louis Sw. Ry., 405 S.W.2d\n\n330, 332 (Tex. 1966)); Sonwalkar, 394 S.W.3d at 195.\n\n       Obergefell undoubtedly constitutes a “change in the law” that justified the dissolution of\n\nthe trial court’s injunction in this case. But in light of that change in the law, Pidgeon is not\n\nprecluded from seeking the same or similar relief on remand. On remand, the trial court must\n\nconsider both parties’ arguments regarding the effect of Obergefell on Pidgeon’s claims, and may\n\ngrant whatever relief is then appropriate.\n\nC.     “Claw-back” Relief\n\n       Pidgeon next argues that the court of appeals should have affirmed the temporary\n\ninjunction “to the extent” the injunction required the City to “claw back” tax dollars it expended\n\non benefits for same-sex spouses prior to Obergefell. Pidgeon reasons that Obergefell does not\n\napply retroactively to authorize pre-Obergefell expenditures because the Supreme Court\n\nacknowledged that it was attributing a new meaning to the Fourteenth Amendment based on “new\n\ninsights and societal understandings.” Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2603. According to Pidgeon,\n\nSupreme Court decisions apply retroactively when the Court determines and enforces the\n\n\n                                                15\n\fConstitution’s original meaning, see Harper v. Va. Dept. of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 106–07 (1993)\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring), but not when it changes the Constitution’s meaning as it did in\n\nObergefell.17 And since Obergefell is not retroactive, the Texas DOMAs remained fully in effect\n\nat least until June 26, 2015, and the Mayor had no authority to issue or enforce the directive before\n\nthen.\n\n         In response, the Mayor contends that Pidgeon lacks standing to seek any retroactive relief.\n\nThe Mayor argues that although Pidgeon—as a City taxpayer—may have standing to complain\n\nabout the City’s future illegal expenditures of public funds, taxpayers only have standing to seek\n\nretrospective relief against illegal expenditures if they can demonstrate a particularized injury. See\n\nWilliams v. Lara, 52 S.W.3d 171, 179 (Tex. 2001).\n\n         Relying on Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., — U.S. —, 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014)—a\n\nchallenge to federal health-insurance regulations under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration\n\nAct, id. at 2759—Pidgeon replies that he and Hicks have in fact suffered a particularized injury\n\n“because they are devout Christians who have been compelled by the mayor’s unlawful edict to\n\nsubsidize homosexual relationships that they regard as immoral and sinful.” The Mayor, in turn,\n\ndenies that Hobby Lobby grants Pidgeon standing under these circumstances, and contends that—\n\neven if Pidgeon had standing to seek retroactive monetary relief—he would not have standing to\n\n\n\n\n         17\n             Pidgeon also argues that Obergefell cannot apply retroactively because otherwise (1) same-sex couples\nwho lived together and held themselves out as “married” in jurisdictions that recognize common-law marriage would\nin fact be retroactively married; (2) any such couples who since ended their relationships and entered into new\nrelationships could be retroactively liable for alimony to the former “spouses” and subject to bigamy prosecutions;\nand (3) jurisdictions around the country will be liable for damages to every same-sex couple that was denied a marriage\nlicense or recognition prior to Obergefell. We express no opinions on these hypotheticals at this time, as they are\nunnecessary to our resolution of this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                         16\n\fforce the City to recover funds it previously paid to third parties. See Hoffman v. Davis, 100 S.W.2d\n\n94, 96 (Tex. 1937) (holding that when a taxing entity has already spent a taxpayer’s tax money,\n\n“an action for its recovery is for the [taxing entity],” and the “cause of action belongs to it alone”);\n\nsee also Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 556 (Tex. 2000) (quoting Hoffman with\n\napproval).\n\n       We find these arguments both interesting and important, but at least two obstacles prevent\n\nus from reaching them today. First, Pidgeon never requested an injunction requiring the City to\n\nclaw back benefits it provided before Obergefell; and second, the trial court never granted one.\n\nThe temporary injunction at issue here prospectively prohibited the City “from furnishing benefits\n\nto persons who were married in other jurisdictions to City employees of the same sex.” The order\n\ndid not to any extent require the City to recover benefits it had previously paid. It was a temporary\n\ninjunction, and its only “proper function” was to “preserve the status quo.” Coyote Lake Ranch v.\n\nCity of Lubbock, 498 S.W.3d 53, 65 (Tex. 2016). We cannot conclude that the court of appeals\n\nerred by failing to preserve the injunction “to the extent” that it required a claw-back when it did\n\nnot require a claw-back to any extent.\n\n        Because Pidgeon has never yet sought a claw-back injunction, we express no opinion on\n\nwhether he has standing to seek one or whether he is entitled to one. We agree with Pidgeon,\n\nhowever, that the court of appeals’ opinion and judgment do not prohibit him from seeking such\n\nan injunction or any other relief on remand. But we conclude that the court of appeals did not err\n\nby reversing this temporary injunction in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fD.     Instructions on Remand\n\n       Finally, Pidgeon urges us to instruct the trial court to “narrowly construe” Obergefell on\n\nremand and to “comply with Obergefell but not to expand on it,” so as to “preserve as much of the\n\n[Texas DOMAs] as possible.” Pidgeon argues that we should provide these instructions because\n\nObergefell is “poorly reasoned,” has “no basis in the text or history of the Constitution,” and does\n\nnot “faithfully interpret” the Constitution. So construed, Obergefell may have recognized a\n\n“fundamental right” to same-sex marriage and may “require States to license and recognize same-\n\nsex marriages,” but, Pidgeon contends, it did not recognize a fundamental right “to spousal\n\nemployee benefits” or “require States to give taxpayer subsidies to same-sex couples.” Pidgeon\n\nargues that we should “remand for a new temporary injunction hearing” and the trial court should\n\n“consider on remand which applications of [the Texas DOMAs] can be preserved to the extent\n\nthey prohibit taxpayer subsidies for same-sex marriages.”\n\n       The Mayor agrees we should remand this case to the trial court, but contends that\n\nObergefell, and Windsor before it, held that the Constitution protects not only the right of same-\n\nsex couples to marry, but also to receive all of the “benefits” of marriage. See, e.g., Obergefell,\n\n135 S. Ct. at 2606 (declining to adopt a “slower, case-by-case determination of the required\n\navailability of specific public benefits to same-sex couples”); Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694\n\n(observing that the federal DOMA prevents “same-sex married couples from obtaining\n\ngovernment healthcare benefits they would otherwise receive”). The Mayor also contends that\n\nPidgeon lacks standing to challenge the Mayor’s directive under Obergefell, and rejects Pidgeon’s\n\nposition that Texas courts can “narrowly construe” Obergefell, at least to the extent that means\n\nthey can ignore its natural meaning and applications. See, e.g., McKinney v. Blankenship, 282\n\n\n                                                18\n\fS.W.2d 691, 694–95 (Tex. 1955) (rejecting argument that Texas courts could ignore Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education since Texas’s segregation laws “were not before the Supreme Court” in that\n\ncase as “so utterly without merit that we overrule it without further discussion”).\n\n         We agree with the Mayor that any effort to resolve whether and the extent to which the\n\nConstitution requires states or cities to provide tax-funded benefits to same-sex couples without\n\nconsidering Obergefell would simply be erroneous.18 On the other hand, we agree with Pidgeon\n\nthat the Supreme Court did not address and resolve that specific issue in Obergefell. “Whatever\n\nramifications Obergefell may have for sexual relations beyond the approval of same-sex marriage\n\nare unstated at best . . . .” Coker v. Whittington, 858 F.3d 304, 307 (5th Cir. 2017).19 The Supreme\n\nCourt held in Obergefell that the Constitution requires states to license and recognize same-sex\n\nmarriages to the same extent that they license and recognize opposite-sex marriages, but it did not\n\nhold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons, and—unlike\n\nthe Fifth Circuit in De Leon—it did not hold that the Texas DOMAs are unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n         18\n            See, e.g., Pavan v. Smith, ___ U.S.___, 2017 WL 2722472, at *2 (2017) (per curiam) (holding that\n“Obergefell proscribes” the “disparate treatment” resulting from state statute that requires listing married woman’s\nhusband’s name on child’s birth certificate but permits state to omit married woman’s female spouse’s name); see also\nObergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2601 (stating that “same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States\nhave linked to marriage”), 2604 (stating that DOMAs “burden the liberty of same-sex couples” and deny “all the\nbenefits afforded opposite-sex couples”), 2626 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (inviting same-sex-marriage proponents to\ncelebrate “the availability of new benefits”); Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2692 (stating that the federal “DOMA rejects the\nlong-established precept that the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married couples\nwithin each State”), 2693 (stating that the federal DOMA “operates to deprive same-sex couples of the benefits and\nresponsibilities that come with the federal recognition of their marriages”).\n         19\n           See, e.g., Parella v. Johnson, No. 1:15-cv-0863, 2016 WL 3566861, at *9–10 (N.D.N.Y. June 27, 2016)\n(holding that even after Obergefell, the “fundamental right to marry” does not include “the right to obtain a visa for\nan alien spouse”); Solomon v. Guidry, 155 A.3d 1218, 1221 (Vt. 2016) (“[B]ecause civil marriage and civil unions\nremain legally distinct entities in Vermont and because Obergefell mandated that states recognize only same-\nsex marriage, uncertainty remains as to whether Obergefell requires other states to recognize and dissolve civil unions\nestablished in Vermont.”); In re P.L.L.-R., 876 N.W.2d 147, 153 (Wis. Ct. App. 2015) (“Obergefell did not answer\nquestions regarding Wisconsin’s presumption of paternity statute.”).\n\n                                                         19\n\f       Of course, that does not mean that the Texas DOMAs are constitutional or that the City\n\nmay constitutionally deny benefits to its employees’ same-sex spouses. Those are the issues that\n\nthis case now presents in light of Obergefell. We need not instruct to the trial court to “narrowly\n\nconstrue” Obergefell to confirm that Obergefell did not directly and expressly resolve those issues.\n\nBut neither will we instruct the trial court to construe Obergefell in any manner that makes it\n\nirrelevant to these issues. Pidgeon contends that neither the Constitution nor Obergefell requires\n\ncitizens to support same-sex marriages with their tax dollars, but he has not yet had the opportunity\n\nto make his case. And the Mayor has not yet had the opportunity to oppose it. Both are entitled to\n\na full and fair opportunity to litigate their positions on remand.\n\n       Although both parties agree that we should remand this case for the parties to have that full\n\nand fair opportunity, some amici have argued that we should resolve the parties’ dispute here on\n\nthis interlocutory appeal. We cannot resolve the parties’ claims now, however, because they have\n\nnot yet been fully developed or litigated. The parties’ arguments address the meaning and\n\nramifications of Obergefell, which was not announced until after the parties had filed their briefs\n\nin the court of appeals. Naturally, the parties did not raise their current arguments in the trial court\n\nor in the court of appeals, and neither court ruled on them. Many of the arguments—including\n\nthose addressing standing and retroactivity, for example—depend on an evidentiary record that the\n\nparties have not yet had the opportunity to develop. “Without an actual challenge . . . , without full\n\nbriefing from all parties . . . , and without complete vetting of the parties’ potential arguments in\n\nthe lower courts, we are ill-prepared to offer—and constitutionally prohibited from offering—an\n\nadvisory interpretation . . . that could have significant, lasting consequences.” Hegar v. Tex. Small\n\nTobacco Coal., 496 S.W.3d 778, 792 (Tex. 2016) (citing Brooks v. Northglen Ass’n, 141 S.W.3d\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f158, 164 (Tex. 2004)); see also Pub. Affairs Assocs. v. Rickover, 369 U.S. 111, 113 (1962) (“These\n\nare delicate problems; their solution is bound to have far-reaching import. Adjudication of such\n\nproblems, certainly . . . should rest on an adequate and full-bodied record. The record before us is\n\nwoefully lacking in these requirements.”). We decline the amici’s requests that we render a final\n\nruling on the merits before the parties have had a full opportunity to make their case.\n\n                                              IV.\n                                            Immunity\n\n       Finally, we address the Mayor’s and the City’s interlocutory appeals from the trial court’s\n\norders denying their pleas to the jurisdiction based on governmental immunity. Although the\n\nparties briefed this issue in the court of appeals, they did so before Obergefell, and the court did\n\nnot address the issue in its opinion or its judgment. The Mayor noted the issue but reserved briefing\n\nin this Court. We are hesitant to ignore the issue because governmental immunity implicates the\n\ncourts’ subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Pidgeon’s claims. See Engelman Irrig. Dist. v. Shield\n\nBros., — S.W.3d —, — (Tex. 2017). But neither party has briefed the issue since Obergefell,\n\nwhich may also affect the immunity defenses.\n\n       The parties agree, for example, that Pidgeon sued the Mayor in her official capacity for\n\nacting ultra vires, that is, “without legal authority.” City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366,\n\n372 (2009). Pidgeon alleges that the Mayor acted unlawfully and without authority by issuing and\n\nenforcing the directive because the Texas and Houston DOMAs prohibit the City from providing\n\nbenefits to employees’ same-sex spouses. Governmental immunity does not bar an ultra-vires\n\nclaim, but the parties disagree whether the Mayor’s directive remains unlawful and unauthorized\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fafter Obergefell.20 This disagreement may present the ultimate issue in this case, both on the merits\n\nand for purposes of determining whether the Mayor has acted ultra vires.\n\n        The trial court denied the Mayor’s plea, but it did so in 2014, prior to Obergefell. Whether\n\n(or the extent to which) Pidgeon alleges ultra-vires conduct even after Obergefell is an issue that\n\nthe trial court must address in the first instance. See TEX. R. APP. P. 60.2(f) (providing that this\n\nCourt may “vacate the lower court’s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings in light\n\nof changes in the law”); In re Doe 2, 19 S.W.3d 278, 283 (Tex. 2000) (noting that rule 60.2(f) is\n\n“particularly well-suited” to situations in which courts must address novel situations).\n\n        Unlike the Mayor, however, the City is not a proper party to an ultra-vires claim. See\n\nHeinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372–73 (“[T]he governmental entities themselves—as opposed to their\n\nofficers in their official capacity—remain immune from suit. . . . [I]t follows that [ultra-vires] suits\n\ncannot be brought against the state, which retains immunity, but must be brought against the state\n\nactors in their official capacity.”). The City argued in its plea that the trial court must dismiss\n\nPidgeon’s claims against it because Pidgeon failed to plead or establish any waiver of the City’s\n\nimmunity. In response, Pidgeon argued that the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (the\n\nDJA) waives the City’s immunity against Pidgeon’s claim. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§§ 37.001–.011.\n\n\n\n\n        20\n            We note that neither the Supreme Court in Obergefell nor the Fifth Circuit in De Leon “struck down” any\nTexas law. When a court declares a law unconstitutional, the law remains in place unless and until the body that\nenacted it repeals it, even though the government may no longer constitutionally enforce it. Thus, the Texas and\nHouston DOMAs remain in place as they were before Obergefell and De Leon, which is why Pidgeon is able to bring\nthis claim.\n\n\n\n                                                        22\n\f         The City pointed out, however, that Pidgeon never mentioned the DJA in his petition, much\n\nless pleaded that it waived the City’s governmental immunity. At the hearing on the City’s plea,\n\nand in his brief in the court of appeals, Pidgeon acknowledged that he had not expressly pleaded a\n\nclaim or waiver under the DJA, but offered to amend his pleadings “to make the request for a\n\ndeclaration more explicit.” On remand, Pidgeon will have the opportunity to replead his claims\n\nagainst the City, and the City will have the opportunity to file a new plea to the jurisdiction as to\n\nany such claims.\n\n                                                       V.\n                                                    Conclusion\n\n         In Obergefell, the Supreme Court acknowledged that our historical view of marriage has\n\nlong been “based on the understanding that marriage is a union between two persons of the\n\nopposite sex.” 135 S. Ct. at 2594. It concluded, however, that this “history is the beginning of these\n\ncases,” and it rejected the idea that it “should be the end as well.” Id. But Obergefell is not the end\n\neither. Already, the Supreme Court has taken one opportunity to address Obergefell’s impact on\n\nan issue it did not address in Obergefell, and there will undoubtedly be others. See Pavan, ___\n\nU.S. at ___, 2017 WL 2722472, at *2.21 Pidgeon and the Mayor, like many other litigants\n\nthroughout the country, must now assist the courts in fully exploring Obergefell’s reach and\n\nramifications, and are entitled to the opportunity to do so.\n\n\n\n\n         21\n           On the same day the Supreme Court issued its per curiam opinion in Pavan, it also granted certiorari in\nanother case involving a same-sex-marriage issue Obergefell did not address. See Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop,\nInc., 370 P.3d 272 (Colo. App. 2015), cert. granted sub nom. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights\nComm’n, — U.S.L.W. — (U.S. June 26, 2017) (No. 16-111). The Court’s decision to hear and consider Masterpiece\nCakeshop illustrates that neither Obergefell nor Pavan provides the final word on the tangential questions Obergefell’s\nholdings raise but Obergefell itself did not address.\n\n\n                                                         23\n\f       Today, however, we are dealing only with an interlocutory appeal from a trial court’s\n\norders denying a plea to the jurisdiction and granting a temporary injunction. For the reasons\n\nexplained, we hold that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in De Leon does not bind the trial court on\n\nremand, and the trial court is not required to conduct its proceedings “consistent with” that case.\n\nWe hold that the court of appeals’ judgment does not bar Pidgeon from seeking all appropriate\n\nrelief on remand or bar the Mayor from opposing that relief. We hold that the court of appeals did\n\nnot err by failing to affirm the temporary injunction “to the extent” it required the City to claw\n\nback payments made prior to Obergefell. And we decline to instruct the trial court how to construe\n\nObergefell on remand. We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment, vacate the trial court’s\n\ntemporary injunction order, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with our judgment and this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                      _____________________\n                                                      Jeffrey S.

In the early 1970s, for\n\nexample, two men obtained a Texas marriage license when one of them appeared before the county\n\nclerk dressed as a woman. See James W. Harper & George M. Clifton, Comment, Heterosexuality;\n\nA Prerequisite to Marriage in Texas?, 14 S. TEX. L.J. 220, 220 (1972–73). In response, the Texas\n\nLegislature amended the Texas Family Code to expressly provide that a marriage license “may not\n\nbe issued for the marriage of persons of the same sex.” See Act of June 15, 1973, 63rd Leg., R.S.,\n\nch. 577, § 1, 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1596, 1596–97 (amending former Texas Family Code section\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f1.01). Texas thus became the second state in the Union1 to adopt what is often referred to as a\n\n“defense of marriage act” (DOMA).2\n\n         In response to early lawsuits, courts throughout the United States consistently rejected legal\n\nchallenges to the historical understanding of marriage.3 Beginning in the 1990s, many other states\n\nand the federal government4 enacted DOMAs to amend their statutes5—and in some states, their\n\nconstitutions6—to preserve the traditional view of marriage. Around the same time, however, other\n\n\n        1\n          A few weeks earlier in 1973, Maryland adopted a statute providing that “[o]nly a marriage between a man\nand a woman is valid in this state.” See 1973 Md. Laws 574 (enacting former MD. CODE art. 62, § 1 (1973)).\n         2\n            For simplicity’s sake, we use the acronym DOMA to refer generically to legislation intended to limit\nmarriage to one man and one woman or otherwise defend or promote that historical view.

Instead, their “avowed purpose and practical effect [were] to impose a\n\ndisadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made\n\nlawful by the unquestioned authority of [the] States.” Id. at 2693. Concluding that “no legitimate\n\npurpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom [a state], by its\n\nmarriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity,” the Court found the federal\n\ndefinitions unconstitutional. Id. at 2696.\n\n           Based on Windsor, the City of Houston city attorney advised then-Mayor Annise Parker\n\nthat the City “may extend benefits” to City employees’ same-sex spouses who were legally married\n\nin other states “on the same terms it extends benefits to heterosexual spouses.” In the attorney’s\n\nopinion, refusing to provide such benefits would “be unconstitutional.” Relying on this advice, on\n\nNovember 19, 2013, Mayor Parker sent a memo to the City’s human-resources director “directing\n\nthat same-sex spouses of employees who have been legally married in another jurisdiction be\n\nafforded the same benefits as spouses of a heterosexual marriage.” The City began offering those\n\nbenefits soon after the Mayor issued her directive.\n\n           A month later, on December 13, 2013, Pidgeon and Hicks9 filed suit against the City and\n\nthe Mayor10 in state court (Pidgeon I), challenging the Mayor’s directive and the City’s provision\n\n\n\n           9\n               Except when helpful to distinguish the two, we will generally refer to Pidgeon and Hicks collectively as\nPidgeon.\n           10\n            Except when helpful to distinguish the two, we will generally refer to the Mayor and the City collectively\nas the Mayor. Pidgeon sued Mayor Parker in her official capacity, as is required for an ultra-vires action. See City of\nEl Paso v. Heinrich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (Tex. 2009). Mayor Parker’s term ended on January 2, 2016, and Sylvester\nTurner took office on that date. When a public officer who is sued in an official capacity ceases to hold office before\nan appeal is resolved, her successor in office is automatically substituted as a party. TEX. R. APP. P. 7.2(a). Although\nMayor Turner did not initially issue the directive, he has expressed no intent to withdraw it and has continued to\ndefend it in this appeal.\n\n                                                             5\n\fof benefits pursuant to that directive. The Mayor removed Pidgeon I to federal court, which\n\nultimately remanded it back to state court. But by then, the state court had apparently dismissed\n\nthe suit for want of prosecution. Instead of challenging the dismissal of Pidgeon I, Pidgeon and\n\nHicks reasserted their claims by filing this suit (Pidgeon II) on October 22, 2014.\n\n        Pidgeon and Hicks alleged that they are Houston taxpayers and qualified voters, that the\n\nCity is “expending significant public funds on an illegal activity,” and that the Mayor’s directive\n\nauthorizing those expenditures violates Texas’s and the City’s DOMAs. Specifically, prior to\n\nWindsor, the City had amended its charter, and the State had amended the Texas Family Code and\n\nthe Texas Constitution, to more forcefully preserve the traditional view of marriage:\n\n        x       In 2001, the City’s voters signed and then approved a petition to amend the City’s\n                charter to provide that, except “as required by State or Federal law, the City of\n                Houston shall not provide employment benefits, including health care, to persons\n                other than employees, their legal spouses and dependent children.” CITY OF\n                HOUSTON CHARTER art. II, § 22. Although this language did not expressly refer to\n                same-sex relationships, the voters’ intent to deny tax-funded employment benefits\n                to same-sex partners was undisputed, as reflected in the title the City itself gave to\n                the new provision: “Denial of Benefits to Same-Sex Partners and Related\n                Matters.”11\n\n        x       In 2003, the Texas Legislature amended the Family Code to expressly provide that\n                (1) any “marriage between persons of the same sex . . . is contrary to the public\n                policy of this state and is void in this state”; and (2) the state or any agency or\n                political subdivision “may not give effect to” any “right or claim to any legal\n                protection, benefit, or responsibility asserted as a result of a marriage between\n                persons of the same sex . . . in this state or in any other jurisdiction,” TEX.

I, § 32.\n\n         Pidgeon alleged that these DOMAs remained valid and enforceable despite Windsor\n\nbecause Windsor addressed only the federal DOMA and its impact on persons married in states\n\nthat had elected to allow same-sex marriages. In Pidgeon’s view, Windsor merely required the\n\nfederal government to acknowledge marriages the various states may recognize; it did not require\n\nTexas or any other state to license same-sex marriages or recognize same-sex marriages performed\n\nin other states. Pidgeon sought unspecified actual damages as well as temporary and permanent\n\ninjunctive relief prohibiting the City from providing benefits to same-sex spouses of employees\n\nmarried in other jurisdictions.\n\n         The Mayor and City filed pleas to the jurisdiction asserting governmental immunity and\n\nchallenging Pidgeon’s standing to assert his claims.13 The trial court denied the pleas and granted\n\nPidgeon’s request for a temporary injunction prohibiting the Mayor “from furnishing benefits to\n\npersons who were married in other jurisdictions to City employees of the same sex.” The Mayor\n\nimmediately filed this interlocutory appeal challenging both the order denying the pleas to the\n\njurisdiction and the order granting the temporary injunction.\n\n\n       12\n          See OFFICE OF THE SEC’Y OF STATE, RACE SUMMARY REPORT: 2005 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\nELECTION (2005), http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist117_state.htm.\n         13\n            The City challenged Pidgeon’s standing to assert any of his claims against the City, but the Mayor initially\nchallenged only his standing to sue her for damages and attorney’s fees. She later filed a supplemental plea challenging\nall of Pidgeon’s claims. The trial court heard and ruled on all of the challenges together.\n\n                                                           7\n\f        Meanwhile, courts across the country were hearing other lawsuits challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of various state DOMAs. In Obergefell, the United States Supreme Court\n\nconsolidated and agreed to hear five of those cases, in which the plaintiffs alleged that their states’\n\nlaws denying same-sex couples the right to marry or prohibiting recognition of the legal validity\n\nof a same-sex marriage from another state violate the federal Constitution. 135 S. Ct. at 2593. On\n\nJune 26, 2015—while this case (Pidgeon II) remained pending on interlocutory appeal before the\n\nTexas court of appeals—the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Obergefell. Id. at\n\n2608.\n\n        In another 5-4 decision, the Court concluded in Obergefell that the state DOMAs at issue\n\nviolate “the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 2604.\n\nBased on that conclusion, the Court held that the states may not “exclude same-sex couples from\n\ncivil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples,” and may not “refuse to\n\nrecognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex\n\ncharacter.” Id. at 2605.\n\n        The Mayor then filed a supplemental brief in the court of appeals, arguing that Obergefell\n\nrequired the court to reverse the injunction. In response, Pidgeon argued that even if Obergefell\n\nrequires Texas to license and recognize same-sex marriages, it does not require “states to pay\n\ntaxpayer-funded benefits to same-sex relationships.” According to Pidgeon, Obergefell did not\n\nresolve his claims because federal courts cannot “commandeer state spending decisions.”\n\n        On July 28, 2015, the court of appeals reversed the trial court’s temporary injunction. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015). In a brief per curiam opinion, the court\n\nrecited Obergefell’s holdings that “same sex couples may exercise their fundamental right to marry\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fin all States,” and that “there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex\n\nmarriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.” Id. at 354 (quoting\n\nObergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2604–05, 2607–08). Noting “the substantial change in the law regarding\n\nsame-sex marriage since the temporary injunction was signed,” the court reversed the injunction\n\nand remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Id. at 355. We granted Pidgeon’s\n\npetition for review.14\n\n                                                     II.\n                                               Our Jurisdiction\n\n        We must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to review the court of appeals’\n\ninterlocutory decision. The Mayor appealed from the trial court’s orders denying her plea to the\n\njurisdiction and granting the temporary injunction. Texas law permits interlocutory appeals from\n\nsuch orders, see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 51.014(a)(4), (8), but currently, this Court’s\n\njurisdiction over interlocutory appeals “is limited.” TIC Energy & Chem., Inc. v.

In support of Pidgeon, we received amicus briefs from\none Texas Railroad Commissioner, eleven Texas Senators, forty Texas Representatives, and four then-candidates for\nthe Texas Legislature; fifteen “Conservative Leaders throughout Texas,” the U.S. Pastor Council, and Texas\nLeadership (aka the Texas Pastor Council); the Texas Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General; and the\nFoundation for Moral Law and the Institute for Creation Research.

One court “holds differently from another when there is inconsistency\n\nin their respective decisions that should be clarified to remove unnecessary uncertainty in the law\n\nand unfairness to litigants.” Id. § 22.225(e).\n\n       Pidgeon argues that the court of appeals’ decision in this case creates an inconsistency that\n\nshould be clarified. In its opinion, the court recited not only the Supreme Court’s holdings in\n\nObergefell, but also the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ holdings in a case called De\n\nLeon v. Abbott. See 477 S.W.3d at 354–55 (citing De Leon v.

Concluding that both decisions created a “substantial change in the law regarding\n\nsame-sex marriage since the temporary injunction was signed,” the court reversed the temporary\n\ninjunction and remanded the case to the trial court “for proceedings consistent with Obergefell and\n\nDe Leon.” Id. at 355. Pidgeon contends that the court’s requirement that the trial court proceed\n\n“consistent with” De Leon conflicts with our previous decisions holding that Fifth Circuit decisions\n\nare not binding on Texas courts.

Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1728662\"><a href=\"/opinion/1728662/penrod-drilling-corp-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n296 (Tex. 1993) (holding that while “Texas courts may certainly draw upon the precedents of the\n\nFifth Circuit, or any other federal or state court, . . . they are obligated to follow only higher Texas\n\ncourts and the United States Supreme Court”).\n\n       The Mayor agrees that De Leon is not binding on the trial court but contends that the court\n\nof appeals did not hold that it was. According to the Mayor, the court of appeals “did not rule on\n\nhow Obergefell and De Leon affect the ultimate outcome of [Pidgeon’s] claims,” and instead\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f“simply reversed the temporary injunction based on the change in the law and remanded to the\n\ntrial court, in the interest of justice, for proceedings consistent with those cases.”\n\n        We agree with the Mayor that the trial court could read the court of appeals’ opinion to\n\nhold merely that the trial court should consider De Leon as a persuasive authority when addressing\n\nPidgeon’s arguments. As the Mayor notes, the court of appeals suggested that it was remanding\n\nthe case “in the interest of justice” because the case “has not been fully developed.” 477 S.W.3d\n\nat 355 n.3 (citing TEX.

The court of appeals did not instruct\n\nthe trial court to proceed “in light of” or “considering” De Leon. Instead, it instructed the court to\n\nproceed “consistent with” De Leon.

Pidgeon does not argue that the court of\n\nappeals erred by dissolving the temporary injunction and remanding the case to the trial court.\n\nInstead, he contends that the court of appeals (A) should not have instructed the trial court to\n\nconduct further proceedings “consistent with” De Leon; (B) should not have reversed the\n\n                                                  11\n\ftemporary injunction, but instead should have vacated or dissolved it; and (C) should have affirmed\n\nthe temporary injunction “to the extent” it required the City to “claw back” benefits the City\n\nprovided to same-sex spouses before Obergefell. In addition, he (D) urges us to instruct the trial\n\ncourt to “narrowly construe” Obergefell on remand. We address each argument in turn.\n\nA      De Leon\n\n       Pidgeon first argues that by instructing the trial court to conduct further proceedings\n\n“consistent with” the Fifth Circuit’s decision in De Leon, the court of appeals’ opinion could be\n\nmisread to mean that De Leon is binding on the trial court. Whether De Leon is binding is crucial\n\nto Pidgeon’s case because unlike Obergefell, De Leon specifically held that the Texas DOMAs\n\nviolate the federal Constitution and cannot be enforced. See De Leon v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We\n\nagree with Pidgeon that the court of appeals should not have ordered the trial court to proceed on\n\nremand “consistent with” De Leon.\n\n       Two same-sex couples filed De Leon in federal court in San Antonio in 2013, shortly after\n\nWindsor issued. They sued the Texas Governor, the Texas Commissioner of the Department of\n\nState Health Services, and the Bexar County Clerk (collectively, the Governor), challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of the Texas DOMAs under the federal Constitution. The federal district court\n\nenjoined the Governor from enforcing the Texas DOMAs, holding that “Texas’ prohibition on\n\nsame-sex marriage conflicts with the United States Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection\n\nand due process,” 975 F. Supp. 2d at 639, and “Texas’ refusal to recognize . . . out-of-state same-\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fsex marriage[s] violates due process,” id. at 662. The Governor15 promptly appealed the injunction\n\nto the Fifth Circuit, where it remained pending until the Supreme Court decided Obergefell.\n\n         After the Supreme Court announced its decision in Obergefell, the Governor agreed with\n\nthe De Leon plaintiffs that the federal-court injunction was “correct in light of Obergefell.” Id. at\n\n625. The Fifth Circuit thus affirmed the injunction and remanded the case with instructions that\n\nthe district court enter a final judgment on the merits in the plaintiffs’ favor. Id. The Governor did\n\nnot oppose this disposition or seek the Supreme Court’s review. On July 7, 2015, the district court\n\nentered a final judgment declaring that the Texas DOMAs violate the federal Constitution’s due-\n\nprocess and equal-protection clauses and permanently enjoining the Governor “from enforcing\n\nTexas’s laws prohibiting same-sex marriage.” The parties agree that the State of Texas has been\n\nproviding benefits to state employees’ same-sex spouses ever since.\n\n         We agree with Pidgeon that De Leon does not bind the trial court in this case and the court\n\nof appeals should not have instructed the trial court to conduct further proceedings “consistent\n\nwith” De Leon. Penrod Drilling, 868 S.W.2d at 296.16 That does not mean, however, that the trial\n\n\n\n\n         15\n          Rick Perry was the Texas Governor when De Leon was filed in 2013. By the time Obergefell issued in\n2015, Greg Abbott was the Governor, having taken office in January of that year. Governor Abbott previously served\nas Texas Attorney General, and in that capacity, he represented Governor Perry in De Leon.

Fifth Circuit decisions,\n\nparticularly those regarding federal constitutional questions, can certainly be helpful and may be\n\npersuasive for Texas trial courts. Moreover, De Leon could potentially affect the relief the trial\n\ncourt might provide on remand, since De Leon has enjoined the Governor from enforcing the Texas\n\nDOMAs and the State of Texas is thus providing benefits to state employees’ same-sex spouses.\n\nThe trial court should certainly proceed on remand “in light of” De Leon, but it is not required to\n\nproceed “consistent with” it.\n\nB.     “Reversal” of the injunction\n\n       Pidgeon next argues that by “reversing” the trial court’s temporary injunction instead of\n\nvacating or dissolving it, the court of appeals’ judgment might be taken to have a res-judicata\n\neffect prohibiting Pidgeon from seeking or obtaining the same or similar relief on remand.

But in light of that change in the law, Pidgeon is not\n\nprecluded from seeking the same or similar relief on remand. On remand, the trial court must\n\nconsider both parties’ arguments regarding the effect of Obergefell on Pidgeon’s claims, and may\n\ngrant whatever relief is then appropriate.\n\nC.     “Claw-back” Relief\n\n       Pidgeon next argues that the court of appeals should have affirmed the temporary\n\ninjunction “to the extent” the injunction required the City to “claw back” tax dollars it expended\n\non benefits for same-sex spouses prior to Obergefell. Pidgeon reasons that Obergefell does not\n\napply retroactively to authorize pre-Obergefell expenditures because the Supreme Court\n\nacknowledged that it was attributing a new meaning to the Fourteenth Amendment based on “new\n\ninsights and societal understandings.” Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2603. According to Pidgeon,\n\nSupreme Court decisions apply retroactively when the Court determines and enforces the\n\n\n                                                15\n\fConstitution’s original meaning, see Harper v.

First, Pidgeon never requested an injunction requiring the City to\n\nclaw back benefits it provided before Obergefell; and second, the trial court never granted one.\n\nThe temporary injunction at issue here prospectively prohibited the City “from furnishing benefits\n\nto persons who were married in other jurisdictions to City employees of the same sex.” The order\n\ndid not to any extent require the City to recover benefits it had previously paid. It was a temporary\n\ninjunction, and its only “proper function” was to “preserve the status quo.” Coyote Lake Ranch v.\n\nCity of Lubbock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (Tex. 2016). We cannot conclude that the court of appeals\n\nerred by failing to preserve the injunction “to the extent” that it required a claw-back when it did\n\nnot require a claw-back to any extent.\n\n        Because Pidgeon has never yet sought a claw-back injunction, we express no opinion on\n\nwhether he has standing to seek one or whether he is entitled to one. We agree with Pidgeon,\n\nhowever, that the court of appeals’ opinion and judgment do not prohibit him from seeking such\n\nan injunction or any other relief on remand. But we conclude that the court of appeals did not err\n\nby reversing this temporary injunction in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fD.     Instructions on Remand\n\n       Finally, Pidgeon urges us to instruct the trial court to “narrowly construe” Obergefell on\n\nremand and to “comply with Obergefell but not to expand on it,” so as to “preserve as much of the\n\n[Texas DOMAs] as possible.” Pidgeon argues that we should provide these instructions because\n\nObergefell is “poorly reasoned,” has “no basis in the text or history of the Constitution,” and does\n\nnot “faithfully interpret” the Constitution. So construed, Obergefell may have recognized a\n\n“fundamental right” to same-sex marriage and may “require States to license and recognize same-\n\nsex marriages,” but, Pidgeon contends, it did not recognize a fundamental right “to spousal\n\nemployee benefits” or “require States to give taxpayer subsidies to same-sex couples.” Pidgeon\n\nargues that we should “remand for a new temporary injunction hearing” and the trial court should\n\n“consider on remand which applications of [the Texas DOMAs] can be preserved to the extent\n\nthey prohibit taxpayer subsidies for same-sex marriages.”\n\n       The Mayor agrees we should remand this case to the trial court, but contends that\n\nObergefell, and Windsor before it, held that the Constitution protects not only the right of same-\n\nsex couples to marry, but also to receive all of the “benefits” of marriage. See, e.g., Obergefell,\n\n135 S. Ct. at 2606 (declining to adopt a “slower, case-by-case determination of the required\n\navailability of specific public benefits to same-sex couples”); Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694\n\n(observing that the federal DOMA prevents “same-sex married couples from obtaining\n\ngovernment healthcare benefits they would otherwise receive”). The Mayor also contends that\n\nPidgeon lacks standing to challenge the Mayor’s directive under Obergefell, and rejects Pidgeon’s\n\nposition that Texas courts can “narrowly construe” Obergefell, at least to the extent that means\n\nthey can ignore its natural meaning and applications. See, e.g., McKinney v. Blankenship, 282\n\n\n                                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694–95 (Tex. 1955) (rejecting argument that Texas courts could ignore Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education since Texas’s segregation laws “were not before the Supreme Court” in that\n\ncase as “so utterly without merit that we overrule it without further discussion”).\n\n         We agree with the Mayor that any effort to resolve whether and the extent to which the\n\nConstitution requires states or cities to provide tax-funded benefits to same-sex couples without\n\nconsidering Obergefell would simply be erroneous.18 On the other hand, we agree with Pidgeon\n\nthat the Supreme Court did not address and resolve that specific issue in Obergefell. “Whatever\n\nramifications Obergefell may have for sexual relations beyond the approval of same-sex marriage\n\nare unstated at best . . . .” Coker v.

App. 2015) (“Obergefell did not answer\nquestions regarding Wisconsin’s presumption of paternity statute.”).\n\n                                                         19\n\f       Of course, that does not mean that the Texas DOMAs are constitutional or that the City\n\nmay constitutionally deny benefits to its employees’ same-sex spouses. Those are the issues that\n\nthis case now presents in light of Obergefell. We need not instruct to the trial court to “narrowly\n\nconstrue” Obergefell to confirm that Obergefell did not directly and expressly resolve those issues.\n\nBut neither will we instruct the trial court to construe Obergefell in any manner that makes it\n\nirrelevant to these issues. Pidgeon contends that neither the Constitution nor Obergefell requires\n\ncitizens to support same-sex marriages with their tax dollars, but he has not yet had the opportunity\n\nto make his case. And the Mayor has not yet had the opportunity to oppose it. Both are entitled to\n\na full and fair opportunity to litigate their positions on remand.\n\n       Although both parties agree that we should remand this case for the parties to have that full\n\nand fair opportunity, some amici have argued that we should resolve the parties’ dispute here on\n\nthis interlocutory appeal. We cannot resolve the parties’ claims now, however, because they have\n\nnot yet been fully developed or litigated. The parties’ arguments address the meaning and\n\nramifications of Obergefell, which was not announced until after the parties had filed their briefs\n\nin the court of appeals. Naturally, the parties did not raise their current arguments in the trial court\n\nor in the court of appeals, and neither court ruled on them. Many of the arguments—including\n\nthose addressing standing and retroactivity, for example—depend on an evidentiary record that the\n\nparties have not yet had the opportunity to develop. “Without an actual challenge . . . , without full\n\nbriefing from all parties . . . , and without complete vetting of the parties’ potential arguments in\n\nthe lower courts, we are ill-prepared to offer—and constitutionally prohibited from offering—an\n\nadvisory interpretation . . . that could have significant, lasting consequences.” Hegar v.

Adjudication of such\n\nproblems, certainly . . . should rest on an adequate and full-bodied record. The record before us is\n\nwoefully lacking in these requirements.”). We decline the amici’s requests that we render a final\n\nruling on the merits before the parties have had a full opportunity to make their case.\n\n                                              IV.\n                                            Immunity\n\n       Finally, we address the Mayor’s and the City’s interlocutory appeals from the trial court’s\n\norders denying their pleas to the jurisdiction based on governmental immunity. Although the\n\nparties briefed this issue in the court of appeals, they did so before Obergefell, and the court did\n\nnot address the issue in its opinion or its judgment. The Mayor noted the issue but reserved briefing\n\nin this Court. We are hesitant to ignore the issue because governmental immunity implicates the\n\ncourts’ subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Pidgeon’s claims. See Engelman Irrig. Dist. v. Shield\n\nBros., — S.W.3d —, — (Tex. 2017). But neither party has briefed the issue since Obergefell,\n\nwhich may also affect the immunity defenses.\n\n       The parties agree, for example, that Pidgeon sued the Mayor in her official capacity for\n\nacting ultra vires, that is, “without legal authority.” City of El Paso v. Heinrich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n372 (2009). Pidgeon alleges that the Mayor acted unlawfully and without authority by issuing and\n\nenforcing the directive because the Texas and Houston DOMAs prohibit the City from providing\n\nbenefits to employees’ same-sex spouses. Governmental immunity does not bar an ultra-vires\n\nclaim, but the parties disagree whether the Mayor’s directive remains unlawful and unauthorized\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fafter Obergefell.20 This disagreement may present the ultimate issue in this case, both on the merits\n\nand for purposes of determining whether the Mayor has acted ultra vires.\n\n        The trial court denied the Mayor’s plea, but it did so in 2014, prior to Obergefell. Whether\n\n(or the extent to which) Pidgeon alleges ultra-vires conduct even after Obergefell is an issue that\n\nthe trial court must address in the first instance. See TEX. R. APP. P. 60.2(f) (providing that this\n\nCourt may “vacate the lower court’s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings in light\n\nof changes in the law”); In re Doe 2, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1754345\"><a href=\"/opinion/1754345/in-re-doe-2/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283 (Tex. 2000) (noting that rule 60.2(f) is\n\n“particularly well-suited” to situations in which courts must address novel situations).\n\n        Unlike the Mayor, however, the City is not a proper party to an ultra-vires claim. See\n\nHeinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372–73 (“[T]he governmental entities themselves—as opposed to their\n\nofficers in their official capacity—remain immune from suit. . . . [I]t follows that [ultra-vires] suits\n\ncannot be brought against the state, which retains immunity, but must be brought against the state\n\nactors in their official capacity.”). The City argued in its plea that the trial court must dismiss\n\nPidgeon’s claims against it because Pidgeon failed to plead or establish any waiver of the City’s\n\nimmunity. In response, Pidgeon argued that the Texas Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (the\n\nDJA) waives the City’s immunity against Pidgeon’s claim. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\n§§ 37.001–.011.\n\n\n\n\n        20\n            We note that neither the Supreme Court in Obergefell nor the Fifth Circuit in De Leon “struck down” any\nTexas law. When a court declares a law unconstitutional, the law remains in place unless and until the body that\nenacted it repeals it, even though the government may no longer constitutionally enforce it. Thus, the Texas and\nHouston DOMAs remain in place as they were before Obergefell and De Leon, which is why Pidgeon is able to bring\nthis claim.\n\n\n\n                                                        22\n\f         The City pointed out, however, that Pidgeon never mentioned the DJA in his petition, much\n\nless pleaded that it waived the City’s governmental immunity. At the hearing on the City’s plea,\n\nand in his brief in the court of appeals, Pidgeon acknowledged that he had not expressly pleaded a\n\nclaim or waiver under the DJA, but offered to amend his pleadings “to make the request for a\n\ndeclaration more explicit.” On remand, Pidgeon will have the opportunity to replead his claims\n\nagainst the City, and the City will have the opportunity to file a new plea to the jurisdiction as to\n\nany such claims.\n\n                                                       V.\n                                                    Conclusion\n\n         In Obergefell, the Supreme Court acknowledged that our historical view of marriage has\n\nlong been “based on the understanding that marriage is a union between two persons of the\n\nopposite sex.” 135 S. Ct. at 2594. It concluded, however, that this “history is the beginning of these\n\ncases,” and it rejected the idea that it “should be the end as well.” Id. But Obergefell is not the end\n\neither. Already, the Supreme Court has taken one opportunity to address Obergefell’s impact on\n\nan issue it did not address in Obergefell, and there will undoubtedly be others.

See Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Colo.

The Court’s decision to hear and consider Masterpiece\nCakeshop illustrates that neither Obergefell nor Pavan provides the final word on the tangential questions Obergefell’s\nholdings raise but Obergefell itself did not address.\n\n\n                                                         23\n\f       Today, however, we are dealing only with an interlocutory appeal from a trial court’s\n\norders denying a plea to the jurisdiction and granting a temporary injunction. For the reasons\n\nexplained, we hold that the Fifth Circuit’s decision in De Leon does not bind the trial court on\n\nremand, and the trial court is not required to conduct its proceedings “consistent with” that case.\n\nWe hold that the court of appeals’ judgment does not bar Pidgeon from seeking all appropriate\n\nrelief on remand or bar the Mayor from opposing that relief. We hold that the court of appeals did\n\nnot err by failing to affirm the temporary injunction “to the extent” it required the City to claw\n\nback payments made prior to Obergefell. And we decline to instruct the trial court how to construe\n\nObergefell on remand. We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment, vacate the trial court’s\n\ntemporary injunction order, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with our judgment and this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                      _____________________\n                                                      Jeffrey S.
