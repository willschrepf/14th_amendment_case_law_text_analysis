A jury\nconvicted appellant as charged in the indictment, and the trial court assessed an enhanced\nsentence of life imprisonment. We affirm.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\n      Appellant first met the complainant when she was eight years old and appellant\nwas dating the complainant‘s mother. Appellant frequently visited the complainant‘s\nhome and eventually moved in with and married the complainant‘s mother. During the\nsummer of the complainant‘s sixth grade school year, appellant began engaging in sexual\n\factivity with the complainant, which intensified until 2005 when the complainant was\nfifteen years old. The complainant told her mother about the abuse approximately a week\nafter the complainant‘s last encounter with appellant, and the complainant‘s mother\ninformed law enforcement officials.\n\n      Appellant was indicted for intentionally and knowingly causing his sexual organ\nto contact the sexual organ of the complainant, who was younger than 17 years old at the\ntime, on or about December 23, 2005. The State‘s evidence primarily consisted of\ntestimony from the complainant, the complainant‘s mother, the doctor who conducted the\ncomplainant‘s medical examination after her outcry, a child sexual abuse expert, and\nAnthony McGuire—an inmate who was incarcerated in the Harris County jail with\nappellant as appellant awaited trial. McGuire testified that he and appellant were kept in\na separate area for sex offenders within the Harris County jail and that appellant told him\n―about his victim and that, you know, he slept with her a few times. He was infatuated\nwith her and everything like that.‖ McGuire testified:\n\n             He said that, you know they had oral sex and then just the regular\n      sex, you know, that you would have with a person. . . . He said he\n      [performed oral sex on] her. . . . He mentioned something about she got in\n      trouble at school, he had to go back and pick her up. They had like a little\n      something going in the car at that time. . . . He said [sexual acts occurred] a\n      few times at the apartment or wherever they were staying at, but that‘s all\n      he said.\n\n      The jury found appellant guilty as charged in the indictment.             During the\npunishment phase of the trial, appellant pleaded ―true‖ to an enhancement paragraph\nregarding a 1992 Kansas conviction for aggravated sexual battery. Based on this prior\nconviction, the trial court assessed an enhanced sentence of automatic life imprisonment\npursuant to Texas Penal Code section 12.42(c)(2).        See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §\n12.42(c)(2) (West 2011). Appellant raises nine issues on appeal.\n\n      In Issue 1, appellant argues that the trial court ―committed error by admitting into\nevidence a prior conviction during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial.‖ In Issue 2 and\nIssues 6 through 9, appellant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel\n\n                                            2\n\fbecause his trial counsel (1) failed to call any rebuttal witnesses in response to the\n―uncorroborated testimony‖ of McGuire; (2) advised appellant to plead ―true‖ to an\nenhancement paragraph that should not have been used; and (3) failed to object to the\ntrial court‘s use of the enhancement paragraph. In Issue 3, appellant argues that the trial\ncourt should have instructed the jury that it could not convict appellant on the\nuncorroborated testimony of an inmate regarding a statement against interest made by\nappellant while incarcerated.      In Issues 4 and 5, appellant argues that his Kansas\nconviction for aggravated sexual battery should not have been used to enhance his\nsentence because it does not contain elements that are substantially similar to elements of\nany of the enhancement offenses listed in section 12.42(c)(2). See id. We address\nappellant‘s issues out of order.\n\nI.     Uncorroborated Testimony of Inmate (Issue 3)\n\n       Appellant argues in Issue 3 that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it\ncould not convict appellant on the uncorroborated testimony of an inmate regarding a\nstatement against interest made by appellant while incarcerated. See TEX. CODE CRIM.\nPROC. art. 38.075 (West Supp. 2009).\n\n       Appellant did not request and the trial court did not give a jury instruction\npursuant to article 38.075. Article 38.075 states, in relevant part:\n\n              A defendant may not be convicted of an offense on the testimony of\n       a person to whom the defendant made a statement against the defendant‘s\n       interest during a time when the person was imprisoned or confined in the\n       same correctional facility as the defendant unless the testimony is\n       corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the\n       offense committed.\n\nId. Appellant argues that the trial court was under a duty to instruct the jury sua sponte\npursuant to this rule, regardless of whether he requested such an instruction.\n\n       No court has been asked since article 38.075 became effective in September 2009\ndirectly to decide whether it imposes such a duty on trial courts. See, e.g., Watkins v.\nState, 333 S.W.3d 771, 778–79 (Tex. App.—Waco 2010, pet. ref‘d) (noting that State\n\n                                              3\n\fconceded on appeal that trial court should have instructed the jury sua sponte pursuant to\narticle 38.075). However, a trial judge must instruct the jury sua sponte on the ―law\napplicable to the case.‖ See Oursbourn v. State, 259 S.W.3d 159, 180 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2008). Analyzing article 38.075 under case law applicable to similar corroboration\nrequirements, we conclude that the trial court was under a duty to instruct the jury sua\nsponte according to article 38.075. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.14 (West\n2005) (imposing similar corroboration requirement for accomplice witness testimony);\nHerron v. State, 86 S.W.3d 621, 631 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (trial court has a duty to\ninstruct jury sua sponte pursuant to article 38.14, if applicable); see also TEX. CODE\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.141 (West 2005) (imposing similar corroboration requirement\nfor informant testimony); Simmons v. State, 205 S.W.3d 65, 76–77 (Tex. App.—Fort\nWorth 2006, no pet.) (trial court has a duty to instruct jury sua sponte pursuant to article\n38.141, if applicable).\n\n       Though we conclude the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury according to\narticle 38.075, we nonetheless conclude that appellant was not egregiously harmed by the\ntrial court‘s unobjected-to failure to give such an instruction.\n\n       A.     Applicable Law and Standards\n\n       Article 38.075 does not tell the jury to be skeptical of inmate witness testimony;\nnor does it require the jury to give less weight to such testimony than to other evidence.\nSee TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.075; Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. An instruction\nunder article 38.075 ―merely informs the jury that it cannot use the . . . testimony unless\nthere is also some [independent] evidence connecting the defendant to the offense.‖ See\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.075; Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. ―Once it is\ndetermined that such . . . evidence exists, the purpose of the instruction is fulfilled, and\nthe instruction plays no further role in the factfinder‘s decision-making.‖ See Herron, 86\nS.W.3d at 632. Therefore, the existence of corroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖\nappellant to the offense can ―render harmless‖ the trial court‘s failure to submit an article\n38.075 instruction by fulfilling the purpose that such an instruction is designed to serve.\n\n                                              4\n\fSee id.\n\n          To analyze this issue, we eliminate all of McGuire‘s testimony regarding\nappellant‘s statements and ―determine if the remaining inculpatory evidence tends to\nconnect appellant to the offense.‖ See Freeman v. State, —S.W.3d—, No. 14-09-00399-\nCR, 2011 WL 3627697, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 18, 2011, no pet.\nh.) (citing Malone v. State, 253 S.W.3d 253, 257 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)). A harmless\nerror analysis for the omission of an article 38.075 witness instruction is flexible and\ntakes into account the existence and strength of such corroborating evidence and the\napplicable standard of harm. See Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. In determining the strength\nof corroborating evidence, we examine (1) its reliability or believability; and (2) the\nstrength of its tendency to connect the defendant to the crime. See id.\n\n          Under Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984) (op. on\nreh‘g), the appropriate harm analysis for jury charge error depends on whether the\ndefendant preserved error by bringing the improper omission to the trial court‘s attention.\nHerron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. When the error is properly preserved, a reversal is required if\n―some harm‖ is shown. Id. But when the defendant has failed to preserve error, as is the\ncase here, we only reverse for egregious harm. Id.\n\n          The difference in the harm standards impacts how strong the corroborating\nevidence must be for the error in omitting the instruction to be considered harmless. See\nid. Under the egregious harm standard, the omission of the instruction is generally\nharmless unless the corroborating evidence is ―‗so unconvincing in fact as to render the\nState‘s overall case for conviction clearly and significantly less persuasive.‘‖ See id.\n(quoting Saunders v. State, 817 S.W.2d 688, 692 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)).1 With these\n\n\n          The question of whether the absence of an instruction caused appellant ―some harm‖ generally\n          1\n\nwill turn on whether the record contains a significant amount of corroborating evidence, and whether the\nrecord reveals no rational basis on which the jury could have doubted or disregarded that evidence. See\nDavis v. State, 278 S.W.3d 346, 353 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (citing Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 631–34). This\nstandard is not applicable to our review of the trial court‘s unobjected-to failure to instruct the jury sua\nsponte, but it is relevant to our discussion in Part IV of appellant‘s ineffective assistance complaint\nregarding counsel‘s failure to request such an instruction. See id. (counsel‘s failure to request instruction\n                                                     5\n\fstandards in mind, we turn to the record to determine the reliability and strength of the\ncorroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖ appellant to the sexual assault charge.\n\n         B.     Corroborating Evidence\n\n         There is substantial evidence corroborating appellant‘s acts in furtherance of the\nassault. The complainant testified that one morning during the summer of her sixth grade\nschool year, appellant entered the room where she was watching a movie and asked her if\nshe ―wanted to try something new.‖ Appellant instructed the complainant to take off her\npants and underwear, and to get on the floor on her knees and forearms. Despite her\nreluctance, the complainant complied while appellant got on the floor behind the\ncomplainant ―with his pants around his ankles‖ and masturbated.\n\n         The complainant testified that the same thing happened many more times, and that\non different occasions she touched appellant‘s ―middle part, his hands . . . and sometimes\nhis chest,‖ and that appellant touched ―[m]y breasts, my behind, my middle part, my\nthighs, my legs, and that‘s it.‖ She testified that on one occasion, appellant interrupted\nthe complainant while she was showering and proceeded to shave her ―middle part‖ for\nher. On another occasion, appellant was letting the complainant drive his car when he\ntold her to ―pull over and pull down [her] pants and try to face him and he started\nmasturbating.‖ She testified that after these incidents, appellant often would buy her\ngifts.\n\n         The complainant also testified that appellant‘s penis has a ―line on it, like a scar.‖\nThe complainant‘s mother confirmed that appellant ―has an area where during his\ncircumcision that it was held funny, so it looks kind of like a scar or something like that.‖\nThe complainant‘s mother testified that she had never talked with the complainant about\nthe appearance of appellant‘s penis.\n\n         The complainant testified that despite the abuse, she still loved appellant and\n\n\nmay be deficient but not prejudicial only if corroborating evidence is insufficient to defeat finding of\n―some harm‖ from absence of instruction under Herron).\n\n                                                   6\n\fwanted to have a relationship with him. The last time the complainant saw appellant was\non December 20, 2005, which was after appellant and the complainant‘s mother had\ngotten a divorce.2 Appellant took her to a basketball game and then to a house where\nappellant was staying with a friend. Appellant showered and approached the complainant\nwithout any clothes on. He instructed her to take off her clothes and lay down on a bed.\nAppellant got on top of the complainant and told her that she had ―a nice body.‖ She\ntestified that appellant began ―rubbing his middle part up against mine and then told me\nto get on my stomach and did the same thing.‖ The complainant testified that appellant‘s\nsexual organ touched her sexual organ during this time, and then appellant ―put his\nmiddle part up against [her] behind.‖ Appellant then instructed the complainant to lick\nhis chest while he masturbated, something he made her to do on other occasions.\nAppellant took the complainant shopping afterward and bought her two new pairs of\nshoes.       About a week later, the complainant‘s mother asked the complainant ―if\nsomebody had done something to her,‖ and the complainant identified appellant.3\n\n         In response to the State‘s question about how many times appellant‘s penis\ntouched her vagina when she was under the age of 17, the complainant answered, ―Every\nweek, every day.‖ The complainant agreed that she was not making any allegations that\n         2\n          Defense witness Beverly Alexander testified that she had a short phone conversation with\nappellant on December 20, 2005. She also testified that she was with appellant at a barber shop between\nabout three and seven o‘clock on the afternoon of December 23, 2005, the ―on or about‖ date alleged in\nthe indictment. Appellant argues in his brief that this evidence ―challenged the child‘s testimony\nconcerning appellant‘s opportunity to have molested her on specific occasions.‖ Alexander‘s testimony\ndoes not contradict the complainant‘s testimony about events that allegedly took place on December 20,\n2005; additionally, the State is not required to prove that those events actually took place on December\n23, 2005, when Alexander testified she was with appellant at the barber shop. See Sledge v. State, 953\nS.W.2d 253, 255–56 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (―on or about‖ language in indictment allows State to prove\na date other than specific date alleged so long as the date is before the presentment of the indictment and\nwithin the statutory limitation period).\n         3\n          Appellant argues that parts of the complainant‘s testimony damaged her credibility. For\nexample, the complainant testified that she once witnessed appellant shaving her mother‘s ―middle part.‖\nThe complainant‘s mother testified that it would have been ―impossible‖ for the complainant to have seen\nthat because it only happened once, and the complainant was ―not even in that house.‖ The complainant‘s\nmother testified that ―[i]f she saw it, then this happened at a time I don‘t remember. I remember the first\ntime he shaved me, any time thereafter, I don‘t recall.‖ In response to defense counsel‘s question asking\nwhether the complainant‘s mother had ―ever had any problems with your daughter lying to you,‖ she\nanswered, ―Yes,‖ but testified that it was not a ―regular thing.‖\n\n                                                    7\n\fthe abuse involved penetration.4\n\n        Dr. Reena Issac testified that she examined the complainant after her outcry and\ndiscovered no signs of physical trauma to the anal-genital area. She explained that her\nfindings are (1) consistent with the complainant‘s particular allegations; and (2) common\namong victims of childhood sex abuse with a delayed outcry. The complainant informed\nDr. Issac about the history of abuse with details that are consistent with the complainant‘s\ntestimony. When Dr. Issac asked the complainant if appellant‘s penis was ever inside\nher, she answered, ―[N]o, he rubbed it. . . . [H]e tried to put it inside, it hurt and he\nstopped.‖\n\n        We do not believe this evidence is ―so unconvincing in fact as to render the State‘s\noverall case for conviction clearly and significantly less persuasive‖ without McGuire‘s\ntestimony. See Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. In fact, the complainant‘s testimony, along\nwith testimony from the complainant‘s mother and Dr. Issac, constitutes substantial\ncorroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖ appellant to the sexual assault charge.5\n\n        4\n            On cross-examination, appellant‘s fellow inmate McGuire testified:\n         Q. Okay. And when you say regular sex, how would you describe regular sex?\n         A. He said he had sex with her. What do you want me to say?\n         Q. You are testifying, sir, not me.\n         A. I told you that‘s what he told me; ―regular sex,‖ that‘s what he told me.\nAppellant‘s trial counsel argued in his closing statement that there was ―no evidence‖ that appellant\nengaged in ―regular sex‖ with the complainant, and that McGuire‘s testimony must have been an incorrect\n―guess.‖ Although this argument may have cast doubt on the believability of this particular part of\nMcGuire‘s testimony, it does not answer the question of whether, excluding McGuire‘s testimony\naltogether, there exists any corroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖ appellant to the offense.\n         Notwithstanding the standard we apply here, we note that the specific details contained in\nMcGuire‘s testimony were corroborated by other witnesses. For example, McGuire also testified that\nappellant told him the encounters with the complainant involved oral sex performed by appellant;\noccurred in an apartment ―or wherever they were staying,‖ as well as in a car; and were motivated by\nappellant‘s desire to show the complainant ―how [it is] right for a man and woman to have a relationship‖\nbecause the complainant had revealed to appellant that she believes herself to be gay. These details of the\nencounters were relayed by the complainant in her testimony as well.\n         5\n           The record reveals no rational basis on which the jury could have doubted or disregarded the\nsignificant amount of corroborating evidence, as would be relevant to appellate review of the record for\n―some harm‖ in the event that counsel had, in fact, preserved this issue for our review. See supra note 2;\nsee also Davis, 278 S.W.3d at 352; Gonzalez v. State, —S.W.3d—, No. 09-10-00478-CR, 2011 WL\n3925501, at *3–5 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Aug. 24, 2011, no pet. h.).\n\n                                                     8\n\fAccordingly, the trial court‘s failure to instruct the jury sua sponte pursuant to article\n38.075 did not egregiously harm appellant. See Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632; see also\nMedina v. State, 7 S.W.3d 633, 642–43 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (failure to give requested\narticle 38.14 instruction did not cause ―some harm,‖ in part because other witnesses‘\ntestimony linked defendant to crime); cf. Saunders, 817 S.W.2d at 692–93 (failure to give\narticle 38.14 instruction egregiously harmed defendant because only corroborating\nevidence was contradicted and, even if believed, did not have a very strong tendency to\nconnect defendant with crime).\n\n       We overrule appellant‘s Issue 3.\n\nII.    “Evidence of a Prior Conviction” (Issue 1)\n\n       Appellant argues in Issue 1 that the trial court ―committed error by admitting into\nevidence a prior conviction during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial.‖\n\n       McGuire testified that while he was incarcerated with appellant, they were\nsegregated based on their status as sex offenders. The State made one comment in\nclosing arguments regarding appellant‘s status as a sex offender: ―If the defendant did not\ntell [McGuire] those details [about appellant‘s sexual activity with the complainant], how\ndoes [McGuire] know that information? Well, ladies and gentlemen, he knows it because\nwhen they are in the Harris County jail, [appellant] found somebody he could brag to. He\nfelt comfortable bragging to [McGuire] because [appellant] knew [McGuire] was another\nsex offender.‖ Appellant argues that McGuire‘s testimony and the State‘s comment\nconstituted an indirect reference to appellant‘s 1992 Kansas conviction for aggravated\nsexual battery. Appellant failed to object to the admissibility of this testimony or to the\nState‘s arguments. Accordingly, he failed to preserve this issue for review. See TEX. R.\nAPP. P. 33.1.6\n\n       6\n          Appellant argues that we may nonetheless review the admissibility of the testimony because\nunder article 37.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court should have instructed the\njury that it should only consider evidence of ―an extraneous crime or bad act‖ that was properly\nintroduced during the punishment phase of the trial if the crime or act was shown beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See TEX. CODE. CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 37.07, § 3(a)(1) (West 2006 & Supp. 2011). Appellant\n                                                  9\n\f        Even if appellant had preserved this issue for our review, we do not agree with\nappellant that McGuire‘s testimony or the State‘s comment ―could have implied to the\njury that there were and are other prior convictions which caused Appellant to be\ndesignated as a sexual offender.‖\n\n        Even if a reasonable jury could have treated these comments as an implicit\nreference to a prior sex offense conviction rather than to appellant‘s status in the present\ncase as an alleged sex offender awaiting trial in the Harris County jail, any such\nmisunderstanding was eliminated during jury deliberations. The jury sent a note to the\ntrial court: ―The State‘s last witness, an inmate, gave testimony he claimed resulted from\nconversations between the Defendant and the witness while they were both incarcerated.\nWas the defendant incarcerated with the witness due to the allegations against the\nDefendant in this case?‖ The trial court responded, ―Yes.‖ In light of this clarification,\nwe conclude that the jury would not have misunderstood McGuire‘s testimony or the\nState‘s comment to be a reference to a prior conviction.\n\n        Accordingly, we overrule appellant‘s Issue 1.\n\nIII.    Kansas Conviction for Aggravated Sexual Battery (Issues 4 and 5)\n\n        Appellant argues in Issues 4 and 5 that his 1992 Kansas conviction for aggravated\nsexual battery should not have been used to enhance his sentence because it does not\ncontain elements that are substantially similar to elements in any of the enhancement\noffenses listed in section 12.42(c)(2). See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(c)(2)(B).\n\n        Section 12.42 provides enhanced penalties for repeat felony offenders. Section\n12.42(c)(2) ―effectively creates a ‗two-strikes policy‘ for repeat sex offenders in Texas,\nembodying the legislature‘s intent to treat repeat sex offenders more harshly than other\nrepeat offenders.‖ Prudholm v. State, 333 S.W.3d 590, 592 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\nSection 12.42(c)(2) imposes an automatic sentence of life imprisonment for a defendant\n\ndoes not explain why he was entitled to such an instruction during the guilt-innocence phase, or how this\nprocedural rule has any bearing on the question of whether appellant preserved his complaint about the\nadmissibility of evidence introduced during the guilt-innocence phase of a trial.\n\n                                                   10\n\fconvicted of a sexual offense listed in section 12.42(c)(2)(A) if he committed that offense\nafter previously having been convicted of any of the enumerated sexual offenses in\nsection 12.42(c)(2)(B), or ―under the laws of another state containing elements that are\nsubstantially similar to the elements of an [enumerated] offense.‖ Id.; see also TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(c)(2).\n\n       Before using a prior conviction from another state for this purpose, the trial court\nfirst must take judicial notice of the relevant state statute and make a finding that the\nelements of that offense are substantially similar to the elements of an offense\nenumerated in section 12.42(c)(2)(B). See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(c)(2)(B)\n(listing offenses that may be used to enhance sentence to automatic life imprisonment\nunder (c)(2)); Wagner v. State, Nos. 14-07-00906-CR & 14-07-00907-CR, 2009 WL\n838187, at *13 n.12 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Mar. 31, 2009, pet. ref‘d) (mem.\nop., not designated for publication) (as matter of statutory interpretation, trial court must\ntake judicial notice of statute from other state to make finding of substantial similarity\nunder section 12.42(c)(2) (citing TEX. R. EVID. 202 and Randolph v. State, No. 06-08-\n00058-CR, 2008 WL 5058597, at *1 (Tex. App.—Texarkana Dec. 2, 2008, no pet.)\n(mem. op., not designated for publication))). The trial court stated its finding on the\nrecord ―that the Kansas statute is similar to the charge [that] the jury just found\n[appellant] guilty of, sexual assault of a child [under section 21.011].‖\n\n       Appellant argues on appeal that the elements of the Kansas statute cannot be\n―substantially similar‖ because the Kansas statute includes any offensive ―touching,‖\nwhile the section 12.42(c)(2)(B) offenses criminalize only the offensive touching of\nspecific areas of the body. See, e.g., TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(c) (West 2011)\n(indecency with a child; defining certain prohibited ―sexual contact‖ as touching of the\nanus, breast, or any part of the genitals of the child by a person, or of the person by the\nchild); id. § 22.011(a)(2) (West 2011) (sexual assault of a child; prohibiting certain\npenetration of and contact between the mouth, anus, or sexual organ of a person and a\nchild). Appellant argues in his brief: ―The Kansas statute addresses much less offensive\n\n                                             11\n\fconduct than any of the pertinent Texas statutes; a touching of the hair, arm, hand,\nforehead, or literally any part of the body is sufficient under the Kansas statute . . . .‖\nAppellant failed to object to the trial court‘s finding or the imposition of the enhanced\nsentence. Appellant therefore has failed to preserve this issue for review on appeal. See\nTEX. R. APP. P. 33.1.\n\n        Even if appellant had preserved this issue, we conclude that the elements listed in\nthe Kansas statute for aggravated sexual battery are substantially similar to the elements\nof the Texas offense of indecency with a child, one of the enhancement offenses listed in\nsection 12.42(c)(2)(B).\n\n        We review the trial court‘s ―substantially similar‖ finding de novo. See TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(c)(2)(B); Hardy v. State, 187 S.W.3d 232, 236 (Tex. App.—\nTexarkana 2006, pet. ref‘d) (―substantially similar‖ determination is legal question of\nstatutory interpretation and must be reviewed de novo).7                    For two offenses to be\nsubstantially similar, the elements being compared first must display ―a high degree of\nlikeness, but may be less than identical.‖ Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 594. This ―high\ndegree of likeness‖ must involve more than similarity in merely ―a general sense.‖ See\nid. at 599. Secondly, ―the elements must be substantially similar with respect to the\nindividual or public interests protected and the impact of the elements on the seriousness\nof the offenses.‖ Id. at 595. With these considerations in mind, we turn to the elements\nrelevant to appellant‘s issues.\n\n        A.      “High Degree of Likeness”\n\n        Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense of aggravated sexual battery in Kansas on\nJune 26, 1992, based on the following allegations in the complaint:\n\n               [O]n or about the 5th day of May, 1992, [appellant] did then and\n        there unlawfully, willfully and feloniously touch the person of another, to-\n        7\n           Appellant first complains on appeal that the trial court‘s finding of ―mere similarity‖ does not\nconstitute a finding that the elements of the Kansas statute are substantially similar. Because we review\nthe trial court‘s use of the enhancement paragraph de novo, we need not decide whether the trial court‘s\narticulation of substantial similarity was sufficient.\n\n                                                    12\n\f        wit: M.M., a child under the age of sixteen (16) years, who was not the\n        spouse of the offender and who did not consent to the touching, with the\n        intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the offender.\n\nAggravated sexual battery was defined at that time, in relevant part, as ―sexual battery,‖\nor ―the intentional touching of the person of another . . . who is not the spouse of the\noffender and who does not consent thereto, with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual\ndesires of the offender or another,‖ against ―a person under 16 years of age.‖ KAN. STAT.\nANN. § 21-3518(b) (aggravated sexual battery statute in effect prior to July 1, 1993 and\nsubsequent amendments; current version at KAN. STAT. ANN. § 21-5505(b) (West 2010));\nKAN. STAT. ANN. § 21-3517 (sexual battery statute in effect prior to July 1, 1993 and\nsubsequent amendments; current version at KAN. STAT. ANN. § 21-5505(a) (West 2010)).\nAppellant‘s offense was punishable by a maximum sentence of three to ten years\nimprisonment and up to a $10,000 fine. KAN. STAT. ANN. § 21-4501(d) (statute in effect\nprior to July 1, 1993 and subsequent amendments; current version at KAN. STAT. ANN. §\n21-6701 (West 2010)) (classifying offense under 21-3518 as class D felony punishable by\n―a minimum of not less than two years nor more than three years and a maximum of not\nless than five years nor more than 10 years‖); KAN. STAT. ANN. § 21-4503(1)(b) (statute\nin effect prior to July 1, 1993 and subsequent amendments; current version at KAN. STAT.\nANN. § 21-6710 (West 2010)) (class D felony punishable by up to $10,000 fine).\n\n        A person commits the offense of indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code\nsection 21.11 if, with a child younger than 17 year of age, the person ―engages in sexual\ncontact with the child or causes the child to engage in sexual contact.‖ TEX. PENAL CODE\nANN. § 21.11(a)(1).8 ―Sexual contact‖ includes the following acts, ―if committed with\nthe intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person‖: (1) ―any touching by a\nperson . . . of the anus, breast, or any part of the genitals of a child‖; or (2) ―any touching\n\n        8\n          A person also commits an offense under this section if, with a child younger than 17 years of\nage, the person exposes the person‘s anus or any part of the person‘s genitals, knowing the child to be\npresent, or causes the child to expose the child‘s anus or any part of the child‘s genitals with the intent to\narouse or gratify the sexual desires of any person. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(a)(2). This type of\noffensive conduct is not relevant to our inquiry.\n\n                                                     13\n\fof any part of the body of a child . . . with the anus, breast, or any part of the genitals of a\nperson.‖ Id. § 21.11(c). An offense under the foregoing provision constitutes a felony of\nthe second degree, punishable by a sentence of between two and 20 years imprisonment\nand up to a $10,000 fine. Id. § 21.11(d); id. § 12.33 (West 2011).\n\n        Both these offenses share the following characteristics: (1) touching or contact; (2)\nbetween the offender and a child; (3) who is not the spouse of the offender; (4) with the\nintent to arouse, gratify, or satisfy the sexual desire of any person.9 The offenses differ in\nthat the Texas statute (1) does not require the element of non-consent;10 (2) also punishes\nactivity that ―causes the child to engage in sexual contact‖; (3) punishes offensive\nconduct involving a child younger than 17 years of age, in addition to offensive conduct\ninvolving a child younger than 16 years of age; and (4) limits the category of offensive\ncontact to specific areas of the body.\n\n        In deciding whether these differences defeat an otherwise ―high degree of\nlikeness,‖ we turn to the recent Court of Criminal Appeals decisions in Prudholm and\nWarren, which provide valuable guidance on how to analyze this issue. See Ex Parte\nWarren, — S.W.3d —, No. AP-76435, 2011 WL 4467224 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 28,\n2011); Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 590.\n\n        In Prudholm, the court addressed the question of whether the elements of the\nCalifornia sexual battery statute are ―substantially similar‖ to the elements of the Texas\nsexual assault statute for enhancement purposes under section 12.42. The Prudholm\ncourt concluded that the elements are not ―substantially similar,‖ in part because the\n―touching‖ of an ―intimate part‖ relevant to California offense of sexual battery\n\n\n        9\n          The Kansas definition of sexual battery requires that the offense be against a person ―who is not\nthe spouse of the offender‖ as an element of the offense. See K.S.A. 1983 Supp. 21-3518. Similarly but\nnot identically, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution under the Texas statute if the actor was the\nspouse of the child at the time of the offense. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(b-1).\n        10\n           However, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution under the Texas Statute under certain\ncircumstances if the actor was not more than three years older than the victim and of the opposite sex, and\nthe actor did not use duress, force, or a threat against the victim at the time of the offense. See TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(b).\n\n                                                    14\n\fencompassed ―a markedly different range of conduct‖ than ―penetration or contact‖ of a\nperson‘s ―anus‖ or ―sexual organ‖ relevant to the Texas offense of sexual assault.\nPrudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 599.             However, the court also found that the following\nconsiderations indicated that the statutes were designed to address different offensive\nconduct, and therefore weighed against a finding of substantial similarity: (1) the\nCalifornia statute specifically excluded the more severe offenses of rape and sexual\npenetration from its definition of sexual battery, while the Texas sexual assault statute\npurposely encompasses those offenses; (2) the ―offensive contact‖ relevant to the\nCalifornia sexual battery statute was more akin to the offensive contact encompassed by\nthe Texas assault statute, rather than the ―severe physical and psychological trauma of\nrape‖ encompassed by the Texas sexual assault statute; and (3) sexual battery in\nCalifornia was a misdemeanor punishable by only six months imprisonment, while sexual\nassault in Texas is a second degree felony punishable by a sentence of up to 20 years\nimprisonment. Id.11\n\n       Warren involved a statute that permits the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\nto impose sex-offender conditions on an inmate‘s parole without prior notice or an\nopportunity to respond if the inmate has been convicted of an offense in another state that\ncontains elements that are ―substantially similar‖ to the elements of certain sex-related\noffenses. See Warren, 2011 WL 4467224, at *1, *3–5; see also TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC.\nANN. art. 62.001(5) (West 2006 & Supp. 2011). The court in Warren concluded that the\nIllinois offense of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a child contained elements\nthat displayed a ―high degree of likeness‖ to the elements of the Texas offense of\nindecency with a child:\n\n               Both offenses involve sexual acts directed towards children: in the\n       Illinois statute, with ―any person under the age of 18‖; in the Texas statute,\n       ―with a child younger than 17 years of age[.]‖ Both offenses criminalize\n       similar sexual conduct with a child. The Illinois statue prohibits the ―lewd\n       11\n          The court did not address whether the California sexual battery statute contains elements that\nare substantially similar to the elements of the Texas offense of indecency with a child under section\n21.11.\n\n                                                  15\n\f       fondling or touching of [ . . . ] the child‖ and a ―lewd act done in the\n       presence of the child[.]‖ And the Texas statute prohibits ―engag[ing] in\n       sexual contact with the child‖ and ―expos[ing] the person‘s anus or any part\n       of the person‘s genitals[.]‖ Both statutes contain nearly the same mental\n       state. In the Illinois statute, the mens rea is ―with the intent to arouse or to\n       satisfy the sexual desires‖ of any person, while in the Texas, the mens rea is\n       ―with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person[.]‖ While\n       the elements of both statutes are not identical in every way, they are similar\n       enough to indicate a high degree of likeness and thus satisfy the first part of\n       the substantially similar test.\n\nWarren, 2011 WL 4467224, at *6.           We note that although it was not specifically\ndiscussed in Warren, the ―lewd fondling or touching‖ relevant to the Illinois statute, like\nthe touching relevant to the Kansas statue in this case, was not limited to the specific\nareas of the body identified in the Texas statute. See People v. Keesee (1977), 47\nIll.App.3d 637, 642, 365 N.E.2d 53, 57, 7 Ill.Dec. 768, 772 (analyzing offense of\ncontributing to the sexual delinquency of a child in effect at the relevant time period;\n―The statute does not limit, nor have we found a case which so limits, the fondling or\ntouching to the victim‘s sexual organs.‖).\n\n       Although the Kansas statute encompasses touching beyond the areas of the body\nidentified in the Texas statute, the elements are not required to be identical.           See\nPrudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 594. Additionally, the fact that an element of the Kansas\noffense would be insufficient to prove the respective Texas element is not determinative.\nSee id. at 594 n.15 (―For example, a Delaware defendant could be convicted for a\ntouching that was intended to be sexual in nature but was ultimately intended to\nembarrass or humiliate the victim, whereas such intent would not suffice under the Texas\nstatute to show an intent to arouse or gratify any person‘s sexual desire.‖ (discussing Ex\nparte White, 211 S.W.3d 316, 318 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007))). Unlike the differences at\nissue in Prudholm, the differences here are minor rather than major variations on the\nsame punishable conduct: the sexually-motivated touching of children. Like the offenses\nat issue in Warren, the elements of the offenses in this case display a ―high degree of\nlikeness‖ that goes beyond merely ―a general sense.‖ Warren, 2011 WL 4467224, at *6;\n\n\n                                             16\n\fPrudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 594, 599.\n\n       B.     Individual or Public Interests and the Seriousness of the Offenses\n\n       We next consider whether the elements are substantially similar ―with respect to\nthe individual or public interest protected and the impact of the elements on the\nseriousness of the offense.‖ See Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 595.\n\n       The individual and public interests protected by both statutes are clear: to\nsafeguard children from improper sexual conduct through sexually-motivated contact.\nThe Kansas statute furthered this goal by criminalizing the ―touching‖ of a child with the\nintent to arouse or satisfy sexual desire.        The Texas statute furthers this goal by\ncriminalizing ―sexual contact‖ with a child, which is defined more precisely as contact\nwith certain areas of the body, with the intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire.\n\n       This conclusion is bolstered by that fact that both offenses are felonies punishable\nby multiple-year sentence ranges, which indicates that both states similarly treat the\noffensive conduct with severity. See Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 595. Both offenses are\npunishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and a minimum sentence of two or three years.\nThat the Texas offense carries a maximum sentence of twenty years, while the Kansas\noffense carries a maximum sentence of ten years, is not so significant a difference that it\ndefeats a finding of substantial similarity. Compare id. at 599 (―[T]he difference in the\nsexual elements results in a much less serious California offense. . . . [S]exual battery is\na misdemeanor punishable by only six months imprisonment, while sexual assault is a\nsecond degree felony punishable by twenty years imprisonment.‖), with Warren, 2011\nWL 4467224, at *7 (although punishment applicable almost forty years earlier was for a\nmisdemeanor offense with a sentence of less than one year and/or a fine of less than\n$1,000, contemporary punishment, which treats offensive conduct as felonious with a\nsentence of ―various ranges of terms of imprisonment,‖ supported finding of substantial\nsimilarity). We conclude that the elements of both offenses are ―substantially similar\nwith respect to the individual or public interests protected and the impact of the elements\non the seriousness of the offenses.‖ See Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 595.\n\n                                             17\n\f       Having found the elements of appellant‘s Kansas conviction to be ―substantially\nsimilar‖ to one of the enhancement offenses enumerated in 12.42(c)(2)(B), we overrule\nappellant‘s Issues 4 and 5.\n\nIV.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (Issues 2, 6–9)\n\n       In Issue 2 and Issues 6 through 9, appellant argues for the first time on appeal that\nhe was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel (1) failed to call\nany rebuttal witnesses in response to the ―uncorroborated testimony‖ of McGuire; (2)\nadvised appellant to plead ―true‖ to an enhancement paragraph that should not have been\nused; and (3) failed to object to the enhancement paragraph.\n\n       An ineffective assistance of counsel issue may be raised for the first time on direct\nappeal, although the record on such a direct appeal often will not be sufficient to show\nthat counsel was ineffective. Cannon v. State, 252 S.W.3d 342, 347 n. 6, 350 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2008). In determining whether his trial counsel‘s representation was ineffective\nsuch that it violated appellant‘s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, we use the two-prong\ntest laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). See Thompson v. State, 9\nS.W.3d 808, 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668). To\nestablish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) his counsel‘s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) but for counsel‘s\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id.\n\n       We assess whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel\naccording to the facts of each case. Id. at 813. Any allegation of ineffectiveness must be\nfirmly founded in the record, and the record must affirmatively demonstrate the alleged\nineffectiveness. Id. Appellant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\nevidence that counsel was ineffective. Id. We look to the totality of the representation\nand particular circumstances of each case in evaluating the effectiveness of counsel. Id.\nWe must be ―highly deferential to trial counsel and avoid the deleterious effects of\nhindsight.‖ Lane v. State, 257 S.W.3d 22, 26 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008,\npet. ref‘d). Trial counsel is strongly presumed to have acted within the wide range of\n\n                                            18\n\freasonable professional assistance. Perez v. State, 310 S.W.3d 890, 893 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2010). With these standards in mind, we turn to appellant‘s arguments.\n\n      A.     Rebuttal Witnesses\n\n      Appellant argues in Issue 2 that he was denied effective assistance of counsel\nbecause his trial counsel failed to call any rebuttal witnesses in response to the\n―uncorroborated testimony‖ of McGuire. Appellant states:\n\n              Appellant contends that he was not afforded effective assistance of\n      counsel due to trial counsel‘s failure to present any defense witnesses in\n      rebuttal of the testimony of [McGuire]. Appellant alleges that he informed\n      his trial counsel regarding the availability of said witnesses and requested\n      that the attorney subpoena said witnesses.\n             ....\n             Appellant‘s attorneys did not attempt to call any witnesses nor\n      produce any evidence to attack the credibility of [McGuire]. His testimony\n      went . . . unchallenged by the Appellant‘s trial attorneys. . . . [McGuire‘s]\n      other cell mates could have been called to show that there were over 40\n      other men in the jail tank and no private conversation between [McGuire\n      and appellant] were [sic] overheard by anyone.‖\n\nAn ineffective assistance claim can be premised upon an attorney‘s failure to present\nwitnesses only if the appellant can show that the witnesses were available and that their\ntestimony would have benefitted him. See Ex parte McFarland, 163 S.W.3d 743, 757–58\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (―Applicant has failed to name any specific witnesses . . . whom\nhis attorneys should have contacted or called as mitigation witnesses. Likewise, he has\nfailed to show that these unnamed witnesses were available to testify or that their\ntestimony would have benefitted him.        Therefore, he fails to show prejudice.‖).\nAppellant has not made this showing. Moreover, counsel‘s reasons for not presenting\nsuch testimony do not appear in the record. See Garza v. State, 213 S.W.3d 338, 348\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). We will not sustain an allegation of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel unless it is firmly founded and affirmatively demonstrated in the appellate\nrecord. Stephens v. State, 15 S.W.3d 278, 279–80 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2009, pet. ref‘d) (citing McFarland v. State, 928 S.W.2d 482, 400 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n                                           19\n\f1996), and Jiminez v. State, 804 S.W.2d 334, 338 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1991, pet.\nref‘d)). We overrule appellant‘s Issue 2 based on this argument.12\n\n        Although not captured by appellant‘s Issues Presented, appellant also complains in\nIssue 2 that his trial counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to object to the evidence and\narguments that allegedly constituted an implicit reference to appellant‘s Kansas\nconviction, as discussed in Issue 1; and (2) failing to object to and request an instruction\nregarding the ―uncorroborated‖ testimony of McGuire, as discussed in Issue 3.

A jury\nconvicted appellant as charged in the indictment, and the trial court assessed an enhanced\nsentence of life imprisonment. We affirm.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\n      Appellant first met the complainant when she was eight years old and appellant\nwas dating the complainant‘s mother. Appellant frequently visited the complainant‘s\nhome and eventually moved in with and married the complainant‘s mother. During the\nsummer of the complainant‘s sixth grade school year, appellant began engaging in sexual\n\factivity with the complainant, which intensified until 2005 when the complainant was\nfifteen years old. The complainant told her mother about the abuse approximately a week\nafter the complainant‘s last encounter with appellant, and the complainant‘s mother\ninformed law enforcement officials.\n\n      Appellant was indicted for intentionally and knowingly causing his sexual organ\nto contact the sexual organ of the complainant, who was younger than 17 years old at the\ntime, on or about December 23, 2005. The State‘s evidence primarily consisted of\ntestimony from the complainant, the complainant‘s mother, the doctor who conducted the\ncomplainant‘s medical examination after her outcry, a child sexual abuse expert, and\nAnthony McGuire—an inmate who was incarcerated in the Harris County jail with\nappellant as appellant awaited trial. McGuire testified that he and appellant were kept in\na separate area for sex offenders within the Harris County jail and that appellant told him\n―about his victim and that, you know, he slept with her a few times. He was infatuated\nwith her and everything like that.‖ McGuire testified:\n\n             He said that, you know they had oral sex and then just the regular\n      sex, you know, that you would have with a person. . . . He said he\n      [performed oral sex on] her. . . . He mentioned something about she got in\n      trouble at school, he had to go back and pick her up. They had like a little\n      something going in the car at that time. . . . He said [sexual acts occurred] a\n      few times at the apartment or wherever they were staying at, but that‘s all\n      he said.\n\n      The jury found appellant guilty as charged in the indictment.             During the\npunishment phase of the trial, appellant pleaded ―true‖ to an enhancement paragraph\nregarding a 1992 Kansas conviction for aggravated sexual battery. Based on this prior\nconviction, the trial court assessed an enhanced sentence of automatic life imprisonment\npursuant to Texas Penal Code section 12.42(c)(2).        See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. §\n12.42(c)(2) (West 2011). Appellant raises nine issues on appeal.\n\n      In Issue 1, appellant argues that the trial court ―committed error by admitting into\nevidence a prior conviction during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial.‖ In Issue 2 and\nIssues 6 through 9, appellant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel\n\n                                            2\n\fbecause his trial counsel (1) failed to call any rebuttal witnesses in response to the\n―uncorroborated testimony‖ of McGuire; (2) advised appellant to plead ―true‖ to an\nenhancement paragraph that should not have been used; and (3) failed to object to the\ntrial court‘s use of the enhancement paragraph. In Issue 3, appellant argues that the trial\ncourt should have instructed the jury that it could not convict appellant on the\nuncorroborated testimony of an inmate regarding a statement against interest made by\nappellant while incarcerated.      In Issues 4 and 5, appellant argues that his Kansas\nconviction for aggravated sexual battery should not have been used to enhance his\nsentence because it does not contain elements that are substantially similar to elements of\nany of the enhancement offenses listed in section 12.42(c)(2). See id. We address\nappellant‘s issues out of order.\n\nI.     Uncorroborated Testimony of Inmate (Issue 3)\n\n       Appellant argues in Issue 3 that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it\ncould not convict appellant on the uncorroborated testimony of an inmate regarding a\nstatement against interest made by appellant while incarcerated. See TEX. CODE CRIM.\nPROC. art. 38.075 (West Supp. 2009).\n\n       Appellant did not request and the trial court did not give a jury instruction\npursuant to article 38.075. Article 38.075 states, in relevant part:\n\n              A defendant may not be convicted of an offense on the testimony of\n       a person to whom the defendant made a statement against the defendant‘s\n       interest during a time when the person was imprisoned or confined in the\n       same correctional facility as the defendant unless the testimony is\n       corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the\n       offense committed.\n\nId. Appellant argues that the trial court was under a duty to instruct the jury sua sponte\npursuant to this rule, regardless of whether he requested such an instruction.\n\n       No court has been asked since article 38.075 became effective in September 2009\ndirectly to decide whether it imposes such a duty on trial courts. See, e.g., Watkins v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280983\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280983/watkins-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 778–79 (Tex.

However, a trial judge must instruct the jury sua sponte on the ―law\napplicable to the case.‖ See Oursbourn v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334003\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334003/oursbourn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (Tex.

Analyzing article 38.075 under case law applicable to similar corroboration\nrequirements, we conclude that the trial court was under a duty to instruct the jury sua\nsponte according to article 38.075.

App.—Fort\nWorth 2006, no pet.) (trial court has a duty to instruct jury sua sponte pursuant to article\n38.141, if applicable).\n\n       Though we conclude the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury according to\narticle 38.075, we nonetheless conclude that appellant was not egregiously harmed by the\ntrial court‘s unobjected-to failure to give such an instruction.\n\n       A.     Applicable Law and Standards\n\n       Article 38.075 does not tell the jury to be skeptical of inmate witness testimony;\nnor does it require the jury to give less weight to such testimony than to other evidence.\nSee TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.075; Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. An instruction\nunder article 38.075 ―merely informs the jury that it cannot use the . . . testimony unless\nthere is also some [independent] evidence connecting the defendant to the offense.‖ See\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.075; Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. ―Once it is\ndetermined that such . . . evidence exists, the purpose of the instruction is fulfilled, and\nthe instruction plays no further role in the factfinder‘s decision-making.‖ See Herron, 86\nS.W.3d at 632. Therefore, the existence of corroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖\nappellant to the offense can ―render harmless‖ the trial court‘s failure to submit an article\n38.075 instruction by fulfilling the purpose that such an instruction is designed to serve.\n\n                                              4\n\fSee id.\n\n          To analyze this issue, we eliminate all of McGuire‘s testimony regarding\nappellant‘s statements and ―determine if the remaining inculpatory evidence tends to\nconnect appellant to the offense.‖ See Freeman v. State, —S.W.3d—, No. 14-09-00399-\nCR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3627697</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tex.

Crim. App. 2008)). A harmless\nerror analysis for the omission of an article 38.075 witness instruction is flexible and\ntakes into account the existence and strength of such corroborating evidence and the\napplicable standard of harm. See Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. In determining the strength\nof corroborating evidence, we examine (1) its reliability or believability; and (2) the\nstrength of its tendency to connect the defendant to the crime. See id.\n\n          Under Almanza v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984) (op. on\nreh‘g), the appropriate harm analysis for jury charge error depends on whether the\ndefendant preserved error by bringing the improper omission to the trial court‘s attention.\nHerron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. When the error is properly preserved, a reversal is required if\n―some harm‖ is shown. Id. But when the defendant has failed to preserve error, as is the\ncase here, we only reverse for egregious harm. Id.\n\n          The difference in the harm standards impacts how strong the corroborating\nevidence must be for the error in omitting the instruction to be considered harmless. See\nid. Under the egregious harm standard, the omission of the instruction is generally\nharmless unless the corroborating evidence is ―‗so unconvincing in fact as to render the\nState‘s overall case for conviction clearly and significantly less persuasive.‘‖ See id.\n(quoting Saunders v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429203\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429203/saunders-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 692 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)).1 With these\n\n\n          The question of whether the absence of an instruction caused appellant ―some harm‖ generally\n          1\n\nwill turn on whether the record contains a significant amount of corroborating evidence, and whether the\nrecord reveals no rational basis on which the jury could have doubted or disregarded that evidence. See\nDavis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427832\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427832/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (citing Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 631–34). This\nstandard is not applicable to our review of the trial court‘s unobjected-to failure to instruct the jury sua\nsponte, but it is relevant to our discussion in Part IV of appellant‘s ineffective assistance complaint\nregarding counsel‘s failure to request such an instruction. See id. (counsel‘s failure to request instruction\n                                                     5\n\fstandards in mind, we turn to the record to determine the reliability and strength of the\ncorroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖ appellant to the sexual assault charge.\n\n         B.     Corroborating Evidence\n\n         There is substantial evidence corroborating appellant‘s acts in furtherance of the\nassault. The complainant testified that one morning during the summer of her sixth grade\nschool year, appellant entered the room where she was watching a movie and asked her if\nshe ―wanted to try something new.‖ Appellant instructed the complainant to take off her\npants and underwear, and to get on the floor on her knees and forearms. Despite her\nreluctance, the complainant complied while appellant got on the floor behind the\ncomplainant ―with his pants around his ankles‖ and masturbated.\n\n         The complainant testified that the same thing happened many more times, and that\non different occasions she touched appellant‘s ―middle part, his hands . . . and sometimes\nhis chest,‖ and that appellant touched ―[m]y breasts, my behind, my middle part, my\nthighs, my legs, and that‘s it.‖ She testified that on one occasion, appellant interrupted\nthe complainant while she was showering and proceeded to shave her ―middle part‖ for\nher. On another occasion, appellant was letting the complainant drive his car when he\ntold her to ―pull over and pull down [her] pants and try to face him and he started\nmasturbating.‖ She testified that after these incidents, appellant often would buy her\ngifts.\n\n         The complainant also testified that appellant‘s penis has a ―line on it, like a scar.‖\nThe complainant‘s mother confirmed that appellant ―has an area where during his\ncircumcision that it was held funny, so it looks kind of like a scar or something like that.‖\nThe complainant‘s mother testified that she had never talked with the complainant about\nthe appearance of appellant‘s penis.\n\n         The complainant testified that despite the abuse, she still loved appellant and\n\n\nmay be deficient but not prejudicial only if corroborating evidence is insufficient to defeat finding of\n―some harm‖ from absence of instruction under Herron).\n\n                                                   6\n\fwanted to have a relationship with him. The last time the complainant saw appellant was\non December 20, 2005, which was after appellant and the complainant‘s mother had\ngotten a divorce.2 Appellant took her to a basketball game and then to a house where\nappellant was staying with a friend. Appellant showered and approached the complainant\nwithout any clothes on. He instructed her to take off her clothes and lay down on a bed.\nAppellant got on top of the complainant and told her that she had ―a nice body.‖ She\ntestified that appellant began ―rubbing his middle part up against mine and then told me\nto get on my stomach and did the same thing.‖ The complainant testified that appellant‘s\nsexual organ touched her sexual organ during this time, and then appellant ―put his\nmiddle part up against [her] behind.‖ Appellant then instructed the complainant to lick\nhis chest while he masturbated, something he made her to do on other occasions.\nAppellant took the complainant shopping afterward and bought her two new pairs of\nshoes.       About a week later, the complainant‘s mother asked the complainant ―if\nsomebody had done something to her,‖ and the complainant identified appellant.3\n\n         In response to the State‘s question about how many times appellant‘s penis\ntouched her vagina when she was under the age of 17, the complainant answered, ―Every\nweek, every day.‖ The complainant agreed that she was not making any allegations that\n         2\n          Defense witness Beverly Alexander testified that she had a short phone conversation with\nappellant on December 20, 2005. She also testified that she was with appellant at a barber shop between\nabout three and seven o‘clock on the afternoon of December 23, 2005, the ―on or about‖ date alleged in\nthe indictment. Appellant argues in his brief that this evidence ―challenged the child‘s testimony\nconcerning appellant‘s opportunity to have molested her on specific occasions.‖ Alexander‘s testimony\ndoes not contradict the complainant‘s testimony about events that allegedly took place on December 20,\n2005; additionally, the State is not required to prove that those events actually took place on December\n23, 2005, when Alexander testified she was with appellant at the barber shop. See Sledge v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518955/sledge-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255–56 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (―on or about‖ language in indictment allows State to prove\na date other than specific date alleged so long as the date is before the presentment of the indictment and\nwithin the statutory limitation period).\n         3\n          Appellant argues that parts of the complainant‘s testimony damaged her credibility. For\nexample, the complainant testified that she once witnessed appellant shaving her mother‘s ―middle part.‖\nThe complainant‘s mother testified that it would have been ―impossible‖ for the complainant to have seen\nthat because it only happened once, and the complainant was ―not even in that house.‖ The complainant‘s\nmother testified that ―[i]f she saw it, then this happened at a time I don‘t remember. I remember the first\ntime he shaved me, any time thereafter, I don‘t recall.‖ In response to defense counsel‘s question asking\nwhether the complainant‘s mother had ―ever had any problems with your daughter lying to you,‖ she\nanswered, ―Yes,‖ but testified that it was not a ―regular thing.‖\n\n                                                    7\n\fthe abuse involved penetration.4\n\n        Dr. Reena Issac testified that she examined the complainant after her outcry and\ndiscovered no signs of physical trauma to the anal-genital area. She explained that her\nfindings are (1) consistent with the complainant‘s particular allegations; and (2) common\namong victims of childhood sex abuse with a delayed outcry. The complainant informed\nDr. Issac about the history of abuse with details that are consistent with the complainant‘s\ntestimony. When Dr. Issac asked the complainant if appellant‘s penis was ever inside\nher, she answered, ―[N]o, he rubbed it. . . . [H]e tried to put it inside, it hurt and he\nstopped.‖\n\n        We do not believe this evidence is ―so unconvincing in fact as to render the State‘s\noverall case for conviction clearly and significantly less persuasive‖ without McGuire‘s\ntestimony. See Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. In fact, the complainant‘s testimony, along\nwith testimony from the complainant‘s mother and Dr. Issac, constitutes substantial\ncorroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖ appellant to the sexual assault charge.5\n\n        4\n            On cross-examination, appellant‘s fellow inmate McGuire testified:\n         Q. Okay. And when you say regular sex, how would you describe regular sex?\n         A. He said he had sex with her. What do you want me to say?\n         Q. You are testifying, sir, not me.\n         A. I told you that‘s what he told me; ―regular sex,‖ that‘s what he told me.\nAppellant‘s trial counsel argued in his closing statement that there was ―no evidence‖ that appellant\nengaged in ―regular sex‖ with the complainant, and that McGuire‘s testimony must have been an incorrect\n―guess.‖ Although this argument may have cast doubt on the believability of this particular part of\nMcGuire‘s testimony, it does not answer the question of whether, excluding McGuire‘s testimony\naltogether, there exists any corroborating evidence ―tending to connect‖ appellant to the offense.\n         Notwithstanding the standard we apply here, we note that the specific details contained in\nMcGuire‘s testimony were corroborated by other witnesses. For example, McGuire also testified that\nappellant told him the encounters with the complainant involved oral sex performed by appellant;\noccurred in an apartment ―or wherever they were staying,‖ as well as in a car; and were motivated by\nappellant‘s desire to show the complainant ―how [it is] right for a man and woman to have a relationship‖\nbecause the complainant had revealed to appellant that she believes herself to be gay. These details of the\nencounters were relayed by the complainant in her testimony as well.\n         5\n           The record reveals no rational basis on which the jury could have doubted or disregarded the\nsignificant amount of corroborating evidence, as would be relevant to appellate review of the record for\n―some harm‖ in the event that counsel had, in fact, preserved this issue for our review.

Saunders, 817 S.W.2d at 692–93 (failure to give\narticle 38.14 instruction egregiously harmed defendant because only corroborating\nevidence was contradicted and, even if believed, did not have a very strong tendency to\nconnect defendant with crime).\n\n       We overrule appellant‘s Issue 3.\n\nII.    “Evidence of a Prior Conviction” (Issue 1)\n\n       Appellant argues in Issue 1 that the trial court ―committed error by admitting into\nevidence a prior conviction during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial.‖\n\n       McGuire testified that while he was incarcerated with appellant, they were\nsegregated based on their status as sex offenders. The State made one comment in\nclosing arguments regarding appellant‘s status as a sex offender: ―If the defendant did not\ntell [McGuire] those details [about appellant‘s sexual activity with the complainant], how\ndoes [McGuire] know that information? Well, ladies and gentlemen, he knows it because\nwhen they are in the Harris County jail, [appellant] found somebody he could brag to. He\nfelt comfortable bragging to [McGuire] because [appellant] knew [McGuire] was another\nsex offender.‖ Appellant argues that McGuire‘s testimony and the State‘s comment\nconstituted an indirect reference to appellant‘s 1992 Kansas conviction for aggravated\nsexual battery. Appellant failed to object to the admissibility of this testimony or to the\nState‘s arguments. Accordingly, he failed to preserve this issue for review. See TEX. R.\nAPP. P. 33.1.6\n\n       6\n          Appellant argues that we may nonetheless review the admissibility of the testimony because\nunder article 37.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court should have instructed the\njury that it should only consider evidence of ―an extraneous crime or bad act‖ that was properly\nintroduced during the punishment phase of the trial if the crime or act was shown beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See TEX. CODE. CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 37.07, § 3(a)(1) (West 2006 & Supp. 2011). Appellant\n                                                  9\n\f        Even if appellant had preserved this issue for our review, we do not agree with\nappellant that McGuire‘s testimony or the State‘s comment ―could have implied to the\njury that there were and are other prior convictions which caused Appellant to be\ndesignated as a sexual offender.‖\n\n        Even if a reasonable jury could have treated these comments as an implicit\nreference to a prior sex offense conviction rather than to appellant‘s status in the present\ncase as an alleged sex offender awaiting trial in the Harris County jail, any such\nmisunderstanding was eliminated during jury deliberations. The jury sent a note to the\ntrial court: ―The State‘s last witness, an inmate, gave testimony he claimed resulted from\nconversations between the Defendant and the witness while they were both incarcerated.\nWas the defendant incarcerated with the witness due to the allegations against the\nDefendant in this case?‖ The trial court responded, ―Yes.‖ In light of this clarification,\nwe conclude that the jury would not have misunderstood McGuire‘s testimony or the\nState‘s comment to be a reference to a prior conviction.\n\n        Accordingly, we overrule appellant‘s Issue 1.\n\nIII.    Kansas Conviction for Aggravated Sexual Battery (Issues 4 and 5)\n\n        Appellant argues in Issues 4 and 5 that his 1992 Kansas conviction for aggravated\nsexual battery should not have been used to enhance his sentence because it does not\ncontain elements that are substantially similar to elements in any of the enhancement\noffenses listed in section 12.42(c)(2). See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.42(c)(2)(B).\n\n        Section 12.42 provides enhanced penalties for repeat felony offenders. Section\n12.42(c)(2) ―effectively creates a ‗two-strikes policy‘ for repeat sex offenders in Texas,\nembodying the legislature‘s intent to treat repeat sex offenders more harshly than other\nrepeat offenders.‖ Prudholm v.

Appellant argues in his brief: ―The Kansas statute addresses much less offensive\n\n                                             11\n\fconduct than any of the pertinent Texas statutes; a touching of the hair, arm, hand,\nforehead, or literally any part of the body is sufficient under the Kansas statute . . . .‖\nAppellant failed to object to the trial court‘s finding or the imposition of the enhanced\nsentence. Appellant therefore has failed to preserve this issue for review on appeal. See\nTEX. R. APP. P. 33.1.\n\n        Even if appellant had preserved this issue, we conclude that the elements listed in\nthe Kansas statute for aggravated sexual battery are substantially similar to the elements\nof the Texas offense of indecency with a child, one of the enhancement offenses listed in\nsection 12.42(c)(2)(B).\n\n        We review the trial court‘s ―substantially similar‖ finding de novo.

This ―high\ndegree of likeness‖ must involve more than similarity in merely ―a general sense.‖ See\nid. at 599. Secondly, ―the elements must be substantially similar with respect to the\nindividual or public interests protected and the impact of the elements on the seriousness\nof the offenses.‖ Id. at 595. With these considerations in mind, we turn to the elements\nrelevant to appellant‘s issues.\n\n        A.      “High Degree of Likeness”\n\n        Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense of aggravated sexual battery in Kansas on\nJune 26, 1992, based on the following allegations in the complaint:\n\n               [O]n or about the 5th day of May, 1992, [appellant] did then and\n        there unlawfully, willfully and feloniously touch the person of another, to-\n        7\n           Appellant first complains on appeal that the trial court‘s finding of ―mere similarity‖ does not\nconstitute a finding that the elements of the Kansas statute are substantially similar. Because we review\nthe trial court‘s use of the enhancement paragraph de novo, we need not decide whether the trial court‘s\narticulation of substantial similarity was sufficient.\n\n                                                    12\n\f        wit: M.M., a child under the age of sixteen (16) years, who was not the\n        spouse of the offender and who did not consent to the touching, with the\n        intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the offender.\n\nAggravated sexual battery was defined at that time, in relevant part, as ―sexual battery,‖\nor ―the intentional touching of the person of another . . . who is not the spouse of the\noffender and who does not consent thereto, with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual\ndesires of the offender or another,‖ against ―a person under 16 years of age.‖ KAN.

PENAL CODE\nANN. § 21.11(a)(1).8 ―Sexual contact‖ includes the following acts, ―if committed with\nthe intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person‖: (1) ―any touching by a\nperson . . . of the anus, breast, or any part of the genitals of a child‖; or (2) ―any touching\n\n        8\n          A person also commits an offense under this section if, with a child younger than 17 years of\nage, the person exposes the person‘s anus or any part of the person‘s genitals, knowing the child to be\npresent, or causes the child to expose the child‘s anus or any part of the child‘s genitals with the intent to\narouse or gratify the sexual desires of any person.

See Ex Parte\nWarren, — S.W.3d —, No. AP-76435, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4467224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 28,\n2011); Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 590.\n\n        In Prudholm, the court addressed the question of whether the elements of the\nCalifornia sexual battery statute are ―substantially similar‖ to the elements of the Texas\nsexual assault statute for enhancement purposes under section 12.42. The Prudholm\ncourt concluded that the elements are not ―substantially similar,‖ in part because the\n―touching‖ of an ―intimate part‖ relevant to California offense of sexual battery\n\n\n        9\n          The Kansas definition of sexual battery requires that the offense be against a person ―who is not\nthe spouse of the offender‖ as an element of the offense. See K.S.A. 1983 Supp. 21-3518. Similarly but\nnot identically, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution under the Texas statute if the actor was the\nspouse of the child at the time of the offense. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(b-1).\n        10\n           However, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution under the Texas Statute under certain\ncircumstances if the actor was not more than three years older than the victim and of the opposite sex, and\nthe actor did not use duress, force, or a threat against the victim at the time of the offense. See TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. § 21.11(b).\n\n                                                    14\n\fencompassed ―a markedly different range of conduct‖ than ―penetration or contact‖ of a\nperson‘s ―anus‖ or ―sexual organ‖ relevant to the Texas offense of sexual assault.\nPrudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 599.             However, the court also found that the following\nconsiderations indicated that the statutes were designed to address different offensive\nconduct, and therefore weighed against a finding of substantial similarity: (1) the\nCalifornia statute specifically excluded the more severe offenses of rape and sexual\npenetration from its definition of sexual battery, while the Texas sexual assault statute\npurposely encompasses those offenses; (2) the ―offensive contact‖ relevant to the\nCalifornia sexual battery statute was more akin to the offensive contact encompassed by\nthe Texas assault statute, rather than the ―severe physical and psychological trauma of\nrape‖ encompassed by the Texas sexual assault statute; and (3) sexual battery in\nCalifornia was a misdemeanor punishable by only six months imprisonment, while sexual\nassault in Texas is a second degree felony punishable by a sentence of up to 20 years\nimprisonment. Id.11\n\n       Warren involved a statute that permits the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\nto impose sex-offender conditions on an inmate‘s parole without prior notice or an\nopportunity to respond if the inmate has been convicted of an offense in another state that\ncontains elements that are ―substantially similar‖ to the elements of certain sex-related\noffenses.

The court in Warren concluded that the\nIllinois offense of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a child contained elements\nthat displayed a ―high degree of likeness‖ to the elements of the Texas offense of\nindecency with a child:\n\n               Both offenses involve sexual acts directed towards children: in the\n       Illinois statute, with ―any person under the age of 18‖; in the Texas statute,\n       ―with a child younger than 17 years of age[.]‖ Both offenses criminalize\n       similar sexual conduct with a child. The Illinois statue prohibits the ―lewd\n       11\n          The court did not address whether the California sexual battery statute contains elements that\nare substantially similar to the elements of the Texas offense of indecency with a child under section\n21.11.\n\n                                                  15\n\f       fondling or touching of [ . . . ] the child‖ and a ―lewd act done in the\n       presence of the child[.]‖ And the Texas statute prohibits ―engag[ing] in\n       sexual contact with the child‖ and ―expos[ing] the person‘s anus or any part\n       of the person‘s genitals[.]‖ Both statutes contain nearly the same mental\n       state. In the Illinois statute, the mens rea is ―with the intent to arouse or to\n       satisfy the sexual desires‖ of any person, while in the Texas, the mens rea is\n       ―with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person[.]‖ While\n       the elements of both statutes are not identical in every way, they are similar\n       enough to indicate a high degree of likeness and thus satisfy the first part of\n       the substantially similar test.\n\nWarren, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4467224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6.           We note that although it was not specifically\ndiscussed in Warren, the ―lewd fondling or touching‖ relevant to the Illinois statute, like\nthe touching relevant to the Kansas statue in this case, was not limited to the specific\nareas of the body identified in the Texas statute.

See\nPrudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 594. Additionally, the fact that an element of the Kansas\noffense would be insufficient to prove the respective Texas element is not determinative.\nSee id. at 594 n.15 (―For example, a Delaware defendant could be convicted for a\ntouching that was intended to be sexual in nature but was ultimately intended to\nembarrass or humiliate the victim, whereas such intent would not suffice under the Texas\nstatute to show an intent to arouse or gratify any person‘s sexual desire.‖ (discussing Ex\nparte White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1791437\"><a href=\"/opinion/1791437/ex-parte-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (Tex.

Unlike the differences at\nissue in Prudholm, the differences here are minor rather than major variations on the\nsame punishable conduct: the sexually-motivated touching of children. Like the offenses\nat issue in Warren, the elements of the offenses in this case display a ―high degree of\nlikeness‖ that goes beyond merely ―a general sense.‖ Warren, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4467224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6;\n\n\n                                             16\n\fPrudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 594, 599.\n\n       B.     Individual or Public Interests and the Seriousness of the Offenses\n\n       We next consider whether the elements are substantially similar ―with respect to\nthe individual or public interest protected and the impact of the elements on the\nseriousness of the offense.‖ See Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 595.\n\n       The individual and public interests protected by both statutes are clear: to\nsafeguard children from improper sexual conduct through sexually-motivated contact.\nThe Kansas statute furthered this goal by criminalizing the ―touching‖ of a child with the\nintent to arouse or satisfy sexual desire.        The Texas statute furthers this goal by\ncriminalizing ―sexual contact‖ with a child, which is defined more precisely as contact\nwith certain areas of the body, with the intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire.\n\n       This conclusion is bolstered by that fact that both offenses are felonies punishable\nby multiple-year sentence ranges, which indicates that both states similarly treat the\noffensive conduct with severity. See Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 595. Both offenses are\npunishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and a minimum sentence of two or three years.\nThat the Texas offense carries a maximum sentence of twenty years, while the Kansas\noffense carries a maximum sentence of ten years, is not so significant a difference that it\ndefeats a finding of substantial similarity. Compare id. at 599 (―[T]he difference in the\nsexual elements results in a much less serious California offense. . . . [S]exual battery is\na misdemeanor punishable by only six months imprisonment, while sexual assault is a\nsecond degree felony punishable by twenty years imprisonment.‖), with Warren, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4467224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (although punishment applicable almost forty years earlier was for a\nmisdemeanor offense with a sentence of less than one year and/or a fine of less than\n$1,000, contemporary punishment, which treats offensive conduct as felonious with a\nsentence of ―various ranges of terms of imprisonment,‖ supported finding of substantial\nsimilarity). We conclude that the elements of both offenses are ―substantially similar\nwith respect to the individual or public interests protected and the impact of the elements\non the seriousness of the offenses.‖ See Prudholm, 333 S.W.3d at 595.\n\n                                             17\n\f       Having found the elements of appellant‘s Kansas conviction to be ―substantially\nsimilar‖ to one of the enhancement offenses enumerated in 12.42(c)(2)(B), we overrule\nappellant‘s Issues 4 and 5.\n\nIV.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (Issues 2, 6–9)\n\n       In Issue 2 and Issues 6 through 9, appellant argues for the first time on appeal that\nhe was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel (1) failed to call\nany rebuttal witnesses in response to the ―uncorroborated testimony‖ of McGuire; (2)\nadvised appellant to plead ―true‖ to an enhancement paragraph that should not have been\nused; and (3) failed to object to the enhancement paragraph.\n\n       An ineffective assistance of counsel issue may be raised for the first time on direct\nappeal, although the record on such a direct appeal often will not be sufficient to show\nthat counsel was ineffective.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984).

Crim. App. 1999) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668). To\nestablish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) his counsel‘s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) but for counsel‘s\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id.\n\n       We assess whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel\naccording to the facts of each case. Id. at 813. Any allegation of ineffectiveness must be\nfirmly founded in the record, and the record must affirmatively demonstrate the alleged\nineffectiveness. Id. Appellant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\nevidence that counsel was ineffective. Id. We look to the totality of the representation\nand particular circumstances of each case in evaluating the effectiveness of counsel. Id.\nWe must be ―highly deferential to trial counsel and avoid the deleterious effects of\nhindsight.‖ Lane v.

Crim.\nApp. 2010). With these standards in mind, we turn to appellant‘s arguments.\n\n      A.     Rebuttal Witnesses\n\n      Appellant argues in Issue 2 that he was denied effective assistance of counsel\nbecause his trial counsel failed to call any rebuttal witnesses in response to the\n―uncorroborated testimony‖ of McGuire. Appellant states:\n\n              Appellant contends that he was not afforded effective assistance of\n      counsel due to trial counsel‘s failure to present any defense witnesses in\n      rebuttal of the testimony of [McGuire]. Appellant alleges that he informed\n      his trial counsel regarding the availability of said witnesses and requested\n      that the attorney subpoena said witnesses.\n             ....\n             Appellant‘s attorneys did not attempt to call any witnesses nor\n      produce any evidence to attack the credibility of [McGuire]. His testimony\n      went . . . unchallenged by the Appellant‘s trial attorneys. . . . [McGuire‘s]\n      other cell mates could have been called to show that there were over 40\n      other men in the jail tank and no private conversation between [McGuire\n      and appellant] were [sic] overheard by anyone.‖\n\nAn ineffective assistance claim can be premised upon an attorney‘s failure to present\nwitnesses only if the appellant can show that the witnesses were available and that their\ntestimony would have benefitted him. See Ex parte McFarland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685151\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685151/ex-parte-mcfarland/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757–58\n(Tex.

Likewise, he has\nfailed to show that these unnamed witnesses were available to testify or that their\ntestimony would have benefitted him.        Therefore, he fails to show prejudice.‖).\nAppellant has not made this showing. Moreover, counsel‘s reasons for not presenting\nsuch testimony do not appear in the record. See Garza v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2333417\"><a href=\"/opinion/2333417/garza-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348\n(Tex.

We overrule appellant‘s Issue 2 based on this argument.12\n\n        Although not captured by appellant‘s Issues Presented, appellant also complains in\nIssue 2 that his trial counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to object to the evidence and\narguments that allegedly constituted an implicit reference to appellant‘s Kansas\nconviction, as discussed in Issue 1; and (2) failing to object to and request an instruction\nregarding the ―uncorroborated‖ testimony of McGuire, as discussed in Issue 3. We have\nalready determined that even if appellant had made these objections, the trial court‘s\nactions were not error, or were harmless error.

Enhancement Paragraph\n\n        Appellant argues in Issues 6 through 9 that his trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to object and advising appellant to plead ―true‖ to the enhancement paragraph\ncontaining his Kansas conviction for aggravated sexual battery. Issues 6 through 9 each\ndepend on appellant‘s argument that the trial court‘s use of the enhancement paragraph\nunder section 12.42 was error, which is an argument that we rejected in overruling Issues\n4 and 5.
