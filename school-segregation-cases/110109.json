With him on the brief were\nStuart F. Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Ronald\nC. Machen Jr., U.S. Attorney, and Michael S. Raab, Attorney,\nU.S. Department of Justice.\n\f                               2\n\n   Before: SRINIVASAN, Circuit Judge, and EDWARDS and\nSENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n     Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge\nEDWARDS.\n\n    EDWARDS, Senior Circuit Judge: Electronic Frontier\nFoundation (“EFF”) appeals the District Court’s denial of its\nrequest under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”),\n5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq., for disclosure of a legal opinion (the\n“OLC Opinion”) prepared for the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (the “FBI”) by the Office of Legal Counsel\n(“OLC”) in the Department of Justice. Elec. Frontier Found. v.\nDep’t of Justice, 892 F. Supp. 2d 95 (D.D.C. 2012). The\nDistrict Court held that the OLC Opinion, in its entirety, is\nexempt from FOIA disclosure for two reasons. First, the\nDistrict Court held that the OLC Opinion is covered by the\n“deliberative process privilege” in FOIA Exemption 5, which\n“covers      ‘documents     reflecting    advisory    opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a\nprocess by which governmental decisions and policies are\nformulated.’” Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users\nProtective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (quoting NLRB v. Sears,\nRoebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)); 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(5). Second, the District Court concluded that portions\nof the OLC Opinion are exempt from disclosure under FOIA\nExemption 1 because they are “specifically authorized under\ncriteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in\nthe interest of national defense or foreign policy” and “are in\nfact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.”\nElec. Frontier Found., 982 F. Supp. 2d at 91-101 (citing 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(1)).\n\n   EFF contests the District Court’s holding that the OLC\nOpinion is covered by the deliberative process privilege. Br. of\nAppellant at 19-34. EFF argues further that, even if the OLC\nOpinion might have been covered by the deliberative process\n\f                                3\n\nprivilege, the FBI waived the privilege by relying on the OLC\nOpinion in dealings with Congress and the Office of the\nInspector General (the “OIG”). Id. at 34-37. Finally, EFF\nclaims that the District Court erred in failing to require the\nagency “to specify in detail which portions of the document are\ndisclosable and which are allegedly exempt” under\nExemption 1. Id. at 46 (quoting Kimberlin v. Dep’t of Justice,\n139 F.3d 944, 950 (D.C. Cir. 1998)), and that it also “erred by\nfailing to determine whether there was unclassified, factual\ninformation . . . that was ‘reasonably segregable’ from the\n[OLC] Opinion’s other content.” Id. at 50 (quoting 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)).\n\n    On the record before us, we hold that the OLC Opinion,\nwhich was requested by the FBI in response to the OIG’s\ninvestigation into its information-gathering techniques, is an\n“advisory opinion[], recommendation[] and deliberation[]\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated,” and is therefore covered by the\ndeliberative process privilege. Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S.\nat 8 (quotation omitted). We also hold that the FBI did not\n“adopt” the OLC Opinion and thereby waive the deliberative\nprocess privilege. The OIG mentioned the OLC Opinion in its\nreport, and a congressional committee inquired about the OLC\nOpinion, but the FBI never itself adopted the OLC Opinion’s\nreasoning as its own. Finally, because the entire OLC Opinion\nis exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process\nprivilege, we need not decide whether particular sections were\nproperly withheld as classified, or whether some material is\nreasonably segregable from the material properly withheld.\n\n                      I.    BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory Framework\n\n    FOIA requires government agencies to make available\n“final opinions . . . as well as orders,” “statements of policy and\n\f                                4\n\ninterpretations which have been adopted by the agency,” and\n“administrative staff manuals and instructions . . . that affect a\nmember of the public.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2). FOIA\nexemptions allow agencies to withhold information from\ndisclosure if it has been properly classified under criteria\nestablished by Executive order “to be kept secret in the interest\nof national defense or foreign policy,” id. § 552(b)(1)\n(Exemption 1), and “inter-agency or intra-agency\nmemorandums or letters which would not be available by law\nto a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,”\nid. § 552(b)(5) (Exemption 5). Exemption 5 covers material\nthat would be protected from disclosure in litigation under one\nof the recognized evidentiary or discovery privileges, such as\nthe attorney-client privilege. Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Office of\nMgmt. & Budget, 598 F.3d 865, 874 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citing\nCoastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854,\n862 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). The deliberative process privilege is one\nof the litigation privileges incorporated into Exemption 5. It\nallows an agency to withhold “all papers which reflect the\nagency’s group thinking in the process of working out its\npolicy and determining what its law shall be.” Sears, 421 U.S.\nat 153 (quotations omitted).\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n     Several statutes permit the FBI to use “national security\nletters” to subpoena telephone and financial records that it\ncertifies are connected to an authorized national security\ninvestigation. See Br. for Appellee at 4 (citing 12 U.S.C.\n§ 3414(a)(5)(A); 18 U.S.C. § 2709; 15 U.S.C. § 1681u(a)-(b);\n50 U.S.C. § 436(a)(1) (transferred to 50 U.S.C. § 3162)). The\nUSA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005\ndirected the OIG to audit the “effectiveness and use, including\nany improper or illegal use,” of these national security letters.\nPub. L. No. 109-177, § 119, 120 Stat. 192 (2006). The OIG’s\ninitial report found that the FBI had issued “exigent letters” to\nrequest records from telephone companies in cases in which\n\f                                5\n\nFBI officials had not certified that the records were part of an\nauthorized national security investigation, as required for a\nbona fide national security letter. U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE,\nOFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, A REVIEW OF THE\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION’S USE OF NATIONAL\nSECURITY         LETTERS          92        (March       2007),\nhttp://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0703b/final.pdf.\n\n    Following these findings, the OIG conducted a second\ninvestigation into the FBI’s use of exigent letters for requesting\ntelephone records. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, OFFICE OF THE\nINSPECTOR GENERAL, A REVIEW OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF\nINVESTIGATION’S USE OF EXIGENT LETTERS AND OTHER\nINFORMAL REQUESTS FOR TELEPHONE RECORDS (January\n2010)                                                       (“OIG\nReport”), www.justice.gov/oig/special/s1001r.pdf, reprinted\nin part in Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) 46. The OIG provided the\nFBI with a draft of this report. Valerie Caproni, General\nCounsel of the FBI, then sought legal advice from OLC about\nthe investigative tactics at issue. Decl. of Paul P. Colborn,\nSpecial Counsel in the Office of Legal Counsel at 4-5,\nreprinted in J.A. 21-22 (“Colborn Decl.”).\n\n   The OIG Report, which has been publicly disclosed,\nexplains that:\n\n    [A]fter reviewing a draft of the OIG report the FBI asked\n    the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) for a legal opinion on\n    this issue. . . . [T]he OLC agreed with the FBI that under\n    certain circumstances [redacted authority] allows the FBI\n    to ask for and obtain these records on a voluntary basis\n    from the providers, without legal process or a qualifying\n    emergency. . . . [T]he FBI acknowledged in its July 2009\n    comments to a draft of this report that it had never\n    considered or relied upon [redacted authority] when it\n    obtained any of the telephone records at issue in this\n    report. Moreover it cannot be known at this point whether\n\f                               6\n\n    any provider would have divulged such records based on\n    [redacted authority] alone, and without the FBI’s\n    representation that a[] [national security letter] or other\n    compulsory legal process would be served.\n\nOIG Report at 264-65, reprinted in J.A. 48-49. The OIG\nReport concluded that “the potential use of [redacted authority]\nby the FBI has important policy implications” and “creates a\nsignificant gap in FBI accountability and oversight that should\nbe examined closely by the FBI, the Department, and\nCongress.” Id. at 268, reprinted in J.A. 52. However, the OIG\nReport also acknowledged that “[t]he FBI has stated that it\ndoes not intend to rely on [redacted authority].” Id. at 265\nn.283, reprinted in J.A. 49.\n\n    On April 14, 2010, the House Subcommittee on the\nConstitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties held a hearing\nconcerning the OIG Report. As relevant to the OLC Opinion,\nFBI General Counsel Caproni testified:\n\n    The OIG’s 2010 report discusses a January 8, 2010\n    opinion issued by [OLC], which concluded that [the\n    Electronic Communications Privacy Act] does not forbid\n    electronic communications service providers, in certain\n    circumstances, from disclosing certain call detail records\n    to the FBI on a voluntary basis without legal process or a\n    qualifying emergency. Many members of Congress have\n    asked questions about this OLC opinion, which is\n    classified. It is my understanding that it has been shared\n    with our oversight committees, including this Committee,\n    at the appropriate security level. Because of the classified\n    nature of the OLC opinion, I cannot address it in this\n    forum, but am available to discuss it in a secure setting. I\n    can, however, state that the OLC opinion did not in any\n    way factor into the FBI’s flawed practice of using exigent\n    letters between 2003 and 2006 nor did it affect in any way\n    the records-retention decisions made by the FBI as part of\n\f                              7\n\n    the reconciliation project discussed above.\n\nThe Report of the Dep’t of Justice, OIG, Concerning the FBI’s\nuse of Exigent Letters and Other Informal Requests for\nTelephone Records: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the\nConstitution of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 111th Cong.\n(April 14, 2010) at 10, reprinted in J.A. 60, 70 (Statement of\nValerie E. Caproni, General Counsel, FBI) (“Caproni\nTestimony”).\n\n    On February 15, 2011, EFF submitted a FOIA request for\nthe OLC Opinion. Relying on FOIA Exemptions 1 and 5, the\nDepartment of Justice denied EFF’s request because the OLC\nOpinion contains classified information and is covered by the\ndeliberative process privilege. Letter from Paul P. Colborn,\nSpecial Counsel in OLC, to David L. Sobel (Feb. 25, 2011),\nreprinted in J.A. 30. EFF filed suit in District Court seeking\ndisclosure of the OLC Opinion. The Department of Justice\nsubmitted two affidavits in support of its motion for summary\njudgment: Paul Colborn, Special Counsel in OLC, declared\nthat the OLC Opinion is “pre-decisional and deliberative” in\nnature, and “disclosure . . . would undermine the deliberative\nprocesses of the government and chill the candid and frank\ncommunications necessary for effective decision-making.”\nColborn Decl. at 6, reprinted in J.A. 23. Colborn further\ndeclared that the OLC Opinion is also exempt from disclosure\ninsofar as it contains “content derived from confidential and\nclassified communications made by the FBI to OLC.” Id. at 5,\nreprinted in J.A. 22.\n\n    David Hardy, Section Chief of the Record/Information\nDissemination Section, Records Management Division, of the\nFBI, declared that portions of the OLC Opinion were properly\nclassified because “unauthorized disclosure of this information\n‘reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the\nnational security.’” Corrected Decl. of David M. Hardy at 5,\nreprinted in J.A. 33-44, 37 (quoting Exec. Order No. 13,526,\n\f                               8\n\nClassified National Security Information, § 1.1(a), 75 Fed.\nReg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009)). Hardy explained that the\ninformation contained in the OLC Opinion is “highly specific\nin nature and known to very few individuals,” it describes\nintelligence gathering techniques that the FBI presently uses,\nand disclosure “would allow hostile entities to discover the\ncurrent methods and activities used and . . . then develop\ncountermeasures which could severely disrupt the FBI’s\nintelligence-gathering capabilities.” Id. at 9, reprinted in J.A.\n41.\n\n    The District Court concluded that the OLC Opinion is\ncovered by the deliberative process privilege because it\n“contains inter-agency material that was generated as a\ncontinuous process of agency decision-making, namely how to\nrespond to the OIG’s critique of the FBI’s\ninformation-gathering methods.” 892 F. Supp. 2d at 103. The\nDistrict Court declined to rule on whether attorney-client\nprivilege also exempts the OLC Opinion from disclosure\nbecause the deliberative process privilege applies to all\nportions of the document that would be subject to the\nattorney-client privilege. Id. The District Court noted that the\nDepartment of Justice is “asserting Exemption 1 only as to\ncertain paragraphs of the OLC Opinion which have been\nmarked as classified in accordance with the classification\nmarkings included in the FBI’s two letters to OLC requesting\nlegal advice,” and it found the Department of Justice’s\ndeclarations sufficiently specific “to identify the records\nreferenced and understand the basic reasoning behind the\nclaimed exemptions.” Id. at 101 (quoting Morley v. CIA, 508\nF.3d 1108, 1123 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). The District Court\nconcluded that “no portion of the OLC Opinion is reasonably\nsegregable and releasable” because “the entirety of the OLC\nOpinion was withheld under Exemption 5, leaving nothing\nsignificant that could be disclosed in redacted format.” Id. at\n104.\n\f                               9\n\n                       II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n    We review decisions granting summary judgment in FOIA\ncases de novo. Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106,\n1111-12 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The agency bears the burden of\nshowing that a claimed exemption applies. Pub. Citizen, 598\nF.3d at 869 (citing Loving v. Dep’t of Def., 550 F.3d 32, 37\n(D.C. Cir. 2008)). Summary judgment is warranted when the\nagency’s affidavits “describe the justifications for\nnondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that\nthe information withheld logically falls within the claimed\nexemption, and are not controverted by either contrary\nevidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.”\nMiller v. Casey, 730 F.2d 773, 776 (D.C. Cir. 1984)\n(quotations omitted); Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857,\n862 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“Ultimately, an agency’s justification for\ninvoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears logical or\nplausible.” (quotations omitted)).\n\nB. Deliberative Process Privilege\n\n    The deliberative process privilege protects agencies from\nbeing “forced to operate in a fishbowl.” EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S.\n73, 87 (1973) (quotations omitted). And it applies when\n“production of the contested document would be injurious to\nthe consultative functions of government that the privilege of\nnondisclosure protects.” Id. (quotations omitted). The privilege\n“calls for disclosure of all opinions and interpretations which\nembody the agency’s effective law and policy, and the\nwithholding of all papers which reflect the agency’s group\nthinking in the process of working out its policy and\ndetermining what its law shall be.” Sears, 421 U.S. at 153\n(quotations omitted). The privilege is limited to documents\nthat are “predecisional” and “deliberative,” meaning “they\n‘reflect[] advisory opinions, recommendations, and\n\f                               10\n\ndeliberations comprising part of a process by which\ngovernmental decisions and policies are formulated, [or] the\npersonal opinions of the writer prior to the agency’s adoption\nof a policy.’” Pub. Citizen, 598 F.3d at 875 (quoting Taxation\nWith Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677 (D.C. Cir.\n1981)).\n\n    Importantly, the Supreme Court’s decision in Sears\nexplained that, under FOIA, agencies must disclose their\n“working law,” i.e. the “reasons which [supplied] the basis for\nan agency policy actually adopted.” 421 U.S. at 152-53. In\nother words, an agency is not permitted to develop “a body of\n‘secret law,’ used by it in the discharge of its regulatory duties\nand in its dealings with the public, but hidden behind a veil of\nprivilege because it is not designated as ‘formal,’ ‘binding,’ or\n‘final.’” Schlefer v. United States, 702 F.2d 233, 244 (D.C. Cir.\n1983) (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 867). Therefore, an\nagency must disclose “binding agency opinions and\ninterpretations” that the agency “actually applies in cases\nbefore it.” Id. (quoting Sterling Drug Inc. v. FTC, 450 F.2d\n698, 708 (D.C. Cir. 1971)).\n\n    In Sterling Drug, we required disclosure of memoranda\nprepared by the Federal Trade Commission to the extent that\nthey contained “orders and interpretations” that the\nCommission actually applied in a particular acquisition case.\n450 F.2d at 708. We explained that the deliberative process\nprivilege’s policy “of promoting the free flow of ideas within\nthe agency does not apply here, for private transmittals of\nbinding agency opinions and interpretations should not be\nencouraged.” Id. In Coastal States, we followed this principle\nto hold that memoranda from regional counsel to auditors in\nfield offices must be disclosed because the memoranda\n“represent[ed] interpretations of established policy on which\nthe agency relies in discharging its regulatory responsibilities.”\n617 F.2d at 869. Such interpretations “are not the ideas and\ntheories which go into the making of the law, they are the law\n\f                              11\n\nitself, and as such should be made available to the public.” Id.\nat 868 (quoting Sterling Drug, 450 F.2d at 708); accord\nSchlefer, 702 F.2d at 244 (holding that the privilege does not\nextend to opinions of the Chief Counsel of the Maritime\nAdministration interpreting statutes the agency administers\nbecause they “are authoritative Agency decisions in the cases\nto which they are addressed and . . . also guide subsequent\nAgency rulings”).\n\n    The same principle applied in Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117\nF.3d 607 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (Tax Analysts I), where we held that\nthe privilege did not cover advice memoranda from the Office\nof the Chief Counsel to field personnel providing legal\nguidance with respect to the situations of specific tax payers.\nId. at 609, 618. We explained that the “structure and purposes”\nof the system of issuing advisory memoranda to field\npersonnel “reveal that the national office, in issuing these\nmemoranda, is attempting to develop a body of coherent,\nconsistent interpretations of federal tax laws nationwide.” Id.\nat 617. Hence, even though the memoranda are “nominally\nnon-binding,” they are “considered statements of the agency’s\nlegal position.” Id. Reaching the same conclusion with respect\nto similar advice memoranda in Tax Analysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d\n71 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (Tax Analysts II), we noted that the\nmemoranda used language such as “[i]t is the position of the\nTreasury Department that . . .” and “[w]e conclude.” Id. at 81.\nWe explained that the “tone of these [memoranda] indicates\nthat they ‘simply explain and apply established policy.’” Id.\n(quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869).\n\n    In Public Citizen, we found that the deliberative process\nprivilege did not cover Office of Management and Budget\n(“OMB”) memoranda describing which agencies were\npermitted, by statute or by prior OMB practice, to submit their\nbudgetary materials to Congress without first clearing them\nwith OMB. 598 F.3d at 868. We found that these documents\n“determine OMB’s interaction with outsiders” and had\n\f                                12\n\n“real-world effects on the behavior of . . . agencies,” id. at 872;\nthe documents thus “reflect[ed] OMB’s formal or informal\npolicy” and “fit comfortably within the working law\nframework,” id. at 875.\n\n    None of the foregoing authorities is dispositive here,\nhowever, because OLC did not have the authority to establish\nthe “working law” of the FBI. OLC therefore did not “explain\nand apply established policy.” Tax Analysts II, 294 F.3d at 81\n(quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869). The OLC Opinion\ninstead amounts to advice offered by OLC for consideration by\nofficials of the FBI. Such a memorandum is not the law of an\nagency unless the agency adopts it. See Part C. infra.\n\n    The authorities that control the disposition of this case are\nthe decisions holding that the deliberative process privilege\ndoes cover legal memoranda that concern the advisability of a\nparticular policy, but do not authoritatively state or determine\nthe agency’s policy. For example, we have held exempt from\ndisclosure memoranda containing legal advice from the Legal\nAdviser to the Secretary of State “concerning United States\npolicy on issues involving” affairs in the Middle East. Brinton\nv. Dep’t of State, 636 F.2d 600, 602 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The court\nexplained that “[t]here can be no doubt that such legal advice,\ngiven in the form of intra-agency memoranda prior to any\nagency decision on the issues involved, fits exactly within the\ndeliberative process rationale for Exemption 5.” Id. at 604. The\nLegal Adviser’s “role is to give advice to those in the State\nDepartment who do make the policy decisions,” and, thus, the\n“flow of advisory material is exactly opposite of the paradigm\nof ‘final opinions,’ which typically flow from a superior with\npolicy-making authority to a subordinate who carries out the\npolicy.” Id. at 605 (citation omitted). In Murphy v. Dep’t of\nArmy, 613 F.2d 1151, 1154 (1979), this court held that the\nprivilege covers a memorandum from the Army General\nCounsel to Assistant Secretary providing advice on whether to\nenter a contract, because “[t]he Assistant Secretary who had\n\f                               13\n\ndecision-making power . . . sought advice from the general\ncounsel . . . on the legal questions raised.” (citations omitted)\n(emphasis added).\n\n    EFF argues that the OLC Opinion constituted the “working\nlaw” of the FBI because it “constituted ‘guidance’ used by [the\nagency] in [its] dealings with the public.” Br. of Appellant at\n29 (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869). The Government\ncounters that the FBI’s “[c]onsultation with legal advisers at\nthe Department of Justice constitutes precisely the sort of\n‘give-and-take of the consultative process’ that the deliberative\nprocess privilege was designed to protect.” Br. for Appellee at\n15 (quotations omitted). According to the Government, OLC’s\nOpinion is not the FBI’s “final decision about how, if at all, to\nalter its investigatory techniques,” because “th[is] decision was\nthe FBI’s to make after consulting with OLC and any other\nparts of the government it chose to involve in its policy-making\nprocess.” Id. (quotations omitted).\n\n    Because OLC cannot speak authoritatively on the FBI’s\npolicy, the OLC Opinion differs from memoranda we have\nfound to constitute the “working law” of an agency. In each of\nthese cases, to avoid the development of “secret law,” the\nagency was required to disclose a document that represented a\nconclusive or authoritative statement of its policy, usually a\nhigher authority instructing a subordinate on how the agency’s\ngeneral policy applies to a particular case, or a document that\ndetermined policy or applied established policy. In contrast,\nthe OLC Opinion is more similar to the advice from the Legal\nAdviser to the Secretary of State pertaining to policy in the\nMiddle East in Brinton, or the advice from the Army’s General\nCounsel pertaining to the advisability of a certain contract in\nMurphy. OLC is not authorized to make decisions about the\nFBI’s investigative policy, so the OLC Opinion cannot be an\nauthoritative statement of the agency’s policy. See Colborn\nDecl. at 1-2, reprinted in J.A. 18-19 (“OLC does not purport,\nand in fact lacks authority, to make policy decisions. OLC’s\n\f                                14\n\nlegal advice and analysis may inform the decisionmaking of\nExecutive Branch officials on matters of policy, but OLC’s\nlegal advice is not itself dispositive as to any policy adopted.”).\n\n    EFF argues that the OLC Opinion must be “working law”\nbecause it is controlling (insofar as agencies customarily\nfollow OLC advice that they request), precedential, and can be\nwithdrawn. Br. of Appellant at 22-24, 30-34. That the OLC\nOpinion bears these indicia of a binding legal decision does not\novercome the fact that OLC does not speak with authority on\nthe FBI’s policy; therefore, the OLC Opinion could not be the\n“working law” of the FBI unless the FBI “adopted” what OLC\noffered. In Brinton, we rejected the appellant’s claim that\nmemoranda must be released because they constituted the\n“final opinions” of the Department of State. We explained that\nwhile the privilege does not protect final decisions or\nauthoritative statements on agency policy, the “final opinions”\nof the Department of State’s Legal Adviser, “who has no\nauthority to make final decisions concerning United States\npolicy in the Middle East,” are not final decisions of the\nDepartment of State. 636 F.2d at 605. The same is true of the\nOLC Opinion in this case.\n\n     Even if the OLC Opinion describes the legal parameters of\nwhat the FBI is permitted to do, it does not state or determine\nthe FBI’s policy. The FBI was free to decline to adopt the\ninvestigative tactics deemed legally permissible in the OLC\nOpinion. Indeed, the OIG’s report acknowledged that the FBI\nhad “declined, for the time being, to rely on the authority\ndiscussed in the OLC Opinion.” Br. for Appellee at 15-16\n(citing OIG Report at 265 n.283, reprinted in J.A. 49). The\nOLC Opinion does not provide an authoritative statement of\nthe FBI’s policy. It merely examines policy options available\nto the FBI. Therefore, the OLC Opinion is not the “working\nlaw” of the FBI.\n\n    On this record, we hold that the OLC Opinion reflects\n\f                               15\n\nprecisely the sort of “advisory opinion . . . comprising part of a\nprocess by which governmental decisions and policies are\nformulated” that is covered by the deliberative process\nprivilege. Pub. Citizen, 598 F.3d at 875 (quotations omitted);\naccord Brennan Ctr. for Justice at New York Univ. Sch. of Law\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 697 F.3d 184, 203 (2d Cir. 2012)\n(“The [OLC] Memorandum does not constitute working law,\nor the agency’s effective law and policy.” (quotations\nomitted)); Nat’l Council of La Raza v. Dep’t of Justice, 411\nF.3d 350, 356 n.4 (2d Cir. 2005) (presuming OLC\nmemorandum satisfies requirements of deliberative process\nprivilege).\n\nC. Waiver by Public Adoption or Reliance\n\n    In Sears, the Court explained that Exemption 5 does not\napply “if an agency chooses expressly to adopt or incorporate\nby reference” a memorandum that would have otherwise been\nprotected by the privilege. 421 U.S. at 161 (“[W]hen adopted,\nthe reasoning becomes that of the agency and becomes its\nresponsibility to defend.”). The same day Sears was decided,\nthe Court also held in Renegotiation Bd. v. Grumman Aircraft\nEng’g Corp., that the “adoption” exception to Exemption 5 did\nnot apply to reports addressing whether government\ncontractors were required to refund excessive profits under\ntheir contracts, even though the agency’s decision agreed with\nthe reports’ conclusion. The decision clarified that in order for\nthe exception to apply, it must be evident that “the reasoning in\nthe report is adopted by the [agency] as its reasoning, even\nwhen [the agency’s decision] agrees with the conclusion of a\nreport.” 421 U.S. 168, 184 (1975).\n\n    We have thus recognized that “the Court has refused to\nequate reference to a report’s conclusions with adoption of its\nreasoning, and it is the latter that destroys the privilege.”\nAccess Reports v. Dep’t of Justice, 926 F.2d 1192, 1197 (D.C.\nCir. 1991) (a department head’s “confused statement” in\n\f                               16\n\ntestimony before a Senate committee that might be read as a\nreference to the privileged document “fell far short of the\nexpress adoption required by Sears”); Common Cause v. IRS,\n646 F.2d 656, 660 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“[C]asual allusion in a\npost-decisional document to subject matter discussed in some\npre-decisional, intra-agency memoranda is not the express\nadoption or incorporation by reference which . . . would\nremove the protection of Exemption 5.”). These decisions\nstand in contrast to Afshar v. Dep’t of State, 702 F.2d 1125,\n1140 (D.C. Cir. 1983), where the court held that when\n“predecisional recommendations . . . are expressly adopted in\n[a] final, nonexempt memorandum, . . . ‘the reasoning becomes\nthat of the agency and becomes its responsibility to defend.’”\nId. at 1142 (quoting Sears, 421 U.S. at 161) (emphasis in\nSears). In this case, EFF cannot point to any evidence\nsupporting its claim that the FBI expressly adopted the OLC\nOpinion as its reasoning.\n\n    EFF argues that the FBI “adopted” the OLC Opinion by\n“approving[] public references in non-privileged agency\ndocuments (like the OIG report) and reliance in congressional\ntestimony.” Br. of Appellant at 36. EFF relies on two decisions\nin which the Second Circuit held that an agency waived the\nprivilege by referencing an OLC memorandum in its dealings\nwith the public. Id. (citing Brennan Ctr., 697 F.3d at 204; La\nRaza, 411 F.3d at 357). But these cases are inapposite because,\nin each one, the agency itself publicly invoked the reasoning of\nthe OLC memorandum to justify its new position.\n\n    In La Raza, the court found that the “Attorney General and\nhis high-level staff made a practice of using the OLC\nMemorandum to justify and explain the Department [of\nJustice]’s policy and to assure the public and the very state and\nlocal government officials who would be asked to implement\nthe new policy that the policy was legally sound.” 411 F.3d at\n358. In Brennan Center, a U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment guidance document referenced an OLC Opinion\n\f                              17\n\nas a basis for exempting U.S. non-governmental organizations\nfrom a requirement to pledge to oppose sex trafficking in order\nto receive aid. 697 F.3d at 191. And when the agency changed\nthis policy, a director explained during Congressional hearings\nthat OLC had changed its position, and he was “simply\nfollowing . . . the advice” of OLC. Id. at 192 (quotations\nomitted).\n\n    This case differs from the cases cited by EFF because the\npublic references to the OLC Opinion did not come from the\nFBI itself. Rather, the public references originated from the\nOIG and Congress. The OIG mentioned the OLC Opinion in\nits Report and Caproni was asked about it by members of\nCongress. However, the FBI never itself publicly invoked or\nrelied upon the contents of the OLC Opinion. Grumman\nexplained that the adoption exception only applies if “the\nreasoning in the [privileged document] is adopted by the\n[agency] as its reasoning.” 421 U.S. at 184 (emphasis added).\nThe OIG’s references to the OLC Opinion do not establish that\nthe FBI adopted the OLC Opinion as its own reasoning. Nor\ndoes Caproni’s response to inquiries from members of\nCongress establish that the FBI adopted the OLC Opinion’s\nreasoning as its own. Colborn explained that the OLC Opinion\n“has not been made public, and to the extent that it has been\nshared with others in the Government, these individuals would\n. . . only have been persons with an appropriate security\nclearance and a need to know—that is, individuals whose job\nresponsibilities related to national security.” Colborn Decl. at\n6, reprinted in J.A. 23. Colborn made it clear that anyone who\nviewed the OLC Opinion “would have understood the need for\nconfidentiality.” Id.\n\n   When Caproni mentioned the OLC Opinion during\ncongressional hearings, she noted that “[m]any members of\nCongress have asked questions about this OLC opinion.”\nCaproni Testimony at 10, reprinted in J.A. 70. In other words,\nCaproni referenced the OLC Opinion in response to inquiries,\n\f                               18\n\nrather than affirmatively raising it to justify the FBI’s policy.\nCaproni’s testimony thus differs from the communications in\nAfshar, the congressional testimony in Brennan Center, and\nthe statements in La Raza. In Afshar, the court found that the\ndisputed memoranda in that case were predecisional when\nwritten, but the recommendations that they contained were not\nprotected by the deliberative process privilege once they were\n“expressly adopted as the basis for agency action.” 702 F.2d at\n1140. In Brennan Center, a director of the agency explained\nthat he changed positions “following” advice of OLC, and\ndescribed that advice. 697 F.3d at 192. In La Raza, the District\nCourt found that the Department of Justice had, “through the\npublic statements of its representatives, incorporated the OLC\nMemorandum into Department policy.” 411 F.3d at 355. In\ncontrast, Caproni never claimed that the FBI’s investigative\ntactics were justified by the OLC Opinion. To the contrary, she\nactually disavowed reliance on the OLC Opinion, stating that it\n“did not in any way factor into the FBI’s flawed practice of\nusing exigent letters between 2003 and 2006 nor did it affect in\nany way the records-retention decisions made by the FBI as\npart of the reconciliation project.” Caproni Testimony at 10,\nreprinted in J.A. 70. Far from publicly using the OLC Opinion\nto justify the FBI’s position, Caproni’s testimony indicates that\nthe OLC Opinion did not determine the FBI’s actions or\npolicy.\n\nD. Segregability\n\n    It is undisputed that under FOIA non-exempt information\nthat is “reasonably segregable” from exempt information must\nbe disclosed. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). EFF contends that the District\nCourt “erred by failing to determine whether there was\nunclassified, factual information within the OLC Opinion that\nwas ‘reasonably segregable’ from the Opinion’s other\ncontent.” Br. for Appellant at 50. We disagree. In a section\nentitled “Segregability,” the District Court specifically held\nthat “the Department has sufficiently established that no\n\f                               19\n\nportion of the OLC Opinion is reasonably segregable and\nreleasable.” 892 F. Supp. 2d at 104. This holding is supported\nby the record. See Colborn Decl. at 5-7, reprinted in J.A.\n22-24.\n\n    In pressing its claim for segregability, EFF relies on Loving\nv. Dep’t of Defense for the proposition that “the deliberative\nprocess privilege does not protect documents in their entirety;\nif the government can segregate and disclose non-privileged\nfactual information within a document, it must.” 550 F.3d 32,\n38 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Army Times Publ’g Co. v. Dep’t of\nAir Force, 998 F.2d 1067, 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). In response,\nthe Government points out that:\n\n    The OLC declarant explained that “[t]hose portions of the\n    Opinion that are marked unclassified reflect other\n    confidential factual as well as confidential legal\n    communications provided by the FBI to OLC for the\n    purpose of obtaining legal advice.” This statement\n    confirms that the entire document reflects the full and\n    frank exchange of ideas between the FBI and OLC, and\n    that revealing portions of the document would reveal the\n    substance of those privileged communications.\n\nBr. for Appellee at 40 (quoting Colborn Decl. at 5-6, reprinted\nin J.A. 22-23 (emphasis added)).\n\n    We agree with the Government that EFF has “ignor[ed] the\ncontext in which factual statements were made [in asserting]\nthat ‘factual material cannot generally be withheld under the\ndeliberative process privilege.’” Id. (quoting Br. for Appellant\nat 51). In other words, because context matters, the proposition\nadvanced by EFF is not inviolate. This point was made clear by\nthe en banc court in Wolfe v. Dep’t of Health and Human Serv.,\n839 F.2d 768 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In Wolfe, we explained that\n\n    [i]n some circumstances, even material that could be\n\f                              20\n\n    characterized as “factual” would so expose the\n    deliberative process that it must be covered by the\n    privilege. We know of no case in which a court has used\n    the fact/opinion distinction to support disclosure of facts\n    about the inner workings of the deliberative process itself.\n\nId. at 774 (citation omitted); accord In re Sealed Case, 121\nF.3d 729, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (“The deliberative process\nprivilege does not shield . . . material that is purely factual,\nunless the material is so inextricably intertwined with the\ndeliberative sections of documents that its disclosure would\ninevitably reveal the government's deliberations.”).\n\n    Based on the declarations provided by the Government, the\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that “the unclassified\nportions of the OLC Opinion could not be released without\nharming the deliberative processes of the government by\nchilling the candid and frank communications necessary for\neffective governmental decision-making.” 892 F. Supp. 2d at\n104 (citation, quotations, and alterations omitted). The\nreasoning in Wolfe is thus controlling here.\n\nE. Exemption 1\n\n    Because we find that the entire OLC Opinion is exempt\nfrom disclosure under the deliberative process privilege, there\nis no need for this court to determine whether certain portions\nof the OLC Opinion were properly withheld as classified under\nExemption 1.\n\n                     III.   CONCLUSION\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.\n\f",

The\nDistrict Court held that the OLC Opinion, in its entirety, is\nexempt from FOIA disclosure for two reasons. First, the\nDistrict Court held that the OLC Opinion is covered by the\n“deliberative process privilege” in FOIA Exemption 5, which\n“covers      ‘documents     reflecting    advisory    opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a\nprocess by which governmental decisions and policies are\nformulated.’” Dep’t of Interior v.

Second, the District Court concluded that portions\nof the OLC Opinion are exempt from disclosure under FOIA\nExemption 1 because they are “specifically authorized under\ncriteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in\nthe interest of national defense or foreign policy” and “are in\nfact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.”\nElec. Frontier Found., 982 F. Supp. 2d at 91-101 (citing 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(1)).\n\n   EFF contests the District Court’s holding that the OLC\nOpinion is covered by the deliberative process privilege. Br. of\nAppellant at 19-34. EFF argues further that, even if the OLC\nOpinion might have been covered by the deliberative process\n\f                                3\n\nprivilege, the FBI waived the privilege by relying on the OLC\nOpinion in dealings with Congress and the Office of the\nInspector General (the “OIG”). Id. at 34-37. Finally, EFF\nclaims that the District Court erred in failing to require the\nagency “to specify in detail which portions of the document are\ndisclosable and which are allegedly exempt” under\nExemption 1. Id. at 46 (quoting Kimberlin v. Dep’t of Justice,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184504\"><a href=\"/opinion/184504/kimberlin-brett-c-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950 (D.C. Cir. 1998)), and that it also “erred by\nfailing to determine whether there was unclassified, factual\ninformation . . . that was ‘reasonably segregable’ from the\n[OLC] Opinion’s other content.” Id. at 50 (quoting 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)).\n\n    On the record before us, we hold that the OLC Opinion,\nwhich was requested by the FBI in response to the OIG’s\ninvestigation into its information-gathering techniques, is an\n“advisory opinion[], recommendation[] and deliberation[]\ncomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated,” and is therefore covered by the\ndeliberative process privilege. Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S.\nat 8 (quotation omitted). We also hold that the FBI did not\n“adopt” the OLC Opinion and thereby waive the deliberative\nprocess privilege. The OIG mentioned the OLC Opinion in its\nreport, and a congressional committee inquired about the OLC\nOpinion, but the FBI never itself adopted the OLC Opinion’s\nreasoning as its own. Finally, because the entire OLC Opinion\nis exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process\nprivilege, we need not decide whether particular sections were\nproperly withheld as classified, or whether some material is\nreasonably segregable from the material properly withheld.\n\n                      I.    BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory Framework\n\n    FOIA requires government agencies to make available\n“final opinions . . . as well as orders,” “statements of policy and\n\f                                4\n\ninterpretations which have been adopted by the agency,” and\n“administrative staff manuals and instructions . . . that affect a\nmember of the public.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2). FOIA\nexemptions allow agencies to withhold information from\ndisclosure if it has been properly classified under criteria\nestablished by Executive order “to be kept secret in the interest\nof national defense or foreign policy,” id. § 552(b)(1)\n(Exemption 1), and “inter-agency or intra-agency\nmemorandums or letters which would not be available by law\nto a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,”\nid. § 552(b)(5) (Exemption 5). Exemption 5 covers material\nthat would be protected from disclosure in litigation under one\nof the recognized evidentiary or discovery privileges, such as\nthe attorney-client privilege. Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Office of\nMgmt. & Budget, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1225016\"><a href=\"/opinion/1225016/public-citizen-inc-v-office-of-mgmt-and-budget/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874 (D.C.

Cir. 1980)). The deliberative process privilege is one\nof the litigation privileges incorporated into Exemption 5. It\nallows an agency to withhold “all papers which reflect the\nagency’s group thinking in the process of working out its\npolicy and determining what its law shall be.” Sears, 421 U.S.\nat 153 (quotations omitted).\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n     Several statutes permit the FBI to use “national security\nletters” to subpoena telephone and financial records that it\ncertifies are connected to an authorized national security\ninvestigation. See Br. for Appellee at 4 (citing 12 U.S.C.\n§ 3414(a)(5)(A); 18 U.S.C. § 2709; 15 U.S.C. § 1681u(a)-(b);\n50 U.S.C. § 436(a)(1) (transferred to 50 U.S.C. § 3162)). The\nUSA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005\ndirected the OIG to audit the “effectiveness and use, including\nany improper or illegal use,” of these national security letters.\nPub. L. No. 109-177, § 119, 120 Stat. 192 (2006). The OIG’s\ninitial report found that the FBI had issued “exigent letters” to\nrequest records from telephone companies in cases in which\n\f                                5\n\nFBI officials had not certified that the records were part of an\nauthorized national security investigation, as required for a\nbona fide national security letter.

The OIG provided the\nFBI with a draft of this report. Valerie Caproni, General\nCounsel of the FBI, then sought legal advice from OLC about\nthe investigative tactics at issue. Decl. of Paul P. Colborn,\nSpecial Counsel in the Office of Legal Counsel at 4-5,\nreprinted in J.A. 21-22 (“Colborn Decl.”).\n\n   The OIG Report, which has been publicly disclosed,\nexplains that:\n\n    [A]fter reviewing a draft of the OIG report the FBI asked\n    the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) for a legal opinion on\n    this issue. . . . [T]he OLC agreed with the FBI that under\n    certain circumstances [redacted authority] allows the FBI\n    to ask for and obtain these records on a voluntary basis\n    from the providers, without legal process or a qualifying\n    emergency. . . . [T]he FBI acknowledged in its July 2009\n    comments to a draft of this report that it had never\n    considered or relied upon [redacted authority] when it\n    obtained any of the telephone records at issue in this\n    report. Moreover it cannot be known at this point whether\n\f                               6\n\n    any provider would have divulged such records based on\n    [redacted authority] alone, and without the FBI’s\n    representation that a[] [national security letter] or other\n    compulsory legal process would be served.\n\nOIG Report at 264-65, reprinted in J.A. 48-49. The OIG\nReport concluded that “the potential use of [redacted authority]\nby the FBI has important policy implications” and “creates a\nsignificant gap in FBI accountability and oversight that should\nbe examined closely by the FBI, the Department, and\nCongress.” Id. at 268, reprinted in J.A. 52. However, the OIG\nReport also acknowledged that “[t]he FBI has stated that it\ndoes not intend to rely on [redacted authority].” Id. at 265\nn.283, reprinted in J.A. 49.\n\n    On April 14, 2010, the House Subcommittee on the\nConstitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties held a hearing\nconcerning the OIG Report. As relevant to the OLC Opinion,\nFBI General Counsel Caproni testified:\n\n    The OIG’s 2010 report discusses a January 8, 2010\n    opinion issued by [OLC], which concluded that [the\n    Electronic Communications Privacy Act] does not forbid\n    electronic communications service providers, in certain\n    circumstances, from disclosing certain call detail records\n    to the FBI on a voluntary basis without legal process or a\n    qualifying emergency. Many members of Congress have\n    asked questions about this OLC opinion, which is\n    classified. It is my understanding that it has been shared\n    with our oversight committees, including this Committee,\n    at the appropriate security level. Because of the classified\n    nature of the OLC opinion, I cannot address it in this\n    forum, but am available to discuss it in a secure setting. I\n    can, however, state that the OLC opinion did not in any\n    way factor into the FBI’s flawed practice of using exigent\n    letters between 2003 and 2006 nor did it affect in any way\n    the records-retention decisions made by the FBI as part of\n\f                              7\n\n    the reconciliation project discussed above.\n\nThe Report of the Dep’t of Justice, OIG, Concerning the FBI’s\nuse of Exigent Letters and Other Informal Requests for\nTelephone Records: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the\nConstitution of the H.

Caproni, General Counsel, FBI) (“Caproni\nTestimony”).\n\n    On February 15, 2011, EFF submitted a FOIA request for\nthe OLC Opinion. Relying on FOIA Exemptions 1 and 5, the\nDepartment of Justice denied EFF’s request because the OLC\nOpinion contains classified information and is covered by the\ndeliberative process privilege. Letter from Paul P. Colborn,\nSpecial Counsel in OLC, to David L. Sobel (Feb. 25, 2011),\nreprinted in J.A. 30. EFF filed suit in District Court seeking\ndisclosure of the OLC Opinion. The Department of Justice\nsubmitted two affidavits in support of its motion for summary\njudgment: Paul Colborn, Special Counsel in OLC, declared\nthat the OLC Opinion is “pre-decisional and deliberative” in\nnature, and “disclosure . . . would undermine the deliberative\nprocesses of the government and chill the candid and frank\ncommunications necessary for effective decision-making.”\nColborn Decl. at 6, reprinted in J.A. 23. Colborn further\ndeclared that the OLC Opinion is also exempt from disclosure\ninsofar as it contains “content derived from confidential and\nclassified communications made by the FBI to OLC.” Id. at 5,\nreprinted in J.A. 22.\n\n    David Hardy, Section Chief of the Record/Information\nDissemination Section, Records Management Division, of the\nFBI, declared that portions of the OLC Opinion were properly\nclassified because “unauthorized disclosure of this information\n‘reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the\nnational security.’” Corrected Decl. of David M. Hardy at 5,\nreprinted in J.A. 33-44, 37 (quoting Exec. Order No. 13,526,\n\f                               8\n\nClassified National Security Information, § 1.1(a), 75 Fed.\nReg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009)). Hardy explained that the\ninformation contained in the OLC Opinion is “highly specific\nin nature and known to very few individuals,” it describes\nintelligence gathering techniques that the FBI presently uses,\nand disclosure “would allow hostile entities to discover the\ncurrent methods and activities used and . . . then develop\ncountermeasures which could severely disrupt the FBI’s\nintelligence-gathering capabilities.” Id. at 9, reprinted in J.A.\n41.\n\n    The District Court concluded that the OLC Opinion is\ncovered by the deliberative process privilege because it\n“contains inter-agency material that was generated as a\ncontinuous process of agency decision-making, namely how to\nrespond to the OIG’s critique of the FBI’s\ninformation-gathering methods.” 892 F. Supp. 2d at 103. The\nDistrict Court declined to rule on whether attorney-client\nprivilege also exempts the OLC Opinion from disclosure\nbecause the deliberative process privilege applies to all\nportions of the document that would be subject to the\nattorney-client privilege. Id. The District Court noted that the\nDepartment of Justice is “asserting Exemption 1 only as to\ncertain paragraphs of the OLC Opinion which have been\nmarked as classified in accordance with the classification\nmarkings included in the FBI’s two letters to OLC requesting\nlegal advice,” and it found the Department of Justice’s\ndeclarations sufficiently specific “to identify the records\nreferenced and understand the basic reasoning behind the\nclaimed exemptions.” Id. at 101 (quoting Morley v.

The District Court\nconcluded that “no portion of the OLC Opinion is reasonably\nsegregable and releasable” because “the entirety of the OLC\nOpinion was withheld under Exemption 5, leaving nothing\nsignificant that could be disclosed in redacted format.” Id. at\n104.\n\f                               9\n\n                       II.

Summary judgment is warranted when the\nagency’s affidavits “describe the justifications for\nnondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that\nthe information withheld logically falls within the claimed\nexemption, and are not controverted by either contrary\nevidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.”\nMiller v.

Deliberative Process Privilege\n\n    The deliberative process privilege protects agencies from\nbeing “forced to operate in a fishbowl.” EPA v. Mink, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108712\"><a href=\"/opinion/108712/epa-v-mink/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1973) (quotations omitted). And it applies when\n“production of the contested document would be injurious to\nthe consultative functions of government that the privilege of\nnondisclosure protects.” Id. (quotations omitted). The privilege\n“calls for disclosure of all opinions and interpretations which\nembody the agency’s effective law and policy, and the\nwithholding of all papers which reflect the agency’s group\nthinking in the process of working out its policy and\ndetermining what its law shall be.” Sears, 421 U.S. at 153\n(quotations omitted). The privilege is limited to documents\nthat are “predecisional” and “deliberative,” meaning “they\n‘reflect[] advisory opinions, recommendations, and\n\f                               10\n\ndeliberations comprising part of a process by which\ngovernmental decisions and policies are formulated, [or] the\npersonal opinions of the writer prior to the agency’s adoption\nof a policy.’” Pub. Citizen, 598 F.3d at 875 (quoting Taxation\nWith Representation Fund v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389460\"><a href=\"/opinion/389460/taxation-with-representation-fund-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677 (D.C. Cir.\n1981)).\n\n    Importantly, the Supreme Court’s decision in Sears\nexplained that, under FOIA, agencies must disclose their\n“working law,” i.e. the “reasons which [supplied] the basis for\nan agency policy actually adopted.” 421 U.S. at 152-53. In\nother words, an agency is not permitted to develop “a body of\n‘secret law,’ used by it in the discharge of its regulatory duties\nand in its dealings with the public, but hidden behind a veil of\nprivilege because it is not designated as ‘formal,’ ‘binding,’ or\n‘final.’” Schlefer v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415475\"><a href=\"/opinion/415475/mark-p-schlefer-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (D.C. Cir.\n1983) (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 867). Therefore, an\nagency must disclose “binding agency opinions and\ninterpretations” that the agency “actually applies in cases\nbefore it.” Id. (quoting Sterling Drug Inc. v. FTC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"299812\"><a href=\"/opinion/299812/sterling-drug-inc-v-federal-trade-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (D.C. Cir. 1971)).\n\n    In Sterling Drug, we required disclosure of memoranda\nprepared by the Federal Trade Commission to the extent that\nthey contained “orders and interpretations” that the\nCommission actually applied in a particular acquisition case.\n450 F.2d at 708. We explained that the deliberative process\nprivilege’s policy “of promoting the free flow of ideas within\nthe agency does not apply here, for private transmittals of\nbinding agency opinions and interpretations should not be\nencouraged.” Id. In Coastal States, we followed this principle\nto hold that memoranda from regional counsel to auditors in\nfield offices must be disclosed because the memoranda\n“represent[ed] interpretations of established policy on which\nthe agency relies in discharging its regulatory responsibilities.”\n617 F.2d at 869. Such interpretations “are not the ideas and\ntheories which go into the making of the law, they are the law\n\f                              11\n\nitself, and as such should be made available to the public.” Id.\nat 868 (quoting Sterling Drug, 450 F.2d at 708); accord\nSchlefer, 702 F.2d at 244 (holding that the privilege does not\nextend to opinions of the Chief Counsel of the Maritime\nAdministration interpreting statutes the agency administers\nbecause they “are authoritative Agency decisions in the cases\nto which they are addressed and . . . also guide subsequent\nAgency rulings”).\n\n    The same principle applied in Tax Analysts v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743062\"><a href=\"/opinion/743062/tax-analysts-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1997) (Tax Analysts I), where we held that\nthe privilege did not cover advice memoranda from the Office\nof the Chief Counsel to field personnel providing legal\nguidance with respect to the situations of specific tax payers.\nId. at 609, 618. We explained that the “structure and purposes”\nof the system of issuing advisory memoranda to field\npersonnel “reveal that the national office, in issuing these\nmemoranda, is attempting to develop a body of coherent,\nconsistent interpretations of federal tax laws nationwide.” Id.\nat 617. Hence, even though the memoranda are “nominally\nnon-binding,” they are “considered statements of the agency’s\nlegal position.” Id. Reaching the same conclusion with respect\nto similar advice memoranda in Tax Analysts v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778068\"><a href=\"/opinion/778068/tax-analysts-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2002) (Tax Analysts II), we noted that the\nmemoranda used language such as “[i]t is the position of the\nTreasury Department that . . .” and “[w]e conclude.” Id. at 81.\nWe explained that the “tone of these [memoranda] indicates\nthat they ‘simply explain and apply established policy.’” Id.\n(quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869).\n\n    In Public Citizen, we found that the deliberative process\nprivilege did not cover Office of Management and Budget\n(“OMB”) memoranda describing which agencies were\npermitted, by statute or by prior OMB practice, to submit their\nbudgetary materials to Congress without first clearing them\nwith OMB. 598 F.3d at 868. We found that these documents\n“determine OMB’s interaction with outsiders” and had\n\f                                12\n\n“real-world effects on the behavior of . . . agencies,” id. at 872;\nthe documents thus “reflect[ed] OMB’s formal or informal\npolicy” and “fit comfortably within the working law\nframework,” id. at 875.\n\n    None of the foregoing authorities is dispositive here,\nhowever, because OLC did not have the authority to establish\nthe “working law” of the FBI. OLC therefore did not “explain\nand apply established policy.” Tax Analysts II, 294 F.3d at 81\n(quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869). The OLC Opinion\ninstead amounts to advice offered by OLC for consideration by\nofficials of the FBI. Such a memorandum is not the law of an\nagency unless the agency adopts it. See Part C. infra.\n\n    The authorities that control the disposition of this case are\nthe decisions holding that the deliberative process privilege\ndoes cover legal memoranda that concern the advisability of a\nparticular policy, but do not authoritatively state or determine\nthe agency’s policy. For example, we have held exempt from\ndisclosure memoranda containing legal advice from the Legal\nAdviser to the Secretary of State “concerning United States\npolicy on issues involving” affairs in the Middle East. Brinton\nv. Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384942\"><a href=\"/opinion/384942/william-m-brinton-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 602 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The court\nexplained that “[t]here can be no doubt that such legal advice,\ngiven in the form of intra-agency memoranda prior to any\nagency decision on the issues involved, fits exactly within the\ndeliberative process rationale for Exemption 5.” Id. at 604. The\nLegal Adviser’s “role is to give advice to those in the State\nDepartment who do make the policy decisions,” and, thus, the\n“flow of advisory material is exactly opposite of the paradigm\nof ‘final opinions,’ which typically flow from a superior with\npolicy-making authority to a subordinate who carries out the\npolicy.” Id. at 605 (citation omitted). In Murphy v. Dep’t of\nArmy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373875\"><a href=\"/opinion/373875/timothy-r-murphy-v-department-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154 (1979), this court held that the\nprivilege covers a memorandum from the Army General\nCounsel to Assistant Secretary providing advice on whether to\nenter a contract, because “[t]he Assistant Secretary who had\n\f                               13\n\ndecision-making power . . . sought advice from the general\ncounsel . . . on the legal questions raised.” (citations omitted)\n(emphasis added).\n\n    EFF argues that the OLC Opinion constituted the “working\nlaw” of the FBI because it “constituted ‘guidance’ used by [the\nagency] in [its] dealings with the public.” Br. of Appellant at\n29 (quoting Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 869). The Government\ncounters that the FBI’s “[c]onsultation with legal advisers at\nthe Department of Justice constitutes precisely the sort of\n‘give-and-take of the consultative process’ that the deliberative\nprocess privilege was designed to protect.” Br. for Appellee at\n15 (quotations omitted). According to the Government, OLC’s\nOpinion is not the FBI’s “final decision about how, if at all, to\nalter its investigatory techniques,” because “th[is] decision was\nthe FBI’s to make after consulting with OLC and any other\nparts of the government it chose to involve in its policy-making\nprocess.” Id. (quotations omitted).\n\n    Because OLC cannot speak authoritatively on the FBI’s\npolicy, the OLC Opinion differs from memoranda we have\nfound to constitute the “working law” of an agency. In each of\nthese cases, to avoid the development of “secret law,” the\nagency was required to disclose a document that represented a\nconclusive or authoritative statement of its policy, usually a\nhigher authority instructing a subordinate on how the agency’s\ngeneral policy applies to a particular case, or a document that\ndetermined policy or applied established policy. In contrast,\nthe OLC Opinion is more similar to the advice from the Legal\nAdviser to the Secretary of State pertaining to policy in the\nMiddle East in Brinton, or the advice from the Army’s General\nCounsel pertaining to the advisability of a certain contract in\nMurphy. OLC is not authorized to make decisions about the\nFBI’s investigative policy, so the OLC Opinion cannot be an\nauthoritative statement of the agency’s policy. See Colborn\nDecl. at 1-2, reprinted in J.A. 18-19 (“OLC does not purport,\nand in fact lacks authority, to make policy decisions. OLC’s\n\f                                14\n\nlegal advice and analysis may inform the decisionmaking of\nExecutive Branch officials on matters of policy, but OLC’s\nlegal advice is not itself dispositive as to any policy adopted.”).\n\n    EFF argues that the OLC Opinion must be “working law”\nbecause it is controlling (insofar as agencies customarily\nfollow OLC advice that they request), precedential, and can be\nwithdrawn. Br. of Appellant at 22-24, 30-34. That the OLC\nOpinion bears these indicia of a binding legal decision does not\novercome the fact that OLC does not speak with authority on\nthe FBI’s policy; therefore, the OLC Opinion could not be the\n“working law” of the FBI unless the FBI “adopted” what OLC\noffered. In Brinton, we rejected the appellant’s claim that\nmemoranda must be released because they constituted the\n“final opinions” of the Department of State. We explained that\nwhile the privilege does not protect final decisions or\nauthoritative statements on agency policy, the “final opinions”\nof the Department of State’s Legal Adviser, “who has no\nauthority to make final decisions concerning United States\npolicy in the Middle East,” are not final decisions of the\nDepartment of State. 636 F.2d at 605. The same is true of the\nOLC Opinion in this case.\n\n     Even if the OLC Opinion describes the legal parameters of\nwhat the FBI is permitted to do, it does not state or determine\nthe FBI’s policy. The FBI was free to decline to adopt the\ninvestigative tactics deemed legally permissible in the OLC\nOpinion. Indeed, the OIG’s report acknowledged that the FBI\nhad “declined, for the time being, to rely on the authority\ndiscussed in the OLC Opinion.” Br. for Appellee at 15-16\n(citing OIG Report at 265 n.283, reprinted in J.A. 49). The\nOLC Opinion does not provide an authoritative statement of\nthe FBI’s policy. It merely examines policy options available\nto the FBI. Therefore, the OLC Opinion is not the “working\nlaw” of the FBI.\n\n    On this record, we hold that the OLC Opinion reflects\n\f                               15\n\nprecisely the sort of “advisory opinion . . . comprising part of a\nprocess by which governmental decisions and policies are\nformulated” that is covered by the deliberative process\nprivilege.

Dep’t of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415608\"><a href=\"/opinion/415608/nassar-afshar-v-department-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1140 (D.C. Cir. 1983), where the court held that when\n“predecisional recommendations . . . are expressly adopted in\n[a] final, nonexempt memorandum, . . . ‘the reasoning becomes\nthat of the agency and becomes its responsibility to defend.’”\nId. at 1142 (quoting Sears, 421 U.S. at 161) (emphasis in\nSears). In this case, EFF cannot point to any evidence\nsupporting its claim that the FBI expressly adopted the OLC\nOpinion as its reasoning.\n\n    EFF argues that the FBI “adopted” the OLC Opinion by\n“approving[] public references in non-privileged agency\ndocuments (like the OIG report) and reliance in congressional\ntestimony.” Br. of Appellant at 36. EFF relies on two decisions\nin which the Second Circuit held that an agency waived the\nprivilege by referencing an OLC memorandum in its dealings\nwith the public. Id. (citing Brennan Ctr., 697 F.3d at 204; La\nRaza, 411 F.3d at 357). But these cases are inapposite because,\nin each one, the agency itself publicly invoked the reasoning of\nthe OLC memorandum to justify its new position.\n\n    In La Raza, the court found that the “Attorney General and\nhis high-level staff made a practice of using the OLC\nMemorandum to justify and explain the Department [of\nJustice]’s policy and to assure the public and the very state and\nlocal government officials who would be asked to implement\nthe new policy that the policy was legally sound.” 411 F.3d at\n358. In Brennan Center, a U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment guidance document referenced an OLC Opinion\n\f                              17\n\nas a basis for exempting U.S. non-governmental organizations\nfrom a requirement to pledge to oppose sex trafficking in order\nto receive aid. 697 F.3d at 191. And when the agency changed\nthis policy, a director explained during Congressional hearings\nthat OLC had changed its position, and he was “simply\nfollowing . . . the advice” of OLC. Id. at 192 (quotations\nomitted).\n\n    This case differs from the cases cited by EFF because the\npublic references to the OLC Opinion did not come from the\nFBI itself. Rather, the public references originated from the\nOIG and Congress. The OIG mentioned the OLC Opinion in\nits Report and Caproni was asked about it by members of\nCongress. However, the FBI never itself publicly invoked or\nrelied upon the contents of the OLC Opinion. Grumman\nexplained that the adoption exception only applies if “the\nreasoning in the [privileged document] is adopted by the\n[agency] as its reasoning.” 421 U.S. at 184 (emphasis added).\nThe OIG’s references to the OLC Opinion do not establish that\nthe FBI adopted the OLC Opinion as its own reasoning. Nor\ndoes Caproni’s response to inquiries from members of\nCongress establish that the FBI adopted the OLC Opinion’s\nreasoning as its own. Colborn explained that the OLC Opinion\n“has not been made public, and to the extent that it has been\nshared with others in the Government, these individuals would\n. . . only have been persons with an appropriate security\nclearance and a need to know—that is, individuals whose job\nresponsibilities related to national security.” Colborn Decl. at\n6, reprinted in J.A. 23. Colborn made it clear that anyone who\nviewed the OLC Opinion “would have understood the need for\nconfidentiality.” Id.\n\n   When Caproni mentioned the OLC Opinion during\ncongressional hearings, she noted that “[m]any members of\nCongress have asked questions about this OLC opinion.”\nCaproni Testimony at 10, reprinted in J.A. 70. In other words,\nCaproni referenced the OLC Opinion in response to inquiries,\n\f                               18\n\nrather than affirmatively raising it to justify the FBI’s policy.\nCaproni’s testimony thus differs from the communications in\nAfshar, the congressional testimony in Brennan Center, and\nthe statements in La Raza. In Afshar, the court found that the\ndisputed memoranda in that case were predecisional when\nwritten, but the recommendations that they contained were not\nprotected by the deliberative process privilege once they were\n“expressly adopted as the basis for agency action.” 702 F.2d at\n1140. In Brennan Center, a director of the agency explained\nthat he changed positions “following” advice of OLC, and\ndescribed that advice. 697 F.3d at 192. In La Raza, the District\nCourt found that the Department of Justice had, “through the\npublic statements of its representatives, incorporated the OLC\nMemorandum into Department policy.” 411 F.3d at 355. In\ncontrast, Caproni never claimed that the FBI’s investigative\ntactics were justified by the OLC Opinion. To the contrary, she\nactually disavowed reliance on the OLC Opinion, stating that it\n“did not in any way factor into the FBI’s flawed practice of\nusing exigent letters between 2003 and 2006 nor did it affect in\nany way the records-retention decisions made by the FBI as\npart of the reconciliation project.” Caproni Testimony at 10,\nreprinted in J.A. 70. Far from publicly using the OLC Opinion\nto justify the FBI’s position, Caproni’s testimony indicates that\nthe OLC Opinion did not determine the FBI’s actions or\npolicy.\n\nD. Segregability\n\n    It is undisputed that under FOIA non-exempt information\nthat is “reasonably segregable” from exempt information must\nbe disclosed. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). EFF contends that the District\nCourt “erred by failing to determine whether there was\nunclassified, factual information within the OLC Opinion that\nwas ‘reasonably segregable’ from the Opinion’s other\ncontent.” Br. for Appellant at 50. We disagree. In a section\nentitled “Segregability,” the District Court specifically held\nthat “the Department has sufficiently established that no\n\f                               19\n\nportion of the OLC Opinion is reasonably segregable and\nreleasable.” 892 F. Supp. 2d at 104. This holding is supported\nby the record. See Colborn Decl. at 5-7, reprinted in J.A.\n22-24.\n\n    In pressing its claim for segregability, EFF relies on Loving\nv. Dep’t of Defense for the proposition that “the deliberative\nprocess privilege does not protect documents in their entirety;\nif the government can segregate and disclose non-privileged\nfactual information within a document, it must.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187269\"><a href=\"/opinion/187269/loving-v-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n38 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing Army Times Publ’g Co. v. Dep’t of\nAir Force, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611560\"><a href=\"/opinion/611560/the-army-times-publishing-company-v-department-of-the-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). In response,\nthe Government points out that:\n\n    The OLC declarant explained that “[t]hose portions of the\n    Opinion that are marked unclassified reflect other\n    confidential factual as well as confidential legal\n    communications provided by the FBI to OLC for the\n    purpose of obtaining legal advice.” This statement\n    confirms that the entire document reflects the full and\n    frank exchange of ideas between the FBI and OLC, and\n    that revealing portions of the document would reveal the\n    substance of those privileged communications.\n\nBr. for Appellee at 40 (quoting Colborn Decl. at 5-6, reprinted\nin J.A. 22-23 (emphasis added)).\n\n    We agree with the Government that EFF has “ignor[ed] the\ncontext in which factual statements were made [in asserting]\nthat ‘factual material cannot generally be withheld under the\ndeliberative process privilege.’” Id. (quoting Br. for Appellant\nat 51). In other words, because context matters, the proposition\nadvanced by EFF is not inviolate. This point was made clear by\nthe en banc court in Wolfe v. Dep’t of Health and Human Serv.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501788\"><a href=\"/opinion/501788/sidney-m-wolfe-v-department-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1988). In Wolfe, we explained that\n\n    [i]n some circumstances, even material that could be\n\f                              20\n\n    characterized as “factual” would so expose the\n    deliberative process that it must be covered by the\n    privilege. We know of no case in which a court has used\n    the fact/opinion distinction to support disclosure of facts\n    about the inner workings of the deliberative process itself.\n\nId. at 774 (citation omitted); accord In re Sealed Case, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (“The deliberative process\nprivilege does not shield . . . material that is purely factual,\nunless the material is so inextricably intertwined with the\ndeliberative sections of documents that its disclosure would\ninevitably reveal the government's deliberations.”).\n\n    Based on the declarations provided by the Government, the\nDistrict Court correctly concluded that “the unclassified\nportions of the OLC Opinion could not be released without\nharming the deliberative processes of the government by\nchilling the candid and frank communications necessary for\neffective governmental decision-making.” 892 F. Supp. 2d at\n104 (citation, quotations, and alterations omitted). The\nreasoning in Wolfe is thus controlling here.\n\nE. Exemption 1\n\n    Because we find that the entire OLC Opinion is exempt\nfrom disclosure under the deliberative process privilege, there\nis no need for this court to determine whether certain portions\nof the OLC Opinion were properly withheld as classified under\nExemption 1.\n\n                     III.   CONCLUSION\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.\n\f</pre>",
