GARZA and PARKER,\nCircuit Judges.\n\nKING, Chief Judge:\n\n     Defendant-Appellant Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana\n\n(“Parish”) appeals the district court’s grant of a permanent\n\ninjunction in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Groome Resources Ltd.,\n\nL.L.C. (“Groome Resources”).   The permanent injunction enjoined\n\nthe Parish from interfering with or withholding approval of\n\fGroome Resources’ application for “reasonable accommodations”\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B) to operate a for-profit group\n\nhome for five individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nSpecifically, the Parish raises a constitutional challenge to the\n\nstatutory basis of the district court’s injunction.   The Parish\n\nargues that Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in\n\npassing § 3604(f)(3)(B) of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of\n\n1988 (FHAA),1 which defines housing discrimination to include a\n\nrefusal to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped\n\nindividuals.   We join three circuits in concluding that Congress\n\nacted under its Commerce Clause power in enacting the FHAA, and\n\nbecause, under the facts presented, Groome Resources is a for-\n\nprofit company engaged in and substantially affecting interstate\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Section 3604 reads in relevant part:\n\n           It shall be unlawful—\n         . . .\n           (f) To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to\n           otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\n           buyer or renter because of a handicap-\n         . . .\n           (3) For purposes of this subsection, discrimination\n           includes–\n         . . .\n           (B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in\n                rules, policies, practices, or services, when such\n                accommodations may be necessary to afford such\n                person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a\n                dwelling . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\n\n                                 2\n\fcommerce, we AFFIRM the district court.   See U.S. CONST. art. I,\n\n§ 8, cl. 3.\n\n\n\n\n               I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Groome Resources is a for-profit limited liability\n\npartnership that operates group homes for individuals afflicted\n\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.   These homes provide full-time\n\nsupervision, food, shelter, and supportive services for elderly\n\npatients who are unable to live independently due to their\n\nillness.   Each home cares for five Alzheimer’s patients and is\n\nstaffed by a full-time, rotating caretaker.   Each patient pays\n\n$3,400 per month for his or her accommodations and care.    Groome\n\nResources currently operates four group homes in the Greater New\n\nOrleans area and seeks to open a fifth in a residential district\n\nof the Parish of Jefferson.\n\n     To facilitate this expansion, on February 8, 1999, Groome\n\nResources signed a contract to purchase a home at 5109 Elmwood\n\nParkway located in the Parish.   The contract was between Groome\n\nResources and the seller, Cendant Mobility Services Corporation,\n\na national relocation assistance organization.   The agreement to\n\npurchase was contingent on Groome Resources obtaining a variance\n\nto the local zoning laws, which would permit the operation of a\n\ngroup home for five unrelated individuals operated for profit.\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fGroome Resources had scheduled a closing date for the home for\n\none month from the signing.\n\n     The Parish zoning ordinance at issue regulates property use\n\nin single-family residential districts.       The zoning ordinance\n\nprovides,\n\n     This district is composed of certain lands and structures\n     having a low density, single family residential character\n     and additional open area where it is desirable and likely\n     that such similar development will occur. Uses are limited\n     to single family residences and such non-residential uses as\n     are intended primarily to provide service to the adjacent\n     neighborhood.\n\nJEFFERSON PARISH, LA., COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE, § VII-A, at 7A-1,\n\nno. 1 (1998).    The zoning ordinance defines “family” as,\n\n     one or more persons related by blood or marriage living\n     together and occupying a single housekeeping unit with\n     single culinary facilities or a group of not more than four\n     persons living together by mutual agreement and occupying a\n     single housekeeping unit with single culinary facilities on\n     a non-profit cost-sharing basis.\n\nId. § III, at 3-6, no. 25.\n\n     The Parish zoning ordinance also provides a process by which\n\nreasonable accommodations can be made for handicapped residents\n\nunder the Fair Housing Amendments Act:\n\n     Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent a\n     reasonable accommodation for handicapped persons as defined\n     by the Federal Fair Housing Act in accordance with Federal,\n     State and Parish procedures. Application for reasonable\n     accommodation shall be submitted to the Department of\n     Inspection and Code Enforcement for review and approval.\n\nId. § XX, at 20-25, no. 14.      On February 11, 1999, Groome\n\nResources applied for a “reasonable accommodation” to allow the\n\nproposed group home for five non-related individuals to operate\n\n                                    4\n\fin a single-family dwelling on a for-profit basis.   Groome\n\nResources had successfully applied for a similar group home in\n\nanother residential district in the Parish, a request that had\n\nbeen granted within forty-five days.\n\n     Under the procedures set up by the Parish, an application\n\nfor reasonable accommodations must be reviewed by the Department\n\nof Inspection and Code Enforcement and the Parish Attorney’s\n\nOffice. There is no formalized procedure or timetable for an\n\napplication, although the target timetable is forty-five days.\n\nIn addition, the councilman in whose district the property sits\n\nand the residents of the district are notified about the\n\napplication.\n\n     On March 15, 1999, the Parish Attorney’s Office recommended\n\napproval of Groome Resources’ application for reasonable\n\naccommodations for the Elmwood Parkway group home.   On March 16,\n\n1999, the director of the Department of Inspection and Code\n\nEnforcement also recommended approval of the application.\n\nSeveral days later, however, members of the Elmwood Park Civic\n\nAssociation, through their councilman, voiced opposition to the\n\napplication.   On March 19, 1999, residents of the neighborhood,\n\nthe councilman and the Parish Attorney met to discuss the planned\n\ngroup home.2   Due to the opposition of the residents, no official\n\n     2\n        A March 20, 1999 letter from Libby Olivier Tittle, 1st\nVice President of the Elmwood Park Civic Association, to\nCouncilman Edmond J. Muniz, included in the record, evidences the\ncommunity sentiment toward the group home. Entitled “Elmwood\n\n                                 5\n\fdecision was made regarding the Groome Resources reasonable\n\naccommodations application.\n\n     On April 28, 1999, Groome Resources wrote to the Parish to\n\ninquire about its pending application.3   The letter threatened\n\nlegal action pursuant to the FHAA if the reasonable\n\naccommodations request was not decided upon.   Groome Resources\n\nexplained that, due to the delay, it had accrued monetary damages\n\nrelated to the rescheduling of the closing date on the property.\n\nThe Parish responded by letter on April 30, 1999, stating that\n\nthe application remained under review and further information\n\nmight be requested.   On May 4, 1999, the Parish requested\n\nadditional information on the Groome Resources company and the\n\n\nPark Civic Association’s Opposition to Group Home at 5109 Elmwood\nParkway,” the letter summarizes the meeting between the neighbors\nand the councilman. In relevant part it states:\n\n     The permit has not yet been granted and will be delayed to\n     allow both Tom Wilkinson, Parish Attorney, and our Civic\n     Association to prepare to challenge the opening and\n     operating of this group home.\n     . . .\n     (2) You [Councilman Muniz] oppose the granting of the\n     permit. Tom Wilkinson will recommend that the Parish\n     Council not approve the permit because it could be a good\n     test case to challenge these group homes in R-1 classified\n     zones.\n\nLetter from Libby Olivier Tittle, 1st Vice President of the\nElmwood Park Civic Association to Councilman Edmond J. Muniz\n(March 20, 1999).\n     3\n        The United States Justice Department, Civil Rights\nDivision also wrote to the Parish on May 6, 1999, inquiring about\nthe status of Groome Resources’ application. The Parish\nAttorney, Thomas Wilkinson, informed the Justice Department that\nthe application was under review.\n\n                                 6\n\fproposal for the Elmwood Parkway group home.    On May 12, 1999,\n\nGroome Resources submitted the requested information to the\n\nParish.    On May 14, 1999, Groome Resources filed suit in federal\n\ndistrict court seeking injunctive relief “enjoining and\n\nrestraining the [Parish] from withholding approval of [the]\n\nApplication for Reasonable Accommodation.”\n\n     Groome Resources argued that the Parish’s continued delay\n\nfrustrated the purpose of the FHAA and was tantamount to a denial\n\nof its reasonable accommodations application.    As such, Groome\n\nResources argued it was discriminated against under the FHAA and\n\nsought an injunction to remedy that discrimination.    In response,\n\nthe Parish argued that the suit was premature as no final\n\ndecision had been made on the application, that Groome Resources\n\ncould not meet the procedural or substantive requirements for an\n\ninjunction, and that the enactment of the reasonable\n\naccommodations provision exceeded the constitutional authority of\n\nCongress.\n\n     The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Groome\n\nResources’ motion for a preliminary injunction and consolidated\n\nit with a trial on the merits.   The district court held that the\n\nFHAA was “a valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Commerce\n\nClause.”    Further, it found that despite the fact that the Parish\n\nhad never formally denied Groome Resources’ application, the case\n\nwas ripe for decision.   Deposition testimony revealed that there\n\nwas no planned action on the application, and the district court\n\n                                  7\n\ffound that the attorney in charge of the review process “could\n\nnot say what the current status of the application was, what if\n\nanything remained to be done to complete the process or when it\n\nmight be done, and could not say who the ultimate decision maker\n\nwould be.”   The district court concluded that “the Parish delayed\n\nacting on the application in the hope that the matter will become\n\nmoot if the proposed purchase falls through.”   Therefore, “to\n\ndeny plaintiff’s claim as premature would effectively frustrate\n\nthe clear mandates of the Fair Housing Act.”\n\n     In determining the merits of the reasonable accommodations\n\napplication, the district court found that the addition of one\n\nperson to the four person limit was reasonable and necessary to\n\nallow individuals with Alzheimer’s disease an equal opportunity\n\nto live in a residential setting, and that “[t]he trial evidence\n\nconvinces the Court that the artificial limit of four unrelated\n\npersons living in a single group home will make it economically\n\nunfeasible for [Groome Resources] to operate the proposed home.”\n\nThe district court concluded,\n\n     The other homes operated by Groome have been well received\n     by their residential neighbors. Since none of the residents\n     drive, there are few if any automobiles at the homes. There\n     is absolutely no evidence that this proposed group home with\n     five Alzheimer’s patients would cause any problems or in any\n     way impact the health, safety, welfare or character of the\n     neighborhood. If the home was occupied by a family, there\n     would be no limit on the number of persons who reside there,\n     or the number of automobiles or visitors at the home. In\n     fact, the same residential zoning permits small home\n     businesses, schools, and day care centers, all of which\n     cause more congestion and traffic problems than is expected\n     from the group home. The requested accommodation is clearly\n\n                                 8\n\f     reasonable and necessary to allow the handicapped to have\n     equal opportunity to live in residential settings of their\n     choice, as mandated by the Fair Housing Act Amendments of\n     1988.\n\nAccordingly, the district court permanently enjoined the Parish\n\nfrom interfering with or withholding approval of a reasonable\n\naccommodations application for Groome Resources.\n\n     On appeal, the Parish challenges the constitutional basis of\n\nthe district court’s holding — namely the constitutional\n\nauthority of Congress to pass 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B).   First,\n\nthe Parish argues that Congress exceeded its authority under the\n\nCommerce Clause in enacting the “reasonable accommodations”\n\nclause.   Second, the Parish argues in the alternative that\n\n§ 3604(f)(3)(B)’s reasonable accommodations standard, as applied\n\nto facially neutral zoning ordinances, is void for vagueness.4\n\nAfter careful interpretation of the legislative history of the\n\n\n\n     4\n        We accept that the Parish has properly appealed the\nconstitutionality of § 3604(f)(3)(B) and dismiss Groome\nResources’ procedural challenges to this appeal. First, we\ndisagree with Groome Resources’ contention that the district\ncourt’s injunction rested on a finding of disparate impact and,\nthus, remains in effect regardless of our decision on the\nconstitutionality of the reasonable accommodations provision of\nthe FHAA. The focus of the injunction was clearly the failure of\nthe Parish to provide reasonable accommodations for the proposed\ngroup home and not a finding that there was a discriminatory\nintent or effect on handicapped individuals in the Parish.\nSecond, we disagree with Groome Resources’ argument that the\nParish’s failure to brief in detail a Fourteenth Amendment\nchallenge to the FHAA is fatal to its overarching constitutional\nchallenge. The district court expressly held that the FHAA “was\na valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.”\nIt is from that finding that the Parish based its appeal.\n\n                                 9\n\fFHAA, and an analysis of the Supreme Court’s recent Commerce\n\nClause cases, we affirm the holding of the district court.5\n\n\n\n                       II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     We review the constitutionality of a federal statute de\n\nnovo.    See United States v. Luna, 165 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Bailey, 115 F.3d 1222, 1225 (5th Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n\n\n                             III.   RIPENESS\n\n     As an initial matter, we affirm the district court’s holding\n\nthat the issue before this court is ripe for review.\n\nJurisdiction is a question of law which we review de novo.     See\n\nUnited States v. Jimenez-Martinez, 179 F.3d 980, 981 (5th Cir.\n\n1999); see also Powder River Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt,\n\n54 F.3d 1477, 1483 (10th Cir. 1995) (“Because ripeness is a\n\njurisdictional issue, our standard of review is de novo.”).\n\n     While not briefed or argued by the Parish, federal courts\n\nhave a duty to consider objections to our jurisdiction sua\n\nsponte.    See United Transp. Union v. Foster, 205 F.3d 851, 857\n\n(5th Cir. 2000) (“[E]very federal appellate court has a special\n\n\n     5\n        Because we conclude that Congress possesses the\nauthority to enact the FHAA as an activity substantially\naffecting interstate commerce, we need not reach the alternative\nargument that Congress possessed authority to enact the Act under\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                    10\n\fobligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,\n\nbut also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even\n\nthough the parties are prepared to concede it.” (quoting Steel\n\nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998)).\n\n     “A court should dismiss a case for lack of ‘ripeness’ when\n\nthe case is abstract or hypothetical.   The key considerations are\n\n‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship\n\nto the parties of withholding court consideration.’. . .    A case\n\nis generally ripe if any remaining questions are purely legal\n\nones; conversely, a case is not ripe if further factual\n\ndevelopment is required.”   New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v.\n\nCouncil of New Orleans, 833 F.2d 583, 586-87 (5th Cir. 1987)\n\n(citations omitted) (quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S.\n\n136, 149 (1967), modified on other grounds by Califano v.\n\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977)).   We find that the district court\n\nwas correct in resolving the legal question of whether the Parish\n\nhad failed to approve Groome Resources’ reasonable accommodations\n\napplication for its group home, and that the hardship to Groome\n\nResources constituted an immediate injury requiring judicial\n\nrelief.\n\n     First, as to the “fitness of the issues for judicial\n\ndecision,” we agree with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\n\nCircuit that “[u]nder the Fair Housing Act . . . a violation\n\noccurs when the disabled resident is first denied a reasonable\n\naccommodation, irrespective of the remedies granted in subsequent\n\n                                11\n\fproceedings.”   Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, Md. 124\n\nF.3d 597, 602 (4th Cir. 1997).6    This denial can be both actual\n\nor constructive, as an indeterminate delay has the same effect as\n\nan outright denial.   In the instant case, the district court was\n\nwell within its discretion to decide that a reasonable\n\naccommodation was denied by the unjustified delay of the Parish\n\nofficials.\n\n     From the facts at trial, a full and complete application had\n\nbeen submitted and been reviewed.7     The district court recognized\n\nthat ninety-five days had elapsed between the time the\n\napplication was submitted and the filing of the lawsuit, and\n\ndespite the target date of forty-five days, the application had\n\nbeen pending for 127 days without action at the time of the\n\ncourt’s decision.   During this time, Groome Resources was\n\n\n\n\n     6\n        As such, ripeness in the Fair Housing Act context must\nbe distinguished from ripeness cases involving unconstitutional\ntakings or other zoning issues. See Bryant, 124 F.3d at 602\n(“Fair Housing Act claims are thus unlike takings claims, which\ndo not ripen until post-decisional procedures are invoked without\nachieving a just compensation.”).\n     7\n        Persuasive to the district court was the fact that the\nonly two governmental departments that needed to approve the\nreasonable accommodations application had unofficially approved\nthe application in March. The effect of the intervention of the\ndistrict councilman and the Parish residents was evident as\napproval by the councilman or the residents was not required in\nthe process. The continued delay based on neighborhood\nopposition, see Letter of Libby Olivier Tittle, supra note 2,\ntherefore, demonstrated an attempt to frustrate Groome Resources’\npurchase and operation of a group home.\n\n                                  12\n\frequired to postpone its closing date several times.8    Further,\n\nthe court found that four months after the filing of the lawsuit,\n\nthe Parish officials in charge of the application could not\n\nprovide any timetable or plan for acting on the application.\n\nWhile never formally denying the request, the Parish’s\n\nunjustified and indeterminate delay had the same effect of\n\nundermining the anti-discriminatory purpose of the FHAA.    As no\n\nfurther factual development was required, the district court\n\nexercised its discretion to resolve the legal issue presented.\n\n     Regarding the second factor of the ripeness inquiry,\n\n“[n]umerous courts have stressed that housing discrimination\n\ncauses a uniquely immediate injury.   Such discrimination, which\n\nunder the FHA includes a refusal to make reasonable\n\naccommodations, makes these controversies ripe.”   Assisted Living\n\nAssocs. v. Moorestown Township, 996 F. Supp. 409, 427 (D.N.J.\n\n1998) (listing cases).   In addition to the discriminatory injury\n\nnecessitating judicial relief, Groome Resources faces concrete\n\neconomic hardship from the continued delay.   The district court\n\nfound that Groome Resources would be liable for a $2000 penalty\n\nfor the delay in closing, not to mention the economic loss of\n\nbeing unable to operate the facility.   Further delay in obtaining\n\njudicial resolution of this issue will likely cause additional\n\n     8\n        The district court was even forced to intervene on\nbehalf of Groome Resources to secure one of the postponements in\nthe closing date and found in its opinion that “[the closing]\nlikely will not be extended further.”\n\n                                13\n\fharm to Groome Resources.   Because the financial penalties\n\nresulting from the delay in closing and in commencing operations,\n\npresent concrete hardships for the plaintiffs that frustrate the\n\npurpose of the FHAA, we agree with the district court that the\n\nissue is ripe for review.\n\n\n\n    IV.   CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n     We today join three other circuits that have upheld the\n\nconstitutionality of the Fair Housing Amendments Act.   See Oxford\n\nHouse-C v.

Purpose of the Fair Housing Amendments Act\n\n     In response to a history of national discrimination against\n\nindividuals with disabilities, Congress enacted the FHAA in\n\n1988.9   The purpose of the Act was to prohibit discrimination in\n\n     9\n         Section 3604 provides in pertinent part:\n\n     [I]t shall be unlawful–\n        . . . .\n     (f) (1) To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to\n               otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to\n               any buyer or renter because of a handicap of–\n\n                (A) that buyer or renter,\n                (B) a person residing in or intending to reside in\n                that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made\n                available; or\n                (C) any person associated with that buyer or\n                renter.\n\n           (2) To discriminate against any person in the terms,\n              conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a\n              dwelling, or in the provision of services or\n              facilities in connection with such dwelling,\n              because of a handicap of—\n\n                                15\n\fthe national housing market for handicapped10 individuals.    As\n\nthe House Report stated,\n\n     The Fair Housing Amendments Act . . . is a clear\n     pronouncement of a national commitment to end the\n     unnecessary exclusion of persons with handicaps from the\n     American mainstream. It repudiates the use of stereotypes\n     and ignorance, and mandates that persons with handicaps be\n     considered as individuals. Generalized perceptions about\n     disabilities and unfounded speculations about threats to\n     safety are specifically rejected as grounds to justify\n     exclusion.\n\nH.R. REP.

Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432,\n\n435 (1985) (which held that there was no rational basis for a\n\nzoning ordinance that had the effect of excluding citizens with\n\nmental retardation from living in the community)).   As in\n\nCleburne, Congress took particular note of how local zoning laws\n\nhad been used to discriminate and thus affect housing\n\nopportunities for the disabled:\n\n     These new subsections would also apply to state or local\n     land use and health and safety laws, regulations, practices\n     or decisions which discriminate against individuals with\n     handicaps. While state and local governments have authority\n     to protect safety and health, and to regulate use of land,\n     that authority has sometimes been used to restrict the\n     ability of individuals with handicaps to live in\n     communities. This has been accomplished by such means as\n     the enactment or imposition of health, safety or land-use\n     requirements on congregate living arrangements among non-\n     related persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n        See Fair Housing Act of 1968, Pub.

See Pub. L. No. 93-\n383, 88 Stat. 83 (1974).\n\n                                  17\n\fH.R. REP. NO. 100-711, at 24, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2173,\n\n2185 (emphasis added).13\n\n     The “reasonable accommodations” language, now codified in 42\n\nU.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B), specifically targeted the type of zoning\n\nregulations at issue here.   Congress found that these seemingly\n\n“neutral rules and regulations,” even those involving commercial/\n\nnoncommercial zoning distinctions, nonetheless had a\n\ndiscriminatory effect on the housing choices available for the\n\ndisabled.   See id. (“The Committee intends that the prohibition\n\nagainst discrimination against those with handicaps apply to\n\nzoning decisions and practices.”).   Primarily, the discriminatory\n\neffect recognized by Congress resulted from the fact that the\n\ndisabled were not able to live safely and independently without\n\norganized, and sometimes commercial, group homes like the one at\n\nissue.14\n\n     13\n        Section 3604 also governs organizations like Groome\nResources that provide services to the disabled. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(a)-(f).\n     14\n        In Cleburne, which informed the passage of the FHAA, the\nSupreme Court adopted this circuit’s findings that “without group\nhomes . . . the retarded could never hope to integrate themselves\ninto the community.” 473 U.S. at 438 (citing Cleburne Living\nCtr., Inc., v. City of Cleburne, 726 F.2d 191, 193 (5th Cir.\n1984)). The Fifth Circuit’s findings, in turn, were informed by\nthe district court’s findings, which go directly to the issue\nhere regarding the importance of commercially run homes for\nhandicapped individuals,\n\n     “Group homes currently are the principal community living\n     alternatives for persons who are mentally retarded. The\n     availability of such a home in communities is an essential\n     ingredient of normal living patterns for persons who are\n\n                                18\n\f     In the scheme of the FHAA, the reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision exists as a prohibition on discrimination against the\n\ndisabled in the purchase, sale, or rental of housing.   As set out\n\nin § 3604(f)(3)(B), the failure to reasonably accommodate the\n\ndisabled in the context of housing is, itself, a defined act of\n\ndiscrimination.   The question before this court is whether the\n\nactivity of regulating discrimination against the disabled in the\n\npurchase, sale, or rental of housing can be shown to\n\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce, and therefore be upheld\n\nas a legitimate exercise of congressional authority.\n\n\n\n      B. Congressional Authority Under the Commerce Clause\n\n     The Commerce Clause grants Congress the constitutional\n\nauthority “‘to regulate Commerce . . . among the several states,’\n\nand [] concomitant power to protect the nation’s commerce by\n\nenacting such laws as it deems ‘necessary and proper.’”   United\n\n\n\n\n     mentally retarded, and each factor that makes such group\n     homes harder to establish operates to exclude persons who\n     are mentally retarded from the community.”\n\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 439 n. 6 (quoting Cleburne, 726 F.2d at\n193). Other circuits have recognized that commercial group homes\nmay be the only way for disabled individuals to live in a\nresidential community: “As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit has observed, ‘the handicapped may have little choice but\nto live in a commercial home if they desire to live in a\nresidential neighborhood.” Hovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89\nF.3d 1096, 1105 (3d Cir. 1996) (quoting Smith & Lee Assocs.,\nInc. v. City of Taylor, Mich., 13 F.3d 920, 931 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\n\n                                19\n\fStates v. Robinson, 119 F.3d 1205, 1209 (5th Cir. 1997) (quoting\n\nU.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, 18).\n\n     In interpreting the commerce power, courts are bound both by\n\nthe “first principles” of a Constitution that establishes a\n\nfederal government with “enumerated powers,” and our judicial\n\nrole, which requires deference to properly enacted congressional\n\nregulations.   See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 552, 556.   As Judge\n\nHigginbotham recognized in United States v. Kirk,\n\n     On the one hand, courts have a constitutional duty to\n     scrutinize congressional actions to ensure that Congress\n     stays within its constitutionally enumerated powers; if\n     Lopez means anything, it is that Congress’s power under the\n     Commerce Clause must have some limits. On the other hand,\n     we must discipline our scrutiny to ensure that we are about\n     the business of judicial review and not the business of\n     social policy. Stated another way, respecting the policy-\n     making role of majoritarian legislative bodies is not an\n     empty recitation.\n\n105 F.3d 997, 999 (5th Cir. 1997) (equally divided en banc court)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   Thus, while\n\nrecognized as “one of the most prolific sources of national\n\npower,” H.P. Hood & Sons v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 534 (1949),\n\nthe commerce power is cabined within constitutionally determined\n\n“outer limits.”   See United States v. Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1740,\n\n1748-49 (2000) (citing United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 556\n\n(1995)) (“Lopez emphasized . . . that even under our modern,\n\nexpansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress’\n\nregulatory authority is not without effective bounds.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                20\n\f     We turn first to the framework establishing those outer\n\nlimits.   In reviewing an act of Congress passed under its\n\nCommerce Clause authority, we apply the rational basis test as\n\ninterpreted by the Lopez court.    See, e.g., Robinson, 119 F.3d at\n\n1210; United States v. Bailey, 115 F.3d 1222, 1225 (5th Cir.\n\n1997); United States v. Knutson, 113 F.3d 27, 29 (5th Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Bird, 124 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir. 1997); United\n\nStates v. Coleman, 78 F.3d 154, 159 (5th Cir. 1996).   Our\n\nanalysis is, therefore, guided by this precedent and the\n\nconstitutional principles set forth in Lopez15 and elucidated in\n\nthe Supreme Court’s recent discussion in Morrison.16\n\n\n\n 1. Commerce Clause After Lopez: Three Categories of Interstate\n\n                             Activity\n\n     The Lopez Court described “three broad categories of\n\nactivity” that Congress may regulate pursuant to its Commerce\n\nClause power.   See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558.   “First, Congress may\n\nregulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.”    Id.\n\n\n     15\n        Lopez invalidated the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990,\n18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(1)(A), which made it a federal crime to\nknowingly possess a firearm in a school zone. See 514 U.S. at\n552.\n     16\n        Morrison invalidated the federal civil remedy provision\nof the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 13981(b).\nThe Supreme Court found that Congress lacked the constitutional\nauthority to enact the section’s civil remedy, finding neither\nCommerce Clause authority nor authority under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. See 120 S. Ct. at 1754.\n\n                                  21\n\f(citing United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 114-15 (1941) and\n\nHeart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 256\n\n(1964)).    “This category extends beyond the regulation of\n\nhighways, railroads, air routes, navigable rivers, fiber-optic\n\ncables and the like.”     Robinson, 119 F.3d at 1210.   This category\n\nwas one of the categories used to prohibit racial discrimination\n\nin public accommodations and has been used to prevent illicit\n\ngoods from traveling through the channels of commerce.       See id.\n\n(citing Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 256).\n\n       “Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the\n\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in\n\ninterstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from\n\nintrastate activities.”     Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558 (citing\n\nShreveport Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 342 (1914), S. Ry. Co. v. United\n\nStates, 222 U.S. 20 (1911), and Perez v. United States, 402 U.S.\n\n146 (1971)).    “Congressional regulation or protection of persons\n\nor things that move in interstate commerce must ensure that, in\n\nfact, a particular threat — whether posed by an interstate or\n\nintrastate activity — actually threatens persons or things with a\n\nplain and clear nexus to interstate commerce.”     Bird, 124 F.3d at\n\n674.\n\n       “Finally, Congress’ commerce authority includes the power to\n\nregulate those activities having a substantial relation to\n\ninterstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially\n\naffect interstate commerce.”     Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558-59 (citing\n\n                                  22\n\fNLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937), and\n\nMaryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183 (1968)).    This category includes\n\ntwo separate analytical components: first, whether the regulated\n\nactivity involves “commerce” or “economic” activity and, second,\n\nwhether the regulation is “an essential part of a larger\n\nregulation of economic activity.”     Id. at 561.   As will be\n\ndiscussed in more detail below, Morrison further refined this\n\nthird category of interstate activity.\n\n     In delineating these categories, the Lopez Court also\n\nreaffirmed traditional principles of Commerce Clause\n\njurisprudence.   See United States v. Knutson, 113 F.3d 27, 29\n\n(5th Cir. 1997) (“In [Lopez] the Court identified an outer limit\n\nto congressional authority under the Commerce Clause; . . . the\n\nCourt did not purport to eliminate or erode well-established\n\nCommerce Clause precedents.”).   More specifically, the Lopez\n\nCourt reaffirmed the rational basis test by which we are bound to\n\nevaluate the constitutionality of congressional actions.         See\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 557 (recognizing the duty of courts to\n\nevaluate whether “a rational basis exist[s] for concluding that a\n\nregulated activity sufficiently affect[s] interstate commerce”).\n\nFurther, this circuit has interpreted Lopez as reaffirming “the\n\nproposition set forth in Wickard v. Filburn17 concerning\n\n     17\n        317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942) (“[E]ven if appellee’s activity\nbe local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may\nstill, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a\nsubstantial economic effect on interstate commerce.”).\n\n                                 23\n\fcongressional regulation of intrastate, noncommercial activity.”\n\nUnited States v. Bird, 124 F.3d 667, 676 (5th Cir. 1997) (“After\n\nWickard — and its reaffirmance in Lopez — there can be no\n\nquestion that Congress is able to regulate noncommercial,\n\nintrastate activity that substantially affects interstate\n\ncommerce.”).\n\n\n\n 2. Commerce Clause After Morrison: Refinement of Lopez’s Third\n\n         Category of Permissible Congressional Regulation\n\n     In Morrison, the Supreme Court clarified this circuit’s\n\ninterpretation of Lopez and provided further analytical guidance\n\nas to the third category of activity — “substantially affecting\n\ninterstate commerce.”   The Morrison Court looked to four\n\nadditional factors to determine whether the congressional act at\n\nissue exceeded the scope of its constitutional authority.\n\n     First, the Court considered the “economic nature of the\n\nregulated activity.”    See Morrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750 (“‘Where\n\neconomic activity substantially affects interstate commerce,\n\nlegislation regulating that activity will be sustained.’”)\n\n(quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 560).     The Court emphasized the\n\neconomic or commercial character of previous Commerce Clause\n\ncases.   See id. (collecting cases).    The Court found that in both\n\nLopez and Morrison, neither the “actors” nor the “conduct” of the\n\nregulation had a commercial character, and neither the “purpose”\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\fnor the “design” of the statute had an evident commercial nexus.\n\nSee id.\n\n     Second, the Morrison court determined that the lack of an\n\nexpress jurisdictional element in the Lopez statute weakened the\n\nclaim that Congress was acting within its Commerce Clause powers.\n\nSee id. at 1750-51 (“Such a jurisdictional element may establish\n\nthat the enactment is in pursuance of Congress’ regulation of\n\ninterstate commerce.”).\n\n     Third, the Court found that while Congress was not required\n\nto make formal findings, “the existence of such findings may\n\n‘enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity\n\nin question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even\n\nthough no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked\n\neye.’”    Id. at 1751 (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 553).\n\n     Finally, the Court cautioned against accepting an\n\n“attenuated” connection between the regulation and the interstate\n\nactivity.    See id.   Concerned that causal, “but-for” arguments\n\ncould lead to an evisceration of any limitations on federal\n\npower, the Court held Congress to a more direct link.\n\n     With these interpretive principles in mind, we now turn to\n\nanalyze the Parish’s challenge to the reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision of the FHAA.    Our task is to determine whether Congress\n\nhad a rational basis, as defined by Lopez-Morrison, to enact\n\n§ 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\f  C. The FHAA Substantially Affects Interstate Commerce and Is\n\n         Constitutional Under a Lopez-Morrison Analysis\n\n     The Parish argues that none of the Lopez categories would\n\nprovide Congress the authority to enact the FHAA.   We agree that\n\nthe first and second Lopez categories, involving the use of the\n\nchannels of interstate commerce, and instrumentalities of\n\ninterstate commerce are inapplicable here.   It is the third Lopez\n\ncategory, involving activities that substantially affect\n\ninterstate commerce, on which we base our rejection of the\n\nParish’s Commerce Clause argument.   To reach our conclusion, we\n\nanalyze each of the four additional Morrison factors in turn.\n\n\n\n  1. The Reasonable Accommodations Provision Regulates Economic\n\n   Activity Involving the Purchase, Sale, or Rental of Housing\n\n      Under Lopez-Morrison, to figure out whether an activity\n\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce, the first question we\n\nmust ask is whether the regulated activity is an activity\n\neconomic in nature.   See 120 S. Ct. at 1750 (“[The Court’s]\n\nreview of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those\n\ncases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate\n\nactivity based upon the activity’s substantial effects on\n\ninterstate commerce, the activity in question has been some sort\n\nof economic endeavor.”).   This query derives from the general\n\nLopez requirement that the regulated intrastate activities,\n\n“arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,\n\n                                26\n\fwhich viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate\n\ncommerce.”   Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561.\n\n     More specifically, the first Morrison question regarding\n\n“economic” activity, is answered by a close reading of Lopez,\n\nwhich provides two recognized and historically rooted means of\n\ncongressional regulation under the commerce power: (1) whether\n\nthe activity is “any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly\n\none might define those terms”; or (2) whether the activity exists\n\nas “an essential part of a larger regulation of economic\n\nactivity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless\n\nthe intrastate activity were regulated.”   Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561.\n\nUsing these two questions as our analytical framework, we\n\ndetermine under Lopez-Morrison, that Congress acted within its\n\nconstitutional power to enact the FHAA reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision.\n\n\n\n  a. The Purchase, Sale, or Rental of Residential Housing Is an\n\n                   Economic/Commercial Activity\n\n     The Parish argues that the activity being regulated is\n\n“wholly non-economic” and presumably non-commercial.   We disagree\n\nfinding that § 3604(f)(3)(B) affected the commercial transaction\n\nof purchasing a home and the commercial rental of housing, and,\n\ntherefore, fits well within the broad definition of economic\n\nactivity established by the Supreme Court and other circuits.\n\n\n\n                                27\n\f     The activity being regulated is one that directly affects\n\nthe commercial residential and rental housing market.         “In every\n\ncase where we have sustained federal regulation under Wickard’s\n\naggregation principle, the regulated activity was of an apparent\n\ncommercial character.”     Morrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750 n.4.       A\n\ndenial of reasonable accommodations affects a disabled\n\nindividual’s ability to buy, sell, or rent housing.         It is an act\n\nof discrimination that directly interferes with a commercial\n\ntransaction, and is an act that can be regulated to facilitate\n\neconomic activity.    The Parish’s decision to deny Groome\n\nResources a reasonable accommodation, therefore, is directly tied\n\nto the economic activity of buying a home, and the commercial\n\nactivity of operating an Alzheimer’s care facility.\n\n     As all American homeowners can attest, it is a transparently\n\ncommercial action to buy, sell, or rent a house.        Not only is it\n\nquite literally a “commercial transaction,” but viewed in the\n\naggregate, it implicates an entire commercial industry.18         A\n\npurchase of a house is “commercial intercourse,” Gibbons v.\n\n     18\n          The residential housing market in the United States is\nof tremendous economic significance to the national economy. In\n1997, the United States Census reported that the single-family\nhousing construction industry was valued at over $146 billion and\nemployed over 570,000 people. See U.S. DEP’T OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF\nTHE CENSUS: 1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS, CONSTRUCTION, tbl. 3, at 9, tbl. 2, at\n8; see also United States v. Patterson, 792 F.2d 531, 534 (5th\nCir. 1986) (“Housing construction is certainly a commercial\nactivity.”). Further, residential real estate lessors, agents,\nbrokers, and managers had revenues of over $91 billion. See U.S.\nDEP’T OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS: 1997 ECONOMIC CENSUS, REAL ESTATE\nAND RENTAL AND LEASING, tbl. 1, at 7.\n\n                                   28\n\fOgden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 193 (1824), at its purest form,\n\ninvolving capital outlay, financing and mortgage arrangements,\n\nprofit, debt and investment considerations, and thus speaks to\n\nboth the “commercial character” and economic nature of the\n\ntransaction.19\n\n     In the instant case, not only are we faced with a commercial\n\ntransaction, but an interstate commercial transaction.      Groome\n\nResources, a New Orleans-based limited liability partnership,\n\ncontracted to purchase a house from Cendant Mobility Services\n\nCorporation, a national relocating company.      This interstate\n\npurchase was financed by an interstate lender, Whitney National\n\nBank.     Most importantly, this interstate commercial transaction\n\nwas impeded by an act of housing discrimination — namely the\n\nParish’s failure to reasonably accommodate disabled individuals\n\nwishing to live in a group home.       Therefore, as a factual matter,\n\nGroome Resources’ proposed purchase of rental property to be used\n\nas a group home satisfies the requirement that we are confronting\n\na commercial and economic activity.\n\n     The commercial nature of this activity is further\n\nstrengthened by the fact that Groome Resources exists as a for-\n\n     19\n        Moreover, most housing purchases involve realtors,\nbrokers, title insurance, title registration and legal fees, and\nmay involve federally backed mortgages and the secondary mortgage\nmarket. In addition to supporting the commercial nature of a\nhousing purchase, many of the above factors also involve actors\nwith interstate ties. See McLain v. Real Estate Bd. Inc., 444\nU.S. 232, 245 (1980); Goldfarb v. Va. State Bar, 421 U.S. 773,\n785 (1975).\n\n                                  29\n\fprofit entity providing rental housing to its clients and is,\n\nthus, itself a commercial actor.20   The Supreme Court has\n\nrecently ratified our understanding of both the commercial and\n\ninterstate nature of renting real property.    The Court’s\n\ndecisions in Jones v. United States, 120 S. Ct. 1904 (2000) and\n\nRussell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858 (1985) make clear that\n\nrenting and otherwise using housing for commercial purposes\n\nimplicates the federal commerce power.21\n\n     In Russell, the defendant was convicted of attempting to\n\nburn down an apartment complex from which he earned rental\n\nincome.   He challenged his conviction stating that the building\n\nwas not commercial or business property and, thus, not an\n\nactivity affecting interstate commerce.    The Court found that\n\n“[t]he rental of real estate is unquestionably” an “activity that\n\naffects commerce.”   Russell, 471 U.S. at 862.   The Court found\n\n\n     20\n        In addition to the commercial aspect of purchasing the\nhome, it must be noted that the granting of reasonable\naccommodations to Alzheimer’s group homes and other homes for\ndisabled individuals also affects the commercial viability of\ncare organizations like Groome Resources. The district court\nfound that the zoning ordinance, with its limitation on four\nunrelated persons, “will make it economically unfeasible for\nplaintiff to operate the proposed home.” The court recognized\nthat the economic viability of this care facility was impeded by\nthe refusal to grant an accommodation.\n     21\n        In both cases, the Court was confronted with the\nstatutory reach of the federal arson statute, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i),\nwhich prohibits the damage or destruction “by means of fire or an\nexplosive, any . . . property used in interstate or foreign\ncommerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign\ncommerce.” 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) (2000).\n\n                                30\n\fdispositive the existing “commercial market” in rental property\n\nas the justification for congressional power to criminalize\n\nostensibly local arson:\n\n        [We] recognize that the local rental of an apartment unit is\n        merely an element of a much broader commercial market in\n        rental properties. The congressional power to regulate the\n        class of activities that constitute the rental market for\n        real estate includes the power to regulate individual\n        activity within that class.\n\nId.22        This recognition was reaffirmed in the recent Jones\n\ndecision.\n\n        In Jones, the Court reversed and remanded a conviction based\n\non § 844(i) involving the fire-bombing of a private residence.\n\nThe Court held that “an owner-occupied residence not used for any\n\ncommercial purpose does not qualify as property ‘used in’\n\ncommerce or commerce-affecting activity.”        Jones, 120 S. Ct. at\n\n1908.        The Jones Court distinguished Russell, finding that the\n\ndispositive fact in that case was that “[p]etitioner was renting\n\nhis apartment building to tenants at the time he attempted to\n\ndestroy it by fire.”        Id. at 1909 (quoting Russell, 471 U.S. at\n\n862)23; see also United States v. Corona, 108 F.3d 565, 570-71\n\n        22\n        The Court relied on the arson statute’s legislative\nhistory to find that the purpose of the statute, “suggests that\nCongress at least intended to protect all business property, as\nwell as some additional property that might not fit that\ndescription, but perhaps not every private home.” Russell, 471\nU.S. at 862.\n        23\n        The Jones Court also posited a functionality test to\ndetermine whether arson of a building is a commerce-affecting\nact. The Court held that “[t]he proper inquiry . . . is into the\nfunction of the building itself, and then a determination of\n\n                                      31\n\f(5th Cir. 1997) (upholding § 844(i) conviction and stating, “[w]e\n\nfind that these convictions comport with the Commerce Clause\n\nbecause of the fact that the fire spread to the United Cab\n\nwarehouse. . . . Not only was the . . . property actually being\n\nrented, but it was serving a commercial rather than a residential\n\npurpose.”).\n\n     In each of these cases, congressional authority for\n\nregulation rested on the rental or commercial use of the\n\nproperty.   As the Groome Resources group home was both a rental\n\nproperty charging monthly rent to its clients and a commercial\n\noperation, we find that the home’s commercial use\n\n“unquestionably” is an “activity that affects commerce.”24   The\n\nfailure to grant a reasonable accommodation to the home is an act\n\n\nwhether that function affects interstate commerce.” Jones, 120\nS. Ct. at 1910. In the instant case, the house is functioning as\na rental unit for disabled individuals, which under Russell can\nbe regulated under the commerce power.\n     24\n          We are mindful of Justice Souter’s dissenting\nadmonition that the Morrison majority had created an unworkable\n“formalistic economic/noneconomic distinction.” 120 S. Ct. at\n1768 (Souter, J., dissenting). While we need not resolve this\nproblem in a factual situation that presents no such issue, the\nlogic of the Jones/Morrison court could suggest that Congress has\nthe constitutional authority to regulate discrimination against\nthe disabled in housing that is rented or otherwise used for\ncommercial purposes, but not regulate the sale or purchase of a\nhome to be used for private uses by the disabled. Of course, the\nregulated activity of arson in Jones is readily distinguishable\nfrom the purchase or sale of a house. In future cases, however,\ncourts may be called upon to resolve the issue of whether housing\ndiscrimination involving purely private actors for private, non-\ncommercial use, substantially affects interstate commerce more\nthan arson and, thus, confront the categorical logic of Jones/\nMorrison.\n\n                                32\n\fof discrimination against the disabled that frustrated an\n\ninterstate commercial transaction, and affected a commercial\n\nendeavor.   Therefore, while not dispositive, these cases support\n\nthe conclusion that we are dealing with a commercial activity\n\nthat falls within the purview of Congress’s regulatory\n\nauthority.25\n\n     We are further supported in our determination that\n\ndiscrimination infringing on the rental, purchase, and sale of\n\nreal estate is activity “economic in nature,” by the broad\n\nreading given to “economic activity” by other courts.    Most\n\nrecently, the Morrison Court provided an expansive reading of\n\neconomic activity that affected interstate commerce, including as\n\nit did Wickard’s regulation of homegrown and home-consumed wheat.\n\nSee 120 S. Ct. at 1750; see also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 574\n\n(recognizing our evolution from “an understanding of commerce\n\n\n     25\n           The Supreme Court has also permitted congressional\nregulation of the interstate sale of real property through the\nSherman Act. In Goldfarb v. Va. State Bar, the Court relied on\nthe interstate nature of real estate title examinations to find\nthat the Sherman Act applied to minimum fee schedules. See 421\nU.S. 773, 785 (1975) (“Given the substantial volume of commerce\ninvolved, and the inseparability of this particular legal service\nfrom the interstate aspects of real estate transactions, we\nconclude that interstate commerce has been sufficiently\naffected.”). Similarly, the Court found Sherman Act jurisdiction\nagainst real estate firms and brokers, because “[i]t is clear\nthat an appreciable amount of commerce is involved in the\nfinancing of residential property . . . and in the insuring of\ntitles to such property. . . [and] this appreciable commercial\nactivity has occurred in interstate commerce.” McLain v. Real\nEstate Bd. Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 245 (1980).\n\n\n                                33\n\fthat would serve only an 18th century economy”); United States v.\n\nBailey, 115 F.3d 1222, 1228 n.7 (5th Cir. 1997) (“The\n\nconstruction of the term ‘commerce’ is a practical one and\n\nembraces economic activity beyond that which is traditionally\n\nconsidered commerce.”).\n\n     A broad reading of “economic” has been accepted in other\n\ncircuits that have addressed the Commerce Clause after Morrison.\n\nFor example, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Gibbs\n\nv. Babbitt upheld a federal statute limiting the taking of red\n\nwolves on private lands based on the economic consequences of the\n\nactivity, including its effect on “red wolf related tourism,”\n\n“scientific research,” and “commercial trade in pelts.”     See 214\n\nF.3d 483, 492 (4th Cir. 2000).   The court recognized the\n\n“breadth” of the concept of economic activity,\n\n     Although the connection to economic or commercial activity\n     plays a central role in whether a regulation will be upheld\n     under the Commerce Clause, economic activity must be\n     understood in broad terms. Indeed, a cramped view of\n     commerce would cripple a foremost federal power and in so\n     doing would eviscerate national authority.\n\nId. at 491; see also United States v. Gregg, 226 F.3d 253, 262\n\n(3d Cir. 2000)26 (“We thus hold that although the connection to\n\neconomic or commercial activity plays a central role in whether a\n\n\n     26\n        In a post-Morrison case, the Gregg court upheld the\nconstitutionality of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances\nAct (FACE) against a Commerce Clause challenge based on a\nrationale that “the misconduct regulated by FACE, although not\nmotivated by commercial concerns, has an effect which is, at its\nessence, economic.” 226 F.3d at 262.\n\n                                 34\n\flaw is valid under the Commerce Clause, we hold that economic\n\nactivity can be understood in broad terms.”).\n\n     This circuit has also recognized a broad reading of\n\ncommercial and economic activities under the Commerce Clause.\n\nSee Bailey, 115 F.3d at 1228 n.7 (finding, under the Child\n\nSupport Recovery Act, that “[c]hild support obligations and their\n\nensuing payments constitute economic activity and are thus\n\nproperly the subject of Commerce Clause regulation”); United\n\nStates v. Threadgill, 172 F.3d 357, 372 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding\n\nthat 18 U.S.C. § 1955, prohibiting illegal gambling, and 31\n\nU.S.C. § 5324, prohibiting unlawful structuring of a currency\n\ntransaction to evade reporting, could be regulated under the\n\nCommerce Clause because both regulate “purely commercial\n\nactivities”); United States v. Bird, 124 F.3d 667, 682 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (upholding a Commerce Clause challenge to the Freedom of\n\nAccess to Clinic Entrances Act on the grounds that Congress could\n\n“ensure the availability of abortion-related services in the\n\nnational commercial market”); United States v. Coleman, 78 F.3d\n\n154, 159 (5th Cir. 1996) (upholding federal car-jacking statute\n\nbecause such “forms of auto theft are crucial to the interstate\n\ncommerce of stolen automobiles and auto parts”).\n\n     As a final point, we must emphasize that in the context of\n\nthe strong tradition of civil rights enforced through the\n\nCommerce Clause — a tradition in which the FHAA firmly sits — we\n\nhave long recognized the broadly defined “economic” aspect of\n\n                               35\n\fdiscrimination.   As the Supreme Court stated in Heart of Atlanta\n\nMotel, Inc. v. United States,\n\n     In framing Title II of [The Civil Rights Act of 1964]\n     Congress was also dealing with what it considered a moral\n     problem. But that fact does not detract from the\n     overwhelming evidence of the disruptive effect that racial\n     discrimination has had on commercial intercourse. It was\n     this burden which empowered Congress to enact appropriate\n     legislation.\n\n379 U.S. 241, 257 (1964) (emphasis added); see also United States\n\nv. Hickman, 179 F.3d 230, 236 (5th Cir. 1999) (Higginbotham, J.,\n\ndissenting from the affirmance of the district court’s judgments\n\nby an equally divided court) (discussing Heart of Atlanta Motel,\n\n“[t]hat this economic regulation also had the goal — even a\n\nlarger goal — of undermining a racist social norm does not defeat\n\nits constitutionality”).27   As long as there is recognition of an\n\n     27\n          The economic effect of housing discrimination against\nthe disabled is equivalent to the economic effect of racial\ndiscrimination in 1964. In fact, parallels were overtly\nrecognized in the congressional debates leading to the passage of\nthe FHAA. For example, in proposing to extend FHA protection to\nhandicapped individuals, Representative Peter W. Rodino stated on\nthe House floor, “I believe . . . [the FHAA] is the logical and\nnecessary next step in our attempt to deal with housing\ndiscrimination. The effort that we began 1966 must be completed,\nso that all Americans can be assured of freedom of choice in\nchoosing their homes.” 134 CONG. REC. H4604 (1988). The powerful\nwords denouncing the local discrimination in Katzenbach v.\nMcClung, therefore are equally relevant to our present situation,\n\n     [W]hile the focus of the legislation was on the individual\n     [actor’s] relation to interstate commerce, Congress\n     appropriately considered the importance of that connection\n     with the knowledge that the discrimination was but\n     representative of many others throughout the country, the\n     total incidence of which if left unchecked may well become\n     far-reaching in its harm to commerce.\n\n\n                                 36\n\finterstate effect, discrimination, even local discrimination, can\n\nbe regulated under Congress’s commerce power.   See Heart of\n\nAtlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 258.\n\n     As the FHAA in general, and the reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision in particular, prohibit discriminatory actions in the\n\npurchase, sale, or rental of housing — commercial transactions\n\nthat have an obvious economic impact — we are satisfied that the\n\nactivity regulated is economic in nature.\n\n\n\n            b.   Congress May Regulate National Markets\n\n     Alternatively, the Lopez Court provided a second, related\n\nanalytical means to justify congressional regulation of\n\nintrastate activity that affects the national market.     See 514\n\nU.S. at 574 (“Congress can regulate in the commercial sphere on\n\nthe assumption that we have a single market and a unified purpose\n\nto build a stable national economy.”) (Kennedy, J.,\n\nconcurring).28   The Court held that regulation is sustainable if\n\nit exists as “an essential part of a larger regulation of\n\n\n379 U.S. 294, 301 (1964) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n     28\n        The Morrison Court did not analyze this aspect of Lopez,\nas there exists no “national market” to protect women from\nviolence. The Court did, however, cite to Justice Kennedy’s\nconcurrence in Lopez, recognizing this means of analysis. See\nMorrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750 (“Lopez did not alter our ‘practical\nconception of commercial regulation’ and that Congress may\n‘regulate in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have\na single market and a unified purpose to build a stable national\neconomy.’”).\n\n                                  37\n\feconomic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be\n\nundercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.”     Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. at 561; see also Hickman, 179 F.3d at 231 (Higginbotham,\n\nJ., dissenting) (“Of course, Congress may protect, enhance, or\n\nrestrict some particular interstate economic market, such as\n\nthose in wheat, credit, minority travel, abortion service,\n\nillegal drugs, and the like, and Congress may regulate intrastate\n\nactivity as part of a broader scheme.”); Bird, 124 F.3d at 682.\n\n     This understanding of the Commerce Clause power has a long\n\nlineage in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence,\n\n     A complex regulatory program . . . can survive a Commerce\n     Clause challenge without a showing that every single facet\n     of the program is independently and directly related to a\n     valid congressional goal. It is enough that the challenged\n     provisions are an integral part of the regulatory program\n     and that the regulatory scheme when considered as a whole\n     satisfies this test.\n\nHodel v. Indiana, 452 U.S. 314, 329 n.17 (1981) (collecting\n\ncases); see also Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794,\n\n803 (1976) (recognizing “the premise, well established by the\n\nhistory of the Commerce Clause, that this nation is a common\n\nmarket”); Gibbs v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 483, 497 (4th Cir. 2000)\n\n(recognizing same in post-Morrison case).\n\n     In the context of fair housing, Congress has manifested its\n\nplain intent to prohibit discrimination in the national market\n\nfor housing.   See 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of the\n\nUnited States to provide within constitutional limitations, for\n\nfair housing throughout the United States.”(emphasis added)).\n\n                                38\n\fCongress acted in response to the recognition that in a mobile\n\nsociety in which people and families move within states and\n\nlocalities, and where local land use laws affect the movement of\n\npeople, there is a national effect on housing materials, economic\n\ndevelopment, and growth of certain restricted areas.29    The\n\nreasonable accommodations provision is but one means by which to\n\nprevent housing discrimination against disabled individuals, and\n\nthus, one means to counteract the economic effect of housing\n\ndiscrimination at the national level.\n\n     “Where the class of activities is regulated and that class\n\nis within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to\n\nexcise, as trivial, individual instances of the class.”    Perez v.\n\nUnited States, 402 U.S. 146, 154 (1971).    Therefore, the Parish’s\n\nchallenge to the reasonable accommodations provision must be\n\nevaluated in the context of the entire statute.    See Lopez, 514\n\nU.S. at 558 (“Where a general regulatory statute bears a\n\nsubstantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of\n\nindividual instances arising under that statute is of no\n\nconsequence.” (quoting Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 197\n\n(1968)).    Undertaking that analysis, we are satisfied that since\n\n§ 3604 affects the interstate market for housing, we must uphold\n\nthe individual provisions of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n     29\n           See infra notes 34 & 35.\n\n                                  39\n\f     In similar fashion, the national regulation of fair housing\n\nalso undermines the Parish’s “local land use” argument.    Local\n\nefforts to exclude the disabled from the community by refusing to\n\nprovide reasonable accommodations to zoning laws, may be\n\nregulated on a federal level if that local refusal affects the\n\nnational economy.   See Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 258\n\n(“[I]f it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does\n\nnot matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze.”\n\n(citations omitted)).   Thus, that the act of discrimination takes\n\nplace on a local stage is of no moment, because when Congress has\n\nchosen a national arena to regulate, every actor that affects\n\ncommerce is subject to regulation.\n\n     Because the Parish’s decision to deny Groome Resources a\n\nreasonable accommodation is inextricably tied to the economic\n\nactivity of buying a home and the commercial activity of\n\noperating a rental-based Alzheimer’s care facility, and the\n\nculmination of many such activities could rationally be\n\ndetermined to have a substantial effect on the national housing\n\nmarket, we find that under the Lopez-Morrison rational basis\n\ntest, Congress acted within its Commerce Clause authority.\n\n     Therefore, under both of the recognized means of regulation\n\nanalyzed in Lopez, we find Morrison’s first question — of whether\n\nthe activity is economic or commercial in nature — to be\n\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\n                                40\n\f           2. There Is No Express Jurisdictional Element\n\n      As the FHAA has no express jurisdictional element, we need\n\nnot belabor this second prong of the Morrison analysis.      See\n\nMorrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750-51 (finding that a jurisdictional\n\nelement could assist constitutional interpretation by providing\n\n“an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce”);\n\nsee also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561-62 (requiring a jurisdictional\n\nelement to facilitate a “case-by-case inquiry” into the\n\ninterstate “nexus”).\n\n      We do note, however, that the requirement of a\n\njurisdictional element in both Morrison and Lopez is relevant\n\nonly because there was no obvious interstate economic connection\n\nin those cases, involving as they did, non-economic and\n\nintrastate activities.   While we do not rest our holding on this\n\nfactor, the explicit economic nature of commercial housing used\n\nfor rental purposes and the economic effect of discrimination on\n\nthe national housing market (as detailed above) presents a very\n\ndifferent situation than cases challenging non-economic and non-\n\ncommercial regulatory acts.\n\n\n\n 3.   The Legislative History of the FHAA Supports the Interstate\n\n         Nature of the Reasonable Accommodations Provision\n\n      The third prong of Morrison asks whether the legislative\n\nhistory of the Act provides insight into the “legislative\n\njudgment that the activity in question substantially affects\n\n                                41\n\finterstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect is\n\nvisible to the naked eye.”   120 S. Ct. at 1751.   As is evidenced\n\nby the interstate, economic nature of housing discrimination\n\ndiscussed previously, we are not dealing with an invisible\n\neffect.\n\n     Nevertheless, following the dictates of Morrison, we find\n\nthe legislative action that resulted in the passage of the FHAA\n\nto have recognized a pattern of discrimination that affected the\n\ninterstate housing market and the creation of commercial group\n\nhomes for handicapped individuals.

Knutson, 113 F.3d 27, 30 (5th Cir. 1997).   This memory\n\nincludes not only the anti-discriminatory purpose of the FHAA,\n\nbut also the FHA.   See Seniors Civil Liberties Ass’n v.

REC. S10552 (1988).   As\n\nthe connection between racial discrimination and its affect on\n\ninterstate commerce had been established in Heart of Atlanta\n\nMotel and McClung, Congress was well within its institutional\n\nauthority to act to prevent discrimination against the disabled.\n\n     Lopez directs us to “consider legislative findings, and\n\nindeed even congressional committee findings, regarding effect on\n\ninterstate commerce.”   514 U.S. at 563.37   However, the Court\n\n\nseveral ways. The confinement of Negroes and other minority\ngroups to older homes in ghettoes restricts the number of new\nhomes which are built and consequently reduces the amount of\nbuilding materials and residential financing which moves across\nstate lines. Negroes, especially those in the professions or in\nbusiness, are less likely to change their place of residence to\nanother state when housing discrimination would force them to\nmove their families into ghettoes; the result is both to reduce\nthe interstate movement of individuals and to hinder the\nefficient allocation of labor among the interstate components of\nthe economy. The Commerce Clause grants Congress plenary power\nto protect interstate commerce from adverse effects such as\nthese.”); id. at 129 (statement of Rev. Robert F. Drinan, Dean,\nBoston College Law School) (discussing power of Congress under\nthe Commerce Clause).\n     Testimony on the FHAA also demonstrated that handicapped\nand mentally ill individuals are segregated in housing options\nthat do not provide an equal opportunity in housing. See supra\nnote 34.\n     37\n        The Commerce Clause was explicitly referenced in the\nSenate debates on the FHAA, albeit in terms of the regulation of\nhousing construction to fit the special needs of the disabled.\n     The debate between Senator Symms and Senator Specter\ndemonstrates the concern over this issue:\n\n\n                                45\n\falso recognized, “Congress normally is not required to make\n\nformal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity\n\nhas on interstate commerce.”     Id.\n\n     In the instant case, we are satisfied that the legislative\n\nrecord is replete with informal findings connecting direct\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled with the larger and more\n\nsubtle effects on the interstate supply of housing.38   Congress\n\n\n     Mr. Symms. The question that I have, Mr. President, is when\n     we talk about who is enlightened and who is not enlightened,\n     when I look at the building codes in the United States as\n     opposed to the nonmarket countries, we have it way the best,\n     yet we are trying to impose the long nose of the Federal\n     Government into the size of bathrooms.     And my question\n     would be to one of the learned Senators on the floor: What\n     clause in the Constitution gives the Federal Government the\n     right to go in and set the size of bathrooms and building\n     codes?    Is this in the 13th amendment or is it from the\n     commerce clause in the Constitution? Where does this come\n     from?   Is this even constitutional?     That is my question.\n     *   *   *    *   *\n     Mr. Specter. Mr. President, I would be delighted to respond\n     to the question.    The commerce clause.\n     Mr. Symms. The Senator says the commerce clause.     Does the\n     size of bathrooms in multiunit housing affect the commerce\n     clause?\n     Mr. Specter. Yes.\n     Mr. Symms. How?\n     Mr. Specter. Because the Commerce Clause touches the\n     construction of housing where the materials passed in\n     interstate commerce.    Where there is a determination by the\n     Congress of the United States that interstate commerce is\n     affected, the decisions by the Supreme Court of the United\n     States are clear that it may reach issues like housing\n     comprehended by this Fair Housing Act.\n\n 134 CONG. REC. S10541 (1988).\n     38\n        Particularly, we note that the legislative record\ndemonstrates a concern about group homes being discriminated\nagainst through zoning mechanisms: “[The FHAA] is intended to\nprohibit special restrictive covenants or other terms or\n\n                                  46\n\fheard testimony about the lack of adequate housing for disabled\n\nindividuals,39 the overt discrimination against college\n\nstudents,40 paralyzed veterans returning home from war,41 disabled\n\nmilitary spouses required to move interstate after their husbands\n\nwere transferred,42 and other instances of discrimination that\n\nplaced burdens on the interstate movement of persons and\n\n\n\nconditions . . . which have the effect of excluding, for example,\ncongregate living arrangements for persons with handicaps.” H.R.\nREP.

Days, III, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights\nDivision, Department of Justice) (“[W]e have learned of serious\nimpediments to the establishment of group homes for handicapped\npersons who are being de-institutionalized.

See McClung, 379 U.S. at 299.\n\n     This testimony, supported by legal briefs discussing\n\nCongress’s constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause, is\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that Congress was acting with\n\nconsidered legislative judgment.      Under a Lopez-Morrison\n\nanalysis, the legislative record suffices to demonstrate that\n\nCongress had a rational basis to prohibit housing discrimination\n\nbecause of its effect on interstate commerce.     We recognize\n\n“whether particular operations affect interstate commerce\n\nsufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress\n\nto regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a\n\nlegislative question.”    Morrison, 120 S. Ct. 1752 (quoting Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. at 557).   However, on the facts presented, we are\n\nsatisfied that Congress acted within its constitutional authority\n\nin enacting the FHAA.\n\n\n\n4. The Connection Between the Reasonable Accommodations Provision\n\n           and Interstate Commerce Is Not Too Attenuated\n\n     The final factor for analysis under Morrison is an\n\nattenuation analysis.    In Lopez, the Supreme Court rejected the\n\ngovernment’s attempt to argue that because the possession of guns\n\n\n     43\n          See supra note 34.\n\n                                 48\n\fmay lead to violent crime, and that crime can affect the national\n\neconomy by increasing costs through insurance and decreasing\n\n“national productivity,” there is a connection between possession\n\nof guns and interstate commerce.      Similarly, in Morrison, the\n\nCourt reaffirmed that there must be a more direct connection\n\nbetween the regulation of violence against women and interstate\n\ncommerce.    See Morrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1751 (“[In Lopez] [w]e\n\nrejected these ‘costs of crime’ and ‘national productivity’\n\narguments because they would permit Congress to ‘regulate not\n\nonly all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to\n\nviolent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to\n\ninterstate commerce.”).\n\n     The attenuation argument in the instant case need not detain\n\nus long.    Unlike the need for several logical links to connect\n\nthe regulated activity with commerce as in Lopez and Morrison,\n\nhere the link is direct.    We do not need to pile “inference upon\n\ninference” to see that by refusing to reasonably accommodate the\n\ndisabled by discriminatory zoning laws, there will be less\n\nopportunity for handicapped individuals to buy, sell, or rent\n\nhomes.   The attendant financial loss to the economy from Groome\n\nResources’ failed attempt to purchase such a house in Louisiana\n\nis a case in point.\n\n     The testimony presented to Congress well demonstrated that\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled impeded housing rentals,\n\npurchases, and interstate travel.     Therefore, the regulation of\n\n                                 49\n\fdiscriminatory policies in the purchase or rental of housing\n\ndirectly affects the housing industry and the economy.     Further,\n\nwe are bound by the logic of Heart of Atlanta and McClung, where\n\nsuch a link between discrimination and commerce was ratified by\n\nthe Supreme Court.    See McClung, 379 U.S. at 299-301 (discussing\n\nHeart of Atlanta Motel).\n\n\n\n                 5. Conclusion on the Commerce Clause\n\n     There is, however, a deeper concern embedded in the\n\nattenuation analysis that implicates a structural issue of\n\nfederalism.   The Morrison/Lopez courts were concerned about\n\nunbounded federal power, and a concomitant federal invasion into\n\nareas of traditional state authority.\n\n     We are therefore cognizant and respectful of Morrison’s\n\nconcern with the “distinction between what is truly national and\n\nwhat is truly local.”    120 S. Ct. at 1754.   We are persuaded,\n\nhowever, that housing discrimination against the disabled is a\n\nnational concern that substantially affects the economic health\n\nof the nation.    While states and localities retain broad powers\n\nto regulate and zone land within their jurisdictions, see Village\n\nof Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 393 (1926), this\n\nlocal land use authority cannot defeat congressional action\n\npredicated on a nexus between discrimination and commerce.\n\n     The discriminatory application of local land use authority\n\nimplicates the central concern of federalism as articulated by\n\n                                  50\n\fLopez and Morrison — namely that federalizing certain spheres of\n\nauthority blurs the federal/state distinction, undermining\n\npolitical accountability and impeding local experimentation:\n\n     Federalism serves to assign political responsibility, not to\n     obscure it. . . . Were the Federal Government to take over\n     the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern,\n     areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercial\n     activities, the boundaries between the spheres of federal\n     and state authority would blur and political responsibility\n     would become illusory.\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 577 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citations\n\nomitted); see also id. at 581 (“If a State or municipality\n\ndetermines that harsh criminal sanctions are necessary and wise\n\nto deter students from carrying guns on school premises, the\n\nreserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those\n\nmeasures.”); id. at 583 (“The statute now before us forecloses\n\nthe States from experimenting and exercising their own judgment\n\nin an area to which States lay claim by right of history and\n\nexpertise.”).\n\n     “Our Federalism,” however, is not threatened here.     While\n\nthe incantation of “local zoning” and “traditional” authority is\n\npresent in this case, in substance, the issue before this court\n\npresents no federalism difficulty.    Unlike Lopez or Morrison, it\n\ndoes not serve the balance of federalism to allow local\n\ncommunities to discriminate against the disabled.   Local\n\nauthorities cannot “experiment” by creating communities that\n\nexclude the disabled any more than local authorities can\n\nexperiment by excluding minorities.   Further, the FHAA was passed\n\n                               51\n\fprecisely because the political voice of the disabled was\n\nsilenced in local debates as they were not allowed to move into\n\nthe neighborhood in the first instance.44   The values of\n\npolitical accountability and experimentation, in fact, may be\n\nstrengthened by the reasonable accommodations provision allowing\n\nthe disabled an equal opportunity to live and participate in our\n\ncommunities, and thus change society through the local democratic\n\nprocess.\n\n     To be clear, nothing in this analysis supports the argument\n\nthat the federal government can regulate the intricacies of local\n\nzoning decisions.   In fact, the vast majority of local zoning\n\ndecisions support the rationale of federalism, providing\n\npolitical accountability and flexibility through local control.\n\nNeither the reasonable accommodations provision nor the FHAA\n\npurports to change this balance of power.45   See Bryant Woods Inn\n\nInc. v. Howard County Md., 124 F.3d 597, 603 (4th Cir. 1997) (“In\n\n\n     44\n          Testimony regarding the problem of discriminatory\nzoning rules targeting group homes, and therefore their exclusion\nfrom the community, was heard in congressional hearings in 1979,\n1986, and 1987. See supra note 38.\n     45\n        Of course, there is also nothing that allows local\nofficials to avoid federal or constitutional requirements. There\nis ample history of local land use being regulated when the\nproper constitutional authorities require it. See, e.g., City of\nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 434 (1985)\n(invalidating municipal zoning ordinance that discriminated\nagainst mentally retarded citizens); Moore v. City of East\nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 499 (1977) (invalidating local housing\nordinance that limited occupancy of a dwelling to a circumscribed\ndefinition of family).\n\n                                52\n\fenacting the FHA, Congress clearly did not contemplate abandoning\n\nthe deference that courts have traditionally shown to such local\n\nzoning codes.”); see also Oxford House-C v. City of St. Louis, 77\n\nF.3d 249, 253 (8th Cir. 1996) (“Congress also did not intend the\n\nfederal courts to act as zoning boards.”).\n\n      While federal courts are ill-equipped to act as zoning\n\nboards, we have, however, proved competent in enforcing anti-\n\ndiscrimination provisions enacted pursuant to the proper\n\nconstitutional authority.46   The challenged reasonable\n\naccommodations provision simply prohibits discrimination in\n\nhousing against the disabled by providing equal access to housing\n\noptions.   Because housing discrimination against certain members\n\nof society is shown to affect interstate commerce, and that\n\ndiscrimination is directly the result of local bias, it is well\n\nwithin Congress’s power to provide measures such as the\n\nreasonable accommodations provision to prohibit that\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n     We end our discussion of § 3604(f)(3)(B) where Morrison\n\nbegan its analysis: “Due respect for the decisions of a\n\ncoordinate branch of Government demands that we invalidate a\n\ncongressional enactment only upon a plain showing that Congress\n\nhas exceeded its constitutional bounds.”     120 S. Ct. at 1748.\n\n     46\n        See e.g., Hovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d\n1096, 1103-05 (3d Cir. 1996); Oxford House-C v. City of St.\nLouis, 77 F.3d 249, 251 (8th Cir. 1996); Seniors Civil Liberties\nAss’n, 965 F.2d at 1036.\n\n                                 53\n\fFollowing Morrison, we hold that Congress did not exceed its\n\nbounds in determining that the decision to grant or deny\n\nreasonable accommodations to a disabled buyer or renter of real\n\nproperty was an activity “economic in nature,” and that Congress\n\ncan well prohibit discrimination in the national market for\n\nhousing.    See id. at 1751.   We are supported in our conclusion\n\nthat Congress had a rational basis for its regulation by the\n\nlengthy legislative record of the FHAA, and the direct effect the\n\nanti-discriminatory regulation has on interstate commerce.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we hold that § 3604(f)(3)(B) was\n\nenacted pursuant to Congress’s legitimate authority under the\n\nCommerce Clause and affirm the district court’s grant of an\n\ninjunction against the Parish of Jefferson.\n\n\n\n        D. The Reasonable Accommodations Provision Is Not\n\n                      Unconstitutionally Vague\n\n     The Parish argues that even if we find § 3604(f)(3)(B) to be\n\na valid exercise of Congress’s commerce power, the reasonable\n\naccommodations provision is unconstitutionally vague.    We\n\ndisagree.\n\n     “A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it does not give a\n\n‘person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know\n\nwhat is prohibited.’”    United States v. Bird, 124 F.3d 667, 683\n\n(5th Cir. 1997) (quoting Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.\n\n104, 108 (1972)).   The void-for-vagueness doctrine has been\n\n                                  54\n\fprimarily employed to strike down criminal laws.    See Okpalobi v.\n\nFoster, 190 F.3d 337, 358 n.10 (5th Cir. 1999).    In the civil\n\ncontext, “the statute must be ‘so vague and indefinite as really\n\nto be no rule at all.’”   Seniors Civil Liberties Ass’n v. Kemp,\n\n965 F.2d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir. 1992) (quoting Boutilier v. INS,\n\n387 U.S. 118, 123 (1967)).\n\n     Applying this standard, we find no merit in the Parish’s\n\ncontention that the provision is vague.   In the first instance,\n\nthe reasonable accommodations terminology had a workable meaning\n\neven before Congress adopted it in the FHAA.   The legislative\n\nhistory of the FHAA demonstrates that Congress chose the\n\nreasonable accommodations language because “the concept of\n\nreasonable accommodations has a long history in regulations and\n\ncase law dealing with discrimination on the basis of handicap.”\n\nH.R. REP. NO. 100-711, at 25 (1988), reprinted in 1988\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2173, 2186 (citing Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v.\n\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, 410-12 (1979)).\n\n     This long history of interpretation has continued to the\n\npresent day as many of our sister circuits have interpreted the\n\nreasonable accommodations provision without constitutional\n\ndifficulty.   See, e.g., Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County,\n\nMd. 124 F.3d 597, 602 (4th Cir. 1997); Smith & Lee Assocs., Inc.\n\nv. City of Taylor, Mich., 102 F.3d 781, 794-96 (6th Cir. 1996);\n\nHovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d 1096, 1103-05 (3d\n\nCir. 1996); Oxford House-C v. City of St. Louis, 77 F.3d 249, 251\n\n                                55\n\f(8th Cir. 1996); Seniors Civil Liberties Ass’n, 965 F.2d at 1036.\n\nThese cases, and the numerous district court decisions\n\ninterpreting the reasonable accommodations language, undermine\n\nthe Parish’s contention that the provision is unclear or\n\nunworkable and certainly vitiates the argument that the provision\n\nis equivalent “to being no rule at all”.     Seniors Civil Liberties\n\nAss’n, 965 F.2d at 1036.   We conclude that the reasonable\n\naccommodations language is neither vague nor indefinite, and\n\ntherefore reject the Parish’s void-for-vagueness challenge.\n\n\n\n                           V.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                  56\n\f",

(“Groome Resources”).   The permanent injunction enjoined\n\nthe Parish from interfering with or withholding approval of\n\fGroome Resources’ application for “reasonable accommodations”\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B) to operate a for-profit group\n\nhome for five individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nSpecifically, the Parish raises a constitutional challenge to the\n\nstatutory basis of the district court’s injunction.   The Parish\n\nargues that Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in\n\npassing § 3604(f)(3)(B) of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of\n\n1988 (FHAA),1 which defines housing discrimination to include a\n\nrefusal to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped\n\nindividuals.   We join three circuits in concluding that Congress\n\nacted under its Commerce Clause power in enacting the FHAA, and\n\nbecause, under the facts presented, Groome Resources is a for-\n\nprofit company engaged in and substantially affecting interstate\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Section 3604 reads in relevant part:\n\n           It shall be unlawful—\n         . . .\n           (f) To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to\n           otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\n           buyer or renter because of a handicap-\n         . . .\n           (3) For purposes of this subsection, discrimination\n           includes–\n         . . .\n           (B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in\n                rules, policies, practices, or services, when such\n                accommodations may be necessary to afford such\n                person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a\n                dwelling . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\n\n                                 2\n\fcommerce, we AFFIRM the district court.   See U.S. CONST. art. I,\n\n§ 8, cl. 3.\n\n\n\n\n               I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Groome Resources is a for-profit limited liability\n\npartnership that operates group homes for individuals afflicted\n\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.   These homes provide full-time\n\nsupervision, food, shelter, and supportive services for elderly\n\npatients who are unable to live independently due to their\n\nillness.   Each home cares for five Alzheimer’s patients and is\n\nstaffed by a full-time, rotating caretaker.   Each patient pays\n\n$3,400 per month for his or her accommodations and care.    Groome\n\nResources currently operates four group homes in the Greater New\n\nOrleans area and seeks to open a fifth in a residential district\n\nof the Parish of Jefferson.\n\n     To facilitate this expansion, on February 8, 1999, Groome\n\nResources signed a contract to purchase a home at 5109 Elmwood\n\nParkway located in the Parish.   The contract was between Groome\n\nResources and the seller, Cendant Mobility Services Corporation,\n\na national relocation assistance organization.   The agreement to\n\npurchase was contingent on Groome Resources obtaining a variance\n\nto the local zoning laws, which would permit the operation of a\n\ngroup home for five unrelated individuals operated for profit.\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fGroome Resources had scheduled a closing date for the home for\n\none month from the signing.\n\n     The Parish zoning ordinance at issue regulates property use\n\nin single-family residential districts.       The zoning ordinance\n\nprovides,\n\n     This district is composed of certain lands and structures\n     having a low density, single family residential character\n     and additional open area where it is desirable and likely\n     that such similar development will occur. Uses are limited\n     to single family residences and such non-residential uses as\n     are intended primarily to provide service to the adjacent\n     neighborhood.\n\nJEFFERSON PARISH, LA., COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE, § VII-A, at 7A-1,\n\nno. 1 (1998).    The zoning ordinance defines “family” as,\n\n     one or more persons related by blood or marriage living\n     together and occupying a single housekeeping unit with\n     single culinary facilities or a group of not more than four\n     persons living together by mutual agreement and occupying a\n     single housekeeping unit with single culinary facilities on\n     a non-profit cost-sharing basis.\n\nId. § III, at 3-6, no. 25.\n\n     The Parish zoning ordinance also provides a process by which\n\nreasonable accommodations can be made for handicapped residents\n\nunder the Fair Housing Amendments Act:\n\n     Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent a\n     reasonable accommodation for handicapped persons as defined\n     by the Federal Fair Housing Act in accordance with Federal,\n     State and Parish procedures. Application for reasonable\n     accommodation shall be submitted to the Department of\n     Inspection and Code Enforcement for review and approval.\n\nId. § XX, at 20-25, no. 14.      On February 11, 1999, Groome\n\nResources applied for a “reasonable accommodation” to allow the\n\nproposed group home for five non-related individuals to operate\n\n                                    4\n\fin a single-family dwelling on a for-profit basis.   Groome\n\nResources had successfully applied for a similar group home in\n\nanother residential district in the Parish, a request that had\n\nbeen granted within forty-five days.\n\n     Under the procedures set up by the Parish, an application\n\nfor reasonable accommodations must be reviewed by the Department\n\nof Inspection and Code Enforcement and the Parish Attorney’s\n\nOffice. There is no formalized procedure or timetable for an\n\napplication, although the target timetable is forty-five days.\n\nIn addition, the councilman in whose district the property sits\n\nand the residents of the district are notified about the\n\napplication.\n\n     On March 15, 1999, the Parish Attorney’s Office recommended\n\napproval of Groome Resources’ application for reasonable\n\naccommodations for the Elmwood Parkway group home.   On March 16,\n\n1999, the director of the Department of Inspection and Code\n\nEnforcement also recommended approval of the application.\n\nSeveral days later, however, members of the Elmwood Park Civic\n\nAssociation, through their councilman, voiced opposition to the\n\napplication.   On March 19, 1999, residents of the neighborhood,\n\nthe councilman and the Parish Attorney met to discuss the planned\n\ngroup home.2   Due to the opposition of the residents, no official\n\n     2\n        A March 20, 1999 letter from Libby Olivier Tittle, 1st\nVice President of the Elmwood Park Civic Association, to\nCouncilman Edmond J. Muniz, included in the record, evidences the\ncommunity sentiment toward the group home. Entitled “Elmwood\n\n                                 5\n\fdecision was made regarding the Groome Resources reasonable\n\naccommodations application.\n\n     On April 28, 1999, Groome Resources wrote to the Parish to\n\ninquire about its pending application.3   The letter threatened\n\nlegal action pursuant to the FHAA if the reasonable\n\naccommodations request was not decided upon.   Groome Resources\n\nexplained that, due to the delay, it had accrued monetary damages\n\nrelated to the rescheduling of the closing date on the property.\n\nThe Parish responded by letter on April 30, 1999, stating that\n\nthe application remained under review and further information\n\nmight be requested.   On May 4, 1999, the Parish requested\n\nadditional information on the Groome Resources company and the\n\n\nPark Civic Association’s Opposition to Group Home at 5109 Elmwood\nParkway,” the letter summarizes the meeting between the neighbors\nand the councilman. In relevant part it states:\n\n     The permit has not yet been granted and will be delayed to\n     allow both Tom Wilkinson, Parish Attorney, and our Civic\n     Association to prepare to challenge the opening and\n     operating of this group home.\n     . . .\n     (2) You [Councilman Muniz] oppose the granting of the\n     permit. Tom Wilkinson will recommend that the Parish\n     Council not approve the permit because it could be a good\n     test case to challenge these group homes in R-1 classified\n     zones.\n\nLetter from Libby Olivier Tittle, 1st Vice President of the\nElmwood Park Civic Association to Councilman Edmond J. Muniz\n(March 20, 1999).\n     3\n        The United States Justice Department, Civil Rights\nDivision also wrote to the Parish on May 6, 1999, inquiring about\nthe status of Groome Resources’ application. The Parish\nAttorney, Thomas Wilkinson, informed the Justice Department that\nthe application was under review.\n\n                                 6\n\fproposal for the Elmwood Parkway group home.    On May 12, 1999,\n\nGroome Resources submitted the requested information to the\n\nParish.    On May 14, 1999, Groome Resources filed suit in federal\n\ndistrict court seeking injunctive relief “enjoining and\n\nrestraining the [Parish] from withholding approval of [the]\n\nApplication for Reasonable Accommodation.”\n\n     Groome Resources argued that the Parish’s continued delay\n\nfrustrated the purpose of the FHAA and was tantamount to a denial\n\nof its reasonable accommodations application.    As such, Groome\n\nResources argued it was discriminated against under the FHAA and\n\nsought an injunction to remedy that discrimination.    In response,\n\nthe Parish argued that the suit was premature as no final\n\ndecision had been made on the application, that Groome Resources\n\ncould not meet the procedural or substantive requirements for an\n\ninjunction, and that the enactment of the reasonable\n\naccommodations provision exceeded the constitutional authority of\n\nCongress.\n\n     The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Groome\n\nResources’ motion for a preliminary injunction and consolidated\n\nit with a trial on the merits.   The district court held that the\n\nFHAA was “a valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Commerce\n\nClause.”    Further, it found that despite the fact that the Parish\n\nhad never formally denied Groome Resources’ application, the case\n\nwas ripe for decision.   Deposition testimony revealed that there\n\nwas no planned action on the application, and the district court\n\n                                  7\n\ffound that the attorney in charge of the review process “could\n\nnot say what the current status of the application was, what if\n\nanything remained to be done to complete the process or when it\n\nmight be done, and could not say who the ultimate decision maker\n\nwould be.”   The district court concluded that “the Parish delayed\n\nacting on the application in the hope that the matter will become\n\nmoot if the proposed purchase falls through.”   Therefore, “to\n\ndeny plaintiff’s claim as premature would effectively frustrate\n\nthe clear mandates of the Fair Housing Act.”\n\n     In determining the merits of the reasonable accommodations\n\napplication, the district court found that the addition of one\n\nperson to the four person limit was reasonable and necessary to\n\nallow individuals with Alzheimer’s disease an equal opportunity\n\nto live in a residential setting, and that “[t]he trial evidence\n\nconvinces the Court that the artificial limit of four unrelated\n\npersons living in a single group home will make it economically\n\nunfeasible for [Groome Resources] to operate the proposed home.”\n\nThe district court concluded,\n\n     The other homes operated by Groome have been well received\n     by their residential neighbors. Since none of the residents\n     drive, there are few if any automobiles at the homes. There\n     is absolutely no evidence that this proposed group home with\n     five Alzheimer’s patients would cause any problems or in any\n     way impact the health, safety, welfare or character of the\n     neighborhood. If the home was occupied by a family, there\n     would be no limit on the number of persons who reside there,\n     or the number of automobiles or visitors at the home. In\n     fact, the same residential zoning permits small home\n     businesses, schools, and day care centers, all of which\n     cause more congestion and traffic problems than is expected\n     from the group home. The requested accommodation is clearly\n\n                                 8\n\f     reasonable and necessary to allow the handicapped to have\n     equal opportunity to live in residential settings of their\n     choice, as mandated by the Fair Housing Act Amendments of\n     1988.\n\nAccordingly, the district court permanently enjoined the Parish\n\nfrom interfering with or withholding approval of a reasonable\n\naccommodations application for Groome Resources.\n\n     On appeal, the Parish challenges the constitutional basis of\n\nthe district court’s holding — namely the constitutional\n\nauthority of Congress to pass 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B).   First,\n\nthe Parish argues that Congress exceeded its authority under the\n\nCommerce Clause in enacting the “reasonable accommodations”\n\nclause.   Second, the Parish argues in the alternative that\n\n§ 3604(f)(3)(B)’s reasonable accommodations standard, as applied\n\nto facially neutral zoning ordinances, is void for vagueness.4\n\nAfter careful interpretation of the legislative history of the\n\n\n\n     4\n        We accept that the Parish has properly appealed the\nconstitutionality of § 3604(f)(3)(B) and dismiss Groome\nResources’ procedural challenges to this appeal. First, we\ndisagree with Groome Resources’ contention that the district\ncourt’s injunction rested on a finding of disparate impact and,\nthus, remains in effect regardless of our decision on the\nconstitutionality of the reasonable accommodations provision of\nthe FHAA. The focus of the injunction was clearly the failure of\nthe Parish to provide reasonable accommodations for the proposed\ngroup home and not a finding that there was a discriminatory\nintent or effect on handicapped individuals in the Parish.\nSecond, we disagree with Groome Resources’ argument that the\nParish’s failure to brief in detail a Fourteenth Amendment\nchallenge to the FHAA is fatal to its overarching constitutional\nchallenge. The district court expressly held that the FHAA “was\na valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.”\nIt is from that finding that the Parish based its appeal.\n\n                                 9\n\fFHAA, and an analysis of the Supreme Court’s recent Commerce\n\nClause cases, we affirm the holding of the district court.5\n\n\n\n                       II.

We find that the district court\n\nwas correct in resolving the legal question of whether the Parish\n\nhad failed to approve Groome Resources’ reasonable accommodations\n\napplication for its group home, and that the hardship to Groome\n\nResources constituted an immediate injury requiring judicial\n\nrelief.\n\n     First, as to the “fitness of the issues for judicial\n\ndecision,” we agree with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\n\nCircuit that “[u]nder the Fair Housing Act . . . a violation\n\noccurs when the disabled resident is first denied a reasonable\n\naccommodation, irrespective of the remedies granted in subsequent\n\n                                11\n\fproceedings.”   Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v.

In the instant case, the district court was\n\nwell within its discretion to decide that a reasonable\n\naccommodation was denied by the unjustified delay of the Parish\n\nofficials.\n\n     From the facts at trial, a full and complete application had\n\nbeen submitted and been reviewed.7     The district court recognized\n\nthat ninety-five days had elapsed between the time the\n\napplication was submitted and the filing of the lawsuit, and\n\ndespite the target date of forty-five days, the application had\n\nbeen pending for 127 days without action at the time of the\n\ncourt’s decision.   During this time, Groome Resources was\n\n\n\n\n     6\n        As such, ripeness in the Fair Housing Act context must\nbe distinguished from ripeness cases involving unconstitutional\ntakings or other zoning issues. See Bryant, 124 F.3d at 602\n(“Fair Housing Act claims are thus unlike takings claims, which\ndo not ripen until post-decisional procedures are invoked without\nachieving a just compensation.”).\n     7\n        Persuasive to the district court was the fact that the\nonly two governmental departments that needed to approve the\nreasonable accommodations application had unofficially approved\nthe application in March. The effect of the intervention of the\ndistrict councilman and the Parish residents was evident as\napproval by the councilman or the residents was not required in\nthe process.

In addition to the discriminatory injury\n\nnecessitating judicial relief, Groome Resources faces concrete\n\neconomic hardship from the continued delay.   The district court\n\nfound that Groome Resources would be liable for a $2000 penalty\n\nfor the delay in closing, not to mention the economic loss of\n\nbeing unable to operate the facility.   Further delay in obtaining\n\njudicial resolution of this issue will likely cause additional\n\n     8\n        The district court was even forced to intervene on\nbehalf of Groome Resources to secure one of the postponements in\nthe closing date and found in its opinion that “[the closing]\nlikely will not be extended further.”\n\n                                13\n\fharm to Groome Resources.

After a brief examination of the purpose of the\n\nFHAA, and the controlling Commerce Clause jurisprudence, we\n\nconsider the constitutionality of the FHAA and the reasonable\n\naccommodations provision now challenged by the Parish.\n\n\n\n           A. Purpose of the Fair Housing Amendments Act\n\n     In response to a history of national discrimination against\n\nindividuals with disabilities, Congress enacted the FHAA in\n\n1988.9   The purpose of the Act was to prohibit discrimination in\n\n     9\n         Section 3604 provides in pertinent part:\n\n     [I]t shall be unlawful–\n        . . . .\n     (f) (1) To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to\n               otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to\n               any buyer or renter because of a handicap of–\n\n                (A) that buyer or renter,\n                (B) a person residing in or intending to reside in\n                that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made\n                available; or\n                (C) any person associated with that buyer or\n                renter.\n\n           (2) To discriminate against any person in the terms,\n              conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a\n              dwelling, or in the provision of services or\n              facilities in connection with such dwelling,\n              because of a handicap of—\n\n                                15\n\fthe national housing market for handicapped10 individuals.    As\n\nthe House Report stated,\n\n     The Fair Housing Amendments Act . . . is a clear\n     pronouncement of a national commitment to end the\n     unnecessary exclusion of persons with handicaps from the\n     American mainstream. It repudiates the use of stereotypes\n     and ignorance, and mandates that persons with handicaps be\n     considered as individuals. Generalized perceptions about\n     disabilities and unfounded speculations about threats to\n     safety are specifically rejected as grounds to justify\n     exclusion.\n\nH.R. REP.

As in\n\nCleburne, Congress took particular note of how local zoning laws\n\nhad been used to discriminate and thus affect housing\n\nopportunities for the disabled:\n\n     These new subsections would also apply to state or local\n     land use and health and safety laws, regulations, practices\n     or decisions which discriminate against individuals with\n     handicaps. While state and local governments have authority\n     to protect safety and health, and to regulate use of land,\n     that authority has sometimes been used to restrict the\n     ability of individuals with handicaps to live in\n     communities. This has been accomplished by such means as\n     the enactment or imposition of health, safety or land-use\n     requirements on congregate living arrangements among non-\n     related persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n        See Fair Housing Act of 1968, Pub.

See Pub. L. No. 93-\n383, 88 Stat. 83 (1974).\n\n                                  17\n\fH.R. REP. NO. 100-711, at 24, reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2173,\n\n2185 (emphasis added).13\n\n     The “reasonable accommodations” language, now codified in 42\n\nU.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B), specifically targeted the type of zoning\n\nregulations at issue here.   Congress found that these seemingly\n\n“neutral rules and regulations,” even those involving commercial/\n\nnoncommercial zoning distinctions, nonetheless had a\n\ndiscriminatory effect on the housing choices available for the\n\ndisabled.   See id. (“The Committee intends that the prohibition\n\nagainst discrimination against those with handicaps apply to\n\nzoning decisions and practices.”).   Primarily, the discriminatory\n\neffect recognized by Congress resulted from the fact that the\n\ndisabled were not able to live safely and independently without\n\norganized, and sometimes commercial, group homes like the one at\n\nissue.14\n\n     13\n        Section 3604 also governs organizations like Groome\nResources that provide services to the disabled. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(a)-(f).\n     14\n        In Cleburne, which informed the passage of the FHAA, the\nSupreme Court adopted this circuit’s findings that “without group\nhomes . . . the retarded could never hope to integrate themselves\ninto the community.” 473 U.S. at 438 (citing Cleburne Living\nCtr., Inc., v. City of Cleburne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430654\"><a href=\"/opinion/430654/cleburne-living-center-inc-v-city-of-cleburne-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (5th Cir.\n1984)). The Fifth Circuit’s findings, in turn, were informed by\nthe district court’s findings, which go directly to the issue\nhere regarding the importance of commercially run homes for\nhandicapped individuals,\n\n     “Group homes currently are the principal community living\n     alternatives for persons who are mentally retarded. The\n     availability of such a home in communities is an essential\n     ingredient of normal living patterns for persons who are\n\n                                18\n\f     In the scheme of the FHAA, the reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision exists as a prohibition on discrimination against the\n\ndisabled in the purchase, sale, or rental of housing.   As set out\n\nin § 3604(f)(3)(B), the failure to reasonably accommodate the\n\ndisabled in the context of housing is, itself, a defined act of\n\ndiscrimination.   The question before this court is whether the\n\nactivity of regulating discrimination against the disabled in the\n\npurchase, sale, or rental of housing can be shown to\n\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce, and therefore be upheld\n\nas a legitimate exercise of congressional authority.\n\n\n\n      B. Congressional Authority Under the Commerce Clause\n\n     The Commerce Clause grants Congress the constitutional\n\nauthority “‘to regulate Commerce . . . among the several states,’\n\nand [] concomitant power to protect the nation’s commerce by\n\nenacting such laws as it deems ‘necessary and proper.’”   United\n\n\n\n\n     mentally retarded, and each factor that makes such group\n     homes harder to establish operates to exclude persons who\n     are mentally retarded from the community.”\n\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 439 n. 6 (quoting Cleburne, 726 F.2d at\n193). Other circuits have recognized that commercial group homes\nmay be the only way for disabled individuals to live in a\nresidential community: “As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit has observed, ‘the handicapped may have little choice but\nto live in a commercial home if they desire to live in a\nresidential neighborhood.” Hovsons, Inc. v.

See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 552, 556.   As Judge\n\nHigginbotham recognized in United States v. Kirk,\n\n     On the one hand, courts have a constitutional duty to\n     scrutinize congressional actions to ensure that Congress\n     stays within its constitutionally enumerated powers; if\n     Lopez means anything, it is that Congress’s power under the\n     Commerce Clause must have some limits. On the other hand,\n     we must discipline our scrutiny to ensure that we are about\n     the business of judicial review and not the business of\n     social policy.

See 514 U.S. at\n552.\n     16\n        Morrison invalidated the federal civil remedy provision\nof the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 13981(b).\nThe Supreme Court found that Congress lacked the constitutional\nauthority to enact the section’s civil remedy, finding neither\nCommerce Clause authority nor authority under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment.

Commerce Clause After Morrison: Refinement of Lopez’s Third\n\n         Category of Permissible Congressional Regulation\n\n     In Morrison, the Supreme Court clarified this circuit’s\n\ninterpretation of Lopez and provided further analytical guidance\n\nas to the third category of activity — “substantially affecting\n\ninterstate commerce.”   The Morrison Court looked to four\n\nadditional factors to determine whether the congressional act at\n\nissue exceeded the scope of its constitutional authority.\n\n     First, the Court considered the “economic nature of the\n\nregulated activity.”    See Morrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750 (“‘Where\n\neconomic activity substantially affects interstate commerce,\n\nlegislation regulating that activity will be sustained.’”)\n\n(quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 560).     The Court emphasized the\n\neconomic or commercial character of previous Commerce Clause\n\ncases.   See id. (collecting cases).    The Court found that in both\n\nLopez and Morrison, neither the “actors” nor the “conduct” of the\n\nregulation had a commercial character, and neither the “purpose”\n\n\n\n                                 24\n\fnor the “design” of the statute had an evident commercial nexus.\n\nSee id.\n\n     Second, the Morrison court determined that the lack of an\n\nexpress jurisdictional element in the Lopez statute weakened the\n\nclaim that Congress was acting within its Commerce Clause powers.\n\nSee id. at 1750-51 (“Such a jurisdictional element may establish\n\nthat the enactment is in pursuance of Congress’ regulation of\n\ninterstate commerce.”).\n\n     Third, the Court found that while Congress was not required\n\nto make formal findings, “the existence of such findings may\n\n‘enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity\n\nin question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even\n\nthough no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked\n\neye.’”    Id. at 1751 (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 553).\n\n     Finally, the Court cautioned against accepting an\n\n“attenuated” connection between the regulation and the interstate\n\nactivity.    See id.   Concerned that causal, “but-for” arguments\n\ncould lead to an evisceration of any limitations on federal\n\npower, the Court held Congress to a more direct link.\n\n     With these interpretive principles in mind, we now turn to\n\nanalyze the Parish’s challenge to the reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision of the FHAA.    Our task is to determine whether Congress\n\nhad a rational basis, as defined by Lopez-Morrison, to enact\n\n§ 3604(f)(3)(B).\n\n\n\n                                 25\n\f  C. The FHAA Substantially Affects Interstate Commerce and Is\n\n         Constitutional Under a Lopez-Morrison Analysis\n\n     The Parish argues that none of the Lopez categories would\n\nprovide Congress the authority to enact the FHAA.   We agree that\n\nthe first and second Lopez categories, involving the use of the\n\nchannels of interstate commerce, and instrumentalities of\n\ninterstate commerce are inapplicable here.   It is the third Lopez\n\ncategory, involving activities that substantially affect\n\ninterstate commerce, on which we base our rejection of the\n\nParish’s Commerce Clause argument.   To reach our conclusion, we\n\nanalyze each of the four additional Morrison factors in turn.\n\n\n\n  1. The Reasonable Accommodations Provision Regulates Economic\n\n   Activity Involving the Purchase, Sale, or Rental of Housing\n\n      Under Lopez-Morrison, to figure out whether an activity\n\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce, the first question we\n\nmust ask is whether the regulated activity is an activity\n\neconomic in nature.   See 120 S. Ct. at 1750 (“[The Court’s]\n\nreview of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those\n\ncases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate\n\nactivity based upon the activity’s substantial effects on\n\ninterstate commerce, the activity in question has been some sort\n\nof economic endeavor.”).   This query derives from the general\n\nLopez requirement that the regulated intrastate activities,\n\n“arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,\n\n                                26\n\fwhich viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate\n\ncommerce.”   Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561.\n\n     More specifically, the first Morrison question regarding\n\n“economic” activity, is answered by a close reading of Lopez,\n\nwhich provides two recognized and historically rooted means of\n\ncongressional regulation under the commerce power: (1) whether\n\nthe activity is “any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly\n\none might define those terms”; or (2) whether the activity exists\n\nas “an essential part of a larger regulation of economic\n\nactivity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless\n\nthe intrastate activity were regulated.”   Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561.\n\nUsing these two questions as our analytical framework, we\n\ndetermine under Lopez-Morrison, that Congress acted within its\n\nconstitutional power to enact the FHAA reasonable accommodations\n\nprovision.\n\n\n\n  a. The Purchase, Sale, or Rental of Residential Housing Is an\n\n                   Economic/Commercial Activity\n\n     The Parish argues that the activity being regulated is\n\n“wholly non-economic” and presumably non-commercial.   We disagree\n\nfinding that § 3604(f)(3)(B) affected the commercial transaction\n\nof purchasing a home and the commercial rental of housing, and,\n\ntherefore, fits well within the broad definition of economic\n\nactivity established by the Supreme Court and other circuits.\n\n\n\n                                27\n\f     The activity being regulated is one that directly affects\n\nthe commercial residential and rental housing market.         “In every\n\ncase where we have sustained federal regulation under Wickard’s\n\naggregation principle, the regulated activity was of an apparent\n\ncommercial character.”     Morrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750 n.4.       A\n\ndenial of reasonable accommodations affects a disabled\n\nindividual’s ability to buy, sell, or rent housing.         It is an act\n\nof discrimination that directly interferes with a commercial\n\ntransaction, and is an act that can be regulated to facilitate\n\neconomic activity.    The Parish’s decision to deny Groome\n\nResources a reasonable accommodation, therefore, is directly tied\n\nto the economic activity of buying a home, and the commercial\n\nactivity of operating an Alzheimer’s care facility.\n\n     As all American homeowners can attest, it is a transparently\n\ncommercial action to buy, sell, or rent a house.        Not only is it\n\nquite literally a “commercial transaction,” but viewed in the\n\naggregate, it implicates an entire commercial industry.18         A\n\npurchase of a house is “commercial intercourse,” Gibbons v.\n\n     18\n          The residential housing market in the United States is\nof tremendous economic significance to the national economy. In\n1997, the United States Census reported that the single-family\nhousing construction industry was valued at over $146 billion and\nemployed over 570,000 people.

Groome\n\nResources, a New Orleans-based limited liability partnership,\n\ncontracted to purchase a house from Cendant Mobility Services\n\nCorporation, a national relocating company.      This interstate\n\npurchase was financed by an interstate lender, Whitney National\n\nBank.     Most importantly, this interstate commercial transaction\n\nwas impeded by an act of housing discrimination — namely the\n\nParish’s failure to reasonably accommodate disabled individuals\n\nwishing to live in a group home.       Therefore, as a factual matter,\n\nGroome Resources’ proposed purchase of rental property to be used\n\nas a group home satisfies the requirement that we are confronting\n\na commercial and economic activity.\n\n     The commercial nature of this activity is further\n\nstrengthened by the fact that Groome Resources exists as a for-\n\n     19\n        Moreover, most housing purchases involve realtors,\nbrokers, title insurance, title registration and legal fees, and\nmay involve federally backed mortgages and the secondary mortgage\nmarket. In addition to supporting the commercial nature of a\nhousing purchase, many of the above factors also involve actors\nwith interstate ties. See McLain v. Real Estate Bd.

He challenged his conviction stating that the building\n\nwas not commercial or business property and, thus, not an\n\nactivity affecting interstate commerce.    The Court found that\n\n“[t]he rental of real estate is unquestionably” an “activity that\n\naffects commerce.”   Russell, 471 U.S. at 862.   The Court found\n\n\n     20\n        In addition to the commercial aspect of purchasing the\nhome, it must be noted that the granting of reasonable\naccommodations to Alzheimer’s group homes and other homes for\ndisabled individuals also affects the commercial viability of\ncare organizations like Groome Resources. The district court\nfound that the zoning ordinance, with its limitation on four\nunrelated persons, “will make it economically unfeasible for\nplaintiff to operate the proposed home.” The court recognized\nthat the economic viability of this care facility was impeded by\nthe refusal to grant an accommodation.\n     21\n        In both cases, the Court was confronted with the\nstatutory reach of the federal arson statute, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i),\nwhich prohibits the damage or destruction “by means of fire or an\nexplosive, any . . . property used in interstate or foreign\ncommerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign\ncommerce.” 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) (2000).\n\n                                30\n\fdispositive the existing “commercial market” in rental property\n\nas the justification for congressional power to criminalize\n\nostensibly local arson:\n\n        [We] recognize that the local rental of an apartment unit is\n        merely an element of a much broader commercial market in\n        rental properties. The congressional power to regulate the\n        class of activities that constitute the rental market for\n        real estate includes the power to regulate individual\n        activity within that class.\n\nId.22        This recognition was reaffirmed in the recent Jones\n\ndecision.\n\n        In Jones, the Court reversed and remanded a conviction based\n\non § 844(i) involving the fire-bombing of a private residence.\n\nThe Court held that “an owner-occupied residence not used for any\n\ncommercial purpose does not qualify as property ‘used in’\n\ncommerce or commerce-affecting activity.”        Jones, 120 S. Ct. at\n\n1908.        The Jones Court distinguished Russell, finding that the\n\ndispositive fact in that case was that “[p]etitioner was renting\n\nhis apartment building to tenants at the time he attempted to\n\ndestroy it by fire.”        Id. at 1909 (quoting Russell, 471 U.S. at\n\n862)23; see also United States v. Corona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737414\"><a href=\"/opinion/737414/united-states-v-joseph-corona-iii-lindsey-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570-71\n\n        22\n        The Court relied on the arson statute’s legislative\nhistory to find that the purpose of the statute, “suggests that\nCongress at least intended to protect all business property, as\nwell as some additional property that might not fit that\ndescription, but perhaps not every private home.” Russell, 471\nU.S. at 862.\n        23\n        The Jones Court also posited a functionality test to\ndetermine whether arson of a building is a commerce-affecting\nact. The Court held that “[t]he proper inquiry . . . is into the\nfunction of the building itself, and then a determination of\n\n                                      31\n\f(5th Cir. 1997) (upholding § 844(i) conviction and stating, “[w]e\n\nfind that these convictions comport with the Commerce Clause\n\nbecause of the fact that the fire spread to the United Cab\n\nwarehouse. . . . Not only was the . . . property actually being\n\nrented, but it was serving a commercial rather than a residential\n\npurpose.”).\n\n     In each of these cases, congressional authority for\n\nregulation rested on the rental or commercial use of the\n\nproperty.   As the Groome Resources group home was both a rental\n\nproperty charging monthly rent to its clients and a commercial\n\noperation, we find that the home’s commercial use\n\n“unquestionably” is an “activity that affects commerce.”24   The\n\nfailure to grant a reasonable accommodation to the home is an act\n\n\nwhether that function affects interstate commerce.” Jones, 120\nS. Ct. at 1910. In the instant case, the house is functioning as\na rental unit for disabled individuals, which under Russell can\nbe regulated under the commerce power.\n     24\n          We are mindful of Justice Souter’s dissenting\nadmonition that the Morrison majority had created an unworkable\n“formalistic economic/noneconomic distinction.” 120 S. Ct. at\n1768 (Souter, J., dissenting). While we need not resolve this\nproblem in a factual situation that presents no such issue, the\nlogic of the Jones/Morrison court could suggest that Congress has\nthe constitutional authority to regulate discrimination against\nthe disabled in housing that is rented or otherwise used for\ncommercial purposes, but not regulate the sale or purchase of a\nhome to be used for private uses by the disabled. Of course, the\nregulated activity of arson in Jones is readily distinguishable\nfrom the purchase or sale of a house. In future cases, however,\ncourts may be called upon to resolve the issue of whether housing\ndiscrimination involving purely private actors for private, non-\ncommercial use, substantially affects interstate commerce more\nthan arson and, thus, confront the categorical logic of Jones/\nMorrison.\n\n                                32\n\fof discrimination against the disabled that frustrated an\n\ninterstate commercial transaction, and affected a commercial\n\nendeavor.   Therefore, while not dispositive, these cases support\n\nthe conclusion that we are dealing with a commercial activity\n\nthat falls within the purview of Congress’s regulatory\n\nauthority.25\n\n     We are further supported in our determination that\n\ndiscrimination infringing on the rental, purchase, and sale of\n\nreal estate is activity “economic in nature,” by the broad\n\nreading given to “economic activity” by other courts.    Most\n\nrecently, the Morrison Court provided an expansive reading of\n\neconomic activity that affected interstate commerce, including as\n\nit did Wickard’s regulation of homegrown and home-consumed wheat.\n\nSee 120 S. Ct. at 1750; see also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 574\n\n(recognizing our evolution from “an understanding of commerce\n\n\n     25\n           The Supreme Court has also permitted congressional\nregulation of the interstate sale of real property through the\nSherman Act.

See 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of the\n\nUnited States to provide within constitutional limitations, for\n\nfair housing throughout the United States.”(emphasis added)).\n\n                                38\n\fCongress acted in response to the recognition that in a mobile\n\nsociety in which people and families move within states and\n\nlocalities, and where local land use laws affect the movement of\n\npeople, there is a national effect on housing materials, economic\n\ndevelopment, and growth of certain restricted areas.29    The\n\nreasonable accommodations provision is but one means by which to\n\nprevent housing discrimination against disabled individuals, and\n\nthus, one means to counteract the economic effect of housing\n\ndiscrimination at the national level.\n\n     “Where the class of activities is regulated and that class\n\nis within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to\n\nexcise, as trivial, individual instances of the class.”    Perez v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108326\"><a href=\"/opinion/108326/perez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (1971).    Therefore, the Parish’s\n\nchallenge to the reasonable accommodations provision must be\n\nevaluated in the context of the entire statute.    See Lopez, 514\n\nU.S. at 558 (“Where a general regulatory statute bears a\n\nsubstantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of\n\nindividual instances arising under that statute is of no\n\nconsequence.” (quoting Maryland v.

Undertaking that analysis, we are satisfied that since\n\n§ 3604 affects the interstate market for housing, we must uphold\n\nthe individual provisions of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n     29\n           See infra notes 34 & 35.\n\n                                  39\n\f     In similar fashion, the national regulation of fair housing\n\nalso undermines the Parish’s “local land use” argument.    Local\n\nefforts to exclude the disabled from the community by refusing to\n\nprovide reasonable accommodations to zoning laws, may be\n\nregulated on a federal level if that local refusal affects the\n\nnational economy.   See Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 258\n\n(“[I]f it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does\n\nnot matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze.”\n\n(citations omitted)).   Thus, that the act of discrimination takes\n\nplace on a local stage is of no moment, because when Congress has\n\nchosen a national arena to regulate, every actor that affects\n\ncommerce is subject to regulation.\n\n     Because the Parish’s decision to deny Groome Resources a\n\nreasonable accommodation is inextricably tied to the economic\n\nactivity of buying a home and the commercial activity of\n\noperating a rental-based Alzheimer’s care facility, and the\n\nculmination of many such activities could rationally be\n\ndetermined to have a substantial effect on the national housing\n\nmarket, we find that under the Lopez-Morrison rational basis\n\ntest, Congress acted within its Commerce Clause authority.\n\n     Therefore, under both of the recognized means of regulation\n\nanalyzed in Lopez, we find Morrison’s first question — of whether\n\nthe activity is economic or commercial in nature — to be\n\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\n                                40\n\f           2. There Is No Express Jurisdictional Element\n\n      As the FHAA has no express jurisdictional element, we need\n\nnot belabor this second prong of the Morrison analysis.      See\n\nMorrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1750-51 (finding that a jurisdictional\n\nelement could assist constitutional interpretation by providing\n\n“an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce”);\n\nsee also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561-62 (requiring a jurisdictional\n\nelement to facilitate a “case-by-case inquiry” into the\n\ninterstate “nexus”).\n\n      We do note, however, that the requirement of a\n\njurisdictional element in both Morrison and Lopez is relevant\n\nonly because there was no obvious interstate economic connection\n\nin those cases, involving as they did, non-economic and\n\nintrastate activities.   While we do not rest our holding on this\n\nfactor, the explicit economic nature of commercial housing used\n\nfor rental purposes and the economic effect of discrimination on\n\nthe national housing market (as detailed above) presents a very\n\ndifferent situation than cases challenging non-economic and non-\n\ncommercial regulatory acts.\n\n\n\n 3.   The Legislative History of the FHAA Supports the Interstate\n\n         Nature of the Reasonable Accommodations Provision\n\n      The third prong of Morrison asks whether the legislative\n\nhistory of the Act provides insight into the “legislative\n\njudgment that the activity in question substantially affects\n\n                                41\n\finterstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect is\n\nvisible to the naked eye.”   120 S. Ct. at 1751.   As is evidenced\n\nby the interstate, economic nature of housing discrimination\n\ndiscussed previously, we are not dealing with an invisible\n\neffect.\n\n     Nevertheless, following the dictates of Morrison, we find\n\nthe legislative action that resulted in the passage of the FHAA\n\nto have recognized a pattern of discrimination that affected the\n\ninterstate housing market and the creation of commercial group\n\nhomes for handicapped individuals.   The passage of the FHAA in\n\n1988 was the culmination of eight years of congressional\n\ndiscussion on the topic of discrimination against the disabled.30\n\nHearings on the subject were held in 1979,31 1986,32 and 1988.33\n\n\n     30\n        See H.R.

And my question\n     would be to one of the learned Senators on the floor: What\n     clause in the Constitution gives the Federal Government the\n     right to go in and set the size of bathrooms and building\n     codes?    Is this in the 13th amendment or is it from the\n     commerce clause in the Constitution? Where does this come\n     from?   Is this even constitutional?     That is my question.\n     *   *   *    *   *\n     Mr. Specter. Mr. President, I would be delighted to respond\n     to the question.    The commerce clause.\n     Mr. Symms. The Senator says the commerce clause.     Does the\n     size of bathrooms in multiunit housing affect the commerce\n     clause?\n     Mr. Specter. Yes.\n     Mr. Symms. How?\n     Mr. Specter. Because the Commerce Clause touches the\n     construction of housing where the materials passed in\n     interstate commerce.    Where there is a determination by the\n     Congress of the United States that interstate commerce is\n     affected, the decisions by the Supreme Court of the United\n     States are clear that it may reach issues like housing\n     comprehended by this Fair Housing Act.\n\n 134 CONG. REC. S10541 (1988).\n     38\n        Particularly, we note that the legislative record\ndemonstrates a concern about group homes being discriminated\nagainst through zoning mechanisms: “[The FHAA] is intended to\nprohibit special restrictive covenants or other terms or\n\n                                  46\n\fheard testimony about the lack of adequate housing for disabled\n\nindividuals,39 the overt discrimination against college\n\nstudents,40 paralyzed veterans returning home from war,41 disabled\n\nmilitary spouses required to move interstate after their husbands\n\nwere transferred,42 and other instances of discrimination that\n\nplaced burdens on the interstate movement of persons and\n\n\n\nconditions . . . which have the effect of excluding, for example,\ncongregate living arrangements for persons with handicaps.” H.R.\nREP.

See McClung, 379 U.S. at 299.\n\n     This testimony, supported by legal briefs discussing\n\nCongress’s constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause, is\n\nsufficient to demonstrate that Congress was acting with\n\nconsidered legislative judgment.      Under a Lopez-Morrison\n\nanalysis, the legislative record suffices to demonstrate that\n\nCongress had a rational basis to prohibit housing discrimination\n\nbecause of its effect on interstate commerce.     We recognize\n\n“whether particular operations affect interstate commerce\n\nsufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress\n\nto regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a\n\nlegislative question.”    Morrison, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1752</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quoting Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. at 557).   However, on the facts presented, we are\n\nsatisfied that Congress acted within its constitutional authority\n\nin enacting the FHAA.\n\n\n\n4. The Connection Between the Reasonable Accommodations Provision\n\n           and Interstate Commerce Is Not Too Attenuated\n\n     The final factor for analysis under Morrison is an\n\nattenuation analysis.    In Lopez, the Supreme Court rejected the\n\ngovernment’s attempt to argue that because the possession of guns\n\n\n     43\n          See supra note 34.\n\n                                 48\n\fmay lead to violent crime, and that crime can affect the national\n\neconomy by increasing costs through insurance and decreasing\n\n“national productivity,” there is a connection between possession\n\nof guns and interstate commerce.      Similarly, in Morrison, the\n\nCourt reaffirmed that there must be a more direct connection\n\nbetween the regulation of violence against women and interstate\n\ncommerce.    See Morrison, 120 S. Ct. at 1751 (“[In Lopez] [w]e\n\nrejected these ‘costs of crime’ and ‘national productivity’\n\narguments because they would permit Congress to ‘regulate not\n\nonly all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to\n\nviolent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to\n\ninterstate commerce.”).\n\n     The attenuation argument in the instant case need not detain\n\nus long.    Unlike the need for several logical links to connect\n\nthe regulated activity with commerce as in Lopez and Morrison,\n\nhere the link is direct.    We do not need to pile “inference upon\n\ninference” to see that by refusing to reasonably accommodate the\n\ndisabled by discriminatory zoning laws, there will be less\n\nopportunity for handicapped individuals to buy, sell, or rent\n\nhomes.   The attendant financial loss to the economy from Groome\n\nResources’ failed attempt to purchase such a house in Louisiana\n\nis a case in point.\n\n     The testimony presented to Congress well demonstrated that\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled impeded housing rentals,\n\npurchases, and interstate travel.     Therefore, the regulation of\n\n                                 49\n\fdiscriminatory policies in the purchase or rental of housing\n\ndirectly affects the housing industry and the economy.     Further,\n\nwe are bound by the logic of Heart of Atlanta and McClung, where\n\nsuch a link between discrimination and commerce was ratified by\n\nthe Supreme Court.    See McClung, 379 U.S. at 299-301 (discussing\n\nHeart of Atlanta Motel).\n\n\n\n                 5. Conclusion on the Commerce Clause\n\n     There is, however, a deeper concern embedded in the\n\nattenuation analysis that implicates a structural issue of\n\nfederalism.   The Morrison/Lopez courts were concerned about\n\nunbounded federal power, and a concomitant federal invasion into\n\nareas of traditional state authority.\n\n     We are therefore cognizant and respectful of Morrison’s\n\nconcern with the “distinction between what is truly national and\n\nwhat is truly local.”    120 S. Ct. at 1754.   We are persuaded,\n\nhowever, that housing discrimination against the disabled is a\n\nnational concern that substantially affects the economic health\n\nof the nation.    While states and localities retain broad powers\n\nto regulate and zone land within their jurisdictions, see Village\n\nof Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100934\"><a href=\"/opinion/100934/village-of-euclid-v-ambler-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393 (1926), this\n\nlocal land use authority cannot defeat congressional action\n\npredicated on a nexus between discrimination and commerce.\n\n     The discriminatory application of local land use authority\n\nimplicates the central concern of federalism as articulated by\n\n                                  50\n\fLopez and Morrison — namely that federalizing certain spheres of\n\nauthority blurs the federal/state distinction, undermining\n\npolitical accountability and impeding local experimentation:\n\n     Federalism serves to assign political responsibility, not to\n     obscure it. . . . Were the Federal Government to take over\n     the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern,\n     areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercial\n     activities, the boundaries between the spheres of federal\n     and state authority would blur and political responsibility\n     would become illusory.\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 577 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citations\n\nomitted); see also id. at 581 (“If a State or municipality\n\ndetermines that harsh criminal sanctions are necessary and wise\n\nto deter students from carrying guns on school premises, the\n\nreserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those\n\nmeasures.”); id. at 583 (“The statute now before us forecloses\n\nthe States from experimenting and exercising their own judgment\n\nin an area to which States lay claim by right of history and\n\nexpertise.”).\n\n     “Our Federalism,” however, is not threatened here.     While\n\nthe incantation of “local zoning” and “traditional” authority is\n\npresent in this case, in substance, the issue before this court\n\npresents no federalism difficulty.    Unlike Lopez or Morrison, it\n\ndoes not serve the balance of federalism to allow local\n\ncommunities to discriminate against the disabled.   Local\n\nauthorities cannot “experiment” by creating communities that\n\nexclude the disabled any more than local authorities can\n\nexperiment by excluding minorities.   Further, the FHAA was passed\n\n                               51\n\fprecisely because the political voice of the disabled was\n\nsilenced in local debates as they were not allowed to move into\n\nthe neighborhood in the first instance.44   The values of\n\npolitical accountability and experimentation, in fact, may be\n\nstrengthened by the reasonable accommodations provision allowing\n\nthe disabled an equal opportunity to live and participate in our\n\ncommunities, and thus change society through the local democratic\n\nprocess.\n\n     To be clear, nothing in this analysis supports the argument\n\nthat the federal government can regulate the intricacies of local\n\nzoning decisions.   In fact, the vast majority of local zoning\n\ndecisions support the rationale of federalism, providing\n\npolitical accountability and flexibility through local control.\n\nNeither the reasonable accommodations provision nor the FHAA\n\npurports to change this balance of power.45   See Bryant Woods Inn\n\nInc. v.
