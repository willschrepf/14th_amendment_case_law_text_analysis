Following an\nadverse administrative decision by the Montana Commis-\nsioner of Political Practices, the Church brought this action in\nfederal court, claiming that the Commissioner’s decision vio-\nlated its First Amendment and due process rights and seeking\ndeclaratory relief as well as nominal damages. On cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court upheld the\nMontana law against all challenges. We reverse.\n\n                      BACKGROUND\n\n  Canyon Ferry Road Baptist Church, an incorporated reli-\ngious institution located in East Helena, Montana, generally\nadheres to the Christian doctrines of the Southern Baptist\nConvention. Among these doctrines is the belief that marriage\nmay exist only between one man and one woman.\n\n  In the spring of 2004, the Church’s Pastor, Berthold\nGotlieb Stumberg, III, became interested in possible ways in\n\f2172            CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nwhich the Church could assist in an effort to collect signatures\nto place Constitutional Initiative No. 96 (“CI-96”) on the\nMontana state ballot the following November. If placed on the\nballot and approved by Montana’s voters, CI-96 would amend\nthe Montana state constitution to define marriage as a union\nbetween one man and one woman. For the signatures to be\neffective, the signed petition forms had to be turned over to\nthe sponsoring organization and then submitted to appropriate\nelection officials no later than June 18, 2004.\n\n   In May 2004, Terri Paske, a member of the Church who\ncampaigned for CI-96 in partnership with Jeff Laszloffy,1\nprinted out a template CI-96 petition from the Montana Fam-\nily Foundation website and made less than fifty copies of the\npetition on the Church’s copy machine, using her own paper.\nWith Stumberg’s approval, Paske placed roughly twenty cop-\nies of the petition in the Church’s foyer.\n\n   At about the same time, Stumberg began making arrange-\nments for the Church’s congregation to view an audio-visual\nsimulcast entitled Battle for Marriage. The Battle for Mar-\nriage simulcast included presentations by several prominent\nreligious leaders on the topic of marriage. Stumberg planned\nto have it screened in connection with a regularly scheduled\nSunday evening service on May 23, 2004. There is no evi-\ndence in the record that the Church was charged any fees for\naccess to the Battle for Marriage simulcast.\n\n   The Church advertised the upcoming screening, which was\nopen to the public, through unpaid public service announce-\nments aired by five radio stations. Although the Church often\nincorporates simulcasts in its services and all of the Church’s\nservices are open to the public, the Battle for Marriage was\nthe only simulcast for which the Church secured public ser-\nvice announcements on the radio. In addition, the Church\n  1\n   Laszloffy was a sponsor of CI-96 and the president of its campaign\ncommittee, Montana Family Foundation.\n\f                 CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                     2173\nphotocopied and circulated flyers publicizing the event, the\ntemplate for which had been provided to the Church by the\norganizers of the simulcast. The flyers were placed in the\nChurch’s bulletin and Stumberg encouraged members of the\ncongregation to take the flyers to their workplace and “let\npeople see it.” The flyers did not mention CI-96.\n\n   On May 23, 2004, ninety-three people attended the Battle\nfor Marriage event, well above the average attendance for a\ntypical Sunday evening service at the Church. The congrega-\ntion and members of the public watched the Battle for Mar-\nriage simulcast. In addition to televised presentations by\nseveral Christian ministers, the simulcast discussed a pro-\nposed amendment to the United States Constitution that\nwould establish a definition of marriage as being solely\nbetween one man and one woman. It did not expressly sup-\nport or oppose any Montana ballot issue or candidate for pub-\nlic office.\n\n   After the Battle for Marriage program ended, Stumberg\nspoke to those in attendance about CI-96. He said that the\nthreat to marriage also existed in Montana, and that the con-\ngregation should resist it in prayer and by signing the CI-96\npetition. Stumberg told the audience that they “need[ed] to\nsign” the CI-96 petition and that he would “encourage[ ]\neveryone to sign it. This is one of the ways that we take a\nstand for righteousness.” He then indicated that CI-96 peti-\ntions were available in the foyer near the Church’s exits. The\nfollowing Sunday, Stumberg circulated the CI-96 petition for\nsignature among the attendees at each of the Church’s three\nservices that day during announcement time. The petitions\nremained available in the Church’s foyer for signature until\nthey were submitted on June 13, 2004.\n\n  By June 13, 2004, the petitions made available in the\nChurch’s foyer contained ninety-eight valid signatures of resi-\ndents of Lewis and Clark County.2 Ninety-two of these came\n  2\n   Similar forms were also available in the foyer for signature by resi-\ndents of two other counties. The record does not disclose how many signa-\n\f2174              CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nfrom members of the Church. Paske had the forms notarized\nand mailed copies of the signed petitions to the designated\ncounty officials for filing and to Laszloffy. The sponsors of\nCI-96 ultimately obtained the requisite number of signatures\nand the initiative was placed on the November ballot. It was\npassed by the voters of Montana by a margin 295,070 Yes\nvotes to 148,263 No votes (66.5% to 33.5%).\n\n   On May 26, 2004, an advocacy group called “Montanans\nfor Families and Fairness” filed a Campaign Finance and\nPractices Complaint against the Church. The complaint\nalleged that the Church, by its “expenditures” in connection\nwith the May 23 event to support CI-96, had created an “inci-\ndental political committee” within the meaning of Montana’s\ncampaign finance laws but had not filed the required disclo-\nsure forms. After completing an investigation, the state Com-\nmission of Political Practices (“Commission”) issued an\nadministrative decision. It found that\n\n     it is clear that when the Church and pastor Stumberg\n     chose to engage in activities supporting the effort to\n     place CI-96 on the ballot, the Church became an\n     incidental political committee under Montana law,\n     with corresponding reporting obligations. Use of the\n     Church’s facilities to obtain signatures on CI-96\n     petitions, along with Pastor Stumberg’s encourage-\n     ment of persons to sign the CI-96 petitions during\n     regularly scheduled Church services, obviously had\n     value to the campaign in support of CI-96. Pastor\n     Stumberg was not acting as a volunteer when he\n     engaged in the activities supporting CI-96, since\n\ntures were collected from residents of those counties, but suggests that the\ngreat majority of the signatures came from residents of Lewis and Clark\nCounty.\n\f                  CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                          2175\n      those activities occurred in the Church building and\n      during regularly scheduled Church services.3\n\n   The Church and Stumberg (collectively, the “Church”)\nbrought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory\nrelief and nominal damages. The Church challenges the Com-\nmissioner’s application of Montana’s disclosure and reporting\nprovisions. It argues that, as interpreted by the Commission,\nMontana’s disclosure and reporting provisions are impermiss-\nibly vague, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. It also argues that the provisions are\noverbroad and violate the Church’s First Amendment rights of\nfree speech, association, and free exercise of religion. The\nparties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and the dis-\ntrict court dismissed the complaint, rejecting all the claims\nasserted by the Church. The Church appeals. We have juris-\ndiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                 STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n\n   Since the 1970s, Montana has required “political commit-\ntees” to disclose expenditures and contributions made toward\ncandidate elections and ballot issues and to comply with addi-\ntional reporting requirements. In relevant part, the key term\n“political committee” is defined as “a combination of two or\nmore individuals or a person other than an individual who\nmakes a contribution or expenditure . . . to support or oppose\na ballot issue or a committee organized to support or oppose\na ballot issue . . . .” Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-1-101(20).4 Mon-\n  3\n     Unpaid services provided to candidates or political committees by indi-\nviduals volunteering their time are excluded from the statutory definitions\nof “contribution” and “expenditure.” Mont. Code Ann. § 13-1-101(7)(b)(i)\nand (11)(b)(i).\n   4\n     Individuals have no duty to report directly to the State the contributions\nand expenditures they make in connection with candidate elections or bal-\nlot initiatives. Their contributions to political committees or individual\ncandidates, however, are reported by the recipients as part of their report-\ning and disclosure obligations. Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-37-229(4). If an\nindividual’s aggregate contributions to a given candidate or committee are\ngreater than $35, the recipient must report the contributor’s full name,\nmailing address, occupation, and employer, if any. Id. § 13-37-229(2).\n\f2176                CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\ntana’s Administrative Rules refine this definition by differen-\ntiating among three different types of “political committees”:\n“principal campaign committees,” “independent committees,”\nand “incidental committees.” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.327(1).\nThe Commission found the Church to be an “incidental com-\nmittee,” which is defined as “a political committee that is not\nspecifically organized or maintained for the primary purpose\nof influencing elections but that may incidentally become a\npolitical committee by making a contribution or expenditure\nto support or oppose a candidate and/or issue.”5 Mont. Admin.\nR. 44.10.327(2)(c).\n\n   The designation of a group or entity as an “incidental com-\nmittee,” then, turns on the definition of the terms “contribu-\ntion” and “expenditure”; if two or more persons make a\ncontribution or expenditure for or against a candidate or ballot\nproposition, a committee has been formed. A “contribution”\nis defined as\n\n       an advance, gift, loan, conveyance, deposit, pay-\n       ment, or distribution of money or anything of value\n       to influence an election; a transfer of funds between\n       political committees [or] the payment by a person\n       other than a candidate or political committee of com-\n       pensation for the personal services of another person\n       that are rendered to a candidate or political commit-\n       tee.\n\nMont. Code. Ann. § 13-1-101 (7)(a)(i)-(ii).6 Similarly, an “ex-\npenditure” is defined as\n  5\n   “Issue” is defined by the statute as:\n      a proposal submitted to the people at an election for their\n      approval or rejection, including but not limited to initiatives, ref-\n      erenda, proposed constitutional amendments, recall questions,\n      school levy questions, bond issue questions, or a ballot question.\n§ 13-1-101(17).\n   6\n     The statute carves out from this definition of “contribution” the time\ndevoted by volunteers working on a campaign as well as any lodging and\n\f                  CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                        2177\n     a purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance,\n     promise, pledge, or gift of money or anything of\n     value made for the purpose of influencing the results\n     of an election.\n\n§ 13-1-101(11)(a). The term “anything of value”—which\naffects the scope of “expenditures” and “contributions” alike\n—is defined as “any goods that have a certain utility to the\nrecipient that is real and that is ordinarily not given away free\nbut is purchased.” § 13-1-101(3). Montana’s Administrative\nRules elaborate on the scope of these key provisions. The\nterms “expenditures” and “contributions” encompass “in-\nkind” expenditures and contributions, which refer—with\nsome exceptions irrelevant in this case—to “the furnishing of\nservices, property, or rights without charge or at a charge\nwhich is less than fair market value to a person, candidate, or\npolitical committee for the purpose of supporting or opposing\nany person, candidate, ballot issue or political committee\n. . . .” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.323(2).\n\n   Different types of “political committees” are subject to dif-\nferent reporting and disclosure obligations. As an “incidental\ncommittee,” the Church is required to report all transactions,\nregardless of the amount involved, that 1) qualify as “expen-\nditures” or “contributions” under the statute and regulations\nand 2) are made by the committee “in connection with a state-\nwide issue.” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.411(4). In addition, an\nincidental committee must also report every contribution that\nit receives if the contribution is “earmarked.”7 Mont. Admin.\nR. 44.10.411(5). Other donations, such as those that the\n\nmeals provided by individuals in their private residences, news or editorial\ncoverage in the media and an organization’s communications to its mem-\nbership. § 13-1-101 (7)(b).\n   7\n     A contribution is “earmarked” if it is “made with the direction, express\nor implied, that all or part of it be transferred to or expended on behalf of\na specified candidate, ballot issue, or petition for nomination.” Mont.\nAdmin. R. 44.10.519(1).\n\f2178             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nChurch ordinarily receives to support its regular operations,\nare not subject to any reporting or disclosure requirements.\n\n   Generally, an incidental committee is subject to periodic\nfilings which must be completed every quarter and at various\ntimes surrounding an election. Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-37-\n226(6); Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.411. If the incidental commit-\ntee makes a one-time political expenditure, however, it may\nfile a combined initial and closing report that terminates its sta-\ntus.8 In either case, the initial registration as an “incidental\ncommittee” must occur within five days of making a political\nexpenditure. § 13-37-201.\n\n   If a political committee fails to file a required report within\nthe required time periods, the Commissioner of Political Prac-\ntices may issue an order of noncompliance. § 13-37-121(2).\nUpon issuance of an order of noncompliance, a political com-\nmittee must submit the necessary information within five or\nten days, depending on whether the order is issued during an\nelection period or not, respectively. § 13-37-121(3)-(4). Fail-\nure to do so may result in the initiation of civil or criminal\nactions. Id. In the past ten years, the Commissioner has settled\nor dismissed all investigations it has commenced under these\nprovisions without filing a civil action, and the record dis-\ncloses no criminal prosecutions.\n\n                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment. Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.\n  8\n    Unlike incidental committees, principal and independent committees\nare required to provide more extensive disclosure, including information\non (1) loans, (2) interest, rebates, refunds and fundraisers, (3) political\naction committee contributions, (4) political party committee contribu-\ntions, (5) incidental committee contributions, (6) individual contributions\nabove $35, (7) petty cash expenditures, (8) independent expenditures and\n(9) other debts outstanding. (http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/content/pdf/\n5cfp/2008_Complete_C-6_form_1.pdf).\n\f                 CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                     2179\n2001) (en banc). “Viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, we must determine\nwhether there are any genuine issues of material fact and\nwhether the district court correctly applied the relevant sub-\nstantive law.” Id.\n\n                           DISCUSSION\n\n   The Church argues that it cannot constitutionally be sub-\njected to the disclosure and reporting requirements applicable\nto “incidental political committees” under Montana law on the\nsole basis of its activities of de minimis economic effect in\nconnection with the Battle for Marriage event and related\npetition—signing efforts in support of CI-96. It argues, inter\nalia, that, as applied to its activities, the Montana statute is\nimpermissibly vague. We agree in part with the Church’s\nvagueness claim and hold that, as applied to (1) the placement\nof the petition in its foyer and (2) Stumberg’s exhortation to\nsign the petition in support of CI-96 during a regularly sched-\nuled Sunday service, the Commission’s interpretation of “in-\nkind expenditures” is unconstitutionally vague.\n\n   We also agree that the designation of the Church as an “in-\ncidental committee” because of its one-time, in-kind “expen-\nditures” of de minimis economic effect violates the Church’s\nFirst Amendment free speech rights.9\n\n                             Vagueness\n\n   [1] The thrust of the Church’s vagueness challenge is that\nthe definition of in-kind expenditures and contributions10\n  9\n   Our disposition of the vagueness and free speech issues makes it\nunnecessary for us to address the Church’s additional challenges based on\nFirst Amendment rights of association and free exercise of religion.\n  10\n     Although the Commission expressly rejected the contention that the\nChurch’s activities amounted to “coordinated expenditures,” it is not\nentirely clear whether the Commission considered the Church’s activities\n\f2180              CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nunder Montana law “fails to provide people of ordinary intel-\nligence a reasonable opportunity to understand” whether their\nactivities require disclosure under the statute. Hill v. Colo-\nrado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000). Montana law defines an “in-\nkind expenditure” as “the furnishing of services, property, or\nrights without charge or at a charge which is less than fair\nmarket value to a person, candidate, or political committee for\nthe purpose of supporting or opposing any person, candidate,\nballot issue or political committee.” Mont. Admin. R.\n44.10.323(2)11; see also Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.321(2)(a)\n(providing a similar definition of in-kind contributions).\n\n   On their face, the Montana regulations are precise enough.\nThe hallmark of an “in-kind” participation in a campaign\nfinance effort is the provision of a good or service either\n“without charge” or with a charge below its fair market value.\nFor example, extended provision of vehicles or rental space\nwithout charge are common types of in-kind political expen-\nditures or donations that clearly fall within this definition. We\nhave no doubt, therefore, that the Montana regulation poses\nno vagueness problem in the “ ‘vast majority of its intended\napplications.’ ” Hill, 530 U.S. at 733 (quoting United States\nv. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 23 (1960)). We accordingly reject the\nChurch’s claim that the regulation is void for vagueness on its\nface. See id.\n\nin-kind expenditures or in-kind contributions. This distinction does not\naffect our analysis, however, because, in this case, we are concerned only\nwith disclosure, not substantive restrictions on campaign finance. To avoid\nrepetitions, we assume that the Commission considered the Church’s\nactivities in-kind expenditures.\n   We also note that the Commission does not appear to have relied on the\nregulation extending the reach of “expenditures” to “[e]xpenses incurred\nin support of or opposition to the drafting, printing, distribution and col-\nlection of signatures for any petition for nomination or a statewide ballot\nissue.” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.323(1)(c).\n   11\n      This definition is quite similar to the comparable definition of in-kind\ncontributions in federal regulations. See 11 C.F.R. § 100.52(d).\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                2181\n   [2] The application of the regulation to the Church’s activi-\nties in this case presents a different question, however. Unlike\nthe federal disclosure law, 2 U.S.C. §§ 431(4)(A),\n434(b)(3)(A), the Montana disclosure and reporting require-\nments are triggered by any in-kind expenditure or contribu-\ntion, no matter how negligible its value. See Mont. Admin. R.\n44.10.411(4). The absence of a minimum value threshold sub-\nstantially affects the analysis of the disclosure requirement’s\nvagueness. As the commercial value of a certain activity in\nsupport of a candidate or ballot issue approaches zero, it\nbecomes increasingly difficult for the party engaging in the\nactivity to know whether his or her activity could possibly be\nconsidered a “service.” This case presents a classic illustration\nof the problem.\n\n   The Church’s activities relied on by the Commission\nincluded (1) allowing Paske to photocopy a CI-96 petition\nform on the Church’s copy machine, with her own paper; (2)\nplacing the CI-96 petitions in the Church’s foyer; and (3)\nStumberg’s exhortation to sign the CI-96 petition during a\nregularly scheduled sermon on May 23, 2004. The Commis-\nsion apparently found that all three of these activities consti-\ntuted “in-kind expenditures.” We conclude that, as applied to\nthe second and third activities, the definition of “in-kind\nexpenditure” is impermissibly vague.\n\n   [3] In extending the reach of “in-kind expenditures” to\ncover Stumberg’s endorsement and the Church’s acquies-\ncence in making the petition available in its foyer, the Com-\nmission apparently concluded that these activities amounted\nto “services.” With respect to Stumberg’s exhortation, the the-\nory adopted by the Commission is that any otherwise qualify-\ning political activity, if performed within the scope of one’s\nemployment, amounts to a “service.” The same theory\nappears to have driven the Commission’s conclusion with\nrespect to the Church’s decision to let Paske “use its facili-\nties” to display the petition.\n\f2182             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\n   [4] When a group’s “services” are accompanied by either\na detriment to the provider of the service—say, an out-of-\npocket expense or the preclusion of other activities—or an\nascertainable market value, notice that a service has been pro-\nvided is inherent in the provision of the service itself. But\nwhen the activity in question brings no detriment to the puta-\ntive incidental committee and carries no market value, the\nnotice fails. In that case, a group engaging in a certain activity\nfor the purpose of supporting a candidate or ballot issue is left\nwith no objective guidance as to whether it has provided a\n“service”; the best it can do is rest on its members’ subjective\nintent12 and guess what effect their conduct will have on the\nintended beneficiary. Under the Commission’s interpretation\nof “in-kind expenditures,” an activity that might not appear to\nbe an expenditure becomes one if the activity turns out to\nhave been of value to the beneficiary, even though that value\nmay not become apparent until after the reporting date has\npassed. Such uncertainty does not “provide people of ordinary\nintelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand” whether\ntheir activities require disclosure under the statute. Hill, 530\nU.S. at 732. We therefore conclude that Montana’s in-kind\nexpenditures provision may not be applied to the Church’s\nconduct when that conduct neither causes an economic detri-\nment to the Church nor carries an ascertainable market value.\n\n   [5] The Church’s placement of the petition in its foyer and\nStumberg’s endorsement of CI-96 do not bear the objective\nindicia that we have just specified. There is no indication that\nthe Church suffered any detriment from either placing a few\nsheets of paper in its foyer or having its pastor engage in a\nbrief discussion of CI-96. Nor do we accept the State’s char-\n  12\n    An expenditure or contribution requires an intent “to influence an\nelection.” Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-1-101(7)(a)(i). In addition, for two or\nmore people to be subjected to “incidental political committee” reporting\nrequirements, their contribution or expenditure must be made “to support\nor oppose a candidate and/or [ballot] issue.” Mont. Admin. R.\n44.10.327(2)(c).\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2183\nacterization of the entire Battle for Marriage event and May\n23, 2004 service as a rally in support of the signature-\ngathering effort. The event took place in conjunction with a\nregularly scheduled service, the discussion of CI-96 took up\nbut a fraction of the program, and the Church paid no fee to\nsecure access to the simulcast. Finally, the Church would\nhave incurred the same maintenance expenses whether Stum-\nberg had discussed and endorsed CI-96 or not. We therefore\nconclude that the Church incurred no expense or otherwise\ncognizable detriment in connection with these two activities.\n\n   Moreover, while we do not doubt that the sponsors of\nCI-96 eventually derived some value from the activities in\nquestion, nothing in the record establishes that either the dis-\nplay of the petition in the foyer of the Church or the endorse-\nment of the Church’s pastor, without more, carry any\nobjective market value. Certainly, the Church was not in the\nbusiness of selling endorsements or renting out its foyer to\nthose wishing to advertise therein; nor does the record dis-\nclose any market to which the sponsors of CI-96 could have\nturned to secure comparable assistance in exchange for a fee.\n\n   [6] We therefore conclude that, because the display of the\npetition in the Church’s foyer and Stumberg’s endorsement\ndid not bring about a detriment to the Church or carry ascer-\ntainable market value, the Church had no way to know ex ante\nthat, by engaging in these two activities, it was actually pro-\nviding a “service” that would later be considered an in-kind\nexpenditure in support of CI-96. As applied to these services,\nthe Montana regulations defining in-kind contributions are\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n   [7] In contrast, we conclude that, as applied to the Church’s\nacquiescence with Paske’s use of its copy machine to photo-\ncopy the template CI-96 petition, Montana’s definition of in-\nkind expenditure poses is not unconstitutionally vague. Unlike\nStumberg’s endorsement or the placement of the petition in\nthe Church’s foyer, the provision of a copy machine meets the\n\f2184             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nobjective criteria that we have set forth above. It is clear that\nthe Church incurred some, albeit de minimis, expense in the\nwear and tear of its equipment; it is also clear that Paske\nwould have been charged if she had secured the same photo-\ncopying services on the open market. It is not unreasonable to\ncharge the Church with knowledge that it was providing a ser-\nvice of some market value. Accordingly, we conclude that the\nregulations defining in-kind contribution are not impermiss-\nibly vague as applied to the copying service. That conclusion\ndoes not end our constitutional inquiry, however, for the\nChurch also challenges the regulations on First Amendment\nfree speech grounds.\n\n                      Free Speech Challenge\n\n   The Church challenges the financial and organizational dis-\nclosures that a group of two or more people must make upon\nbecoming an “incidental committee.” The Church argues that,\nas applied to its activities, the disclosure requirements\nimposed under Montana law violate its First Amendment\nrights by imposing an unjustified burden on its constitution-\nally protected election-related “speech.” We conclude that, as\napplied to the one-time in-kind de minimis expenditures\ninvolved in this case, the state reporting requirements violate\nthe Church’s First Amendment rights.\n\n  A.    Degree of Scrutiny\n\n   The degree of scrutiny that we must apply to Montana’s\ndisclosure requirements with respect to the Church’s activities\nis somewhat unclear, due in part to arguably inconsistent pre-\ncedent and in part to the uncertain status of the Church as a\nmulti-purpose advocacy organization.13 See Alaska Right To\n  13\n     The Church presents most, but not necessarily all of the salient fea-\ntures of a multipurpose public advocacy organization that was held to be\nentitled to challenge restrictions on campaign expenditures under a strict\nscrutiny standard in FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238\n\f                  CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                       2185\nLife Comm. v. Miles, 441 F.3d 773, 787-88 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(questioning whether, in the wake of McConnell v. FEC, 540\nU.S. 93 (2003), disclosure requirements should be subjected\nto strict scrutiny in an as-applied challenge brought by a\nmulti-purpose organization and assuming without deciding\nthat strict scrutiny applied). But see Cal. Pro-Life Council,\nInc. v. Randolph (“Cal. Pro-Life II”), 507 F.3d 1172, 1178\n(9th Cir. 2007) (applying strict scrutiny to a multi-purpose\norganization after McConnell, albeit relying in part on the\n“law of the case” doctrine). We do not need to decide this\ncomplex question to adjudicate this case, however. We will\nassume without deciding that “heightened”—not “strict”—\nscrutiny applies to the Church’s challenge.14 In other words,\nwe ask whether the Montana disclosure requirement has a\n“ ‘relevant correlation’ or ‘substantial relation,’ ” Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64 (1976) (footnote omitted), to an “impor-\ntant state interest,” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 195. Even under\nthis standard, the state disclosure requirement, as applied to\nthe Church’s de minimis in-kind expenditures, runs afoul of\nthe First Amendment.\n\n  B.     Informational Interest\n\n   The State articulates only one interest in defense of its dis-\nclosure scheme: providing its citizenry with information about\nthe constituencies supporting and opposing ballot issues. We\nare satisfied that this interest is “important.”\n\n(1986). Like Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the Church is a non-profit\norganization that cannot engage in business activities, has no shareholders\nor affiliated persons with a claim to assets or earnings and was not estab-\nlished by a corporation or business entity. See id. at 264. Unlike Massa-\nchusetts Citizens for Life, however, it was not “formed for the express\npurpose of promoting political ideas.” Id.\n   14\n      In Alaska Right to Life Comm., we similarly found it unnecessary to\nresolve the uncertainties over the standard of review, and applied the stan-\ndard most favorable to the non-prevailing party on appeal. Alaska Right\nto Life Comm., 441 F.3d at 788.\n\f2186             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\n   [8] In Buckley and again in McConnell, the Supreme Court\nidentified three “important” interests that justified campaign\nfinance disclosure in the context of elections for federal\noffice: “providing the electorate with information, deterring\nactual corruption and avoiding any appearance thereof, and\ngathering the data necessary to enforce more substantive elec-\ntioneering restrictions.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196 (citing\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 67-68). Of these, the second interest—\ndeterring corruption or the appearance thereof—falls out of\nthe picture in the context of ballot initiatives, for such refer-\nenda present no risk of quid pro quo. See, e.g., First Nat’l\nBank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 790 (1978) (“The\nrisk of corruption perceived in cases involving candidate elec-\ntions . . . is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.”);\nMont. Chamber of Commerce v. Argenbright, 226 F.3d 1049,\n1056 (9th Cir. 2000) (same). In addition, the state disclosure\nrequirements at issue in this case are evidently not substan-\ntially related to the third important interest: aid in enforcing\n“more substantive electioneering restrictions,” for no substan-\ntive limits on contributions or expenditures apply in the con-\ntext of Montana’s ballot issues. McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196\n(emphasis added); see Mont. Chamber of Commerce, 226\nF.3d at 1057-58 (striking down Montana’s ban on corporate\nexpenditures and contributions in ballot issues under Mont.\nCode Ann. § 13-35-227).\n\n   [9] With respect to the remaining interest, we have little\ntrouble concluding that Montana’s informational interest is\ngenerally “important” in the context of Montana’s statewide\nballot issues. Indeed, we recently observed that California had\nproduced evidence sufficient to qualify its informational inter-\nest in disclosure of contributions to a ballot issue as “compel-\nling.” Cal. Pro-Life II, 507 F.3d at 1179-80 nn.8&9. Although\nthe evidence put forth by Montana in this case is not as formi-\ndable as that provided by California in Cal. Pro-Life II,15\n   15\n      The evidence presented to the district court in Cal. Pro-Life II\nincluded a survey gauging public sentiment about the ballot initiative pro-\ncess, expert testimony by a professor of political science and an affidavit\nby a public official. 507 F.3d at 1179 n.8.\n\f                 CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                    2187\nMontana’s case is convincing and its burden lighter.16 See\nNixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov’t PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 391 (2000)\n(“The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy\nheightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary\nup or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justifica-\ntion raised.”). We have already held that, as a general matter,\nmandating disclosure of the financiers of a ballot initiative\nmay prevent “the wolf from masquerading in sheep’s cloth-\ning.” Cal. Pro-Life Council, Inc. v. Getman (“Cal. Pro-Life\nI”), 328 F.3d 1088, 1106 n.24 (9th Cir. 2003). “[B]y knowing\nwho backs or opposes a given initiative, voters will have a\npretty good idea of who stands to benefit from the legisla-\ntion.” Id. at 1106. We also reject the suggestion that, because\nMontana’s election system appears to be open and highly\nfunctional, the need for disclosure is somehow decreased. We\nare not willing to count Montanans’ current confidence in\ntheir state ballot process against the State’s informational\ninterest. See Mont. Chamber of Commerce, 28 F. Supp. 2d\n593, 598-99 (D. Mont. 1998), aff’d 226 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th\nCir. 2000) (“The ballot issue process in Montana is healthy\nand not corrupt.”). We conclude that, in the context of ballot\nissues in which this case arises, Montana’s interest in keeping\nits citizens well informed with respect to the groups finan-\ncially supporting and opposing voter initiatives remains “im-\nportant” today.\n\n   It is essential to keep in mind, however, just what informa-\ntion the State has determined that the public needs. The infor-\nmation to be disclosed is the identity of persons financially\nsupporting or opposing a candidate or ballot proposition. See,\ne.g., Mont. Admin. Rule 44.10.411(4); see also Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 78 (Congress “wished to promote full disclosure of\ncampaign-oriented spending to insure both the reality and\nappearance of purity and openness of the federal election pro-\ncess.”). The disclosure requirements are not designed to\n  16\n    Cal. Pro-Life II, which addressed a challenge brought by a multipur-\npose entity, applied strict scrutiny. 507 F.3d at 1178.\n\f2188           CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nadvise the public generally what groups may be in favor of,\nor opposed to, a particular candidate or ballot issue; they are\ndesigned to inform the public what groups have demonstrated\nan interest in the passage or defeat of a candidate or ballot\nissue by their contributions or expenditures directed to that\nresult. This point regarding the nature of the informational\ninterest becomes especially important when we examine\nwhether the Montana regulations as applied to the Church are\nsubstantially related to that interest.\n\n  C.    Substantial Relation\n\n   We next assess the “fit” between Montana’s disclosure\nrequirements and the State’s informational interest. We must\ndecide whether the informational value, as we have just\ndescribed it, to the public derived from disclosure of the\nChurch’s de minimis in-kind expenditures justifies the burden\nimposed by the reporting requirement. We note at the outset\nthat the question is one of degree, not kind, for it is well\nestablished that, in the ordinary case, a state informational\ninterest is sufficient to justify the mandatory reporting of\nexpenditures and contributions in the context of ballot initia-\ntives. See, e.g., Alaska Right To Life Comm., 441 F.3d at\n789-92 (upholding disclosure requirements under strict scru-\ntiny); Cal. Pro-Life II, F.3d at 1189 (endorsing disclosure\nrequirements in the context of ballot initiatives on the author-\nity of Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 262).\n\n   In Buckley, the Supreme Court reviewed a federal reporting\nscheme requiring record-keeping of contributions above $10\nand disclosure of contributions above $100. Buckley, 424 U.S.\nat 82-85. It noted that, in setting thresholds for disclosure of\ncampaign finance activities, “[t]he line is necessarily a judg-\nmental decision, best left in the context of this complex legis-\nlation to congressional discretion.” Id. at 83. It concluded that,\non the “bare record” before the Court, “the limits designated\n[we]re [not] wholly without rationality,” even though there\nwas “little in the legislative history to indicate that Congress\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2189\nfocused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require\nrecording and disclosure.” Id. (footnote omitted). Because the\nfederal statute did not require disclosure of contributions\nbelow $100, the Court expressly reserved judgment on\nwhether “information concerning gifts [between $10 and\n$100] can be made available to the public without trespassing\nimpermissibly on First Amendment rights.” Id. at 84.\n\n   [10] The question, then, becomes whether Montana’s “zero\ndollar” threshold for disclosure is “wholly without rationali-\nty.” Id. at 83. On the one hand, we recognize the principle that\n“signals are transmitted . . . not only by a contribution’s size\nbut also by the contributor’s identity.” Vote Choice v. DiSte-\nfano, 4 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 1993). On the other hand, we\ncannot say that the informational value derived by the citi-\nzenry is the same across expenditures of all sizes. As we have\nexplained, in the ballot issue context, the relevant informa-\ntional goal is to inform voters as to “who backs or opposes a\ngiven initiative” financially, so that the voters “will have a\npretty good idea of who stands to benefit from the legisla-\ntion.” Cal. Pro-Life I, 328 F.3d at 1106. As a matter of com-\nmon sense, the value of this financial information to the\nvoters declines drastically as the value of the expenditure or\ncontribution sinks to a negligible level. As the monetary value\nof an expenditure in support of a ballot issue approaches zero,\nfinancial sponsorship fades into support and then into mere\nsympathy. In the present case, the voters could learn little\nabout the financial backing of the ballot proposition by gain-\ning access to information about the Church’s activities of\nminimal economic effect.\n\n   Meanwhile, the burden of reporting remains constant even\nthough the size of the in-kind expenditure decreases to a neg-\nligible level. The Commissioner of Political Practices has\nissued two forms applicable to incidental political commit-\ntees: Form C-2, “Statement of Organization”; and Form C-4,\nthe “Incidental Political Committee Finance Report.” Form\nC-2 requires a statement of purpose, the name and address of\n\f2190              CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nthe committee, its designated treasurer and other officers, and\nthe bank holding the committee’s depository account. Form\nC-4 goes further and requires a list of earmarked contributions\nreceived by the committee—including the donors’ names,\naddresses, occupations, employers, and amounts contributed\nfor contributions greater than $35—and expenditures made by\nthe committee—including amount, purpose, and name and\naddress of payee. While not exceedingly onerous, such\nrequirements undoubtedly constitute a burden, even in the\ncase of one-time expenditures, which may be reported in a\ncombined initial and closing report.\n\n   [11] We conclude that, if the Supreme Court’s “rationality”\ntest for threshold disclosure levels has any force at all, there\nmust be a level below which mandatory disclosure of cam-\npaign expenditures by “incidental committees” runs afoul of\nthe First Amendment. It may very well be that such a level is\nnot susceptible to dollar estimation or that all monetary con-\ntributions convey sufficiently valuable information about the\nsupporters of an initiative to justify the burden of disclosure.\nBut if we are to give any effect to Buckley’s “rationality” test,\nat some point enough must be enough. Applying the disclo-\nsure provisions to the Church’s de minimis in-kind expendi-\ntures lies beyond that point. Expending a few moments of a\npastor’s time, or a marginal additional space in the Church for\npetitions, is so lacking in economic substance that we have\nalready held that requiring their reporting creates fatal prob-\nlems of unconstitutional vagueness. Similarly, the value of\npublic knowledge that the Church permitted a single like-\nminded person to use its copy machine on a single occasion\nto make a few dozen copies on her own paper—as the Church\ndid in this case—does not justify the burden imposed by Mon-\ntana’s disclosure requirements.17\n   17\n      The State emphasizes that the retail nature of Montana politics\nrequires a low reporting threshold. True as that proposition may be, it does\nnot justify the burden of “incidental committee” reporting imposed as a\nconsequence of the extremely minimal in-kind expenditures attributed to\nthe Church in this case.\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2191\n   [12] We conclude that, by applying its disclosure provi-\nsions to the Church’s de minimis in-kind contributions in the\ncontext of a state ballot initiative, the Commission violated\nthe Church’s First Amendment rights. We limit our holding\nto this formulation. In this case, we are not concerned with—\nand express no view about—the constitutionality of Mon-\ntana’s disclosure requirements in the context of candidate\nelections or as applied to monetary contributions of any size.\nWe also do not purport to establish a level above de minimis\nat which a disclosure requirement for in-kind expenditures for\nballot issues passes constitutional muster. The fixing of any\nsuch level is for the Montana authorities in the first instance.\nWe are satisfied, however, that the application of Montana’s\ndisclosure requirements to the Church because of its de\nminimis activities in this case impermissibly infringes on the\nChurch’s free speech rights.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n   [13] For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Montana’s\ndisclosure and reporting requirements are unconstitutional as\napplied to the Church’s de minimis activities in connection\nwith CI-96. We reverse the judgment of the district court and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n  REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nNOONAN, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n   I gladly join the opinion of the court and write here to\naddress an issue briefed by both parties and not of inconse-\nquential importance: the constitutionality of MCA § 13-1-101\net seq. and the regulations thereunder in the light of the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n  Current constitutional doctrine permits “a neutral, generally\napplicable law” to operate even though its incidental effect is\n\f2192           CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nan impact on the exercise of religion. Employment Division v.\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872, 890 (1990). In contrast, a statute that is\nnot both of general applicability and neutral toward a reli-\ngious practice is constitutional only if justified by a compel-\nling government interest which the law is narrowly tailored to\nserve. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye., Inc. v. City of Hialeah,\n508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993). Is the Montana statute neutral and\ngenerally applicable? Is it narrowly tailored to serve a com-\npelling government interest?\n\n   The first question is answered by inspection of the statute.\nA large class of activities is exempted from its operation. A\nreportable contribution does not include “the cost of any bona\nfide news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through\nthe facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, maga-\nzine or other periodical publication of general circulation.”\nMCA § 13-1-101(7)(b)(2). The media are free to promote\npolitical opinions without registering as independent political\ncommittees and without disclosing the identity of those own-\ning the facilities used to promote the opinions. The most\nlikely sources of potent political input into an election are\nremoved from the statute’s scope. The generality of the statute\nis destroyed. The neutrality of the statute is preserved as to the\nmedia while all religious expressions on a ballot measure are\nswept within its requirements. The disparity between the\ntreatment of the media and the treatment of churches is great\nand gross.\n\n   It might be countered, “Of course the press doesn’t fall\nwithin the statute. Its freedom is protected by the First\nAmendment.” But if it is obvious that the freedom of the press\nwould be infringed by the statute’s requirements, is it not\nequally obvious that the free exercise of religion is burdened\nby them? To carve out an exemption for one kind of speech\n— that employed by the professional media — and deny the\nexemption to speech by a church is to achieve neither neutral-\nity nor general applicability.\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2193\n   The burden imposed by the statute on a church speaking its\nmind is not trivial, especially in the case of a church, such as\nthe Canyon Ferry Road Baptist Church of East Helena, Inc.,\na Southern Baptist entity possessed of its own identity and\ngovernance. The church consists of 400 members; it has a\npastor and a youth pastor and a part-time secretary. To com-\nply with the statute, the pastor would first have to understand\nwhat the statute requires in the framework of Montana elec-\ntion law. This understanding is not materially assisted by the\nregulations issued by the Commissioner of Political Practices,\nwhose statutory duty is “the control of political practices.” As\nwith many specialized statutes and the regulations issued\nunder them the advice of a good lawyer would be essential\nnot to fall afoul of the statute’s criminal penalties. Reading\nand understanding the statute with the help of counsel is the\nfirst burden imposed.\n\n   The second burden on the church is to convert itself for the\ntime being into an independent political committee, registered\nwith the state, equipped with a campaign treasurer, a deposi-\ntory, and a new name. Now minted as an IPC, this entity must\nfile a form with the Commissioner of Political Practices and\nwith the county within five days of making a political expen-\nditure. The IPC must also file a form with the Commissioner\nreporting contributions. It is easy to suppose these reporting\nand filing requirements are slight. They may be so for a large\nenterprise. They are care-demanding and time-consuming for\na small congregational church. In addition, the statute seeks\nthe names and the employers of the contributors of small\namounts of money. For business or social reasons, a small\ncontributor may wish not to be publicly identified with one\nside of a controversial public issue. The required report strips\nthis contributor of his chosen anonymity. This effect, which\ndiscourages contributors, is an additional burden on the\nchurch.\n\n   As for narrow tailoring to a compelling government inter-\nest, the Commissioner of Political Practices contrasts the bad\n\f2194           CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nold days of domination by the Anaconda Company with the\npresent healthy state of Montana politics, said to be due to the\ndisclosure law. The Commissioner does not even attempt to\nshow how the disclosure law has this beneficent effect.\n\n   The disclosure law leads to the disclosure of the names of\nthe makers of small contributions, said by the Commissioner\nto be a major factor in Montana elections. How do the names\nof small contributors affect anyone else’s vote? Does any\nvoter exclaim, “Hank Jones gave $76 to this cause. I must be\nagainst it!” Small contributors are not the Anaconda Com-\npany.\n\n   The Commissioner also argues that the report of in-kind\ncontributions by the church is helpful to the voters. But if the\nchurch’s corporate efforts are effective at all, both the sup-\nporters and opponents of a ballot measure will know where\nthe church stands and judge accordingly. They don’t need to\nconsult what is filed with the Commissioner.\n\n   What has happened here is that a small congregation has\nbeen put to trouble and expense in order to exercise its right\nto speak on an issue seen by it to be of vital religious signifi-\ncance. One lesson of history is that small incursions on free-\ndom are to be resisted lest they grow greater.\n\n   I noted earlier the exemptions of the press from the disclo-\nsure statute. An unregulated, unregistered press is important\nto our democracy. So are unregulated unregistered churches.\nChurches have played an important — no, an essential — part\nin the democratic life of the United States. On two of the\ngreatest issues ever to confront our country, churches led the\nway and churchmen conducted crusades.\n\n  The first decided whether this nation should be half free\nand half slave. Not only the slaveowners but many persons of\nequable temperament and moderate judgment hesitated to dis-\nlodge an institution that had existed in America for over 200\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v.

Church-\nmen — principally Congregationalists and Unitarians — took\nup the cause of universal freedom and over bitter opposition\nand armed rebellion assured the triumph of what they put for-\nward as a Christian cause.\n\n   A century later, when the fruits of freedom had been imper-\nfectly realized and African-Americans still suffered griev-\nously from discriminatory laws and practices, Christian\nchurchmen again led the way in what has been aptly described\nby one of its leaders, the Reverend Joseph Lowery, as “the\nblack church coming alive.” Its opening moments occurred in\n1955 in Montgomery, Alabama when Rosa Parks refused to\nmove to the back of the bus and was arrested for violating a\nmunicipal ordinance segregating bus seating by race. Martin\nLuther King, Jr., a local pastor, emerged as the leader of a\nboycott of the buses by blacks. At each critical stage King\nspoke in the language of religion. At the first mass meeting\nhe quoted the words of Jesus as reported in the Gospels, told\nthe crowd that their protest should be “with Christian love,”\nand gave as advice, “Let your conscience be your guide.” The\ncrowd sang “Onward Christian Soldiers.” When his house\nwas bombed, King cooled the crowd saying, “What we are\ndoing is just. God is with us.” For King, conscience was a\ntrumpet. The Lustre of Our Country (1998) 256.\n\n   Is it necessary to evoke these historic struggles and the\ngreat constitutional benefits won for the country by its\nchurches in order to decide this case of petty bureaucratic\nharassment? It is necessary. The memory of the memorable\nbattles grows cold. The liberals who applaud their outcomes\nand live in their light forget the motivation that drove the\nchampions of freedom. They approve religious intervention in\nthe political process selectively: it’s great when it’s on their\nside. In a secular age, Freedom of Speech is more talismanic\nthan Freedom of Religion. But the latter is the first freedom\nin our Bill of Rights. It is in terms of this first freedom that\nthis case should be decided.\n\f",

Following an\nadverse administrative decision by the Montana Commis-\nsioner of Political Practices, the Church brought this action in\nfederal court, claiming that the Commissioner’s decision vio-\nlated its First Amendment and due process rights and seeking\ndeclaratory relief as well as nominal damages. On cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court upheld the\nMontana law against all challenges. We reverse.\n\n                      BACKGROUND\n\n  Canyon Ferry Road Baptist Church, an incorporated reli-\ngious institution located in East Helena, Montana, generally\nadheres to the Christian doctrines of the Southern Baptist\nConvention. Among these doctrines is the belief that marriage\nmay exist only between one man and one woman.\n\n  In the spring of 2004, the Church’s Pastor, Berthold\nGotlieb Stumberg, III, became interested in possible ways in\n\f2172            CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nwhich the Church could assist in an effort to collect signatures\nto place Constitutional Initiative No. 96 (“CI-96”) on the\nMontana state ballot the following November. If placed on the\nballot and approved by Montana’s voters, CI-96 would amend\nthe Montana state constitution to define marriage as a union\nbetween one man and one woman. For the signatures to be\neffective, the signed petition forms had to be turned over to\nthe sponsoring organization and then submitted to appropriate\nelection officials no later than June 18, 2004.\n\n   In May 2004, Terri Paske, a member of the Church who\ncampaigned for CI-96 in partnership with Jeff Laszloffy,1\nprinted out a template CI-96 petition from the Montana Fam-\nily Foundation website and made less than fifty copies of the\npetition on the Church’s copy machine, using her own paper.\nWith Stumberg’s approval, Paske placed roughly twenty cop-\nies of the petition in the Church’s foyer.\n\n   At about the same time, Stumberg began making arrange-\nments for the Church’s congregation to view an audio-visual\nsimulcast entitled Battle for Marriage. The Battle for Mar-\nriage simulcast included presentations by several prominent\nreligious leaders on the topic of marriage. Stumberg planned\nto have it screened in connection with a regularly scheduled\nSunday evening service on May 23, 2004. There is no evi-\ndence in the record that the Church was charged any fees for\naccess to the Battle for Marriage simulcast.\n\n   The Church advertised the upcoming screening, which was\nopen to the public, through unpaid public service announce-\nments aired by five radio stations. Although the Church often\nincorporates simulcasts in its services and all of the Church’s\nservices are open to the public, the Battle for Marriage was\nthe only simulcast for which the Church secured public ser-\nvice announcements on the radio. In addition, the Church\n  1\n   Laszloffy was a sponsor of CI-96 and the president of its campaign\ncommittee, Montana Family Foundation.\n\f                 CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                     2173\nphotocopied and circulated flyers publicizing the event, the\ntemplate for which had been provided to the Church by the\norganizers of the simulcast. The flyers were placed in the\nChurch’s bulletin and Stumberg encouraged members of the\ncongregation to take the flyers to their workplace and “let\npeople see it.” The flyers did not mention CI-96.\n\n   On May 23, 2004, ninety-three people attended the Battle\nfor Marriage event, well above the average attendance for a\ntypical Sunday evening service at the Church. The congrega-\ntion and members of the public watched the Battle for Mar-\nriage simulcast. In addition to televised presentations by\nseveral Christian ministers, the simulcast discussed a pro-\nposed amendment to the United States Constitution that\nwould establish a definition of marriage as being solely\nbetween one man and one woman. It did not expressly sup-\nport or oppose any Montana ballot issue or candidate for pub-\nlic office.\n\n   After the Battle for Marriage program ended, Stumberg\nspoke to those in attendance about CI-96. He said that the\nthreat to marriage also existed in Montana, and that the con-\ngregation should resist it in prayer and by signing the CI-96\npetition. Stumberg told the audience that they “need[ed] to\nsign” the CI-96 petition and that he would “encourage[ ]\neveryone to sign it. This is one of the ways that we take a\nstand for righteousness.” He then indicated that CI-96 peti-\ntions were available in the foyer near the Church’s exits. The\nfollowing Sunday, Stumberg circulated the CI-96 petition for\nsignature among the attendees at each of the Church’s three\nservices that day during announcement time. The petitions\nremained available in the Church’s foyer for signature until\nthey were submitted on June 13, 2004.\n\n  By June 13, 2004, the petitions made available in the\nChurch’s foyer contained ninety-eight valid signatures of resi-\ndents of Lewis and Clark County.2 Ninety-two of these came\n  2\n   Similar forms were also available in the foyer for signature by resi-\ndents of two other counties. The record does not disclose how many signa-\n\f2174              CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nfrom members of the Church. Paske had the forms notarized\nand mailed copies of the signed petitions to the designated\ncounty officials for filing and to Laszloffy. The sponsors of\nCI-96 ultimately obtained the requisite number of signatures\nand the initiative was placed on the November ballot. It was\npassed by the voters of Montana by a margin 295,070 Yes\nvotes to 148,263 No votes (66.5% to 33.5%).\n\n   On May 26, 2004, an advocacy group called “Montanans\nfor Families and Fairness” filed a Campaign Finance and\nPractices Complaint against the Church. The complaint\nalleged that the Church, by its “expenditures” in connection\nwith the May 23 event to support CI-96, had created an “inci-\ndental political committee” within the meaning of Montana’s\ncampaign finance laws but had not filed the required disclo-\nsure forms. After completing an investigation, the state Com-\nmission of Political Practices (“Commission”) issued an\nadministrative decision. It found that\n\n     it is clear that when the Church and pastor Stumberg\n     chose to engage in activities supporting the effort to\n     place CI-96 on the ballot, the Church became an\n     incidental political committee under Montana law,\n     with corresponding reporting obligations. Use of the\n     Church’s facilities to obtain signatures on CI-96\n     petitions, along with Pastor Stumberg’s encourage-\n     ment of persons to sign the CI-96 petitions during\n     regularly scheduled Church services, obviously had\n     value to the campaign in support of CI-96. Pastor\n     Stumberg was not acting as a volunteer when he\n     engaged in the activities supporting CI-96, since\n\ntures were collected from residents of those counties, but suggests that the\ngreat majority of the signatures came from residents of Lewis and Clark\nCounty.\n\f                  CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                          2175\n      those activities occurred in the Church building and\n      during regularly scheduled Church services.3\n\n   The Church and Stumberg (collectively, the “Church”)\nbrought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory\nrelief and nominal damages. The Church challenges the Com-\nmissioner’s application of Montana’s disclosure and reporting\nprovisions. It argues that, as interpreted by the Commission,\nMontana’s disclosure and reporting provisions are impermiss-\nibly vague, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. It also argues that the provisions are\noverbroad and violate the Church’s First Amendment rights of\nfree speech, association, and free exercise of religion. The\nparties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and the dis-\ntrict court dismissed the complaint, rejecting all the claims\nasserted by the Church. The Church appeals. We have juris-\ndiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                 STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n\n   Since the 1970s, Montana has required “political commit-\ntees” to disclose expenditures and contributions made toward\ncandidate elections and ballot issues and to comply with addi-\ntional reporting requirements. In relevant part, the key term\n“political committee” is defined as “a combination of two or\nmore individuals or a person other than an individual who\nmakes a contribution or expenditure . . . to support or oppose\na ballot issue or a committee organized to support or oppose\na ballot issue . . . .” Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-1-101(20).4 Mon-\n  3\n     Unpaid services provided to candidates or political committees by indi-\nviduals volunteering their time are excluded from the statutory definitions\nof “contribution” and “expenditure.” Mont. Code Ann. § 13-1-101(7)(b)(i)\nand (11)(b)(i).\n   4\n     Individuals have no duty to report directly to the State the contributions\nand expenditures they make in connection with candidate elections or bal-\nlot initiatives. Their contributions to political committees or individual\ncandidates, however, are reported by the recipients as part of their report-\ning and disclosure obligations. Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-37-229(4). If an\nindividual’s aggregate contributions to a given candidate or committee are\ngreater than $35, the recipient must report the contributor’s full name,\nmailing address, occupation, and employer, if any. Id. § 13-37-229(2).\n\f2176                CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\ntana’s Administrative Rules refine this definition by differen-\ntiating among three different types of “political committees”:\n“principal campaign committees,” “independent committees,”\nand “incidental committees.” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.327(1).\nThe Commission found the Church to be an “incidental com-\nmittee,” which is defined as “a political committee that is not\nspecifically organized or maintained for the primary purpose\nof influencing elections but that may incidentally become a\npolitical committee by making a contribution or expenditure\nto support or oppose a candidate and/or issue.”5 Mont. Admin.\nR. 44.10.327(2)(c).\n\n   The designation of a group or entity as an “incidental com-\nmittee,” then, turns on the definition of the terms “contribu-\ntion” and “expenditure”; if two or more persons make a\ncontribution or expenditure for or against a candidate or ballot\nproposition, a committee has been formed. A “contribution”\nis defined as\n\n       an advance, gift, loan, conveyance, deposit, pay-\n       ment, or distribution of money or anything of value\n       to influence an election; a transfer of funds between\n       political committees [or] the payment by a person\n       other than a candidate or political committee of com-\n       pensation for the personal services of another person\n       that are rendered to a candidate or political commit-\n       tee.\n\nMont. Code. Ann. § 13-1-101 (7)(a)(i)-(ii).6 Similarly, an “ex-\npenditure” is defined as\n  5\n   “Issue” is defined by the statute as:\n      a proposal submitted to the people at an election for their\n      approval or rejection, including but not limited to initiatives, ref-\n      erenda, proposed constitutional amendments, recall questions,\n      school levy questions, bond issue questions, or a ballot question.\n§ 13-1-101(17).\n   6\n     The statute carves out from this definition of “contribution” the time\ndevoted by volunteers working on a campaign as well as any lodging and\n\f                  CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                        2177\n     a purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance,\n     promise, pledge, or gift of money or anything of\n     value made for the purpose of influencing the results\n     of an election.\n\n§ 13-1-101(11)(a). The term “anything of value”—which\naffects the scope of “expenditures” and “contributions” alike\n—is defined as “any goods that have a certain utility to the\nrecipient that is real and that is ordinarily not given away free\nbut is purchased.” § 13-1-101(3). Montana’s Administrative\nRules elaborate on the scope of these key provisions. The\nterms “expenditures” and “contributions” encompass “in-\nkind” expenditures and contributions, which refer—with\nsome exceptions irrelevant in this case—to “the furnishing of\nservices, property, or rights without charge or at a charge\nwhich is less than fair market value to a person, candidate, or\npolitical committee for the purpose of supporting or opposing\nany person, candidate, ballot issue or political committee\n. . . .” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.323(2).\n\n   Different types of “political committees” are subject to dif-\nferent reporting and disclosure obligations. As an “incidental\ncommittee,” the Church is required to report all transactions,\nregardless of the amount involved, that 1) qualify as “expen-\nditures” or “contributions” under the statute and regulations\nand 2) are made by the committee “in connection with a state-\nwide issue.” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.411(4). In addition, an\nincidental committee must also report every contribution that\nit receives if the contribution is “earmarked.”7 Mont. Admin.\nR. 44.10.411(5). Other donations, such as those that the\n\nmeals provided by individuals in their private residences, news or editorial\ncoverage in the media and an organization’s communications to its mem-\nbership. § 13-1-101 (7)(b).\n   7\n     A contribution is “earmarked” if it is “made with the direction, express\nor implied, that all or part of it be transferred to or expended on behalf of\na specified candidate, ballot issue, or petition for nomination.” Mont.\nAdmin. R. 44.10.519(1).\n\f2178             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nChurch ordinarily receives to support its regular operations,\nare not subject to any reporting or disclosure requirements.\n\n   Generally, an incidental committee is subject to periodic\nfilings which must be completed every quarter and at various\ntimes surrounding an election. Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-37-\n226(6); Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.411. If the incidental commit-\ntee makes a one-time political expenditure, however, it may\nfile a combined initial and closing report that terminates its sta-\ntus.8 In either case, the initial registration as an “incidental\ncommittee” must occur within five days of making a political\nexpenditure. § 13-37-201.\n\n   If a political committee fails to file a required report within\nthe required time periods, the Commissioner of Political Prac-\ntices may issue an order of noncompliance. § 13-37-121(2).\nUpon issuance of an order of noncompliance, a political com-\nmittee must submit the necessary information within five or\nten days, depending on whether the order is issued during an\nelection period or not, respectively. § 13-37-121(3)-(4). Fail-\nure to do so may result in the initiation of civil or criminal\nactions. Id. In the past ten years, the Commissioner has settled\nor dismissed all investigations it has commenced under these\nprovisions without filing a civil action, and the record dis-\ncloses no criminal prosecutions.\n\n                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment.

It argues, inter\nalia, that, as applied to its activities, the Montana statute is\nimpermissibly vague. We agree in part with the Church’s\nvagueness claim and hold that, as applied to (1) the placement\nof the petition in its foyer and (2) Stumberg’s exhortation to\nsign the petition in support of CI-96 during a regularly sched-\nuled Sunday service, the Commission’s interpretation of “in-\nkind expenditures” is unconstitutionally vague.\n\n   We also agree that the designation of the Church as an “in-\ncidental committee” because of its one-time, in-kind “expen-\nditures” of de minimis economic effect violates the Church’s\nFirst Amendment free speech rights.9\n\n                             Vagueness\n\n   [1] The thrust of the Church’s vagueness challenge is that\nthe definition of in-kind expenditures and contributions10\n  9\n   Our disposition of the vagueness and free speech issues makes it\nunnecessary for us to address the Church’s additional challenges based on\nFirst Amendment rights of association and free exercise of religion.\n  10\n     Although the Commission expressly rejected the contention that the\nChurch’s activities amounted to “coordinated expenditures,” it is not\nentirely clear whether the Commission considered the Church’s activities\n\f2180              CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nunder Montana law “fails to provide people of ordinary intel-\nligence a reasonable opportunity to understand” whether their\nactivities require disclosure under the statute. Hill v. Colo-\nrado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (2000). Montana law defines an “in-\nkind expenditure” as “the furnishing of services, property, or\nrights without charge or at a charge which is less than fair\nmarket value to a person, candidate, or political committee for\nthe purpose of supporting or opposing any person, candidate,\nballot issue or political committee.” Mont. Admin. R.\n44.10.323(2)11; see also Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.321(2)(a)\n(providing a similar definition of in-kind contributions).\n\n   On their face, the Montana regulations are precise enough.\nThe hallmark of an “in-kind” participation in a campaign\nfinance effort is the provision of a good or service either\n“without charge” or with a charge below its fair market value.\nFor example, extended provision of vehicles or rental space\nwithout charge are common types of in-kind political expen-\nditures or donations that clearly fall within this definition. We\nhave no doubt, therefore, that the Montana regulation poses\nno vagueness problem in the “ ‘vast majority of its intended\napplications.’ ” Hill, 530 U.S. at 733 (quoting United States\nv. Raines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1960)). We accordingly reject the\nChurch’s claim that the regulation is void for vagueness on its\nface. See id.\n\nin-kind expenditures or in-kind contributions. This distinction does not\naffect our analysis, however, because, in this case, we are concerned only\nwith disclosure, not substantive restrictions on campaign finance. To avoid\nrepetitions, we assume that the Commission considered the Church’s\nactivities in-kind expenditures.\n   We also note that the Commission does not appear to have relied on the\nregulation extending the reach of “expenditures” to “[e]xpenses incurred\nin support of or opposition to the drafting, printing, distribution and col-\nlection of signatures for any petition for nomination or a statewide ballot\nissue.” Mont. Admin. R. 44.10.323(1)(c).\n   11\n      This definition is quite similar to the comparable definition of in-kind\ncontributions in federal regulations. See 11 C.F.R. § 100.52(d).\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH                2181\n   [2] The application of the regulation to the Church’s activi-\nties in this case presents a different question, however. Unlike\nthe federal disclosure law, 2 U.S.C. §§ 431(4)(A),\n434(b)(3)(A), the Montana disclosure and reporting require-\nments are triggered by any in-kind expenditure or contribu-\ntion, no matter how negligible its value. See Mont. Admin. R.\n44.10.411(4). The absence of a minimum value threshold sub-\nstantially affects the analysis of the disclosure requirement’s\nvagueness. As the commercial value of a certain activity in\nsupport of a candidate or ballot issue approaches zero, it\nbecomes increasingly difficult for the party engaging in the\nactivity to know whether his or her activity could possibly be\nconsidered a “service.” This case presents a classic illustration\nof the problem.\n\n   The Church’s activities relied on by the Commission\nincluded (1) allowing Paske to photocopy a CI-96 petition\nform on the Church’s copy machine, with her own paper; (2)\nplacing the CI-96 petitions in the Church’s foyer; and (3)\nStumberg’s exhortation to sign the CI-96 petition during a\nregularly scheduled sermon on May 23, 2004. The Commis-\nsion apparently found that all three of these activities consti-\ntuted “in-kind expenditures.” We conclude that, as applied to\nthe second and third activities, the definition of “in-kind\nexpenditure” is impermissibly vague.\n\n   [3] In extending the reach of “in-kind expenditures” to\ncover Stumberg’s endorsement and the Church’s acquies-\ncence in making the petition available in its foyer, the Com-\nmission apparently concluded that these activities amounted\nto “services.” With respect to Stumberg’s exhortation, the the-\nory adopted by the Commission is that any otherwise qualify-\ning political activity, if performed within the scope of one’s\nemployment, amounts to a “service.” The same theory\nappears to have driven the Commission’s conclusion with\nrespect to the Church’s decision to let Paske “use its facili-\nties” to display the petition.\n\f2182             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\n   [4] When a group’s “services” are accompanied by either\na detriment to the provider of the service—say, an out-of-\npocket expense or the preclusion of other activities—or an\nascertainable market value, notice that a service has been pro-\nvided is inherent in the provision of the service itself. But\nwhen the activity in question brings no detriment to the puta-\ntive incidental committee and carries no market value, the\nnotice fails. In that case, a group engaging in a certain activity\nfor the purpose of supporting a candidate or ballot issue is left\nwith no objective guidance as to whether it has provided a\n“service”; the best it can do is rest on its members’ subjective\nintent12 and guess what effect their conduct will have on the\nintended beneficiary. Under the Commission’s interpretation\nof “in-kind expenditures,” an activity that might not appear to\nbe an expenditure becomes one if the activity turns out to\nhave been of value to the beneficiary, even though that value\nmay not become apparent until after the reporting date has\npassed. Such uncertainty does not “provide people of ordinary\nintelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand” whether\ntheir activities require disclosure under the statute. Hill, 530\nU.S. at 732. We therefore conclude that Montana’s in-kind\nexpenditures provision may not be applied to the Church’s\nconduct when that conduct neither causes an economic detri-\nment to the Church nor carries an ascertainable market value.\n\n   [5] The Church’s placement of the petition in its foyer and\nStumberg’s endorsement of CI-96 do not bear the objective\nindicia that we have just specified. There is no indication that\nthe Church suffered any detriment from either placing a few\nsheets of paper in its foyer or having its pastor engage in a\nbrief discussion of CI-96. Nor do we accept the State’s char-\n  12\n    An expenditure or contribution requires an intent “to influence an\nelection.” Mont. Code. Ann. § 13-1-101(7)(a)(i). In addition, for two or\nmore people to be subjected to “incidental political committee” reporting\nrequirements, their contribution or expenditure must be made “to support\nor oppose a candidate and/or [ballot] issue.” Mont. Admin. R.\n44.10.327(2)(c).\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2183\nacterization of the entire Battle for Marriage event and May\n23, 2004 service as a rally in support of the signature-\ngathering effort. The event took place in conjunction with a\nregularly scheduled service, the discussion of CI-96 took up\nbut a fraction of the program, and the Church paid no fee to\nsecure access to the simulcast. Finally, the Church would\nhave incurred the same maintenance expenses whether Stum-\nberg had discussed and endorsed CI-96 or not. We therefore\nconclude that the Church incurred no expense or otherwise\ncognizable detriment in connection with these two activities.\n\n   Moreover, while we do not doubt that the sponsors of\nCI-96 eventually derived some value from the activities in\nquestion, nothing in the record establishes that either the dis-\nplay of the petition in the foyer of the Church or the endorse-\nment of the Church’s pastor, without more, carry any\nobjective market value. Certainly, the Church was not in the\nbusiness of selling endorsements or renting out its foyer to\nthose wishing to advertise therein; nor does the record dis-\nclose any market to which the sponsors of CI-96 could have\nturned to secure comparable assistance in exchange for a fee.\n\n   [6] We therefore conclude that, because the display of the\npetition in the Church’s foyer and Stumberg’s endorsement\ndid not bring about a detriment to the Church or carry ascer-\ntainable market value, the Church had no way to know ex ante\nthat, by engaging in these two activities, it was actually pro-\nviding a “service” that would later be considered an in-kind\nexpenditure in support of CI-96. As applied to these services,\nthe Montana regulations defining in-kind contributions are\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n   [7] In contrast, we conclude that, as applied to the Church’s\nacquiescence with Paske’s use of its copy machine to photo-\ncopy the template CI-96 petition, Montana’s definition of in-\nkind expenditure poses is not unconstitutionally vague. Unlike\nStumberg’s endorsement or the placement of the petition in\nthe Church’s foyer, the provision of a copy machine meets the\n\f2184             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nobjective criteria that we have set forth above. It is clear that\nthe Church incurred some, albeit de minimis, expense in the\nwear and tear of its equipment; it is also clear that Paske\nwould have been charged if she had secured the same photo-\ncopying services on the open market. It is not unreasonable to\ncharge the Church with knowledge that it was providing a ser-\nvice of some market value. Accordingly, we conclude that the\nregulations defining in-kind contribution are not impermiss-\nibly vague as applied to the copying service. That conclusion\ndoes not end our constitutional inquiry, however, for the\nChurch also challenges the regulations on First Amendment\nfree speech grounds.\n\n                      Free Speech Challenge\n\n   The Church challenges the financial and organizational dis-\nclosures that a group of two or more people must make upon\nbecoming an “incidental committee.” The Church argues that,\nas applied to its activities, the disclosure requirements\nimposed under Montana law violate its First Amendment\nrights by imposing an unjustified burden on its constitution-\nally protected election-related “speech.” We conclude that, as\napplied to the one-time in-kind de minimis expenditures\ninvolved in this case, the state reporting requirements violate\nthe Church’s First Amendment rights.\n\n  A.    Degree of Scrutiny\n\n   The degree of scrutiny that we must apply to Montana’s\ndisclosure requirements with respect to the Church’s activities\nis somewhat unclear, due in part to arguably inconsistent pre-\ncedent and in part to the uncertain status of the Church as a\nmulti-purpose advocacy organization.13 See Alaska Right To\n  13\n     The Church presents most, but not necessarily all of the salient fea-\ntures of a multipurpose public advocacy organization that was held to be\nentitled to challenge restrictions on campaign expenditures under a strict\nscrutiny standard in FEC v.

Even under\nthis standard, the state disclosure requirement, as applied to\nthe Church’s de minimis in-kind expenditures, runs afoul of\nthe First Amendment.\n\n  B.     Informational Interest\n\n   The State articulates only one interest in defense of its dis-\nclosure scheme: providing its citizenry with information about\nthe constituencies supporting and opposing ballot issues. We\nare satisfied that this interest is “important.”\n\n(1986). Like Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the Church is a non-profit\norganization that cannot engage in business activities, has no shareholders\nor affiliated persons with a claim to assets or earnings and was not estab-\nlished by a corporation or business entity. See id. at 264. Unlike Massa-\nchusetts Citizens for Life, however, it was not “formed for the express\npurpose of promoting political ideas.” Id.\n   14\n      In Alaska Right to Life Comm., we similarly found it unnecessary to\nresolve the uncertainties over the standard of review, and applied the stan-\ndard most favorable to the non-prevailing party on appeal. Alaska Right\nto Life Comm., 441 F.3d at 788.\n\f2186             CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\n   [8] In Buckley and again in McConnell, the Supreme Court\nidentified three “important” interests that justified campaign\nfinance disclosure in the context of elections for federal\noffice: “providing the electorate with information, deterring\nactual corruption and avoiding any appearance thereof, and\ngathering the data necessary to enforce more substantive elec-\ntioneering restrictions.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196 (citing\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 67-68). Of these, the second interest—\ndeterring corruption or the appearance thereof—falls out of\nthe picture in the context of ballot initiatives, for such refer-\nenda present no risk of quid pro quo. See, e.g., First Nat’l\nBank of Boston v. Bellotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790 (1978) (“The\nrisk of corruption perceived in cases involving candidate elec-\ntions . . . is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.”);\nMont.

In addition, the state disclosure\nrequirements at issue in this case are evidently not substan-\ntially related to the third important interest: aid in enforcing\n“more substantive electioneering restrictions,” for no substan-\ntive limits on contributions or expenditures apply in the con-\ntext of Montana’s ballot issues. McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196\n(emphasis added); see Mont. Chamber of Commerce, 226\nF.3d at 1057-58 (striking down Montana’s ban on corporate\nexpenditures and contributions in ballot issues under Mont.\nCode Ann. § 13-35-227).\n\n   [9] With respect to the remaining interest, we have little\ntrouble concluding that Montana’s informational interest is\ngenerally “important” in the context of Montana’s statewide\nballot issues. Indeed, we recently observed that California had\nproduced evidence sufficient to qualify its informational inter-\nest in disclosure of contributions to a ballot issue as “compel-\nling.” Cal. Pro-Life II, 507 F.3d at 1179-80 nn.8&9. Although\nthe evidence put forth by Montana in this case is not as formi-\ndable as that provided by California in Cal. Pro-Life II,15\n   15\n      The evidence presented to the district court in Cal.

We also reject the suggestion that, because\nMontana’s election system appears to be open and highly\nfunctional, the need for disclosure is somehow decreased.

We conclude that, in the context of ballot\nissues in which this case arises, Montana’s interest in keeping\nits citizens well informed with respect to the groups finan-\ncially supporting and opposing voter initiatives remains “im-\nportant” today.\n\n   It is essential to keep in mind, however, just what informa-\ntion the State has determined that the public needs. The infor-\nmation to be disclosed is the identity of persons financially\nsupporting or opposing a candidate or ballot proposition. See,\ne.g., Mont. Admin. Rule 44.10.411(4); see also Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 78 (Congress “wished to promote full disclosure of\ncampaign-oriented spending to insure both the reality and\nappearance of purity and openness of the federal election pro-\ncess.”). The disclosure requirements are not designed to\n  16\n    Cal. Pro-Life II, which addressed a challenge brought by a multipur-\npose entity, applied strict scrutiny. 507 F.3d at 1178.\n\f2188           CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nadvise the public generally what groups may be in favor of,\nor opposed to, a particular candidate or ballot issue; they are\ndesigned to inform the public what groups have demonstrated\nan interest in the passage or defeat of a candidate or ballot\nissue by their contributions or expenditures directed to that\nresult. This point regarding the nature of the informational\ninterest becomes especially important when we examine\nwhether the Montana regulations as applied to the Church are\nsubstantially related to that interest.\n\n  C.    Substantial Relation\n\n   We next assess the “fit” between Montana’s disclosure\nrequirements and the State’s informational interest. We must\ndecide whether the informational value, as we have just\ndescribed it, to the public derived from disclosure of the\nChurch’s de minimis in-kind expenditures justifies the burden\nimposed by the reporting requirement. We note at the outset\nthat the question is one of degree, not kind, for it is well\nestablished that, in the ordinary case, a state informational\ninterest is sufficient to justify the mandatory reporting of\nexpenditures and contributions in the context of ballot initia-\ntives. See, e.g., Alaska Right To Life Comm., 441 F.3d at\n789-92 (upholding disclosure requirements under strict scru-\ntiny); Cal. Pro-Life II, F.3d at 1189 (endorsing disclosure\nrequirements in the context of ballot initiatives on the author-\nity of Mass. Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. at 262).\n\n   In Buckley, the Supreme Court reviewed a federal reporting\nscheme requiring record-keeping of contributions above $10\nand disclosure of contributions above $100. Buckley, 424 U.S.\nat 82-85. It noted that, in setting thresholds for disclosure of\ncampaign finance activities, “[t]he line is necessarily a judg-\nmental decision, best left in the context of this complex legis-\nlation to congressional discretion.” Id. at 83. It concluded that,\non the “bare record” before the Court, “the limits designated\n[we]re [not] wholly without rationality,” even though there\nwas “little in the legislative history to indicate that Congress\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2189\nfocused carefully on the appropriate level at which to require\nrecording and disclosure.” Id. (footnote omitted). Because the\nfederal statute did not require disclosure of contributions\nbelow $100, the Court expressly reserved judgment on\nwhether “information concerning gifts [between $10 and\n$100] can be made available to the public without trespassing\nimpermissibly on First Amendment rights.” Id. at 84.\n\n   [10] The question, then, becomes whether Montana’s “zero\ndollar” threshold for disclosure is “wholly without rationali-\nty.” Id. at 83. On the one hand, we recognize the principle that\n“signals are transmitted . . . not only by a contribution’s size\nbut also by the contributor’s identity.” Vote Choice v. DiSte-\nfano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629116\"><a href=\"/opinion/629116/vote-choice-inc-v-joseph-distefano-etc-elizabeth-leonard-vote/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1st Cir. 1993). On the other hand, we\ncannot say that the informational value derived by the citi-\nzenry is the same across expenditures of all sizes. As we have\nexplained, in the ballot issue context, the relevant informa-\ntional goal is to inform voters as to “who backs or opposes a\ngiven initiative” financially, so that the voters “will have a\npretty good idea of who stands to benefit from the legisla-\ntion.” Cal. Pro-Life I, 328 F.3d at 1106. As a matter of com-\nmon sense, the value of this financial information to the\nvoters declines drastically as the value of the expenditure or\ncontribution sinks to a negligible level. As the monetary value\nof an expenditure in support of a ballot issue approaches zero,\nfinancial sponsorship fades into support and then into mere\nsympathy. In the present case, the voters could learn little\nabout the financial backing of the ballot proposition by gain-\ning access to information about the Church’s activities of\nminimal economic effect.\n\n   Meanwhile, the burden of reporting remains constant even\nthough the size of the in-kind expenditure decreases to a neg-\nligible level. The Commissioner of Political Practices has\nissued two forms applicable to incidental political commit-\ntees: Form C-2, “Statement of Organization”; and Form C-4,\nthe “Incidental Political Committee Finance Report.” Form\nC-2 requires a statement of purpose, the name and address of\n\f2190              CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nthe committee, its designated treasurer and other officers, and\nthe bank holding the committee’s depository account. Form\nC-4 goes further and requires a list of earmarked contributions\nreceived by the committee—including the donors’ names,\naddresses, occupations, employers, and amounts contributed\nfor contributions greater than $35—and expenditures made by\nthe committee—including amount, purpose, and name and\naddress of payee. While not exceedingly onerous, such\nrequirements undoubtedly constitute a burden, even in the\ncase of one-time expenditures, which may be reported in a\ncombined initial and closing report.\n\n   [11] We conclude that, if the Supreme Court’s “rationality”\ntest for threshold disclosure levels has any force at all, there\nmust be a level below which mandatory disclosure of cam-\npaign expenditures by “incidental committees” runs afoul of\nthe First Amendment. It may very well be that such a level is\nnot susceptible to dollar estimation or that all monetary con-\ntributions convey sufficiently valuable information about the\nsupporters of an initiative to justify the burden of disclosure.\nBut if we are to give any effect to Buckley’s “rationality” test,\nat some point enough must be enough. Applying the disclo-\nsure provisions to the Church’s de minimis in-kind expendi-\ntures lies beyond that point. Expending a few moments of a\npastor’s time, or a marginal additional space in the Church for\npetitions, is so lacking in economic substance that we have\nalready held that requiring their reporting creates fatal prob-\nlems of unconstitutional vagueness. Similarly, the value of\npublic knowledge that the Church permitted a single like-\nminded person to use its copy machine on a single occasion\nto make a few dozen copies on her own paper—as the Church\ndid in this case—does not justify the burden imposed by Mon-\ntana’s disclosure requirements.17\n   17\n      The State emphasizes that the retail nature of Montana politics\nrequires a low reporting threshold. True as that proposition may be, it does\nnot justify the burden of “incidental committee” reporting imposed as a\nconsequence of the extremely minimal in-kind expenditures attributed to\nthe Church in this case.\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2191\n   [12] We conclude that, by applying its disclosure provi-\nsions to the Church’s de minimis in-kind contributions in the\ncontext of a state ballot initiative, the Commission violated\nthe Church’s First Amendment rights. We limit our holding\nto this formulation. In this case, we are not concerned with—\nand express no view about—the constitutionality of Mon-\ntana’s disclosure requirements in the context of candidate\nelections or as applied to monetary contributions of any size.\nWe also do not purport to establish a level above de minimis\nat which a disclosure requirement for in-kind expenditures for\nballot issues passes constitutional muster. The fixing of any\nsuch level is for the Montana authorities in the first instance.\nWe are satisfied, however, that the application of Montana’s\ndisclosure requirements to the Church because of its de\nminimis activities in this case impermissibly infringes on the\nChurch’s free speech rights.\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n   [13] For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Montana’s\ndisclosure and reporting requirements are unconstitutional as\napplied to the Church’s de minimis activities in connection\nwith CI-96. We reverse the judgment of the district court and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n  REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nNOONAN, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n   I gladly join the opinion of the court and write here to\naddress an issue briefed by both parties and not of inconse-\nquential importance: the constitutionality of MCA § 13-1-101\net seq. and the regulations thereunder in the light of the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n  Current constitutional doctrine permits “a neutral, generally\napplicable law” to operate even though its incidental effect is\n\f2192           CANYON FERRY ROAD v.

Is the Montana statute neutral and\ngenerally applicable? Is it narrowly tailored to serve a com-\npelling government interest?\n\n   The first question is answered by inspection of the statute.\nA large class of activities is exempted from its operation. A\nreportable contribution does not include “the cost of any bona\nfide news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through\nthe facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, maga-\nzine or other periodical publication of general circulation.”\nMCA § 13-1-101(7)(b)(2). The media are free to promote\npolitical opinions without registering as independent political\ncommittees and without disclosing the identity of those own-\ning the facilities used to promote the opinions. The most\nlikely sources of potent political input into an election are\nremoved from the statute’s scope. The generality of the statute\nis destroyed. The neutrality of the statute is preserved as to the\nmedia while all religious expressions on a ballot measure are\nswept within its requirements. The disparity between the\ntreatment of the media and the treatment of churches is great\nand gross.\n\n   It might be countered, “Of course the press doesn’t fall\nwithin the statute. Its freedom is protected by the First\nAmendment.” But if it is obvious that the freedom of the press\nwould be infringed by the statute’s requirements, is it not\nequally obvious that the free exercise of religion is burdened\nby them? To carve out an exemption for one kind of speech\n— that employed by the professional media — and deny the\nexemption to speech by a church is to achieve neither neutral-\nity nor general applicability.\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2193\n   The burden imposed by the statute on a church speaking its\nmind is not trivial, especially in the case of a church, such as\nthe Canyon Ferry Road Baptist Church of East Helena, Inc.,\na Southern Baptist entity possessed of its own identity and\ngovernance. The church consists of 400 members; it has a\npastor and a youth pastor and a part-time secretary. To com-\nply with the statute, the pastor would first have to understand\nwhat the statute requires in the framework of Montana elec-\ntion law. This understanding is not materially assisted by the\nregulations issued by the Commissioner of Political Practices,\nwhose statutory duty is “the control of political practices.” As\nwith many specialized statutes and the regulations issued\nunder them the advice of a good lawyer would be essential\nnot to fall afoul of the statute’s criminal penalties. Reading\nand understanding the statute with the help of counsel is the\nfirst burden imposed.\n\n   The second burden on the church is to convert itself for the\ntime being into an independent political committee, registered\nwith the state, equipped with a campaign treasurer, a deposi-\ntory, and a new name. Now minted as an IPC, this entity must\nfile a form with the Commissioner of Political Practices and\nwith the county within five days of making a political expen-\nditure. The IPC must also file a form with the Commissioner\nreporting contributions. It is easy to suppose these reporting\nand filing requirements are slight. They may be so for a large\nenterprise. They are care-demanding and time-consuming for\na small congregational church. In addition, the statute seeks\nthe names and the employers of the contributors of small\namounts of money. For business or social reasons, a small\ncontributor may wish not to be publicly identified with one\nside of a controversial public issue. The required report strips\nthis contributor of his chosen anonymity. This effect, which\ndiscourages contributors, is an additional burden on the\nchurch.\n\n   As for narrow tailoring to a compelling government inter-\nest, the Commissioner of Political Practices contrasts the bad\n\f2194           CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH\nold days of domination by the Anaconda Company with the\npresent healthy state of Montana politics, said to be due to the\ndisclosure law. The Commissioner does not even attempt to\nshow how the disclosure law has this beneficent effect.\n\n   The disclosure law leads to the disclosure of the names of\nthe makers of small contributions, said by the Commissioner\nto be a major factor in Montana elections. How do the names\nof small contributors affect anyone else’s vote? Does any\nvoter exclaim, “Hank Jones gave $76 to this cause. I must be\nagainst it!” Small contributors are not the Anaconda Com-\npany.\n\n   The Commissioner also argues that the report of in-kind\ncontributions by the church is helpful to the voters. But if the\nchurch’s corporate efforts are effective at all, both the sup-\nporters and opponents of a ballot measure will know where\nthe church stands and judge accordingly. They don’t need to\nconsult what is filed with the Commissioner.\n\n   What has happened here is that a small congregation has\nbeen put to trouble and expense in order to exercise its right\nto speak on an issue seen by it to be of vital religious signifi-\ncance. One lesson of history is that small incursions on free-\ndom are to be resisted lest they grow greater.\n\n   I noted earlier the exemptions of the press from the disclo-\nsure statute. An unregulated, unregistered press is important\nto our democracy. So are unregulated unregistered churches.\nChurches have played an important — no, an essential — part\nin the democratic life of the United States. On two of the\ngreatest issues ever to confront our country, churches led the\nway and churchmen conducted crusades.\n\n  The first decided whether this nation should be half free\nand half slave. Not only the slaveowners but many persons of\nequable temperament and moderate judgment hesitated to dis-\nlodge an institution that had existed in America for over 200\n\f               CANYON FERRY ROAD v. UNSWORTH               2195\nyears, protected by the constitution and the courts. Church-\nmen — principally Congregationalists and Unitarians — took\nup the cause of universal freedom and over bitter opposition\nand armed rebellion assured the triumph of what they put for-\nward as a Christian cause.\n\n   A century later, when the fruits of freedom had been imper-\nfectly realized and African-Americans still suffered griev-\nously from discriminatory laws and practices, Christian\nchurchmen again led the way in what has been aptly described\nby one of its leaders, the Reverend Joseph Lowery, as “the\nblack church coming alive.” Its opening moments occurred in\n1955 in Montgomery, Alabama when Rosa Parks refused to\nmove to the back of the bus and was arrested for violating a\nmunicipal ordinance segregating bus seating by race. Martin\nLuther King, Jr., a local pastor, emerged as the leader of a\nboycott of the buses by blacks. At each critical stage King\nspoke in the language of religion. At the first mass meeting\nhe quoted the words of Jesus as reported in the Gospels, told\nthe crowd that their protest should be “with Christian love,”\nand gave as advice, “Let your conscience be your guide.” The\ncrowd sang “Onward Christian Soldiers.” When his house\nwas bombed, King cooled the crowd saying, “What we are\ndoing is just. God is with us.” For King, conscience was a\ntrumpet. The Lustre of Our Country (1998) 256.\n\n   Is it necessary to evoke these historic struggles and the\ngreat constitutional benefits won for the country by its\nchurches in order to decide this case of petty bureaucratic\nharassment? It is necessary. The memory of the memorable\nbattles grows cold. The liberals who applaud their outcomes\nand live in their light forget the motivation that drove the\nchampions of freedom. They approve religious intervention in\nthe political process selectively: it’s great when it’s on their\nside. In a secular age, Freedom of Speech is more talismanic\nthan Freedom of Religion. But the latter is the first freedom\nin our Bill of Rights. It is in terms of this first freedom that\nthis case should be decided.\n\f</pre>",
