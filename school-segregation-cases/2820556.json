(\"Cabletron\").<br><br>          Craig  Benson   and  Robert  Levine,   supervisory  employees  of<br><br>          Cabletron, were also defendants in the district court.<br><br>                    Plaintiff Scarfo claimed,  inter alia, that  defendants\r                                               _____ ____<br><br>          discriminated  against her on the basis of her sex and terminated<br><br>          her employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act,<br><br>          42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(f).<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Miller claimed, inter  alia, under Title VII\r                                               _____  ____<br><br>          for  retaliatory  discharge  based  on his  alleged  refusal,  as<br><br>          plaintiff  Scarfo's immediate supervisor, to discriminate against<br><br>          her by terminating her employment on the basis of her sex.<br><br>                    The  principal  claims  of  error  asserted  on  appeal<br><br>          challenge  instructions to the jury.  Each party opposing a claim<br><br>          of error asserts that no timely objection or request  was made in<br><br>          the trial court.<br><br>                    Counsel  representing defendants  on appeal  first came<br><br>          into   the  case  after  completion  of  the  jury  trial.    Not<br><br>          surprisingly,  they  seek  to present  contentions  substantially<br><br>          different  from those  presented  by defense  counsel during  and<br><br>          before the jury trial.  Whenever new counsel enter and raise  new<br><br>          contentions,   opposing  counsel   may   find  irresistible   the<br><br>          temptation  to counter with new contentions of their own.  Almost<br><br>          inevitably,  then, the entry into  a case of  new counsel for one<br><br><br>                                         -3-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          party  increases litigation burdens for all parties.  An award of<br><br>          attorneys' fees to a  prevailing party may offset this  burden in<br><br>          part.  But unfairness may remain to opposing parties if the trial<br><br>          or appellate court allows  new grounds of claim or  defense to be<br><br>          asserted.    For  this  reason,  among  others,  we  encounter  a<br><br>          threshold question in this case.<br><br>                    One way  of framing  the threshold question  neutrally,<br><br>          abjuring  \"plain error,\"  United States  v.

Thus, we affirm in substance,<br><br>          though  with  minor exceptions,  and  with  some modification  of<br><br>          amounts of awards, and on condition that a judgment amended as to<br><br><br>                                         -5-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          form be entered in the district court.<br><br>                    We first  explain the  terms of  the judgment  that was<br><br>          ordered  in the district  court and the  nature of  the claims of<br><br>          error.  Then we explain why, in the interests of justice, we hold<br><br>          that  each claim  of  error asserted  in  this appeal  is  either<br><br>          harmless  error  or  is raised  too  late  for  review under  the<br><br>          harmless error standard  and cannot be  sustained under the  more<br><br>          rigorous requirement that relief is to be granted only to avoid a<br><br>          miscarriage of justice.<br><br><br><br>                                          I.\r                                          I.<br><br>                    The first error  we address  is one not  raised by  the<br><br>          parties.   We consider  it because  it might  be thought to  have<br><br>          jurisdictional  implications.   The \"final  judgment\"  entered in<br><br>          this  case was, in its form, not literally in compliance with the<br><br>          requirement  that  \"[e]very  judgment shall  be  set  forth on  a<br><br>          separate document.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.<br><br>                    The district court made not one but a series of orders.<br><br>          In most  instances, the order is not  self-explanatory.  Instead,<br><br>          it refers to an opinion  or memorandum of the court to  which one<br><br>          must go  to understand  precisely the meaning  of the order.   In<br><br>          these circumstances,  if, for example, a  party seeks enforcement<br><br>          of the  judgment -- perhaps even after the case is closed and the<br><br>          file  is sent  to storage  -- the  parties and  any  other person<br><br>          required  to  act will  have  great difficulty  finding  out what<br><br>          exactly were the terms of the \"final judgment.\"<br><br><br>                                         -6-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In support  of our  jurisdiction, however,  we conclude<br><br>          that the  district court ordered  the functional equivalent  of a<br><br>          \"final judgment\" in a sequence of orders that includes:<br><br>                         the   \"Judgment\"   of   May   10,   1994<br><br>                    (incorporating,  first, the Order  of June 2,<br><br>                    1993 granting  in part  and  denying in  part<br><br>

and  Postjudgment<br><br>                    Interest.<br><br>                    Were  we to remand for entry of a \"final judgment\" that<br><br>          is  formally in full compliance with Rule 58, before deciding the<br><br>          appeal  that has now  been briefed and argued,  the case would in<br><br>          due course be back before us again with precisely the same issues<br><br><br>                                         -7-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          to be decided as those we perceive from the record now before us.<br><br>          To avoid  the delay  and waste  of resources  incident to such  a<br><br>          remand, we proceed  to consider  the issues now  and will  direct<br><br>          entry of an appropriate amended judgment on remand.<br><br>                    From  close  examination  of  the  several  orders  and<br><br>          memoranda identified  above, we conclude that a final judgment of<br><br>          the substance gleaned  from all these  orders would have  recited<br><br>          provisions in substance as follows:<br><br>                         (a)   judgment  for plaintiff  Scarfo on<br><br>                    her claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights<br><br>                    Act for sex discrimination against defendants<br><br>

Equal  Pay<br><br>                    Act,   in   the   sum   of   $28,000  without<br><br>                    prejudgment interest;<br><br>                         (e)   judgment for defendants

Cabletron is dismissed;<br><br>                         (g)    plaintiff  Scarfo's   claims  for<br><br>                    breach   of   contract  and   defamation  are<br><br>

Levine, and Cabletron are dismissed;<br><br>                         (k)    all  claims by  plaintiff  Miller<br><br>                    against defendant Levine are dismissed;<br><br>                         (l)     it   is  further   ordered  that<br><br>                    plaintiff  Miller  will  not  be  allowed  to<br><br>                    collect  more  than  the larger  of  the  two<br><br>                    awards in his favor against  Cabletron as set<br><br>                    forth in paragraphs (h) and (i).<br><br>                    The substance of paragraph (l) is not explicitly stated<br><br>          in any of the orders identified above.  Implicit in  those orders<br><br>          and  the basis  on  which they  are  explained in  the  memoranda<br><br>          referred  to,  however, is  an  assumption  that  the  awards  to<br><br>          plaintiff Miller  overlap.  Because duplicative  collection would<br><br>          be impermissible,  we conclude it is appropriate to interpret the<br><br>          trial court's orders as  providing that Miller not be  allowed to<br><br>          collect more than the  larger (i.e., the Title VII  award) of the<br><br><br>                                         -10-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          two awards against Cabletron.  See Part XIV, infra.\r                                         ___           _____<br><br>                    On July 19, 1994, the district court awarded attorneys'<br><br>          fees and disbursements to plaintiffs.  Thus, two more paragraphs,<br><br>          as  stated below, may be added to reflect the entire substance of<br><br>          a  final judgment that includes awards of attorneys' fees.  These<br><br>          provisions,  we  note, might  have been  made  in a  later order,<br><br>          rather than in the \"final judgment\" itself.  See Fed.  R. Civ.

It is awkward to change<br><br>          instructions after the jury has  commenced deliberating, and as a<br><br>          practical  matter,  once  the   jury  has  been  disbanded  after<br><br>          returning a verdict, it  can never be called back to  receive the<br><br>          corrected charge that the  trial court might have given  if asked<br><br>          at the right time to do so.<br><br>                    Failure to exercise the right to  object to the court's<br><br>          charge  at the critical moment  prescribed by Rule  51 results in<br><br><br>                                         -19-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the loss of an  opportunity for review  under a standard no  more<br><br>          burdensome for  the appellant  than the harmless  error standard.<br><br>          Unless the reviewing court concludes that the charge has caused a<br><br>          miscarriage of  justice or  has undermined  the integrity of  the<br><br>          judicial process,  the  charge is  treated  as having  an  effect<br><br>          closely  analogous to  law-of-the-case doctrine, and  for similar<br><br>          reasons of policy and fairness of process.

Because we conclude that the<br><br>          jury  would  have  reached the  same  verdict  even  had it  been<br><br>                                         -23-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          properly instructed, the  error was harmless.   Thus, it  readily<br><br>          follows that no  miscarriage of  justice or other  blight on  the<br><br>          judicial process has resulted from the error.<br><br>                    The  evidence  of  discrimination  is  powerful.     It<br><br>          contains numerous examples of Cabletron's different treatment  of<br><br>          Scarfo and her male  colleagues who were similarly situated.   On<br><br>          the other hand, it is also true that some evidence  in the record<br><br>          tends to  support defendants'  theory that Scarfo  was fired  for<br><br>          legitimate  business reasons.   In  these circumstances,  we must<br><br>          explain the evidence of record in somewhat greater detail.<br><br>                    Of  course,  a  jury  is   not  required  to  credit  a<br><br>          plaintiff's evidence, even if the evidence is uncontradicted, and<br><br>          neither are we.   But a realistic assessment of the likelihood of<br><br>          a different verdict in this case, had different instructions been<br><br>          given,  depends  in part  on an  examination  of the  strength of<br><br>          Scarfo's  evidence  and  the  findings  it  would  support.    We<br><br>          summarize that evidence.<br><br>                    The strongest evidence on record supporting defendants'<br><br>          theory  was  the  review  of  Scarfo  by  Brian  Miller, Scarfo's<br><br>          immediate supervisor  at Cabletron.    Miller's report  contained<br><br>          several  positive  comments.    But  negative  remarks  regarding<br><br>          Scarfo's management  and purchasing skills dominated  his review.<br><br>          Miller  also   reported  internal  discipline  problems   in  the<br><br>          purchasing department.<br><br>                    The  evidence on  record supporting  plaintiff Scarfo's<br><br>          theory, however, is overwhelming.<br><br><br>                                         -24-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    First, Scarfo's requests to improve her department were<br><br>          overlooked while the  same requests made by  her male replacement<br><br>          were  granted.    After  Scarfo  was hired  as a  buyer and  then<br><br>          promoted to purchasing  supervisor, she was  told that she  would<br><br>          not be eligible for a raise until July 1988.  Scarfo continued to<br><br>          receive a  buyer's salary, though she performed all the functions<br><br>          of a  supervisor.  But in this position she was repeatedly denied<br><br>          requests  to  hire additional  buyers,  train  staff, and  update<br><br>          equipment so that she could focus on her managerial duties.<br><br>                    After  Scarfo  was   terminated,  Justin  O'Connor,   a<br><br>          purchasing  manager,  was  allowed  to  hire  additional  buyers,<br><br>          upgrade equipment,  implement training programs,  and make  other<br><br>          improvements that Scarfo  had previously been  refused permission<br><br>          to make.  Further, unlike Scarfo, O'Connor was permitted to limit<br><br>          his  buying responsibilities so that he could devote more time to<br><br>          his managerial responsibilities.<br><br>                    Second,  when  the  purchasing  department moved  to  a<br><br>          larger  space, Scarfo  was  denied an  office  although her  male<br><br>          colleague was given a  separate office.  Craig Benson,  the chief<br><br>          operating officer at Cabletron,  did not want Scarfo to  have her<br><br>          own office.  Benson, however, knew that Tim Jacobs, who was hired<br><br>          with Scarfo, would have a separate office.<br><br>                    Third,  Scarfo's business trip  expenses were carefully<br><br>          examined.  In contrast,  the expenses of a male colleague who was<br><br>          on  the  same trip  were  not questioned.    Specifically, Benson<br><br>          examined Scarfo's expense vouchers  for a two-week business trip.<br><br><br>                                         -25-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          He  did not  review expense  vouchers of  Roger Lawrence,  a male<br><br>          employee who went on the same trip and whose expenses were nearly<br><br>          identical to those of Scarfo.<br><br>                    Fourth, Benson singled out Scarfo to take the blame for<br><br>          an over-purchase of circuit boards, although other employees were<br><br>          involved with this transaction.   Scarfo had ordered the  boards,<br><br>          but the boards  were subsequently  not needed.   Although  Benson<br><br>          knew that others  besides Scarfo were responsible for  this over-<br><br>          purchase, he  told Miller, \"I don't like  being ripped off, and I<br><br>          blame Jeanne Scarfo for this.\"<br><br>                    Fifth,  Scarfo was treated  differently with respect to<br><br>          stock  options.   Despite  Benson's explanation  that Scarfo  was<br><br>          omitted from the stock option list and his promise that she would<br><br>          be on the next list of stock recipients,  Scarfo, unlike her male<br><br>          counterparts, never received any stock options.<br><br>                    Sixth, in  addition to  the evidence of  these poignant<br><br>          examples of disparate treatment, correlated with gender, there is<br><br>          in the  record other strong  evidence of discrimination.   Scarfo<br><br>          offered evidence that in April 1990, Benson told Miller to hire a<br><br>          \"guy\"  for her  position, but  Miller refused.   Benson  said, \"I<br><br>          don't  care if you fire  or demote her, but I  want a guy in that<br><br>          position.\" Approximately ten days later, Miller was fired.<br><br>                    After Miller's  departure, Scarfo was demoted  to buyer<br><br>          but was asked to continue to perform all management functions.<br><br>                    In  October 1990,  when  Justin O'Connor  was hired  as<br><br>          purchasing manager, Benson told  him that he did not  like Scarfo<br><br><br>                                         -26-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          and urged O'Connor to fire her.  Only ten days after he came onto<br><br>          the  job, O'Connor wrote a  negative review of  Scarfo and placed<br><br>          her on probation through February 1991.<br><br>                    O'Connor terminated Scarfo on January 10, 1991, a month<br><br>          before  the probationary period  expired.  His  reason for firing<br><br>          Scarfo  was   her  failure   to  show   improvement.     In   the<br><br>          circumstances, it would have been difficult  for O'Connor to make<br><br>          a reasonable determination as to whether Scarfo's performance had<br><br>          improved  because Scarfo's  time records  indicated that  she was<br><br>          legitimately absent during her probation period.<br><br>                    Taking  into account  the  weight of  this evidence  of<br><br>          discrimination,  we   conclude  that   the  error  in   the  jury<br><br>          instructions  on Scarfo's Title VII  claim was not  an error that<br><br>          \"seriously affected  the fairness, integrity or public reputation<br><br>          of judicial  proceedings,\"  Lash,  943 F.2d at  152, or caused  a\r                                      ____<br><br>          miscarriage of justice, Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1269.\r                                  _______<br><br>                    We  conclude also  that no  other  basis exists  in the<br><br>          circumstances of this case to  warrant an exception from applying<br><br>          the use-or-lose  proposition stated in Rule 51  and explained, in<br><br>          Part  III  of this  Opinion, as  a  principle aimed  at achieving<br><br>          outcomes of jury trial that are fair and just on the merits.<br><br><br><br>                           V.

As defendants did not use the right, we review the record<br><br>          before us only for evidence of a miscarriage of justice.<br><br>                    In  addition to  the  evidence summarized  in Part  IV,<br><br>          above,  we note additional support  in the record  for the jury's<br><br>          finding on the EPA claim.<br><br>                    Scarfo's economic expert testified that he reviewed and<br><br>          processed  Cabletron  data  on  pay  increments,  education,  and<br><br>          employment  history.   His analysis  showed a  $14,000 difference<br><br>          between  male   and  female   pay  for  Cabletron   managers  and<br><br>          supervisors.  The program accounted for education and seniority.<br><br>                    Further, the  evidence in  the record before  the jury,<br><br><br>                                         -28-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          and before us,  includes data  from personnel files  for men  and<br><br>          women holding similar positions.   For example, at the  same time<br><br>          Cabletron  hired Scarfo, it hired Tim Jacobs.  Unlike Scarfo, who<br><br>          was paid a starting salary of $27,000, Jacobs was given the title<br><br>          of supervisor and paid a starting salary of $35,000.<br><br>                    Moreover, in 1990,  Cabletron hired Justin  O'Connor as<br><br>          purchasing manager at a salary of $65,000.<br><br>                    In  an   attempt  to  justify  this   pay  discrepancy,<br><br>          defendants  call attention  to  evidence that  O'Connor had  more<br><br>          education and  vastly greater experience than Scarfo.   Given the<br><br>          strength of the evidence supporting the EPA claim, however, it is<br><br>          very  unlikely that  the  jury would  have  returned a  different<br><br>          verdict had the  error in the  instruction been corrected  before<br><br>          they deliberated.<br><br><br><br>                VI.  SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM\r                VI.  SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM<br><br>          A.   The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for\r          A.   The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for<br>               Instruction\r               Instruction<br><br>                    Scarfo presents on appeal  a contention that she frames<br><br>          as  a single  alleged error  in  the charge  to the  jury on  her<br><br>          hostile environment claim.  In our  view, however, the contention<br><br>          raises two  issues that,  though interwoven and  related, involve<br><br>          distinct points,  neither of which  was clearly expressed  in the<br><br>          objection before the trial court.<br><br>                    First,   Scarfo  argues   that  the   court   erred  in<br><br>          instructing  the  jury that  Scarfo  had  to prove  \"unreasonable<br><br>          interference  with her  work performance\"  as an  element  of her\r                                                            _______<br><br>                                         -29-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          claim.<br><br>                    Second, Scarfo  argues, at  least implicitly,  that the<br><br>          court  should  have  instructed  that  in  order  to   show  such<br><br>          interference, the  plaintiff  did  not need  to  prove  that  her<br><br>          tangible productivity had declined,  but only that the harassment<br><br>          so  altered her working conditions  as to make  it more difficult<br><br>          for her to do the job.<br><br>                    Defendants argue  that the  objection, quoted  from the<br><br>          transcript  in  Part  II.C  above,  lacked  the  specificity  and<br><br>          distinctness required by Rule 51 to preserve for appeal any issue<br><br>          regarding the instructions to the jury on the hostile environment<br><br>          claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.\r                  ___<br><br>                    We conclude that  the language of the objection is less<br><br>          explicit than a well-crafted objection  should be.  Although  the<br><br>          objection was  sufficient to inform  the trial court  that Scarfo<br><br>          contended  she was entitled to a \"factors\" instruction as part of<br><br>          the  Title VII charge, it failed to proffer a correct instruction<br><br>          or  in any  other way  to explain  how the  alleged error  in the<br><br>          charge  could  be  corrected.    Also,  the  objection  failed to<br><br>          identify explicitly  the second of  the two issues  stated above,<br><br>          and to explain how the alleged error could be corrected.<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo's objection  thus fell  short of  the<br><br>          clarity  and precision required to  alert the trial  judge to the<br><br>          contentions  now advanced  on  appeal.   It  matters not  whether<br><br>          Scarfo  had by that time  formulated the contentions  as they are<br><br>          now  argued   (rather  than  developing   them  through   further<br><br><br>                                         -30-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          reflection during  later proceedings,  either in the  trial court<br><br>          after verdict,  or on appeal).  In any event, the trial court was<br><br>          not alerted to the contentions now advanced.<br><br>                    We  discuss the  two  related but  separable issues  in<br><br>          turn.<br><br><br><br>          B.   \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element\r          B.   \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo  says that  the  court  erred in  its<br><br>          instruction  to the  jury  that the  plaintiff  must prove  by  a<br><br>          preponderance of  the evidence  an abusive work  environment that<br><br>          \"unreasonably  interfered with her  work performance.\"  Plaintiff<br><br>          argues, citing Harris, that \"unreasonable interference\" was not a\r                         ______<br><br>          separate  element of the claim  (failure to prove  which would be\r                    _______<br><br>          fatal  to the claim),  but only a  factor to  be considered along<br><br>          with all other relevant factors in determining whether an abusive<br><br>          work environment had been proved.<br><br>                    In Scarfo's favor,  we accept the point that  the terms<br><br>          \"element\" and \"factor\",  as they appear in  judicial opinions and<br><br>          commentaries, often signify a key difference between two types of<br><br>          legal tests prescribed by law,  for use by decisionmakers (juries<br><br>          or  judges), in determining whether the  evidence in a particular<br><br>          case satisfies the requirements for a legal theory (of a claim or<br><br>          defense).<br><br>                    One  type   of  legal  test  prescribes   two  or  more<br><br>          \"elements\"  of  a  claim or  defense.    Each  \"element\" must  be<br><br>          satisfied.

One of these \"elements\" is that<br><br>          the work environment was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"<br><br>                    Second, the test (or \"sub-test,\" one may prefer to say,<br><br>          to distinguish between the overall test and the internal test for<br><br>          one  \"element\") for determining whether one of the \"elements\" has<br><br>          been satisfied is a  \"factors\" type of test.   More specifically,<br><br>          one  of  the  elements  of  the Harris  test  is  proof  that the\r                                          ______<br><br>          environment  in  which  the  plaintiff worked  was  \"hostile\"  or<br><br>          \"abusive.\"   And the test  (or sub-test) for  determining whether<br><br>          this  \"element\"  has been  satisfied in  a  particular case  is a<br><br>          \"factors\"  test.

Justice Scalia noted that<br><br>                    \"[o]ne  of  the  factors  mentioned   in  the<br>                    Court's  nonexhaustive  list  -- whether  the<br>                    conduct   unreasonably  interferes   with  an<br>                    employee's  work performance -- would,  if it<br>                    were made an  absolute test, provide  greater<br>                    guidance to juries and  employers.

It did\r                          ______<br><br>          not  acknowledge  that the  Harris test  is  in some  respects an\r                                      ______<br><br>          \"elements\" test,  one element being that the work environment was<br><br>          hostile or abusive.  Thus, the trial judge was not alerted to why<br><br>          his use of the language of an \"elements\" test in the charge might<br><br>          be error because  of the particular  way he used it,  even though<br><br>          language such as his would be  proper and even essential as  part<br><br>          of an entirely correct instruction.<br><br>                    Second, the  objection did not  correctly formulate the<br><br>          Harris \"element\" over which there was dispute and satisfaction of\r          ______<br><br>          which must  be  determined by  a  \"factors\" test  (or  sub-test).<br><br>          Thus, even  if the trial judge  understood plaintiff's contention<br><br>          that some  aspect, at  least, of  the overall  Harris test  was a\r                                                         ______<br><br>          \"factors\" test  (or sub-test) for deciding  whether one \"element\"<br><br>          was satisfied, still the objection did not formulate that element<br><br>          clearly enough to tell the trial judge how to correct the alleged<br><br>          error  in  his  instruction.   That  \"element,\"  as  now  clearly<br><br>          formulated  on appeal,   is  not \"unreasonable  interference with<br><br>          work performance.\"  It is, instead, that the work environment was<br><br>          hostile or abusive.<br><br>                    In general, objections to a trial judge's charge to the<br><br>          jury must be clear enough  and explicit enough to tell the  trial<br><br>          judge what  the party wishes the  trial judge to say  in order to<br><br><br>                                         -35-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          correct the alleged error.<br><br>                         See Linn v.

She  argues that the  court's instruction was<br><br>          erroneous  because  it  required  the   jury  to  find  that  the<br><br>          plaintiff's work  performance was inadequate  and that  harassing\r                                            __________<br><br>          discriminatory conduct was a cause of that inadequacy.

Nothing in any  of the opinions in Harris suggests,\r                                                           ______<br><br>          as  plaintiff now  does  on  appeal,  that  this  phrase  can  be<br><br>          interpreted  to mean only a tangible decline in productivity.  In\r                               ____<br><br>          addition,  the  plaintiff  has  not  shown   any  basis  for  our<br><br>          concluding that the particular instruction at issue in this case,<br><br>          either as a whole or in part, gave the jury the impression that a<br><br>          tangible decline in productivity  was something the plaintiff was<br><br>          required to prove as an element of her claim.<br><br>                    Viewed another way, plaintiff's  argument on appeal  is<br><br>          that the  trial court  should have  given an instruction  stating<br><br>          that the plaintiff can  prove unreasonable interference with work<br><br>          performance either (1) by proving that the discriminatory conduct<br><br>          would cause the quality or quantity of a reasonable person's work<br><br>          to decline  and the plaintiff's  work did so  decline; or (2)  by<br><br><br>                                         -40-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          proving  that a  reasonable person,  subjected to  the harassment<br><br>          that she proved, would  find, and the plaintiff did so find, that<br><br>          the harassment so altered  working conditions as to make  it more<br><br>          difficult  to  do  the job.    If  Scarfo  thought that  such  an<br><br>          instruction would  have been helpful to  the jury's understanding<br><br>          of her claim, Scarfo had the right and opportunity to make such a<br><br>          request.    No  such request  was  made  at  the critical  moment<br><br>          prescribed by Rule 51.<br><br><br><br>          D.

This kind of contention is controlled by Wells.\r                                                              _____<br><br>                    Appellant also argues that a substantial policy  reason<br><br>          mitigates against  a conclusion that  she has failed  to preserve<br><br>          her<br><br>          contention for appeal.  She maintains that if this court requires<br><br>          every party to  file a motion for new trial  as a prerequisite to<br><br>          appeal,  then even  parties who  prevail on  all of  their claims<br><br>          except one -- and decide against appealing the minor loss -- must<br><br>          move for a new trial in anticipation of filing a cross-appeal  if<br><br>          the  other  party  should  appeal.   Such  post-trial  procedure,<br><br>          appellant  urges us  to  conclude, would  unnecessarily clog  the<br><br>          docket.<br><br>                    Appellant  first raised  this  policy  argument in  her<br><br>          reply brief, affording  appellees no opportunity to respond.   In<br><br>          any  event, it  is unconvincing.   At  least  where, as  here, no<br><br>          satisfactory   explanation  has  been  advanced  for  appellant's<br><br>          failure to  seek a new trial, we  conclude that it is appropriate<br><br>          for us  to take account  of the fact  that trial counsel  had the<br><br>          opportunity to decide,  and may  in fact have  decided, that  the<br><br>          potential costs of a new trial outweighed the potential benefits.<br><br>          She  could  have  eased to  some  extent  the burdens  of  such a<br><br>          decision at the post-trial stage, by moving for new trial only as<br><br>          an alternative to a  motion for judgment as a matter  of law.

MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\r                       VII.  MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM<br><br>                    Miller  argues  that the  court  erred  in refusing  to<br><br>          instruct  on nonpecuniary  damages.   Cabletron responds  that in<br><br>          fact  the court did instruct on this subject.  The record reveals<br><br>          good reason for confusion over this matter.<br><br>                    During  a  colloquy  with  counsel before  the  closing<br><br>          arguments, the court stated its intention to instruct the jury on<br><br>          \"enhanced compensatory damages,\" and not to instruct the jury  on<br><br>          \"nonpecuniary damages.\"  Miller's  counsel objected at this point<br><br>          to the  omission of an  instruction on nonpecuniary  damages, and<br><br>          the court  expressly restated  its intention  not to instruct  on<br><br>          nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    Miller's counsel, in  reliance on  the court's  ruling,<br><br>          argued  in  his  closing  that  the jury  should  award  enhanced<br><br>          compensatory damages.  Miller's counsel did not argue to the jury<br><br><br>                                         -44-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          that it should award nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    When  the  court instructed  the  jury  just after  the<br><br>          closing arguments, it instructed on nonpecuniary damages, but did<br><br>          not instruct the jury on enhanced compensatory damages.  This was<br><br>          the opposite of the court's previously stated intention.<br><br>                    After the  court's instruction  in  this way,  Miller's<br><br>          counsel  objected -- ostensibly, to apprise the court of the fact<br><br>          that  the  court's  instructions   had  varied  from  its  stated<br><br>          intention.  Miller's counsel  requested that  \"the Court  reverse<br><br>          those two consistent with what you described this morning.\"  This<br><br>          statement  can reasonably  be  interpreted as  a  request for  an<br><br>          instruction  on  enhanced  compensatory  damages  to  replace the\r                                                                _______<br><br>          instruction  on nonpecuniary  damages.  Thus,  Miller's counsel's<br><br>          statement arguably indicated to the judge that Miller had changed<br><br>          his position since his original request.<br><br>                    Following  this colloquy,  the court  re-instructed the<br><br>          jury  on  the wrongful  discharge claim.    This time,  the court<br><br>          instructed the jury on enhanced compensatory damages, but did not<br><br>          withdraw its  earlier instruction on nonpecuniary  damages, or in<br><br>          any other way mention nonpecuniary damages.  No further objection<br><br>          was made by Miller's counsel.<br><br>                    It  is not  clear from  the record  whether  the second<br><br>          instruction was intended to substitute for the first instruction,\r                                      __________<br><br>          or  was intended  as  an  additional  instruction.    The  latter\r                                    __________<br><br>          interpretation  is supported by the form of the verdict, in which<br><br>          the jury  was instructed  to answer special  questions, including<br><br><br>                                         -45-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the damages questions referred to below.<br><br>                    The  jury awarded  Miller  $995,000 in  damages on  the<br><br>          wrongful discharge claim,  but awarded no \"enhanced  compensatory<br><br>          damages.\"   See  Jury Verdict,  Questions 4 and  5.   Although no\r                      ___<br><br>          question on the verdict form specifically addressed \"nonpecuniary<br><br>          damages,\"  Question 4,  which  refers to  damages generally,  may<br><br>          reasonably  have  been  construed by  the  jury  to include  both<br><br>          pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    In  these  circumstances,   the  instructions  and  the<br><br>          verdict  form did not preclude the jury from considering an award<br><br>          of   nonpecuniary  damages  in   accordance  with   the  original<br><br>          instruction,  and the jury's award of  $995,000 may have included<br><br>          such  an award.    Thus,  the  verdict  form  together  with  the<br><br>          instructions does not conclusively demonstrate that, as plaintiff<br><br>          Miller  urges,  the  jury was  not  instructed  on  the issue  of<br><br>          nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    Even  if  we were  to conclude  that  the jury  was not<br><br>          instructed on nonpecuniary damages, counsel's failure  to object,<br><br>          after the  \"substitute\" instruction was given, is  an obstacle in<br><br>          the  way  of  Miller's  asserting  error  with  respect  to  this<br><br>          instruction  on appeal.   Moreover,  Miller's  counsel's apparent<br><br>          reversal of his  position -- although arguably intended merely to<br><br>          apprise the court of its inconsistency -- weighs against allowing<br><br>          Miller to assert his original position on appeal.<br><br>                    In addition  to these  obstacles is another.

Beebe Rubber Co., 316 A.2d 549 (N.H.\r                    ___ _____     ________________<br>               1974)(noting   that   nonpecuniary   damages  are   not<br>               available  in  contract  actions,  and  holding  in the<br>               context of a wrongful termination claim based on breach<br>               of  contract that  the  plaintiff had  not proved  such<br>               damages).<br><br>          Since the most that  can be said for Miller is that this issue is<br><br>          an open question under New Hampshire state law, it is not certain<br><br>          that the trial court's  charge, in whatever way it  is construed,<br><br>          was contrary to New Hampshire law.<br><br>                    In   these  circumstances,   we   conclude   that   the<br><br>          controversy over  this potentially disputable issue  of state law<br><br>          has not been properly preserved for decision on this appeal.

CABLETRON'S AND BENSON'S APPEAL<br>                         OF MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\r                         OF MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM<br><br>                    Appellants  Cabletron  and  Benson  ask  this court  to<br><br>          vacate that part of the district court's judgment making an award<br><br>          to  plaintiff  Miller on  his claim  under  state common  law for<br><br>          wrongful  termination.   Appellants  argue that  we should  do so<br><br>          either on the ground that New Hampshire would not permit a common<br><br>          law  claim for  wrongful  discharge or  on  the ground  that  the<br><br>          district court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.<br><br>                    Appellants also ask that we set aside the damages award<br><br>          and  remand the case for a new trial with appropriate guidance to<br><br><br>                                         -47-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the district court on  the scope of damages.  This is in effect a<br><br>          reiteration  of  the argument  that  the  jury should  have  been<br><br>          instructed under  New Hampshire statutory law  rather than common<br><br>          law because,  as  appellants concede,  the  principal  difference<br><br>          between the two  -- at least in the context of this case -- is in<br><br>          the scope of the remedies available.<br><br>                    Alternatively, appellants ask  that this court  certify<br><br>          the determinative  question  of  state  common  law  to  the  New<br><br>          Hampshire Supreme Court.<br><br>                    Appellants contend that  this claim  should never  have<br><br>          been submitted to  the jury because New  Hampshire's human rights<br><br>          laws,  see N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.   354-A,  provides the exclusive\r                 ___<br><br>          remedy  for  a  claim  of  retaliatory  discharge  based  on  sex<br><br>          discrimination.  Appellee Miller responds that appellants did not<br><br>          properly  preserve the issue for  appeal and that,  in any event,<br><br>          the cited statute does not provide an exclusive remedy.<br><br>                    Appellants acknowledge that they never  objected to the<br><br>          court's instruction  to the jury on the question of damages.  The<br><br>          first time appellants gave the trial judge notice of the argument<br><br>          now  advanced on  appeal was  in a  post-judgment motion  seeking<br><br>          various  forms of relief, including vacatur of judgment and a new<br><br>          trial.<br><br>                    Appellants  contend  that  they  raised  the  issue  of<br><br>          statutory   exclusion   of  common   law   remedies   for  gender<br><br>          discrimination  in a  motion for  summary judgment.   Appellants,<br><br>          however, did  not \"squarely and distinctly,\"  see Rivera-G mez v.\r                                                        ___ ____________<br><br><br>                                         -48-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988), raise on the merits\r          _________<br><br>          in their motion for  summary judgment the issue of  the exclusion<br><br>          by statute of a common law wrongful termination remedy for gender<br><br>          discrimination.   Moreover, even if we were to hold that they had<br><br>          done so, still,  in seeking relief from this court  they face the<br><br>          obstacle that they failed to move on this ground,  under Rule 50,<br><br>          for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.  In<br><br>          view of  this failure to bring the matter to the attention of the<br><br>          trial court after the close of the evidence at trial, their claim<br><br>          of error  on this  ground is  not available  for  review under  a<br><br>          standard  as  favorable  to  appellants  as  the  harmless  error<br><br>          standard.    See  Eastern   Mount.  Platform  Tennis  v.  Sherwin\r                       ___  __________________________________      _______<br><br>          Williams, 40 F.3d 492, 497 (1st Cir. 1994).\r          ________<br><br>                    Even if the damages award for Miller's  state law claim<br><br>          was based on  a legal premise  that may not  be the way  this New<br><br>          Hampshire substantive-law  issue is eventually resolved,  at some<br><br>          future time, it does not follow that the judgment based upon that<br><br>          legal premise was a  miscarriage of justice.  The  only prejudice<br><br>          that appellants purport to show was an award of damages for pain,<br><br>          suffering, and mental  anguish that, they argue,  is precluded by<br><br>          the   absence  of   nonpecuniary  damages   from   the  statutory<br><br>          specification of exclusive remedies.  Even were we to accept this<br><br>          assertion, and  hence conclude  that plaintiffs were  not legally<br><br>          entitled to  damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish, the<br><br>          point remains that the record contains evidence of other elements<br><br>          of damages -- evidence more compelling than any evidence of pain,<br><br><br>                                         -49-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          suffering,  and anguish.   Nor  is there  any showing  that pain,<br><br>          suffering, and  anguish were  emphasized by Miller  in presenting<br><br>          his claims  to  the jury.    Finally,  there is  some  doubt,  as<br><br>          explained above, see Part VII, whether the jury could be expected<br><br>          to  understand the charge  as instructing  that they  could award<br><br>          damages  for  pain and  suffering.   At  best, the  suggestion of<br><br>          prejudice is quite speculative.<br><br>                    For these  reasons, we  do not consider  on the  merits<br><br>          appellants'  argument  for vacating  that  part  of the  judgment<br><br>          making an award to  Miller on his claim for  wrongful termination<br><br>          under state common law.  Nor do  we give further consideration to<br><br>          certifying  a question to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire when<br><br>          appellants are procedurally barred from raising on the merits the<br><br>          very issue on which they seek certification.<br><br>                    We also do not  consider whether we should vacate  this<br><br>          part  of the  judgment  on the  ground  that the  district  court<br><br>          improvidently  exercised  supplemental jurisdiction.   Appellants<br><br>          did not  brief this  issue on  appeal, see Brown  v.

DEFENDANT BENSON'S APPEAL OF THE TITLE VII CLAIMS\r               IX.   DEFENDANT BENSON'S APPEAL OF THE TITLE VII CLAIMS<br><br>                    Appellant Benson  asks this  court to vacate  the Title<br><br>          VII  liability findings against him  in favor of  both Scarfo and<br><br><br>                                         -50-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          Miller  and  to determine  that  the district  court  should have<br><br>          dismissed the Title VII claim against him because, as a matter of<br><br>          law, an individual cannot be liable under Title VII.<br><br>                    Benson  squarely  raised this  issue  in  a motion  for<br><br>          summary  judgment  filed  against  plaintiff  Miller.   Appellant<br><br>          Benson concedes that he did not seek summary judgment against the<br><br>          other plaintiff, Scarfo,  on this ground.   He contends,  though,<br><br>          that  the district  judge's  later  consolidation of  plaintiffs'<br><br>          cases and express  order that the defendants'  motion for summary<br><br>          judgment in the Miller case be  transferred to the main case  and<br><br>          considered re-filed  in that case, rendered  the summary judgment<br><br>          motion applicable to plaintiff Scarfo.  We decline to accept this<br><br>          contention.     To  accept  it  would  imply  that  it  would  be<br><br>          appropriate to enter summary judgment  against a party who  never<br><br>          had  explicit notice  that  her opponent  had  moved for  summary<br><br>          judgment   against  her.     Therefore,   we  consider   Benson's<br><br>          contentions  only as  they apply  to his  appeal of  the judgment<br><br>          against him for his retaliatory firing of Miller.<br><br>                    After  the  trial  court  denied  Benson's  motion  for<br><br>          summary judgment  as to  Miller's claim  of individual  Title VII<br><br>          liability,  Benson did  not raise  the issue  again in  the trial<br><br>          court on a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Thus,<br><br>          the claim of error by  the trial court in concluding, as  a basis<br><br>          for   denying  summary   judgment,  that   Miller  may   be  held<br><br>          individually liable is not available for  review under a standard<br><br>          as favorable to appellants  as the harmless error standard.

The<br><br>          trial court instructed the jury that <br><br>                    Under the  Equal Pay Act,  Ms. Scarfo's award<br>                    of unpaid wages is limited to a period of two<br><br>                                         -54-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    years   prior  to  filing  this  lawsuit  and<br>                    extending  until  her termination  unless she<br>                    proves by  a  preponderance of  the  evidence<br>                    that the violation was  willful.  If you find<br>                    that  Cabletron  acted  willfully,  then  Ms.<br>                    Scarfo may  recover unpaid wages for a period<br>                    of  three years prior  to filing this lawsuit<br>                    and extending until her termination.<br><br>          Cf. 29 U.S.C.   155.\r          ___<br><br>                    We  have  no need  to  decide,  and thus  refrain  from<br><br>          deciding,  whether  this  instruction  on the  law  was  accurate<br><br>          because neither party  objected to the  instruction at trial  and<br><br>          neither has raised the issue before this court.<br><br>                    The special verdict form  does not indicate whether the<br><br>          jury found that  the defendant's  violation was  willful.   Thus,<br><br>          assuming,  as  we  must,  that  the  jury  followed  the  court's<br><br>          instructions,  the jury's  award represents  the damages  for the<br><br>          time span from October 8 of either 1988 or  1989 up to January 10<br><br>          of 1991, when plaintiff Scarfo was terminated.<br><br>                    Neither  plaintiff  Scarfo   nor  defendant   Cabletron<br><br>          challenges the jury's award  under the Equal Pay Act  of $28,000.<br><br>          There is a  lack of  clarity in the  briefs and record,  however,<br><br>          about  whether this recovery is  in addition to  the recovery for<br><br>          violation  of Title VII.   We discuss this  issue in Parts XI.A.3<br><br>          and XI.E below.<br><br><br><br>               3.   Combining to a Nonduplicative Total\r               3.   Combining to a Nonduplicative Total<br><br>                    The award under Title VII is to some extent duplicative<br><br>          of the award under the Equal Pay Act.<br><br>                    Apparently  to avoid  a duplicate  recovery, the  trial<br><br>                                         -55-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          court  subtracted the jury's award  of $28,000 for  the Equal Pay<br><br>          Act  violation  committed by  Cabletron  from  the court's  total<br><br>          calculation of $1,215,901.07  (consisting of $242,407.07 in  back<br><br>          pay, $744,744 in front  pay, and $228,750 for the  value of stock<br><br>          options) in  damages  for the  Title VII  violation committed  by<br><br>          Cabletron and  Benson, resulting in what the court determined was<br><br>          the total Title  VII award  of $1,187,901.07  against Benson  and<br><br>          Cabletron.<br><br>                    Thus, under the  final judgment entered in  the case by<br><br>          the  court  below,  defendants  Cabletron and  Benson  were  held<br><br>          jointly and severally liable for  $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII<br><br>          violation and Cabletron was held liable for an additional $28,000<br><br>          for the Equal  Pay Act  violation.  Since  Benson was not  liable<br><br>          under the Equal  Pay Act,  there is a  problem about  subtracting<br><br>          $28,000  from  the  award  against Benson  to  avoid  duplicative<br><br>          recovery.  We address this problem in Part XI.E below, along with<br><br>          the need for other modifications.<br><br>                    Defendants  Cabletron and  Benson raise  arguments with<br><br>          respect to all three components of  Scarfo's Title VII award.  We<br><br>          discuss each component in turn.<br><br><br><br>          B.   Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay\r          B.   Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay<br><br>                    As stated above, the court awarded Scarfo  back pay for<br><br>          the  Title  VII  claim  in  the  amount  of  $242,407.07  (before<br><br>          reduction by $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act award).<br><br>                    Title VII  permits an  award of back  pay starting  two<br><br><br>                                         -56-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          years before the date of the filing of plaintiff's complaint with<br><br>          the EEOC  (two years before March  6, 1991) up until  the date of<br><br>          judgment.   42  U.S.C.    2000-5(g).   Thus, plaintiff  Scarfo is<br><br>          entitled to back pay  from March 6, 1989  to May 10, 1994.   From<br><br>          March 6, 1989  to the date of her termination,  January 10, 1991,<br><br>          the damages represent the  amount that she was underpaid  because<br><br>          of discrimination on the basis of her sex.  From January 10, 1991<br><br>          to May 10,  1994, damages  represent the amount  she should  have<br><br>          been paid,  if she had  not been terminated  on the basis  of her<br><br>          sex.<br><br>                    The court  performed  a detailed  set  of  calculations<br><br>          based  on   evidence  admitted   at  trial  and   awarded  Scarfo<br><br>          $242,407.07 in back pay  (before reduction to avoid duplication).<br><br>          See Addendum to Court's Order of May 9, 1994.  These calculations\r          ___<br><br>          separate  the time  period for  back pay  into the  relevant sub-<br><br>          periods  and use the salary  rate of an  arguably equivalent male<br><br>          employee  (as a proxy for what plaintiff Scarfo would have earned<br><br>          in the  absence of discrimination)  to calculate the  damages for<br><br>          each day  of each sub-period.  Although  defendants raise several<br><br>          arguments with  respect to these calculations,  we determine that<br><br>          the  court's findings of fact are not \"clearly erroneous\" and the<br><br>          method  of performing  the  calculations was  in accordance  with<br><br>          applicable law.<br><br>                    In  particular,  the  defendants  criticize  the  trial<br><br>          court's use of the salaries of two other Cabletron employees, Mr.<br><br>          O'Connor  and Mr. Jacob,  in the calculations.   Defendants argue<br><br><br>                                         -57-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          that the trial court erred in comparing plaintiff Scarfo to these<br><br>          two   employees  because   these   two   employees  had   greater<br><br>          responsibilities at  Cabletron.  This argument  fails because the<br><br>          trial court  reasonably could have determined  that Scarfo either<br><br>          had  a similar level of  responsibility or would  have been given<br><br>          similar responsibilities but for discrimination.<br><br>                    The  court calculated  damages  up until  May 4,  1994,<br><br>          only, instead of May 10, 1994.  No party, however, has raised any<br><br>          issue on appeal regarding this  period of approximately one week,<br><br>          and  we do  not disturb  the trial  court's calculations  in this<br><br>          respect.<br><br><br><br>          C.  Scarfo's Front Pay Award\r          C.  Scarfo's Front Pay Award<br><br>                    The court awarded Scarfo  $744,744 as front pay.   In a<br><br>          Title  VII case, the court has discretion to award front pay from<br><br>          the date of judgment  forward when reinstatement is impracticable<br><br>          or impossible.<br><br>                    See Goss v.

In<br><br>          light of the evidence that  she had only a ten percent  chance of<br><br>          returning to full employment at an equivalent salary, the court's<br><br>          finding  that   Scarfo  will  be  unable   to  find  professional<br><br>          employment in the future is not clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    Defendants  also argue  that  the  \"court imported  the<br><br>          erroneous  concept of displaced worker into the case.\"  The court<br><br>          did  not explain the meaning  of \"displaced worker,\"  nor has our<br><br>          attention been  called to  any published  opinion that  uses this<br><br>          terminology in the Title  VII context.  In any  event, regardless<br><br>          of  the  terminology used,  plaintiff  Scarfo's  ability to  find<br><br>          similar  employment in the future  is relevant both  to the trial<br><br>          court's decision to  award front  pay and to  the calculation  of<br><br>          such an award.  The  trial court did not abuse its  discretion in<br><br>          awarding front pay to the plaintiff.<br><br>                    In calculating  Scarfo's  front pay  award,  the  court<br><br>          adopted  the   calculations   of  plaintiff's   expert   witness.<br><br><br>                                         -59-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          Defendants do not dispute that these calculations were admissible<br><br>          and  were  adequately  explained   by  the  expert's  report  and<br><br>          testimony; rather, they now question merely the weight  the court<br><br>          gave to this  evidence by  pointing out concessions  made by  the<br><br>          expert during the cross-examination.  The defendants' contentions<br><br>          fail  because  the choice  by the  court,  as factfinder  for the<br><br>          purpose of calculating damages,  to give probative weight  to the<br><br>          expert's calculations was not clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    In another respect, however, we conclude that the court<br><br>          erred  in adopting  and  using  the  expert's calculations  as  a<br><br>          measure of front pay.  The expert's calculation of damages in the<br><br>          amount of  $973,494, which the  court adopted for  Scarfo's front<br><br>          pay award,  was for a period  commencing on January 1,  1991.  As<br><br>          stated above, \"front pay\"  usually refers to an award  for future<br><br>          salary payments starting  on the  date of the  judgment, in  this<br><br>          case, May  10, 1994.  Since  the court, in addition  to its front<br><br>          pay award, also awarded back pay for the time period up until the<br><br>          date of the  verdict on  May 4, 1994,  plaintiff Scarfo  obtained<br><br>          duplicate damages for  the period from January 1, 1991  to May 4,<br><br>          1994.<br><br>                    \"[T]he law  abhors duplicative recoveries.   That is to<br><br>          say,  a plaintiff  who  is injured  by  reason of  a  defendant's<br><br>          behavior is,  for the most part, entitled to be made whole -- not<br><br>          to be enriched.\"  Dopp v. HTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 516 (1st  Cir.\r                            ____    _________<br><br>          1991).  The court adopted the expert's calculations for the front<br><br>          pay award  and performed  its own calculations  to determine  the<br><br><br>                                         -60-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          back pay award.   Thus, the amounts of the front pay and back pay<br><br>          awards  representing the period from  January 1, 1991  to May 10,<br><br>          1994  are different  because  the expert  and the  court employed<br><br>          different  methods to  calculate damages.   To  avoid duplicative<br><br>          recovery, plaintiff Scarfo's combined  total of Title VII damages<br><br>          should be reduced either by the amount the court  awarded as back<br><br>          pay for the  period from January 1, 1991  to May 10, 1994,  or by<br><br>          the amount the court ordered as front pay for that same period.<br><br>                    For  two  reasons  we   choose  the  latter  method  of<br><br>          determining the measure of the duplication that must be  avoided.<br><br>          First,  unlike  the court's  calculations  for  that period,  the<br><br>          expert's calculations  include social security  contributions and<br><br>          fringe benefits.  Therefore, the amount derived from the expert's<br><br>          calculations is a larger amount than the amount calculated by the<br><br>          court for that period.  Thus, it is more consistent with our goal<br><br>          of modification only as  needed to avoid duplicative  recovery to<br><br>          decrease  the  total award  by the  smaller  amount, that  is the<br><br>          amount  the  court  calculated  for back  pay  for  that  period.<br><br>          Second,  since  the expert's  calculations  were  computed on  an<br><br>          annual  basis and  the court's  calculations were  computed on  a<br><br>          daily basis, using the  back pay measure calculated by  the court<br><br>          for the period from January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994 makes for an<br><br>          easier and more precise calculation of the duplication.<br><br>                    As stated above,  the trial court calculated  plaintiff<br><br>          Scarfo's Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07 (before adjustment<br><br>          for  the Equal Pay Act  award) consisting of  $242,407.07 in back<br><br><br>                                         -61-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          pay, $744,744 in  front pay, and $228,750 for  the value of stock<br><br>          options.   The portion of the court's back pay award attributable<br><br>          to the period for January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 is $224,013.12.<br><br>          Thus, to avoid  duplication, we reduce the court's calculation of<br><br>          Title VII damages by  $224,013.12, resulting in a back  pay award<br><br>          of $18,393.95  ($242,407.07 less $224,013.12), and a total sum of<br><br>          Title VII  damages (before  adjustment with respect  to Cabletron<br><br>          for  the  Equal Pay  Act  award)  of  $991,887.95, consisting  of<br><br>          $18,393.95  for the period up  to January 10,  1991, $744,744 for<br><br>          the period  commencing January  10,  1991, and  $228,750 for  the<br><br>          value of stock options.  Both defendants Cabletron and Benson are<br><br>          jointly and severally liable  for this amount.  This  amount does<br><br>          not include the adjustment (discussed below in Part XI.E) for the<br><br>          jury's Equal Pay Act award against Cabletron only.<br><br><br><br>          D.   Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options\r          D.   Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options<br><br>                    The court  awarded damages to plaintiff  Scarfo for the<br><br>          value  of stock  options she would  have received if  she had not<br><br>          been discriminated against on the basis  of sex.  The court found<br><br>          that Scarfo would have been given options to purchase 2500 shares<br><br>          of stock at a purchase price of $15.50.  The court found that the<br><br>          value  of the stock was $107.00 per  share around the time of the<br><br>          trial  and  awarded Scarfo  $228,750  in  damages ($107.00  minus<br><br>          $15.50 times 2,500).<br><br>                    Defendants raise only one argument with respect to this<br><br>          damages award;  they say  that Scarfo is  barred from  recovering<br><br><br>                                         -62-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          these damages on the  basis of res  judicata.  Before filing  the<br><br>          civil  action in federal court,  Scarfo filed an  action with the<br><br>          New Hampshire Department of Labor.  In that action, the plaintiff<br><br>          sought  to  recover compensation  under  N.H. Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  <br><br>          275:51.<br><br>                    See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   275:51 (authorizing the\r                    ___<br>               Commissioner of the  New Hampshire Department of  Labor<br>               to hold  hearings to enforce the  provisions of certain<br>               New Hampshire labor laws).<br><br>          The  Department  of  Labor  determined, inter  alia,  that  stock\r                                                  _____  ____<br><br>          options were  not \"compensation\"  and thus not  recoverable under<br><br>          N.H.

The district judge dismissed the  breach of<br><br>          contract claim on the basis of res judicata because it stated the<br><br>          same cause of action the  plaintiff had already adjudicated under<br><br>          N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   275:51.<br><br>                    Defendants assert that because the plaintiff was barred<br><br>          from recovering  damages  for stock  options  under a  breach  of<br><br>          contract theory,  the plaintiff should be  barred from recovering<br><br>          damages for stock  options under a  Title VII sex  discrimination<br><br>          theory.  This argument lacks merit.  Under defendants' reasoning,<br><br>          the  plaintiff would be barred  from recovering any  type of lost<br><br>          compensation (including  wages) under Title VII,  because she had<br><br>          adjudicated a breach of  contract claim for lost wages  and other<br><br>          compensation in  the Department of  Labor proceedings.   But  res<br><br>          judicata bars causes  of action, not types of damages recoverable<br><br>                                         -63-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          under  some  other  claim  not  subject  to  adjudication  in the<br><br>          tribunal rendering the judgment.<br><br>                    See In Re Alfred P., 126 N.H. 628, 629 (1985)(\"The\r                    ___ _______________<br>               doctrine of res judicata  precludes the litigation in a<br>               later  case of matters  actually litigated, and matters<br>               that could  have been  litigated, in an  earlier action<br>               between  the  same  parties   for  the  same  cause  of<br>               action.\").<br><br>          Plaintiff's Title VII cause  of action is  not the same cause  of<br><br>          action as  her breach of  contract action; it  requires different<br><br>          elements  to be proved.  These different elements were not tried,<br><br>          and could not have been tried, in the New Hampshire Department of<br><br>          Labor  hearings.  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII claim is not<br><br>          barred by res judicata.<br><br>                    Since  the defendants  raise  no  other arguments  with<br><br>          respect to the  trial court's award of $228,750 for  the value of<br><br>          stock options not received by plaintiff Scarfo, we do not disturb<br><br>          the trial court's award.<br><br><br><br>          E.   Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award\r          E.   Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award<br><br>                    As   described  above,   the  trial   court  originally<br><br>          calculated  Title  VII  damages   to  be  $1,215,901.07.    Then,<br><br>          recognizing  the need  to avoid  duplicative recovery,  the court<br><br>          subtracted $28,000 for the Equal Pay  Act claim.  Thus, under the<br><br>          final  judgment  entered  by  the  court  (as  gleaned  from  the<br><br>          collection of Orders referred to in Part II, supra) Cabletron was\r                                                       _____<br><br>          held liable  for $1,187,901.07  for the  Title VII  violation and<br><br>          $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.<br><br>                    Defendants argue  that the  court erred  in subtracting<br><br>                                         -64-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the Equal  Pay  Act award  from  the back  pay  component of  the<br><br>          court's Title  VII award.  We  agree that the method  used by the<br><br>          trial court to avoid duplicate recoveries was at  best confusing,<br><br>          if not erroneous, for two reasons.  First, the back pay component<br><br>          of the Title VII damages award and the jury's Equal Pay Act award<br><br>          represent  damages  for different  time  periods.   Second,  only<br><br>          defendant Cabletron  (and not  defendant Benson) is  liable under<br><br>          the  Equal Pay  Act.   Thus,  we  make the  following  additional<br><br>          adjustment.<br><br>                    In Part XI.C above, our modification of the total Title<br><br>          VII damages resulted in a calculation of Title VII damages in the<br><br>          amount of $991,887.95.   The remaining question before us  is how<br><br>          appropriately to modify this  award to avoid duplicative recovery<br><br>          by plaintiff Scarfo.<br><br>                    The  portion   of  our   modified  Title   VII  damages<br><br>          calculation representing damages from March 6, 1989 to January 1,<br><br>          1991 is  $18,393.95.  The  jury's Equal Pay Act  award of $28,000<br><br>          represents damages for the  same injury, namely discrimination in<br><br>          pay on the  basis of sex, for a period  commencing either October<br><br>          8, 1988 or October 8, 1989 and extending to January 10, 1991, the<br><br>          date  of her termination.   Thus, regardless of  whether the jury<br><br>          found willfulness, these time periods overlap to some extent.<br><br>                    We consider separately the two cases (the two different<br><br>          periods, and as a result the two different methods of calculation<br><br>          to avoid an overlap).<br><br>                    If  the jury found wilfulness, the EPA award of $28,000<br><br><br>                                         -65-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          represents the period from  October 8, 1988 to January  10, 1991.<br><br>          This time period is  longer than, and includes entirely  the time<br><br>          period  of March 6,  1989 to January  1, 1991,  for which damages<br><br>          were  calculated  at   $18,393.95.    Thus,  if  the  jury  found<br><br>          wilfulness, the appropriate way  to avoid duplicative recovery is<br><br>          to  reduce the  Equal  Pay  Act  award  by  $18,393.95,  so  that<br><br>          Cabletron is liable to  plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95  for the<br><br>          Title VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay<br><br>          Act violation.<br><br>                    If  the jury did not find wilfulness, the Equal Pay Act<br><br>          award  of $28,000 represents the  period from October  8, 1989 to<br><br>          January 10,  1991.  This is  a shorter time period  than the time<br><br>          period from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 for  which the judge<br><br>          awarded $18,393.95.  If we could determine that  the jury did not<br><br>          find wilfulness,  the more accurate  adjustment we could  make to<br><br>          avoid duplicative recovery would  be to reduce the Equal  Pay Act<br><br>          award  by  $12,367.55,   the  amount  of  the  Title   VII  award<br><br>          representing damages from October 8, 1989 to January 1, 1991.<br><br>                    Since  we  cannot  determine  whether  the  jury  found<br><br>          wilfulness,  we   conclude  that  it  is   appropriate  in  these<br><br>          circumstances  to  accept  the  reduction  of  $18,393.95  as  an<br><br>          appropriate adjustment to avoid overlap (instead of the reduction<br><br>          of $12,367.55).  If, in fact, the jury's award was not based on a<br><br>          finding of wilfulness and accordingly  the appropriate adjustment<br><br>          is a reduction  of $12,367.55,  then the  prejudice to  plaintiff<br><br>          Scarfo is quite small (i.e., $6,026.40) in comparison either with<br><br><br>                                         -66-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          her  total  recovery or  with  the cost  to  her, as  well  as to<br><br>          opposing parties and the public,  of a remand for a new  trial on<br><br>          the sole issue of whether Cabletron's Equal Pay Act violation was<br><br>          wilful.   Having failed to request an explicit jury finding as to<br><br>          wilfulness,  Scarfo  is  in  no  position  to  complain  of  this<br><br>          resolution of the issue.<br><br>                    Thus,  after  the  reduction  of  $18,393.95  to  avoid<br><br>          overlap, Cabletron is liable  to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95<br><br>          for the Title VII  violation and an additional $9,606.05  for the<br><br>          Equal Pay Act violation.<br><br>                    Since the Equal  Pay Act claim was  not brought against<br><br>          defendant Benson,  Benson is liable  only for Title  VII damages.<br><br>          In  accordance with the explanation  above, Benson is jointly and<br><br>          severally  liable  to  Scarfo  for  Title  VII  damage  totalling<br><br>          $991,887.95  consisting  of  $18,393.95  for  the  period  before<br><br>          January 10, 1991; $744,744 for the period after January 10, 1991;<br><br>          and $228,750 in stock options.<br><br>                    We  emphasize that these  adjusted calculations are not<br><br>          intended to alter the usual terminology and relevant time periods<br><br>          for  damages under Title VII.   As explained  above, a successful<br><br>          plaintiff  (one who  has  proved liability  under  Title VII)  is<br><br>          entitled to back  pay for a Title  VII violation starting on  the<br><br>          date two years before the plaintiff's EEOC  filing and continuing<br><br>          until the date of judgment.  A court, in its discretion, may also<br><br>          award front pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date of<br><br>          judgment and continuing to some specified date in the future.<br><br><br>                                         -67-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                          XII.   PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES\r                          XII.   PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES<br><br>                    The jury  found defendants Cabletron and  Benson liable<br><br>          to plaintiff  Miller under  Title VII for  retaliatory discharge.<br><br>          The  court  awarded  plaintiff  Miller $190,651.85  in  back  pay<br><br>          representing lost compensation from the date of  his discharge to<br><br>          the date of judgment.  The court awarded Miller $995,000 in front<br><br>          pay purportedly  representing lost compensation from  the date of<br><br>          judgment forward.  The court also awarded Miller $206,060 for the<br><br>          value of stock  options that he  did not receive  because of  his<br><br>          discharge.    These  three  calculations total  $1,391,711.85  in<br><br>          damages for the Title VII violation.<br><br>                    The defendants  raise no arguments with  respect to the<br><br>          court's back pay award  of $190,651.85.  We discuss, in turn, the<br><br>          defendants  arguments with respect  to the front  pay damages and<br><br>          the damages for the value of the stock options.<br><br><br><br>          A.   Miller's Damages for Front Pay\r          A.   Miller's Damages for Front Pay<br><br>                    Defendants argue that the court's method of calculating<br><br>          damages  for front  pay was  an abuse  of discretion.   The  jury<br><br>          awarded   plaintiff  Miller  $995,000  in  damages  for  Miller's<br><br>          wrongful  discharge claim  under  New Hampshire  state law.   The<br><br>          court, for a reason not stated, assumed that this sum represented<br><br>          damages  for front pay only.   Thus, the  court incorporated this<br><br>          sum  of  $995,000  into the  court's  calculations  of  Title VII<br><br>          damages as the damages for front pay.<br><br>                    As  stated above, we review a court's decision to award<br><br><br>                                         -68-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          front  pay damages  under the  abuse-of-discretion standard.   We<br><br>          conclude that  the defendants are  correct in asserting  that the<br><br>          court's decision to use  the jury's figure of $995,000  for front<br><br>          pay damages was an  abuse of discretion because the  jury's award<br><br>          may have included some back pay, some amount for the value of the<br><br>          stock options, and some amount as damages for pain and suffering.<br><br>          Plaintiff  Miller, in  a post-trial  motion and  in his  brief as<br><br>          appellee, agrees that the court erred in this respect.<br><br>                    The  jury was  instructed  that if  it found  Cabletron<br><br>          liable   on  the state  law wrongful  termination claim,  it must<br><br>          consider two types of damages:<br><br>                    First, you must determine the amount of wages<br>                    and  fringe  benefits  he  would  have earned<br>                    through  employment with  defendant Cabletron<br>                    . . . if  he had  not been discharged  on May<br>                    30th,  1990,  to  the date  of  your verdict.<br>                    Second,  you must  determine  the  amount  of<br>                    future   wages   and   fringe   benefits   he<br>                    reasonably   would   have   earned   in   his<br>                    employment with Cabletron if  he had not been<br>                    discharged.<br><br>          This instruction clearly  permits the jury to award both back-pay<br><br>          damages  and front-pay damages.  The verdict form did not require<br><br>          the jury to report the  two separately.  The $995,000 awarded  by<br><br>          the  jury is reasonably interpreted as an award for both back pay<br><br>          and  front  pay.   As  explained  above,  the  $995,000 may  have<br><br>          included,  also, damages for pain and suffering.  Thus, the court<br><br>          erred  in  using  the jury's  award  on  the  state law  wrongful<br><br>          termination claim as the measure of front pay damages under Title<br><br>          VII.<br><br>                    At  trial, plaintiff  Miller's  expert  testified  that<br><br>                                         -69-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          $211,000  was  the  appropriate   award  for  front-pay  damages.<br><br>          Plaintiff Miller  has asked  this court,  in correcting  for this<br><br>          error, to reduce the award for front-pay damages from $995,000 to<br><br>          $211,000, the  amount  calculated by  plaintiff Miller's  expert.<br><br>          Defendants  Cabletron and  Benson  argue that  this court  should<br><br>          vacate the entire  award for  front pay because  the trial  court<br><br>          abused its discretion  in deciding  to make any  award for  front<br><br>          pay.<br><br>                    The court  below found that Miller  did make reasonable<br><br>          efforts to  procure employment, but that the  courier business he<br><br>          began in  1991 has not  yet made a  profit.  We  will not disturb<br><br>          this finding of fact because the defendants have not shown it  to<br><br>          be clearly erroneous.  From this finding, we infer that the court<br><br>          also  found that  it was  impracticable for  Miller to  return to<br><br>          Cabletron and that Miller  had made reasonable efforts to  find a<br><br>          job with the  same earning capacity.  Miller is  thus entitled to<br><br>          damages for front pay.  The court's determination that Miller was<br><br>          entitled to an award of front pay was not an abuse of discretion,<br><br>          and we will not disturb that determination.<br><br>                    Plaintiff's proposal  to this  court that the  award be<br><br>          reduced from $995,000  to $211,000  -- if the  proposal had  been<br><br>          made  to and  accepted  by the  trial  court --  has  evidentiary<br><br>          support in the testimony of plaintiff's expert.<br><br>                    This court has authority to modify a damages award when<br><br>          all the necessary factfindings have been made in the court below.<br><br>          Cf.  Lipsett, 975  F.2d at  943 (modifying an  award of  fair and\r          ___  _______<br><br><br>                                         -70-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          reasonable attorneys'  fees when  the  trial court  made a  legal<br><br>          error with respect to  the method of calculation).   Reducing the<br><br>          award to  $211,000, however, as plaintiff  Miller requests, would<br><br>          require this court to evaluate the credibility of the plaintiff's<br><br>          expert and  to make a new finding of  fact, not made in the trial<br><br>          court, that Miller is  entitled to $211,000 in damages  for front<br><br>          pay.<br><br>                    Since  we do not have the authority to make findings of<br><br>          fact  in order  to modify the  award in  the manner  requested by<br><br>          plaintiff, we vacate the front pay award.<br><br>                    We  remand this  case  to the  district  court for  the<br><br>          limited  purpose of  determining  an appropriate  amount for  the<br><br>          front pay award.   The district court, on  remand, may allow  the<br><br>          interested parties a reasonable time period within  which to file<br><br>          with the district court  a stipulation resolving this issue  (for<br><br>          example, a stipulation  such as Miller's  proposal to this  court<br><br>          that his award for front pay be reduced to  $211,000 and judgment<br><br>          be  entered accordingly).   If  no such  agreement is  filed, the<br><br>          trial court is to determine the amount of the award to Miller for<br><br>          front pay.  The trial court may find it appropriate to act on the<br><br>          present record of evidence  and adopt the plaintiff's calculation<br><br>          of $211,000 for  front pay.  It  may instead calculate front  pay<br><br>          damages from the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) forward in  some<br><br>          other  manner supported by the present record of evidence.  Also,<br><br>          the court, in  its discretion  and for cause  shown, may  receive<br><br>          additional evidence bearing upon this issue.<br><br><br>                                         -71-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          B.   Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options\r          B.   Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options<br><br>                    During his employment, plaintiff  Miller was told that,<br><br>          over a specific period of  time, he would be given stock  options<br><br>          that  would allow  him to  purchase 10,000 shares  of stock  at a<br><br>          purchase price of  $3.97 per  share.  During  his employment,  he<br><br>          received  options to purchase only 2,000 shares.  During the time<br><br>          period from the date of  his termination (April 20, 1990)  to the<br><br>          date of judgment (May 10, 1994) Miller alleges that he would have<br><br>          received options to  purchase 5,000 shares.   Miller also alleges<br><br>          that within a month of the date of judgment, his right to options<br><br>          with respect  to the  remaining 3,000  shares would  have vested.<br><br>          Thus,  Miller's counsel  argued  to the  trial court  that Miller<br><br>          should have been  awarded damages  for the value  of options  for<br><br>          8,000 shares of stock.<br><br>                    The court awarded plaintiff  Miller $206,060 in damages<br><br>          for the  value of  2,000  shares of  stock.   The  court did  not<br><br>          explain how  it determined the  number 2,000 to be  the number of<br><br>          shares of stock.<br><br>                    Defendants-appellants, in their brief on appeal, do not<br><br>          dispute the facts, as alleged  by plaintiff Miller, regarding the<br><br>          options  for  10,000 shares.    In  an effort  to  point out  all<br><br>          potential errors made by  the district court in support  of their<br><br>          argument that this court should vacate both awards entirely, they<br><br>          argue that the trial  court erred in deciding to award Miller the<br><br>          value  of 2,000 stock options.  Defendants suggest that the trial\r                    _____<br><br>          court mistakenly  thought that Miller had  already received stock\r                                                             ________<br><br><br>                                         -72-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          options for 8,000  of the 10,000 shares, when,  in fact, this was<br><br>          the amount he had not received because of his termination.\r                            ___ ________<br><br>                    The  brief of  appellee  Miller agrees  that the  court<br><br>          erred, and suggests (adopting defendants' reasoning in part) that<br><br>          the  court  should  have  awarded $824,240,  the  value  of stock<br><br>          options for 8,000 shares.<br><br>                    The implications  of defendants' argument on appeal are<br><br>          troubling.  They  have requested,  in the event  that this  court<br><br>          does not  reverse the  liability determination on  Miller's Title<br><br>          VII claim,  that this  court  set aside  Miller's entire  damages<br><br>          award  and remand.   If the remand  were limited to  trial of the<br><br>          issue of damages for the value of stock, however, the trial court<br><br>          might award either the value of 5,000 shares of stock (the amount<br><br>          vesting  before  the date  of judgment),  or  the value  of 8,000<br><br>          shares of stock.   In  either case, the  probable consequence  of<br><br>          retrying only this issue would be an additional liability, beyond<br><br>          that  already awarded by the  trial court, of  either $309,090 or<br><br>          $618,180 in favor of plaintiff Miller.<br><br>                    Miller's  brief as  appellee  requests that  this court\r                                                                 ____<br><br>          award  damages for the value  of stock options  for 8,000 shares.<br><br>          Defendants  respond that we should not  grant this request (which<br><br>          would increase the total  damages award) because plaintiff Miller<br><br>          did  not appeal the award of damages in his cross-appeal; rather,<br><br>          plaintiff Miller  raised this argument only in its appellee brief<br><br>          responding to the defendants' appeal.<br><br>                    We  refrain from  modifying the  judgment to  award the<br><br><br>                                         -73-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          value of 8,000 stock options because to do so would require  this<br><br>          court  to  make  new findings  of  fact.   We  also  refrain from<br><br>          remanding this issue to  the trial court for the  limited purpose<br><br>          of determining an appropriate  award for the value of  lost stock<br><br>          options because neither party has requested  that we do so.  Both<br><br>          parties have  requested that  this court  take  actions that  are<br><br>          beyond this  court's authority.   Since neither  party's position<br><br>          has merit, we simply  affirm the trial court's award  of $206,060<br><br>          for the value of stock options for 2,000 shares of stock.<br><br>                             XIII.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST\r                             XIII.  PREJUDGMENT INTEREST<br><br>          A.  The Arguments of the Parties\r          A.  The Arguments of the Parties<br><br>                    There is some confusion  both in the record and  in the<br><br>          parties' briefs  about  whether  the  court  awarded  prejudgment<br><br>          interest  on  any  part  of Scarfo's  damages  award  and whether<br><br>          prejudgment interest,  if awarded,  was appropriate.   Defendants<br><br>          argue  that the  court awarded  prejudgment interest  on Scarfo's<br><br>          Title  VII  award, and  that this  was  error.   Plaintiff Scarfo<br><br>          argues that the trial court refused to award prejudgment interest<br><br>          on Scarfo's Title VII award.<br><br>                    We  conclude from a review of the record that the trial<br><br>          court  denied prejudgment interest on every  element of the award<br><br>          to plaintiff Scarfo.   In  answer to  Question 6  of the  verdict<br><br>          form, the  jury  answered \"NO,\"  finding  against Scarfo  on  her<br><br>          prejudgment  interest claim.  By its Order  of July 20, 1994, the<br><br>          court stated as to all of  Scarfo's claims, \"Prejudgment interest<br><br>          is disallowed.\"<br><br><br>                                         -74-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    With respect to the  judgment for plaintiff Miller, the<br><br>          defendants have not raised  on appeal any objection to  the trial<br><br>          court's  award  of prejudgment  interest  on  Miller's state  law<br><br>          wrongful  termination  claim at  the rate  of  10% per  annum, as<br><br>          mandated  by N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    524:1-b and    336:1.  With<br><br>          respect  to Miller's  Title  VII award,  however,  there is  some<br><br>          confusion  in  the  parties'  briefs about  whether  the  parties<br><br>          understood  that the  court awarded  prejudgment interest  on any<br><br>          part of the award.   The parties' briefs assume  that prejudgment<br><br>          interest was awarded  on the entire Title  VII award.   From this<br><br>          premise, the parties  dispute whether it was  appropriate for the<br><br>          court  to award prejudgment interest  on the front  pay award and<br><br>          the  portion of the back  pay award representing  damages for the<br><br>          period from the date Miller's complaint was filed  to the date of<br><br>          judgment.<br><br>                    We  conclude from a review of the record that the trial<br><br>          court allowed  prejudgment interest  on Miller's state  law claim<br><br>          for wrongful  termination, but not on any aspect of his Title VII<br><br>          claim.  In its answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury<br><br>          answered  \"NO,\" thus  finding  against Miller  on  his claim  for<br><br>          prejudgment interest.   But  in his Order  of July 19,  1994, the<br><br>          trial  judge \"abrogate[d]\" that finding  insofar as it applied to<br><br>          the state law claim for  wrongful termination and awarded  Miller<br><br>          prejudgment  interest from the date of filing of the complaint to<br><br>          the date of the verdict.<br><br>                    Since, contrary  to the contentions of  the parties, we<br><br><br>                                         -75-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          have  concluded that  the trial court  did not  award prejudgment<br><br>          interest on  plaintiff Scarfo's and plaintiff  Miller's Title VII<br><br>          awards, the  only question remaining  is whether the  trial court<br><br>          erred  by  denying prejudgment  interest  on all  aspects  of the<br><br>          plaintiffs' Title VII awards.<br><br>                    A   trial  court   has  discretion  whether   to  award<br><br>          prejudgment interest on a successful Title VII claim.<br><br>                    See Earnhardt v.  Puerto Rico, 744 F.2d 1,  3 (1st\r                    ___ _________     ___________<br>               Cir. 1984)(in a Title VII case the question of \"whether<br>               [prejudgment  interest   is]  necessary  to   make  the<br>               plaintiff   whole  is  within  the  discretion  of  the<br>               district court\").<br><br>          In view of the discretion allowed the  trial court as to interest<br><br>          on a Title  VII award, we conclude, in  the circumstances of this<br><br>          case,  that the  trial  court did  not  abuse its  discretion  in<br><br>          declining to award prejudgment interest  on the Title VII  award.<br><br>          Thus,  as stated  below in  the Conclusion,  we affirm  the trial<br><br>          court's  decision  not  to  award prejudgment  interest  on  both<br><br>          plaintiffs' Title VII claims.<br><br><br><br>          B.   Front Pay Awards\r          B.   Front Pay Awards<br><br>                    For an  additional reason, we affirm  the trial court's<br><br>          denial of  prejudgment interest on  the front  pay components  of<br><br>          both  plaintiffs'   Title  VII  damages  awards.     Interest  is<br><br>          ordinarily awarded  to  compensate for  the  lost use  of  funds.<br><br>          Since  the  front  pay awards  represent  damages  for  wages the<br><br>          plaintiffs would have received  in the future, after the  date of<br><br>          judgment, the plaintiffs had  not lost use of these  funds before<br><br><br>                                         -76-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the judgment was ordered.<br><br>                    Cf.  Conway v.  Electro Switch  Corp., 523  N.E.2d\r                    ___  ______     _____________________<br>               255,  258-59 (Mass.  1988)(prejudgment interest  is not<br>               available under Massachusetts  law for awards of  front<br>               pay   for   violations   of   a   Massachusetts   anti-<br>               discrimination statute).<br><br>          Moreover,  the plaintiffs'  experts,  in calculating  damages for<br><br>          front pay,  correctly chose to discount  the amounts representing<br><br>          the plaintiffs' future wages  at an appropriate interest  rate in<br><br>          order  to determine  the present  value of  the future  stream of<br><br>          income to which each plaintiff would have been entitled.<br><br>                    Thus, as stated in the Conclusion below, we affirm  the<br><br>          trial court's  denial of  prejudgment interest  on the  front pay<br><br>          components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.<br><br><br><br>          C.   Awards for the Value of Stock Options\r          C.   Awards for the Value of Stock Options<br><br>                    In  this   case,  defendants  argue   that  prejudgment<br><br>          interest should not be awarded on the value of the stock options,<br><br>          since the amount of damages  was based on the price of  the stock<br><br>          on or near the date of  judgment.  If the plaintiffs had received<br><br>          the stock options  at the time due and had  not transferred them,<br><br>          the plaintiffs would have  been in possession of shares  of stock<br><br>          having the value equal to the  purchase price plus the amount  of<br><br>          damages.   Thus, the damages awards for the stock options already<br><br>          represent the present  value of the stock options  at the date of<br><br>          judgment.  We conclude  that an award of prejudgment  interest is<br><br>          not  necessary   to  compensate  the  plaintiffs.     Although  a<br><br>          reasonable argument may  be made that prejudgment interest  is an<br><br><br>                                         -77-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          appropriate remedy for the loss of dividends that would have been<br><br>          paid to plaintiffs if  they had been in  possession of the  stock<br><br>          during  the period  to which  they were  entitled to  it, neither<br><br>          party has argued  this proposition.   Since both plaintiffs  have<br><br>          conceded either  explicitly (in Miller's case)  or implicitly (in<br><br>          Scarfo's case, to the extent she argues that prejudgment interest<br><br>          was not even awarded)  that prejudgment interest on the  value of<br><br>          the  stock options is not appropriate, we refrain from addressing<br><br>          the  argument  that  prejudgment   interest  may  be  awarded  as<br><br>          compensation for lost dividends.<br><br>                    Thus, defendants and plaintiffs agree  that prejudgment<br><br>          interest  was inappropriate on the damages  for stock options and<br><br>          we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the<br><br>          stock options components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.<br><br><br><br>                       XIV.   MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS\r                       XIV.   MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS<br><br>                    The  orders   of  the  district  court   that  we  have<br><br>          determined to  be the functional  equivalent of a  final judgment<br><br>          are  silent,  and thus  perhaps  ambiguous, with  respect  to the<br><br>          effect of the  overlap between the judgment  for plaintiff Miller<br><br>          on  the jury  finding  of  damages  in  the  state  law  wrongful<br><br>          termination claim and  the judgment for  plaintiff Miller in  the<br><br>          court's findings of  damages in  the Title VII  claim.   Separate<br><br>          awards  were made  for these  two claims,  but nothing  is stated<br><br>          explicitly about whether and to what extent, and with what effect<br><br>          on collectibility,  the elements  of harm for  which damages  are<br><br><br>                                         -78-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          awarded under the two claims overlap.<br><br>                    None  of  the  parties   brought  this  matter  to  the<br><br>          attention of the trial court.

Appellants do challenge, however, the<br><br>          size of each award of attorneys'  fees on the ground that it does<br><br>          not account for plaintiff's failure to win at trial on all claims<br><br>          originally made.<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo   prevailed  on  her   claim  against<br><br>          Cabletron  and  Benson for  sex discrimination  and on  her claim<br><br>          against  Cabletron under the Equal Pay  Act.

Her claim  of breach of  contract was<br><br>          dismissed  on the ground of  res judicata.   The defamation claim<br><br>          was not pressed at trial, apparently because it was settled.<br><br>                    Miller prevailed against  Cabletron and  Benson on  his<br><br>          Title VII claim for  retaliatory discharge, and against Cabletron<br><br>          on  his state-law wrongful  termination claim.

The court awarded fees to<br><br>          Scarfo in the  amounts of  $225,300.13 for services  of the  firm<br><br>          that handled the bulk of her case and $18,955 for the services of<br><br>          a firm that  handled a small part of the case.  The court awarded<br><br>          fees to Miller in the amount of $117,510.97.<br><br>                    Appellants  assert  that  the  trial  court  improperly<br><br>          awarded Miller fees related to claims on which he did not prevail<br><br>          at trial -- apparently, the dismissed  claims of abuse of process<br><br>          and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Yet appellants<br><br>          have failed  to provide this  court with  a record from  which we<br><br>          could  determine   whether  the   award  included  the   cost  of<br><br>          prosecuting these claims.<br><br>                    It  is  clear from  the  trial  court's order  awarding<br><br>          attorneys' fees to Miller that the court had before it a detailed<br><br>          bill for Miller's attorneys' services.  Appellants have  not made<br><br>          that  bill,  or any  other  information sufficient  to  support a<br><br>          reasoned decision  by this  court, a part  of the  record.   This<br><br>          court therefore has no basis for determining whether there is any<br><br>          truth to appellants'  assertion that the  fee award against  them<br><br>          included  the cost of litigating  claims on which  Miller did not<br><br><br>                                         -82-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          prevail at trial.   In these circumstances,  we do not reach  the<br><br>          question whether  the trial  court abused  its discretion  in its<br><br>          award  of fees for the simple reason that  we have no basis for a<br><br>          reasoned decision.<br><br>                    When an appellant fails to provide a record of evidence<br><br>          material to the  point the  appellant wishes to  raise, and  thus<br><br>          leaves the appellate court  with an insufficient basis to  make a<br><br>          reasoned  decision,  the  court  in  its  discretion  may  either<br><br>          consider the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or<br><br>          may dismiss the  appeal if the absence  of a full  record thwarts<br><br>          intelligent and reasoned review.

The support  for this assertion consists primarily  of a<br><br>          listing  of  the  claims on  which  plaintiffs  did  not prevail.<br><br>          Appellants cite a statement of the  trial court in a related case<br><br>          in  which the court acknowledged that the Title VII and state-law<br><br>          claims involved different defenses  and varying remedies, as well<br><br>          as  novel issues  of  state law.    Appellants also  assert  that<br><br>          plaintiffs  \"failed to  establish  entitlement to  the fees\"  and<br><br>          \"wholly  failed to explain many of the general entries which were<br><br>          made.\"<br><br>                    At the  hearing, the  trial court heard  testimony from<br><br>          Scarfo's lead  counsel regarding Scarfo's counsel  fees.  Counsel<br><br>          testified that the proffered  itemized bill did not  include work<br><br>          relating to the defamation  claim, or work solely related  to the<br><br><br>                                         -83-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          harassment  claim  or the  emotional  distress claim.

In the present case, the district court did not<br><br>          -- as far as we can tell  on the record before us -- \"make  clear<br><br>          that it considered the relationship between the amount of the fee<br><br>          awarded and the  result obtained.\"  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.\r                                              ___ _______<br><br>          The  court's order  does not  reflect a  Hensley analysis  of the\r                                                   _______<br><br>          relationship among the claims; in fact, it does not indicate what<br><br>          issues  the court  has  determined to  be  interrelated, or  even<br><br>          whether they are issues of fact or law.<br><br>                    Nevertheless,  our review  of  the record  leads us  to<br><br><br>                                         -86-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          conclude   that  Scarfo's   claims  of   sexual  harassment   and<br><br>          intentional  infliction of  emotional distress  shared sufficient<br><br>          common  issues of fact with her successful claims under Title VII<br><br>          and the Equal Pay Act to justify the award made in this case.  In<br><br>          any event, we conclude that appellants should not now be heard on<br><br>          their request  for remand because they did not adequately present<br><br>          this issue  to the trial court  or in the briefs  filed with this<br><br>          court.<br><br>                    The trial court's  order, it is true,  does not address<br><br>          the nature of legal work performed by Scarfo's counsel beyond the<br><br>          research billed for February 2 and February 5, 1993.  But we will<br><br>          not  ourselves consider,  or  remand to  the  district court  for<br><br>          consideration  of,  a blanket  request  not  specific enough  for<br><br>          reasoned  evaluation of the  merits of  the request.   Appellants<br><br>          have failed to meet  their burden of production before  the trial<br><br>          court and their  burden of adequate  briefing before this  court.<br><br>          This  failure deprives both courts  of an opportunity  to make an<br><br>          intelligent and reasoned decision regarding the  segregability of<br><br>          fees  awarded for  any work  related to  losing claims  that took<br><br>          place on days other than February 2 and 5, 1993.<br><br>                    Parties must fulfill certain obligations of specificity<br><br>          of grounds of  claim or defense  if the district  court is to  be<br><br>          able to make a reasoned decision  as to a proper fee award.   The<br><br>          fee-seeker, for example, must provide  a \"particularized account\"<br><br>          of his or her claim for fees.  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 527.  When\r                                         __________<br><br>          a fee-seeker has not won on all counts but properly documents her<br><br><br>                                         -87-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          claim  for fees  and plausibly  asserts that  the time  cannot be<br><br>          allocated between successful and  unsuccessful counts, it becomes<br><br>          the fee-target's burden to  show a basis for segregability.   See\r                                                                        ___<br><br>          Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.  Appellants failed to meet this burden.\r          _______<br><br>                    There was  evidence before  the district court,  in the<br><br>          form of testimony by  Scarfo's counsel, that the requested  award<br><br>          already  reflected  a $75,000  deduction  from  overall costs  to<br><br>          account  for  time spent  solely  on  the  sexual harassment  and<br><br>          infliction  of emotional  distress claims;  the remainder  of her<br><br>          firm's work  on these claims, she testified,  was closely related<br><br>          to the claims on which her client  prevailed.  She also testified<br><br>          that  the award  did  not include  any  expenses related  to  the<br><br>          defamation  claim.    That  testimony  constituted  a  \"plausible<br><br>          assertion\" that counsel had already segregated fees to the extent<br><br>          practicable.   The credibility of that testimony is for the trial<br><br>          court, not this court, to determine.<br><br>                    The defendant  was free to challenge  this assertion by<br><br>          pointing  specifically to  segregable  aspects of  the bill  that<br><br>          formed  the  basis  for  the  award.    The  defendants'   cross-<br><br>          examination of  Scarfo's counsel  regarding  expenses billed  for<br><br>          February 2 and February  5 apparently convinced the judge  that a<br><br>          50% reduction in the  fees for those days was  warranted, despite<br><br>          his  conclusion  that  they  pertained  to  \"interwoven\"  issues.<br><br>          Perhaps  a  further  reduction in  fees  would  have  followed if<br><br>          defendants had  presented an adequate basis  for subjecting other<br><br>          billed  hours to judicial scrutiny.  But defendants did not point<br><br><br>                                         -88-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          to any other purportedly segregable entries in the bill submitted<br><br>          by  Scarfo,   either  during  cross-examination  or   in  written<br><br>          submissions contained in the record before us.<br><br>                    Appellants did not  even assert in the trial court that<br><br>          the award improperly included fees attributable to the defamation<br><br>          or breach of contract claims.<br><br>                    Plaintiffs' contentions  at trial and before this court<br><br>          regarding the segregability of other claims, moreover, are merely<br><br>          statements of conclusions.  The  written submissions to the trial<br><br>          court contained in the record before us merely stated conclusions<br><br>          that the  losing claims \"have  separate and distinct  elements of<br><br>          proof requiring different testimony and documentary evidence\"  or<br><br>          have   a  \"distinct   and  separate   nature\"  and   are  \"easily<br><br>          segregated.\"  Appellants' argument  of segregability on appeal is<br><br>          even less specific than  the arguments advanced before the  trial<br><br>          court.<br><br>                      In  these circumstances, in which we do not even know<br><br>          what arguments the  appellants would make on  remand because they<br><br>          have failed to make those arguments to the trial court  or to us,<br><br>          we  conclude that it would be improper to give appellants another<br><br>          bite at the apple.<br><br>                    Appellants  argue  to  us that  plaintiffs  \"failed  to<br><br>          establish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly  failed to explain<br><br>          many of the general entries which were made.\"  Even if we were to<br><br>          construe  these  assertions  as  arguments  independent   of  the<br><br>          arguments  regarding segregability of fees, they are no more than<br><br><br>                                         -89-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          statements of the conclusion appellants ask us to reach.  They do<br><br>          not constitute adequate  explanation of a basis  for reasoning to<br><br>          this  conclusion from  evidence  of record.

Each party opposing a claim<br><br>          of error asserts that no timely objection or request  was made in<br><br>          the trial court.<br><br>                    Counsel  representing defendants  on appeal  first came<br><br>          into   the  case  after  completion  of  the  jury  trial.    Not<br><br>          surprisingly,  they  seek  to present  contentions  substantially<br><br>          different  from those  presented  by defense  counsel during  and<br><br>          before the jury trial.  Whenever new counsel enter and raise  new<br><br>          contentions,   opposing  counsel   may   find  irresistible   the<br><br>          temptation  to counter with new contentions of their own.

An award of<br><br>          attorneys' fees to a  prevailing party may offset this  burden in<br><br>          part.  But unfairness may remain to opposing parties if the trial<br><br>          or appellate court allows  new grounds of claim or  defense to be<br><br>          asserted.    For  this  reason,  among  others,  we  encounter  a<br><br>          threshold question in this case.<br><br>                    One way  of framing  the threshold question  neutrally,<br><br>          abjuring  \"plain error,\"  United States  v.

Thus, we affirm in substance,<br><br>          though  with  minor exceptions,  and  with  some modification  of<br><br>          amounts of awards, and on condition that a judgment amended as to<br><br><br>                                         -5-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          form be entered in the district court.<br><br>                    We first  explain the  terms of  the judgment  that was<br><br>          ordered  in the district  court and the  nature of  the claims of<br><br>          error.  Then we explain why, in the interests of justice, we hold<br><br>          that  each claim  of  error asserted  in  this appeal  is  either<br><br>          harmless  error  or  is raised  too  late  for  review under  the<br><br>          harmless error standard  and cannot be  sustained under the  more<br><br>          rigorous requirement that relief is to be granted only to avoid a<br><br>          miscarriage of justice.<br><br><br><br>                                          I.\r                                          I.<br><br>                    The first error  we address  is one not  raised by  the<br><br>          parties.   We consider  it because  it might  be thought to  have<br><br>          jurisdictional  implications.   The \"final  judgment\"  entered in<br><br>          this  case was, in its form, not literally in compliance with the<br><br>          requirement  that  \"[e]very  judgment shall  be  set  forth on  a<br><br>          separate document.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 58.<br><br>                    The district court made not one but a series of orders.<br><br>          In most  instances, the order is not  self-explanatory.  Instead,<br><br>          it refers to an opinion  or memorandum of the court to  which one<br><br>          must go  to understand  precisely the meaning  of the order.   In<br><br>          these circumstances,  if, for example, a  party seeks enforcement<br><br>          of the  judgment -- perhaps even after the case is closed and the<br><br>          file  is sent  to storage  -- the  parties and  any  other person<br><br>          required  to  act will  have  great difficulty  finding  out what<br><br>          exactly were the terms of the \"final judgment.\"<br><br><br>                                         -6-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In support  of our  jurisdiction, however,  we conclude<br><br>          that the  district court ordered  the functional equivalent  of a<br><br>          \"final judgment\" in a sequence of orders that includes:<br><br>                         the   \"Judgment\"   of   May   10,   1994<br><br>                    (incorporating,  first, the Order  of June 2,<br><br>                    1993 granting  in part  and  denying in  part<br><br>

and  Postjudgment<br><br>                    Interest.<br><br>                    Were  we to remand for entry of a \"final judgment\" that<br><br>          is  formally in full compliance with Rule 58, before deciding the<br><br>          appeal  that has now  been briefed and argued,  the case would in<br><br>          due course be back before us again with precisely the same issues<br><br><br>                                         -7-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          to be decided as those we perceive from the record now before us.<br><br>          To avoid  the delay  and waste  of resources  incident to such  a<br><br>          remand, we proceed  to consider  the issues now  and will  direct<br><br>          entry of an appropriate amended judgment on remand.<br><br>                    From  close  examination  of  the  several  orders  and<br><br>          memoranda identified  above, we conclude that a final judgment of<br><br>          the substance gleaned  from all these  orders would have  recited<br><br>          provisions in substance as follows:<br><br>                         (a)   judgment  for plaintiff  Scarfo on<br><br>                    her claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights<br><br>                    Act for sex discrimination against defendants<br><br>

Equal  Pay<br><br>                    Act,   in   the   sum   of   $28,000  without<br><br>                    prejudgment interest;<br><br>                         (e)   judgment for defendants

Cabletron is dismissed;<br><br>                         (g)    plaintiff  Scarfo's   claims  for<br><br>                    breach   of   contract  and   defamation  are<br><br>

Levine, and Cabletron are dismissed;<br><br>                         (k)    all  claims by  plaintiff  Miller<br><br>                    against defendant Levine are dismissed;<br><br>                         (l)     it   is  further   ordered  that<br><br>                    plaintiff  Miller  will  not  be  allowed  to<br><br>                    collect  more  than  the larger  of  the  two<br><br>                    awards in his favor against  Cabletron as set<br><br>                    forth in paragraphs (h) and (i).<br><br>                    The substance of paragraph (l) is not explicitly stated<br><br>          in any of the orders identified above.  Implicit in  those orders<br><br>          and  the basis  on  which they  are  explained in  the  memoranda<br><br>          referred  to,  however, is  an  assumption  that  the  awards  to<br><br>          plaintiff Miller  overlap.  Because duplicative  collection would<br><br>          be impermissible,  we conclude it is appropriate to interpret the<br><br>          trial court's orders as  providing that Miller not be  allowed to<br><br>          collect more than the  larger (i.e., the Title VII  award) of the<br><br><br>                                         -10-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          two awards against Cabletron.  See Part XIV, infra.\r                                         ___           _____<br><br>                    On July 19, 1994, the district court awarded attorneys'<br><br>          fees and disbursements to plaintiffs.  Thus, two more paragraphs,<br><br>          as  stated below, may be added to reflect the entire substance of<br><br>          a  final judgment that includes awards of attorneys' fees.  These<br><br>          provisions,  we  note, might  have been  made  in a  later order,<br><br>          rather than in the \"final judgment\" itself.  See Fed.  R. Civ.

The moment immediately  before the jury<br><br>          retires  to  deliberate   is  a  time  when  hard  choices,  with<br><br>          significant  consequences, must be made by the parties and by the<br><br>          trial judge.

Because we conclude that the<br><br>          jury  would  have  reached the  same  verdict  even  had it  been<br><br>                                         -23-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          properly instructed, the  error was harmless.   Thus, it  readily<br><br>          follows that no  miscarriage of  justice or other  blight on  the<br><br>          judicial process has resulted from the error.<br><br>                    The  evidence  of  discrimination  is  powerful.     It<br><br>          contains numerous examples of Cabletron's different treatment  of<br><br>          Scarfo and her male  colleagues who were similarly situated.   On<br><br>          the other hand, it is also true that some evidence  in the record<br><br>          tends to  support defendants'  theory that Scarfo  was fired  for<br><br>          legitimate  business reasons.   In  these circumstances,  we must<br><br>          explain the evidence of record in somewhat greater detail.<br><br>                    Of  course,  a  jury  is   not  required  to  credit  a<br><br>          plaintiff's evidence, even if the evidence is uncontradicted, and<br><br>          neither are we.   But a realistic assessment of the likelihood of<br><br>          a different verdict in this case, had different instructions been<br><br>          given,  depends  in part  on an  examination  of the  strength of<br><br>          Scarfo's  evidence  and  the  findings  it  would  support.    We<br><br>          summarize that evidence.<br><br>                    The strongest evidence on record supporting defendants'<br><br>          theory  was  the  review  of  Scarfo  by  Brian  Miller, Scarfo's<br><br>          immediate supervisor  at Cabletron.    Miller's report  contained<br><br>          several  positive  comments.    But  negative  remarks  regarding<br><br>          Scarfo's management  and purchasing skills dominated  his review.<br><br>          Miller  also   reported  internal  discipline  problems   in  the<br><br>          purchasing department.<br><br>                    The  evidence on  record supporting  plaintiff Scarfo's<br><br>          theory, however, is overwhelming.<br><br><br>                                         -24-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    First, Scarfo's requests to improve her department were<br><br>          overlooked while the  same requests made by  her male replacement<br><br>          were  granted.    After  Scarfo  was hired  as a  buyer and  then<br><br>          promoted to purchasing  supervisor, she was  told that she  would<br><br>          not be eligible for a raise until July 1988.  Scarfo continued to<br><br>          receive a  buyer's salary, though she performed all the functions<br><br>          of a  supervisor.  But in this position she was repeatedly denied<br><br>          requests  to  hire additional  buyers,  train  staff, and  update<br><br>          equipment so that she could focus on her managerial duties.<br><br>                    After  Scarfo  was   terminated,  Justin  O'Connor,   a<br><br>          purchasing  manager,  was  allowed  to  hire  additional  buyers,<br><br>          upgrade equipment,  implement training programs,  and make  other<br><br>          improvements that Scarfo  had previously been  refused permission<br><br>          to make.  Further, unlike Scarfo, O'Connor was permitted to limit<br><br>          his  buying responsibilities so that he could devote more time to<br><br>          his managerial responsibilities.<br><br>                    Second,  when  the  purchasing  department moved  to  a<br><br>          larger  space, Scarfo  was  denied an  office  although her  male<br><br>          colleague was given a  separate office.  Craig Benson,  the chief<br><br>          operating officer at Cabletron,  did not want Scarfo to  have her<br><br>          own office.  Benson, however, knew that Tim Jacobs, who was hired<br><br>          with Scarfo, would have a separate office.<br><br>                    Third,  Scarfo's business trip  expenses were carefully<br><br>          examined.  In contrast,  the expenses of a male colleague who was<br><br>          on  the  same trip  were  not questioned.    Specifically, Benson<br><br>          examined Scarfo's expense vouchers  for a two-week business trip.<br><br><br>                                         -25-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          He  did not  review expense  vouchers of  Roger Lawrence,  a male<br><br>          employee who went on the same trip and whose expenses were nearly<br><br>          identical to those of Scarfo.<br><br>                    Fourth, Benson singled out Scarfo to take the blame for<br><br>          an over-purchase of circuit boards, although other employees were<br><br>          involved with this transaction.   Scarfo had ordered the  boards,<br><br>          but the boards  were subsequently  not needed.   Although  Benson<br><br>          knew that others  besides Scarfo were responsible for  this over-<br><br>          purchase, he  told Miller, \"I don't like  being ripped off, and I<br><br>          blame Jeanne Scarfo for this.\"<br><br>                    Fifth,  Scarfo was treated  differently with respect to<br><br>          stock  options.   Despite  Benson's explanation  that Scarfo  was<br><br>          omitted from the stock option list and his promise that she would<br><br>          be on the next list of stock recipients,  Scarfo, unlike her male<br><br>          counterparts, never received any stock options.<br><br>                    Sixth, in  addition to  the evidence of  these poignant<br><br>          examples of disparate treatment, correlated with gender, there is<br><br>          in the  record other strong  evidence of discrimination.   Scarfo<br><br>          offered evidence that in April 1990, Benson told Miller to hire a<br><br>          \"guy\"  for her  position, but  Miller refused.   Benson  said, \"I<br><br>          don't  care if you fire  or demote her, but I  want a guy in that<br><br>          position.\" Approximately ten days later, Miller was fired.<br><br>                    After Miller's  departure, Scarfo was demoted  to buyer<br><br>          but was asked to continue to perform all management functions.<br><br>                    In  October 1990,  when  Justin O'Connor  was hired  as<br><br>          purchasing manager, Benson told  him that he did not  like Scarfo<br><br><br>                                         -26-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          and urged O'Connor to fire her.  Only ten days after he came onto<br><br>          the  job, O'Connor wrote a  negative review of  Scarfo and placed<br><br>          her on probation through February 1991.<br><br>                    O'Connor terminated Scarfo on January 10, 1991, a month<br><br>          before  the probationary period  expired.  His  reason for firing<br><br>          Scarfo  was   her  failure   to  show   improvement.     In   the<br><br>          circumstances, it would have been difficult  for O'Connor to make<br><br>          a reasonable determination as to whether Scarfo's performance had<br><br>          improved  because Scarfo's  time records  indicated that  she was<br><br>          legitimately absent during her probation period.<br><br>                    Taking  into account  the  weight of  this evidence  of<br><br>          discrimination,  we   conclude  that   the  error  in   the  jury<br><br>          instructions  on Scarfo's Title VII  claim was not  an error that<br><br>          \"seriously affected  the fairness, integrity or public reputation<br><br>          of judicial  proceedings,\"  Lash,  943 F.2d at  152, or caused  a\r                                      ____<br><br>          miscarriage of justice, Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1269.\r                                  _______<br><br>                    We  conclude also  that no  other  basis exists  in the<br><br>          circumstances of this case to  warrant an exception from applying<br><br>          the use-or-lose  proposition stated in Rule 51  and explained, in<br><br>          Part  III  of this  Opinion, as  a  principle aimed  at achieving<br><br>          outcomes of jury trial that are fair and just on the merits.<br><br><br><br>                           V.

As defendants did not use the right, we review the record<br><br>          before us only for evidence of a miscarriage of justice.<br><br>                    In  addition to  the  evidence summarized  in Part  IV,<br><br>          above,  we note additional support  in the record  for the jury's<br><br>          finding on the EPA claim.<br><br>                    Scarfo's economic expert testified that he reviewed and<br><br>          processed  Cabletron  data  on  pay  increments,  education,  and<br><br>          employment  history.   His analysis  showed a  $14,000 difference<br><br>          between  male   and  female   pay  for  Cabletron   managers  and<br><br>          supervisors.  The program accounted for education and seniority.<br><br>                    Further, the  evidence in  the record before  the jury,<br><br><br>                                         -28-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          and before us,  includes data  from personnel files  for men  and<br><br>          women holding similar positions.   For example, at the  same time<br><br>          Cabletron  hired Scarfo, it hired Tim Jacobs.  Unlike Scarfo, who<br><br>          was paid a starting salary of $27,000, Jacobs was given the title<br><br>          of supervisor and paid a starting salary of $35,000.<br><br>                    Moreover, in 1990,  Cabletron hired Justin  O'Connor as<br><br>          purchasing manager at a salary of $65,000.<br><br>                    In  an   attempt  to  justify  this   pay  discrepancy,<br><br>          defendants  call attention  to  evidence that  O'Connor had  more<br><br>          education and  vastly greater experience than Scarfo.   Given the<br><br>          strength of the evidence supporting the EPA claim, however, it is<br><br>          very  unlikely that  the  jury would  have  returned a  different<br><br>          verdict had the  error in the  instruction been corrected  before<br><br>          they deliberated.<br><br><br><br>                VI.  SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM\r                VI.  SCARFO'S APPEAL OF HER HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT CLAIM<br><br>          A.   The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for\r          A.   The Form of Scarfo's Objection to the Charge and Request for<br>               Instruction\r               Instruction<br><br>                    Scarfo presents on appeal  a contention that she frames<br><br>          as  a single  alleged error  in  the charge  to the  jury on  her<br><br>          hostile environment claim.  In our  view, however, the contention<br><br>          raises two  issues that,  though interwoven and  related, involve<br><br>          distinct points,  neither of which  was clearly expressed  in the<br><br>          objection before the trial court.<br><br>                    First,   Scarfo  argues   that  the   court   erred  in<br><br>          instructing  the  jury that  Scarfo  had  to prove  \"unreasonable<br><br>          interference  with her  work performance\"  as an  element  of her\r                                                            _______<br><br>                                         -29-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          claim.<br><br>                    Second, Scarfo  argues, at  least implicitly,  that the<br><br>          court  should  have  instructed  that  in  order  to   show  such<br><br>          interference, the  plaintiff  did  not need  to  prove  that  her<br><br>          tangible productivity had declined,  but only that the harassment<br><br>          so  altered her working conditions  as to make  it more difficult<br><br>          for her to do the job.<br><br>                    Defendants argue  that the  objection, quoted  from the<br><br>          transcript  in  Part  II.C  above,  lacked  the  specificity  and<br><br>          distinctness required by Rule 51 to preserve for appeal any issue<br><br>          regarding the instructions to the jury on the hostile environment<br><br>          claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.\r                  ___<br><br>                    We conclude that  the language of the objection is less<br><br>          explicit than a well-crafted objection  should be.  Although  the<br><br>          objection was  sufficient to inform  the trial court  that Scarfo<br><br>          contended  she was entitled to a \"factors\" instruction as part of<br><br>          the  Title VII charge, it failed to proffer a correct instruction<br><br>          or  in any  other way  to explain  how the  alleged error  in the<br><br>          charge  could  be  corrected.    Also,  the  objection  failed to<br><br>          identify explicitly  the second of  the two issues  stated above,<br><br>          and to explain how the alleged error could be corrected.<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo's objection  thus fell  short of  the<br><br>          clarity  and precision required to  alert the trial  judge to the<br><br>          contentions  now advanced  on  appeal.   It  matters not  whether<br><br>          Scarfo  had by that time  formulated the contentions  as they are<br><br>          now  argued   (rather  than  developing   them  through   further<br><br><br>                                         -30-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          reflection during  later proceedings,  either in the  trial court<br><br>          after verdict,  or on appeal).  In any event, the trial court was<br><br>          not alerted to the contentions now advanced.<br><br>                    We  discuss the  two  related but  separable issues  in<br><br>          turn.<br><br><br><br>          B.   \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element\r          B.   \"Unreasonable Interference\" As a Factor, Not an Element<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo  says that  the  court  erred in  its<br><br>          instruction  to the  jury  that the  plaintiff  must prove  by  a<br><br>          preponderance of  the evidence  an abusive work  environment that<br><br>          \"unreasonably  interfered with her  work performance.\"  Plaintiff<br><br>          argues, citing Harris, that \"unreasonable interference\" was not a\r                         ______<br><br>          separate  element of the claim  (failure to prove  which would be\r                    _______<br><br>          fatal  to the claim),  but only a  factor to  be considered along<br><br>          with all other relevant factors in determining whether an abusive<br><br>          work environment had been proved.<br><br>                    In Scarfo's favor,  we accept the point that  the terms<br><br>          \"element\" and \"factor\",  as they appear in  judicial opinions and<br><br>          commentaries, often signify a key difference between two types of<br><br>          legal tests prescribed by law,  for use by decisionmakers (juries<br><br>          or  judges), in determining whether the  evidence in a particular<br><br>          case satisfies the requirements for a legal theory (of a claim or<br><br>          defense).<br><br>                    One  type   of  legal  test  prescribes   two  or  more<br><br>          \"elements\"  of  a  claim or  defense.    Each  \"element\" must  be<br><br>          satisfied.

One of these \"elements\" is that<br><br>          the work environment was \"hostile\" or \"abusive.\"<br><br>                    Second, the test (or \"sub-test,\" one may prefer to say,<br><br>          to distinguish between the overall test and the internal test for<br><br>          one  \"element\") for determining whether one of the \"elements\" has<br><br>          been satisfied is a  \"factors\" type of test.   More specifically,<br><br>          one  of  the  elements  of  the Harris  test  is  proof  that the\r                                          ______<br><br>          environment  in  which  the  plaintiff worked  was  \"hostile\"  or<br><br>          \"abusive.\"   And the test  (or sub-test) for  determining whether<br><br>          this  \"element\"  has been  satisfied in  a  particular case  is a<br><br>          \"factors\"  test.

Justice Ginsburg, using the\r          ___<br><br>          word  \"dominantly\" rather  than an  absolute or  conclusive term,<br><br>          also  recognized  that   \"unreasonable  interference  with   work<br><br>                                         -33-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          performance\" was  not alone  decisive  as to  whether an  abusive<br><br>          environment exists.

It did\r                          ______<br><br>          not  acknowledge  that the  Harris test  is  in some  respects an\r                                      ______<br><br>          \"elements\" test,  one element being that the work environment was<br><br>          hostile or abusive.  Thus, the trial judge was not alerted to why<br><br>          his use of the language of an \"elements\" test in the charge might<br><br>          be error because  of the particular  way he used it,  even though<br><br>          language such as his would be  proper and even essential as  part<br><br>          of an entirely correct instruction.<br><br>                    Second, the  objection did not  correctly formulate the<br><br>          Harris \"element\" over which there was dispute and satisfaction of\r          ______<br><br>          which must  be  determined by  a  \"factors\" test  (or  sub-test).<br><br>          Thus, even  if the trial judge  understood plaintiff's contention<br><br>          that some  aspect, at  least, of  the overall  Harris test  was a\r                                                         ______<br><br>          \"factors\" test  (or sub-test) for deciding  whether one \"element\"<br><br>          was satisfied, still the objection did not formulate that element<br><br>          clearly enough to tell the trial judge how to correct the alleged<br><br>          error  in  his  instruction.   That  \"element,\"  as  now  clearly<br><br>          formulated  on appeal,   is  not \"unreasonable  interference with<br><br>          work performance.\"  It is, instead, that the work environment was<br><br>          hostile or abusive.<br><br>                    In general, objections to a trial judge's charge to the<br><br>          jury must be clear enough  and explicit enough to tell the  trial<br><br>          judge what  the party wishes the  trial judge to say  in order to<br><br><br>                                         -35-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          correct the alleged error.<br><br>                         See Linn v.

Since the plaintiff  failed to make  a<br><br>          timely objection, we will reverse or award a new trial only if we<br><br>          determine,  based on  our review  of the  record, that  the error<br><br>          resulted in a miscarriage  of justice or \"seriously affected  the<br><br>          fairness,  integrity   or  public  reputation  of   the  judicial<br><br>          proceedings.\"  Lash v.

Harris, however,  does  not prescribe  a\r                        ______     ______<br><br>          particular instruction  on what constitutes a  hostile or abusive<br><br>          work  environment.

Also, we have  no basis for<br><br>          determining  that   the  jury,  in  deciding   whether  the  work<br><br>          environment  was hostile or abusive, did not consider, as part of<br><br>          their  understanding of  the  instruction, factors  such as  \"the<br><br>          frequency  of the  discriminatory  conduct; its  severity;  [and]<br><br>          whether it is physically threatening.\"  Id.

She  argues that the  court's instruction was<br><br>          erroneous  because  it  required  the   jury  to  find  that  the<br><br>          plaintiff's work  performance was inadequate  and that  harassing\r                                            __________<br><br>          discriminatory conduct was a cause of that inadequacy.

Thus,<br><br>          she contends that the court's instruction precluded the jury from<br><br>          considering her theory that the discriminatory conduct  adversely<br><br><br>                                         -37-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          affected  her  work  conditions,  but  not  the  quality  of  her<br><br>          performance.<br><br>                    Was Scarfo's objection to the trial court sufficient to<br><br>          alert the court to the refinement of her theory of  the case that<br><br>          she now argues before us?<br><br>                    The relevant portion of her objection stated:<br><br>                    And we  had requested in our Jury Instruction<br>                    22 a  paragraph that  was not given  but that<br>                    comes from  the recent Harris case  that says<br>                    that you don't have to have the  unreasonable<br>                    interference with  the work performance.

But it is also relevant<br><br>          that  Justice   Ginsburg's   explanation  of   the   meaning   of<br><br>          \"unreasonable  interference\"  was neither  expressly  adopted nor<br><br>          disavowed by the Opinion for the unanimous Court.<br><br>                    For the  reasons  stated  below,  we have  no  need  to<br><br>          decide,  and refrain from deciding,  whether, had a more explicit<br><br>          objection been made, the trial court should  have adopted Justice<br><br>          Ginsburg's interpretation of \"unreasonable interference with work<br><br>          performance.\"<br><br>                    Even  if we assume that the quoted passage from Justice<br><br><br>                                         -39-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          Ginsburg's concurrence is also the view of the Court, we conclude<br><br>          that  plaintiff Scarfo has not met her  burden of showing that an<br><br>          exception to  the use-or-lose  principle should be  invoked here.<br><br>          The  trial court's instruction  on plaintiff's  sexual harassment<br><br>          claim did not elaborate  on the phrase \"unreasonable interference<br><br>          with work  performance.\"  That  instruction did not  preclude the<br><br>          jury  from  considering the  theory  of her  case  that plaintiff<br><br>          Scarfo now emphasizes  -- the theory that her  working conditions<br><br>          had been unreasonably altered even though her performance was not<br><br>          affected.    Justice  Ginsburg's  concurrence treats  the  phrase<br><br>          \"interference with the plaintiff's work performance\" as including<br><br>          an alteration of the  working conditions that makes it  harder to<br><br>          do  the job.  Nothing in any  of the opinions in Harris suggests,\r                                                           ______<br><br>          as  plaintiff now  does  on  appeal,  that  this  phrase  can  be<br><br>          interpreted  to mean only a tangible decline in productivity.  In\r                               ____<br><br>          addition,  the  plaintiff  has  not  shown   any  basis  for  our<br><br>          concluding that the particular instruction at issue in this case,<br><br>          either as a whole or in part, gave the jury the impression that a<br><br>          tangible decline in productivity  was something the plaintiff was<br><br>          required to prove as an element of her claim.<br><br>                    Viewed another way, plaintiff's  argument on appeal  is<br><br>          that the  trial court  should have  given an instruction  stating<br><br>          that the plaintiff can  prove unreasonable interference with work<br><br>          performance either (1) by proving that the discriminatory conduct<br><br>          would cause the quality or quantity of a reasonable person's work<br><br>          to decline  and the plaintiff's  work did so  decline; or (2)  by<br><br><br>                                         -40-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          proving  that a  reasonable person,  subjected to  the harassment<br><br>          that she proved, would  find, and the plaintiff did so find, that<br><br>          the harassment so altered  working conditions as to make  it more<br><br>          difficult  to  do  the job.    If  Scarfo  thought that  such  an<br><br>          instruction would  have been helpful to  the jury's understanding<br><br>          of her claim, Scarfo had the right and opportunity to make such a<br><br>          request.    No  such request  was  made  at  the critical  moment<br><br>          prescribed by Rule 51.<br><br><br><br>          D.

The only  strictly legal<br><br>          question raised by her  appeal on the harassment claim,  however,<br><br>          is the propriety of the jury instruction.

This kind of contention is controlled by Wells.\r                                                              _____<br><br>                    Appellant also argues that a substantial policy  reason<br><br>          mitigates against  a conclusion that  she has failed  to preserve<br><br>          her<br><br>          contention for appeal.  She maintains that if this court requires<br><br>          every party to  file a motion for new trial  as a prerequisite to<br><br>          appeal,  then even  parties who  prevail on  all of  their claims<br><br>          except one -- and decide against appealing the minor loss -- must<br><br>          move for a new trial in anticipation of filing a cross-appeal  if<br><br>          the  other  party  should  appeal.   Such  post-trial  procedure,<br><br>          appellant  urges us  to  conclude, would  unnecessarily clog  the<br><br>          docket.<br><br>                    Appellant  first raised  this  policy  argument in  her<br><br>          reply brief, affording  appellees no opportunity to respond.   In<br><br>          any  event, it  is unconvincing.   At  least  where, as  here, no<br><br>          satisfactory   explanation  has  been  advanced  for  appellant's<br><br>          failure to  seek a new trial, we  conclude that it is appropriate<br><br>          for us  to take account  of the fact  that trial counsel  had the<br><br>          opportunity to decide,  and may  in fact have  decided, that  the<br><br>          potential costs of a new trial outweighed the potential benefits.<br><br>          She  could  have  eased to  some  extent  the burdens  of  such a<br><br>          decision at the post-trial stage, by moving for new trial only as<br><br>          an alternative to a  motion for judgment as a matter  of law.

MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM\r                       VII.  MILLER'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM<br><br>                    Miller  argues  that the  court  erred  in refusing  to<br><br>          instruct  on nonpecuniary  damages.   Cabletron responds  that in<br><br>          fact  the court did instruct on this subject.  The record reveals<br><br>          good reason for confusion over this matter.<br><br>                    During  a  colloquy  with  counsel before  the  closing<br><br>          arguments, the court stated its intention to instruct the jury on<br><br>          \"enhanced compensatory damages,\" and not to instruct the jury  on<br><br>          \"nonpecuniary damages.\"  Miller's  counsel objected at this point<br><br>          to the  omission of an  instruction on nonpecuniary  damages, and<br><br>          the court  expressly restated  its intention  not to instruct  on<br><br>          nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    Miller's counsel, in  reliance on  the court's  ruling,<br><br>          argued  in  his  closing  that  the jury  should  award  enhanced<br><br>          compensatory damages.  Miller's counsel did not argue to the jury<br><br><br>                                         -44-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          that it should award nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    When  the  court instructed  the  jury  just after  the<br><br>          closing arguments, it instructed on nonpecuniary damages, but did<br><br>          not instruct the jury on enhanced compensatory damages.  This was<br><br>          the opposite of the court's previously stated intention.<br><br>                    After the  court's instruction  in  this way,  Miller's<br><br>          counsel  objected -- ostensibly, to apprise the court of the fact<br><br>          that  the  court's  instructions   had  varied  from  its  stated<br><br>          intention.  Miller's counsel  requested that  \"the Court  reverse<br><br>          those two consistent with what you described this morning.\"  This<br><br>          statement  can reasonably  be  interpreted as  a  request for  an<br><br>          instruction  on  enhanced  compensatory  damages  to  replace the\r                                                                _______<br><br>          instruction  on nonpecuniary  damages.  Thus,  Miller's counsel's<br><br>          statement arguably indicated to the judge that Miller had changed<br><br>          his position since his original request.<br><br>                    Following  this colloquy,  the court  re-instructed the<br><br>          jury  on  the wrongful  discharge claim.    This time,  the court<br><br>          instructed the jury on enhanced compensatory damages, but did not<br><br>          withdraw its  earlier instruction on nonpecuniary  damages, or in<br><br>          any other way mention nonpecuniary damages.  No further objection<br><br>          was made by Miller's counsel.<br><br>                    It  is not  clear from  the record  whether  the second<br><br>          instruction was intended to substitute for the first instruction,\r                                      __________<br><br>          or  was intended  as  an  additional  instruction.    The  latter\r                                    __________<br><br>          interpretation  is supported by the form of the verdict, in which<br><br>          the jury  was instructed  to answer special  questions, including<br><br><br>                                         -45-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the damages questions referred to below.<br><br>                    The  jury awarded  Miller  $995,000 in  damages on  the<br><br>          wrongful discharge claim,  but awarded no \"enhanced  compensatory<br><br>          damages.\"   See  Jury Verdict,  Questions 4 and  5.   Although no\r                      ___<br><br>          question on the verdict form specifically addressed \"nonpecuniary<br><br>          damages,\"  Question 4,  which  refers to  damages generally,  may<br><br>          reasonably  have  been  construed by  the  jury  to include  both<br><br>          pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    In  these  circumstances,   the  instructions  and  the<br><br>          verdict  form did not preclude the jury from considering an award<br><br>          of   nonpecuniary  damages  in   accordance  with   the  original<br><br>          instruction,  and the jury's award of  $995,000 may have included<br><br>          such  an award.    Thus,  the  verdict  form  together  with  the<br><br>          instructions does not conclusively demonstrate that, as plaintiff<br><br>          Miller  urges,  the  jury was  not  instructed  on  the issue  of<br><br>          nonpecuniary damages.<br><br>                    Even  if  we were  to conclude  that  the jury  was not<br><br>          instructed on nonpecuniary damages, counsel's failure  to object,<br><br>          after the  \"substitute\" instruction was given, is  an obstacle in<br><br>          the  way  of  Miller's  asserting  error  with  respect  to  this<br><br>          instruction  on appeal.   Moreover,  Miller's  counsel's apparent<br><br>          reversal of his  position -- although arguably intended merely to<br><br>          apprise the court of its inconsistency -- weighs against allowing<br><br>          Miller to assert his original position on appeal.<br><br>                    In addition  to these  obstacles is another.   Although<br><br>          plaintiff argues that the availability of nonpecuniary damages in<br><br><br>                                         -46-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          a  wrongful  discharge  action  is an  open  question,  defendant<br><br>          Cabletron  argues that  nonpecuniary  damages  are not  available<br><br>          under New Hampshire state law in a wrongful termination case.<br><br>                    See Monge v.

Appellants  argue that  we should  do so<br><br>          either on the ground that New Hampshire would not permit a common<br><br>          law  claim for  wrongful  discharge or  on  the ground  that  the<br><br>          district court improvidently exercised supplemental jurisdiction.<br><br>                    Appellants also ask that we set aside the damages award<br><br>          and  remand the case for a new trial with appropriate guidance to<br><br><br>                                         -47-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the district court on  the scope of damages.  This is in effect a<br><br>          reiteration  of  the argument  that  the  jury should  have  been<br><br>          instructed under  New Hampshire statutory law  rather than common<br><br>          law because,  as  appellants concede,  the  principal  difference<br><br>          between the two  -- at least in the context of this case -- is in<br><br>          the scope of the remedies available.<br><br>                    Alternatively, appellants ask  that this court  certify<br><br>          the determinative  question  of  state  common  law  to  the  New<br><br>          Hampshire Supreme Court.<br><br>                    Appellants contend that  this claim  should never  have<br><br>          been submitted to  the jury because New  Hampshire's human rights<br><br>          laws,  see N.H. Rev. Stat.  Ann.   354-A,  provides the exclusive\r                 ___<br><br>          remedy  for  a  claim  of  retaliatory  discharge  based  on  sex<br><br>          discrimination.  Appellee Miller responds that appellants did not<br><br>          properly  preserve the issue for  appeal and that,  in any event,<br><br>          the cited statute does not provide an exclusive remedy.<br><br>                    Appellants acknowledge that they never  objected to the<br><br>          court's instruction  to the jury on the question of damages.  The<br><br>          first time appellants gave the trial judge notice of the argument<br><br>          now  advanced on  appeal was  in a  post-judgment motion  seeking<br><br>          various  forms of relief, including vacatur of judgment and a new<br><br>          trial.<br><br>                    Appellants  contend  that  they  raised  the  issue  of<br><br>          statutory   exclusion   of  common   law   remedies   for  gender<br><br>          discrimination  in a  motion for  summary judgment.

Moreover, even if we were to hold that they had<br><br>          done so, still,  in seeking relief from this court  they face the<br><br>          obstacle that they failed to move on this ground,  under Rule 50,<br><br>          for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.  In<br><br>          view of  this failure to bring the matter to the attention of the<br><br>          trial court after the close of the evidence at trial, their claim<br><br>          of error  on this  ground is  not available  for  review under  a<br><br>          standard  as  favorable  to  appellants  as  the  harmless  error<br><br>          standard.

The  only prejudice<br><br>          that appellants purport to show was an award of damages for pain,<br><br>          suffering, and mental  anguish that, they argue,  is precluded by<br><br>          the   absence  of   nonpecuniary  damages   from   the  statutory<br><br>          specification of exclusive remedies.  Even were we to accept this<br><br>          assertion, and  hence conclude  that plaintiffs were  not legally<br><br>          entitled to  damages for pain, suffering, and mental anguish, the<br><br>          point remains that the record contains evidence of other elements<br><br>          of damages -- evidence more compelling than any evidence of pain,<br><br><br>                                         -49-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          suffering,  and anguish.   Nor  is there  any showing  that pain,<br><br>          suffering, and  anguish were  emphasized by Miller  in presenting<br><br>          his claims  to  the jury.    Finally,  there is  some  doubt,  as<br><br>          explained above, see Part VII, whether the jury could be expected<br><br>          to  understand the charge  as instructing  that they  could award<br><br>          damages  for  pain and  suffering.   At  best, the  suggestion of<br><br>          prejudice is quite speculative.<br><br>                    For these  reasons, we  do not consider  on the  merits<br><br>          appellants'  argument  for vacating  that  part  of the  judgment<br><br>          making an award to  Miller on his claim for  wrongful termination<br><br>          under state common law.  Nor do  we give further consideration to<br><br>          certifying  a question to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire when<br><br>          appellants are procedurally barred from raising on the merits the<br><br>          very issue on which they seek certification.<br><br>                    We also do not  consider whether we should vacate  this<br><br>          part  of the  judgment  on the  ground  that the  district  court<br><br>          improvidently  exercised  supplemental jurisdiction.

Appellant<br><br>          Benson concedes that he did not seek summary judgment against the<br><br>          other plaintiff, Scarfo,  on this ground.   He contends,  though,<br><br>          that  the district  judge's  later  consolidation of  plaintiffs'<br><br>          cases and express  order that the defendants'  motion for summary<br><br>          judgment in the Miller case be  transferred to the main case  and<br><br>          considered re-filed  in that case, rendered  the summary judgment<br><br>          motion applicable to plaintiff Scarfo.  We decline to accept this<br><br>          contention.     To  accept  it  would  imply  that  it  would  be<br><br>          appropriate to enter summary judgment  against a party who  never<br><br>          had  explicit notice  that  her opponent  had  moved for  summary<br><br>          judgment   against  her.     Therefore,   we  consider   Benson's<br><br>          contentions  only as  they apply  to his  appeal of  the judgment<br><br>          against him for his retaliatory firing of Miller.<br><br>                    After  the  trial  court  denied  Benson's  motion  for<br><br>          summary judgment  as to  Miller's claim  of individual  Title VII<br><br>          liability,  Benson did  not raise  the issue  again in  the trial<br><br>          court on a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Thus,<br><br>          the claim of error by  the trial court in concluding, as  a basis<br><br>          for   denying  summary   judgment,  that   Miller  may   be  held<br><br>          individually liable is not available for  review under a standard<br><br>          as favorable to appellants  as the harmless error standard.

The Components of Scarfo's Claims<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo was  awarded  damages on  two of  her<br><br>          claims:  the Title VII sex discrimination claim and the Equal Pay<br><br>          Act claim.  We discuss each of these awards in turn.  To  aid the<br><br>          reader  in understanding the  damages analysis, we  note that the<br><br>          following  dates  are  relevant  to Plaintiff  Scarfo's  damages.<br><br>          Plaintiff Scarfo was terminated  on January 10, 1991.   Plaintiff<br><br>          Scarfo  filed a claim  with the EEOC  on March 6,  1991 and filed<br><br><br>                                         -53-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          this  civil action with the court below  on October 8, 1991.  The<br><br>          first of the Orders that, together, constitute the final judgment<br><br>          in this case was entered on May 10, 1994.<br><br>               1.  Title VII Claim\r               1.  Title VII Claim<br><br>                     The damages  awarded to plaintiff Scarfo  by the trial<br><br>          court  for her successful Title VII claim consist of three types:<br><br>          back pay, front pay, and  damages for the value of  stock options<br><br>          that plaintiff did not receive as a result of the discrimination.<br><br>                    The  court awarded  plaintiff  Scarfo $1,187,901.07  in<br><br>          damages for the  Title VII  violation (consisting of  the sum  of<br><br>          $242,407.07  in back pay, $744,744 in front pay, and $228,750 for<br><br>          the value of stock, reduced by the jury's award of $28,000  under<br><br>          the Equal Pay Act).<br><br>                    The  term back pay  refers to lost  wages commencing on<br><br>          the date two years before the plaintiff's filing with the EEOC to<br><br>          the date of judgment.  Front pay refers to damages for wages from<br><br>          the date of judgment to some specified date in the future.<br><br>                    The back pay and front pay damages awarded by the trial<br><br>          court are to  some extent  overlapping and must  be modified  for<br><br>          reasons explained in Part XI.C below.<br><br><br><br>               2.  The Equal Pay Act Claim\r               2.  The Equal Pay Act Claim<br><br>                    The jury  awarded plaintiff  Scarfo $28,000  in damages<br><br>          for  defendant Cabletron's violation of  the Equal Pay  Act.  The<br><br>          trial court instructed the jury that <br><br>                    Under the  Equal Pay Act,  Ms. Scarfo's award<br>                    of unpaid wages is limited to a period of two<br><br>                                         -54-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    years   prior  to  filing  this  lawsuit  and<br>                    extending  until  her termination  unless she<br>                    proves by  a  preponderance of  the  evidence<br>                    that the violation was  willful.  If you find<br>                    that  Cabletron  acted  willfully,  then  Ms.<br>                    Scarfo may  recover unpaid wages for a period<br>                    of  three years prior  to filing this lawsuit<br>                    and extending until her termination.<br><br>          Cf. 29 U.S.C.   155.\r          ___<br><br>                    We  have  no need  to  decide,  and thus  refrain  from<br><br>          deciding,  whether  this  instruction  on the  law  was  accurate<br><br>          because neither party  objected to the  instruction at trial  and<br><br>          neither has raised the issue before this court.<br><br>                    The special verdict form  does not indicate whether the<br><br>          jury found that  the defendant's  violation was  willful.   Thus,<br><br>          assuming,  as  we  must,  that  the  jury  followed  the  court's<br><br>          instructions,  the jury's  award represents  the damages  for the<br><br>          time span from October 8 of either 1988 or  1989 up to January 10<br><br>          of 1991, when plaintiff Scarfo was terminated.<br><br>                    Neither  plaintiff  Scarfo   nor  defendant   Cabletron<br><br>          challenges the jury's award  under the Equal Pay Act  of $28,000.<br><br>          There is a  lack of  clarity in the  briefs and record,  however,<br><br>          about  whether this recovery is  in addition to  the recovery for<br><br>          violation  of Title VII.   We discuss this  issue in Parts XI.A.3<br><br>          and XI.E below.<br><br><br><br>               3.   Combining to a Nonduplicative Total\r               3.   Combining to a Nonduplicative Total<br><br>                    The award under Title VII is to some extent duplicative<br><br>          of the award under the Equal Pay Act.<br><br>                    Apparently  to avoid  a duplicate  recovery, the  trial<br><br>                                         -55-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          court  subtracted the jury's award  of $28,000 for  the Equal Pay<br><br>          Act  violation  committed by  Cabletron  from  the court's  total<br><br>          calculation of $1,215,901.07  (consisting of $242,407.07 in  back<br><br>          pay, $744,744 in front  pay, and $228,750 for the  value of stock<br><br>          options) in  damages  for the  Title VII  violation committed  by<br><br>          Cabletron and  Benson, resulting in what the court determined was<br><br>          the total Title  VII award  of $1,187,901.07  against Benson  and<br><br>          Cabletron.<br><br>                    Thus, under the  final judgment entered in  the case by<br><br>          the  court  below,  defendants  Cabletron and  Benson  were  held<br><br>          jointly and severally liable for  $1,187,901.07 for the Title VII<br><br>          violation and Cabletron was held liable for an additional $28,000<br><br>          for the Equal  Pay Act  violation.  Since  Benson was not  liable<br><br>          under the Equal  Pay Act,  there is a  problem about  subtracting<br><br>          $28,000  from  the  award  against Benson  to  avoid  duplicative<br><br>          recovery.  We address this problem in Part XI.E below, along with<br><br>          the need for other modifications.<br><br>                    Defendants  Cabletron and  Benson raise  arguments with<br><br>          respect to all three components of  Scarfo's Title VII award.  We<br><br>          discuss each component in turn.<br><br><br><br>          B.   Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay\r          B.   Awards to Scarfo for Back Pay<br><br>                    As stated above, the court awarded Scarfo  back pay for<br><br>          the  Title  VII  claim  in  the  amount  of  $242,407.07  (before<br><br>          reduction by $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act award).<br><br>                    Title VII  permits an  award of back  pay starting  two<br><br><br>                                         -56-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          years before the date of the filing of plaintiff's complaint with<br><br>          the EEOC  (two years before March  6, 1991) up until  the date of<br><br>          judgment.   42  U.S.C.    2000-5(g).   Thus, plaintiff  Scarfo is<br><br>          entitled to back pay  from March 6, 1989  to May 10, 1994.   From<br><br>          March 6, 1989  to the date of her termination,  January 10, 1991,<br><br>          the damages represent the  amount that she was underpaid  because<br><br>          of discrimination on the basis of her sex.  From January 10, 1991<br><br>          to May 10,  1994, damages  represent the amount  she should  have<br><br>          been paid,  if she had  not been terminated  on the basis  of her<br><br>          sex.<br><br>                    The court  performed  a detailed  set  of  calculations<br><br>          based  on   evidence  admitted   at  trial  and   awarded  Scarfo<br><br>          $242,407.07 in back pay  (before reduction to avoid duplication).<br><br>          See Addendum to Court's Order of May 9, 1994.  These calculations\r          ___<br><br>          separate  the time  period for  back pay  into the  relevant sub-<br><br>          periods  and use the salary  rate of an  arguably equivalent male<br><br>          employee  (as a proxy for what plaintiff Scarfo would have earned<br><br>          in the  absence of discrimination)  to calculate the  damages for<br><br>          each day  of each sub-period.  Although  defendants raise several<br><br>          arguments with  respect to these calculations,  we determine that<br><br>          the  court's findings of fact are not \"clearly erroneous\" and the<br><br>          method  of performing  the  calculations was  in accordance  with<br><br>          applicable law.<br><br>                    In  particular,  the  defendants  criticize  the  trial<br><br>          court's use of the salaries of two other Cabletron employees, Mr.<br><br>          O'Connor  and Mr. Jacob,  in the calculations.   Defendants argue<br><br><br>                                         -57-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          that the trial court erred in comparing plaintiff Scarfo to these<br><br>          two   employees  because   these   two   employees  had   greater<br><br>          responsibilities at  Cabletron.  This argument  fails because the<br><br>          trial court  reasonably could have determined  that Scarfo either<br><br>          had  a similar level of  responsibility or would  have been given<br><br>          similar responsibilities but for discrimination.<br><br>                    The  court calculated  damages  up until  May 4,  1994,<br><br>          only, instead of May 10, 1994.  No party, however, has raised any<br><br>          issue on appeal regarding this  period of approximately one week,<br><br>          and  we do  not disturb  the trial  court's calculations  in this<br><br>          respect.<br><br><br><br>          C.  Scarfo's Front Pay Award\r          C.  Scarfo's Front Pay Award<br><br>                    The court awarded Scarfo  $744,744 as front pay.   In a<br><br>          Title  VII case, the court has discretion to award front pay from<br><br>          the date of judgment  forward when reinstatement is impracticable<br><br>          or impossible.<br><br>                    See Goss v.

In<br><br>          light of the evidence that  she had only a ten percent  chance of<br><br>          returning to full employment at an equivalent salary, the court's<br><br>          finding  that   Scarfo  will  be  unable   to  find  professional<br><br>          employment in the future is not clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    Defendants  also argue  that  the  \"court imported  the<br><br>          erroneous  concept of displaced worker into the case.\"  The court<br><br>          did  not explain the meaning  of \"displaced worker,\"  nor has our<br><br>          attention been  called to  any published  opinion that  uses this<br><br>          terminology in the Title  VII context.  In any  event, regardless<br><br>          of  the  terminology used,  plaintiff  Scarfo's  ability to  find<br><br>          similar  employment in the future  is relevant both  to the trial<br><br>          court's decision to  award front  pay and to  the calculation  of<br><br>          such an award.  The  trial court did not abuse its  discretion in<br><br>          awarding front pay to the plaintiff.<br><br>                    In calculating  Scarfo's  front pay  award,  the  court<br><br>          adopted  the   calculations   of  plaintiff's   expert   witness.<br><br><br>                                         -59-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          Defendants do not dispute that these calculations were admissible<br><br>          and  were  adequately  explained   by  the  expert's  report  and<br><br>          testimony; rather, they now question merely the weight  the court<br><br>          gave to this  evidence by  pointing out concessions  made by  the<br><br>          expert during the cross-examination.  The defendants' contentions<br><br>          fail  because  the choice  by the  court,  as factfinder  for the<br><br>          purpose of calculating damages,  to give probative weight  to the<br><br>          expert's calculations was not clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    In another respect, however, we conclude that the court<br><br>          erred  in adopting  and  using  the  expert's calculations  as  a<br><br>          measure of front pay.  The expert's calculation of damages in the<br><br>          amount of  $973,494, which the  court adopted for  Scarfo's front<br><br>          pay award,  was for a period  commencing on January 1,  1991.  As<br><br>          stated above, \"front pay\"  usually refers to an award  for future<br><br>          salary payments starting  on the  date of the  judgment, in  this<br><br>          case, May  10, 1994.  Since  the court, in addition  to its front<br><br>          pay award, also awarded back pay for the time period up until the<br><br>          date of the  verdict on  May 4, 1994,  plaintiff Scarfo  obtained<br><br>          duplicate damages for  the period from January 1, 1991  to May 4,<br><br>          1994.<br><br>                    \"[T]he law  abhors duplicative recoveries.

The court adopted the expert's calculations for the front<br><br>          pay award  and performed  its own calculations  to determine  the<br><br><br>                                         -60-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          back pay award.

To  avoid duplicative<br><br>          recovery, plaintiff Scarfo's combined  total of Title VII damages<br><br>          should be reduced either by the amount the court  awarded as back<br><br>          pay for the  period from January 1, 1991  to May 10, 1994,  or by<br><br>          the amount the court ordered as front pay for that same period.<br><br>                    For  two  reasons  we   choose  the  latter  method  of<br><br>          determining the measure of the duplication that must be  avoided.<br><br>          First,  unlike  the court's  calculations  for  that period,  the<br><br>          expert's calculations  include social security  contributions and<br><br>          fringe benefits.  Therefore, the amount derived from the expert's<br><br>          calculations is a larger amount than the amount calculated by the<br><br>          court for that period.  Thus, it is more consistent with our goal<br><br>          of modification only as  needed to avoid duplicative  recovery to<br><br>          decrease  the  total award  by the  smaller  amount, that  is the<br><br>          amount  the  court  calculated  for back  pay  for  that  period.<br><br>          Second,  since  the expert's  calculations  were  computed on  an<br><br>          annual  basis and  the court's  calculations were  computed on  a<br><br>          daily basis, using the  back pay measure calculated by  the court<br><br>          for the period from January 10, 1991 to May 10, 1994 makes for an<br><br>          easier and more precise calculation of the duplication.<br><br>                    As stated above,  the trial court calculated  plaintiff<br><br>          Scarfo's Title VII damages to be $1,215,901.07 (before adjustment<br><br>          for  the Equal Pay Act  award) consisting of  $242,407.07 in back<br><br><br>                                         -61-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          pay, $744,744 in  front pay, and $228,750 for  the value of stock<br><br>          options.   The portion of the court's back pay award attributable<br><br>          to the period for January 1, 1991 to May 10, 1994 is $224,013.12.<br><br>          Thus, to avoid  duplication, we reduce the court's calculation of<br><br>          Title VII damages by  $224,013.12, resulting in a back  pay award<br><br>          of $18,393.95  ($242,407.07 less $224,013.12), and a total sum of<br><br>          Title VII  damages (before  adjustment with respect  to Cabletron<br><br>          for  the  Equal Pay  Act  award)  of  $991,887.95, consisting  of<br><br>          $18,393.95  for the period up  to January 10,  1991, $744,744 for<br><br>          the period  commencing January  10,  1991, and  $228,750 for  the<br><br>          value of stock options.  Both defendants Cabletron and Benson are<br><br>          jointly and severally liable  for this amount.  This  amount does<br><br>          not include the adjustment (discussed below in Part XI.E) for the<br><br>          jury's Equal Pay Act award against Cabletron only.<br><br><br><br>          D.   Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options\r          D.   Scarfo's Damage Award for Stock Options<br><br>                    The court  awarded damages to plaintiff  Scarfo for the<br><br>          value  of stock  options she would  have received if  she had not<br><br>          been discriminated against on the basis  of sex.  The court found<br><br>          that Scarfo would have been given options to purchase 2500 shares<br><br>          of stock at a purchase price of $15.50.  The court found that the<br><br>          value  of the stock was $107.00 per  share around the time of the<br><br>          trial  and  awarded Scarfo  $228,750  in  damages ($107.00  minus<br><br>          $15.50 times 2,500).<br><br>                    Defendants raise only one argument with respect to this<br><br>          damages award;  they say  that Scarfo is  barred from  recovering<br><br><br>                                         -62-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          these damages on the  basis of res  judicata.  Before filing  the<br><br>          civil  action in federal court,  Scarfo filed an  action with the<br><br>          New Hampshire Department of Labor.  In that action, the plaintiff<br><br>          sought  to  recover compensation  under  N.H. Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  <br><br>          275:51.<br><br>                    See N.H. Rev. Stat.

The district judge dismissed the  breach of<br><br>          contract claim on the basis of res judicata because it stated the<br><br>          same cause of action the  plaintiff had already adjudicated under<br><br>          N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   275:51.<br><br>                    Defendants assert that because the plaintiff was barred<br><br>          from recovering  damages  for stock  options  under a  breach  of<br><br>          contract theory,  the plaintiff should be  barred from recovering<br><br>          damages for stock  options under a  Title VII sex  discrimination<br><br>          theory.  This argument lacks merit.  Under defendants' reasoning,<br><br>          the  plaintiff would be barred  from recovering any  type of lost<br><br>          compensation (including  wages) under Title VII,  because she had<br><br>          adjudicated a breach of  contract claim for lost wages  and other<br><br>          compensation in  the Department of  Labor proceedings.   But  res<br><br>          judicata bars causes  of action, not types of damages recoverable<br><br>                                         -63-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          under  some  other  claim  not  subject  to  adjudication  in the<br><br>          tribunal rendering the judgment.<br><br>                    See In Re Alfred P., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></span>, 629 (1985)(\"The\r                    ___ _______________<br>               doctrine of res judicata  precludes the litigation in a<br>               later  case of matters  actually litigated, and matters<br>               that could  have been  litigated, in an  earlier action<br>               between  the  same  parties   for  the  same  cause  of<br>               action.\").<br><br>          Plaintiff's Title VII cause  of action is  not the same cause  of<br><br>          action as  her breach of  contract action; it  requires different<br><br>          elements  to be proved.  These different elements were not tried,<br><br>          and could not have been tried, in the New Hampshire Department of<br><br>          Labor  hearings.  Thus, plaintiff Scarfo's Title VII claim is not<br><br>          barred by res judicata.<br><br>                    Since  the defendants  raise  no  other arguments  with<br><br>          respect to the  trial court's award of $228,750 for  the value of<br><br>          stock options not received by plaintiff Scarfo, we do not disturb<br><br>          the trial court's award.<br><br><br><br>          E.   Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award\r          E.   Avoiding Duplication of the Equal Pay Act Award<br><br>                    As   described  above,   the  trial   court  originally<br><br>          calculated  Title  VII  damages   to  be  $1,215,901.07.    Then,<br><br>          recognizing  the need  to avoid  duplicative recovery,  the court<br><br>          subtracted $28,000 for the Equal Pay  Act claim.  Thus, under the<br><br>          final  judgment  entered  by  the  court  (as  gleaned  from  the<br><br>          collection of Orders referred to in Part II, supra) Cabletron was\r                                                       _____<br><br>          held liable  for $1,187,901.07  for the  Title VII  violation and<br><br>          $28,000 for the Equal Pay Act violation.<br><br>                    Defendants argue  that the  court erred  in subtracting<br><br>                                         -64-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          the Equal  Pay  Act award  from  the back  pay  component of  the<br><br>          court's Title  VII award.  We  agree that the method  used by the<br><br>          trial court to avoid duplicate recoveries was at  best confusing,<br><br>          if not erroneous, for two reasons.  First, the back pay component<br><br>          of the Title VII damages award and the jury's Equal Pay Act award<br><br>          represent  damages  for different  time  periods.   Second,  only<br><br>          defendant Cabletron  (and not  defendant Benson) is  liable under<br><br>          the  Equal Pay  Act.   Thus,  we  make the  following  additional<br><br>          adjustment.<br><br>                    In Part XI.C above, our modification of the total Title<br><br>          VII damages resulted in a calculation of Title VII damages in the<br><br>          amount of $991,887.95.   The remaining question before us  is how<br><br>          appropriately to modify this  award to avoid duplicative recovery<br><br>          by plaintiff Scarfo.<br><br>                    The  portion   of  our   modified  Title   VII  damages<br><br>          calculation representing damages from March 6, 1989 to January 1,<br><br>          1991 is  $18,393.95.  The  jury's Equal Pay Act  award of $28,000<br><br>          represents damages for the  same injury, namely discrimination in<br><br>          pay on the  basis of sex, for a period  commencing either October<br><br>          8, 1988 or October 8, 1989 and extending to January 10, 1991, the<br><br>          date  of her termination.   Thus, regardless of  whether the jury<br><br>          found willfulness, these time periods overlap to some extent.<br><br>                    We consider separately the two cases (the two different<br><br>          periods, and as a result the two different methods of calculation<br><br>          to avoid an overlap).<br><br>                    If  the jury found wilfulness, the EPA award of $28,000<br><br><br>                                         -65-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          represents the period from  October 8, 1988 to January  10, 1991.<br><br>          This time period is  longer than, and includes entirely  the time<br><br>          period  of March 6,  1989 to January  1, 1991,  for which damages<br><br>          were  calculated  at   $18,393.95.    Thus,  if  the  jury  found<br><br>          wilfulness, the appropriate way  to avoid duplicative recovery is<br><br>          to  reduce the  Equal  Pay  Act  award  by  $18,393.95,  so  that<br><br>          Cabletron is liable to  plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95  for the<br><br>          Title VII violation and an additional $9,606.05 for the Equal Pay<br><br>          Act violation.<br><br>                    If  the jury did not find wilfulness, the Equal Pay Act<br><br>          award  of $28,000 represents the  period from October  8, 1989 to<br><br>          January 10,  1991.  This is  a shorter time period  than the time<br><br>          period from March 6, 1989 to January 1, 1991 for  which the judge<br><br>          awarded $18,393.95.  If we could determine that  the jury did not<br><br>          find wilfulness,  the more accurate  adjustment we could  make to<br><br>          avoid duplicative recovery would  be to reduce the Equal  Pay Act<br><br>          award  by  $12,367.55,   the  amount  of  the  Title   VII  award<br><br>          representing damages from October 8, 1989 to January 1, 1991.<br><br>                    Since  we  cannot  determine  whether  the  jury  found<br><br>          wilfulness,  we   conclude  that  it  is   appropriate  in  these<br><br>          circumstances  to  accept  the  reduction  of  $18,393.95  as  an<br><br>          appropriate adjustment to avoid overlap (instead of the reduction<br><br>          of $12,367.55).  If, in fact, the jury's award was not based on a<br><br>          finding of wilfulness and accordingly  the appropriate adjustment<br><br>          is a reduction  of $12,367.55,  then the  prejudice to  plaintiff<br><br>          Scarfo is quite small (i.e., $6,026.40) in comparison either with<br><br><br>                                         -66-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          her  total  recovery or  with  the cost  to  her, as  well  as to<br><br>          opposing parties and the public,  of a remand for a new  trial on<br><br>          the sole issue of whether Cabletron's Equal Pay Act violation was<br><br>          wilful.   Having failed to request an explicit jury finding as to<br><br>          wilfulness,  Scarfo  is  in  no  position  to  complain  of  this<br><br>          resolution of the issue.<br><br>                    Thus,  after  the  reduction  of  $18,393.95  to  avoid<br><br>          overlap, Cabletron is liable  to plaintiff Scarfo for $991,887.95<br><br>          for the Title VII  violation and an additional $9,606.05  for the<br><br>          Equal Pay Act violation.<br><br>                    Since the Equal  Pay Act claim was  not brought against<br><br>          defendant Benson,  Benson is liable  only for Title  VII damages.<br><br>          In  accordance with the explanation  above, Benson is jointly and<br><br>          severally  liable  to  Scarfo  for  Title  VII  damage  totalling<br><br>          $991,887.95  consisting  of  $18,393.95  for  the  period  before<br><br>          January 10, 1991; $744,744 for the period after January 10, 1991;<br><br>          and $228,750 in stock options.<br><br>                    We  emphasize that these  adjusted calculations are not<br><br>          intended to alter the usual terminology and relevant time periods<br><br>          for  damages under Title VII.   As explained  above, a successful<br><br>          plaintiff  (one who  has  proved liability  under  Title VII)  is<br><br>          entitled to back  pay for a Title  VII violation starting on  the<br><br>          date two years before the plaintiff's EEOC  filing and continuing<br><br>          until the date of judgment.  A court, in its discretion, may also<br><br>          award front pay for a Title VII violation starting on the date of<br><br>          judgment and continuing to some specified date in the future.<br><br><br>                                         -67-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                          XII.   PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES\r                          XII.   PLAINTIFF MILLER'S DAMAGES<br><br>                    The jury  found defendants Cabletron and  Benson liable<br><br>          to plaintiff  Miller under  Title VII for  retaliatory discharge.<br><br>          The  court  awarded  plaintiff  Miller $190,651.85  in  back  pay<br><br>          representing lost compensation from the date of  his discharge to<br><br>          the date of judgment.  The court awarded Miller $995,000 in front<br><br>          pay purportedly  representing lost compensation from  the date of<br><br>          judgment forward.  The court also awarded Miller $206,060 for the<br><br>          value of stock  options that he  did not receive  because of  his<br><br>          discharge.    These  three  calculations total  $1,391,711.85  in<br><br>          damages for the Title VII violation.<br><br>                    The defendants  raise no arguments with  respect to the<br><br>          court's back pay award  of $190,651.85.  We discuss, in turn, the<br><br>          defendants  arguments with respect  to the front  pay damages and<br><br>          the damages for the value of the stock options.<br><br><br><br>          A.   Miller's Damages for Front Pay\r          A.   Miller's Damages for Front Pay<br><br>                    Defendants argue that the court's method of calculating<br><br>          damages  for front  pay was  an abuse  of discretion.   The  jury<br><br>          awarded   plaintiff  Miller  $995,000  in  damages  for  Miller's<br><br>          wrongful  discharge claim  under  New Hampshire  state law.   The<br><br>          court, for a reason not stated, assumed that this sum represented<br><br>          damages  for front pay only.   Thus, the  court incorporated this<br><br>          sum  of  $995,000  into the  court's  calculations  of  Title VII<br><br>          damages as the damages for front pay.<br><br>                    As  stated above, we review a court's decision to award<br><br><br>                                         -68-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          front  pay damages  under the  abuse-of-discretion standard.   We<br><br>          conclude that  the defendants are  correct in asserting  that the<br><br>          court's decision to use  the jury's figure of $995,000  for front<br><br>          pay damages was an  abuse of discretion because the  jury's award<br><br>          may have included some back pay, some amount for the value of the<br><br>          stock options, and some amount as damages for pain and suffering.<br><br>          Plaintiff  Miller, in  a post-trial  motion and  in his  brief as<br><br>          appellee, agrees that the court erred in this respect.<br><br>                    The  jury was  instructed  that if  it found  Cabletron<br><br>          liable   on  the state  law wrongful  termination claim,  it must<br><br>          consider two types of damages:<br><br>                    First, you must determine the amount of wages<br>                    and  fringe  benefits  he  would  have earned<br>                    through  employment with  defendant Cabletron<br>                    . . . if  he had  not been discharged  on May<br>                    30th,  1990,  to  the date  of  your verdict.<br>                    Second,  you must  determine  the  amount  of<br>                    future   wages   and   fringe   benefits   he<br>                    reasonably   would   have   earned   in   his<br>                    employment with Cabletron if  he had not been<br>                    discharged.<br><br>          This instruction clearly  permits the jury to award both back-pay<br><br>          damages  and front-pay damages.  The verdict form did not require<br><br>          the jury to report the  two separately.  The $995,000 awarded  by<br><br>          the  jury is reasonably interpreted as an award for both back pay<br><br>          and  front  pay.   As  explained  above,  the  $995,000 may  have<br><br>          included,  also, damages for pain and suffering.  Thus, the court<br><br>          erred  in  using  the jury's  award  on  the  state law  wrongful<br><br>          termination claim as the measure of front pay damages under Title<br><br>          VII.<br><br>                    At  trial, plaintiff  Miller's  expert  testified  that<br><br>                                         -69-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          $211,000  was  the  appropriate   award  for  front-pay  damages.<br><br>          Plaintiff Miller  has asked  this court,  in correcting  for this<br><br>          error, to reduce the award for front-pay damages from $995,000 to<br><br>          $211,000, the  amount  calculated by  plaintiff Miller's  expert.<br><br>          Defendants  Cabletron and  Benson  argue that  this court  should<br><br>          vacate the entire  award for  front pay because  the trial  court<br><br>          abused its discretion  in deciding  to make any  award for  front<br><br>          pay.<br><br>                    The court  below found that Miller  did make reasonable<br><br>          efforts to  procure employment, but that the  courier business he<br><br>          began in  1991 has not  yet made a  profit.  We  will not disturb<br><br>          this finding of fact because the defendants have not shown it  to<br><br>          be clearly erroneous.  From this finding, we infer that the court<br><br>          also  found that  it was  impracticable for  Miller to  return to<br><br>          Cabletron and that Miller  had made reasonable efforts to  find a<br><br>          job with the  same earning capacity.  Miller is  thus entitled to<br><br>          damages for front pay.  The court's determination that Miller was<br><br>          entitled to an award of front pay was not an abuse of discretion,<br><br>          and we will not disturb that determination.<br><br>                    Plaintiff's proposal  to this  court that the  award be<br><br>          reduced from $995,000  to $211,000  -- if the  proposal had  been<br><br>          made  to and  accepted  by the  trial  court --  has  evidentiary<br><br>          support in the testimony of plaintiff's expert.<br><br>                    This court has authority to modify a damages award when<br><br>          all the necessary factfindings have been made in the court below.<br><br>          Cf.  Lipsett, 975  F.2d at  943 (modifying an  award of  fair and\r          ___  _______<br><br><br>                                         -70-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          reasonable attorneys'  fees when  the  trial court  made a  legal<br><br>          error with respect to  the method of calculation).   Reducing the<br><br>          award to  $211,000, however, as plaintiff  Miller requests, would<br><br>          require this court to evaluate the credibility of the plaintiff's<br><br>          expert and  to make a new finding of  fact, not made in the trial<br><br>          court, that Miller is  entitled to $211,000 in damages  for front<br><br>          pay.<br><br>                    Since  we do not have the authority to make findings of<br><br>          fact  in order  to modify the  award in  the manner  requested by<br><br>          plaintiff, we vacate the front pay award.<br><br>                    We  remand this  case  to the  district  court for  the<br><br>          limited  purpose of  determining  an appropriate  amount for  the<br><br>          front pay award.   The district court, on  remand, may allow  the<br><br>          interested parties a reasonable time period within  which to file<br><br>          with the district court  a stipulation resolving this issue  (for<br><br>          example, a stipulation  such as Miller's  proposal to this  court<br><br>          that his award for front pay be reduced to  $211,000 and judgment<br><br>          be  entered accordingly).   If  no such  agreement is  filed, the<br><br>          trial court is to determine the amount of the award to Miller for<br><br>          front pay.  The trial court may find it appropriate to act on the<br><br>          present record of evidence  and adopt the plaintiff's calculation<br><br>          of $211,000 for  front pay.  It  may instead calculate front  pay<br><br>          damages from the date of judgment (May 10, 1994) forward in  some<br><br>          other  manner supported by the present record of evidence.  Also,<br><br>          the court, in  its discretion  and for cause  shown, may  receive<br><br>          additional evidence bearing upon this issue.<br><br><br>                                         -71-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          B.   Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options\r          B.   Miller's Damages Award for Stock Options<br><br>                    During his employment, plaintiff  Miller was told that,<br><br>          over a specific period of  time, he would be given stock  options<br><br>          that  would allow  him to  purchase 10,000 shares  of stock  at a<br><br>          purchase price of  $3.97 per  share.  During  his employment,  he<br><br>          received  options to purchase only 2,000 shares.  During the time<br><br>          period from the date of  his termination (April 20, 1990)  to the<br><br>          date of judgment (May 10, 1994) Miller alleges that he would have<br><br>          received options to  purchase 5,000 shares.   Miller also alleges<br><br>          that within a month of the date of judgment, his right to options<br><br>          with respect  to the  remaining 3,000  shares would  have vested.<br><br>          Thus,  Miller's counsel  argued  to the  trial court  that Miller<br><br>          should have been  awarded damages  for the value  of options  for<br><br>          8,000 shares of stock.<br><br>                    The court awarded plaintiff  Miller $206,060 in damages<br><br>          for the  value of  2,000  shares of  stock.   The  court did  not<br><br>          explain how  it determined the  number 2,000 to be  the number of<br><br>          shares of stock.<br><br>                    Defendants-appellants, in their brief on appeal, do not<br><br>          dispute the facts, as alleged  by plaintiff Miller, regarding the<br><br>          options  for  10,000 shares.    In  an effort  to  point out  all<br><br>          potential errors made by  the district court in support  of their<br><br>          argument that this court should vacate both awards entirely, they<br><br>          argue that the trial  court erred in deciding to award Miller the<br><br>          value  of 2,000 stock options.  Defendants suggest that the trial\r                    _____<br><br>          court mistakenly  thought that Miller had  already received stock\r                                                             ________<br><br><br>                                         -72-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          options for 8,000  of the 10,000 shares, when,  in fact, this was<br><br>          the amount he had not received because of his termination.\r                            ___ ________<br><br>                    The  brief of  appellee  Miller agrees  that the  court<br><br>          erred, and suggests (adopting defendants' reasoning in part) that<br><br>          the  court  should  have  awarded $824,240,  the  value  of stock<br><br>          options for 8,000 shares.<br><br>                    The implications  of defendants' argument on appeal are<br><br>          troubling.  They  have requested,  in the event  that this  court<br><br>          does not  reverse the  liability determination on  Miller's Title<br><br>          VII claim,  that this  court  set aside  Miller's entire  damages<br><br>          award  and remand.   If the remand  were limited to  trial of the<br><br>          issue of damages for the value of stock, however, the trial court<br><br>          might award either the value of 5,000 shares of stock (the amount<br><br>          vesting  before  the date  of judgment),  or  the value  of 8,000<br><br>          shares of stock.   In  either case, the  probable consequence  of<br><br>          retrying only this issue would be an additional liability, beyond<br><br>          that  already awarded by the  trial court, of  either $309,090 or<br><br>          $618,180 in favor of plaintiff Miller.<br><br>                    Miller's  brief as  appellee  requests that  this court\r                                                                 ____<br><br>          award  damages for the value  of stock options  for 8,000 shares.<br><br>          Defendants  respond that we should not  grant this request (which<br><br>          would increase the total  damages award) because plaintiff Miller<br><br>          did  not appeal the award of damages in his cross-appeal; rather,<br><br>          plaintiff Miller  raised this argument only in its appellee brief<br><br>          responding to the defendants' appeal.<br><br>                    We  refrain from  modifying the  judgment to  award the<br><br><br>                                         -73-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          value of 8,000 stock options because to do so would require  this<br><br>          court  to  make  new findings  of  fact.   We  also  refrain from<br><br>          remanding this issue to  the trial court for the  limited purpose<br><br>          of determining an appropriate  award for the value of  lost stock<br><br>          options because neither party has requested  that we do so.  Both<br><br>          parties have  requested that  this court  take  actions that  are<br><br>          beyond this  court's authority.   Since neither  party's position<br><br>          has merit, we simply  affirm the trial court's award  of $206,060<br><br>          for the value of stock options for 2,000 shares of stock.<br><br>                             XIII.

The Arguments of the Parties<br><br>                    There is some confusion  both in the record and  in the<br><br>          parties' briefs  about  whether  the  court  awarded  prejudgment<br><br>          interest  on  any  part  of Scarfo's  damages  award  and whether<br><br>          prejudgment interest,  if awarded,  was appropriate.   Defendants<br><br>          argue  that the  court awarded  prejudgment interest  on Scarfo's<br><br>          Title  VII  award, and  that this  was  error.   Plaintiff Scarfo<br><br>          argues that the trial court refused to award prejudgment interest<br><br>          on Scarfo's Title VII award.<br><br>                    We  conclude from a review of the record that the trial<br><br>          court  denied prejudgment interest on every  element of the award<br><br>          to plaintiff Scarfo.   In  answer to  Question 6  of the  verdict<br><br>          form, the  jury  answered \"NO,\"  finding  against Scarfo  on  her<br><br>          prejudgment  interest claim.  By its Order  of July 20, 1994, the<br><br>          court stated as to all of  Scarfo's claims, \"Prejudgment interest<br><br>          is disallowed.\"<br><br><br>                                         -74-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    With respect to the  judgment for plaintiff Miller, the<br><br>          defendants have not raised  on appeal any objection to  the trial<br><br>          court's  award  of prejudgment  interest  on  Miller's state  law<br><br>          wrongful  termination  claim at  the rate  of  10% per  annum, as<br><br>          mandated  by N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    524:1-b and    336:1.  With<br><br>          respect  to Miller's  Title  VII award,  however,  there is  some<br><br>          confusion  in  the  parties'  briefs about  whether  the  parties<br><br>          understood  that the  court awarded  prejudgment interest  on any<br><br>          part of the award.   The parties' briefs assume  that prejudgment<br><br>          interest was awarded  on the entire Title  VII award.   From this<br><br>          premise, the parties  dispute whether it was  appropriate for the<br><br>          court  to award prejudgment interest  on the front  pay award and<br><br>          the  portion of the back  pay award representing  damages for the<br><br>          period from the date Miller's complaint was filed  to the date of<br><br>          judgment.<br><br>                    We  conclude from a review of the record that the trial<br><br>          court allowed  prejudgment interest  on Miller's state  law claim<br><br>          for wrongful  termination, but not on any aspect of his Title VII<br><br>          claim.  In its answer to Question 6 of the verdict form, the jury<br><br>          answered  \"NO,\" thus  finding  against Miller  on  his claim  for<br><br>          prejudgment interest.   But  in his Order  of July 19,  1994, the<br><br>          trial  judge \"abrogate[d]\" that finding  insofar as it applied to<br><br>          the state law claim for  wrongful termination and awarded  Miller<br><br>          prejudgment  interest from the date of filing of the complaint to<br><br>          the date of the verdict.<br><br>                    Since, contrary  to the contentions of  the parties, we<br><br><br>                                         -75-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          have  concluded that  the trial court  did not  award prejudgment<br><br>          interest on  plaintiff Scarfo's and plaintiff  Miller's Title VII<br><br>          awards, the  only question remaining  is whether the  trial court<br><br>          erred  by  denying prejudgment  interest  on all  aspects  of the<br><br>          plaintiffs' Title VII awards.<br><br>                    A   trial  court   has  discretion  whether   to  award<br><br>          prejudgment interest on a successful Title VII claim.<br><br>                    See Earnhardt v.

Electro Switch  Corp., 523  N.E.2d\r                    ___  ______     _____________________<br>               255,  258-59 (Mass.  1988)(prejudgment interest  is not<br>               available under Massachusetts  law for awards of  front<br>               pay   for   violations   of   a   Massachusetts   anti-<br>               discrimination statute).<br><br>          Moreover,  the plaintiffs'  experts,  in calculating  damages for<br><br>          front pay,  correctly chose to discount  the amounts representing<br><br>          the plaintiffs' future wages  at an appropriate interest  rate in<br><br>          order  to determine  the present  value of  the future  stream of<br><br>          income to which each plaintiff would have been entitled.<br><br>                    Thus, as stated in the Conclusion below, we affirm  the<br><br>          trial court's  denial of  prejudgment interest  on the  front pay<br><br>          components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.<br><br><br><br>          C.   Awards for the Value of Stock Options\r          C.   Awards for the Value of Stock Options<br><br>                    In  this   case,  defendants  argue   that  prejudgment<br><br>          interest should not be awarded on the value of the stock options,<br><br>          since the amount of damages  was based on the price of  the stock<br><br>          on or near the date of  judgment.  If the plaintiffs had received<br><br>          the stock options  at the time due and had  not transferred them,<br><br>          the plaintiffs would have  been in possession of shares  of stock<br><br>          having the value equal to the  purchase price plus the amount  of<br><br>          damages.   Thus, the damages awards for the stock options already<br><br>          represent the present  value of the stock options  at the date of<br><br>          judgment.  We conclude  that an award of prejudgment  interest is<br><br>          not  necessary   to  compensate  the  plaintiffs.     Although  a<br><br>          reasonable argument may  be made that prejudgment interest  is an<br><br><br>                                         -77-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          appropriate remedy for the loss of dividends that would have been<br><br>          paid to plaintiffs if  they had been in  possession of the  stock<br><br>          during  the period  to which  they were  entitled to  it, neither<br><br>          party has argued  this proposition.   Since both plaintiffs  have<br><br>          conceded either  explicitly (in Miller's case)  or implicitly (in<br><br>          Scarfo's case, to the extent she argues that prejudgment interest<br><br>          was not even awarded)  that prejudgment interest on the  value of<br><br>          the  stock options is not appropriate, we refrain from addressing<br><br>          the  argument  that  prejudgment   interest  may  be  awarded  as<br><br>          compensation for lost dividends.<br><br>                    Thus, defendants and plaintiffs agree  that prejudgment<br><br>          interest  was inappropriate on the damages  for stock options and<br><br>          we affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest on the<br><br>          stock options components of plaintiffs' Title VII awards.<br><br><br><br>                       XIV.   MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS\r                       XIV.   MILLER'S CHOICE OF DAMAGES AWARDS<br><br>                    The  orders   of  the  district  court   that  we  have<br><br>          determined to  be the functional  equivalent of a  final judgment<br><br>          are  silent,  and thus  perhaps  ambiguous, with  respect  to the<br><br>          effect of the  overlap between the judgment  for plaintiff Miller<br><br>          on  the jury  finding  of  damages  in  the  state  law  wrongful<br><br>          termination claim and  the judgment for  plaintiff Miller in  the<br><br>          court's findings of  damages in  the Title VII  claim.   Separate<br><br>          awards  were made  for these  two claims,  but nothing  is stated<br><br>          explicitly about whether and to what extent, and with what effect<br><br>          on collectibility,  the elements  of harm for  which damages  are<br><br><br>                                         -78-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          awarded under the two claims overlap.<br><br>                    None  of  the  parties   brought  this  matter  to  the<br><br>          attention of the trial court.  Each party may have been reluctant<br><br>          to  do so for fear  the ambiguity would  then be resolved against<br><br>          it.   Having chosen  instead to argue  their respective positions<br><br>          only  on appeal, however, no party  is in a favorable position to<br><br>          seek an award  of costs of appeal.   We award no costs  of appeal<br><br>          and cross-appeal  from the  judgment of the  district court  with<br><br>          respect to Miller's claims.<br><br>                    To    eliminate   any   uncertainty,   we   state   our<br><br>          determination  of   the  meaning   of  the  judgment,   with  the<br><br>          modifications we order.<br><br>                    Plaintiff Miller  prevailed on  two claims:   his state<br><br>          law  claim  for wrongful  discharge  against  Cabletron (and  not<br><br>          Benson) and his federal Title VII claim for retaliatory discharge<br><br>          against Cabletron and Benson.<br><br>                    Plaintiff Miller was awarded $995,000  with prejudgment<br><br>          interest at  a rate of 10% per annum  from the date of the filing<br><br>          of the  complaint to the date of the verdict (May 4, 1994) on his<br><br>          New Hampshire  state law  claim for wrongful  termination against<br><br>          Cabletron.<br><br>                    After modification  by this court, plaintiff  Miller is<br><br>          entitled  to three  types  of damages  for  his Title  VII  claim<br><br>          against  Cabletron and Benson.  First, Miller is entitled to back<br><br>          pay in the amount  of $190,651.85 (without prejudgment interest).<br><br>          Second,  Miller is  entitled to  damages  for front  pay (without<br><br><br>                                         -79-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          prejudgment  interest).

Appellants do challenge, however, the<br><br>          size of each award of attorneys'  fees on the ground that it does<br><br>          not account for plaintiff's failure to win at trial on all claims<br><br>          originally made.<br><br>                    Plaintiff  Scarfo   prevailed  on  her   claim  against<br><br>          Cabletron  and  Benson for  sex discrimination  and on  her claim<br><br>          against  Cabletron under the Equal Pay  Act.  She did not prevail<br><br>          on her  claim of sexual  harassment against Benson  or Cabletron.<br><br>          Her  claim  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress<br><br>          against Cabletron was dismissed,  and she lost on the  same claim<br><br>          against Benson  at trial.   Her claim  of breach of  contract was<br><br>          dismissed  on the ground of  res judicata.   The defamation claim<br><br>          was not pressed at trial, apparently because it was settled.<br><br>                    Miller prevailed against  Cabletron and  Benson on  his<br><br>          Title VII claim for  retaliatory discharge, and against Cabletron<br><br>          on  his state-law wrongful  termination claim.

The court awarded fees to<br><br>          Scarfo in the  amounts of  $225,300.13 for services  of the  firm<br><br>          that handled the bulk of her case and $18,955 for the services of<br><br>          a firm that  handled a small part of the case.  The court awarded<br><br>          fees to Miller in the amount of $117,510.97.<br><br>                    Appellants  assert  that  the  trial  court  improperly<br><br>          awarded Miller fees related to claims on which he did not prevail<br><br>          at trial -- apparently, the dismissed  claims of abuse of process<br><br>          and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Yet appellants<br><br>          have failed  to provide this  court with  a record from  which we<br><br>          could  determine   whether  the   award  included  the   cost  of<br><br>          prosecuting these claims.<br><br>                    It  is  clear from  the  trial  court's order  awarding<br><br>          attorneys' fees to Miller that the court had before it a detailed<br><br>          bill for Miller's attorneys' services.  Appellants have  not made<br><br>          that  bill,  or any  other  information sufficient  to  support a<br><br>          reasoned decision  by this  court, a part  of the  record.   This<br><br>          court therefore has no basis for determining whether there is any<br><br>          truth to appellants'  assertion that the  fee award against  them<br><br>          included  the cost of litigating  claims on which  Miller did not<br><br><br>                                         -82-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          prevail at trial.   In these circumstances,  we do not reach  the<br><br>          question whether  the trial  court abused  its discretion  in its<br><br>          award  of fees for the simple reason that  we have no basis for a<br><br>          reasoned decision.<br><br>                    When an appellant fails to provide a record of evidence<br><br>          material to the  point the  appellant wishes to  raise, and  thus<br><br>          leaves the appellate court  with an insufficient basis to  make a<br><br>          reasoned  decision,  the  court  in  its  discretion  may  either<br><br>          consider the merits of the case insofar as the record permits, or<br><br>          may dismiss the  appeal if the absence  of a full  record thwarts<br><br>          intelligent and reasoned review.

The support  for this assertion consists primarily  of a<br><br>          listing  of  the  claims on  which  plaintiffs  did  not prevail.<br><br>          Appellants cite a statement of the  trial court in a related case<br><br>          in  which the court acknowledged that the Title VII and state-law<br><br>          claims involved different defenses  and varying remedies, as well<br><br>          as  novel issues  of  state law.    Appellants also  assert  that<br><br>          plaintiffs  \"failed to  establish  entitlement to  the fees\"  and<br><br>          \"wholly  failed to explain many of the general entries which were<br><br>          made.\"<br><br>                    At the  hearing, the  trial court heard  testimony from<br><br>          Scarfo's lead  counsel regarding Scarfo's counsel  fees.  Counsel<br><br>          testified that the proffered  itemized bill did not  include work<br><br>          relating to the defamation  claim, or work solely related  to the<br><br><br>                                         -83-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          harassment  claim  or the  emotional  distress claim.

Counsel was<br><br>          subjected  to  fairly   detailed  cross-examination,   especially<br><br>          regarding the  fees attributable to the  sexual harassment claim;<br><br>          cross-examination on  that topic  focused especially on  fees for<br><br>          research undertaken on February 2 and February 5, 1993.<br><br>                    The court found that on these two dates, February 2 and<br><br>          5, 1993, research was undertaken on issues on which plaintiff did<br><br>          not prevail, but  that \"the  issues are interwoven.\"   The  court<br><br>          stated that it  was reducing  the charges allowed  for those  two<br><br>          days by 50% to $427.50.<br><br>                    An award of  fees under Title VII is reviewed primarily<br><br>          under an  abuse  of discretion  standard, and  the trial  court's<br><br>          range of  discretion is particularly broad.

We consider,  and<br><br>          reject, both possibilities.<br><br>                    Appellants  overstate their case  when they assert that<br><br>          the court  \"made no reduction  for counsel  fees as a  result\" of<br><br>          unsuccessful claims.  The  district court specifically found that<br><br>          on two  dates (February 2 and 5, 1993) research was undertaken on<br><br>          issues  on which plaintiffs did not prevail, but that \"the issues<br><br>          are  interwoven\";  the court  stated  that  it was  reducing  the<br><br>          charges allowed for those two days by 50%.<br><br>                    Although  we interpret the  statement that  \"the issues<br><br>          are interwoven\"  as having been  intended to  invoke the  Hensley\r                                                                    _______<br><br>          analysis, it is, to  be sure, not a sufficient explanation of the<br><br>          basis of  the  court's award  of fees  in a  case of  purportedly<br><br>          interrelated  claims.   It  falls  short  of  the  \"thorough  and<br><br>          detailed opinion reviewing the imbrication between the successful<br><br>          and  unsuccessful claims\" that  was before the  court in Lipsett,\r                                                                   _______<br><br>          975 F.2d at 941.  In the present case, the district court did not<br><br>          -- as far as we can tell  on the record before us -- \"make  clear<br><br>          that it considered the relationship between the amount of the fee<br><br>          awarded and the  result obtained.\"  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437.\r                                              ___ _______<br><br>          The  court's order  does not  reflect a  Hensley analysis  of the\r                                                   _______<br><br>          relationship among the claims; in fact, it does not indicate what<br><br>          issues  the court  has  determined to  be  interrelated, or  even<br><br>          whether they are issues of fact or law.<br><br>                    Nevertheless,  our review  of  the record  leads us  to<br><br><br>                                         -86-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          conclude   that  Scarfo's   claims  of   sexual  harassment   and<br><br>          intentional  infliction of  emotional distress  shared sufficient<br><br>          common  issues of fact with her successful claims under Title VII<br><br>          and the Equal Pay Act to justify the award made in this case.  In<br><br>          any event, we conclude that appellants should not now be heard on<br><br>          their request  for remand because they did not adequately present<br><br>          this issue  to the trial court  or in the briefs  filed with this<br><br>          court.<br><br>                    The trial court's  order, it is true,  does not address<br><br>          the nature of legal work performed by Scarfo's counsel beyond the<br><br>          research billed for February 2 and February 5, 1993.  But we will<br><br>          not  ourselves consider,  or  remand to  the  district court  for<br><br>          consideration  of,  a blanket  request  not  specific enough  for<br><br>          reasoned  evaluation of the  merits of  the request.   Appellants<br><br>          have failed to meet  their burden of production before  the trial<br><br>          court and their  burden of adequate  briefing before this  court.<br><br>          This  failure deprives both courts  of an opportunity  to make an<br><br>          intelligent and reasoned decision regarding the  segregability of<br><br>          fees  awarded for  any work  related to  losing claims  that took<br><br>          place on days other than February 2 and 5, 1993.<br><br>                    Parties must fulfill certain obligations of specificity<br><br>          of grounds of  claim or defense  if the district  court is to  be<br><br>          able to make a reasoned decision  as to a proper fee award.   The<br><br>          fee-seeker, for example, must provide  a \"particularized account\"<br><br>          of his or her claim for fees.  Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 527.

Appellants failed to meet this burden.\r          _______<br><br>                    There was  evidence before  the district court,  in the<br><br>          form of testimony by  Scarfo's counsel, that the requested  award<br><br>          already  reflected  a $75,000  deduction  from  overall costs  to<br><br>          account  for  time spent  solely  on  the  sexual harassment  and<br><br>          infliction  of emotional  distress claims;  the remainder  of her<br><br>          firm's work  on these claims, she testified,  was closely related<br><br>          to the claims on which her client  prevailed.  She also testified<br><br>          that  the award  did  not include  any  expenses related  to  the<br><br>          defamation  claim.    That  testimony  constituted  a  \"plausible<br><br>          assertion\" that counsel had already segregated fees to the extent<br><br>          practicable.   The credibility of that testimony is for the trial<br><br>          court, not this court, to determine.<br><br>                    The defendant  was free to challenge  this assertion by<br><br>          pointing  specifically to  segregable  aspects of  the bill  that<br><br>          formed  the  basis  for  the  award.    The  defendants'   cross-<br><br>          examination of  Scarfo's counsel  regarding  expenses billed  for<br><br>          February 2 and February  5 apparently convinced the judge  that a<br><br>          50% reduction in the  fees for those days was  warranted, despite<br><br>          his  conclusion  that  they  pertained  to  \"interwoven\"  issues.<br><br>          Perhaps  a  further  reduction in  fees  would  have  followed if<br><br>          defendants had  presented an adequate basis  for subjecting other<br><br>          billed  hours to judicial scrutiny.  But defendants did not point<br><br><br>                                         -88-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          to any other purportedly segregable entries in the bill submitted<br><br>          by  Scarfo,   either  during  cross-examination  or   in  written<br><br>          submissions contained in the record before us.<br><br>                    Appellants did not  even assert in the trial court that<br><br>          the award improperly included fees attributable to the defamation<br><br>          or breach of contract claims.<br><br>                    Plaintiffs' contentions  at trial and before this court<br><br>          regarding the segregability of other claims, moreover, are merely<br><br>          statements of conclusions.  The  written submissions to the trial<br><br>          court contained in the record before us merely stated conclusions<br><br>          that the  losing claims \"have  separate and distinct  elements of<br><br>          proof requiring different testimony and documentary evidence\"  or<br><br>          have   a  \"distinct   and  separate   nature\"  and   are  \"easily<br><br>          segregated.\"  Appellants' argument  of segregability on appeal is<br><br>          even less specific than  the arguments advanced before the  trial<br><br>          court.<br><br>                      In  these circumstances, in which we do not even know<br><br>          what arguments the  appellants would make on  remand because they<br><br>          have failed to make those arguments to the trial court  or to us,<br><br>          we  conclude that it would be improper to give appellants another<br><br>          bite at the apple.<br><br>                    Appellants  argue  to  us that  plaintiffs  \"failed  to<br><br>          establish entitlement to the fees\" and \"wholly  failed to explain<br><br>          many of the general entries which were made.\"  Even if we were to<br><br>          construe  these  assertions  as  arguments  independent   of  the<br><br>          arguments  regarding segregability of fees, they are no more than<br><br><br>                                         -89-\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          statements of the conclusion appellants ask us to reach.
