For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the motion will be granted.\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n        In the Northern District of Illinois, Guillermo Rivera (“plaintiff”) “pleaded guilty to four\n\ncounts of bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), and was sentenced to a total of 104 months’\n\nimprisonment.” United States v. Rivera, 338 F. App’x. 532, 533 (7th Cir. 2009).2 He is serving\n\nhis sentence in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). See Civil Complaint\n\n1\n         This unpublished memorandum opinion is intended solely to inform the parties and any\nreviewing court of the basis for the instant ruling, or alternatively, to assist in any potential future\nanalysis of the res judicata, law of the case, or preclusive effect of the ruling. The Court has\ndesignated this opinion as “not intended for publication,” but this Court cannot prevent or\nprohibit the publication of this opinion in the various and sundry electronic and legal databases\n(as it is a public document), and this Court cannot prevent or prohibit the citation of this opinion\nby counsel. Cf. Fed. R. App. P. 32.1. Nonetheless, as stated in the operational handbook\nadopted by our Court of Appeals, “counsel are reminded that the Court's decision to issue an\nunpublished disposition means that the Court sees no precedential value in that disposition.”\nD.C. Circuit Handbook of Practice and Internal Procedures 43 (2011).\n2\n         After having “embarked on a bank robbery spree” in Illinois, his “string of bank\nrobberies had continued in Indiana.” Rivera, 338 F. App’x at 533. “Indictments followed in\nboth the Northern District of Indiana and the Northern District of Illinois.” Id. “In July 2008, he\npleaded guilty in the Northern District of Illinois and, in October, was sentenced to 104 months.\nSeven months later, on the eve of trial in the Northern District of Indiana, he pleaded guilty to\nthree counts of bank robbery.” United States v. Rivera, 393 F. App’x 385, 385 (7th Cir. 2010).\n                                                    1 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n(“Compl.”) at 2 (page numbers designated by plaintiff).3 He brings this action against the\n\nUnited States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the BOP alleging that he has been “the victim\n\nof many civil rights violations while in custody, at the hands of a rogue Warden, who is\n\npermitted to operate outside of the law,” with respect to prisoners at the United States\n\nPenitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana (“USP Terre Haute”).4 Id.\n\n       Plaintiff allegedly was “blackballed and denied employment in every department of the\n\nprison,” id. at 5, and was denied “freedom of religious expression” when staff “confiscated [his]\n\ncrucifix[,] . . . Bible and other religious study guides.” Id. His civil rights allegedly were further\n\nviolated when staff confiscated legal materials and denied him access to the law library while\n\nplaintiff was involved in legal proceedings in an Indiana state court and a post-conviction\n\nchallenge to his sentences then pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\n\nCircuit.5 Id. at 5-6. Plaintiff also alleges that he was the victim of racism, in that prisoners at\n\nUSP Terre Haute are assigned cells based on race such that “Whites must be housed with Whites\n\n. . . Blacks must be housed with Blacks . . . Hispanics with Hispanics etc.” Id. at 6. While being\n\nescorted from a local hospital back to prison in July 2011, he was allowed to fall, “causing injury\n\nto his back, neck, and shoulder,” that he “[h]as been made to wear the same Dirty Clothing[] for\n\nweeks at a time” and that he “has gone without clean linens for a month or longer.” Id. at 7. He\n\n\n3\n       Plaintiff submitted his complaint on a five-page preprinted form to which he attached a\nhandwritten document titled “Civil Complaint.” Unless otherwise specified (“preprinted form”),\nreferences to the complaint are references to the handwritten Civil Complaint.\n4\n       Plaintiff since has been transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Coleman, Florida.\n5\n       The subject matter of the case before the Eleventh Circuit pertained to whether the\nsentences imposed by the Northern Districts of Illinois and Indiana were to run concurrently. The\nNorthern District of Indiana “clarified that the Indiana terms were to commence when Rivera\nwas sentenced in Indiana in May 2009, and run concurrently with the undischarged terms\nimposed in the Northern District of Illinois . . . .” United States v. Rivera, 478 F. App’x 328,\n329 (7th Cir. 2012).\n\n                                                   2 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nalso “has been kept in special housing as punishment for filing grievances,” and the BOP “has\n\nhad his grievances stalled over and over again, in an effort to discourage or confuse” him. Id. at\n\n8. For these alleged harms, “[p]laintiff seeks damages in the amount of[] $15,000,000.00\n\n(Fifteen Million Dollars) for mental and emotional duress, suffering and pain, for negligence and\n\ndiscrimination, inflicted upon his pe[r]son, while in the custody of the [DOJ] and the [BOP].” 6\n\nId. at 9. He also “demands an immediate release from custody.” Id.\n\n       The Court construes the complaint as one bringing constitutional tort claims against the\n\nUnited States demanding monetary damages for violations of the United States Constitution by\n\nBOP officials or employees. See Scurlock v. Lappin, 870 F. Supp. 2d 116, 119 (D.D.C. 2012)\n\n(characterizing prisoner’s complaint as “a Bivens-style action”).7 Defendants have filed a motion\n\nto dismiss under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction, improper venue, and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\nSee generally Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 5-15.8\n\n\n\n6\n        Plaintiff declares that, “should [he] pursue Class Action Status at a later date,” he may\nbring an action “for Civil Rights violations against other Inmates[].” Compl. at 9. As a lay\nperson, plaintiff cannot advance the claims of any other individual. See 28 U.S.C. § 1654 (“In all\ncourts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by\ncounsel . . . .”); Georgiades v. Martin–Trigona, 729 F.2d 831, 834 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (holding that\na lay person cannot appear as counsel for others); Oxendine v. Williams, 509 F.2d 1405, 1407\n(4th Cir. 1975) (“[I]t is plain error to permit this imprisoned litigant who is unassisted by counsel\nto represent his fellow inmates in a class action.”) (citation omitted). Nor is plaintiff qualified to\nrepresent the interests of other inmates in a class action. See Maldonado v. Terhune, 28 F. Supp.\n2d 284, 288 (D.N.J. 998) (quoting Caputo v. Fauver, 800 F. Supp. 168, 170 (D.N.J.\n1992), aff'd, 995 F.2d 216 (3d Cir. 1993)) (“Courts have consistently held that a prisoner\nacting pro se is inadequate to represent the interests of his fellow inmates in a class action.”)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n7\n        Under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388\n(1971), a plaintiff has “an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to\nhave violated [his] constitutional rights.” Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 66 (2001).\n8\n        Defendants assert that, because plaintiff is not incarcerated in this district, “venue is not\nlikely to be proper in the District of Columbia,” Defs.’ Mem. at 5, particularly absent a showing\nby plaintiff “of any compelling reason . . . or any interest in proceeding in the District of\n                                                   3 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n                                          II. DISCUSSION\n\n                                 A. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(1)\n\n       Subject matter jurisdiction is a requirement of Article III of the U.S. Constitution and by\n\nfederal statute. See Wilson v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 759 F. Supp. 2d 55, 62 (D.D.C. 2011). It is\n\nthe plaintiff’s burden to establish that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction. Lujan v.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). For purposes of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the\n\nCourt accepts the factual allegations of the complaint as true, and it “may consider materials\n\noutside the pleadings in deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.”\n\nJerome Stevens Pharm., Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n                    1. Plaintiff’s Claims for Damages Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n       Plaintiff identifies two defendants to this action -- the DOJ and the BOP -- and he relies\n\nsolely on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as the basis for this Court’s jurisdiction.9 See Compl. (preprinted\n\nform) at 1. Defendants move to dismiss the complaint on the ground that sovereign immunity\n\n\n\n\nColumbia,” id. at 6. They argue for dismissal of this action for improper venue or, alternatively,\nfor transfer of this action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,\nthe district where USP Terre Haute is located and where the events giving rise to the complaint\noccurred. Id. For purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the Court presumes that venue in this\ndistrict is proper and will dismiss the complaint on the basis of the other arguments defendants\nraise in their motion.\n9\n         In relevant part, Section 1983 provides:\n\n       Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\n       usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to\n       be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the\n       jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\n       secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\n       action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                                   4 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nbars plaintiff’s civil rights claims under § 1983 for monetary damages against these federal\n\nentities. See Defs.’ Mem. at 5, 11-12.\n\n        “It is elementary that the United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it\n\nconsents to be sued . . . , and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court’s\n\njurisdiction to entertain the suit.” United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586 (1941) (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted)); Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (“Absent a waiver,\n\nsovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.”). “To sustain a\n\nclaim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary damages, the waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U.S. 187,\n\n192 (1996) (citation omitted).\n\n\n        In his opposition, plaintiff barely mentions sovereign immunity, and instead argues that\n\nqualified immunity should not bar his claims. See Pl.’s Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss (“Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n”) at 10-11. He contends that court review of “conduct by prison officials under specific\n\nconstitutional provisions such as the Eighth Amendment . . . or general principles stemming from\n\nthe Due Process Clause” is available under § 1983. Id. at 10. A government official or\n\nemployee sued in his individual capacity “may, depending on his position, be able to assert\n\npersonal immunity defenses,” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985), such as qualified\n\nimmunity, see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982). When that official or employee is\n\nsued in his official capacity, or, as in this case, if a government entity is the defendant, a\n\nqualified immunity defense is unavailable. See Graham, 473 U.S. at 167.\n\n\n        Plaintiff identifies no provision by which the United States has waived its immunity with\n\nrespect to constitutional tort claims. Section 1983 does not apply to federal actors, Settles v. U.S.\n\n                                                   5 \n \n\f                                     SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                          NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nParole Comm’n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1104 (D.C. Cir. 2005), and “[d]efendants argue correctly that\n\nthe United States has not consented to be sued for monetary damages based on a constitutional\n\nviolation or, in other words, for a “‘Bivens-type cause of action directly against a federal\n\nagency.’” Mullen v. Bureau of Prisons, 843 F. Supp. 2d 112, 116 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Meyer,\n\n510 U.S. at 486). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, this Court lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims for money damages against the DOJ and the BOP. These\n\nclaims therefore must be dismissed. See, e.g., Jordan v. Quander, 882 F. Supp. 2d 88, 97\n\n(D.D.C. 2012); Bourdon v. Mabus, 813 F. Supp. 2d 200, 209 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\n\n     2. Plaintiff’s Claim Arising from the Confiscation of Religious and Personal Property10\n\n\n        Plaintiff alleges that staff at USP Terre Haute confiscated his crucifix, Bible, and\n\nreligious study guides. Compl. at 5. Insofar as plaintiff demands monetary compensation from\n\nthe United States for these actions, he must proceed under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(“FTCA”), which waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity, see United States v.\n\nMuniz, 374 U.S. 150, 158 (1963) (holding that, by enacting the FTCA, “Congress intended to\n\nwaive sovereign immunity in cases arising from prisoners’ claims”), and renders “[t]he United\n\nStates . . . liable . . . relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private\n\n\n\n10\n        Plaintiff invokes the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. §\n2000bb et seq., and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n(RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq., in his opposition to defendants’ motion, yet he alleges no\nviable claim under either statute. “[F]ederal courts have held that RLUIPA ‘only applies to state\nand local governments, not a federal prison,’” Garraway v. Lappin, No. 4:CV-10-1697, 2012\nWL 959422, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 21, 2012) (quoting Pineda-Morales v. De Rosa, No. 03-4247,\n2005 WL 1607276, at *4 (D.N.J. July 6, 2005)), and plaintiff’s bald assertion that his “freedom\nof religious expression came under attack because he openly displayed his cross,” Compl. at 5,\n“does not fall within the scope of the RFRA” absent a showing that “a substantial burden is\nplaced on his . . . ability to exercise” his religion. Garraway, 2012 WL 959422, at *7 (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                                    6 \n \n\f                                   SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                        NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nindividual under like circumstances . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 2674. There are limitations under and\n\nexceptions to the FTCA, however, which militate dismissal of plaintiff’s claim.\n\n\n       First, there is an exhaustion requirement:\n\n\n                      An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the\n               United States for money damages for injury or loss of property or\n               personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or\n               omission of any employee of the Government while acting within\n               the scope of his office or employment, unless the claimant shall\n               have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency\n               and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in\n               writing and sent by certified or registered mail.\n28 U.S.C. § 2675(a). “The FTCA bars claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they\n\nhave exhausted their administrative remedies,” and plaintiff’s apparent “fail[ure] to heed that\n\nclear statutory command” warrants dismissal of this claim. McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S.\n\n106, 113 (1993); see Henderson v. Ratner, No. 10-5035, 2010 WL 2574175, at *1 (D.C. Cir.\n\nJune 7, 2010) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of FTCA claim where “[a]ppellant failed to\n\ndemonstrate that he exhausted his administrative remedies before filing suit in the district\n\ncourt”); Hammond v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 740 F. Supp. 2d 105, 111 (D.D.C. 2010)\n\n(dismissing FTCA claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where plaintiff had not\n\n“established by a preponderance of the evidence that he administratively exhausted his FTCA\n\nclaim with the BOP before commending this action”).\n\n\n       Excluded from the FTCA is “[a]ny claim arising in respect of . . . the detention of any\n\ngoods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law\n\nenforcement officer.” 28 U.S.C. § 2680(c). “Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits against the\n\nUnited States for the unlawful detention of property by ‘any,’ not just ‘some,” law enforcement\n\nofficers,” including BOP officers. Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 228 (2008).\n\n\n                                                  7 \n \n\f                                     SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                          NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nInsofar as plaintiff demands damages arising from the confiscation of his crucifix, Bible,\n\nreligious materials and other personal property by BOP staff, the claim must be dismissed.\n\n\n                                      B. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\n\n        A plaintiff need only provide a “short and plain statement of [his] claim showing that\n\n[he] is entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), that “give[s] the defendant fair notice of what\n\nthe . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,” Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)\n\n(per curiam) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). A complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\n\nbe granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In considering such a motion, the “complaint is construed\n\nliberally in the plaintiff[’s] favor, and [the Court grants the plaintiff] the benefit of all inferences\n\nthat can be derived from the facts alleged.” Kowal v. MCI Commc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1994).\n\n        A complaint survives a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) only if it “contain[s] sufficient factual\n\nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual\n\ncontent that allows the [C]ourt to draw [a] reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for\n\nthe misconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). “[A] complaint [alleging]\n\nfacts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability . . . stops short of the line between\n\npossibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 557). Although a pro se complaint “must be held to less stringent\n\nstandards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,” Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted), it too, “must plead ‘factual matter’ that permits the court to infer\n\n\n\n                                                    8 \n \n\f                                     SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                          NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n‘more than the mere possibility of misconduct,’” Atherton v. District of Columbia Office of the\n\nMayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681-82 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79).\n\n                             1. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n        In relevant part, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) provides:\n\n                No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\n                section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner\n                confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such\n                administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Defendants move to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff failed to exhaust\n\nhis available administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit. See Defs.’ Mem. at 6-8.\n\n        The PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is mandatory and “applies to all prisoners seeking\n\nredress for prison circumstances or occurrences.” Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 520 (2002);\n\nsee Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007). Exhaustion under the PLRA requires proper\n\nexhaustion, meaning that a prisoner must comply with procedural rules, including filing\n\ndeadlines, as a precondition to filing a civil suit in federal court, regardless of the relief offered\n\nthrough the administrative process. See Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 85 (2006); Booth v.\n\nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 (2001). Thus, a prisoner may file a civil action concerning\n\nconditions of confinement under federal law only after he has exhausted the prison’s\n\nadministrative remedies. See Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d 262, 269 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2001). Exhaustion under the PLRA is not a jurisdictional requirement, however. See Jones, 549\n\nU.S. at 216; Woodford, 548 U.S. at 101. It is instead an affirmative defense, Jones, 549 U.S. at\n\n216, which “the defendants have the burden of pleading and proving.” Brengettcy v. Horton,\n\n423 F.3d 674, 682 (7th Cir. 2005) (quoting Dale v. Lappin, 376 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir. 2004)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir.) (holding\n\nthat “nonexhaustion under § 1997e(a) . . . does not impose a pleading requirement,” but “creates\n\n                                                    9 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \na defense [such that] defendants have the burden of raising and proving the absence of\n\nexhaustion”), cert. denied sub nom Alameida v. Wyatt, 540 U.S. 810 (2003).\n\n       The BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program is the means by which a federal inmate may\n\nseek “formal review of any grievance that relates to any aspect of [his] confinement.” Defs.’\n\nMem., Ex. A (“Albright Decl.”) ¶ 4. First, if the inmate has not successfully resolved the matter\n\ninformally, see 28 C.F.R. § 542.13, he may file a formal administrative remedy request at the\n\ninstitutional level to the Warden. See 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(a). If the inmate is not satisfied with\n\nthe Warden’s response, within 20 calendar days he may file an appeal to the Regional Director.\n\nSee 28 C.F.R. § 542.15(a). Finally, if the inmate is dissatisfied with the Regional Director’s\n\ndetermination, within 30 calendar days he may appeal to the General Counsel at BOP’s Central\n\nOffice. See id. “Appeal to the Central Office is the final administrative appeal in the BOP,” and\n\nan inmate’s “administrative remedy is finally exhausted when the BOP’s Central Office has\n\nissued its formal response . . . .” Albright Decl. ¶ 4.\n\n       According to the BOP’s declarant, “[p]laintiff has appealed a total of five . . .\n\nadministrative remedies to the Central Office.” Id. ¶ 5. Of these five administrative remedies,\n\ntwo appear to be related to the claims in the lawsuit: plaintiff alleged negligent medical care and\n\ntreatment (Remedy No. 665654-A1), and that “staff acted in an unsafe matter while escorting\n\nhim” (Remedy No. 650837-A1).11 Id. ¶ 6. Neither of these administrative remedies was\n\nexhausted prior to the filing of this lawsuit. Id. Defendants argue that, because plaintiff did not\n\nfollow the administrative remedy process through to the final appeal with respect to these two\n\nrequests, and because he did not file an administrative remedy request at all with respect to the\n\n\n\n\n11\n       The remaining three administrative remedies “are unrelated to the claims made in [this]\nlawsuit.” Defs.’ Mem., Albright Decl. ¶ 7.\n                                                  10 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nremaining claims alleged in the complaint prior to filing this lawsuit, his claims are subject to\n\ndismissal. See Defs.’ Mem. at 8.\n\n       According to plaintiff, he “initiated [grievances] through the counselor who was assigned\n\nby the Warden, but [the] Warden suppressed the filed grievance[s] in many cases and refused the\n\nfilings which were the most damaging to him.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 4. He further claimed that the\n\n“Warden was actively engaged in stonewalling, therefore, denying the plaintiff the right to us[e]\n\nthe Prison Litigation procedure.” Id. “Plaintiff exercised Due Diligence and made a good faith\n\neffort to solve all disputes by trying to use the grievance procedures as required by the Prison\n\nLitigation Reform Act,” id. at 6, and to this end has submitted his own affidavit listing\n\ngrievances he claims to have filed timely and were rejected. See Notice of Default [ECF No.\n\n20].\n\n       Exhaustion might be excused if, for example, “prison officials refuse to provide the\n\nrequired grievance forms upon request or ignore such a request,” Albino v, Baca, 697 F.3d 1023,\n\n1034 n.7 (9th Cir. 2012), or if the inmate receives “threats of retaliation for filing a grievance,”\n\nid. (citing Turner v. Burnside, 541 F.3d 1077, 1085 (11th Cir. 2008)). Plaintiff makes no such\n\nallegations here. Rather, he has concluded that the administrative grievance process is futile, see\n\nPl.’s Opp’n, Ex. (Affidavit dated January 30, 2012), but his assessment of the viability of the\n\nprocess does not render the process unavailable. See Booth, 532 U.S. at 741 n. 6 (finding that the\n\nCourt will not “read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where\n\nCongress has provided otherwise”); Jeanes v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 231 F. Supp. 2d 48, 51\n\n(D.D.C. 2002) (“The plaintiff's belief that availing himself of those grievance procedures is futile\n\nis not a sufficient reason for bypassing portions of the administrative remedy process.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n       Defendants demonstrate that plaintiff has failed to exhaust his available administrative\n\nremedies with respect to any of the matters set forth in his complaint, and their motion to dismiss\n\non this basis will be granted. Even if plaintiff had exhausted his administrative remedies, the\n\nclaims over which this court has subject matter jurisdiction still are subject to dismissal under\n\nRule 12(b)(6).\n\n                                            2. Retaliation\n\n       According to plaintiff, because of his use of the administrative remedy process in 2009\n\nregarding an “assault[] by a staff member who has a lengthy history of abusive behavior towards\n\ninmates,” the Warden at USP Terre Haute “began to retaliate creating a living horror, which has\n\nscar[re]d the plaintiff emotionally and psychologically.” Compl. at 4. The Court construes these\n\nstatements as an allegation of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment for plaintiff’s\n\nattempts to redress grievances. See Byrd v. Moseley, 942 F. Supp. 642, 644 (D.D.C. 1996)\n\n(construing plaintiff’s complaint “as a damages action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on the\n\ndefendants’ violation of the plaintiff's First Amendment rights by retaliating against him for\n\nfiling a previous lawsuit”).\n\n       “Within the prison context, a viable claim of First Amendment retaliation entails five\n\nbasic elements: (1) An assertion that a state actor took some adverse action against an inmate (2)\n\nbecause of (3) that prisoner’s protected conduct, and that such action (4) chilled the inmate’s\n\nexercise of his First Amendment rights, and (5) the action did not reasonably advance a\n\nlegitimate correctional goal.” Anderson-Bey v. District of Columbia, 466 F. Supp. 2d 51, 65\n\n(D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Rhodes v. Robinson, 408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation\n\nomitted)); see Garcia v. District of Columbia, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1998). The act of\n\nfiling an administrative grievance is an activity protected by the First Amendment. Garcia, 56 F.\n\n\n\n                                                  12 \n \n\f                                      SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                           NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nSupp. 2d at 6. “[P]rison officials may not retaliate against an inmate for exercising a\n\nconstitutionally protected right.” Adams v. James, 784 F.2d 1077, 1082 (11th Cir. 1986); see\n\nPryor-El v. Kelly, 892 F. Supp. 261, 274-75 (D.D.C. 1995) (alleging retaliation for having filed a\n\ncivil complaint).\n\n        Missing from plaintiff’s complaint is any mention of causation. See Mt. Healthy City\n\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 285-86 (1977). “To satisfy the causation link, a\n\nplaintiff must allege that his . . . constitutional speech was the ‘but for’ cause of the defendants’\n\nretaliatory action.” Aref v. Holder, 774 F. Supp. 2d 147, 169 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting Hartman v.\n\nMoore, 547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006)). Plaintiff not only bears the “burden . . . to show that his\n\nconduct was constitutionally protected,” but also to show “that this conduct was a ‘substantial\n\nfactor’ or to put it on other words, that it was a ‘motivating factor’” in defendants’ decision to act\n\nas they did. Doyle, 429 U.S. at 287. Plaintiff has not alleged, for example, “a chronology of\n\nevents which may be read as providing some support for an inference of retaliation.” McDonald\n\nv. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1979); see Conlon v. Coughlin, 58 F. 3d 865, 872 (2d Cir.\n\n1995) (finding that verified complaint’s allegations that plaintiff “filed two lawsuits complaining\n\nabout his conditions of confinement” followed by disciplinary charges which prevented his\n\nparticipation in a prison program). Absent allegations that the filing of his administrative\n\ngrievances was the motivating factor in the alleged acts of retaliation, his retaliation claim must\n\nbe dismissed. See, e.g., Mayo v. Fields, No. 1:10-CV-1607, 2010 WL 2723066, at *4 (N.D. Ga.\n\nJuly 8, 2010) (finding that complaint did not state a retaliation claim because it did not allege\n\nfacts showing a causal relationship between the protected speech and disciplinary reports against\n\nthe prisoner plaintiff).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    13 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n                                       3. Age Discrimination\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that he “was often called old man by staff,” and that, “when job openings\n\nbecame available, they were given to younger inmates [with] less seniority in the institution.”\n\nCompl. at 5. Defendants argue that this statement does not adequately allege discrimination\n\nbased on age. See Defs.’ Mem. at 10. The Court concurs. The allegations of the complaint are\n\nso vague, so conclusory, and so lacking in detail that the Court simply cannot “draw the\n\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678. Furthermore, as a federal prisoner, plaintiff has no protectable interest in prison\n\nemployment. See Garza v. Miller, 688 F.3d 480, 485 (7th Cir. 1982) (finding that federal\n\nprisoner has no “property or liberty interest in prison employment”), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1150\n\n(1983). Plaintiff sincerely may believe that defendants discriminated against him because of his\n\nage, but his belief without sufficient factual support does not survive defendants’ motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n                                       4. Access to the Courts\n\n       According to plaintiff, in 2011 he “was engaged in two very important court cases,” one\n\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the other in an Indiana state\n\ncourt regarding “the adoption of [plaintiff’s] seven year [old] son, Isaac.” Compl. at 5. “[T]he\n\nWarden and the Captain [allegedly] confiscated all the plaintiff[’]s legal documents, all legal\n\nmaterial pertinent to both cases, therefore, denying [him] access to the courts” and depriving him\n\n“of the ability to participate in these court proceedings.” Id. at 5-6. As a result of these actions,\n\nplaintiff alleged, “the adoption was completed, and the plaintiff will never be allowed to play a\n\nrole in his son[’]s life.” Id. at 6. He notes that the Eleventh Circuit “granted [him three]\n\nextensions,” id., but does not describe the outcome of those proceedings in his complaint.\n\n\n\n                                                  14 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n        An inmate has a First Amendment right of access to the courts that is adequate, effective,\n\nand meaningful. See Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821-22 (1977); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S.\n\n546, 549 (1941). It is not enough for an inmate to state in a conclusory fashion that he was\n\ndenied access to the courts; rather, he also must allege actual injury as a result of the denial in\n\nthat an actionable claim was rejected, lost, or prevented from being filed. See Lewis v. Casey,\n\n518 U.S. 343, 356 (1996) (stating that an inmate alleging violation of Bounds must show actual\n\ninjury, without which he has no standing to raise the claim). An “actual injury” is “actual\n\nprejudice with respect to contemplated or existing litigation, such as the inability to meet a filing\n\ndeadline or to present a claim.” Id. at 348 (citation and internal quotation omitted).\n\n        With respect to the adoption proceeding, plaintiff’s own exhibits indicate that he was\n\nrepresented by appointed counsel. See, e.g., Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. (Appearance Form). And it\n\nappears that counsel had been appointed to represent plaintiff on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit,\n\nthat “his . . . lawyer . . . concluded that the appeal is frivolous,” and that counsel sought to\n\nwithdraw from the case.12 United States v. Rivera, 478 F. App’x 328, 329 (7th Cir. 2012). It\n\ncannot be said that, under these circumstances “an actionable claim . . . which [plaintiff] desired\n\nto bring has been lost or rejected, or that the presentation of such a claim is currently being\n\nprevented.” Lewis, 518 U.S. at 356.\n\n                                       5. Race Discrimination\n\n        Plaintiff claims to have “experienced racism, which is rampant in the Terre Haute\n\nfacility.” Compl. at 6. According to plaintiff, cell assignments are made based on a prisoner’s\n\nrace. Id. He recounts an incident in 2010 during which Mexican prisoners were “corral[l]ed . . .\n\nin an isolated part of the prison, because of a gang related incident,” and remained separate and\n\n12\n       Appellate counsel’s motion to withdraw was granted, and the appeal was dismissed.\nRivera, 478 F. App’x at 330.\n                                                  15 \n \n\f                                     SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                          NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \non lockdown status for several months. Id. at 7. Plaintiff does not indicate whether he was\n\namong the inmates so separated, but he claims that “[n]o other group of inmates, Black or White,\n\nwould have been treated in this manner.” Id. The Court construes these assertions as alleging a\n\nviolation of plaintiff’s right to equal protection.\n\n        Defendants argue that, although “segregation of prisoners on the basis of race is\n\nprohibited,” allowances can be made “for the ‘necessities of prison security and discipline.’”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 13 (quoting Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333, 333 (1968) (per curiam)).13\n\nAlthough “prison authorities have the right, acting in good faith and in particularized\n\ncircumstances, to take into account racial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good\n\norder in prisons and jails,” Lee, 390 U.S. at 334 (Black, Harlan and Stewart, JJ, concurring), “[a]\n\ngeneralized expectation of racial violence is insufficient.” Mickens v. Winston, 462 F. Supp. 910,\n\n912 (E.D. Va. 1978). If, for example, defendants made cell assignments based on race in\n\nresponse to a specific threat of violence, or to further a compelling interest such as prison safety\n\nand security, race-based cell assignments may be permissible. See, e.g., Fisher v. Ellegood, 238\n\nF. App’x 428, 434 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding that “racial separation after receiving an inmate’s\n\ncomplaint that the white inmates in [plaintiff’s] cell block feared violence from the black inmates\n\nin that block” both furthered a compelling interest in prison safety and “was narrowly tailored to\n\nneutralize threat of violence”); Tooley v. Boyd, 936 F. Supp. 685, 689 (E.D. Mo. 1996) (rejecting\n\nequal protection claim of white inmate confined to administrative segregation unit after race riot\n\nwhere “an internal investigation . . . concluded that the riot was the result of racial tensions\n\nbetween certain white inmates and black inmates on the tier[,] . . . that the white inmates\n\n\n\n13\n     In Lee, the Supreme Court affirmed a ruling “that certain Alabama statutes violate the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the extent that they require segregation of the races in prisons and jails.” Lee, 390 U.S. at\n333.\n\n                                                      16 \n \n\f                                      SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                           NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \ninstigated the riot[,] and that plaintiff was one of the instigators and main participants in the\n\nriot”).\n\n          Plaintiff’s bald assertion of race discrimination is not sufficient as it lacks enough factual\n\nweight to push his equal protection claim “across the line from conceivable to plausible,”\n\nTwombly, 555 U.S. at 570), and it must be dismissed.\n\n                         6. Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical Needs\n\n          Plaintiff alleges that, after undergoing surgery at a local hospital, he “was allowed to fall\n\nby his escort/staff,” notwithstanding a doctor’s instructions “not to move the patient until the\n\nanesthesia wore off.” Id. at 7. His escorts allegedly “ignored the . . . orders, and the plaintiff\n\ncollapsed, causing injury to his back, neck, and shoulder.” Id. The Court construes these\n\nallegations as plaintiff’s attempt to claim “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,” so\n\nas to “constitute[] the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth\n\nAmendment.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “Essentially, the Estelle test is a two-pronged standard requiring both a serious\n\nmedical need evidenced by the prisoner and deliberate indifference on the part of the prison\n\nofficials.” Cox v. District of Columbia, 824 F. Supp. 439, 441 (D.D.C. 1992). There are too few\n\nfactual allegations from which the Court might conclude that plaintiff’s has a serious medical\n\nneed. And his claim does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation because there are no\n\nfactual allegations whatsoever to show that “prison officials have prevented [him] from receiving\n\nrecommended treatment or [have] denied [him] access to medical personnel capable of\n\nevaluating the need for treatment.” Id.

For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the motion will be granted.\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n        In the Northern District of Illinois, Guillermo Rivera (“plaintiff”) “pleaded guilty to four\n\ncounts of bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), and was sentenced to a total of 104 months’\n\nimprisonment.” United States v. Rivera, 338 F. App’x. 532, 533 (7th Cir. 2009).2 He is serving\n\nhis sentence in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). See Civil Complaint\n\n1\n         This unpublished memorandum opinion is intended solely to inform the parties and any\nreviewing court of the basis for the instant ruling, or alternatively, to assist in any potential future\nanalysis of the res judicata, law of the case, or preclusive effect of the ruling. The Court has\ndesignated this opinion as “not intended for publication,” but this Court cannot prevent or\nprohibit the publication of this opinion in the various and sundry electronic and legal databases\n(as it is a public document), and this Court cannot prevent or prohibit the citation of this opinion\nby counsel. Cf. Fed. R. App. P. 32.1. Nonetheless, as stated in the operational handbook\nadopted by our Court of Appeals, “counsel are reminded that the Court's decision to issue an\nunpublished disposition means that the Court sees no precedential value in that disposition.”\nD.C. Circuit Handbook of Practice and Internal Procedures 43 (2011).\n2\n         After having “embarked on a bank robbery spree” in Illinois, his “string of bank\nrobberies had continued in Indiana.” Rivera, 338 F. App’x at 533. “Indictments followed in\nboth the Northern District of Indiana and the Northern District of Illinois.” Id. “In July 2008, he\npleaded guilty in the Northern District of Illinois and, in October, was sentenced to 104 months.\nSeven months later, on the eve of trial in the Northern District of Indiana, he pleaded guilty to\nthree counts of bank robbery.” United States v. Rivera, 393 F. App’x 385, 385 (7th Cir. 2010).\n                                                    1 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n(“Compl.”) at 2 (page numbers designated by plaintiff).3 He brings this action against the\n\nUnited States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the BOP alleging that he has been “the victim\n\nof many civil rights violations while in custody, at the hands of a rogue Warden, who is\n\npermitted to operate outside of the law,” with respect to prisoners at the United States\n\nPenitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana (“USP Terre Haute”).4 Id.\n\n       Plaintiff allegedly was “blackballed and denied employment in every department of the\n\nprison,” id. at 5, and was denied “freedom of religious expression” when staff “confiscated [his]\n\ncrucifix[,] . . . Bible and other religious study guides.” Id. His civil rights allegedly were further\n\nviolated when staff confiscated legal materials and denied him access to the law library while\n\nplaintiff was involved in legal proceedings in an Indiana state court and a post-conviction\n\nchallenge to his sentences then pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\n\nCircuit.5 Id. at 5-6. Plaintiff also alleges that he was the victim of racism, in that prisoners at\n\nUSP Terre Haute are assigned cells based on race such that “Whites must be housed with Whites\n\n. . . Blacks must be housed with Blacks . . . Hispanics with Hispanics etc.” Id. at 6. While being\n\nescorted from a local hospital back to prison in July 2011, he was allowed to fall, “causing injury\n\nto his back, neck, and shoulder,” that he “[h]as been made to wear the same Dirty Clothing[] for\n\nweeks at a time” and that he “has gone without clean linens for a month or longer.” Id. at 7. He\n\n\n3\n       Plaintiff submitted his complaint on a five-page preprinted form to which he attached a\nhandwritten document titled “Civil Complaint.” Unless otherwise specified (“preprinted form”),\nreferences to the complaint are references to the handwritten Civil Complaint.\n4\n       Plaintiff since has been transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Coleman, Florida.\n5\n       The subject matter of the case before the Eleventh Circuit pertained to whether the\nsentences imposed by the Northern Districts of Illinois and Indiana were to run concurrently. The\nNorthern District of Indiana “clarified that the Indiana terms were to commence when Rivera\nwas sentenced in Indiana in May 2009, and run concurrently with the undischarged terms\nimposed in the Northern District of Illinois . . . .” United States v. Rivera, 478 F. App’x 328,\n329 (7th Cir. 2012).\n\n                                                   2 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \nalso “has been kept in special housing as punishment for filing grievances,” and the BOP “has\n\nhad his grievances stalled over and over again, in an effort to discourage or confuse” him. Id. at\n\n8. For these alleged harms, “[p]laintiff seeks damages in the amount of[] $15,000,000.00\n\n(Fifteen Million Dollars) for mental and emotional duress, suffering and pain, for negligence and\n\ndiscrimination, inflicted upon his pe[r]son, while in the custody of the [DOJ] and the [BOP].” 6\n\nId. at 9. He also “demands an immediate release from custody.” Id.\n\n       The Court construes the complaint as one bringing constitutional tort claims against the\n\nUnited States demanding monetary damages for violations of the United States Constitution by\n\nBOP officials or employees.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n        In relevant part, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) provides:\n\n                No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\n                section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner\n                confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such\n                administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). Defendants move to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff failed to exhaust\n\nhis available administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit.

Exhaustion under the PLRA requires proper\n\nexhaustion, meaning that a prisoner must comply with procedural rules, including filing\n\ndeadlines, as a precondition to filing a civil suit in federal court, regardless of the relief offered\n\nthrough the administrative process. See Woodford v.

A (“Albright Decl.”) ¶ 4. First, if the inmate has not successfully resolved the matter\n\ninformally, see 28 C.F.R. § 542.13, he may file a formal administrative remedy request at the\n\ninstitutional level to the Warden. See 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(a). If the inmate is not satisfied with\n\nthe Warden’s response, within 20 calendar days he may file an appeal to the Regional Director.\n\nSee 28 C.F.R. § 542.15(a). Finally, if the inmate is dissatisfied with the Regional Director’s\n\ndetermination, within 30 calendar days he may appeal to the General Counsel at BOP’s Central\n\nOffice. See id. “Appeal to the Central Office is the final administrative appeal in the BOP,” and\n\nan inmate’s “administrative remedy is finally exhausted when the BOP’s Central Office has\n\nissued its formal response . . . .” Albright Decl. ¶ 4.\n\n       According to the BOP’s declarant, “[p]laintiff has appealed a total of five . . .\n\nadministrative remedies to the Central Office.” Id. ¶ 5. Of these five administrative remedies,\n\ntwo appear to be related to the claims in the lawsuit: plaintiff alleged negligent medical care and\n\ntreatment (Remedy No. 665654-A1), and that “staff acted in an unsafe matter while escorting\n\nhim” (Remedy No. 650837-A1).11 Id. ¶ 6. Neither of these administrative remedies was\n\nexhausted prior to the filing of this lawsuit. Id.

Access to the Courts\n\n       According to plaintiff, in 2011 he “was engaged in two very important court cases,” one\n\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the other in an Indiana state\n\ncourt regarding “the adoption of [plaintiff’s] seven year [old] son, Isaac.” Compl. at 5. “[T]he\n\nWarden and the Captain [allegedly] confiscated all the plaintiff[’]s legal documents, all legal\n\nmaterial pertinent to both cases, therefore, denying [him] access to the courts” and depriving him\n\n“of the ability to participate in these court proceedings.” Id. at 5-6. As a result of these actions,\n\nplaintiff alleged, “the adoption was completed, and the plaintiff will never be allowed to play a\n\nrole in his son[’]s life.” Id. at 6. He notes that the Eleventh Circuit “granted [him three]\n\nextensions,” id., but does not describe the outcome of those proceedings in his complaint.\n\n\n\n                                                  14 \n \n\f                                    SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \n        An inmate has a First Amendment right of access to the courts that is adequate, effective,\n\nand meaningful. See Bounds v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109643\"><a href=\"/opinion/109643/bounds-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 821-22 (1977); Ex parte Hull, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103486\"><a href=\"/opinion/103486/ex-parte-hull/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (1941). It is not enough for an inmate to state in a conclusory fashion that he was\n\ndenied access to the courts; rather, he also must allege actual injury as a result of the denial in\n\nthat an actionable claim was rejected, lost, or prevented from being filed. See Lewis v. Casey,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (1996) (stating that an inmate alleging violation of Bounds must show actual\n\ninjury, without which he has no standing to raise the claim). An “actual injury” is “actual\n\nprejudice with respect to contemplated or existing litigation, such as the inability to meet a filing\n\ndeadline or to present a claim.” Id. at 348 (citation and internal quotation omitted).\n\n        With respect to the adoption proceeding, plaintiff’s own exhibits indicate that he was\n\nrepresented by appointed counsel. See, e.g., Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. (Appearance Form). And it\n\nappears that counsel had been appointed to represent plaintiff on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit,\n\nthat “his . . . lawyer . . . concluded that the appeal is frivolous,” and that counsel sought to\n\nwithdraw from the case.12 United States v. Rivera, 478 F. App’x 328, 329 (7th Cir. 2012). It\n\ncannot be said that, under these circumstances “an actionable claim . . . which [plaintiff] desired\n\nto bring has been lost or rejected, or that the presentation of such a claim is currently being\n\nprevented.” Lewis, 518 U.S. at 356.\n\n                                       5. Race Discrimination\n\n        Plaintiff claims to have “experienced racism, which is rampant in the Terre Haute\n\nfacility.” Compl. at 6. According to plaintiff, cell assignments are made based on a prisoner’s\n\nrace. Id. He recounts an incident in 2010 during which Mexican prisoners were “corral[l]ed . . .\n\nin an isolated part of the prison, because of a gang related incident,” and remained separate and\n\n12\n       Appellate counsel’s motion to withdraw was granted, and the appeal was dismissed.\nRivera, 478 F. App’x at 330.\n                                                  15 \n \n\f                                     SUMMARY MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                          NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTERS \n \non lockdown status for several months. Id. at 7. Plaintiff does not indicate whether he was\n\namong the inmates so separated, but he claims that “[n]o other group of inmates, Black or White,\n\nwould have been treated in this manner.” Id. The Court construes these assertions as alleging a\n\nviolation of plaintiff’s right to equal protection.\n\n        Defendants argue that, although “segregation of prisoners on the basis of race is\n\nprohibited,” allowances can be made “for the ‘necessities of prison security and discipline.’”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 13 (quoting Lee v.

If, for example, defendants made cell assignments based on race in\n\nresponse to a specific threat of violence, or to further a compelling interest such as prison safety\n\nand security, race-based cell assignments may be permissible. See, e.g., Fisher v. Ellegood, 238\n\nF. App’x 428, 434 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding that “racial separation after receiving an inmate’s\n\ncomplaint that the white inmates in [plaintiff’s] cell block feared violence from the black inmates\n\nin that block” both furthered a compelling interest in prison safety and “was narrowly tailored to\n\nneutralize threat of violence”); Tooley v. Boyd, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 (E.D.

Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical Needs\n\n          Plaintiff alleges that, after undergoing surgery at a local hospital, he “was allowed to fall\n\nby his escort/staff,” notwithstanding a doctor’s instructions “not to move the patient until the\n\nanesthesia wore off.” Id. at 7. His escorts allegedly “ignored the . . . orders, and the plaintiff\n\ncollapsed, causing injury to his back, neck, and shoulder.” Id. The Court construes these\n\nallegations as plaintiff’s attempt to claim “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,” so\n\nas to “constitute[] the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth\n\nAmendment.” Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (1976) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “Essentially, the Estelle test is a two-pronged standard requiring both a serious\n\nmedical need evidenced by the prisoner and deliberate indifference on the part of the prison\n\nofficials.” Cox v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (D.D.C. 1992). There are too few\n\nfactual allegations from which the Court might conclude that plaintiff’s has a serious medical\n\nneed. And his claim does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation because there are no\n\nfactual allegations whatsoever to show that “prison officials have prevented [him] from receiving\n\nrecommended treatment or [have] denied [him] access to medical personnel capable of\n\nevaluating the need for treatment.” Id.

CONCLUSION\n\n       The Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff’s Bivens-style\n\nclaims and his claim under the FTCA, and that the complaint fails to state any other claim upon\n\nwhich relief can be granted.
