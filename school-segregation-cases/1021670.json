Hall, a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institution (“FCI”) Fort Dix,\n\nappeals pro se from an order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241. Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will\n\nsummarily affirm the order of the District Court. See 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P 10.6.\n\nI.    Background\n\f       In February 2009, while Hall was incarcerated at FCI Schuylkill, prison officials\n\nconducted a routine shakedown of prison cells and found a cellular phone and charger\n\nhidden inside a desk light in Hall’s cell. Hall and his cellmate were questioned; Hall\n\nadmitted that the cellular phone and charger were his. A prison incident report was\n\nsubsequently issued, and Hall was charged with “[p]ossession, manufacture, or\n\nintroduction of a hazardous tool (Tools most likely to be used in an escape or escape\n\nattempt . . .; or those hazardous to institutional security . . .),” in violation of the Federal\n\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) Prohibited Acts Code (“PAC”) 108. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13\n\ntbl. 1 (2010).1 A disciplinary hearing was held. Based on Hall’s admission and a May\n\n2008 memorandum from the Warden to the inmate population,2 the disciplinary hearing\n\nofficer (“DHO”) found Hall guilty and imposed sanctions that consisted of 60 days of\n\ndisciplinary segregation, disallowance of 54 days of good conduct time, forfeiture of 270\n\ndays of non-vested good conduct time, loss of phone privileges for two years, loss of\n\nvisitation privileges for two years, loss of commissary privileges for 18 months, and\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       The current version of PAC 108 includes a portable telephone as an example of a\nhazardous tool. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.3 tbl. 1 (2011).\n       2\n          The May 2008 memorandum, which was a re-issuance of a memorandum dated\nOctober 28, 2005, informed the inmate population that an inmate found in possession of a\ncellular phone would be charged with a violation of PAC 108 because the Warden had\ndetermined that inmate possession of a cellular telephone poses a serious threat to\ninstitutional security.\n                                            2\n\fdisciplinary transfer. Hall sought administrative review of the decision, but his appeals\n\nwere denied.3\n\n       In May 2010, Hall filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, alleging\n\nthat his due process rights were violated because BOP failed to provide him with notice\n\nthat the punishment for his charged misconduct had been increased from a moderate\n\nseverity level to a greatest severity level violation and PAC 108 is void for vagueness.\n\nHe also alleged that his equal protection rights were violated. The District Court denied\n\nhis petition, and Hall timely appealed. Appellee has moved to summarily affirm.\n\nII.    Jurisdiction\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Hall properly brought his\n\nchallenge to the loss of good conduct time under § 2241, see Queen v. Miner, 530 F.3d\n\n253, 254 n.2 (3d Cir. 2008), and he need not obtain a certificate of appealability to\n\nproceed with this appeal, see United States v. Cepero, 224 F.3d 256, 264-65 (3d Cir.\n\n2000) (en banc). We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s legal conclusions\n\nand apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. Vega v. United States, 493\n\nF.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        It is unclear whether Hall exhausted the administrative remedies for all the\nclaims raised in his habeas petition.\n                                            3\n\fIII.   Discussion\n\n       A.     Due Process Claims\n\n       Hall argued that his due process rights were violated because he did not receive\n\nnotice that the penalty for possession of a cellular phone increased from a moderate\n\nseverity level violation under PAC 3054 to a greatest severity level violation under PAC\n\n108. Hall noted that a 2005 proposal to amend PAC 108 to explicitly refer to a cellular\n\nphone as a hazardous tool was not adopted. Therefore, he asserted that BOP lacked the\n\nauthority to charge him with a PAC 108 violation since BOP’s defining of a cellular\n\nphone as a hazardous tool under PAC 108 was not completed through the Administrative\n\nProcedures Act (“APA”).\n\n       We agree with the District Court and reject Hall’s argument. The APA requires\n\nthat general notice of the proposed regulation be published in the Federal Register and\n\nthat interested persons be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation. 5\n\nU.S.C. § 553; Chao v. Rothermel, 327 F.3d 223, 227 (3d Cir. 2003). The APA, however,\n\napplies only to legislative rules, which are rules that impose new duties upon the\n\nregulated party. See Chao, 327 F.3d at 227. The APA does not apply to PAC 108\n\nbecause PAC 108 is an interpretive rule. See id. (If the agency is not adding or amending\n\nlanguage to the regulation, the rule is interpretive). BOP acted within its authority in\n\n\n\n       4\n         PAC 305 prohibits the “[p]ossession of anything not authorized for retention or\nreceipt by the inmate, and not issued to him through regular channels.” 28 C.F.R. §\n541.13 tbl. 1 (2010).\n                                             4\n\finterpreting PAC 108, and Hall has not shown that BOP’s interpretation that a cellular\n\nphone is a hazardous tool is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with PAC 108. See Chong\n\nv. Dist. Dir., Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 264 F.3d 378, 389 (3d Cir. 2001) (“An\n\nagency’s interpretation of its own regulation is controlling . . . unless it is plainly\n\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.”)\n\n       Hall also argued that his due process rights were violated because PAC 108 is void\n\nfor vagueness. The District Court properly determined that this argument is meritless. A\n\nregulation is void for vagueness if it (1) “fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a\n\nreasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,” or (2) “authorizes or\n\neven encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S.\n\n703, 732 (2000). We are not persuaded that PAC 108 is unconstitutionally vague. It is\n\nclear what the regulation as a whole prohibits, which limits the possibility of arbitrary\n\nand discriminatory application. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-10\n\n(1972). One can readily infer from the language of PAC 108 that a cellular phone would\n\nbe among those tools “likely to be used in an escape or escape attempt,” or otherwise\n\n“hazardous to institutional security.” Accordingly, Hall’s void for vagueness claim fails.\n\n       B.     Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Hall argued that he has been treated differently from other inmates in similar\n\nsituations in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. He claimed that prison officials\n\ncharge inmates with a PAC 108 or PAC 305 violation depending on whether they like or\n\ndislike the inmate. Hall alleged that three other inmates originally charged with violating\n                                               5\n\fPAC 108 had their charges downgraded to violating PAC 305.5 The District Court\n\nproperly rejected this claim.\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause requires that all people similarly situated be treated\n\nalike. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). “To\n\nbring a successful claim . . . for a denial of equal protection, [a] plaintiff[] must prove the\n\nexistence of purposeful discrimination.” Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of\n\nPhila. Bd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176, 196 (3d Cir. 2009). This requires Hall to demonstrate\n\nthat he received different treatment from that received by other individuals similarly\n\nsituated. See id. at 196-97. Although Hall claimed that there were three inmates that\n\nreceived a lesser sanction for the same disciplinary infraction, he failed to show that the\n\nthree inmates were otherwise similarly situated. Moreover, Hall admitted to the offense\n\nand was sanctioned in conformity with the regulation. Hall therefore fails to show that\n\nhis sanction was motivated with a discriminatory purpose. Accordingly, his equal\n\nprotection claim fails.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         In his notice of appeal, Hall explains he was treated differently than the three\ninmates who had their charges downgraded because the three inmates are Caucasian and\nhe is African-American. We cannot consider this argument because it was not initially\npresented to the District Court. See Lloyd v. HOVENSA, LLC, 369 F.3d 263, 272-73\n(3d Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).\n\n                                               6\n\f",

Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (2000). We are not persuaded that PAC 108 is unconstitutionally vague. It is\n\nclear what the regulation as a whole prohibits, which limits the possibility of arbitrary\n\nand discriminatory application. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108-10\n\n(1972). One can readily infer from the language of PAC 108 that a cellular phone would\n\nbe among those tools “likely to be used in an escape or escape attempt,” or otherwise\n\n“hazardous to institutional security.” Accordingly, Hall’s void for vagueness claim fails.\n\n       B.     Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Hall argued that he has been treated differently from other inmates in similar\n\nsituations in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. He claimed that prison officials\n\ncharge inmates with a PAC 108 or PAC 305 violation depending on whether they like or\n\ndislike the inmate. Hall alleged that three other inmates originally charged with violating\n                                               5\n\fPAC 108 had their charges downgraded to violating PAC 305.5 The District Court\n\nproperly rejected this claim.\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause requires that all people similarly situated be treated\n\nalike. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (1985). “To\n\nbring a successful claim . . . for a denial of equal protection, [a] plaintiff[] must prove the\n\nexistence of purposeful discrimination.” Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of\n\nPhila. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345549\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345549/chambers-v-school-dist-philadelphia-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (3d Cir. 2009). This requires Hall to demonstrate\n\nthat he received different treatment from that received by other individuals similarly\n\nsituated. See id. at 196-97. Although Hall claimed that there were three inmates that\n\nreceived a lesser sanction for the same disciplinary infraction, he failed to show that the\n\nthree inmates were otherwise similarly situated. Moreover, Hall admitted to the offense\n\nand was sanctioned in conformity with the regulation. Hall therefore fails to show that\n\nhis sanction was motivated with a discriminatory purpose. Accordingly, his equal\n\nprotection claim fails.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         In his notice of appeal, Hall explains he was treated differently than the three\ninmates who had their charges downgraded because the three inmates are Caucasian and\nhe is African-American. We cannot consider this argument because it was not initially\npresented to the District Court. See Lloyd v. HOVENSA, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786329\"><a href=\"/opinion/786329/bruno-lloyd-v-hovensa-llc-wyatt-vi-inc-bruno-lloyd-v-hovensa-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272-73\n(3d Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).\n\n                                               6\n\f</pre>",
