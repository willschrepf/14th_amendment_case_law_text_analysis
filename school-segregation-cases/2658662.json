In two thoughtful opinions,\nJudge Kavanaugh, and Judge Brown joined by Judge\nHenderson, dissent from that denial. The panel’s opinion\nspeaks at length to the issues they take up. The panel\nmembers write further only to underscore why our court’s\napproach accords with the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).\n\n     The dissenters and we agree that the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act provides robust protection for religious\nliberty—without regard to whether others might view an\nadherent’s beliefs or practices as irrational, trivial, or wrong.\nNothing in our opinion should be seen to detract from that\nvital guarantee. Where we part ways is that the dissenters\nperceive in Hobby Lobby a potentially sweeping, new RFRA\nprerogative for religious adherents to make substantial-burden\nclaims based on sincere but erroneous assertions about how\nfederal law works. They believe we ignored that prerogative\nhere. The dissenters read more into the Supreme Court’s\ndecision than it supports. Hobby Lobby embraced adherents’\nclaim about the religious meaning of the undisputed operation\nof a federal regulation; this case involves a claim that courts\nmust credit religious adherents’ incorrect assertions about\nhow a different federal regulation operates. Because Hobby\nLobby did not address that distinct issue, we see no conflict.\n\n     The Court in Hobby Lobby invalidated the requirement\nthat closely-held, for-profit businesses with religious\nobjections to contraception nonetheless must buy health-\ninsurance coverage for their employees that pays for\ncontraception, or else face taxes or penalties. 134 S. Ct. at\n2759. No opt out was available to those businesses. The\nparties in Hobby Lobby did not dispute what the law required,\nnor its practical effects: All agreed that the Affordable Care\n\f                               2\nAct regulations mandated that employer-sponsored health\nplans include contraception, and that as a result plaintiffs’\nemployees got access to contraception paid for, in part, by\ntheir employers. See id. at 2762. What the parties in Hobby\nLobby contested were the moral and religious implications of\nthe businesses’ conceded role. The plaintiff business owners\nbelieved that “providing the coverage demanded . . . is\nconnected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is\nsufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the\ncoverage.”     Id. at 2778.      The government disagreed,\ncontending that employees’ intervening choices whether to\nuse contraception broke the chain of moral culpability, and\nhence the law did not substantially burden the businesses’\nreligious exercise. Id. at 2777-78.\n\n     In rejecting the government’s position in Hobby Lobby,\nthe Supreme Court emphasized that courts may not second-\nguess religious beliefs about the wrongfulness of facilitating\nanother person’s immoral act. Id. at 2778. RFRA forbids\ncourts from “provid[ing] a binding national answer to . . .\nreligious and philosophical question[s]” or “tell[ing] the\nplaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.” Id.; see also id. at\n2779 (“[I]t is not for us to say that [plaintiffs’] religious\nbeliefs are mistaken or insubstantial. Instead, our ‘narrow\nfunction in this context is to determine’ whether the line\ndrawn reflects ‘an honest conviction.’” (alteration marks\nomitted) (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 716\n(1981))). The context makes clear that the Court’s discussion\nof facilitation simply restates the basic tenet of the religious\nfreedom cases that judges may not question the correctness of\na plaintiff’s religious beliefs.\n\n     That reasoning is inapplicable here. The dispute between\nthe government and the Plaintiffs in this case, unlike in Hobby\nLobby, is not about religious implications of acknowledged—\n\f                                 3\nbut perhaps attenuated—support for contraceptive use; the\nparties disagree here about how the law functions, and\ntherefore whether there is any causal connection at all\nbetween employers’ opt-out notice and employees’ access to\ncontraception. Plaintiffs challenge the accommodation, not\navailable in Hobby Lobby, based on their assertion that what\ncauses their employees to receive contraceptive coverage is\ntheir compliance with the accommodation’s precondition that\nthey give notice of their sincere religious objections to such\ncoverage. As Plaintiffs characterize it, their act of excusing\nthemselves from legal liability for not providing contraceptive\ncoverage is what made such coverage available to employees,\nand hence violated their Catholic faith.\n\n     We held that Plaintiffs miscast the accommodation. The\nregulation allows Plaintiffs to continue to do just what they\ndid before the ACA: notify their insurers of their sincere\nreligious objection to contraception, and arrange for\ncontraception to be excluded from the health insurance\ncoverage they provide.1 As before, insurers may sell plans\n\n1\n   Judge Kavanaugh is perplexed as to why, if not for an\nimpermissible reason, the government requires any form at all.\nKavanaugh Dissent at 12-13 & n.5. The form is far from\n“meaningless,” id., because it acts as “the written equivalent of\nraising a hand in response to the government’s query as to which\nreligious organizations want to opt out,” and extricates those\nobjectors in a manner consistent with the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement. Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\nServs., 772 F.3d 229, 250 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Only once an insurer\nbecomes aware of the employer’s religious objection can it take the\nsteps needed to effectuate the opt out, such as: exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the employer’s group health plan,\nprevent the employer’s payment from funding contraception, notify\nthe beneficiaries that the employer plays no role in administering or\n\f                                 4\nthat exclude contraception to their religious-nonprofit\ncustomers. The difference is that now the ACA and its\nregulations require that contraceptive coverage be provided to\nall insured women. In the case of women who get their\ninsurance coverage through an accommodated employer, the\nlaw requires insurers to offer the women contraception under\na separate plan—completely segregated from the objecting\nemployer’s plan and its payments.\n\n     The judges who urge us to rehear the case say that Hobby\nLobby leaves no room for us to question Plaintiffs’\ncharacterization of how the challenged regulations operate,\nincluding their assertions that the regulations force Plaintiffs\nto facilitate the provision of contraception. As they read it,\nHobby Lobby forbids a court deciding a claim under RFRA to\nassess whether a plaintiff’s belief about what a law requires\nhim to do is correct. See, e.g., Kavanaugh Dissent at 8-11;\nBrown Dissent at 10-12. Both dissents argue that Hobby\nLobby’s discussion of facilitation requires us simply to accept\n\n\nfunding contraceptive coverage, and arrange for separate mailings\nand accounting.       Id. (citing regulatory provisions).      Judge\nKavanaugh would hold that including the insurer’s identity in the\nform is unnecessarily restrictive of religious exercise because,\nextending our metaphor, he says it requires the objecting employer\n“both to raise its hand and to point to its insurer.” Kavanaugh\nDissent at 24 n.11. But it is more apt to say that, if the employer\nopts to raise its hand where the insurer cannot see it (i.e. via the\nalternative notice delivered to the government rather than the\ninsurer, see 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)), the government must be in a position promptly to\ncommunicate the religious objection to the insurer, or else the\nemployer’s insurance plan will continue to include contraceptive\ncoverage. An insurer that is kept in the dark about an employer’s\nreligious objections cannot do what it must to honor the opt out.\n\f                              5\nwhatever beliefs a RFRA plaintiff avows—even erroneous\nbeliefs about what a challenged regulation actually requires.\n\n     Neither the holding nor the reasoning of Hobby Lobby\nmade that leap. RFRA understandably accorded Hobby\nLobby Stores a victory in a contest over what religious\nmeaning to ascribe to the Stores’ payment for contraceptive\ncoverage. That holding does not require us to credit Priests\nfor Life’s legally inaccurate assertions about the operation of\nthe regulation they challenge. See Univ. of Notre Dame v.\nBurwell, No. 13-3853, slip op. at 11, 15 (7th Cir. May 19,\n2015); see also id. at 34 (Hamilton, J., concurring). But see\nid. at 44-46 (Flaum, J., dissenting). Our panel opinion\nexplains that it is the mandate on insurers that causes\nPlaintiffs’ employees to receive contraceptive coverage, and\nnot anything Plaintiffs are required to do in claiming their\naccommodation. The panel thus held that Plaintiffs suffered\nno substantial burden triggering RFRA strict scrutiny.\n\n     The dispute we resolved is legal, not religious. Under the\nACA regulations, a woman who obtains health insurance\ncoverage through her employer is no more entitled to\ncontraceptive coverage if her employer submits the disputed\nnotice than if it does not. The ACA obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to all insured women does not depend\non that notice. Nothing in RFRA requires that we accept\nPlaintiffs’ assertions to the contrary.\n\n     RFRA protects religious exercise. In no respect do we,\nnor could we, question Plaintiffs’ sincere beliefs about what\ntheir faith permits and forbids of them. But we can and must\ndecide which party is right about how the law works. We\nconcluded that the regulation challenged in this case does not,\nas a matter of law or fact, give Plaintiffs’ conduct the\ncontraception-facilitating effect of which they complain.\n\f                               6\nIndeed, it bears emphasis that the whole point of the\nchallenged regulation is to scrupulously shield objecting\nreligious nonprofits from any role in making contraception\navailable to women. The accommodation is itself evidence of\nthe fundamental commitment of this Nation to religious\nfreedom that RFRA embodies. The regulation is, of course,\nproperly subject to judicial scrutiny to verify that it comports\nwith governing law, including Hobby Lobby. Because we\nconclude that it does, we believe that en banc review is not\nwarranted in this case.\n\f    BROWN, Circuit Judge, with whom HENDERSON, Circuit\nJudge, joins, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\nThe French say: plus ça change et plus c'est la même chose.\nThe more things change; the more they remain the same.\nThere was once a time when the church was the state and the\nchurch as the state embodied all hope of human well-being.\nR.W. SOUTHERN, WESTERN SOCIETY AND THE CHURCH IN THE\nMIDDLE AGES 23 (1970). To challenge the church was to\nundermine civilization. Thus, the imposition of orthodoxy\nwas deemed necessary, and dissent, which amounted to\nheresy, was met with coercion and violence. See ST. THOMAS\nAQUINAS, SUMMA THEOLOGIÆ pt. II-II, q. 11, art. 3.\n\n     This history prompted John Locke to urge toleration and\nstress the necessity of distinguishing “the business of civil\ngovernment from that of religion” and establishing clear\nboundaries between them. John Locke, A Letter Concerning\nToleration, reprinted in 5 THE WORKS OF JOHN LOCKE 5, 9\n(12th ed. 1824). The Framers went further, establishing not\nonly a limited government, but recognizing the primacy of\nindividual conscience and seeking the line between freedom\nand justice. Thus, the Bill of Rights “grew in soil which also\nproduced a philosophy that . . . liberty was attainable through\nmere absence of governmental restraints, and that government\nshould be entrusted with few controls and only the mildest\nsupervision over men’s affairs.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v.\nBarnette, 319 U.S. 624, 639–40 (1943).              The federal\ngovernment was given no authority over men’s souls. For the\nFounders, the not-so-distant history of persecution\nengendered a fierce commitment to each individual’s natural\nand inalienable right to believe according to his “conviction\nand conscience” and to exercise his religion “as these may\ndictate.” James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance\nAgainst Religious Assessments, reprinted in 2 WRITINGS OF\nJAMES MADISON 183, 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). “If there is any\nfixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no\nofficial, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in\n\f                               2\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or\nforce citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”\nBarnette, 319 U.S. at 642.\n\n     Of course, the right to freely exercise one’s religion is\nnot—and was not intended to be—absolute. The Founders\nrecognized state coercion would at times be necessary, with\nMadison himself stating “full and free exercise . . . according\nto the dictates of conscience” could be limited where “the\npreservation of equal liberty . . . and the existence of the\n[government] may be manifestly endangered.” G. Hunt,\nMadison and Religious Liberty, 1 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE\nAMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION, H.R. Doc. No. 702,\n57th Cong., 1st Sess., 163, 166–67 (1901). However, “[t]he\nessence of all that has been said and written on the subject is\nthat only those interests of the highest order . . . can\noverbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.”\nWisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215 (1972).\n\n     The soil of the eighteenth century has eroded and that\nfixed star grown surprisingly dim. We live in a time where\nprogress is sought “through expanded and strengthened\ngovernmental controls.” Barnette, 319 U.S. at 640. In a\nsense the government now fills the role formerly occupied by\nthe church, embodying the hope of human well-being. For\nthe government to pursue the good and to solve society’s\nproblems, it must first identify that which is good and that\nwhich is problematic through subjective and value-laden\njudgments.      Cf. Laurence H. Tribe, Disentangling\nSymmetries: Speech, Association, Parenthood, 28 PEPP. L.\nREV. 641, 651–53 (2001) (stating that when the government\ntakes a side in a “direct clash of competing images of ‘the\ngood life,’” it “is making an intrinsically contestable\nstatement about the rightness or wrongness” of ideals).\nConsequently, orthodoxy has been rehabilitated, and dissent\n\f                               3\nfrom the government’s determinations may be quelled\nthrough coercion—onerous fines or banishment from\ncommerce and the public square.\n\n     Despite the parallels, we do not find ourselves full circle\nquite yet. Religious adherents may still seek refuge from\nunnecessary governmental coercion through the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”). When the federal\ngovernment substantially burdens free exercise, it may do so\nonly in pursuit of a compelling interest and even then must\nuse the least restrictive means. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\nFurther, the conscience of the individual remains protected in\nthat he must “answer to no man for the verity of his religious\nviews.” United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 87 (1944).\nBut, in our respectful view, the panel in this case failed to\napply these protections. The panel conceded Plaintiffs\nsincerely “believe that the regulatory framework makes them\ncomplicit in the provision of contraception,” Slip Op. at 27\n(quoting Mich. Catholic Conf. v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372, 385\n(6th Cir. 2014), vacated and remanded, No. 14-701, 2015 WL\n1879768, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 27, 2015)). That acknowledgement\nshould end our inquiry into the substance of their beliefs.\nViewed objectively, Plaintiffs’ belief that the acts the\nregulations compel them to perform would facilitate access to\ncontraception in a manner that violates the teachings of their\nChurch may “seem incredible, if not preposterous,” to some\npeople. Ballard, 322 U.S. at 87. However, this Court is\nneither qualified nor authorized to so scrutinize any religious\nbelief. The panel trespassed into an area of inquiry Supreme\nCourt precedent forecloses. It then proceeded to accept\nevidence that is insufficient under the rulings of the Supreme\nCourt to find the purported compelling interest. For these\nreasons we believe this exceptionally important case is worthy\nof en banc review.\n\f                              4\n                               I\n\n     We begin by addressing the panel’s opening observations\nand by making some of our own with the hopes of\ndistinguishing between fact and fancy. First, this case is not\nabout denying any woman access to contraception. A\nwoman’s right to obtain and use contraception was recognized\nlong ago, and nothing about this case calls for the issue to be\nrevisited. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965).\n\n     Second, this case is about the religious freedom of these\nreligiously-affiliated organizations and not about the free\nexercise concerns of the plaintiffs in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby\nStores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). In that case, the\nSupreme Court found the Department of Health and Human\nServices’ (“HHS”) approach to religious nonprofits\ndemonstrated there were less restrictive means available to\ndeal with conscientious objectors among for-profit\ncorporations. Id. at 2781–82. The Court expressly reserved\njudgment on whether HHS’s approach “complies with RFRA\nfor purposes of all religious claims.” Id. at 2782. While the\ngovernment’s approach to religious non-profits may—or may\nnot—fully put to rest the Hobby Lobby plaintiffs’ religious\nobjections, that is irrelevant to our consideration of the\nreligious objections put forth by Plaintiffs in this case. The\npresent Plaintiffs are entitled to their own personal beliefs.\n\n     Third, this case is not “paradoxical” because Plaintiffs\nobject to regulatory requirements the government intended as\na religious accommodation. Slip Op. at 24 (quoting Univ. of\nNotre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547, 557 (7th Cir. 2014),\nvacated and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015)). That the\ngovernment’s expressed intent in enacting the regulations at\nissue was to allay religious adherents’ concerns about the\ncontraception mandate is not determinative of the ultimate\n\f                                5\nquestion of whether Plaintiffs were in fact accommodated.\nWhere the government imposes a substantial burden on\nreligious exercise and labels it an “accommodation,” that\nburden is surely as distressing to adherents as it would be if\nimposed without such a designation. Therefore, heightened\nskepticism is not appropriate. We should look at Plaintiffs’\nclaims as we would any RFRA claim. After all, in the\nsubstantial burden analysis, the government’s motivations—\nno matter how benevolent—are irrelevant; we ask only\nwhether the government’s action operates to place\n“substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior\nand to violate his beliefs.” Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S.\n707, 718 (1981).\n\n     Fourth, this case is not one in which Plaintiffs’ “only\nharm . . . is that they sincerely feel aggrieved by their inability\nto prevent what other people would do to fulfill regulatory\nobjectives after they opt out.” Slip Op. at 24. The regulations\ncompel Plaintiffs to take actions they believe would amount\nto “impermissibly facilitating access to abortion-inducing\nproducts, contraceptives, and sterilization” in violation of\ntheir religious tenets. Pet. for Reh’g En Banc at 1. Make no\nmistake: the harm Plaintiffs complain of—and the harm this\nCourt therefore is called to assess—is from their inability to\nconform their own actions and inactions to their religious\nbeliefs without facing massive penalties from the government.\n\n                                II\n\n    The panel’s substantial burden analysis is inconsistent\nwith the precedent of the Supreme Court and this Court,\nwhich identifies both permissible and impermissible lines of\ninquiry in the substantial burden analysis of a RFRA claim.\n\f                               6\n                               A\n\n     As we have recognized, whether a burden is “substantial”\nfor purposes of RFRA is a question of law for the court to\nanswer, not a “question[] of fact, proven by the credibility of\nthe claimant.” Mahoney v. Doe, 642 F.3d 1112, 1121 (D.C.\nCir. 2011). Relying on longstanding precedent, the Supreme\nCourt recently described permissible lines of inquiry for a\ncourt to pursue in determining whether an adherent’s religious\nexercise has been substantially burdened, both in Hobby\nLobby and in Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853 (2015), a case\ninvolving the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. §2000cc et seq, (RLUIPA).1\nThe plaintiff bears ‘the initial burden of proving [the law or\nregulation at issue] implicates his religious exercise.” Holt,\n135 S. Ct. at 862. While RFRA forecloses asking whether the\nexercise is “compelled by, or central to, a system of religious\nbelief,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A), the court does ask\nwhether the plaintiff’s beliefs are sincere. The answer is no if\nhis claims are not “sincerely based on a religious belief” but\ninstead on “some other motivation.” Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862;\nsee also Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774 n.28 (“To qualify\nfor RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be ‘sincere.’”).\n\n     Next, the plaintiff bears the “burden of proving that the\n[law or regulation] substantially burden[s] that exercise of\nreligion.” Holt, 135 S.

The court asks whether he\nhas been “put[] to th[e] choice” of either “‘engag[ing] in\nconduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs” or\n\n1\n  RLUIPA “targets two areas of state and local action: land use\nregulation, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc (RLUIPA § 2), and restrictions on\nthe religious exercise of institutionalized persons, § 2000cc–1\n(RLUIPA § 3).” Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651, 1656 (2011).\nIt “borrows important elements from RFRA . . . but is less\nsweeping in scope.” Id.\n\f                                7\nfacing “serious” consequences. Id. (quoting Hobby Lobby,\n134 S. Ct. at 2775); see also Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718 (stating\na substantial burden exists when the government places\n“substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior\nand to violate his beliefs”). The answer is no if the plaintiff\ncan identify “no [compelled] action or forbearance on his\npart.” Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 679 (plaintiff objecting to\nthe government’s extraction of DNA information from fluid\nor tissue samples but not to providing DNA samples); see also\nBowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 699–700 (1986) (plaintiff\nobjecting to the government’s independent utilization of his\ndaughter’s social security number, which he himself was not\nrequired to provide or use). The answer is also no where the\npressure being placed upon a person to act contrary to his\nbeliefs or the consequences he faces for not doing so are not\nsubstantial. See Thomas, 450 U.S. at 717 (assessing the\n“coercive impact” of being “put to a choice between fidelity\nto religious belief or cessation of work”). Finally, this Court\nhas “inquir[ed] into the importance of a religious practice” to\nthe individual. Henderson v. Kennedy, 265 F.3d 1072, 1074\n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (denying rehearing en banc). In doing so, we\nhave found no substantial burden exists where a regulation is\n“at most a restriction on one of a multitude of means” for an\nindividual to engage in his desired religious exercise.\nHenderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (the\nplaintiffs could spread the gospel any number of ways, just\nnot the prohibited means of selling t-shirts on the National\nMall); see also Mahoney, 642 F.3d at 1120–21 (the plaintiff\nhad ample alternative means of spreading his religious\nmessage besides chalking the sidewalk in front of the White\nHouse).2\n\n\n2\n  While the propriety of this sort of inquiry in pure free exercise\ncases is arguably called into question by recent Supreme Court\n\f                                   8\n     Here, Plaintiffs’ faith compels them to provide their\nemployees and students with health insurance plans. Oral\nArg. Tr. at 19:5–15. Their religious beliefs forbid them not\nonly from providing or paying for contraception, but also\nfrom facilitating its provision. Pls. Br. at 15. Plaintiffs\ntherefore believe they exercise their religion by providing\nhealth insurance plans that do not facilitate access to\ncontraception. Id. at 11-12, 15, 24–25. In determining\nwhether an act constitutes impermissible facilitation Plaintiffs\nare informed by “the Catholic doctrines of material\ncooperation and scandal.” Id. at 36. The sincerity of\nPlaintiffs’ beliefs has not been questioned. Slip Op. at 26.\n\n     Plaintiffs identify at least two acts that the regulations\ncompel them to perform that they believe would violate their\nreligious obligations: (1) “hiring or maintaining a contractual\nrelationship with any company required, authorized, or\nincentivized to provide contraceptive coverage to\nbeneficiaries enrolled in Plaintiffs’ health plans,” Pet. for\nReh’g En Banc at 3; and (2) “filing the self-certification or\nnotification,” id. at 4. Plaintiffs have therefore shown both\nthat they are being compelled to modify their behavior and\nthat, if undertaken, the modification would be a violation of\ntheir religious beliefs. They are unlike the plaintiffs in\nKaemmerling and Bowen, as they have shown they are\nthemselves being compelled to modify their behavior.\n\n    If Plaintiffs do not act in violation of their beliefs,\nhowever, they face two alternatives. First, they may offer\ncoverage that does not include contraceptives and face\nonerous fines. 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b)(1). Alternatively, they\n\nprecedent, see Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862, it is not relevant to this case.\nThat the practice Plaintiffs defend here is of sufficient importance\nto them to form the basis of a substantial burden under RFRA has\nnot been questioned.\n\f                               9\nmay stop providing health insurance altogether, which would\nalso be a violation of their religious beliefs. Oral Arg. Tr. at\n19:5–15.     Imposing such harsh consequences certainly\nsubstantially pressures Plaintiffs to alter their behavior in a\nway inconsistent with their religious beliefs. See Hobby\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759 (stating if “heavy” financial\npenalties “do not amount to a substantial burden, it is hard to\nsee what would”). Plaintiffs have therefore demonstrated\ntheir free exercise is substantially burdened: they are being\n“put[] to [the] choice” of either “‘engag[ing] in conduct that\nseriously violates [their sincere] religious beliefs’” or facing\n“serious” consequences. Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862 (quoting\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775).\n\n                               B\n\n     The panel’s opinion parts ways with precedent by wading\ninto impermissible lines of inquiry. The panel did not dispute\nthat federal law operates to compel Plaintiffs to maintain a\nrelationship with an issuer or TPA that will provide the\ncontraceptive coverage and to execute the self-certification or\nalternative notice. Their disagreement with Plaintiffs is about\nthe significance of those compelled acts; in other words, the\npanel rejected the “adherents’ claim about the religious\nmeaning of the undisputed operation of [] federal\nregulation[s].” Concurring Op. at 1; see also Eternal Word\nTelevision Network, Inc. v. Sec’y, Dep’t of Health & Human\nServs., 756 F.3d 1339, 1340 (11th Cir. 2014) (Pryor, J.\nspecially concurring) (disposing of the argument that the\nplaintiff’s complaint should “fail[] because [the plaintiff]\nholds an erroneous legal opinion about how the contraception\nmandate works” because the plaintiff “offer[ed] no evidence\nthat its complaint turns on the advice of counsel” but instead\noffered “undisputed declarations . . . about the ancient\nteachings of the Catholic Church”). With a thorough analysis\n\f                               10\nof the regulations, the panel determined they “do not compel”\nPlaintiffs to “provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to\ncontraception, sterilization, abortion, or related counseling in\na manner that violates the teachings of the Catholic Church.”\nSlip Op. at 26 (quoting Pls.’ Br. at 15). The panel explained\nthe regulations allow Plaintiffs to “wash[] their hands of any\ninvolvement in providing insurance coverage for\ncontraceptive services.” Id. Therefore, the panel concluded,\nPlaintiffs have been subjected to only to a de minimis burden\nof completing a form, and their RFRA claim fails. Id. at 31.\n\n     In declaring that—contrary to Catholic Plaintiffs’\ncontentions—it would be consistent with the teaching of the\nCatholic Church for Plaintiffs to comply with the regulations\nthe panel exceeded both the “judicial function and [the]\njudicial competence.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716. What\namounts to “facilitating immoral conduct,” Pet. for Reh’g En\nBanc at 1, “scandal,” id. at 7, and “material” or\n“impermissible cooperation with evil,” id.; Slip Op. at 14, are\ninherently theological questions which objective legal\nanalysis cannot resolve and which “federal courts have no\nbusiness addressing.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778; see\nalso id. (stating “the circumstances under which it is wrong\nfor a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but has\nthe effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an\nimmoral act by another” is “a difficult and important question\nof religion and moral philosophy”). The causal connection\nsufficient to create impermissible “facilitation” in the eyes of\na religious group may be very different from what constitutes\nproximate cause in the common law tradition. See Univ. of\nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 566 (Flaum, J., dissenting) (“[W]e\nare judges, not moral philosophers or theologians; this is not a\nquestion of legal causation but of religious faith.”). Likewise,\nwhere civil authorities may conclude an individual has\n“wash[ed his] hands of any involvement,” Slip Op. at 26,\n\f                              11\nadherents of a faith may examine the same situation and, in\ntheir religious judgment, reach the opposite conclusion.\nPontius Pilate, too, washed his hands, but perhaps he\nperceived the stain of complicity remained. See Matthew\n27:24.\n\n     Under the panel’s analysis, it seems no claim of\nsubstantial burden may prevail where the religious\nsignificance of conduct under scripture as interpreted by a\nfaith tradition differs from the legal significance of that\nconduct under the laws of the United States as interpreted by\nfederal judges.     But RFRA would be an exceedingly\nshallow—perhaps nonexistent—protection of religious\nexercise if adherents were only permitted to give the same\nmeaning to their actions or inactions as does the secular law.\n\n     Plaintiffs, including an Archbishop and two Catholic\ninstitutions of higher learning, say compliance with the\nregulations would facilitate access to contraception in\nviolation of the teachings of the Catholic Church. What law\nor precedent grants this Court authority to conduct an\nindependent inquiry into the correctness of this belief?\nInstead, where one sincerely believes performing certain acts\nwould cause him to cross the line between permissible\nbehavior and sin, the Supreme Court has instructed, “it is not\nfor us to say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.”\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778 (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S.\nat 715).       Plaintiffs’ sincere determination about the\nobligations their religion imposes is between them and their\nGod and need not be “acceptable, logical, consistent, or\ncomprehensible to others in order to merit . . . protection.”\nThomas, 450 U.S. at 714. This is so even when, in the\ngovernment’s opinion, Plaintiffs’ determination is based on a\nmisunderstanding of the nature of their legal obligations, their\nreligious obligations, or both—as the two could certainly\n\f                                  12\noverlap.3 RFRA’s concern is with the sincerity of religious\nbeliefs and not their accuracy. For example in United States\nv. Lee, Mr. Lee claimed he could not pay social security taxes\nwithout violating an obligation under his Amish faith to care\nfor fellow church members. 455 U.S. 252, 257 (1982). The\nSupreme Court refused to consider the government’s\nargument that paying social security taxes did not actually\ninterfere with exercise of this belief, as the Amish would\n\n3\n  Confusion remains as to the legal obligations the regulations\nimpose on third party administrators (“TPAs”). In Wheaton\nCollege v. Burwell, Justice Sotomayor explained a TPA does not\nhave an independent obligation but instead “bears the legal\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a\nvalid self-certification.” 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2814 n.6 (2014)\n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (citing 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815–\n2713A(b)(2) (2013); 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3–16(b) (2013)). Even\nevaluating the new regulations as supplemented in light of the\nSupreme Court’s ruling in Wheaton College, the panel did not\nidentify any scenario under which a TPA is obligated to provide\ncontraceptive coverage until the TPA is designated a “plan\nadministrator” for purposes of ERISA. Slip Op. 41–43. As the\nregulations currently stand, this designation occurs only after a\nreligious nonprofit has either completed the self-certification form\nor the alternative notice and after the TPA agrees to enter into or\nremain in a contractual relationship with the nonprofit organization.\nSee 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2) (2014) (“If a third party\nadministrator receives a copy of the self-certification from an\neligible organization or a notification from the Department of Labor\n[sent after the religious nonprofit provides notice of its objection to\nthe Department] . . . and agrees to enter into or remain in a\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization . . . the third\nparty administrator shall provide or arrange for payments of\ncontraceptive services . . . .”) (emphasis added). If the panel relied\non a mistaken assumption about the regulations imposing an\nindependent obligation on TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage,\nrehearing en banc is all the more warranted.\n\f                              13\nremain free to care for their own community if they paid\nsocial security taxes but did not collect benefits. Id. Instead\nthe Court simply accepted Mr. Lee’s “contention that both\npayment and receipt of social security benefits is forbidden by\nthe Amish faith,” explaining “[c]ourts are not arbiters of\nscriptural interpretation.” Id. (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S. at\n716).\n\n     The panel’s analysis further parts ways with precedent by\nrecasting Plaintiffs’ objection to the facilitation of access as\nan objection to the conduct of third parties. Slip Op. at 34.\nThe panel relied on Bowen and Kaemmerling to find Plaintiffs\nmay not object “to the role of [their] action in the broader\nregulatory scheme.” Slip Op. at 35. There are two problems\nwith this analysis. First, in this case the government is\nrequiring Plaintiffs to perform objectionable acts. In contrast,\nthe Bowen and Kaemmerling plaintiffs’ objections were to the\ngovernment’s actions. See Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699–700;\nKaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678. The claims in Bowen and\nKaemmerling are different in kind from a claim that the\ngovernment is compelling the individual himself to undertake\nactions he believes are sinful.\n\n     Second, the actions to which Plaintiffs object—which\nmay seem innocent if examined devoid of context—must be\nunderstood in light of the broader regulatory scheme. When\nthe Supreme Court has considered claims involving beliefs\nabout facilitation of immoral conduct, it has not employed the\npanel’s approach of requiring the adherent to view their own\nactions in isolation. Instead the Court found a substantial\nburden where the plaintiffs were compelled to take actions\nthey believed to be impermissible based on the actions’ place\nin a chain of events. See, e.g., Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2759 (the plaintiffs objected to providing access to\nabortifacients because others’ use of the drugs may result in\n\f                               14\nthe destruction of a human embryo); Thomas, 450 U.S. at 710\n(plaintiff objected to fabricating turrets because those turrets\nwould then be affixed by others to military tanks and used by\nothers in warfare). This makes good sense, as the concept of\nfacilitation inherently involves a view of one’s conduct in\nrelation to that of others’. Logic and precedent therefore\ncompel us to permit persons to object to performing an act\nthat would be itself innocent but for its illicit consequences.\nPlaintiffs object to maintaining a relationship with an issuer or\nthird-party administrator (“TPA”) that will use Plaintiffs’\nhealth insurance plans as vehicles to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. They object to completing, as the panel describes\nit, an “opt-out mechanism that shifts to third parties the\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage.” Slip Op. at 36.\nSuch claims do not fall outside the purview of RFRA.\n\n                               III\n\n     As Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial burden on\ntheir free exercise, the government may only prevail by\ndemonstrating the regulations further a compelling interest\nand employ the least restrictive means of doing so. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb–1. A compelling interest is an interest “of the\nhighest order.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215. To satisfy strict\nscrutiny, the government must “specifically identify an actual\nproblem in need of solving” and the burden on free exercise\n“must be actually necessary to the solution.” Brown v. Entm’t\nMerchs. Ass’n, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2738 (2011) (internal\ncitations and quotations omitted). The panel found the\ngovernment demonstrated a compelling interest in “seamless\nprovision of contraceptive services.” Slip Op. at 49. The\npanel then rejected any less restrictive means of providing\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing that would\nrequire women to complete additional steps to obtain the\ncoverage, explaining such means “make the coverage no\n\f                               15\nlonger seamless from the beneficiaries’ perspective.” Id. at\n24.\n\n     Even assuming for the sake of argument that the\ngovernment possesses a compelling interest in the provision\nof contraceptive coverage without cost sharing, it has not\nsucceeded in demonstrating a compelling interest in the\n“seamless” provision of coverage. The government has\npointed to no evidence in the record demonstrating its\npurported interest in providing contraceptive coverage\nwithout cost-sharing is harmed when women must undergo\nadditional administrative steps to receive the coverage. The\ngovernment cites only to one page in the Federal Register to\nsupport the proposition that coverage must be provided\nseamlessly.4 Gov’t Supp. Br. at 20 (citing 78 Fed. Reg.\n39,870, 39,888 (Jul. 2, 2013)). This page provides no\nevidence that a procedure under which individuals must take\nadditional steps to receive contraceptive coverage poses a\n“problem in need of solving,” but instead offers only\nconclusory and unsubstantiated statements that surely cannot\nbe sufficient for the government to meet its burden in strict\nscrutiny analysis. That “additional steps” would be so\nburdensome as to hinder women’s access to contraception is\npure speculation. For example, if all that was required was\nthat the employee or student fills out a “simple, one-step\nform,” that would be a “de minimis requirement” to which we\nassume the panel would have no objection. Slip Op. at 26,\n31; see also Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v.\n\n4\n  The government also references pages of a 2011 Institute of\nMedicine Report entitled, “Clinical Preventative Services for\nWomen: Closing the Gaps.” Gov’t Supp. Br. at 20 (citing pages\n103–07).     These pages of the report discuss benefits of\ncontraceptive services and do not reference, much less weigh, the\ncomparative advantage or disadvantage of procedures for accessing\nthose services.\n\f                               16\nSebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 256 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“If these\nsteps only entail filling out a form, it seems that the burden of\nfilling out that form should fall on those who have no\nreligious objection to doing so.”).\n\n     Further, the government cannot meet its burden of\ndemonstrating a compelling interest where it leaves\n“appreciable damage to [the] supposedly vital interest\nunprohibited.” Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City\nof Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 547 (1993) (quoting Fla. Star v.\nB.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 542 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring)); see\nalso Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 780\n(2002) (stating a law’s purpose is undermined when it is “so\nwoefully underinclusive as to render belief in [its] purpose a\nchallenge to the credulous”). As the panel notes, the\nAffordable Care Act permits employers to “ceas[e] to offer\nhealth insurance as an employment benefit, and instead pay[]\nthe shared responsibility assessment and leav[e] the\nemployees to obtain subsidized health care coverage on an\ninsurance exchange.” Slip Op. at 23. While Plaintiffs state\nthey cannot exercise this option without violating their\nreligious obligations, Oral Arg. Tr. at 19:5–15, the panel\nnevertheless reminds them it would be acceptable under the\nlaw. Slip Op. at 23. The untold many whose employers\nprovide no health insurance and instead pay the assessment\nmust face “logistical, informational, and administrative\nburdens,” id. at 63, in arranging for subsidized coverage on a\nhealth insurance exchange. They must “take steps to learn\nabout, and to sign up for,” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, health\ninsurance on their own. The government simply cannot argue\nwith a straight face that women who gain access to\ncontraceptive coverage by identifying and signing up for a\nsubsidized health insurance plan on a government exchange\nreceive that coverage “seamlessly.” Cf. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.\nCt. at 2783. Therefore, in leaving “appreciable damage” to its\n\f                              17\n“supposedly vital interest” in seamless provision of\ncontraceptive coverage, the government’s regulations cannot\nsurvive strict scrutiny. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,\n508 U.S. at 547 (quoting Fla. Star, 491 U.S. at 542 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring)).\n\n     The question of least restrictive means then becomes the\nother side of the same coin. The government could treat\nemployees whose employers do not provide complete\ncoverage for religious reasons the same as it does employees\nwhose employers provide no coverage. This would entail\nproviding for subsidized—or in this case free—contraceptive\ncoverage to be made available on health care exchanges. An\nemployee of a religious objector then would face the same\nadministrative burdens as those who find complete\ncoverage—including contraceptive services coverage—on the\nexchanges. However, just like others who use the exchanges,\nafter overcoming these administrative hurdles, employees of\nreligious objectors would have contraceptive coverage\nwithout cost sharing. Such a mechanism would therefore be\neffective and would minimize the burden on religious\nadherents, demonstrating its viability as a less restrictive\nmeans than the current regulations.\n\n                              IV\n\n     The Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment\nto deprive individuals of constitutional protection against\nneutral laws—meaning almost any law where the government\ndoes not announce its intention “to infringe upon or restrict\npractices because of their religious motivation.” Church of\nthe Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 533. Genuine neutrality,\nhowever, would “allow[] many different and contending\nvoices to be represented in public discourse.” Michael W.\nMcConnell, Why is Religious Liberty the “First Freedom”?,\n\f                                18\n21 CARDOZO L. REV. 1243, 1262 (2000). When the state\nquells disparate voices, declaring a winner on one side of the\nculture wars, neutrality becomes a proxy for majoritarianism\nand secularism. Id.\n\n     Priests for Life is an organization that exists solely for the\npurpose of countering the benign narrative that contraception\nand abortion are beneficial to women. The other Plaintiffs\nexist, at least in part, to engender a counter-cultural narrative\nthat “life begins at the moment of conception . . . and that\ncertain ‘preventative’ services that interfere with conception\nor terminate a pregnancy are immoral.” Pls. Br. at 15. Those\nwho accept employment with these organizations and students\nwho enroll at these schools do so with full awareness of their\nmediating stance. Nevertheless, though the government\nacknowledges that a primary goal of such organizations is to\noppose the government’s mission of increasing access to and\nuse of contraception, it places them outside its grudging\nreligious exemption and offers only one real choice—they can\nrenounce their religious scruples overtly or in practical effect.\nIf the government coopts their contractors and administrative\nstructures to dispense advice, drugs, and services that\ncontravene their religious views, in effect, it has written\ncontraceptive care, including access to abortifacients, into\nPlaintiffs’ employment contracts and student health care\nagreements. Commandeering is not accommodation, and, in\nthis context, “seamlessness” is just shorthand for surrender.\n\n     The French have another saying, mocking the Bourbon\nrestoration: ils n'ont rien appris, ni rien oublié. Learning\nnothing and forgetting nothing. The modern maxim does the\nBourbon monarchs one better: learning nothing and forgetting\neverything.      Alas, preserving the fragile ark of our\nconstitutionalism requires us to remember that the first\n\f                            19\nprinciple of liberty is freedom from gratuitous coercion. We\nrespectfully dissent.\n\f     KAVANAUGH, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial\nof rehearing en banc: In my respectful view, the panel\nopinion misapplies the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\nand contradicts the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014),\nWheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014), and\nLittle Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Sebelius, 134\nS. Ct. 1022 (2014). I would grant rehearing en banc and rule\nfor the plaintiff religious organizations.\n\n     At the outset, it is important to recognize that two of the\nkey Supreme Court precedents here – Hobby Lobby and\nWheaton College – were divided decisions with vigorous\ndissents. Some believe that those two decisions tilted too far\nin the direction of religious freedom. Others, by contrast,\nthink that those decisions did not go far enough in the\ndirection of religious freedom. We are a lower court in a\nhierarchical judicial system headed by “one supreme Court.”\nU.S. Const. art. III, § 1. It is not our job to re-litigate or trim\nor expand Supreme Court decisions. Our job is to follow\nthem as closely and carefully and dispassionately as we can.\nDoing so here, in my respectful view, leads to the conclusion\nthat the plaintiff religious organizations should ultimately\nprevail on their RFRA claim, but not to the full extent that\nthey seek.\n\n     Some background: The Affordable Care Act requires\nmost employers, including non-profit organizations, to\nprovide health insurance coverage for their employees or else\npay a significant monetary penalty to the Government. By\nregulation, that insurance must cover all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives, including certain methods of birth control that,\nsome believe, operate as abortifacients and result in the\ndestruction of embryos.\n\n     As a religious accommodation, the regulations exempt\nreligious non-profit organizations from the contraceptive\n\f                                 2\nmandate. To be exempt from the monetary penalty, however,\nthe religious organizations must either submit a form with\ncertain required information to their insurer or submit a letter\nwith certain required information to the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services. 1 (For ease of reference, I will use the\nterm “form” to cover both documents.) The insurer must\ncontinue to provide contraceptive coverage to the religious\norganizations’ employees, albeit with separate funds provided\neither by the insurer itself or by the United States.\n\n    Many prominent religious organizations around the\ncountry – including the plaintiffs in this case – have bitterly\n\n    1\n       The form submitted to a religious organization’s insurer must\ncertify that the organization (1) opposes providing coverage for\nsome or all of the contraceptive services required by the\ncontraceptive mandate on account of religious objections; (2) is\norganized and operates as a non-profit entity; and (3) holds itself\nout as a religious organization. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(a), (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b), (c)(1). In\ncertain circumstances, the form must also “include notice” of the\ninsurer’s obligations to provide contraceptive coverage to the\nreligious organization’s employees.          29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)(A).\n      The letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services must\ninclude the following information: (1) the name of the religious\nnon-profit organization; (2) the basis on which it qualifies for an\naccommodation; (3) its objection based on sincerely held religious\nbeliefs to providing coverage for some or all contraceptive services,\nincluding notice of the subset of contraceptive services to which it\nobjects; (4) its insurance plan’s name and type; and (5) the name\nand contact information for any of the insurance plan’s third party\nadministrators and health insurance issuers. See 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B),         (c)(1)(ii);   45       C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(c)(1)(ii); Coverage of Certain Preventative Services\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, 79 Fed. Reg. 51,092, 51,094-95\n(Aug. 27, 2014).\n\f                                 3\nobjected to this scheme. They complain that submitting the\nrequired form contravenes their religious beliefs because\ndoing so, in their view, makes them complicit in providing\ncoverage for contraceptives, including some that they believe\noperate as abortifacients. They say that the significant\nmonetary penalty for failure to submit the form constitutes a\nsubstantial burden on their exercise of religion. They\ncontend, moreover, that the Government has less restrictive\nways of ensuring that the employees of the religious\norganizations have access to contraception without making\nthe organizations complicit in the scheme in this way.\n\n     The plaintiffs in this case have sued under the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, known as RFRA. RFRA grants\nindividuals and organizations an exemption from generally\napplicable federal laws that “substantially burden” their\n“exercise of religion,” unless the Government demonstrates\nthat the law furthers a “compelling governmental interest” and\nis the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest. 42\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1. 2 As the Supreme Court has explained,\n“RFRA was designed to provide very broad protection for\nreligious liberty.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2767, slip op.\nat 17. RFRA statutorily incorporated the compelling interest\ntest that the Supreme Court had applied in cases such as\nSherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), and Wisconsin v.\nYoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b)(1).\n\n   Under RFRA and the relevant Supreme Court case law,\nwe must consider three questions here. First, do the\n    2\n       The relevant section of RFRA provides in full: “Government\nmay substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it\ndemonstrates that application of the burden to the person – (1) is in\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\ninterest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b).\n\f                                4\nregulations – which compel religious organizations to submit\nthe required form or else pay significant monetary penalties –\n“substantially burden” the religious organizations’ “exercise\nof religion”? Second, if so, does the Government have a\n“compelling” interest in facilitating access to contraception\nfor the employees of these religious organizations? Third, if\nthe Government does have such a compelling interest, do the\nregulations represent the “least restrictive” means of\nfurthering that interest?\n\n    I conclude as follows:\n\n     First, under Hobby Lobby, the regulations substantially\nburden the religious organizations’ exercise of religion\nbecause the regulations require the organizations to take an\naction contrary to their sincere religious beliefs (submitting\nthe form) or else pay significant monetary penalties.\n\n    Second, that said, Hobby Lobby strongly suggests that the\nGovernment has a compelling interest in facilitating access to\ncontraception for the employees of these religious\norganizations.\n\n     Third, this case therefore comes down to the least\nrestrictive means question. Under Hobby Lobby, Wheaton\nCollege, and Little Sisters of the Poor, requiring the religious\norganizations to submit this form is not the Government’s\nleast restrictive means of furthering its interest in facilitating\naccess to contraception for the organizations’ employees.\nRather, the Government can achieve its interest even if it\naccepts the less restrictive notice that the Supreme Court has\nalready relied on in the Wheaton College and Little Sisters of\nthe Poor cases. Unlike the form required by current federal\nregulations, the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice does not require a religious organization to identify or\n\f                               5\nnotify its insurer, and thus lessens the religious organization’s\ncomplicity in what it considers to be wrongful. And even\nwith just the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice, the Government can independently determine the\nidentity of the organization’s insurer and thereby ensure that\nthe same insurer continues to provide the same contraceptive\ncoverage to the organization’s employees. Hence, the\nWheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice is a less\nrestrictive way for the Government to achieve its compelling\ninterest.\n\n                                I\n\n     First, under Hobby Lobby, this regulatory scheme\nimposes a substantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of\nreligion.\n\n     Under RFRA, a substantial burden on the exercise of\nreligion occurs when, for example, the Government imposes\nsanctions or punishment on someone, or denies a benefit to\nsomeone, for exercising his or her religion. Thus, if the\nGovernment requires someone (under threat of incurring\nmonetary sanctions or punishment, or of having a benefit\ndenied) to act or to refrain from acting in violation of his or\nher sincere religious beliefs, that constitutes a substantial\nburden on the exercise of religion. See Burwell v. Hobby\nLobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2775-79, slip op. at 31-38\n(2014); Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment\nSecurity Division, 450 U.S. 707, 717-18 (1981); Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U.S. 398, 403-04 (1963).\n\n    That is precisely what has happened here.\n\n     The “substantial burden” in this case comes from the\nlarge monetary penalty imposed on religious organizations\n\f                                  6\nthat choose not to submit the required form. Cf. Hobby\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775-76, 2779, slip op. at 31-32, 38. It is\nsettled that a direct monetary penalty on the exercise of\nreligion constitutes a “substantial burden.” See id. (penalty\nfor not providing contraceptive coverage); Wisconsin v.\nYoder, 406 U.S. 205, 208, 218-19 (1972) (fine for not sending\nchildren to high school); Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404 (describing\nhypothetical fine for Saturday worship). 3\n\n    Therefore, the remaining question with respect to the first\nprong of the RFRA analysis is whether submitting the form\nactually contravenes plaintiffs’ sincere religious beliefs. In\nanalyzing that question, we must first understand the context\nin which the question arises. In most religious liberty cases,\nthe Government has said in essence: “Do X or suffer a\npenalty.” The religious objector responds that X violates his\n\n     3\n       The Supreme Court has determined that denying benefits to\n(and not just imposing penalties on) someone engaged in conduct\nmandated by religious belief imposes a substantial burden on the\nexercise of religion. In denial-of-benefits cases, “[w]hile the\ncompulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is\nnonetheless substantial.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718. Congress\nincorporated that broad understanding of substantial burden into\nRFRA. Of course, the question of indirect burdens from the denial\nof government benefits is not at issue in this case. Here, we have\nthe classic direct monetary penalty compelling conduct that\ncontravenes religious belief. There has never been a question that\nsuch a direct penalty imposes a substantial burden on the exercise\nof religion. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775-76, 2779, slip op.\nat 31-32, 38; Yoder, 406 U.S. at 208, 218; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at\n404. Put simply, it is black-letter law that a “substantial burden” on\nthe exercise of religion occurs when, as here, the government\n“compel[s] someone to do something that violates his religious\nbeliefs, or prohibit[s] someone from doing something that is\nmandated by his religious beliefs.” Eugene Volokh, The First\nAmendment and Related Statutes 1060 (5th ed. 2014).\n\f                               7\nor her religious beliefs. For example, in the recent Holt v.\nHobbs case, it was “shave your beard or suffer a penalty.”\nSee Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 860-61, slip op. at 4\n(2015). Or in the classic Wisconsin v. Yoder case, it was\n“send your children to high school or pay a $5 fine.” See 406\nU.S. at 208. Or in United States v. Lee, it was “pay the Social\nSecurity tax or suffer a penalty.” See 455 U.S. 252, 254-55\n(1982). Simple enough.\n\n     Here, the situation is only slightly more complicated.\nThe Government has said in essence: “Do X or Y or suffer a\npenalty.” X is provide contraceptive coverage. Y is submit\nthe form. All agree that X – providing contraceptive coverage\n– implicates plaintiffs’ “exercise of religion.” But religious\norganizations can avoid that option by choosing Y –\nsubmitting the form. In other words, the Government is\nexempting      religious   organizations     from   providing\ncontraceptive coverage but is still saying: “Submit the form\nor suffer a penalty.”\n\n    As a result, the key inquiry under the first prong of\nRFRA is whether submitting the form violates plaintiffs’\nsincere religious beliefs. The form is part of the process by\nwhich the Government ensures that the religious\norganizations’ insurers provide contraceptive coverage to the\norganizations’ employees.        To plaintiffs, the act of\n“submitting” this form would, “in their religious judgment,\nimpermissibly facilitate[] delivery” of contraceptive and\nabortifacient coverage. Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Br. 1.\n\n    As the Supreme Court stated in Hobby Lobby, such a\nquestion of complicity – that is, when “it is wrong for a\nperson to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has\nthe effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an\nimmoral act by another” – is “a difficult and important\n\f                                   8\nquestion of religion and moral philosophy.” Hobby Lobby,\n134 S. Ct. at 2778, slip op. at 36. Judge Gorsuch has\nexplained well the complicity issue that arises in these\ncircumstances: “All of us face the problem of complicity. All\nof us must answer for ourselves whether and to what degree\nwe are willing to be involved in the wrongdoing of others.\nFor some, religion provides an essential source of guidance\nboth about what constitutes wrongful conduct and the degree\nto which those who assist others in committing wrongful\nconduct themselves bear moral culpability. [Plaintiffs] are\namong those who seek guidance from their faith on these\nquestions. Understanding that is the key to understanding this\ncase.” Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114,\n1152 (10th Cir. 2013) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).\n\n     But what if the religious organizations are misguided in\nthinking that this scheme – in which the form is part of the\nprocess by which the Government ensures contraceptive\ncoverage – makes them complicit in facilitating contraception\nor abortion? That is not our call to make under the first prong\nof RFRA. The Supreme Court has emphasized that judges in\nRFRA cases may question only the sincerity of a plaintiff’s\nreligious belief, not the correctness or reasonableness of that\nreligious belief. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774 n.28,\n2777-79, slip op. at 29 n.28, 35-38; see also Thomas, 450 U.S.\nat 714-16. 4 The Supreme Court has long stated, moreover,\n\n\n     4\n       In that regard, it is important to note at least three limits on a\nclaimant’s ability to prevail under RFRA.\n     First, RFRA does not provide protection to philosophical,\npolicy, political, or personal beliefs, for example. It protects only\nreligious beliefs. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a) (“Government shall not\nsubstantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the\nburden results from a rule of general applicability, except as\nprovided in subsection (b) of this section.”) (emphasis added).\n\f                                  9\nthat religious beliefs need not be “acceptable, logical,\nconsistent, or comprehensible to others” in order to merit\nprotection. Thomas, 450 U.S. at 714. As Justice Brennan, the\nprimary architect of the body of religious freedom law now\nincorporated into RFRA, once put it: “[R]eligious freedom –\nthe freedom to believe and to practice strange and, it may be,\nforeign creeds – has classically been one of the highest values\n\n\n\n      Second, RFRA does not cover insincere religious beliefs – that\nis, beliefs that are not truly held – such as when someone asserts a\npersonal objection dressed up as a religious objection. Under\nRFRA, the courts must police sincerity. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained, RFRA reflects Congress’s confidence in “the ability of\nthe federal courts to weed out insincere claims.” Hobby Lobby, 134\nS. Ct. at 2774, slip op. at 29. And the Hobby Lobby Court\napprovingly cited a number of cases where courts have inquired\ninto the sincerity of religious claims. Id. at 2774 nn.28-29, slip op.\nat 29-30 nn.28-29 (citing United States v. Quaintance, 608 F.3d\n717, 718-19 (10th Cir. 2010); Abate v. Walton, 77 F.3d 488, 1996\nWL 5320, at *5 (9th Cir. Jan. 5, 1996); Ochs v. Thalacker, 90 F.3d\n293, 296 (8th Cir. 1996); Green v. White, 525 F. Supp. 81, 83-84\n(E.D. Mo. 1981); Winters v. State, 549 N.W.2d 819, 819-20 (Iowa\n1996)). As the Supreme Court has previously stated: “[W]hile the\ntruth of a belief is not open to question, there remains the\nsignificant question whether it is truly held. This is the threshold\nquestion of sincerity which must be resolved in every case.” United\nStates v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185 (1965) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In short, in these religious freedom cases, the\ncourts appropriately “inquir[e] into the sincerity” of a claimant’s\n“professed religiosity.” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725\nn.13 (2005) (applying the related Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act).\n      Third, as explained more fully below, RFRA’s compelling\ninterest standard allows the Government to compel or proscribe\naction in certain circumstances even though, by doing so, the\nGovernment may be substantially burdening someone’s religion.\n\f                               10\nof our society.” Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 612\n(1961) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n     That bedrock principle means that we may not question\nthe wisdom or reasonableness (as opposed to the sincerity) of\nplaintiffs’ religious beliefs – including about complicity in\nwrongdoing.        In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court\nemphatically confirmed that point. There, as here, the\nGovernment argued that the employers’ alleged complicity in\nproviding contraception did not infringe on the employers’\nreligious beliefs. In particular, the Government claimed that\n“the connection between what the objecting parties must do”\n(pay for insurance) and “the end that they find to be morally\nwrong (destruction of an embryo)” was “simply too\nattenuated” because the end would occur only as a result of\nintervening decisions by individual covered employees.\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2777, slip op. at 35.\n\n     The Supreme Court adamantly rejected the basic premise\nof the Government’s argument. The Court emphasized that\nfederal courts have “no business” trying to answer whether\nthe religious beliefs asserted in a RFRA case – including the\ncomplicity belief at issue in Hobby Lobby – are correct or\nreasonable. Id. at 2778, slip op. at 36. A federal court may\nnot tell the objectors that “their beliefs are flawed,” and thus\nmay not arrogate to itself “the authority to provide a binding\nnational answer to this religious and philosophical question”\nof complicity. Id. at 2778, slip op. at 36-37. Instead, the\n“narrow function” of federal courts is to determine whether\nthe belief is sincere and “reflects an honest conviction.” Id. at\n2779, slip op. at 37-38 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\ndoing so, moreover, courts must keep in mind that RFRA\nprotects “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled\nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-5(7)(A) (defining “religious exercise” for purposes\n\f                               11\nof the related Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act); see id. § 2000bb-2 (incorporating that Act’s\ndefinition set forth in § 2000cc-5 into RFRA).\n\n     As a matter of religious belief, plaintiffs in this case say\nthat the act of submitting the required form makes them\ncomplicit in moral wrongdoing. Importantly, no one here\ndisputes that plaintiffs’ religious belief is sincere and reflects\nan honest conviction. Cf. Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S.\nCt. 2806, 2808, slip op. at 4 (2014) (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (“The sincerity of Wheaton’s deeply held religious\nbeliefs is beyond refute.”); id. at 2812, slip op. at 11.\nTherefore, plaintiffs’ decision to decline to submit the\nrequired letter or form is an “exercise of religion” under\nRFRA. No one disputes, moreover, that plaintiffs will be\nrequired to pay huge monetary penalties if they do not submit\nthe required form. Those large monetary penalties plainly\nrepresent a “substantial burden” on plaintiffs’ exercise of\nreligion. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759, slip op. at 2.\n\n     Judge Flaum persuasively summarized the point in a\nsimilar case that involved Notre Dame: “Yet we are judges,\nnot moral philosophers or theologians; this is not a question of\nlegal causation but of religious faith. Notre Dame tells us that\nCatholic doctrine prohibits the action that the government\nrequires it to take. So long as that belief is sincerely held, I\nbelieve we should defer to Notre Dame’s understanding.”\nUniversity of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547, 566 (7th\nCir. 2014) (Flaum, J., dissenting), vacated and remanded, 135\nS. Ct. 1528 (2015). Judge Pryor has likewise cogently\nexplained: “So long as the [religious organization’s] belief is\nsincerely held and undisputed – as it is here – we have no\nchoice but to decide that compelling the participation of the\n[religious organization] is a substantial burden on its religious\nexercise.”     Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v.\n\f                              12\nSecretary, Department of Health & Human Services, 756 F.3d\n1339, 1348 (11th Cir. 2014) (Pryor, J., specially concurring).\n\n    In short, under Hobby Lobby, the regulations\nsubstantially burden plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n\n     The panel opinion concludes, however, that there is no\nsubstantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. In\nparticular, the panel opinion says that plaintiffs are wrong to\nthink that they would be complicit in moral wrongdoing if\nthey submit this form, as required by the Government. But to\nreiterate: Judicially second-guessing the correctness or\nreasonableness (as opposed to the sincerity) of plaintiffs’\nreligious beliefs is exactly what the Supreme Court in Hobby\nLobby told us not to do. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2778, slip op. at 36. And Hobby Lobby was not the first\nSupreme Court case to say as much. See Thomas, 450 U.S. at\n714-16.\n\n     The panel opinion responds that plaintiffs are simply\nmisunderstanding the law and that the law, properly\nunderstood, does not actually make plaintiffs complicit in\nproviding contraceptive coverage. But there is no dispute that\nthe Government is requiring plaintiffs to submit a form (to the\nGovernment or to the insurer) or else pay a penalty. And\nthere is no dispute that the form is part of the process by\nwhich the Government ensures that the religious\norganizations’ insurers provide contraceptive coverage to the\norganizations’ employees. In other words, the form matters\nand plays a role in this scheme. After all, if the form were\nmeaningless, why would the Government require it? The\nGovernment is requiring plaintiffs to submit the form\nprecisely because the form is part of the process by which the\nGovernment ensures that the religious organizations’ insurers\nprovide contraceptive coverage to the organizations’\n\f                                  13\nemployees. 5    Plaintiffs in turn sincerely believe that\nsubmitting the form under those circumstances makes them\ncomplicit in wrongdoing in contravention of their religious\nbeliefs. See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Br. 1. Compelling\nsubmission of the form therefore imposes a substantial burden\nunder RFRA. 6\n\n     The panel opinion separately notes that the Government\nintended the form to accommodate religious organizations so\nthat the organizations themselves would not have to provide\n\n     5\n        If the form were meaningless, the Government presumably\nwould not require it and perpetuate this rancorous dispute with\nreligious organizations around the country.\n      6\n        The panel’s concurrence in the denial of rehearing en banc\nlargely echoes Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in Wheaton College.\nCompare Panel Concurrence at 5 (“In no respect do we, nor could\nwe, question Plaintiffs’ sincere beliefs about what their faith\npermits and forbids of them. But we can and must decide which\nparty is right about how the law works.”), with Wheaton College,\n134 S. Ct. at 2812, slip op. at 10 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting)\n(“Wheaton is mistaken – not as a matter of religious faith, in which\nit is undoubtedly sincere, but as a matter of law . . . . Any provision\nof contraceptive coverage by Wheaton’s third-party administrator\nwould not result from any action by Wheaton; rather, in every\nmeaningful sense, it would result from the relevant law and\nregulations.”). But the Supreme Court, by a 6-3 margin, did not\nagree with Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in Wheaton College, at least\nfor purposes of the injunction. The Court instead granted an\ninjunction under the All Writs Act to Wheaton College, which the\nCourt could do only if it concluded that the required form\n“indisputably” would impose a substantial burden on Wheaton\nCollege’s exercise of religion. See Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 507 U.S. 1301, 1303\n(1993) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2808, slip op. at 4\n(Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f                              14\ncontraceptive coverage. But the panel opinion has been faked\nout by the Government’s accommodation.                      The\naccommodation provides an alternative, but the alternative\nitself imposes a substantial burden on the religious\norganizations’ exercise of religion. Again, this case arises in\na “Do X or Y or pay a penalty” posture. All agree that X –\nproviding contraceptive coverage – infringes plaintiffs’\nexercise of religion. But so does Y – submitting the form.\nWhat the panel opinion misses is that submitting this form is\nitself an act that contravenes the organizations’ sincere\nreligious beliefs. It is no different from the recent Holt case,\nin which the act that contravened the Muslim prisoner’s\nsincere religious beliefs was shaving his beard. Submitting\nthe form = shaving your beard. Or the Yoder case, in which\nthe act that contravened the Amish parents’ beliefs was\nsending their children to high school. Submitting the form =\nsending your children to high school. Or the Lee case, in\nwhich the act that contravened the Amish employer’s\nreligious beliefs was paying Social Security taxes.\nSubmitting the form = paying the Social Security tax. Or the\nSherbert case, in which the act that contravened the Seventh-\nday Adventist’s belief was working on Saturday, the Sabbath\nday of the faith. Submitting the form = working on the\nSabbath.\n\n     In all of those cases, the Supreme Court recognized that\nthe act in question represented a sincere religious belief that\nthe Government could not override except by employing the\nleast restrictive means to further a compelling governmental\ninterest. The same is true here. The panel opinion does not\nfully come to grips with that critical point, in my view.\n\n     The panel opinion therefore also does not appreciate that\nthe substantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion comes\nfrom the monetary penalty (which in this case happens to be\n\f                              15\nhuge) that the organizations will have to pay if they adhere to\ntheir religious beliefs and do not submit the required form. In\nHolt, the substantial burden came from the discipline the\nprisoner would receive if he refused to shave his beard. In\nYoder, it was the $5 monetary fine for the parents whose\nchildren did not attend high school. In Lee, it was the\nmonetary penalty for failure to pay taxes. In Sherbert, it was\nthe denial of unemployment benefits for not working on the\nSabbath.\n\n    The essential principle is crystal clear: When the\nGovernment forces someone to take an action contrary to his\nor her sincere religious belief (here, submitting the form) or\nelse suffer a financial penalty (which here is huge), the\nGovernment has substantially burdened the individual’s\nexercise of religion. So it is in this case.\n\n     To be clear, that conclusion does not mean that plaintiffs\nprevail on their RFRA claim. Rather, it means only that they\nprevail on the first prong of the three-part RFRA inquiry and\nthat we now must move on to the second and third prongs.\nThe Government may still be able to compel plaintiffs to\nsubmit the required form if the Government prevails on those\nsecond and third prongs. Cf. Lee, 455 U.S. at 257, 261\n(Government may force Amish employer to pay Social\nSecurity taxes notwithstanding substantial burden on Amish\nemployer’s religion).\n\n                               II\n\n     Second, does the Government have a compelling interest\nin facilitating women’s access to contraception – in particular,\nin facilitating access to contraception for the employees of\nthese religious organizations? See 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(b)\n(“Government may substantially burden a person’s exercise\n\f                                 16\nof religion only if it demonstrates that application of the\nburden to the person . . . is in furtherance of a compelling\ngovernmental interest.”) (emphasis added); Gonzales v. O\nCentro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418,\n430-31 (2006) (compelling interest test focuses on interest as\napplied to particular plaintiffs).\n\n     The plaintiff religious organizations strenuously argue\nthat there is no such compelling governmental interest. As I\nsee it, however, plaintiffs’ argument cannot be squared with\nthe views expressed by a majority of the Justices in Hobby\nLobby.\n\n     To begin with, how do we determine whether the\nGovernment has a “compelling interest” in overriding a\nfundamental constitutional or statutory right such as RFRA’s\nright to religious freedom? Good question. No code or\nhistory book lists the Government’s compelling interests.\nRather, courts have developed those interests over time, in\ncommon-law-like fashion. 7 What we do know, to put it in\ncolloquial and somewhat question-begging terms, is that the\nasserted governmental interest must be so critically important\nthat it justifies overriding certain fundamental individual\nrights in certain circumstances. To quote the Supreme Court,\n\n    7\n       The compelling interest nomenclature took root somewhat\nignominiously in free speech cases as a way to justify the\nGovernment’s suppression of Communist speech. See, e.g.,\nKonigsberg v. State Bar of California, 366 U.S. 36, 49-52 (1961);\nBarenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 126-27 (1959); Sweezy v.\nNew Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 265-67 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring in result). In any event, the compelling interest override\nis now an established part of various constitutional doctrines,\nincluding the First and Fourteenth Amendments. And Congress\nexpressly incorporated it into the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct.\n\f                                17\nthe interest must be “of the highest order.” Wisconsin v.\nYoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215 (1972); see Burwell v. Hobby Lobby\nStores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2781, slip op. at 41 (2014).\nExamples of compelling interests from past Supreme Court\ncases include conducting the military draft, maintaining the\ntax system, running the Social Security program, and\npreventing discrimination against third parties. See Gillette v.\nUnited States, 401 U.S. 437, 461-63 (1971); Hernandez v.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, 490 U.S. 680, 699-700\n(1989); United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257-59 (1982);\nBob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 603-04\n(1983). 8\n\n     In this case, we do not have to tackle the compelling\ninterest question without guidance from above. Justice\nKennedy strongly suggested in his Hobby Lobby concurring\nopinion – which appears to be controlling de facto if not also\nde jure on this particular issue – that the Government\ngenerally has a compelling interest in facilitating access to\ncontraception for women employees. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.\nCt. at 2785-86, slip op. at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see\nalso id. at 2779-80, slip op. at 39-40 (majority opinion); id. at\n2799-2801, slip op. at 23-27 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); cf.\nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977). In\nparticular, Justice Kennedy referred to the “premise” of the\nCourt’s decision: namely, its “assumption” that the\n\n    8\n       As noted above, at least three aspects of RFRA limit the\nstatute’s reach and thus help answer the parade of horribles\nsometimes raised in opposition to religious freedom claims. First,\nRFRA covers only religious objections.           Second, insincere\nreligious claims are excluded from RFRA’s protection. Third,\nRFRA’s compelling interest standard allows the Government to\ncompel or proscribe action in certain circumstances even though, by\ndoing so, the Government may be substantially burdening\nsomeone’s religion.\n\f                                18\nGovernment has a “legitimate and compelling interest” in\nfacilitating access to contraception. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct.\nat 2786, slip op. at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice\nKennedy’s use of the term “compelling” in this context was\nno doubt carefully considered. And the four dissenting\nJustices likewise stated that the Government had a compelling\ninterest in facilitating women’s access to contraception. Id. at\n2799-2801, slip op. at 23-27 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n\n     It is not difficult to comprehend why a majority of the\nJustices in Hobby Lobby (Justice Kennedy plus the four\ndissenters) would suggest that the Government has a\ncompelling interest in facilitating women’s access to\ncontraception. About 50% of all pregnancies in the United\nStates are unintended. The large number of unintended\npregnancies causes significant social and economic costs. To\nalleviate those costs, the Federal Government has long sought\nto reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, including\nthrough the Affordable Care Act by making contraceptives\nmore cheaply and widely available. It is commonly accepted\nthat reducing the number of unintended pregnancies would\nfurther women’s health, advance women’s personal and\nprofessional opportunities, reduce the number of abortions,9\nand help break a cycle of poverty that persists when women\nwho cannot afford or obtain contraception become pregnant\nunintentionally at a young age. In light of the numerous\nbenefits that would follow from reducing the number of\nunintended pregnancies, it comes as no surprise that Justice\nKennedy’s opinion expressly referred to a “compelling”\ngovernmental interest in facilitating women’s access to\ncontraception.\n\n\n    9\n     As the panel opinion in this case accurately pointed out, as of\nnow about 40% of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n\f                                19\n    In short, even if the Court did not formally hold as much,\nHobby Lobby at least strongly suggests that the Government\nhas a compelling interest in facilitating access to\ncontraception for the employees of these religious\norganizations. 10\n\n                                III\n\n     Third, in light of those two conclusions, we must\nconsider the least restrictive means issue. When, as here, a\nlaw substantially burdens the exercise of religion, but the law\nfurthers a compelling governmental interest, RFRA requires\nthe Government to use the “least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(b). The Supreme Court has emphasized that the\n“least-restrictive-means      standard    is     exceptionally\ndemanding.” Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct.\n2751, 2780, slip op. at 40 (2014).\n\n     Congress adopted the least restrictive means requirement\nto help thread the needle between two conflicting principles.\nThe least restrictive means requirement, properly applied,\nallows religious beliefs to be accommodated and the\nGovernment’s compelling interests to be achieved – a win-\nwin resolution of these often contentious disputes. See\nGonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,\n546 U.S. 418, 436 (2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(a)(5))\n(RFRA “‘is a workable test for striking sensible balances\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental\ninterests.’”). As a leading First Amendment scholar has put\n    10\n        Justice Kennedy’s Hobby Lobby opinion did not expressly\ndiscuss whether a compelling governmental interest in ensuring\ngeneral coverage for contraceptives encompasses ensuring coverage\nfor those specific drugs and services that, some believe, operate as\nabortifacients and result in the destruction of embryos.\n\f                               20\nit: “If there’s some way of granting an exemption and yet\naccomplishing the government’s goal, then there’s no real\nneed to interfere with the religious practice, so the exemption\nmust be granted.” Eugene Volokh, The First Amendment and\nRelated Statutes 986 (5th ed. 2014).\n\n     Requiring religious organizations to submit the form\nmandated by current federal regulations is not the\nGovernment’s least restrictive means of furthering its interest\nin facilitating access to contraception for the organizations’\nemployees. That is because the Government can still achieve\nits interest by allowing the religious organizations to submit\nthe less restrictive notice that the Supreme Court has already\ntwice indicated should be good enough to satisfy the\nGovernment’s interest.\n\n     In the Wheaton College and Little Sisters of the Poor\ncases, the Supreme Court carefully specified that the religious\norganizations would satisfy their current legal obligations by\nsubmitting a simple notice to the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services “in writing that it is a nonprofit organization\nthat holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.” Wheaton\nCollege v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2807, slip op. at 1\n(2014); see also Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged\nv. Sebelius, 134 S. Ct. 1022, 1022, slip op. at 1 (2014) (notice\nshould be “in writing that they are non-profit organizations\nthat hold themselves out as religious and have religious\nobjections to providing coverage for contraceptive services”);\ncf. Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Secretary,\nDepartment of Health & Human Services, 756 F.3d 1339,\n1349 (11th Cir. 2014) (Pryor, J., specially concurring) (“The\nUnited States, for example, could require the [religious\norganization] to provide a written notification of its religious\nobjection to the Department of Health and Human Services.”).\n\f                              21\n\n     By contrast to the form required by current federal\nregulations, the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice does not require the religious organizations to identify\nor notify their insurers, and thus (according to plaintiffs)\nlessens the religious organizations’ degree of complicity in\nwhat they consider to be wrongful as a matter of religious\nbelief. See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Br. 10. And even with\nthe less detailed Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice, the Government can independently determine the\nidentity of the organizations’ insurers and thereby ensure that\nthe insurers provide contraceptive coverage to the\norganizations’ employees.        The Wheaton College/Little\nSisters of the Poor notice may create some administrative\ninconvenience for the Government, because the Government\nitself will have to identify the religious organizations’\ninsurers. But administrative inconvenience alone does not\nnegate the feasibility of an otherwise less restrictive means –\nunless the administrative problem would be “of such\nmagnitude” that it would render “the entire statutory scheme\nunworkable.” Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 408-09\n(1963); see also Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 731 (1986)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(“[A]dministrative inconvenience is not alone sufficient to\njustify a burden on free exercise unless it creates problems of\nsubstantial magnitude.”).\n\n     If a religious organization does not use the currently\nrequired form but instead uses the Wheaton College/Little\nSisters of the Poor notice, how would that affect third parties,\nnamely the religious organizations’ employees?            That\nquestion matters because the Supreme Court has stated that\n“courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.” Cutter v.\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720 (2005) (applying the related\n\f                               22\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act). In\nHobby Lobby, the Court reiterated that this consideration\n“will often inform the analysis of the Government’s\ncompelling interest and the availability of a less restrictive\nmeans of advancing that interest.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct.\nat 2781 n.37, slip op. at 42 n.37. As Justice Kennedy put it in\nhis concurrence, the accommodation must not “unduly restrict\nother persons, such as employees, in protecting their own\ninterests.” Id. at 2787, slip op. at 4 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n      But here, the religious organizations’ employees would\nstill receive the same insurance coverage from the same\ninsurer for contraceptives. As the Supreme Court explained\nin its Wheaton College order: “Nothing in this interim order\naffects the ability of the applicant’s employees and students to\nobtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved\ncontraceptives” or “precludes the Government from relying\non this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to\nfacilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage under\nthe Act.” Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2807, slip op. at 1-2.\nSo accommodating the religious organizations by allowing\nthem to use the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice would not, to use Justice Kennedy’s formulation,\n“unduly restrict” third parties. Cf. Douglas NeJaime & Reva\nB. Siegel, Conscience Wars: Complicity-Based Conscience\nClaims in Religion and Politics, 124 Yale L.J., at 116\n(forthcoming 2015) (version of Apr. 10, 2015) (“Wheaton\nCollege, like Hobby Lobby, appears to tie accommodation to\nthe fact that the government has other ways of providing for\nthe statute’s intended beneficiaries so that no third-party harm\nwould result from the accommodation.”).\n\n     Although the Supreme Court’s Wheaton College and\nLittle Sisters of the Poor orders were not final merits rulings,\nthey at least qualify as extremely strong signals from the\n\f                              23\nSupreme Court about how to resolve the least restrictive\nmeans issue in this case. In particular, the Court in Wheaton\nCollege granted an injunction under the All Writs Act, which\nis appropriate “only where the legal rights at issue are\nindisputably clear.” Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2808, slip\nop. at 4 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Moreover, the Court issued the Wheaton College\norder just days after its Hobby Lobby decision, and it did so\nover a detailed and forceful dissent.\n\n     In any event, regardless of whether we as a lower court\nare formally bound by the Supreme Court stay orders in\nWheaton College and Little Sisters of the Poor, the notice\nidentified by the Supreme Court in those two cases is\nundoubtedly a less restrictive way for the Government to\nfurther its interest than the form required by current federal\nregulations. It necessarily follows that the form required by\ncurrent regulations is not the “least restrictive means”\navailable to the Government. As the Supreme Court said a\nfew months ago in a similar context: If “a less restrictive\nmeans is available for the Government to achieve its goals,\nthe Government must use it.” Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853,\n864, slip op. at 11 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSo too here.\n\n     To be sure, some religious organizations claim that even\nthe less restrictive Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice still imposes a substantial burden on their religious\nbeliefs. But that obviously does not help the Government’s\nargument in support of the current, even more burdensome\nform. The key point here is that the Wheaton College/Little\nSisters of the Poor notice is less restrictive (that is, less\nburdensome) than the currently required form and yet still\nfurthers the Government’s compelling interest. Under RFRA,\n\f                                  24\nthe Government therefore must employ that less restrictive\nmeans. 11\n\n     Put simply, the Government need not – and therefore\nunder RFRA may not – pursue its compelling interest in\nfacilitating access to contraception by requiring religious non-\nprofit organizations to submit the form required by current\nfederal regulations. 12\n\n\n\n     11\n         The Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice\nrequires a religious organization to, in effect, raise its hand to opt\nout. But contrary to what the panel’s concurrence in the denial of\nrehearing en banc says, see Panel Concurrence at 3-4 n.1, the\ncurrently required form requires a religious organization both to\nraise its hand and to point to its insurer. From the perspective of\nthe plaintiff religious organizations, the currently required form is\ntherefore more burdensome because it makes the organizations\nidentify or notify their insurers, which the organizations believe\nmakes them more complicit in the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage to which they object as a matter of religious belief.\n      12\n         As the Court in Hobby Lobby noted, the Government could\ndirectly subsidize or provide contraceptives to employees of\nreligious non-profit organizations. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2780-81, slip op. at 41. The direct funding option raises certain\nfeasibility issues. A means that is not a reasonably feasible way of\nfurthering the Government’s interest cannot be deemed a less\nrestrictive means of furthering that interest. In Little Sisters of the\nPoor, Hobby Lobby, and Wheaton College, the Court did not say\nthat direct funding was the least restrictive means of furthering the\nGovernment’s interest.       If it had, then even the Wheaton\nCollege/Little Sisters of the Poor notice would itself be too\nrestrictive. In any event, what matters in the present case is that the\nWheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice is less restrictive\nthan the form required by the current federal regulations but still\nachieves the Government’s interest.\n\f                               25\n     One final note for clarity: The Government may of\ncourse continue to require the religious organizations’\ninsurers to provide contraceptive coverage to the religious\norganizations’ employees, even if the religious organizations\nobject. As Judge Flaum correctly explained, “RFRA does not\nauthorize religious organizations to dictate the independent\nactions of third-parties, even if the organization sincerely\ndisagrees with them.” University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius,\n743 F.3d 547, 567 (7th Cir. 2014) (Flaum, J., dissenting),\nvacated and remanded, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015). “That is true\nwhether the third-party is the government, an insurer, a\nstudent, or some other actor.” Id. “So long as the\ngovernment does not require” religious organizations\nthemselves “to take action, RFRA does not give” the religious\norganizations “a right to prevent the government from\nproviding contraceptives to” the religious organizations’\nemployees. Id.\n\n                             ***\n\n     In sum, I respectfully would grant rehearing en banc and\nrule for the plaintiff religious organizations on the ground that\nthe Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice is a less\nrestrictive way than the currently mandated form for the\nGovernment to achieve its compelling interest in facilitating\naccess to contraception for the organizations’ employees.\n\f",

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014).\n\n     The dissenters and we agree that the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act provides robust protection for religious\nliberty—without regard to whether others might view an\nadherent’s beliefs or practices as irrational, trivial, or wrong.\nNothing in our opinion should be seen to detract from that\nvital guarantee. Where we part ways is that the dissenters\nperceive in Hobby Lobby a potentially sweeping, new RFRA\nprerogative for religious adherents to make substantial-burden\nclaims based on sincere but erroneous assertions about how\nfederal law works. They believe we ignored that prerogative\nhere. The dissenters read more into the Supreme Court’s\ndecision than it supports. Hobby Lobby embraced adherents’\nclaim about the religious meaning of the undisputed operation\nof a federal regulation; this case involves a claim that courts\nmust credit religious adherents’ incorrect assertions about\nhow a different federal regulation operates. Because Hobby\nLobby did not address that distinct issue, we see no conflict.\n\n     The Court in Hobby Lobby invalidated the requirement\nthat closely-held, for-profit businesses with religious\nobjections to contraception nonetheless must buy health-\ninsurance coverage for their employees that pays for\ncontraception, or else face taxes or penalties. 134 S. Ct. at\n2759. No opt out was available to those businesses. The\nparties in Hobby Lobby did not dispute what the law required,\nnor its practical effects: All agreed that the Affordable Care\n\f                               2\nAct regulations mandated that employer-sponsored health\nplans include contraception, and that as a result plaintiffs’\nemployees got access to contraception paid for, in part, by\ntheir employers. See id. at 2762. What the parties in Hobby\nLobby contested were the moral and religious implications of\nthe businesses’ conceded role. The plaintiff business owners\nbelieved that “providing the coverage demanded . . . is\nconnected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is\nsufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the\ncoverage.”     Id. at 2778.      The government disagreed,\ncontending that employees’ intervening choices whether to\nuse contraception broke the chain of moral culpability, and\nhence the law did not substantially burden the businesses’\nreligious exercise. Id. at 2777-78.\n\n     In rejecting the government’s position in Hobby Lobby,\nthe Supreme Court emphasized that courts may not second-\nguess religious beliefs about the wrongfulness of facilitating\nanother person’s immoral act. Id. at 2778. RFRA forbids\ncourts from “provid[ing] a binding national answer to . . .\nreligious and philosophical question[s]” or “tell[ing] the\nplaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.” Id.; see also id. at\n2779 (“[I]t is not for us to say that [plaintiffs’] religious\nbeliefs are mistaken or insubstantial. Instead, our ‘narrow\nfunction in this context is to determine’ whether the line\ndrawn reflects ‘an honest conviction.’” (alteration marks\nomitted) (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110440\"><a href=\"/opinion/110440/thomas-v-review-bd-of-indiana-employment-security-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716\n(1981))). The context makes clear that the Court’s discussion\nof facilitation simply restates the basic tenet of the religious\nfreedom cases that judges may not question the correctness of\na plaintiff’s religious beliefs.\n\n     That reasoning is inapplicable here. The dispute between\nthe government and the Plaintiffs in this case, unlike in Hobby\nLobby, is not about religious implications of acknowledged—\n\f                                 3\nbut perhaps attenuated—support for contraceptive use; the\nparties disagree here about how the law functions, and\ntherefore whether there is any causal connection at all\nbetween employers’ opt-out notice and employees’ access to\ncontraception. Plaintiffs challenge the accommodation, not\navailable in Hobby Lobby, based on their assertion that what\ncauses their employees to receive contraceptive coverage is\ntheir compliance with the accommodation’s precondition that\nthey give notice of their sincere religious objections to such\ncoverage. As Plaintiffs characterize it, their act of excusing\nthemselves from legal liability for not providing contraceptive\ncoverage is what made such coverage available to employees,\nand hence violated their Catholic faith.\n\n     We held that Plaintiffs miscast the accommodation. The\nregulation allows Plaintiffs to continue to do just what they\ndid before the ACA: notify their insurers of their sincere\nreligious objection to contraception, and arrange for\ncontraception to be excluded from the health insurance\ncoverage they provide.1 As before, insurers may sell plans\n\n1\n   Judge Kavanaugh is perplexed as to why, if not for an\nimpermissible reason, the government requires any form at all.\nKavanaugh Dissent at 12-13 & n.5. The form is far from\n“meaningless,” id., because it acts as “the written equivalent of\nraising a hand in response to the government’s query as to which\nreligious organizations want to opt out,” and extricates those\nobjectors in a manner consistent with the contraceptive coverage\nrequirement. Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human\nServs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Only once an insurer\nbecomes aware of the employer’s religious objection can it take the\nsteps needed to effectuate the opt out, such as: exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the employer’s group health plan,\nprevent the employer’s payment from funding contraception, notify\nthe beneficiaries that the employer plays no role in administering or\n\f                                 4\nthat exclude contraception to their religious-nonprofit\ncustomers. The difference is that now the ACA and its\nregulations require that contraceptive coverage be provided to\nall insured women. In the case of women who get their\ninsurance coverage through an accommodated employer, the\nlaw requires insurers to offer the women contraception under\na separate plan—completely segregated from the objecting\nemployer’s plan and its payments.\n\n     The judges who urge us to rehear the case say that Hobby\nLobby leaves no room for us to question Plaintiffs’\ncharacterization of how the challenged regulations operate,\nincluding their assertions that the regulations force Plaintiffs\nto facilitate the provision of contraception. As they read it,\nHobby Lobby forbids a court deciding a claim under RFRA to\nassess whether a plaintiff’s belief about what a law requires\nhim to do is correct. See, e.g., Kavanaugh Dissent at 8-11;\nBrown Dissent at 10-12. Both dissents argue that Hobby\nLobby’s discussion of facilitation requires us simply to accept\n\n\nfunding contraceptive coverage, and arrange for separate mailings\nand accounting.       Id. (citing regulatory provisions).      Judge\nKavanaugh would hold that including the insurer’s identity in the\nform is unnecessarily restrictive of religious exercise because,\nextending our metaphor, he says it requires the objecting employer\n“both to raise its hand and to point to its insurer.” Kavanaugh\nDissent at 24 n.11. But it is more apt to say that, if the employer\nopts to raise its hand where the insurer cannot see it (i.e. via the\nalternative notice delivered to the government rather than the\ninsurer, see 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)), the government must be in a position promptly to\ncommunicate the religious objection to the insurer, or else the\nemployer’s insurance plan will continue to include contraceptive\ncoverage. An insurer that is kept in the dark about an employer’s\nreligious objections cannot do what it must to honor the opt out.\n\f                              5\nwhatever beliefs a RFRA plaintiff avows—even erroneous\nbeliefs about what a challenged regulation actually requires.\n\n     Neither the holding nor the reasoning of Hobby Lobby\nmade that leap. RFRA understandably accorded Hobby\nLobby Stores a victory in a contest over what religious\nmeaning to ascribe to the Stores’ payment for contraceptive\ncoverage. That holding does not require us to credit Priests\nfor Life’s legally inaccurate assertions about the operation of\nthe regulation they challenge. See Univ. of Notre Dame v.\nBurwell, No. 13-3853, slip op. at 11, 15 (7th Cir. May 19,\n2015); see also id. at 34 (Hamilton, J., concurring). But see\nid. at 44-46 (Flaum, J., dissenting). Our panel opinion\nexplains that it is the mandate on insurers that causes\nPlaintiffs’ employees to receive contraceptive coverage, and\nnot anything Plaintiffs are required to do in claiming their\naccommodation. The panel thus held that Plaintiffs suffered\nno substantial burden triggering RFRA strict scrutiny.\n\n     The dispute we resolved is legal, not religious. Under the\nACA regulations, a woman who obtains health insurance\ncoverage through her employer is no more entitled to\ncontraceptive coverage if her employer submits the disputed\nnotice than if it does not. The ACA obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to all insured women does not depend\non that notice. Nothing in RFRA requires that we accept\nPlaintiffs’ assertions to the contrary.\n\n     RFRA protects religious exercise. In no respect do we,\nnor could we, question Plaintiffs’ sincere beliefs about what\ntheir faith permits and forbids of them. But we can and must\ndecide which party is right about how the law works. We\nconcluded that the regulation challenged in this case does not,\nas a matter of law or fact, give Plaintiffs’ conduct the\ncontraception-facilitating effect of which they complain.\n\f                               6\nIndeed, it bears emphasis that the whole point of the\nchallenged regulation is to scrupulously shield objecting\nreligious nonprofits from any role in making contraception\navailable to women. The accommodation is itself evidence of\nthe fundamental commitment of this Nation to religious\nfreedom that RFRA embodies. The regulation is, of course,\nproperly subject to judicial scrutiny to verify that it comports\nwith governing law, including Hobby Lobby. Because we\nconclude that it does, we believe that en banc review is not\nwarranted in this case.\n\f    BROWN, Circuit Judge, with whom HENDERSON, Circuit\nJudge, joins, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\nThe French say: plus ça change et plus c'est la même chose.\nThe more things change; the more they remain the same.\nThere was once a time when the church was the state and the\nchurch as the state embodied all hope of human well-being.\nR.W. SOUTHERN, WESTERN SOCIETY AND THE CHURCH IN THE\nMIDDLE AGES 23 (1970). To challenge the church was to\nundermine civilization. Thus, the imposition of orthodoxy\nwas deemed necessary, and dissent, which amounted to\nheresy, was met with coercion and violence. See ST. THOMAS\nAQUINAS, SUMMA THEOLOGIÆ pt. II-II, q. 11, art. 3.\n\n     This history prompted John Locke to urge toleration and\nstress the necessity of distinguishing “the business of civil\ngovernment from that of religion” and establishing clear\nboundaries between them. John Locke, A Letter Concerning\nToleration, reprinted in 5 THE WORKS OF JOHN LOCKE 5, 9\n(12th ed. 1824). The Framers went further, establishing not\nonly a limited government, but recognizing the primacy of\nindividual conscience and seeking the line between freedom\nand justice. Thus, the Bill of Rights “grew in soil which also\nproduced a philosophy that . . . liberty was attainable through\nmere absence of governmental restraints, and that government\nshould be entrusted with few controls and only the mildest\nsupervision over men’s affairs.” W.

The federal\ngovernment was given no authority over men’s souls. For the\nFounders, the not-so-distant history of persecution\nengendered a fierce commitment to each individual’s natural\nand inalienable right to believe according to his “conviction\nand conscience” and to exercise his religion “as these may\ndictate.” James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance\nAgainst Religious Assessments, reprinted in 2 WRITINGS OF\nJAMES MADISON 183, 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). “If there is any\nfixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no\nofficial, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in\n\f                               2\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or\nforce citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”\nBarnette, 319 U.S. at 642.\n\n     Of course, the right to freely exercise one’s religion is\nnot—and was not intended to be—absolute. The Founders\nrecognized state coercion would at times be necessary, with\nMadison himself stating “full and free exercise . . . according\nto the dictates of conscience” could be limited where “the\npreservation of equal liberty . . . and the existence of the\n[government] may be manifestly endangered.” G. Hunt,\nMadison and Religious Liberty, 1 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE\nAMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION, H.R. Doc. No. 702,\n57th Cong., 1st Sess., 163, 166–67 (1901).

We live in a time where\nprogress is sought “through expanded and strengthened\ngovernmental controls.” Barnette, 319 U.S. at 640. In a\nsense the government now fills the role formerly occupied by\nthe church, embodying the hope of human well-being. For\nthe government to pursue the good and to solve society’s\nproblems, it must first identify that which is good and that\nwhich is problematic through subjective and value-laden\njudgments.      Cf. Laurence H. Tribe, Disentangling\nSymmetries: Speech, Association, Parenthood, 28 PEPP. L.\nREV. 641, 651–53 (2001) (stating that when the government\ntakes a side in a “direct clash of competing images of ‘the\ngood life,’” it “is making an intrinsically contestable\nstatement about the rightness or wrongness” of ideals).\nConsequently, orthodoxy has been rehabilitated, and dissent\n\f                               3\nfrom the government’s determinations may be quelled\nthrough coercion—onerous fines or banishment from\ncommerce and the public square.\n\n     Despite the parallels, we do not find ourselves full circle\nquite yet. Religious adherents may still seek refuge from\nunnecessary governmental coercion through the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”). When the federal\ngovernment substantially burdens free exercise, it may do so\nonly in pursuit of a compelling interest and even then must\nuse the least restrictive means. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.\nFurther, the conscience of the individual remains protected in\nthat he must “answer to no man for the verity of his religious\nviews.” United States v.

The panel conceded Plaintiffs\nsincerely “believe that the regulatory framework makes them\ncomplicit in the provision of contraception,” Slip Op. at 27\n(quoting Mich. Catholic Conf. v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385\n(6th Cir. 2014), vacated and remanded, No. 14-701, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1879768</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 27, 2015)). That acknowledgement\nshould end our inquiry into the substance of their beliefs.\nViewed objectively, Plaintiffs’ belief that the acts the\nregulations compel them to perform would facilitate access to\ncontraception in a manner that violates the teachings of their\nChurch may “seem incredible, if not preposterous,” to some\npeople. Ballard, 322 U.S. at 87. However, this Court is\nneither qualified nor authorized to so scrutinize any religious\nbelief. The panel trespassed into an area of inquiry Supreme\nCourt precedent forecloses. It then proceeded to accept\nevidence that is insufficient under the rulings of the Supreme\nCourt to find the purported compelling interest. For these\nreasons we believe this exceptionally important case is worthy\nof en banc review.\n\f                              4\n                               I\n\n     We begin by addressing the panel’s opening observations\nand by making some of our own with the hopes of\ndistinguishing between fact and fancy. First, this case is not\nabout denying any woman access to contraception. A\nwoman’s right to obtain and use contraception was recognized\nlong ago, and nothing about this case calls for the issue to be\nrevisited. See Griswold v. Connecticut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107082\"><a href=\"/opinion/107082/griswold-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965).\n\n     Second, this case is about the religious freedom of these\nreligiously-affiliated organizations and not about the free\nexercise concerns of the plaintiffs in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby\nStores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2681317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2681317/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In that case, the\nSupreme Court found the Department of Health and Human\nServices’ (“HHS”) approach to religious nonprofits\ndemonstrated there were less restrictive means available to\ndeal with conscientious objectors among for-profit\ncorporations. Id. at 2781–82. The Court expressly reserved\njudgment on whether HHS’s approach “complies with RFRA\nfor purposes of all religious claims.” Id. at 2782. While the\ngovernment’s approach to religious non-profits may—or may\nnot—fully put to rest the Hobby Lobby plaintiffs’ religious\nobjections, that is irrelevant to our consideration of the\nreligious objections put forth by Plaintiffs in this case. The\npresent Plaintiffs are entitled to their own personal beliefs.\n\n     Third, this case is not “paradoxical” because Plaintiffs\nobject to regulatory requirements the government intended as\na religious accommodation. Slip Op. at 24 (quoting Univ. of\nNotre Dame v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">743</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557 (7th Cir. 2014),\nvacated and remanded, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015)). That the\ngovernment’s expressed intent in enacting the regulations at\nissue was to allay religious adherents’ concerns about the\ncontraception mandate is not determinative of the ultimate\n\f                                5\nquestion of whether Plaintiffs were in fact accommodated.\nWhere the government imposes a substantial burden on\nreligious exercise and labels it an “accommodation,” that\nburden is surely as distressing to adherents as it would be if\nimposed without such a designation. Therefore, heightened\nskepticism is not appropriate. We should look at Plaintiffs’\nclaims as we would any RFRA claim. After all, in the\nsubstantial burden analysis, the government’s motivations—\nno matter how benevolent—are irrelevant; we ask only\nwhether the government’s action operates to place\n“substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior\nand to violate his beliefs.” Thomas v. Review Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110440\"><a href=\"/opinion/110440/thomas-v-review-bd-of-indiana-employment-security-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718 (1981).\n\n     Fourth, this case is not one in which Plaintiffs’ “only\nharm . . . is that they sincerely feel aggrieved by their inability\nto prevent what other people would do to fulfill regulatory\nobjectives after they opt out.” Slip Op. at 24. The regulations\ncompel Plaintiffs to take actions they believe would amount\nto “impermissibly facilitating access to abortion-inducing\nproducts, contraceptives, and sterilization” in violation of\ntheir religious tenets. Pet. for Reh’g En Banc at 1. Make no\nmistake: the harm Plaintiffs complain of—and the harm this\nCourt therefore is called to assess—is from their inability to\nconform their own actions and inactions to their religious\nbeliefs without facing massive penalties from the government.\n\n                                II\n\n    The panel’s substantial burden analysis is inconsistent\nwith the precedent of the Supreme Court and this Court,\nwhich identifies both permissible and impermissible lines of\ninquiry in the substantial burden analysis of a RFRA claim.\n\f                               6\n                               A\n\n     As we have recognized, whether a burden is “substantial”\nfor purposes of RFRA is a question of law for the court to\nanswer, not a “question[] of fact, proven by the credibility of\nthe claimant.” Mahoney v.

While RFRA forecloses asking whether the\nexercise is “compelled by, or central to, a system of religious\nbelief,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-5(7)(A), the court does ask\nwhether the plaintiff’s beliefs are sincere. The answer is no if\nhis claims are not “sincerely based on a religious belief” but\ninstead on “some other motivation.” Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862;\nsee also Hobby Lobby, 134 S.

Oral\nArg. Tr. at 19:5–15. Their religious beliefs forbid them not\nonly from providing or paying for contraception, but also\nfrom facilitating its provision. Pls. Br. at 15. Plaintiffs\ntherefore believe they exercise their religion by providing\nhealth insurance plans that do not facilitate access to\ncontraception. Id. at 11-12, 15, 24–25. In determining\nwhether an act constitutes impermissible facilitation Plaintiffs\nare informed by “the Catholic doctrines of material\ncooperation and scandal.” Id. at 36. The sincerity of\nPlaintiffs’ beliefs has not been questioned. Slip Op. at 26.\n\n     Plaintiffs identify at least two acts that the regulations\ncompel them to perform that they believe would violate their\nreligious obligations: (1) “hiring or maintaining a contractual\nrelationship with any company required, authorized, or\nincentivized to provide contraceptive coverage to\nbeneficiaries enrolled in Plaintiffs’ health plans,” Pet. for\nReh’g En Banc at 3; and (2) “filing the self-certification or\nnotification,” id. at 4. Plaintiffs have therefore shown both\nthat they are being compelled to modify their behavior and\nthat, if undertaken, the modification would be a violation of\ntheir religious beliefs. They are unlike the plaintiffs in\nKaemmerling and Bowen, as they have shown they are\nthemselves being compelled to modify their behavior.\n\n    If Plaintiffs do not act in violation of their beliefs,\nhowever, they face two alternatives. First, they may offer\ncoverage that does not include contraceptives and face\nonerous fines. 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b)(1). Alternatively, they\n\nprecedent, see Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862, it is not relevant to this case.\nThat the practice Plaintiffs defend here is of sufficient importance\nto them to form the basis of a substantial burden under RFRA has\nnot been questioned.\n\f                               9\nmay stop providing health insurance altogether, which would\nalso be a violation of their religious beliefs. Oral Arg. Tr. at\n19:5–15.     Imposing such harsh consequences certainly\nsubstantially pressures Plaintiffs to alter their behavior in a\nway inconsistent with their religious beliefs. See Hobby\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759 (stating if “heavy” financial\npenalties “do not amount to a substantial burden, it is hard to\nsee what would”). Plaintiffs have therefore demonstrated\ntheir free exercise is substantially burdened: they are being\n“put[] to [the] choice” of either “‘engag[ing] in conduct that\nseriously violates [their sincere] religious beliefs’” or facing\n“serious” consequences. Holt, 135 S. Ct. at 862 (quoting\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775).\n\n                               B\n\n     The panel’s opinion parts ways with precedent by wading\ninto impermissible lines of inquiry. The panel did not dispute\nthat federal law operates to compel Plaintiffs to maintain a\nrelationship with an issuer or TPA that will provide the\ncontraceptive coverage and to execute the self-certification or\nalternative notice.

With a thorough analysis\n\f                               10\nof the regulations, the panel determined they “do not compel”\nPlaintiffs to “provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to\ncontraception, sterilization, abortion, or related counseling in\na manner that violates the teachings of the Catholic Church.”\nSlip Op. at 26 (quoting Pls.’ Br. at 15). The panel explained\nthe regulations allow Plaintiffs to “wash[] their hands of any\ninvolvement in providing insurance coverage for\ncontraceptive services.” Id. Therefore, the panel concluded,\nPlaintiffs have been subjected to only to a de minimis burden\nof completing a form, and their RFRA claim fails. Id. at 31.\n\n     In declaring that—contrary to Catholic Plaintiffs’\ncontentions—it would be consistent with the teaching of the\nCatholic Church for Plaintiffs to comply with the regulations\nthe panel exceeded both the “judicial function and [the]\njudicial competence.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716. What\namounts to “facilitating immoral conduct,” Pet. for Reh’g En\nBanc at 1, “scandal,” id. at 7, and “material” or\n“impermissible cooperation with evil,” id.; Slip Op. at 14, are\ninherently theological questions which objective legal\nanalysis cannot resolve and which “federal courts have no\nbusiness addressing.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778; see\nalso id. (stating “the circumstances under which it is wrong\nfor a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but has\nthe effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an\nimmoral act by another” is “a difficult and important question\nof religion and moral philosophy”). The causal connection\nsufficient to create impermissible “facilitation” in the eyes of\na religious group may be very different from what constitutes\nproximate cause in the common law tradition. See Univ. of\nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 566 (Flaum, J., dissenting) (“[W]e\nare judges, not moral philosophers or theologians; this is not a\nquestion of legal causation but of religious faith.”). Likewise,\nwhere civil authorities may conclude an individual has\n“wash[ed his] hands of any involvement,” Slip Op. at 26,\n\f                              11\nadherents of a faith may examine the same situation and, in\ntheir religious judgment, reach the opposite conclusion.\nPontius Pilate, too, washed his hands, but perhaps he\nperceived the stain of complicity remained. See Matthew\n27:24.\n\n     Under the panel’s analysis, it seems no claim of\nsubstantial burden may prevail where the religious\nsignificance of conduct under scripture as interpreted by a\nfaith tradition differs from the legal significance of that\nconduct under the laws of the United States as interpreted by\nfederal judges.     But RFRA would be an exceedingly\nshallow—perhaps nonexistent—protection of religious\nexercise if adherents were only permitted to give the same\nmeaning to their actions or inactions as does the secular law.\n\n     Plaintiffs, including an Archbishop and two Catholic\ninstitutions of higher learning, say compliance with the\nregulations would facilitate access to contraception in\nviolation of the teachings of the Catholic Church. What law\nor precedent grants this Court authority to conduct an\nindependent inquiry into the correctness of this belief?\nInstead, where one sincerely believes performing certain acts\nwould cause him to cross the line between permissible\nbehavior and sin, the Supreme Court has instructed, “it is not\nfor us to say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.”\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2778 (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S.\nat 715).

In Wheaton\nCollege v. Burwell, Justice Sotomayor explained a TPA does not\nhave an independent obligation but instead “bears the legal\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a\nvalid self-certification.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Even\nevaluating the new regulations as supplemented in light of the\nSupreme Court’s ruling in Wheaton College, the panel did not\nidentify any scenario under which a TPA is obligated to provide\ncontraceptive coverage until the TPA is designated a “plan\nadministrator” for purposes of ERISA. Slip Op. 41–43. As the\nregulations currently stand, this designation occurs only after a\nreligious nonprofit has either completed the self-certification form\nor the alternative notice and after the TPA agrees to enter into or\nremain in a contractual relationship with the nonprofit organization.\nSee 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713AT(b)(2) (2014) (“If a third party\nadministrator receives a copy of the self-certification from an\neligible organization or a notification from the Department of Labor\n[sent after the religious nonprofit provides notice of its objection to\nthe Department] . . . and agrees to enter into or remain in a\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization . . . the third\nparty administrator shall provide or arrange for payments of\ncontraceptive services . . . .”) (emphasis added). If the panel relied\non a mistaken assumption about the regulations imposing an\nindependent obligation on TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage,\nrehearing en banc is all the more warranted.\n\f                              13\nremain free to care for their own community if they paid\nsocial security taxes but did not collect benefits. Id. Instead\nthe Court simply accepted Mr. Lee’s “contention that both\npayment and receipt of social security benefits is forbidden by\nthe Amish faith,” explaining “[c]ourts are not arbiters of\nscriptural interpretation.” Id. (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S. at\n716).\n\n     The panel’s analysis further parts ways with precedent by\nrecasting Plaintiffs’ objection to the facilitation of access as\nan objection to the conduct of third parties. Slip Op. at 34.\nThe panel relied on Bowen and Kaemmerling to find Plaintiffs\nmay not object “to the role of [their] action in the broader\nregulatory scheme.” Slip Op. at 35. There are two problems\nwith this analysis. First, in this case the government is\nrequiring Plaintiffs to perform objectionable acts. In contrast,\nthe Bowen and Kaemmerling plaintiffs’ objections were to the\ngovernment’s actions. See Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699–700;\nKaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678. The claims in Bowen and\nKaemmerling are different in kind from a claim that the\ngovernment is compelling the individual himself to undertake\nactions he believes are sinful.\n\n     Second, the actions to which Plaintiffs object—which\nmay seem innocent if examined devoid of context—must be\nunderstood in light of the broader regulatory scheme. When\nthe Supreme Court has considered claims involving beliefs\nabout facilitation of immoral conduct, it has not employed the\npanel’s approach of requiring the adherent to view their own\nactions in isolation. Instead the Court found a substantial\nburden where the plaintiffs were compelled to take actions\nthey believed to be impermissible based on the actions’ place\nin a chain of events. See, e.g., Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2759 (the plaintiffs objected to providing access to\nabortifacients because others’ use of the drugs may result in\n\f                               14\nthe destruction of a human embryo); Thomas, 450 U.S. at 710\n(plaintiff objected to fabricating turrets because those turrets\nwould then be affixed by others to military tanks and used by\nothers in warfare). This makes good sense, as the concept of\nfacilitation inherently involves a view of one’s conduct in\nrelation to that of others’. Logic and precedent therefore\ncompel us to permit persons to object to performing an act\nthat would be itself innocent but for its illicit consequences.\nPlaintiffs object to maintaining a relationship with an issuer or\nthird-party administrator (“TPA”) that will use Plaintiffs’\nhealth insurance plans as vehicles to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. They object to completing, as the panel describes\nit, an “opt-out mechanism that shifts to third parties the\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage.” Slip Op. at 36.\nSuch claims do not fall outside the purview of RFRA.\n\n                               III\n\n     As Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial burden on\ntheir free exercise, the government may only prevail by\ndemonstrating the regulations further a compelling interest\nand employ the least restrictive means of doing so. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb–1. A compelling interest is an interest “of the\nhighest order.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215.

The panel found the\ngovernment demonstrated a compelling interest in “seamless\nprovision of contraceptive services.” Slip Op. at 49. The\npanel then rejected any less restrictive means of providing\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing that would\nrequire women to complete additional steps to obtain the\ncoverage, explaining such means “make the coverage no\n\f                               15\nlonger seamless from the beneficiaries’ perspective.” Id. at\n24.\n\n     Even assuming for the sake of argument that the\ngovernment possesses a compelling interest in the provision\nof contraceptive coverage without cost sharing, it has not\nsucceeded in demonstrating a compelling interest in the\n“seamless” provision of coverage. The government has\npointed to no evidence in the record demonstrating its\npurported interest in providing contraceptive coverage\nwithout cost-sharing is harmed when women must undergo\nadditional administrative steps to receive the coverage. The\ngovernment cites only to one page in the Federal Register to\nsupport the proposition that coverage must be provided\nseamlessly.4 Gov’t Supp. Br. at 20 (citing 78 Fed. Reg.\n39,870, 39,888 (Jul. 2, 2013)). This page provides no\nevidence that a procedure under which individuals must take\nadditional steps to receive contraceptive coverage poses a\n“problem in need of solving,” but instead offers only\nconclusory and unsubstantiated statements that surely cannot\nbe sufficient for the government to meet its burden in strict\nscrutiny analysis. That “additional steps” would be so\nburdensome as to hinder women’s access to contraception is\npure speculation. For example, if all that was required was\nthat the employee or student fills out a “simple, one-step\nform,” that would be a “de minimis requirement” to which we\nassume the panel would have no objection. Slip Op. at 26,\n31; see also Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York v.\n\n4\n  The government also references pages of a 2011 Institute of\nMedicine Report entitled, “Clinical Preventative Services for\nWomen: Closing the Gaps.” Gov’t Supp. Br. at 20 (citing pages\n103–07).     These pages of the report discuss benefits of\ncontraceptive services and do not reference, much less weigh, the\ncomparative advantage or disadvantage of procedures for accessing\nthose services.\n\f                               16\nSebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As the panel notes, the\nAffordable Care Act permits employers to “ceas[e] to offer\nhealth insurance as an employment benefit, and instead pay[]\nthe shared responsibility assessment and leav[e] the\nemployees to obtain subsidized health care coverage on an\ninsurance exchange.” Slip Op. at 23. While Plaintiffs state\nthey cannot exercise this option without violating their\nreligious obligations, Oral Arg. Tr. at 19:5–15, the panel\nnevertheless reminds them it would be acceptable under the\nlaw. Slip Op. at 23. The untold many whose employers\nprovide no health insurance and instead pay the assessment\nmust face “logistical, informational, and administrative\nburdens,” id. at 63, in arranging for subsidized coverage on a\nhealth insurance exchange. They must “take steps to learn\nabout, and to sign up for,” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888, health\ninsurance on their own. The government simply cannot argue\nwith a straight face that women who gain access to\ncontraceptive coverage by identifying and signing up for a\nsubsidized health insurance plan on a government exchange\nreceive that coverage “seamlessly.” Cf. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.\nCt. at 2783. Therefore, in leaving “appreciable damage” to its\n\f                              17\n“supposedly vital interest” in seamless provision of\ncontraceptive coverage, the government’s regulations cannot\nsurvive strict scrutiny. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,\n508 U.S. at 547 (quoting Fla. Star, 491 U.S. at 542 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring)).\n\n     The question of least restrictive means then becomes the\nother side of the same coin. The government could treat\nemployees whose employers do not provide complete\ncoverage for religious reasons the same as it does employees\nwhose employers provide no coverage. This would entail\nproviding for subsidized—or in this case free—contraceptive\ncoverage to be made available on health care exchanges. An\nemployee of a religious objector then would face the same\nadministrative burdens as those who find complete\ncoverage—including contraceptive services coverage—on the\nexchanges. However, just like others who use the exchanges,\nafter overcoming these administrative hurdles, employees of\nreligious objectors would have contraceptive coverage\nwithout cost sharing. Such a mechanism would therefore be\neffective and would minimize the burden on religious\nadherents, demonstrating its viability as a less restrictive\nmeans than the current regulations.\n\n                              IV\n\n     The Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment\nto deprive individuals of constitutional protection against\nneutral laws—meaning almost any law where the government\ndoes not announce its intention “to infringe upon or restrict\npractices because of their religious motivation.” Church of\nthe Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 533.

Br. at 15. Those\nwho accept employment with these organizations and students\nwho enroll at these schools do so with full awareness of their\nmediating stance. Nevertheless, though the government\nacknowledges that a primary goal of such organizations is to\noppose the government’s mission of increasing access to and\nuse of contraception, it places them outside its grudging\nreligious exemption and offers only one real choice—they can\nrenounce their religious scruples overtly or in practical effect.\nIf the government coopts their contractors and administrative\nstructures to dispense advice, drugs, and services that\ncontravene their religious views, in effect, it has written\ncontraceptive care, including access to abortifacients, into\nPlaintiffs’ employment contracts and student health care\nagreements.

I would grant rehearing en banc and rule\nfor the plaintiff religious organizations.\n\n     At the outset, it is important to recognize that two of the\nkey Supreme Court precedents here – Hobby Lobby and\nWheaton College – were divided decisions with vigorous\ndissents. Some believe that those two decisions tilted too far\nin the direction of religious freedom. Others, by contrast,\nthink that those decisions did not go far enough in the\ndirection of religious freedom. We are a lower court in a\nhierarchical judicial system headed by “one supreme Court.”\nU.S. Const. art. III, § 1. It is not our job to re-litigate or trim\nor expand Supreme Court decisions. Our job is to follow\nthem as closely and carefully and dispassionately as we can.\nDoing so here, in my respectful view, leads to the conclusion\nthat the plaintiff religious organizations should ultimately\nprevail on their RFRA claim, but not to the full extent that\nthey seek.\n\n     Some background: The Affordable Care Act requires\nmost employers, including non-profit organizations, to\nprovide health insurance coverage for their employees or else\npay a significant monetary penalty to the Government. By\nregulation, that insurance must cover all FDA-approved\ncontraceptives, including certain methods of birth control that,\nsome believe, operate as abortifacients and result in the\ndestruction of embryos.\n\n     As a religious accommodation, the regulations exempt\nreligious non-profit organizations from the contraceptive\n\f                                 2\nmandate. To be exempt from the monetary penalty, however,\nthe religious organizations must either submit a form with\ncertain required information to their insurer or submit a letter\nwith certain required information to the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services. 1 (For ease of reference, I will use the\nterm “form” to cover both documents.) The insurer must\ncontinue to provide contraceptive coverage to the religious\norganizations’ employees, albeit with separate funds provided\neither by the insurer itself or by the United States.\n\n    Many prominent religious organizations around the\ncountry – including the plaintiffs in this case – have bitterly\n\n    1\n       The form submitted to a religious organization’s insurer must\ncertify that the organization (1) opposes providing coverage for\nsome or all of the contraceptive services required by the\ncontraceptive mandate on account of religious objections; (2) is\norganized and operates as a non-profit entity; and (3) holds itself\nout as a religious organization. See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(a), (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b), (c)(1). In\ncertain circumstances, the form must also “include notice” of the\ninsurer’s obligations to provide contraceptive coverage to the\nreligious organization’s employees.          29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)(A).\n      The letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services must\ninclude the following information: (1) the name of the religious\nnon-profit organization; (2) the basis on which it qualifies for an\naccommodation; (3) its objection based on sincerely held religious\nbeliefs to providing coverage for some or all contraceptive services,\nincluding notice of the subset of contraceptive services to which it\nobjects; (4) its insurance plan’s name and type; and (5) the name\nand contact information for any of the insurance plan’s third party\nadministrators and health insurance issuers. See 29 C.F.R.\n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B),         (c)(1)(ii);   45       C.F.R.\n§ 147.131(c)(1)(ii); Coverage of Certain Preventative Services\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, 79 Fed. Reg. 51,092, 51,094-95\n(Aug. 27, 2014).\n\f                                 3\nobjected to this scheme. They complain that submitting the\nrequired form contravenes their religious beliefs because\ndoing so, in their view, makes them complicit in providing\ncoverage for contraceptives, including some that they believe\noperate as abortifacients. They say that the significant\nmonetary penalty for failure to submit the form constitutes a\nsubstantial burden on their exercise of religion. They\ncontend, moreover, that the Government has less restrictive\nways of ensuring that the employees of the religious\norganizations have access to contraception without making\nthe organizations complicit in the scheme in this way.\n\n     The plaintiffs in this case have sued under the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act, known as RFRA. RFRA grants\nindividuals and organizations an exemption from generally\napplicable federal laws that “substantially burden” their\n“exercise of religion,” unless the Government demonstrates\nthat the law furthers a “compelling governmental interest” and\nis the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest. 42\nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1. 2 As the Supreme Court has explained,\n“RFRA was designed to provide very broad protection for\nreligious liberty.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S.

Second, if so, does the Government have a\n“compelling” interest in facilitating access to contraception\nfor the employees of these religious organizations? Third, if\nthe Government does have such a compelling interest, do the\nregulations represent the “least restrictive” means of\nfurthering that interest?\n\n    I conclude as follows:\n\n     First, under Hobby Lobby, the regulations substantially\nburden the religious organizations’ exercise of religion\nbecause the regulations require the organizations to take an\naction contrary to their sincere religious beliefs (submitting\nthe form) or else pay significant monetary penalties.\n\n    Second, that said, Hobby Lobby strongly suggests that the\nGovernment has a compelling interest in facilitating access to\ncontraception for the employees of these religious\norganizations.\n\n     Third, this case therefore comes down to the least\nrestrictive means question. Under Hobby Lobby, Wheaton\nCollege, and Little Sisters of the Poor, requiring the religious\norganizations to submit this form is not the Government’s\nleast restrictive means of furthering its interest in facilitating\naccess to contraception for the organizations’ employees.\nRather, the Government can achieve its interest even if it\naccepts the less restrictive notice that the Supreme Court has\nalready relied on in the Wheaton College and Little Sisters of\nthe Poor cases. Unlike the form required by current federal\nregulations, the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice does not require a religious organization to identify or\n\f                               5\nnotify its insurer, and thus lessens the religious organization’s\ncomplicity in what it considers to be wrongful. And even\nwith just the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice, the Government can independently determine the\nidentity of the organization’s insurer and thereby ensure that\nthe same insurer continues to provide the same contraceptive\ncoverage to the organization’s employees. Hence, the\nWheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice is a less\nrestrictive way for the Government to achieve its compelling\ninterest.\n\n                                I\n\n     First, under Hobby Lobby, this regulatory scheme\nimposes a substantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of\nreligion.\n\n     Under RFRA, a substantial burden on the exercise of\nreligion occurs when, for example, the Government imposes\nsanctions or punishment on someone, or denies a benefit to\nsomeone, for exercising his or her religion. Thus, if the\nGovernment requires someone (under threat of incurring\nmonetary sanctions or punishment, or of having a benefit\ndenied) to act or to refrain from acting in violation of his or\nher sincere religious beliefs, that constitutes a substantial\nburden on the exercise of religion.

In\nanalyzing that question, we must first understand the context\nin which the question arises. In most religious liberty cases,\nthe Government has said in essence: “Do X or suffer a\npenalty.” The religious objector responds that X violates his\n\n     3\n       The Supreme Court has determined that denying benefits to\n(and not just imposing penalties on) someone engaged in conduct\nmandated by religious belief imposes a substantial burden on the\nexercise of religion. In denial-of-benefits cases, “[w]hile the\ncompulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is\nnonetheless substantial.” Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718. Congress\nincorporated that broad understanding of substantial burden into\nRFRA. Of course, the question of indirect burdens from the denial\nof government benefits is not at issue in this case. Here, we have\nthe classic direct monetary penalty compelling conduct that\ncontravenes religious belief. There has never been a question that\nsuch a direct penalty imposes a substantial burden on the exercise\nof religion. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2775-76, 2779, slip op.\nat 31-32, 38; Yoder, 406 U.S. at 208, 218; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at\n404. Put simply, it is black-letter law that a “substantial burden” on\nthe exercise of religion occurs when, as here, the government\n“compel[s] someone to do something that violates his religious\nbeliefs, or prohibit[s] someone from doing something that is\nmandated by his religious beliefs.” Eugene Volokh, The First\nAmendment and Related Statutes 1060 (5th ed. 2014).\n\f                               7\nor her religious beliefs. For example, in the recent Holt v.\nHobbs case, it was “shave your beard or suffer a penalty.”\nSee Holt v. Hobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771249/holt-v-hobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Yoder case, it was\n“send your children to high school or pay a $5 fine.” See 406\nU.S. at 208. Or in United States v. Lee, it was “pay the Social\nSecurity tax or suffer a penalty.” See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110647\"><a href=\"/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254-55\n(1982). Simple enough.\n\n     Here, the situation is only slightly more complicated.\nThe Government has said in essence: “Do X or Y or suffer a\npenalty.” X is provide contraceptive coverage. Y is submit\nthe form. All agree that X – providing contraceptive coverage\n– implicates plaintiffs’ “exercise of religion.” But religious\norganizations can avoid that option by choosing Y –\nsubmitting the form. In other words, the Government is\nexempting      religious   organizations     from   providing\ncontraceptive coverage but is still saying: “Submit the form\nor suffer a penalty.”\n\n    As a result, the key inquiry under the first prong of\nRFRA is whether submitting the form violates plaintiffs’\nsincere religious beliefs. The form is part of the process by\nwhich the Government ensures that the religious\norganizations’ insurers provide contraceptive coverage to the\norganizations’ employees.        To plaintiffs, the act of\n“submitting” this form would, “in their religious judgment,\nimpermissibly facilitate[] delivery” of contraceptive and\nabortifacient coverage. Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Br. 1.\n\n    As the Supreme Court stated in Hobby Lobby, such a\nquestion of complicity – that is, when “it is wrong for a\nperson to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has\nthe effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an\nimmoral act by another” – is “a difficult and important\n\f                                   8\nquestion of religion and moral philosophy.” Hobby Lobby,\n134 S. Ct. at 2778, slip op. at 36. Judge Gorsuch has\nexplained well the complicity issue that arises in these\ncircumstances: “All of us face the problem of complicity. All\nof us must answer for ourselves whether and to what degree\nwe are willing to be involved in the wrongdoing of others.\nFor some, religion provides an essential source of guidance\nboth about what constitutes wrongful conduct and the degree\nto which those who assist others in committing wrongful\nconduct themselves bear moral culpability. [Plaintiffs] are\namong those who seek guidance from their faith on these\nquestions. Understanding that is the key to understanding this\ncase.” Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1152 (10th Cir. 2013) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).\n\n     But what if the religious organizations are misguided in\nthinking that this scheme – in which the form is part of the\nprocess by which the Government ensures contraceptive\ncoverage – makes them complicit in facilitating contraception\nor abortion? That is not our call to make under the first prong\nof RFRA. The Supreme Court has emphasized that judges in\nRFRA cases may question only the sincerity of a plaintiff’s\nreligious belief, not the correctness or reasonableness of that\nreligious belief. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774 n.28,\n2777-79, slip op. at 29 n.28, 35-38; see also Thomas, 450 U.S.\nat 714-16. 4 The Supreme Court has long stated, moreover,\n\n\n     4\n       In that regard, it is important to note at least three limits on a\nclaimant’s ability to prevail under RFRA.\n     First, RFRA does not provide protection to philosophical,\npolicy, political, or personal beliefs, for example. It protects only\nreligious beliefs. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a) (“Government shall not\nsubstantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the\nburden results from a rule of general applicability, except as\nprovided in subsection (b) of this section.”) (emphasis added).\n\f                                  9\nthat religious beliefs need not be “acceptable, logical,\nconsistent, or comprehensible to others” in order to merit\nprotection. Thomas, 450 U.S. at 714. As Justice Brennan, the\nprimary architect of the body of religious freedom law now\nincorporated into RFRA, once put it: “[R]eligious freedom –\nthe freedom to believe and to practice strange and, it may be,\nforeign creeds – has classically been one of the highest values\n\n\n\n      Second, RFRA does not cover insincere religious beliefs – that\nis, beliefs that are not truly held – such as when someone asserts a\npersonal objection dressed up as a religious objection. Under\nRFRA, the courts must police sincerity. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained, RFRA reflects Congress’s confidence in “the ability of\nthe federal courts to weed out insincere claims.” Hobby Lobby, 134\nS. Ct. at 2774, slip op. at 29. And the Hobby Lobby Court\napprovingly cited a number of cases where courts have inquired\ninto the sincerity of religious claims.

In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court\nemphatically confirmed that point. There, as here, the\nGovernment argued that the employers’ alleged complicity in\nproviding contraception did not infringe on the employers’\nreligious beliefs. In particular, the Government claimed that\n“the connection between what the objecting parties must do”\n(pay for insurance) and “the end that they find to be morally\nwrong (destruction of an embryo)” was “simply too\nattenuated” because the end would occur only as a result of\nintervening decisions by individual covered employees.\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2777, slip op. at 35.\n\n     The Supreme Court adamantly rejected the basic premise\nof the Government’s argument. The Court emphasized that\nfederal courts have “no business” trying to answer whether\nthe religious beliefs asserted in a RFRA case – including the\ncomplicity belief at issue in Hobby Lobby – are correct or\nreasonable. Id. at 2778, slip op. at 36. A federal court may\nnot tell the objectors that “their beliefs are flawed,” and thus\nmay not arrogate to itself “the authority to provide a binding\nnational answer to this religious and philosophical question”\nof complicity. Id. at 2778, slip op. at 36-37. Instead, the\n“narrow function” of federal courts is to determine whether\nthe belief is sincere and “reflects an honest conviction.” Id. at\n2779, slip op. at 37-38 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\ndoing so, moreover, courts must keep in mind that RFRA\nprotects “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled\nby, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-5(7)(A) (defining “religious exercise” for purposes\n\f                               11\nof the related Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act); see id. § 2000bb-2 (incorporating that Act’s\ndefinition set forth in § 2000cc-5 into RFRA).\n\n     As a matter of religious belief, plaintiffs in this case say\nthat the act of submitting the required form makes them\ncomplicit in moral wrongdoing. Importantly, no one here\ndisputes that plaintiffs’ religious belief is sincere and reflects\nan honest conviction. Cf. Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S.\nCt. 2806, 2808, slip op. at 4 (2014) (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (“The sincerity of Wheaton’s deeply held religious\nbeliefs is beyond refute.”); id. at 2812, slip op. at 11.\nTherefore, plaintiffs’ decision to decline to submit the\nrequired letter or form is an “exercise of religion” under\nRFRA. No one disputes, moreover, that plaintiffs will be\nrequired to pay huge monetary penalties if they do not submit\nthe required form. Those large monetary penalties plainly\nrepresent a “substantial burden” on plaintiffs’ exercise of\nreligion. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2759, slip op. at 2.\n\n     Judge Flaum persuasively summarized the point in a\nsimilar case that involved Notre Dame: “Yet we are judges,\nnot moral philosophers or theologians; this is not a question of\nlegal causation but of religious faith. Notre Dame tells us that\nCatholic doctrine prohibits the action that the government\nrequires it to take. So long as that belief is sincerely held, I\nbelieve we should defer to Notre Dame’s understanding.”\nUniversity of Notre Dame v.

Judge Pryor has likewise cogently\nexplained: “So long as the [religious organization’s] belief is\nsincerely held and undisputed – as it is here – we have no\nchoice but to decide that compelling the participation of the\n[religious organization] is a substantial burden on its religious\nexercise.”     Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v.\n\f                              12\nSecretary, Department of Health & Human Services, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1339</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1348 (11th Cir. 2014) (Pryor, J., specially concurring).\n\n    In short, under Hobby Lobby, the regulations\nsubstantially burden plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n\n     The panel opinion concludes, however, that there is no\nsubstantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. In\nparticular, the panel opinion says that plaintiffs are wrong to\nthink that they would be complicit in moral wrongdoing if\nthey submit this form, as required by the Government. But to\nreiterate: Judicially second-guessing the correctness or\nreasonableness (as opposed to the sincerity) of plaintiffs’\nreligious beliefs is exactly what the Supreme Court in Hobby\nLobby told us not to do. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2778, slip op. at 36. And Hobby Lobby was not the first\nSupreme Court case to say as much. See Thomas, 450 U.S. at\n714-16.\n\n     The panel opinion responds that plaintiffs are simply\nmisunderstanding the law and that the law, properly\nunderstood, does not actually make plaintiffs complicit in\nproviding contraceptive coverage. But there is no dispute that\nthe Government is requiring plaintiffs to submit a form (to the\nGovernment or to the insurer) or else pay a penalty. And\nthere is no dispute that the form is part of the process by\nwhich the Government ensures that the religious\norganizations’ insurers provide contraceptive coverage to the\norganizations’ employees. In other words, the form matters\nand plays a role in this scheme. After all, if the form were\nmeaningless, why would the Government require it? The\nGovernment is requiring plaintiffs to submit the form\nprecisely because the form is part of the process by which the\nGovernment ensures that the religious organizations’ insurers\nprovide contraceptive coverage to the organizations’\n\f                                  13\nemployees. 5    Plaintiffs in turn sincerely believe that\nsubmitting the form under those circumstances makes them\ncomplicit in wrongdoing in contravention of their religious\nbeliefs. See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Br. 1. Compelling\nsubmission of the form therefore imposes a substantial burden\nunder RFRA. 6\n\n     The panel opinion separately notes that the Government\nintended the form to accommodate religious organizations so\nthat the organizations themselves would not have to provide\n\n     5\n        If the form were meaningless, the Government presumably\nwould not require it and perpetuate this rancorous dispute with\nreligious organizations around the country.\n      6\n        The panel’s concurrence in the denial of rehearing en banc\nlargely echoes Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in Wheaton College.\nCompare Panel Concurrence at 5 (“In no respect do we, nor could\nwe, question Plaintiffs’ sincere beliefs about what their faith\npermits and forbids of them. But we can and must decide which\nparty is right about how the law works.”), with Wheaton College,\n134 S. Ct. at 2812, slip op. at 10 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting)\n(“Wheaton is mistaken – not as a matter of religious faith, in which\nit is undoubtedly sincere, but as a matter of law . . . . Any provision\nof contraceptive coverage by Wheaton’s third-party administrator\nwould not result from any action by Wheaton; rather, in every\nmeaningful sense, it would result from the relevant law and\nregulations.”). But the Supreme Court, by a 6-3 margin, did not\nagree with Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in Wheaton College, at least\nfor purposes of the injunction. The Court instead granted an\ninjunction under the All Writs Act to Wheaton College, which the\nCourt could do only if it concluded that the required form\n“indisputably” would impose a substantial burden on Wheaton\nCollege’s exercise of religion. See Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc. v. Federal Communications Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1303\n(1993) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Wheaton College, 134 S.

But the panel opinion has been faked\nout by the Government’s accommodation.                      The\naccommodation provides an alternative, but the alternative\nitself imposes a substantial burden on the religious\norganizations’ exercise of religion. Again, this case arises in\na “Do X or Y or pay a penalty” posture. All agree that X –\nproviding contraceptive coverage – infringes plaintiffs’\nexercise of religion. But so does Y – submitting the form.\nWhat the panel opinion misses is that submitting this form is\nitself an act that contravenes the organizations’ sincere\nreligious beliefs. It is no different from the recent Holt case,\nin which the act that contravened the Muslim prisoner’s\nsincere religious beliefs was shaving his beard. Submitting\nthe form = shaving your beard. Or the Yoder case, in which\nthe act that contravened the Amish parents’ beliefs was\nsending their children to high school. Submitting the form =\nsending your children to high school. Or the Lee case, in\nwhich the act that contravened the Amish employer’s\nreligious beliefs was paying Social Security taxes.\nSubmitting the form = paying the Social Security tax. Or the\nSherbert case, in which the act that contravened the Seventh-\nday Adventist’s belief was working on Saturday, the Sabbath\nday of the faith. Submitting the form = working on the\nSabbath.\n\n     In all of those cases, the Supreme Court recognized that\nthe act in question represented a sincere religious belief that\nthe Government could not override except by employing the\nleast restrictive means to further a compelling governmental\ninterest. The same is true here. The panel opinion does not\nfully come to grips with that critical point, in my view.\n\n     The panel opinion therefore also does not appreciate that\nthe substantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion comes\nfrom the monetary penalty (which in this case happens to be\n\f                              15\nhuge) that the organizations will have to pay if they adhere to\ntheir religious beliefs and do not submit the required form. In\nHolt, the substantial burden came from the discipline the\nprisoner would receive if he refused to shave his beard. In\nYoder, it was the $5 monetary fine for the parents whose\nchildren did not attend high school. In Lee, it was the\nmonetary penalty for failure to pay taxes. In Sherbert, it was\nthe denial of unemployment benefits for not working on the\nSabbath.\n\n    The essential principle is crystal clear: When the\nGovernment forces someone to take an action contrary to his\nor her sincere religious belief (here, submitting the form) or\nelse suffer a financial penalty (which here is huge), the\nGovernment has substantially burdened the individual’s\nexercise of religion. So it is in this case.\n\n     To be clear, that conclusion does not mean that plaintiffs\nprevail on their RFRA claim. Rather, it means only that they\nprevail on the first prong of the three-part RFRA inquiry and\nthat we now must move on to the second and third prongs.\nThe Government may still be able to compel plaintiffs to\nsubmit the required form if the Government prevails on those\nsecond and third prongs. Cf. Lee, 455 U.S. at 257, 261\n(Government may force Amish employer to pay Social\nSecurity taxes notwithstanding substantial burden on Amish\nemployer’s religion).\n\n                               II\n\n     Second, does the Government have a compelling interest\nin facilitating women’s access to contraception – in particular,\nin facilitating access to contraception for the employees of\nthese religious organizations?

As I\nsee it, however, plaintiffs’ argument cannot be squared with\nthe views expressed by a majority of the Justices in Hobby\nLobby.\n\n     To begin with, how do we determine whether the\nGovernment has a “compelling interest” in overriding a\nfundamental constitutional or statutory right such as RFRA’s\nright to religious freedom? Good question. No code or\nhistory book lists the Government’s compelling interests.\nRather, courts have developed those interests over time, in\ncommon-law-like fashion. 7 What we do know, to put it in\ncolloquial and somewhat question-begging terms, is that the\nasserted governmental interest must be so critically important\nthat it justifies overriding certain fundamental individual\nrights in certain circumstances.

Justice\nKennedy strongly suggested in his Hobby Lobby concurring\nopinion – which appears to be controlling de facto if not also\nde jure on this particular issue – that the Government\ngenerally has a compelling interest in facilitating access to\ncontraception for women employees. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.\nCt. at 2785-86, slip op. at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see\nalso id. at 2779-80, slip op. at 39-40 (majority opinion); id. at\n2799-2801, slip op. at 23-27 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); cf.\nMarks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1977). In\nparticular, Justice Kennedy referred to the “premise” of the\nCourt’s decision: namely, its “assumption” that the\n\n    8\n       As noted above, at least three aspects of RFRA limit the\nstatute’s reach and thus help answer the parade of horribles\nsometimes raised in opposition to religious freedom claims. First,\nRFRA covers only religious objections.           Second, insincere\nreligious claims are excluded from RFRA’s protection. Third,\nRFRA’s compelling interest standard allows the Government to\ncompel or proscribe action in certain circumstances even though, by\ndoing so, the Government may be substantially burdening\nsomeone’s religion.\n\f                                18\nGovernment has a “legitimate and compelling interest” in\nfacilitating access to contraception. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct.\nat 2786, slip op. at 2 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice\nKennedy’s use of the term “compelling” in this context was\nno doubt carefully considered. And the four dissenting\nJustices likewise stated that the Government had a compelling\ninterest in facilitating women’s access to contraception. Id. at\n2799-2801, slip op. at 23-27 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n\n     It is not difficult to comprehend why a majority of the\nJustices in Hobby Lobby (Justice Kennedy plus the four\ndissenters) would suggest that the Government has a\ncompelling interest in facilitating women’s access to\ncontraception. About 50% of all pregnancies in the United\nStates are unintended. The large number of unintended\npregnancies causes significant social and economic costs. To\nalleviate those costs, the Federal Government has long sought\nto reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, including\nthrough the Affordable Care Act by making contraceptives\nmore cheaply and widely available. It is commonly accepted\nthat reducing the number of unintended pregnancies would\nfurther women’s health, advance women’s personal and\nprofessional opportunities, reduce the number of abortions,9\nand help break a cycle of poverty that persists when women\nwho cannot afford or obtain contraception become pregnant\nunintentionally at a young age. In light of the numerous\nbenefits that would follow from reducing the number of\nunintended pregnancies, it comes as no surprise that Justice\nKennedy’s opinion expressly referred to a “compelling”\ngovernmental interest in facilitating women’s access to\ncontraception.\n\n\n    9\n     As the panel opinion in this case accurately pointed out, as of\nnow about 40% of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n\f                                19\n    In short, even if the Court did not formally hold as much,\nHobby Lobby at least strongly suggests that the Government\nhas a compelling interest in facilitating access to\ncontraception for the employees of these religious\norganizations. 10\n\n                                III\n\n     Third, in light of those two conclusions, we must\nconsider the least restrictive means issue. When, as here, a\nlaw substantially burdens the exercise of religion, but the law\nfurthers a compelling governmental interest, RFRA requires\nthe Government to use the “least restrictive means of\nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(b). The Supreme Court has emphasized that the\n“least-restrictive-means      standard    is     exceptionally\ndemanding.” Burwell v.

As a leading First Amendment scholar has put\n    10\n        Justice Kennedy’s Hobby Lobby opinion did not expressly\ndiscuss whether a compelling governmental interest in ensuring\ngeneral coverage for contraceptives encompasses ensuring coverage\nfor those specific drugs and services that, some believe, operate as\nabortifacients and result in the destruction of embryos.\n\f                               20\nit: “If there’s some way of granting an exemption and yet\naccomplishing the government’s goal, then there’s no real\nneed to interfere with the religious practice, so the exemption\nmust be granted.” Eugene Volokh, The First Amendment and\nRelated Statutes 986 (5th ed. 2014).\n\n     Requiring religious organizations to submit the form\nmandated by current federal regulations is not the\nGovernment’s least restrictive means of furthering its interest\nin facilitating access to contraception for the organizations’\nemployees. That is because the Government can still achieve\nits interest by allowing the religious organizations to submit\nthe less restrictive notice that the Supreme Court has already\ntwice indicated should be good enough to satisfy the\nGovernment’s interest.\n\n     In the Wheaton College and Little Sisters of the Poor\ncases, the Supreme Court carefully specified that the religious\norganizations would satisfy their current legal obligations by\nsubmitting a simple notice to the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services “in writing that it is a nonprofit organization\nthat holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.” Wheaton\nCollege v.

See Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Br. 10. And even with\nthe less detailed Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice, the Government can independently determine the\nidentity of the organizations’ insurers and thereby ensure that\nthe insurers provide contraceptive coverage to the\norganizations’ employees.        The Wheaton College/Little\nSisters of the Poor notice may create some administrative\ninconvenience for the Government, because the Government\nitself will have to identify the religious organizations’\ninsurers. But administrative inconvenience alone does not\nnegate the feasibility of an otherwise less restrictive means –\nunless the administrative problem would be “of such\nmagnitude” that it would render “the entire statutory scheme\nunworkable.” Sherbert v.

That\nquestion matters because the Supreme Court has stated that\n“courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.” Cutter v.\nWilkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720 (2005) (applying the related\n\f                               22\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act). In\nHobby Lobby, the Court reiterated that this consideration\n“will often inform the analysis of the Government’s\ncompelling interest and the availability of a less restrictive\nmeans of advancing that interest.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct.\nat 2781 n.37, slip op. at 42 n.37. As Justice Kennedy put it in\nhis concurrence, the accommodation must not “unduly restrict\nother persons, such as employees, in protecting their own\ninterests.” Id. at 2787, slip op. at 4 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n      But here, the religious organizations’ employees would\nstill receive the same insurance coverage from the same\ninsurer for contraceptives. As the Supreme Court explained\nin its Wheaton College order: “Nothing in this interim order\naffects the ability of the applicant’s employees and students to\nobtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved\ncontraceptives” or “precludes the Government from relying\non this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to\nfacilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage under\nthe Act.” Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2807, slip op. at 1-2.\nSo accommodating the religious organizations by allowing\nthem to use the Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice would not, to use Justice Kennedy’s formulation,\n“unduly restrict” third parties. Cf. Douglas NeJaime & Reva\nB. Siegel, Conscience Wars: Complicity-Based Conscience\nClaims in Religion and Politics, 124 Yale L.J., at 116\n(forthcoming 2015) (version of Apr. 10, 2015) (“Wheaton\nCollege, like Hobby Lobby, appears to tie accommodation to\nthe fact that the government has other ways of providing for\nthe statute’s intended beneficiaries so that no third-party harm\nwould result from the accommodation.”).\n\n     Although the Supreme Court’s Wheaton College and\nLittle Sisters of the Poor orders were not final merits rulings,\nthey at least qualify as extremely strong signals from the\n\f                              23\nSupreme Court about how to resolve the least restrictive\nmeans issue in this case. In particular, the Court in Wheaton\nCollege granted an injunction under the All Writs Act, which\nis appropriate “only where the legal rights at issue are\nindisputably clear.” Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2808, slip\nop. at 4 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Moreover, the Court issued the Wheaton College\norder just days after its Hobby Lobby decision, and it did so\nover a detailed and forceful dissent.\n\n     In any event, regardless of whether we as a lower court\nare formally bound by the Supreme Court stay orders in\nWheaton College and Little Sisters of the Poor, the notice\nidentified by the Supreme Court in those two cases is\nundoubtedly a less restrictive way for the Government to\nfurther its interest than the form required by current federal\nregulations. It necessarily follows that the form required by\ncurrent regulations is not the “least restrictive means”\navailable to the Government. As the Supreme Court said a\nfew months ago in a similar context: If “a less restrictive\nmeans is available for the Government to achieve its goals,\nthe Government must use it.” Holt v. Hobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2771249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2771249/holt-v-hobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n864, slip op. at 11 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSo too here.\n\n     To be sure, some religious organizations claim that even\nthe less restrictive Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor\nnotice still imposes a substantial burden on their religious\nbeliefs. But that obviously does not help the Government’s\nargument in support of the current, even more burdensome\nform. The key point here is that the Wheaton College/Little\nSisters of the Poor notice is less restrictive (that is, less\nburdensome) than the currently required form and yet still\nfurthers the Government’s compelling interest. Under RFRA,\n\f                                  24\nthe Government therefore must employ that less restrictive\nmeans. 11\n\n     Put simply, the Government need not – and therefore\nunder RFRA may not – pursue its compelling interest in\nfacilitating access to contraception by requiring religious non-\nprofit organizations to submit the form required by current\nfederal regulations. 12\n\n\n\n     11\n         The Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice\nrequires a religious organization to, in effect, raise its hand to opt\nout. But contrary to what the panel’s concurrence in the denial of\nrehearing en banc says, see Panel Concurrence at 3-4 n.1, the\ncurrently required form requires a religious organization both to\nraise its hand and to point to its insurer. From the perspective of\nthe plaintiff religious organizations, the currently required form is\ntherefore more burdensome because it makes the organizations\nidentify or notify their insurers, which the organizations believe\nmakes them more complicit in the provision of contraceptive\ncoverage to which they object as a matter of religious belief.\n      12\n         As the Court in Hobby Lobby noted, the Government could\ndirectly subsidize or provide contraceptives to employees of\nreligious non-profit organizations. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n2780-81, slip op. at 41. The direct funding option raises certain\nfeasibility issues. A means that is not a reasonably feasible way of\nfurthering the Government’s interest cannot be deemed a less\nrestrictive means of furthering that interest. In Little Sisters of the\nPoor, Hobby Lobby, and Wheaton College, the Court did not say\nthat direct funding was the least restrictive means of furthering the\nGovernment’s interest.       If it had, then even the Wheaton\nCollege/Little Sisters of the Poor notice would itself be too\nrestrictive. In any event, what matters in the present case is that the\nWheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice is less restrictive\nthan the form required by the current federal regulations but still\nachieves the Government’s interest.\n\f                               25\n     One final note for clarity: The Government may of\ncourse continue to require the religious organizations’\ninsurers to provide contraceptive coverage to the religious\norganizations’ employees, even if the religious organizations\nobject. As Judge Flaum correctly explained, “RFRA does not\nauthorize religious organizations to dictate the independent\nactions of third-parties, even if the organization sincerely\ndisagrees with them.” University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">743</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 (7th Cir. 2014) (Flaum, J., dissenting),\nvacated and remanded, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). “That is true\nwhether the third-party is the government, an insurer, a\nstudent, or some other actor.” Id. “So long as the\ngovernment does not require” religious organizations\nthemselves “to take action, RFRA does not give” the religious\norganizations “a right to prevent the government from\nproviding contraceptives to” the religious organizations’\nemployees. Id.\n\n                             ***\n\n     In sum, I respectfully would grant rehearing en banc and\nrule for the plaintiff religious organizations on the ground that\nthe Wheaton College/Little Sisters of the Poor notice is a less\nrestrictive way than the currently mandated form for the\nGovernment to achieve its compelling interest in facilitating\naccess to contraception for the organizations’ employees.\n\f</pre>",
