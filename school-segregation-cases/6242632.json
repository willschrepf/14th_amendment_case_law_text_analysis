R. 32.1.\n\fBefore KELLY, PHILLIPS, and McHUGH, Circuit Judges.\n                  _________________________________\n\n      Kansas prisoner Joshua James Robertson is a Messianic Jew housed in\n\nlong-term administrative segregation. He brought suit under the Religious Land Use\n\nand Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc to 2000cc-5,\n\nalleging that restrictions in segregation substantially burdened his religious exercise\n\nby preventing him from hearing the Bible read aloud to him. He asked to be allowed\n\nto possess a “my-iBible,” an MP3 player loaded with an audio recording of the Bible.\n\nThe district court dismissed the action for failure to show a substantial burden on\n\nreligious exercise, but this court reversed and remanded for further proceedings,\n\nRobertson v. Biby, 647 F. App’x 893, 898 (10th Cir. 2016).\n\n      After the remand, prison officials decided to allow Mr. Robertson to possess\n\nthe my-iBible and related accessories such as earbud headphones on certain\n\nconditions, including that he not use them in violation of the law or prison policies\n\nand orders. The district court therefore granted the defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment based on mootness. The district court also denied Mr. Robertson’s motion\n\nfor an award of secretarial fees. Mr. Robertson appealed.\n\n      While this appeal was pending, prison officials seized Mr. Robertson’s\n\nearbuds. Mr. Robertson notified this court of the seizure in a motion for injunction\n\npending appeal. Prison officials responded that Mr. Robertson had been using the\n\nearbuds improperly to listen to an AM/FM mini-radio while out of his cell, in line to\n\nreceive medication. They attached documentation of a disciplinary hearing finding\n\n\n                                           2\n\fMr. Robertson guilty of violating prison policy and disobeying orders. In reply,\n\nMr. Robertson argued that the disciplinary documents failed to properly identify the\n\napplicable rule or order, but he did not contest the basic underlying facts—i.e., that\n\nhe was using the earbuds to listen to an AM/FM mini-radio while outside his cell.\n\n                                      ANALYSIS\n\nI.    Mootness\n\n      We review mootness de novo. Ghailani v. Sessions, 859 F.3d 1295, 1300\n\n(10th Cir. 2017). “Article III’s requirement that federal courts adjudicate only cases\n\nand controversies necessitates that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction where the\n\naward of any requested relief would be moot—i.e. where the controversy is no longer\n\nlive and ongoing.” Front Range Equine Rescue v. Vilsack, 782 F.3d 565, 568\n\n(10th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). “A case is moot . . . where the\n\nrelief sought can no longer be given or is no longer needed.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). When this case was in the district court, Mr. Robertson sought to be\n\nallowed to possess a my-iBible, and prison officials obliged. Thus, the relief\n\nMr. Robertson sought was no longer needed.\n\n      Nearly a year later, prison officials seized the earbuds, allegedly making it\n\nimpossible for Mr. Robertson to listen to his my-iBible. But these subsequent events\n\ndo not unmoot the case. When a case has become moot while in the district court, we\n\nwill not supplement the record with subsequent facts proffered in an effort to\n\ndemonstrate the case is not moot. Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of\n\nReclamation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1110 n.11 (10th Cir. 2010). If anything, the subsequent\n\n                                           3\n\fevents might create a new claim (although we express no opinion on that matter), but\n\nthey do not revive the instant suit.\n\n       Mr. Robertson suggests that other relief is available, in that he is indigent and\n\nthe prison’s property policy bars a third party from donating a replacement my-iBible\n\nor replacement headphones, chargers, or similar accessories. But even if a case is not\n\nconstitutionally moot, it may be prudentially moot. “Prudential mootness doctrine\n\noften makes its appearance in cases where a plaintiff starts off with a vital complaint\n\nbut then a coordinate branch of government steps in to promise the relief she seeks.”\n\nWinzler v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc., 681 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\nFor example, “[s]ometimes the plaintiff will seek an order forcing a department to\n\ntake an action that it eventually agrees to take voluntarily.” Id.\n\n       That was the situation here; prison officials did what Mr. Robertson originally\n\nrequested by allowing him to have the my-iBible and accessories. The appellees\n\nrepresented to the district court that the Kansas Department of Corrections would\n\nallow a third party to replace the my-iBible or accessories should they stop\n\nfunctioning. See R., Vol. III at 486. Accordingly, with regard to the claim\n\nMr. Robertson originally asserted, “there remain[ed] not enough value left for the\n\ncourts to add in this case to warrant carrying on with the business of deciding its\n\nmerits.” Winzler, 681 F.3d at 1211. And as with constitutional mootness, the\n\nsubsequent events do not undermine prudential mootness. In light of the disciplinary\n\nhearing, it seems unlikely at this point that prison officials will allow a third party to\n\nreplace the seized headphones. But again, if anything, that situation would create a\n\n                                             4\n\fdifferent claim than the one Mr. Robinson originally brought. While the parties may\n\nhave a dispute, it is a different dispute from the one that was before the district court.\n\n       Mr. Robertson also argues that the case is not moot because in addition to the\n\nmy-iBible, his complaint requested a television and a radio. During the litigation,\n\nhowever, Mr. Robertson made it patently clear that (1) his goal was to possess the\n\nmy-iBible, and (2) his religious needs would not be satisfied by a television or a\n\nradio. See R., Vol. I at 349, 417, 444, 497, 550, 561, 611, 613; R., Vol. III at 20;\n\nsee also Robertson, 647 F. App’x at 895 n.4 (“On appeal, Robertson contends that\n\ntelevision programs, radio broadcasts, telephone calls, and clergy visits are all\n\ninsufficient to satisfy his religious need to hear the Bible read aloud.”). He went so\n\nfar as to assert, both before and after the remand, that the case would be moot if he\n\nreceived the my-iBible. R., Vol. I at 418; R., Vol. III at 355. Having received his\n\nmy-iBible, Mr. Robertson cannot now try to keep this litigation on life-support by\n\nchanging his position and belatedly arguing that his religious needs also extend to a\n\ntelevision and a radio.1\n\nII.   Secretarial Fees\n\n       Mr. Robertson also appeals from the district court’s denial of his motion for an\n\naward of $13,600 in secretarial costs billed to him by his mother. The district court\n\nheld that, as a pro se litigant, he was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees,\n\n       1\n         Because this case is moot, we need not consider Mr. Robertson’s challenges\nto the district court’s (1) grant of an extension for the defendants to respond to a\nmotion for summary judgment and (2) denial of Mr. Robertson’s two motions for a\npreliminary injunction. With the case as a whole having been mooted, those\nquestions too are moot.\n                                            5\n\fwhich would include the costs of secretarial assistance. We review de novo that legal\n\nground for denial of a fee award. See ClearOne Commc’ns, Inc. v. Bowers, 643 F.3d\n\n735, 777 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n       We agree with the district court. A successful RLUIPA claimant may obtain a\n\nfee award under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). Bills for the work of legal secretaries come\n\nunder the purview of a § 1988 attorney’s fee award. See Missouri v. Jenkins ex rel.\n\nAgyei, 491 U.S. 274, 285 (1989) (holding that § 1988 fee award “must take into\n\naccount the work not only of attorneys, but also of secretaries, messengers, librarians,\n\njanitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an\n\nattorney bills her client”); see also Case v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 233, 157 F.3d 1243,\n\n1249 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that “the fees for attorneys, law clerks, and legal\n\nassistants are all determined in the same fashion” “under the rubric of” § 1988). But\n\nas a matter of law, a pro se litigant is not eligible for a § 1988 fee award. Kay v.\n\nEhrler, 499 U.S. 432, 435, 437-38 (1991); Turman v. Tuttle, 711 F.2d 148, 149\n\n(10th Cir. 1983) (per curiam). Mr. Robertson misplaces his reliance on Burt v.\n\nHennessey, 929 F.2d 457, 459 (9th Cir. 1991). Even assuming Burt survived Kay\n\n(which was issued soon after Burt was decided), Burt has never been adopted in this\n\ncircuit.2\n\n\n       2\n         In his reply brief, Mr. Robertson argues that “[e]ven if this Court were to\nhold Burt as ‘not good law’, . . . RLUIPA provides for an award of appropriate relief\nagainst a government [and] secretarial costs is an award of appropriate relief.” Reply\nBr. at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). We need not decide the question because\nMr. Robertson did not raise this argument in his opening brief. See Reedy v.\nWerholtz, 660 F.3d 1270, 1274 (10th Cir. 2011).\n                                            6\n\f                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      Mr. Robertson’s motion to proceed without prepayment of costs or fees is\n\ngranted. Mr. Robertson is reminded that under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b), he remains\n\nobligated to pay the full amount of the applicable fees. The motion for an injunction\n\npending appeal and the motion for an order requiring service are denied as moot.\n\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n                                            Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                            Gregory A.

Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1210 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\nFor example, “[s]ometimes the plaintiff will seek an order forcing a department to\n\ntake an action that it eventually agrees to take voluntarily.” Id.\n\n       That was the situation here; prison officials did what Mr. Robertson originally\n\nrequested by allowing him to have the my-iBible and accessories. The appellees\n\nrepresented to the district court that the Kansas Department of Corrections would\n\nallow a third party to replace the my-iBible or accessories should they stop\n\nfunctioning. See R., Vol. III at 486. Accordingly, with regard to the claim\n\nMr. Robertson originally asserted, “there remain[ed] not enough value left for the\n\ncourts to add in this case to warrant carrying on with the business of deciding its\n\nmerits.” Winzler, 681 F.3d at 1211. And as with constitutional mootness, the\n\nsubsequent events do not undermine prudential mootness. In light of the disciplinary\n\nhearing, it seems unlikely at this point that prison officials will allow a third party to\n\nreplace the seized headphones. But again, if anything, that situation would create a\n\n                                             4\n\fdifferent claim than the one Mr. Robinson originally brought. While the parties may\n\nhave a dispute, it is a different dispute from the one that was before the district court.\n\n       Mr. Robertson also argues that the case is not moot because in addition to the\n\nmy-iBible, his complaint requested a television and a radio. During the litigation,\n\nhowever, Mr. Robertson made it patently clear that (1) his goal was to possess the\n\nmy-iBible, and (2) his religious needs would not be satisfied by a television or a\n\nradio. See R., Vol. I at 349, 417, 444, 497, 550, 561, 611, 613; R., Vol. III at 20;\n\nsee also Robertson, 647 F. App’x at 895 n.4 (“On appeal, Robertson contends that\n\ntelevision programs, radio broadcasts, telephone calls, and clergy visits are all\n\ninsufficient to satisfy his religious need to hear the Bible read aloud.”). He went so\n\nfar as to assert, both before and after the remand, that the case would be moot if he\n\nreceived the my-iBible. R., Vol. I at 418; R., Vol. III at 355. Having received his\n\nmy-iBible, Mr. Robertson cannot now try to keep this litigation on life-support by\n\nchanging his position and belatedly arguing that his religious needs also extend to a\n\ntelevision and a radio.1\n\nII.   Secretarial Fees\n\n       Mr. Robertson also appeals from the district court’s denial of his motion for an\n\naward of $13,600 in secretarial costs billed to him by his mother. The district court\n\nheld that, as a pro se litigant, he was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees,\n\n       1\n         Because this case is moot, we need not consider Mr. Robertson’s challenges\nto the district court’s (1) grant of an extension for the defendants to respond to a\nmotion for summary judgment and (2) denial of Mr. Robertson’s two motions for a\npreliminary injunction. With the case as a whole having been mooted, those\nquestions too are moot.\n                                            5\n\fwhich would include the costs of secretarial assistance. We review de novo that legal\n\nground for denial of a fee award. See ClearOne Commc’ns, Inc. v. Bowers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403365\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403365/clearone-communications-inc-v-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n       We agree with the district court. A successful RLUIPA claimant may obtain a\n\nfee award under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). Bills for the work of legal secretaries come\n\nunder the purview of a § 1988 attorney’s fee award. See Missouri v. Jenkins ex rel.\n\nAgyei, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112299\"><a href=\"/opinion/112299/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (1989) (holding that § 1988 fee award “must take into\n\naccount the work not only of attorneys, but also of secretaries, messengers, librarians,\n\njanitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an\n\nattorney bills her client”); see also Case v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 233, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156986\"><a href=\"/opinion/156986/case-v-unified-school-233/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1249 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that “the fees for attorneys, law clerks, and legal\n\nassistants are all determined in the same fashion” “under the rubric of” § 1988). But\n\nas a matter of law, a pro se litigant is not eligible for a § 1988 fee award.

Even assuming Burt survived Kay\n\n(which was issued soon after Burt was decided), Burt has never been adopted in this\n\ncircuit.2\n\n\n       2\n         In his reply brief, Mr. Robertson argues that “[e]ven if this Court were to\nhold Burt as ‘not good law’, . . . RLUIPA provides for an award of appropriate relief\nagainst a government [and] secretarial costs is an award of appropriate relief.” Reply\nBr. at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). We need not decide the question because\nMr. Robertson did not raise this argument in his opening brief. See Reedy v.\nWerholtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"617037\"><a href=\"/opinion/617037/reedy-v-werholtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1274 (10th Cir. 2011).\n                                            6\n\f                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      Mr. Robertson’s motion to proceed without prepayment of costs or fees is\n\ngranted. Mr. Robertson is reminded that under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b), he remains\n\nobligated to pay the full amount of the applicable fees. The motion for an injunction\n\npending appeal and the motion for an order requiring service are denied as moot.\n\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n                                            Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                            Gregory A.
