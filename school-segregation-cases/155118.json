For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the\n\njudgment of the District Court.\n\n       In December 2008, Washington-El filed a complaint, which he amended several\n\ntimes, against numerous Department of Corrections (“DOC”) officials and employees.\n\nHis allegations can generally be divided into two categories: (1) due process claims\n\nrelated to his initial placement and continued confinement in administrative custody, and\n\n(2) constitutional challenges to the conditions of his confinement. The violations\n\nallegedly occurred while Washington-El was incarcerated at SCI-Houtzdale (June 2007\n\nthrough February 2008) and SCI-Fayette (February 2008 through November 2009).\n\nFollowing a Magistrate Judge’s entry of Reports and Recommendations, the District\n\nCourt – in three separate orders – granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss and their\n\nmotion for summary judgment. After the District Court denied Washington-El’s motion\n\nfor reconsideration, he appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.1 “We review district court\n\ndecisions regarding both summary judgment and dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\n\n1\n  The District Court rejected Washington-El’s last remaining claims by final order and\njudgment entered on March 28, 2013. Washington-El filed a timely motion for\nreconsideration on April 10, 2013, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), thereby tolling the time for\nfiling an appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). The District Court denied\nreconsideration on July 12, 2013. Washington-El submitted his notice of appeal to prison\nofficials for mailing 27 days later, on August 8, 2013. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A);\n                                              2\n\funder the same de novo standard of review.” Barefoot Architect, Inc. v. Bunge, 632 F.3d\n\n822, 826 (3d Cir. 2011). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain\n\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n\nface.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nSummary judgment is proper where, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party and drawing all inferences in favor of that party, there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Kaucher v. Cnty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 422-23 (3d Cir.\n\n2006). We review the District Court’s decision on a motion for reconsideration for abuse\n\nof discretion. See Max’s Seafood Café ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669,\n\n673 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n       On June 13, 2007, Washington-El was transferred from SCI-Graterford to SCI-\n\nHoutzdale, where, for the majority of his eight-month incarceration there, he was held in\n\nadministrative custody.2 He was placed on the Restricted Release List (“RRL”) in\n\n\n\n4(c)(1); Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 276 (1988). Therefore, the notice of appeal was\ntimely as to both the denial of reconsideration and the order granting summary judgment.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Moreover, we now also have jurisdiction to review\nthe District Court’s prior orders granting in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss. See\nHead v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Tr., 225 F.3d 794, 800 (7th Cir. 2000) (holding that\nruling on motion to dismiss which did not dispose of all claims was rendered appealable\nwhen District Court later entered summary judgment resolving all outstanding claims).\n2\n  With respect to Washington-El’s claim that his initial placement in administrative\ncustody at SCI-Houtzdale violated his due process rights, the District Court properly held\nthat he lacked a protected interest in such placement. See Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S.\n78, 88 n.9 (1976) (explaining that prisoners have no legitimate due process concerns in\n                                                3\n\fJanuary 2008, signifying that he could be released from administrative custody only upon\n\nprior approval of the Secretary of Corrections. In February 2008, Washington-El was\n\ntransferred to SCI-Fayette, where his placement in administrative custody and inclusion\n\non the RRL continued. In total, Washington-El was in administrative custody and/or\n\nincluded on the RRL during approximately 26 of the 28 months he was incarcerated in\n\nSCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette.\n\n       Washington-El alleged that his continued administrative custody and RRL\n\nclassifications violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. Assuming that the circumstances of his incarceration are sufficient to\n\ntrigger procedural due process rights, Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995),\n\nWashington-El has failed to demonstrate that he was not afforded proper due process\n\nprotections. We have held that periodic review of inmates indefinitely confined to\n\nadministrative custody meets due process requirements. Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140,\n\n147 (3d Cir. 2000). Here, Washington-El was timely informed that he was placed in\n\nadministrative custody and included on the RRL because he was considered an escape\n\nrisk. In addition, his numerous challenges to his custody status, both formal and\n\ninformal, were regularly reviewed by members of the Program Review Committee\n\n(“PRC”) at SCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette. See id. at 144 (holding that a prisoner who\n\n\n\ntheir prison classifications). We also note that a challenge to Washington-El’s placement\nin administrative custody at SCI-Graterford, as well as other claims, is the subject of a\nseparate action filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. See Washington-El v.\nDiGuglielmo, E.D. Pa. Civ. No. 06-cv-04517.\n                                            4\n\fwas placed in administrative custody for eight years was afforded all the process he was\n\ndue because “an ‘informal, nonadversary review’ at which the prisoner has the\n\nopportunity to state his views, satisfies the requirements of due process” (quoting Hewitt\n\nv. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 472 (1983))). Moreover, the summary judgment record belies\n\nWashington-El’s assertion that the periodic reviews were perfunctory, and thus\n\ninadequate. See Sourbeer v. Robinson, 791 F.2d 1094, 1101 (3d Cir. 1986) (holding that\n\ndue process violation occurred where prison officials applied justifications for\n\nsegregation in “rote fashion”). During those reviews, prison officials considered the\n\nstatus of an investigation concerning a possible escape plan involving Washington-El,\n\nreviewed the results of that investigation, assessed whether to recommend Washington-El\n\nfor release to the general population, and responded to his arguments for release from\n\nadministrative custody. Finally, it is difficult to conclude that review was not meaningful\n\nwhere, following Washington-El’s contention that the investigation was being\n\nintentionally delayed, he was released from administrative custody for approximately two\n\nmonths.\n\n       We also agree with the District Court that Washington-El failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to his remaining claims, all of which concern his\n\nconditions of confinement, rather than his continued placement in administrative custody.\n\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), inmates must exhaust their\n\nadministrative remedies before filing a suit alleging specific acts of unconstitutional\n\nconduct by prison officials. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). A prisoner must exhaust these\n                                              5\n\fremedies “in the literal sense”; no further avenues in the prison’s grievance process\n\nshould be available. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 232 (3d Cir. 2004). “[I]t is the\n\nprison’s requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper\n\nexhaustion.” Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007). The DOC has an Inmate\n\nGrievance System, which permits inmates to seek review of issues relating to their\n\nconfinement, see DC-ADM 804, and a separate policy regarding Administrative Custody\n\nProcedures, which allows inmates to challenge initial and continued administrative\n\ncustody placement, see DC-ADM 802.\n\n       An affidavit prepared by the DOC custodian of inmate grievance records indicated\n\nthat, while confined at SCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette, Washington-El appealed to final\n\nreview eight grievances brought under DC-ADM 804. After thoroughly reviewing the\n\nrecord, we agree with the District Court that none of those grievances pertained to the\n\nconditions of confinement claims that he raised in the this lawsuit. Washington-El\n\nargued, however, that his remaining claims were administratively exhausted through\n\ngrievances that he filed pursuant to DC-ADM 802. Importantly, however, the regulatory\n\nscheme that was in effect during the relevant time period provided that DC-ADM 802\n\ngoverned challenges only to initial or continued confinement in administrative custody;\n\nDC-ADM 804 remained applicable to challenges unrelated to custody status.3\n\n\n3\n DOC regulations provided “access to a formal procedure through which the resolution\nof problems or other issues of concern arising during the course of confinement may be\nsought.” DC-ADM 804 § V (2004). But this general provision was subject to an\nexception which stated that “[i]nitial review of issues relating to the following\n                                             6\n\fWashington-El also claimed that DOC officials advised him that he could not use DC-\n\nADM 804 to grieve issues related to the conditions of his confinement in administrative\n\ncustody. But such advice allegedly occurred in January 2011, after Washington-El had\n\nbeen transferred from SCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette. Furthermore, while confined in\n\nthose facilities, Washington-El did use DC-ADM 804 to challenge conditions of his\n\nadministrative custody, other than those raised in his complaints.\n\n       Under these circumstances, we conclude that Washington-El failed to state a due\n\nprocess claim concerning his continued confinement in administrative custody and failed\n\nto exhaust his administrative remedies as to his conditions of confinement claims. In\n\naddition, we discern no abuse of discretion in the District Court’s denial of the motion for\n\nreconsideration, as Washington-El’s arguments did not serve “to correct manifest errors\n\nof law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.” Harsco Corp. v. Zlotnicki, 779\n\n\n\n\nDepartment policies shall be in accordance with procedures outlines therein[:] . . . DC-\nADM 802, Administrative Custody Procedures.” DC-ADM 804 § IV, ¶ H. The\nregulations pertaining to administrative custody, in turn, provided that “[a]n inmate may\nappeal the decision of the PRC concerning his/her initial confinement in [administrative\ncustody] to the Facility Manager/designee” and thereafter “may appeal the . . . decision\n. . . to continue him/her in [administrative custody] . . . to the Office of the Chief Hearing\nExaminer.” DC-ADM 802 § 2, ¶¶ C.1 and C.2 (2008). In 2011, after the relevant time\nperiod in this case, DC-ADM 802 was amended to provide that “[a]ll issues concerning\nan inmate’s placement in [administrative] custody or the duration, conditions or other\ncircumstances of his/her [administrative custody] status must be addressed through the\nprocedures set for in this directive and may not be addressed through the procedures set\nforth in DC-ADM 801 [pertaining to disciplinary proceedings] or DC-ADM 804.” DC-\nADM 802 § 2, ¶ D.9 (emphasis added).\n\n                                              7\n\fF.2d 906, 909 (3d Cir. 1985). Therefore, we will affirm the judgment of the District\n\nCourt.4\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Washington El’s Motion for Appointment of Counsel is denied.\n                                            8\n\f",

Therefore, the notice of appeal was\ntimely as to both the denial of reconsideration and the order granting summary judgment.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Moreover, we now also have jurisdiction to review\nthe District Court’s prior orders granting in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss. See\nHead v. Chicago Sch.

See Moody v. Daggett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109560\"><a href=\"/opinion/109560/moody-v-daggett/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 n.9 (1976) (explaining that prisoners have no legitimate due process concerns in\n                                                3\n\fJanuary 2008, signifying that he could be released from administrative custody only upon\n\nprior approval of the Secretary of Corrections. In February 2008, Washington-El was\n\ntransferred to SCI-Fayette, where his placement in administrative custody and inclusion\n\non the RRL continued. In total, Washington-El was in administrative custody and/or\n\nincluded on the RRL during approximately 26 of the 28 months he was incarcerated in\n\nSCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette.\n\n       Washington-El alleged that his continued administrative custody and RRL\n\nclassifications violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. Assuming that the circumstances of his incarceration are sufficient to\n\ntrigger procedural due process rights, Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995),\n\nWashington-El has failed to demonstrate that he was not afforded proper due process\n\nprotections. We have held that periodic review of inmates indefinitely confined to\n\nadministrative custody meets due process requirements. Shoats v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768788\"><a href=\"/opinion/768788/russell-shoats-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-the-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n147 (3d Cir. 2000). Here, Washington-El was timely informed that he was placed in\n\nadministrative custody and included on the RRL because he was considered an escape\n\nrisk. In addition, his numerous challenges to his custody status, both formal and\n\ninformal, were regularly reviewed by members of the Program Review Committee\n\n(“PRC”) at SCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette. See id. at 144 (holding that a prisoner who\n\n\n\ntheir prison classifications). We also note that a challenge to Washington-El’s placement\nin administrative custody at SCI-Graterford, as well as other claims, is the subject of a\nseparate action filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. See Washington-El v.\nDiGuglielmo, E.D. Pa. Civ. No. 06-cv-04517.\n                                            4\n\fwas placed in administrative custody for eight years was afforded all the process he was\n\ndue because “an ‘informal, nonadversary review’ at which the prisoner has the\n\nopportunity to state his views, satisfies the requirements of due process” (quoting Hewitt\n\nv.

Moreover, the summary judgment record belies\n\nWashington-El’s assertion that the periodic reviews were perfunctory, and thus\n\ninadequate. See Sourbeer v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470972\"><a href=\"/opinion/470972/sourbeer-gregory-s-in-no-85-5273-v-robinson-william-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1101 (3d Cir. 1986) (holding that\n\ndue process violation occurred where prison officials applied justifications for\n\nsegregation in “rote fashion”). During those reviews, prison officials considered the\n\nstatus of an investigation concerning a possible escape plan involving Washington-El,\n\nreviewed the results of that investigation, assessed whether to recommend Washington-El\n\nfor release to the general population, and responded to his arguments for release from\n\nadministrative custody. Finally, it is difficult to conclude that review was not meaningful\n\nwhere, following Washington-El’s contention that the investigation was being\n\nintentionally delayed, he was released from administrative custody for approximately two\n\nmonths.\n\n       We also agree with the District Court that Washington-El failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to his remaining claims, all of which concern his\n\nconditions of confinement, rather than his continued placement in administrative custody.\n\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), inmates must exhaust their\n\nadministrative remedies before filing a suit alleging specific acts of unconstitutional\n\nconduct by prison officials. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). A prisoner must exhaust these\n                                              5\n\fremedies “in the literal sense”; no further avenues in the prison’s grievance process\n\nshould be available. Spruill v. Gillis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786604\"><a href=\"/opinion/786604/robert-spruill-v-frank-gillis-goolier-co-mcglaughlin-md-brown-pa/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (3d Cir. 2004). “[I]t is the\n\nprison’s requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper\n\nexhaustion.” Jones v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (2007). The DOC has an Inmate\n\nGrievance System, which permits inmates to seek review of issues relating to their\n\nconfinement, see DC-ADM 804, and a separate policy regarding Administrative Custody\n\nProcedures, which allows inmates to challenge initial and continued administrative\n\ncustody placement, see DC-ADM 802.\n\n       An affidavit prepared by the DOC custodian of inmate grievance records indicated\n\nthat, while confined at SCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette, Washington-El appealed to final\n\nreview eight grievances brought under DC-ADM 804. After thoroughly reviewing the\n\nrecord, we agree with the District Court that none of those grievances pertained to the\n\nconditions of confinement claims that he raised in the this lawsuit. Washington-El\n\nargued, however, that his remaining claims were administratively exhausted through\n\ngrievances that he filed pursuant to DC-ADM 802. Importantly, however, the regulatory\n\nscheme that was in effect during the relevant time period provided that DC-ADM 802\n\ngoverned challenges only to initial or continued confinement in administrative custody;\n\nDC-ADM 804 remained applicable to challenges unrelated to custody status.3\n\n\n3\n DOC regulations provided “access to a formal procedure through which the resolution\nof problems or other issues of concern arising during the course of confinement may be\nsought.” DC-ADM 804 § V (2004). But this general provision was subject to an\nexception which stated that “[i]nitial review of issues relating to the following\n                                             6\n\fWashington-El also claimed that DOC officials advised him that he could not use DC-\n\nADM 804 to grieve issues related to the conditions of his confinement in administrative\n\ncustody. But such advice allegedly occurred in January 2011, after Washington-El had\n\nbeen transferred from SCI-Houtzdale and SCI-Fayette. Furthermore, while confined in\n\nthose facilities, Washington-El did use DC-ADM 804 to challenge conditions of his\n\nadministrative custody, other than those raised in his complaints.\n\n       Under these circumstances, we conclude that Washington-El failed to state a due\n\nprocess claim concerning his continued confinement in administrative custody and failed\n\nto exhaust his administrative remedies as to his conditions of confinement claims. In\n\naddition, we discern no abuse of discretion in the District Court’s denial of the motion for\n\nreconsideration, as Washington-El’s arguments did not serve “to correct manifest errors\n\nof law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.” Harsco Corp. v. Zlotnicki, 779\n\n\n\n\nDepartment policies shall be in accordance with procedures outlines therein[:] . . . DC-\nADM 802, Administrative Custody Procedures.” DC-ADM 804 § IV, ¶ H. The\nregulations pertaining to administrative custody, in turn, provided that “[a]n inmate may\nappeal the decision of the PRC concerning his/her initial confinement in [administrative\ncustody] to the Facility Manager/designee” and thereafter “may appeal the . . . decision\n. . . to continue him/her in [administrative custody] . . . to the Office of the Chief Hearing\nExaminer.” DC-ADM 802 § 2, ¶¶ C.1 and C.2 (2008). In 2011, after the relevant time\nperiod in this case, DC-ADM 802 was amended to provide that “[a]ll issues concerning\nan inmate’s placement in [administrative] custody or the duration, conditions or other\ncircumstances of his/her [administrative custody] status must be addressed through the\nprocedures set for in this directive and may not be addressed through the procedures set\nforth in DC-ADM 801 [pertaining to disciplinary proceedings] or DC-ADM 804.” DC-\nADM 802 § 2, ¶ D.9 (emphasis added).\n\n                                              </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 909 (3d Cir. 1985).
