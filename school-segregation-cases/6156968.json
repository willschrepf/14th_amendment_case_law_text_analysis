(Count I), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title\n\nVII”), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (Count II), 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (“Section 1981”) (Count III),\n\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), see 29 U.S.C. § 623 et seq. (Count IV),\n\nand the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”), see D.C. Code § 2-1401 et seq.\n\n(Count V). He also brings a breach of contract claim (Count VI). Plaintiff demands declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, litigation expenses and reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n       This matter is before the Court on Defendant District of Columbia Water and Sewer\n\nAuthority’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 18. For the reasons discussed below, the\n\nCourt concludes that plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and the DCHRA are time-barred, that\n\nplaintiff failed to exhaust his age and race discrimination claims under the ADEA and Title VII,\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fthat DC Water did not violate Section 1981 by purposely discriminating against plaintiff on the\n\nbasis of his race, and that plaintiff fails to state a breach of contract claim. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt will grant DC Water’s motion in its entirety.\n\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff is a 55-year old African American man, Pl.’s First Am. Compl., ECF No. 17\n\n(“Am. Compl.”) ¶ 4, who is dyslexic, see id. ¶ 9. DC Water “is an independent authority of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia that provides retail water and wastewater sewer service to the District of\n\nColumbia.” Id. ¶ 5. Its predecessor entity, the District of Columbia Department of Public\n\nWorks, Water and Sewer Administration, hired plaintiff in 1988 as an Electrical Equipment\n\nRepairer 11/CDL. Id. ¶ 6.\n\n       An Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL “perform[ed] a wide range of electrical duties\n\nindependently under the supervision of an electrical foreman.” Def. District of Columbia Water\n\nand Sewer Auth.’s Mem. of P. & A. in Support of its Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 18-1 (“Def.’s\n\nMem.”), Decl. of Charles Sweeney in Support of Def. District of Columbia Water and Sewer\n\nAuth.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 18-3 (“Sweeney Decl.”) ¶ 8. 1 Each person in this position\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiff deems Mr. Sweeney’s declaration inadmissible hearsay evidence which the Court\nshould not consider. See, e.g., Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to\nDef.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 21-1 ¶¶ 4-7. The Court disagrees. A “declaration used to\nsupport . . . a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be\nadmissible in evidence, and show that the . . . declarant is competent to testify on the matters\nstated.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Mr. Sweeney is the Director of Distribution and Conveyance\nSystems at DC Water, Sweeney Decl. ¶ 2, and was involved with the planning an execution of\nthe reorganization and consolidation of the Departments of Sewer, Water and Sewer Pump\nMaintenance into a single Department of Distribution and Conveyance Systems, id. ¶ 4. These\nare the circumstances under which plaintiff’s claims arose, about which Mr. Sweeney has\npersonal knowledge and about which Mr. Sweeney is competent to testify. DC Water “is not\nrequired to produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial” at the summary\njudgment stage, as long as “the evidence [is] capable of being converted into admissible\nevidence.” Gleklen v. Democratic Cong. Campaign Comm., Inc., 199 F.3d 1365, 1369 (D.C.\n                                                  2\n\fwas “only required to hold an apprentice electrician’s license and a Commercial Driver’s License\n\n[(CDL)].” Sweeney Decl. ¶ 8; see id., Ex. 1 (Job Description, Electrical Equipment Repairer\n\n11/CDL) at 2. “Throughout his employment with DC Water, [plaintiff] had an [a]pprentice\n\n[e]lectrician[’s] license and a Class B [CDL.] ” Am. Compl. ¶ 6.\n\n       In or about 2011, DC Water planned to reorganize and consolidate its “Department of\n\nWater, Department of Sewer, and the Water and Sewer Pump Maintenance Branch into one\n\ndepartment called the Department of Distribution and Conveyance Systems.” Sweeney Decl. ¶\n\n4. Management identified positions to abolish and identified “new positions . . . to create to\n\nreplace the abolished positions and/or meet new organizational requirements.” Id. ¶ 6. One of\n\nthe positions slated for abolishment was the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL position. Id.\n\n¶ 7. DC Water announced the reorganization in 2014. Id.\n\n       It came to light during the reorganization process that District of Columbia licensure\n\nrequirements for electricians required direct supervision over “employees holding only an\n\napprentice electrician’s license [by] a person holding a master electrician’s license[.]” Id. ¶ 9.\n\nDC Water sought guidance from the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and\n\nRegulatory Affairs, see id., which advised:\n\n               Pursuant to District law, “[a]n apprentice electrician shall work only\n               under the direct personal supervision and control of a licensed\n               master electrician or licensed master electrician specialist.” See\n               D.C. Official Code §47-2853.92(a) (2010 Repl.). Accordingly, an\n               apprentice electrician employed by [DC Water] must be directly\n               supervised, which means that a qualified individual must be present\n\n\nCir. 2000) (emphasis in original). The Court is satisfied that the statements set forth in Mr.\nSweeney’s declaration are capable of being converted into admissible, non-hearsay evidence if\nhe were to testify at trial. See Sabre Int’l Sec. v. Torres Advanced Enter. Sols., LLC, 72 F. Supp.\n3d 121, 129 n.9 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding that declarant’s “statements . . . are capable of being\nconverted into admissible, non-hearsay, evidence when he testifies at trial, as [plaintiff] has\nindicated that [the declarant] will do.”).\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f               to observe and guide the work of an apprentice. Further, District\n               law specifies that a master electrician or master electrician specialist\n               must provide the necessary supervision. Therefore, a licensed\n               journeyman electrician cannot supervise an apprentice. Thus, to\n               comply with District law, any Electrical Foreman or General\n               Foreman employed by [DC Water who] supervises the performance\n               of electrical work must be licensed as a master electrician or master\n               electrician specialist, as only a licensed master is legally authorized\n               to assume responsible charge over the performance of electrical\n               work in the District.\nId., Ex. 2 (Letter to Stephanie Black, Manager, Learning and Development, DC Water, from\n\nPamela Hall, Program Support Specialist, D.C. Board of Industrial Trades, Occupational and\n\nProfessional Licensing Division, Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, dated March\n\n18, 2015) at 2-3 (emphasis in original).\n\n       “DC Water did not employ a sufficient number of master electricians to directly\n\nsupervise the electricians with apprentice electrician[’s] licenses.” Id. ¶ 10. Management\n\ndetermined that, “[g]iven the financial and practical objectives of the planned reorganization, it\n\nwas not practical or reasonable for DC Water to hire additional master electricians to\n\nindividually oversee each Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL.” Id. Instead, DC Water\n\n“change[d] the minimum license qualifications for the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL\n\nposition, and create[d] the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position to replace it.” Id. ¶ 11.\n\nEach Industrial Journeyman Electrician was required to have a journeyman electrician’s license\n\nand a CDL. Id. ¶ 12; see id., Ex. 3 (Job Description, Industrial Journeyman Electrician) at 2.\n\n       American Federation of Government Employees Local 2553 (“Union”) represented\n\nemployees in the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL positions. See id. ¶ 13. 2 Pursuant to\n\n\n2\n  Mr. Sweeney’s declaration identifies the union as AFL-CIO Local 2553. Sweeney Decl. ¶¶\n13-14. The exhibits to his declaration identify the union as the American Federation of\nGovernment Employees Local 2553. See id., Ex. 8 (Memorandum of Agreement Regarding the\nDepartment of Distribution and Conveyance Systems) & Ex. 10 (Working Conditions\nAgreement Between DC Water and American Federation of Government Employees Local\n                                                  4\n\fthe collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”), DC Water notified the Union of its “decision that\n\nElectrical Equipment Repairer 11 employees needed a journeyman[] electrician[’s] license” by\n\nhand-delivering a letter to the Union’s president on July 11, 2014. Id. ¶ 14. In addition, DC\n\nWater outlined the reorganization in a PowerPoint presentation to Union representatives on that\n\nsame date. Id. ¶ 15. “[T]he Union requested effects bargaining on July 16, 2014, id. ¶ 16, and\n\nbargaining began on or about August 26, 2014, id. ¶ 18. 3 “Among the topics discussed was the\n\nrequirement that . . . Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL employees obtain a journeyman\n\nelectrician’s license to qualify for the new position” of Industrial Journeyman Electrician. Id.\n\n       The Union and DC Water disagreed about the length of time within which an Electrical\n\nEquipment Repairer 11/CDL was to obtain a journeyman electrician’s license. The Union\n\nproposed that an “employee[] holding an apprentice electrician’s license be permitted a total of\n\nfour (4) years to obtain [a] journeyman electrician’s license.” Id. ¶ 19. DC Water rejected this\n\nproposed timeframe because the journeyman electrician’s license requirement was a legal\n\nrequirement. Id. Ultimately DC Water and the Union entered into a Memorandum of\n\nAgreement (“MOA”), and with respect to the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 positions, the\n\nparties agreed:\n\n                  Current DC Water bargaining unit employees[] in the position of\n                  Electrical Equipment Repairer possessing a DC Apprentice\n                  Electrician[’s] license selected for Industrial Journeyman\n                  Electrician and Industrial Specialist Electrician positions shall have\n                  until March 31, 2015 to acquire the required DC Journeyman\n                  Electrician[’s] license.    Beginning September 2, 2014, any\n\n\n2553). The Court presumes that the correct union is American Federation of Government\nEmployees Local 2553.\n3\n  In the interim, the Union requested “additional information about the potential effects of the\nreorganization on the Union’s members,” and DC Water responded in writing. Sweeney Decl. ¶\n17; see id., Ex. 6 (Letter to Mustaafa Dozier, Manager, Labor Relations and Compliance, DC\nWater, from Barbara B. Hutchinson dated July 16, 2014) and Ex. 7 (Letter to Barbara B.\nHutchinson from Clifford Mustaafa Dozier, Esq., dated July 18, 2014).\n                                                    5\n\f                  bargaining unit member in possession of a DC Apprentice license\n                  may participate in training for and testing for the DC Journeyman\n                  Electrician[’s] license. DC Water shall pay for this training.\n                  Employees are expected to test within thirty (30) calendar days of\n                  completing this training. Employees that fail the test may retest so\n                  long as the second test is taken by March 31, 2015.\nId., Ex. 8 (Memorandum of Agreement Regarding the Department of Distribution and\n\nConveyance Systems dated September 2, 2014) ¶ 4.\n\n        The MOA also included agreements with respect to other DC Water employees affected\n\nby the reorganization. For example:\n\n                  For any AFGE Local 2553 bargaining unit employee in the position\n                  of Utility Systems Operator RW-08, hired into the position of a\n                  Utility Systems Operator I or II, the employee shall have 18 months\n                  to obtain the required certification. Any training shall be paid for\n                  by DC Water. If any employee fails a test at any point during the\n                  eighteen (18) month period [he] shall be allowed to retest at DC\n                  Water’s expense, so long as the retest occurs prior to the conclusion\n                  of the eighteen (18) month period . . . . Provided the employee has\n                  obtained the certification in [his] area of prior work experience\n                  (Distribution or Collections), employees who do not meet a\n                  certification requirement because the testing authority determines\n                  the employee did not perform the requisite number of years of work\n                  in the classification, shall be provided the time needed to meet the\n                  classification requirement.\nId., Ex. 8 ¶ 3.\n\n        Notwithstanding the MOA, in October 2014, “the Union initiated an unfair labor practice\n\ngrievance under the procedures laid out in Article 58 of the [CBA].” Id. ¶ 23; see generally id.,\n\nEx. 10 (Working Conditions Agreement Between DC Water and American Federation of\n\nGovernment Employees Local 2553) at 81-87 (Art. 58, General Grievance and Arbitration\n\nProcedures). The grievance did not delay implementation of the reorganization in November\n\n2014. Id. ¶ 24.\n\n        “In the fall of 2014, [plaintiff] was informed that his job title was being changed to\n\nIndustrial Journeyman Electrician and that [an] Industrial Journeymen Electrician[ was] required\n\n                                                   6\n\fto obtain a [j]ourneyman [e]lectrican[’s l]icense.” Am. Compl. ¶ 7. On October 3, 2014, DC\n\nWater proffered a copy of the job description for the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position,\n\nSweeney Decl. ¶ 25, and plaintiff refused to sign a form acknowledging its receipt, see id., Ex. 9\n\n(Job Description Transmittal). Plaintiff had only six months to obtain a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense, even though “[t]he license generally requires years of coursework and the signature of a\n\nmaster electrician who supervised the candidate.” Am. Compl. ¶ 8.\n\n       Pursuant to the MOA, DC Water provided training for employees converting to the new\n\nIndustrial Journeyman Electrician positions. Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 26-27. Plaintiff began the course\n\nin September 2014. Id. ¶ 26. According to DC Water, plaintiff took a 15-week course ending in\n\nDecember, 2014. Id. ¶ 28. According to plaintiff, DC Water provided a six-week course at the\n\nend of which he “received a certificate showing that he completed sixty hours of training for the\n\nJourneyman Electrician Examination.” Am. Compl. ¶ 8. However, he “did not believe the\n\ncourse sufficiently prepared him for the examination,” in part because “the course instructor\n\nadmitted that [the] course was designed as a refresher for people who had already passed the test\n\npreviously, and it was not meant for first-time test takers.” Id.\n\n       “In the fall of 2014, [plaintiff] told various members of human resources . . . that he is\n\ndyslexic and needed additional time and to go to class if DC Water wanted him to obtain a\n\n[journeyman electrician’s] license.” Id. ¶ 9. “They refused to give him the additional time,” id.,\n\neven though “other DC Water electricians, including Caucasian and younger electricians,” were\n\ngiven 18 months to two years to obtain their licenses, and “some were even allowed to go back\n\nto school, id. ¶ 10. For example, according to plaintiff, there were employees “in the machine\n\nshop division [who] were not subject to the new [j]ourneyman [e]lectrician[’s] license\n\nrequirement[.]” Id. Plaintiff “tried to obtain a doctor’s medical certification to show that he is\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fdyslexic,” but he was not able to do so until May 13, 2015. Id. ¶ 11; see generally Mem. of P. &\n\nA. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 21 (“Pl.’s Opp’n”) Ex. E (Clinical\n\nNeuropsychological Evaluation dated May 13, 2015). 4\n\n       Meanwhile, the Union’s grievance proceeded. “The parties could not agree on a\n\nstatement of issues to be decided by the Arbitrator.” Def.’s Mem., Ex. 14 (Arbitration Decision\n\ndated July 12, 2015) at 2. On “[c]onsider[ation of] the evidence presented and the arguments in\n\nthe briefs,” id., Ex. 14 at 20, the Arbitrator fashioned his own statement of four issues to be\n\ndecided, two of which are relevant here:\n\n               Did [DC Water] violate the MOA or Articles 4 or 18 of the [CBA]\n               when it required Electrical Equipment Repairer . . . 11s to convert\n               to the job classifications of Industrial Journeyman Electrician or\n               Industrial Specialist Electrician and to obtain a CDL and\n               journeyman electrician[’s] license?\n\n               Did [DC Water] violate Article 34, Section A of the [CBA] when\n               the MOA required Industrial Journeyman Electricians and Industrial\n               Specialist Electricians to obtain new licenses by March [31], 2015?\nId., Ex. 14 at 21. 5 The Arbitrator found that DC Water did not violate any of the relevant CBA\n\nor MOA provisions, and denied the grievance. Id., Ex. 14 at 40. The Arbitrator’s decision in DC\n\nWater’s favor was binding on both parties. Id., Ex. 10 at 86 (Art. 58, Sec. 1, para. 12).\n\n\n4\n   Plaintiff claims to have told human resources personnel that he has dyslexia, yet he fails to\nidentify the person(s) he notified, indicate whether or to whom he delivered the medical\ncertification, or identify the person(s) to whom he directed his request(s) for accommodation.\nPlaintiff points to no materials in the record to show that DC Water actually knew he has\ndyslexia, and he cannot establish this fact on summary judgment by relying on the allegations of\nhis Amended Complaint. See Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to\nDef.’s Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 20-22, 24 (citing Am. Compl. ¶ 17). He has cited no evidence in the\nrecord to support this claim. In addition, there is no evidence in the record that the Dr.\nOlarinde’s report with the diagnosis of dyslexia ever was provided to DC Water.\n5\n  In relevant part, Article 4 provides that DC Water “shall give the President of the Union\nadvance written notice of changes in personnel policies, practices, or working conditions\naffecting employees covered by this Agreement.” Sweeney Decl., Ex. 10 at 2 (Art. 4, Sec. B,\npara. 2). Article 18 pertains to the release of information. See id., Ex. 10 (Table of Contents).\n                                                  8\n\f       There were seven incumbent Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL employees eligible\n\nfor the newly-created Industrial Journey Electrician positions: six are African-American and one\n\nis Caucasian. Sweeney Decl. ¶ 29. Two of the African-American employees already had\n\njourneyman electrician’s licenses. Id. One African-American employee and the Caucasian\n\nemployee “successfully tested for, and obtained, a journeyman electrician’s license.” Id.\n\nPlaintiff and the two remaining African-American employees did not obtain a journeyman\n\nelectrician’s license by the March 31, 2015 deadline. Id. ¶ 30. In April 2015, plaintiff\n\n“submitted his application for the Journeyman Electrician license exam, and was authorized to\n\ntake the exam on June 1, 2015.” Am. Compl. ¶ 12.\n\n       On April 1, 2015, Charles Sweeney, Director of Distribution and Conveyance Systems,\n\nSweeney Decl. ¶ 3, sent plaintiff a letter “informing him of his failure to meet the licensure\n\nrequirement to convert to the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position” by the March 31, 2015\n\ndeadline, id. ¶ 30; see id., Ex. 12 (Letter to plaintiff from Charles Sweeney dated April 1, 2015).\n\nDC Water declined to terminate plaintiff’s employment at that time. Id. ¶ 31. Instead, “DC\n\nWater removed him from his position as an electrician on April 1, 2015,” Am. Compl. ¶ 12, and\n\nallowed him (and the two other African-American employees who failed to meet the March 31,\n\n2015 deadline) an additional 60 days, to May 31, 2015, to obtain a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense, Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 31-32; see id., Ex. 12 (Acknowledgment of Receipt of Sixty (60) day\n\nNotice to Obtain a Journeyman Electrician[’s] License). Plaintiff and two other African-\n\nAmericans “were the only Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 employees provided additional time\n\n\n\n\nArticle 34 pertains to employee licenses and certifications. If DC Water finds that “employees\nholding certain positions should be certified or licensed, [it] agrees to assure that all employees\nwho are employed in such positions . . . shall be trained and otherwise assisted in satisfying this\nrequirement.” Id., Ex. 10 at 42 (Art. 34, Sec. A).\n                                                 9\n\fto obtain the required license.” Id. ¶ 32. Still, plaintiff failed to obtain the license, and DC\n\nWater terminated his employment effective May 31, 2015. Id. ¶ 34; see id., Ex. 13 (Personnel\n\nAction Report). He “received no benefits as part of the reduction-in-force (RIF) or severance\n\npackage from the termination,” and he was not eligible for rehire, see Sweeney Decl., Ex. 13, as\n\nwere other DC Water employees, Am. Compl. ¶ 12.\n\n       “On May 26, 2015, [plaintiff] went to the Washington Field Office of the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission [EEOC],” where he filed a charge of discrimination,\n\ncompleted an intake report, and signed an agreement to mediate his discrimination charges. Id. ¶\n\n13. To indicate the basis of discrimination, plaintiff only checked the box marked\n\n“DISABILITY.” See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. A (Charge of Discrimination dated May 26, 2015). He\n\nstated that the alleged discrimination took place between April 1, 2015 and May 26, 2015, and\n\ninvolved “CONTINUING ACTION.” Id., Ex. A. The narrative section of the charge read:\n\n               I work as an Electrical Equipment Repair[er] 11/CDL for the DC\n               Water and Sewer Authority . . . . I have a disability and require\n               reasonable accommodations.        I have documentation that\n               demonstrates that I am disabled and require reasonable\n               accommodations.\n\n               I require a reasonable accommodation so that I can obtain the\n               training for the . . . the Journeyman Electrician[’s] License. My\n               Employer has not provided me with reasonable accommodations for\n               the training required to obtain th[is] license[]. Because I have been\n               unable to obtain th[is] license[] I have been laid off.\n\n               I believe that my layoff (and possible subsequent termination as a\n               result of being unable to obtain these licenses) was discriminatory\n               in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as\n               amended[] (“ADA”)[,] and that my Employer has failed to provide[]\n               me with a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA.\nId., Ex. A.\n\n       The EEOC “issued a Notice of Right to Sue on May 27, 2015.” Am. Compl. ¶ 13. It\n\nadvised plaintiff that, if he chose to file a lawsuit, the must do so within 90 days of his receipt of\n\n                                                  10\n\fthe notice. See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. H (Dismissal and Notice of Rights dated May 27, 2015).\n\nProceeding pro se, plaintiff filed his original complaint, ECF No. 1, on September 29, 2016. 6 He\n\nsubsequently retained counsel who filed an amended complaint, ECF No. 17, on his behalf.\n\n\n                                           II. DISCUSSION\n\n                                  A. Summary Judgment Standard\n\n        DC Water moves for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Fed. R .Civ. P. 56(a). A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must\n\nsupport the assertion by “citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including\n\ndepositions, documents . . . affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . . , admissions, [or]\n\ninterrogatory answers[, or by] showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or\n\npresence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\n\nsupport the fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). “If a party fails to properly support an assertion of\n\nfact or fails to properly address another party’s assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the\n\ncourt may . . . consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n        When considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court cannot make credibility\n\ndeterminations or weigh the evidence; the evidence must be analyzed in the light most favorable\n\n\n\n\n6\n   It is the practice of the Clerk of Court to date stamp each pleading upon receipt. Review of the\ndocket reveals that the Clerk of Court received plaintiff’s original complaint, ECF No. 1, and his\napplication to proceed in forma pauperis, ECF No. 2, on September 29, 2016, that the Court\ngranted plaintiff’s application on October 14, 2016, and that the Clerk of Court officially filed\nboth documents on CM/ECF on October 20, 2016. The Court treats the original complaint as if\nit had been filed on September 29, 2016.\n                                                   11\n\fto the nonmoving party, with all justifiable inferences drawn in his favor. Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). “If material facts are at issue, or, though undisputed, are\n\nsusceptible to divergent inferences, summary judgment is not available.” Moore v. Hartman,\n\n571 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The mere existence of a factual dispute does\n\nnot bar summary judgment, however. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. “Only disputes over\n\nfacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the\n\nentry of summary judgment.” Id. The adverse party must “do more than simply show that there\n\nis some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio\n\nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986), and he cannot rely on conclusory assertions without any factual\n\nbasis in the record to create a genuine dispute, see Ass’n of Flight Attendants - CWA v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Transp., 564 F.3d 462, 465-66 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\n                                     B. ADA Claim (Count I)\n\n       DC Water moves for summary judgment on Count I of the Amended Complaint on the\n\nground that plaintiff’s ADA claim is time-barred. Def.’s Mem. at 7. The Notice of Right to Sue\n\nincludes a warning that any lawsuit was to be filed within 90 days of the claimant’s receipt of the\n\nnotice. See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. H. DC Water contends that plaintiff filed his lawsuit “nearly\n\nseventeen (17) months after he received his Notice of Right to Sue, and approximately fourteen\n\n(14) months after the expiration of [his] deadline to initiate his ADA suit.” Def.’s Mem. at 8\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       The Amended Complaint does not specify the date on which plaintiff received the Notice\n\nof Right to Sue. However, he does not deny DC Water’s assertions that he received the notice on\n\nMay 27, 2015, that he had until August 25, 2015 to file a lawsuit under the ADA, and that he\n\nfiled his original complaint on September 29, 2016. See Def.’s Statement of Undisputed Facts in\n\n                                                12\n\fSupport of its Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 18-2 (“Def.’s SOF”) ¶¶ 28, 30-31; Statement of\n\nDisputed Material Facts in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 21-1\n\n(“Pl.’s SOF”) at 3 (page number designated by ECF) (omitting mention of Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 24-32).\n\nHe argues instead that the limitations period should be tolled. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 12-13. Plaintiff\n\nhas dyslexia, a learning disability, which he claims rendered him non compos mentis and thus\n\nincapable of handling his affairs between May 30, 2015 and September 29, 2016. Id. at 12; see\n\nPl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Mot. for Summ. J., or in the\n\nAlternative, Mot. for a More Definite Statement, ECF No. 12, at 6-7. For this reason, plaintiff\n\nasserts, his lawsuit should be considered timely filed.\n\n       Under District of Columbia law, “when a person entitled to maintain an action is, at the\n\ntime the right of action accrues . . . non compos mentis . . . he or his proper representative may\n\nbring action within the time limited after the disability is removed.” D.C. Code § 12-302(a).\n\nAlthough the statute itself “does not itself define non compos mentis,” Smith-Haynie v. District\n\nof Columbia, 155 F.3d 575, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1998), “[t]he phrase . . . generally refers to someone\n\nincapable of handling his own affairs or unable to function [in] society,” Hendel v. World Plan\n\nExec. Council, 705 A.2d 656, 665 (D.C. 1997) (quoting Speiser v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 670 F. Supp. 380, 384 (D.D.C. 1986), aff’d , 818 F.2d 95 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n\n       “The disability of a person claiming to be non compos mentis must be ‘of such a nature as\n\nto show [he] is unable to manage [his] business affairs or estate, or to comprehend [his] legal\n\nrights or liabilities.’” Smith-Haynie, 155 F.3d at 580 (quoting Decker v. Fink, 422 A.2d 389, 392\n\n(Md. 1980)); see also Oparaugo v. Watts, 884 A.2d 63, 73 (D.C. 2005). Impaired judgment by\n\nitself does not excuse a plaintiff’s untimely filing, see Decker, 422 A.2d at 393, and “[t]he mere\n\nexistence of mental problems or life difficulties will not suffice,” Davis v. Vilsack, 880 F. Supp.\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f2d 156, 162 (D.D.C. 2012). Indicia of non compos mentis status might include a showing that\n\nplaintiff has been “adjudged incompetent, signed a power of attorney, had a guardian or\n\ncaretaker appointed, or otherwise took measures to let someone else handle [his] affairs[.]”\n\nSpeiser, 670 F. Supp. at 385.\n\n        Plaintiff relied on the reports of Emmanuel A. Olarinde, Ph.D., a licensed clinical\n\npsychologist, one of which was prepared prior to his termination. Plaintiff had “referred himself\n\nfor a psychoeducational evaluation . . . designed to assess [his] cognitive ability [and] academic\n\nachievement in reading and mathematics.” Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. E-1 (Clinical Neuropsychological\n\nEvaluation dated May 13, 2015) at 1. 7 Dr. Olarinde observed:\n\n                [Plaintiff] came to the testing sessions [on April 13, April 20, and\n                April 27, 2015] well kept, and groomed. Hygiene was effectively\n                managed and he dressed appropriately for the occasion . . . . Facial\n                expression was responsive, and eye contact was appropriate.\n                [Plaintiff] demonstrated normal activity level and he appeared not\n                to be easily aroused by extraneous environmental stimuli . . . .\n\n                [Plaintiff’s] speech was spontaneous but with significant\n                articulation problems.      However[,] communication with the\n                examiner was not impeded in any significant way either receptively\n                or expressively. His thinking was assessed through his speech\n                production. [Plaintiff’s] though process was coherent, logical and\n                goal directed. He was able to reach his goal of thoughts without\n                significant digression. Thought content was devoid of delusion,\n                phobia, obsession, suicide, homicide, preoccupied ideas, or any\n                symptoms of psychosis . . . .\n\n                Major components of his memory, such as, immediate, short-term\n                and remote memories[,] appeared to be intact. [Plaintiff] did not\n                exhibit significant attention and concentration problems. [He] was\n                adequately oriented to time, place and person . . . . He complied\n                with the examiner’s guidelines and performed all the tasks and\n                answered all the questions presented to him.\n\nId., Ex. E-1 at 1-2.\n\n\n7\n  Plaintiff produces two evaluations, one dated May 13, 2015 and the other dated September 13,\n2015. The Court designates the former “Ex. E-1” and the latter “Ex. E-2.”\n                                                14\n\f       Subsequent testing with respect to plaintiff’s intellectual ability revealed that plaintiff’s\n\n“reasoning abilities on verbal tasks are generally in the low average range . . . while his\n\nnonverbal reasoning abilities are significantly higher and in the average range.” Id., Ex. E-2\n\n(Clinical Neuropsychological Evaluation dated September 13, 2015) at 4. Further, Dr. Olarinde\n\nfound that plaintiff’s “ability to sustain attention, concentrate, and exert mental control is in the\n\nlow average range,” and his “ability in processing simple or routine visual material without\n\nmaking errors is in the average range.” Id., Ex. E-2 at 4.\n\n       Dr. Olarinde concluded that plaintiff would “have serious difficulties in learning and\n\nmemory in any training that involves reading and writing.” Id., Ex. E-1 at 4. With respect to\n\nplaintiff’s reading ability, Dr. Olarinde found “[a] relative weakness in decoding words as\n\ncompared to reading words in isolation,” which “may indicate that [plaintiff] has difficulty\n\napplying phonetic rules for decoding words but may not have learned vocabulary words to\n\nautomaticity.” Id., Ex. E-1 at 2-3. He concluded that plaintiff “has a disorder of the basic\n\npsychological process involved in understanding or in using written language that manifest[s]\n\nitself in an imperfect ability to read[,] write and spell, or to do mathematical calculations,\n\nincluding conditions such as visual and auditory perceptual disabilities and dyslexia.” Id., Ex. E-\n\n1 at 4 (emphasis removed). Only after this second round of testing did Dr. Olarinde appear to\n\ndiagnose a “[r]eading [d]isorder with impairment in word reading and reading comprehension\n\n(dyslexia),” recommending that plaintiff’s employer “accommodate for his reading disabilities”\n\nby using “a device where instructions or test items or questions are read to him.” Id., Ex. E-2 at\n\n6.\n\n       In addition, plaintiff pointed to errors he made as evidence of his inability to comprehend\n\nhis legal rights. When he “attempted to complete the EEOC Charge of Discrimination form . . .\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fhe selected the box that stated he does not have a disability and selected ‘genetic information’ as\n\nthe type of discrimination he faced on the EEO questionnaire.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 12; see id. Exs. A,\n\nF. He also “stated that he faced a ‘layoff’ on April 1, 2015, because he did not understand DC\n\nWater’s letter [to mean] that he needed to complete his license within sixty days.” Id.; see id.,\n\nEx. C. Further, he pointed to his misidentification of his former employer on his pro se\n\ncomplaint as “DC Water Is Life,” and he even wrote down the incorrect zip code for his home\n\naddress. Id. And among other examples, plaintiff referred to the quality of his pro se complaint\n\nand DC Water’s need to file a “motion for a more definite statement due to the limited facts\n\npresented and nonexistent legal allegation” as proof that he “was absolutely unable to manage his\n\nown legal affairs.” Id. at 13.\n\n       Missing from plaintiff’s opposition are any references to materials in the record of this\n\ncase tending to show that plaintiff could not manage his own affairs or otherwise function in\n\nsociety because of a reading disorder. Nothing is known about plaintiff’s activities and mental or\n\nphysical condition during this supposed period of incapacity. Plaintiff does not claim that his\n\njudgment was impaired or that his physical or mental health was compromised. He neither\n\nidentifies an event that suddenly triggered his incapacity on May 30, 2015, nor explains how his\n\nincapacity was removed on September 29, 2016, the day he filed his original pro se complaint.\n\n       Rather, plaintiff’s actions immediately prior to the purported onset of his non compus\n\nmentis status on May 30, 2015 reflect an understanding that his employment with DC Water was\n\nat risk unless he could obtain a journeyman electrician’s license, that his dyslexia is a basis for\n\nrequesting a reasonable accommodation to prepare for the licensure examination, that DC Water\n\nmay have discriminated against him because of his disability, and that the EEOC was an\n\nappropriate place to seek relief. Dr. Olarinde’s observations, particularly his assessment that\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fplaintiff’s “thought process was coherent, logical and goal directed,” Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. E-1 at 1,\n\nare not consistent with a person who purports to be incompetent or who was otherwise unable to\n\nmanage his own affairs. Furthermore, the narrative set forth in plaintiff’s EEOC charge was\n\ncoherent and clearly set forth a claim of discrimination based on disability.\n\n       The Court concludes that plaintiff was not non compos mentis, that equitable tolling of\n\nthe 90-day limitations period is not warranted, and that his ADA claim is untimely. Summary\n\njudgment will be granted in DC Water’s favor on Count I.\n\n                       C. Title VII (Count II) and ADEA (Count IV) Claims\n\n       An employer shall not “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise\n\nto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s race [.]” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Nor\n\nshall an employer “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of [his] age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).\n\n       A plaintiff bringing employment discrimination claims under Title VII and the ADEA\n\nfirst must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b) (Title VII);\n\n29 U.S.C. § 626(d) (ADEA). If the EEOC determines “that there is no reasonable cause to\n\nbelieve that the charge is true,” the EEOC “shall dismiss the charge and promptly notify the\n\nperson claiming to be aggrieved.” Id. Only after a plaintiff files his charge of discrimination and\n\nobtains a notice of right to sue has he exhausted his administrative remedies on a race\n\ndiscrimination claim, see, e.g., Bell v. Redding, 539 F. Supp. 2d 423, 424 (D.D.C. 2008), and\n\nonly then can he file a lawsuit in federal district court, see, e.g., Jones v. District of Columbia,\n\n273 F. Supp. 2d 61, 64 (D.D.C. 2003). A plaintiff who is not a federal employee raising an age\n\n                                                  17\n\fdiscrimination claim must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, but he need not obtain\n\na notice of right to sue before filing his lawsuit. See Cruz-Packer v. District of Columbia, 539 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 181, 189 (D.D.C. 2008). “These procedural requirements . . . are not trivial.” Rattigan\n\nv. Gonzales, 503 F. Supp. 2d 56, 68 (D.D.C. 2007). They are designed to give “agencies an\n\nopportunity to handle matters internally whenever possible and to ensure that the federal courts\n\nare burdened only when reasonably necessary.” Id. (citing Brown v. Marsh, 777 F.2d 8, 14 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Generally, the scope of the subsequent lawsuit “is limited . . . to claims that are ‘like or\n\nreasonably related to the allegations of the charge and growing out of such allegations.’” Park v.\n\nHoward Univ., 71 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing Cheek v. Western and Southern Life\n\nIns. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994)); see Payne v. Salazar, 619 F.3d 56, 65 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010) (reinforcing Park holding insofar as claims in civil suit must arise from the administrative\n\ninvestigation that can reasonably be expected to follow the charge of discrimination). “A\n\nplaintiff fails to exhaust [his] administrative remedies when the complaint [he] files in federal\n\ncourt includes a claim that was not raised in the administrative complaint.” Mogenhan v.\n\nShinseki, 630 F. Supp. 2d 56, 60 (D.D.C. 2009).\n\n       DC Water seeks judgment in its favor on Counts II and IV of the Amended Complaint on\n\nthe ground that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his race and\n\nage discrimination claims before filing this lawsuit. See Def.’s Mem. at 8-10. It notes that\n\nplaintiff’s charge of discrimination “contains neither a checked box for ‘race’ or ‘age,’ nor does\n\nthe factual narrative include any reference to discrimination based on age or race, or to\n\n[plaintiff’s] age or race.” Id. at 9. Rather, “the checked boxes and factual narrative only include\n\nallegations of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate,” such that “no reasonable\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\freading and/or interpretation of the Charge . . . allows the inference that [plaintiff] intended to\n\nbring claims of race and age discrimination, or even contemplated the existence of any such\n\nclaims at the time of filing the Charge.” Id. at 9-10.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that his failure to check the boxes for race and age discrimination is not\n\ndispositive. Rather, he contends that his race and age discrimination claims “would have arisen\n\nfrom an investigation of his charge of discrimination” based on his disability because all of his\n\nclaims “arose from the same factual circumstances.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 10. And, he asserts, his\n\nIntake Questionnaire indicates his intention to list the ages of certain employees whom DC\n\nWater treated more favorably than it treated plaintiff, see id., Ex. F (Intake Questionnaire) at 2,\n\nfrom which the EEOC was to divine an age discrimination claim. Similarly, he asserts that an\n\ninvestigation as to “timing concerns regarding the Journeyman license would give rise to [his]\n\nclaims of race and age discrimination.” Id. at 11. The Court is not persuaded.\n\n       A Title VII claim “must arise from the administrative investigation that can reasonably be\n\nexpected to follow the charge of discrimination.” Park, 71 F.3d at 907 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted). It simply is not reasonable to conclude that an investigation of the\n\nallegations in plaintiff’s EEOC charge, particularly in light of its repeated mention of “disability”\n\nand “reasonable accommodation,” would uncover a claim of discrimination based on race or age.\n\nSee Hicklin v. McDonald, 110 F. Supp. 3d 16, 21 (D.D.C. 2015) (finding that plaintiff “failed to\n\ngive any notice that he was alleging retaliation in his EEO complaint; rather, he clearly indicated\n\nrace and religion as the only bases for the adverse action he suffered and furnished a narrative\n\nfocusing solely on his allegedly hostile work environment without mentioning retaliation or\n\nreprisal”); Massey v.

It is apparent, however, that plaintiff’s “timing concerns” pertain to the time period\n\nwithin which he was expected to train for, take and pass the journeyman electrician’s license\n\nexamination, and the difficulty his reading disability may have posed. An EEOC investigation\n\nlikely would have focused on the nature of plaintiff’s purported disability and the reasonable\n\naccommodations he may have requested or to which he may have been entitled. It is not at all\n\nclear that inquiries of this nature would have uncovered a basis for race and age discrimination\n\nclaims plaintiff himself had not raised.\n\n       The Court concludes that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with\n\nrespect to his Title VII and ADEA claims, and grants summary judgment for DC Water on\n\nCounts II and IV.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f                                 D.

It instead involves a\n\ndecisionmaker’s undertaking a course of action ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\n\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Ashcroft v.

In other words, “only . . . purposeful discrimination” violates Section\n\n1981. Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391 (1982).\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that DC Water discriminated against him on the basis of his race in\n\nviolation of Section 1981when it “changed his official position to require an unnecessary license,\n\ngave him six months to obtain the [j]ourneyman [e]lectrician[’s l]icense while giving Caucasian\n\nelectricians eighteen months to two years to obtain their . . . [l]icenses, denied [him] the chance\n\nto go back to school while offering Caucasian employees the opportunity to take classes and\n\nobtain the education necessary to earn their [j]ourneyman [e]lectrician[’s l]icenses, removed him\n\nfrom his position, and terminated him from his employment.” Am. Compl. ¶ 25.\n\n       “For purposes of summary judgment, the operative question under Section 1981 . . . is\n\nwhether the employee produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that . . . the\n\nemployer intentionally discriminated against [him] on the basis of race.” Ayissi-Etoh, 712 F.3d\n\nat 576 (quoting Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008)\n\n(internal quotation marks removed). Where a plaintiff presents no direct evidence of\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fdiscrimination, the Court employs the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973):\n\n               Under this formula, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case\n               of prohibited discrimination. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.,\n               Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000). The employer must then come\n               forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the\n               challenged employment decision. Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\n               Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1981). If the employer meets this\n               burden, the framework falls away and the court must decide one\n               ultimate question: “Has the employee produced sufficient evidence\n               for a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted non-\n               discriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the\n               employer intentionally discriminated against the employee[?]”\n               Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir.\n               2008).\nDeJesus v. WP Co. LLC, 841 F.3d 527, 532-33 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\n\n       However, it is well-established that “it is no longer relevant” if plaintiff established his\n\nprima facie case once defendant has proffered a non-discriminatory explanation for its conduct.\n\nU.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983). Here, because DC\n\nWater has proffered an allegedly non-discriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff,\n\nsetting forth facts to establish a prima facie case would be “an unnecessary sideshow.” Brady,\n\n520 F.3d at 494. Thus, the Court need only determine whether plaintiff has “produced sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable jury to find the [defendant’s] non-discriminatory reason was not the\n\nactual reason that [DC Water] intentionally discriminated against [plaintiff] on the basis of” his\n\nprotected status. Id.\n\n       DC Water proffered that compliance with District of Columbia law prompted its actions.\n\nSee Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 8-11; see id., Ex. 2; Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 8-9. It “could not ignore that some of\n\nthe Electrical Equipment Repairer 11s, including [plaintiff] might not be qualified electricians in\n\nthe District of Columbia because they had apprentice electrician’s licenses, worked\n\nindependently for extended periods of time, and [did] not [work] under the direct supervision of\n\n                                                 22\n\fa master electrician.” Def.’s Mem. at 12. Because there were not enough master electricians in\n\nDC Water’s employ to supervise directly each Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 with only an\n\napprentice electrician’s license, and because DC Water lacked the resources to hire a sufficient\n\nnumber of master electricians, it opted to “chang[] the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 position\n\ninto the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position.” Id. at 12-13. Each Electrical Equipment\n\nRepairer 11 – regardless of his race – was required to have, or to obtain by March 31, 2015, a\n\njourneyman electrician’s license. Id. at 13; see Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 20-21; Def.’s SOF ¶ 17. All of\n\nthe then-incumbent Electrical Equipment Repairer 11s had the same deadline, and all had the\n\nsame opportunity for training at DC Water’s expense in preparation for the license examination.\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 13-14; see Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 21-22; Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 18, 21. Plaintiff was allowed\n\ntwo additional months to comply with the licensure requirement, and still failed to do so.\n\nSweeney Decl. ¶ 13; Def.’s SOF ¶¶ 25, 29. DC Water proffered that the imposition of a\n\nlicensure requirement consistent with District of Columbia law was the legitimate\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for abolishing the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 positions, creating\n\nthe new Industrial Journeyman Electrician positions, and requiring each Journeyman Electrician\n\nto have a journeyman electrician’s license. Def.’s Mem. at 12.\n\n       At this stage, plaintiff bears the burden to show that DC Water’s proffered reason was not\n\nthe actual reason for its employment decisions, and, instead, DC Water discriminated against\n\nplaintiff on the basis of his race. See Teneyck v. Omni Shoreham Hotel, 365 F.3d 1139, 1151\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003). “One way to discredit an employer’s justification is to show that similarly\n\nsituated employees of a different race received more favorable treatment.” Royall v. Nat’l Ass’n\n\nof Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 548 F.3d 137, 145 (D.C.

Feb.\n\n21, 2017).\n\n        The Amended Complaint alleges that Caucasian electricians received more favorable\n\ntreatment than plaintiff, an African American, because they were allowed 18 months to two years\n\nto obtain their journeyman electrician’s licenses. Am. Compl. ¶ 25. Nevertheless, he faults DC\n\nWater for proceeding as if “the only employees similarly-situated to [plaintiff] are Electrical\n\nEquipment Repairer 11 employees.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 2; see id. at 7. Plaintiff contends that the\n\n“job title is not dispositive to the identification of similarly-situated employees.” Id. at 2.\n\nAccording to plaintiff, there are other similarly-situated employees who “received more time to\n\nobtain their licenses and were . . . allowed to return to school,” id., but these employees in “other\n\nunits,” id. at 3, cannot be identified without discovery, see id. at 2, 8.\n\n        Notwithstanding his argument for discovery, plaintiff refers to the MOA, see id. at 3,\n\nparticularly its third paragraph regarding “Utility Systems Operator RW-08 [employees] hired\n\ninto the position of a Utility Systems Operator I or II,” who were allowed 18 months to obtain\n\nnecessary certification for that position, id., Ex. B (MOA) ¶ 3. Plaintiff fails, however, to\n\ndescribe a Utility Systems Operator’s job duties or set forth any basis from which the Court\n\nmight determine whether and to what extent Utility Systems Operators’ situation mirrored\n\nplaintiff’s situation. Further, plaintiff offers no response to DC Water’s assertions that “[t]hese\n\nemployees are not electricians,” Def.’s Reply Mem. of P. & A in Support of its Mot. for Summ.\n\nJ., ECF No. 23 (“Def.’s Reply”) at 20; see id., Decl. of Roger E. Brown, Jr., Ex. B (Job\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fDescription, Utility Systems Operator 08), and that “their job duties and supervisory structures\n\ndiffer from either the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 or Industrial Journeyman Electrician\n\npositions,” id. at 20.\n\n        The Court may allow a nonmovant time to take discovery if he “shows by affidavit or\n\ndeclaration that, for specified reasons, [he] cannot present facts essential to justify [his]\n\nposition.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). The declaration must “outline the particular facts he intends to\n\ndiscover and describe why those facts are necessary to the litigation,” explain why he could not\n\nproduce these facts in his opposition to the summary judgment motion, and demonstrate that the\n\ninformation he seeks is actually discoverable. Convertino v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 684 F.3d 93,\n\n99-100 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). The declaration of plaintiff’s counsel is deficient.\n\nFor example, counsel requests information about the reorganization generally, and about\n\nelectricians specifically. See Decl. Pursuant to Rule 56(d) of the Fed. R. Civ. P. in Support of\n\nPl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 21-2 ¶¶ 1-5. Missing from his declaration is\n\nan outline of the particular facts he intends to discover and why these yet-to-be discovered facts\n\nare necessary. If Utility Systems Operators are the similarly-situated employees plaintiff deems\n\ncomparators, these employees are not even mentioned in the list of matters about which plaintiff\n\nclaims discovery is needed. 8\n\n        Utility Systems Operators are not electricians, and nothing in the record of this case\n\ndemonstrates that these non-electricians are viable comparators. Furthermore, in the context of\n\n\n\n8\n  Nor does counsel explain why he could not produce items such as plaintiff’s medical records,\ndocuments relating to plaintiff’s ability to manage his own affairs, and requests for\naccommodations for plaintiff’s alleged disability. See Decl. Pursuant to Rule 56(d) of the Fed.\nR. Civ. P. in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 7-9. These matters are\ndiscoverable (even if DC Water is unlikely to have information such as plaintiff’s medical\nrecords, for example), within the realm of plaintiff’s personal knowledge, or otherwise accessible\nto plaintiff absent formal discovery.\n                                                  25\n\fthis case, plaintiff does not demonstrate that African American electricians were disadvantaged\n\nin any way. There is but one Caucasian electrician in plaintiff’s situation -- he was offered the\n\nsame training opportunity plaintiff was offered, and he obtained a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense by the March 31, 2015 deadline. Arguably, DC Water treated plaintiff and two fellow\n\nAfrican American electricians more favorably by allowing them two additional months, to May\n\n31, 2015, to obtain the required journeyman electrician’s license.\n\n       Next, plaintiff argues that DC Water changed his position description because there had\n\nbeen a change in District of Columbia law. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 5-6. “The clause governing the\n\nlimitation of those who hold an apprentice [electrician’s] license ha[s] not changed since at least\n\n1981.” Id. at 6. Thus, for his entire tenure at DC Water, plaintiff “worked under the supervision\n\nof an Electrical Foreman, not a Master Electrician,” such that DC Water had “been breaking\n\nD.C. statutory law” for decades. Id. According to plaintiff, these circumstances “suggest[] that\n\n[DC Water’s] purported justification for the change of [plaintiff’s] position is false and pretext\n\nfor unlawful discrimination.” Id.\n\n       DC Water does not argue that there had been a change in law regarding electrician’s\n\nlicenses. Rather, it explains, in order “[t]o come into compliance with applicable regulations\n\nalready on the books, DC Water abolished the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 position” and\n\ncreated the Industrial Journeyman Electrician in its place. Def.’s Reply at 16 (emphasis in\n\noriginal); see Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 8-12. An “Industrial Journeyman Electrician . . . would perform\n\nsimilar duties, but had a job description which explicitly required a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense. Def.’s Reply at 16. “The tasks and duties [plaintiff] performed, and perhaps should not\n\nhave [performed], were a critical basis for the change in licensure requirements.” Id. at 17.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fPlaintiff misreads DC Water’s argument, and he fails to rebut DC Water’s showing based on his\n\nmisunderstanding of DC Water’s proffered basis for its employment decision.\n\n       The Court finds that plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence from which a\n\nreasonable jury could find that DC Water intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of\n\nrace. Discovery is not warranted, and the Court will grant summary judgment in DC Water’s\n\nfavor on Count III.\n\n                                  E. DCHRA Claims (Count V)\n\n       In the District of Columbia, it is unlawful for an employer “[t]o or refuse to hire, or to\n\ndischarge, any individual; or otherwise to discriminate against any individual, with respect to his\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including promotion; or to limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n\nindividual of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee”\n\non the basis of his race, age, or disability. D.C. Code § 2-1402.11(a). A plaintiff making a claim\n\nunder the DCHRA must do so “within 1 year of the occurrence of the unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice, or the discovery thereof.” D.C. Code § 2-1403.04(a). However, a timely filed charge\n\nwith the EEOC, “which in turn cross-files with DCHRA, tolls the time for filing a private cause\n\nof action under D.C. law.” Esteños v. PAHO/WHO Fed. Credit Union, 952 A.2d 878, 882 (D.C.\n\n2008); see Ellis v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 631 F. Supp. 2d 71, 78 (D.D.C. 2009) (“When a\n\ncharge of discrimination is filed with the EEOC in the District of Columbia, a claim is\n\nautomatically cross-filed with the D.C. Office of Human Rights . . . pursuant to a ‘worksharing\n\nagreement’ between the two agencies.”).\n\n       DC Water argues that plaintiff failed to bring his race, age and disability discrimination\n\nclaims under the DCHRA within the one-year limitations period. Def.’s Mem. at 15-17. Even if\n\n                                                27\n\fthe cross-filing of his EEOC charge with the DCHRA tolled the limitations period, “the tolling\n\nperiod is only one-day long.” Id. at 16. The Court concurs.\n\n       Plaintiff filed his charge of discrimination with the EEOC on May 26, 2015, and the\n\nEEOC issued its notice of right to sue one day later, on May 27, 2015. The limitations period\n\nwould have been “tolled during the processing of the [charge] by the EEOC.” Miller v. Gray, 52\n\nF. Supp. 3d 62, 68 (D.D.C. 2014) (citations omitted); see Alexander v. Washington Metro. Area\n\nTransit Auth., 826 F.3d 544, 551 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (noting that, “generally when a federal court\n\nborrows a limitations period from state law, that law’s tolling provisions come along as part of\n\nthe package”). Tolling “ended when the EEOC issued its right to sue notice[.]” Hammel v.\n\nMarsh USA Inc., 79 F. Supp. 3d 234, 241 (D.D.C. 2015).\n\n       The filing of this lawsuit on September 29, 2016 occurred roughly four months after the\n\nDCHRA’s one-year limitations period expired. The Court has considered and rejected plaintiff’s\n\nassertion that he was non compos mentis during the relevant time period, and absent any\n\nalternative basis for tolling the statute of limitations, plaintiff’s DCHRA claims are time-barred.\n\nThe Court grants summary judgment in DC Water’s favor on Count V.\n\n                                  F. Contract Claim (Count VI)\n\n       Plaintiff claims to have been employed by DC Water “though an express or implied\n\nemployment contract” created by the “employee handbook[.]” Am. Compl. ¶ 36. He alleges\n\nthat DC Water breached the contract “by changing [plaintiff’s] job description[,] giving [him]\n\nless time than other electricians to obtain his [journeyman electrician’s] license,” and by denying\n\nhim “the right to rehire and severance pay provided to other employees.” Id. DC Water asserts,\n\nand plaintiff does not dispute, that “the only express contract that could be at issue is the CBA.”\n\nDef.’s Reply at 21; see Def.’s Mem. at 23; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 13.\n\n                                                 28\n\f                                 1. Res Judicata (Claim Preclusion)\n\n        DC Water notes that the CBA governs plaintiff’s employment terms and conditions, and\n\nits “grievance process . . . is the sole and exclusive remedy . . . a covered employee may use to\n\nseek recovery for a purported breach of the CBA.” Def.’s Mem. at 23. Assuming that plaintiff\n\nactually has a viable breach of contract claim, DC Water contends that it “is based on [an]\n\nargument that [it] breached the CBA when it changed his job description and job requirements\n\nduring the reorganization.” Id. According to DC Water, “[t]hese exact issues were arbitrated . . .\n\nthrough the CBA’s sole and exclusive grievance procedure, and the ruling in DC Water’s favor\n\nhas preclusive effect” on plaintiff’s contract claim. Id.\n\n        “The preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion,\n\nwhich are collectively referred to as ‘res judicata.’” Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892\n\n(2008). Claim preclusion bars a subsequent lawsuit “if there has been prior litigation (1)\n\ninvolving the same claims or cause of action, (2) between the same parties or their privies, and\n\n(3) there has been a final, valid judgment on the merits, (4) by a court of competent jurisdiction.”\n\nSmalls v. United States, 471 F.3d 186, 192 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations omitted); see New\n\nHampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 748 (2001) (“Claim preclusion generally refers to the effect\n\nof a prior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not\n\nrelitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.”).\n\n        DC Water argues, and the Court concurs, that three elements are easily met. A binding\n\narbitration decision is a final decision on the merits, see Century Int’l Arms, Ltd. v. Fed. State\n\nUnitary Enter. State Corp. “Rosvoorouzheinie,” 172 F. Supp. 2d 79, 95 (D.D.C. 2001) (“The\n\ndecisions of binding arbitration proceedings are final decisions on the merits for purposes of res\n\njudicata.”) (citations omitted), and a union member is in privity with his union, see Proctor v.\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\fDistrict of Columbia, 74 F. Supp. 3d 436, 452 (D.D.C. 2014), for claim preclusion purposes.\n\nAlthough the Arbitrator is not a court, there is no dispute that plaintiff is a Union member whose\n\nemployment terms and conditions are governed by the CBA, particularly its provision that\n\narbitration decisions are final and binding decisions on the merits. Cf. Camp v. Kollen, 567 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 170, 173 (D.D.C. 2008) (rejecting argument that arbitrator’s award “is not a final\n\njudgment deserving preclusive effect because the award is unconfirmed” where “the parties\n\nagreed to participate in binding arbitration, the [arbitrator] rendered a ‘final and binding’\n\ndecision on the merits, and neither party has challenged that decision”). Remaining, then, is a\n\ndetermination whether the Union grievance and plaintiff’s contract claim involve the same\n\nclaims or causes of action.\n\n       Two claims need not be “literally identical claims for res judicata to apply.” Capitol Hill\n\nGrp. v. Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, LLP, 574 F. Supp. 2d 143, 149 (D.D.C. 2008), aff’d\n\nsub nom. Capitol Hill Grp. v. Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, Pittman, LLC, 569 F.3d 485 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2009). “Whether two cases implicate the same cause of action turns on whether they share the\n\nsame ‘nucleus of facts.’” Drake v. FAA, 291 F.3d 59, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Page v.\n\nUnited States, 729 F.2d 818, 820 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).\n\n       Plaintiff’s contract claim arose from DC Water’s reorganization: DC Water changed\n\nplaintiff’s job description, negotiated a deadline by which he was to obtain a journeyman\n\nelectrician’s license, and provided training for him and the other Electrical Equipment Repairer\n\n11 employees to prepare for the journeyman electrician’s license examination. The Union could\n\nhave, and opted not to, grieve the change of job description. An Arbitrator addressed the\n\ndeadline and training matters in the context of the Union grievance, and resolved both matters in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fDC Water’s favor. Pursuant to the CBA, the Arbitrator’s decision is binding on all parties,\n\nincluding plaintiff.\n\n        Plaintiff maintains that the Union’s “case is very different from [his] allegations.” Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n at 14. While the Union had heard rumors of a reorganization long before 2014 and had\n\nbeen consulted during the process, plaintiff “faced an abrupt change in his job description” after\n\nhaving worked for DC water for 27 years. Id. He asserts that the Union’s grievance “is not\n\nsufficient to address [his] claim” that DC Water “effectively terminated [him] from his position\n\nwhen [it] changed the job description.” Id. Plaintiff does not explain how or why the Union-\n\ninitiated grievance would have arisen from a set of facts distinct from those supporting his\n\ncontract claim, or why he might avoid the consequences of binding arbitration.\n\n                               2. Right to Rehire and Severance Pay\n\n        In vague terms, plaintiff alleges that “DC Water’s employee handbook created a . . .\n\ncontract” and breached the contract when it “denied [him] the right to rehire and severance pay\n\nprovided to other employees.” Am. Compl. ¶ 36. DC Water moves to dismiss this claim on the\n\nground that the pleading fails to state a contract claim upon which relief can be granted. See\n\ngenerally Def.’s Mem. at 26-29.\n\n        A plaintiff adequately alleges a breach of contract claim by stating that there is a\n\nlegitimate contract between the parties, that a party breached an obligation or duty arising from\n\nthe contract, and that he suffered damages as a result of the breach. See, e.g., Logan v. Lasalle\n\nBank Nat’l Ass’n, 80 A.3d 1014, 1024 (D.C. 2013) (citation omitted); Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t\n\nof Housing & Urban Dev., 963 F. Supp. 1, 6 (D.D.C. 1997) (rejecting implied contract claim\n\nwhere “plaintiffs have not demonstrated an offer, acceptance, or consideration – all essential\n\nelements of a contract which are required to succeed on an implied contract claim”).\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\f       As DC Water notes, see Def.’s Mem. at 27-28, the Amended Complaint addresses none\n\nof these points. Plaintiff neither identifies a policy in an employee handbook which DC Water\n\nbreached, see id., nor alleged the manner by which DC Water breached his purported right to\n\nrehire or for severance pay, id. at 28. Further, on summary judgment, plaintiff’s opposition fails\n\nto produce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence, terms\n\nand breach of an implied contract. See Def.’s Reply at 23-24. Therefore, the Court grants\n\nsummary judgment for DC Water on Count VI.\n\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       DC Water has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and\n\nthat it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiff’s ADA and DCHRA claims are time-\n\nbarred. Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to his ADEA and Title\n\nVII claims. He has not produced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat DC Water intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of race, and his lack of\n\nsuccess on this Section 1981 claim renders moot his request for discovery. Lastly, plaintiff fails\n\nto state a breach of contract claim. Accordingly, the Court grants DC Water’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. An Order is issued separately.\n\n\n\n\nDATE: September 22, 2017                      /s/\n                                              COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                              United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f",

(Count I), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title\n\nVII”), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.

Plaintiff demands declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, litigation expenses and reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n       This matter is before the Court on Defendant District of Columbia Water and Sewer\n\nAuthority’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 18. For the reasons discussed below, the\n\nCourt concludes that plaintiff’s claims under the ADA and the DCHRA are time-barred, that\n\nplaintiff failed to exhaust his age and race discrimination claims under the ADEA and Title VII,\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fthat DC Water did not violate Section 1981 by purposely discriminating against plaintiff on the\n\nbasis of his race, and that plaintiff fails to state a breach of contract claim. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt will grant DC Water’s motion in its entirety.\n\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff is a 55-year old African American man, Pl.’s First Am. Compl., ECF No. 17\n\n(“Am. Compl.”) ¶ 4, who is dyslexic, see id. ¶ 9. DC Water “is an independent authority of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia that provides retail water and wastewater sewer service to the District of\n\nColumbia.” Id. ¶ 5. Its predecessor entity, the District of Columbia Department of Public\n\nWorks, Water and Sewer Administration, hired plaintiff in 1988 as an Electrical Equipment\n\nRepairer 11/CDL. Id. ¶ 6.\n\n       An Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL “perform[ed] a wide range of electrical duties\n\nindependently under the supervision of an electrical foreman.” Def.

See, e.g., Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to\nDef.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 21-1 ¶¶ 4-7. The Court disagrees. A “declaration used to\nsupport . . . a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be\nadmissible in evidence, and show that the . . . declarant is competent to testify on the matters\nstated.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Mr. Sweeney is the Director of Distribution and Conveyance\nSystems at DC Water, Sweeney Decl. ¶ 2, and was involved with the planning an execution of\nthe reorganization and consolidation of the Departments of Sewer, Water and Sewer Pump\nMaintenance into a single Department of Distribution and Conveyance Systems, id. ¶ 4. These\nare the circumstances under which plaintiff’s claims arose, about which Mr. Sweeney has\npersonal knowledge and about which Mr. Sweeney is competent to testify. DC Water “is not\nrequired to produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial” at the summary\njudgment stage, as long as “the evidence [is] capable of being converted into admissible\nevidence.” Gleklen v.

Management identified positions to abolish and identified “new positions . . . to create to\n\nreplace the abolished positions and/or meet new organizational requirements.” Id. ¶ 6. One of\n\nthe positions slated for abolishment was the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL position. Id.\n\n¶ 7. DC Water announced the reorganization in 2014. Id.\n\n       It came to light during the reorganization process that District of Columbia licensure\n\nrequirements for electricians required direct supervision over “employees holding only an\n\napprentice electrician’s license [by] a person holding a master electrician’s license[.]” Id. ¶ 9.\n\nDC Water sought guidance from the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and\n\nRegulatory Affairs, see id., which advised:\n\n               Pursuant to District law, “[a]n apprentice electrician shall work only\n               under the direct personal supervision and control of a licensed\n               master electrician or licensed master electrician specialist.” See\n               D.C. Official Code §47-2853.92(a) (2010 Repl.). Accordingly, an\n               apprentice electrician employed by [DC Water] must be directly\n               supervised, which means that a qualified individual must be present\n\n\nCir. 2000) (emphasis in original). The Court is satisfied that the statements set forth in Mr.\nSweeney’s declaration are capable of being converted into admissible, non-hearsay evidence if\nhe were to testify at trial.

Further, District\n               law specifies that a master electrician or master electrician specialist\n               must provide the necessary supervision. Therefore, a licensed\n               journeyman electrician cannot supervise an apprentice. Thus, to\n               comply with District law, any Electrical Foreman or General\n               Foreman employed by [DC Water who] supervises the performance\n               of electrical work must be licensed as a master electrician or master\n               electrician specialist, as only a licensed master is legally authorized\n               to assume responsible charge over the performance of electrical\n               work in the District.\nId., Ex. 2 (Letter to Stephanie Black, Manager, Learning and Development, DC Water, from\n\nPamela Hall, Program Support Specialist, D.C.

Management\n\ndetermined that, “[g]iven the financial and practical objectives of the planned reorganization, it\n\nwas not practical or reasonable for DC Water to hire additional master electricians to\n\nindividually oversee each Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL.” Id. Instead, DC Water\n\n“change[d] the minimum license qualifications for the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL\n\nposition, and create[d] the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position to replace it.” Id. ¶ 11.\n\nEach Industrial Journeyman Electrician was required to have a journeyman electrician’s license\n\nand a CDL.

Id.\n\n       The Union and DC Water disagreed about the length of time within which an Electrical\n\nEquipment Repairer 11/CDL was to obtain a journeyman electrician’s license. The Union\n\nproposed that an “employee[] holding an apprentice electrician’s license be permitted a total of\n\nfour (4) years to obtain [a] journeyman electrician’s license.” Id. ¶ 19. DC Water rejected this\n\nproposed timeframe because the journeyman electrician’s license requirement was a legal\n\nrequirement. Id. Ultimately DC Water and the Union entered into a Memorandum of\n\nAgreement (“MOA”), and with respect to the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 positions, the\n\nparties agreed:\n\n                  Current DC Water bargaining unit employees[] in the position of\n                  Electrical Equipment Repairer possessing a DC Apprentice\n                  Electrician[’s] license selected for Industrial Journeyman\n                  Electrician and Industrial Specialist Electrician positions shall have\n                  until March 31, 2015 to acquire the required DC Journeyman\n                  Electrician[’s] license.

However, he “did not believe the\n\ncourse sufficiently prepared him for the examination,” in part because “the course instructor\n\nadmitted that [the] course was designed as a refresher for people who had already passed the test\n\npreviously, and it was not meant for first-time test takers.” Id.\n\n       “In the fall of 2014, [plaintiff] told various members of human resources . . . that he is\n\ndyslexic and needed additional time and to go to class if DC Water wanted him to obtain a\n\n[journeyman electrician’s] license.” Id. ¶ 9. “They refused to give him the additional time,” id.,\n\neven though “other DC Water electricians, including Caucasian and younger electricians,” were\n\ngiven 18 months to two years to obtain their licenses, and “some were even allowed to go back\n\nto school, id. ¶ 10. For example, according to plaintiff, there were employees “in the machine\n\nshop division [who] were not subject to the new [j]ourneyman [e]lectrician[’s] license\n\nrequirement[.]” Id. Plaintiff “tried to obtain a doctor’s medical certification to show that he is\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fdyslexic,” but he was not able to do so until May 13, 2015.

On “[c]onsider[ation of] the evidence presented and the arguments in\n\nthe briefs,” id., Ex. 14 at 20, the Arbitrator fashioned his own statement of four issues to be\n\ndecided, two of which are relevant here:\n\n               Did [DC Water] violate the MOA or Articles 4 or 18 of the [CBA]\n               when it required Electrical Equipment Repairer . . . 11s to convert\n               to the job classifications of Industrial Journeyman Electrician or\n               Industrial Specialist Electrician and to obtain a CDL and\n               journeyman electrician[’s] license?\n\n               Did [DC Water] violate Article 34, Section A of the [CBA] when\n               the MOA required Industrial Journeyman Electricians and Industrial\n               Specialist Electricians to obtain new licenses by March [31], 2015?\nId., Ex. 14 at 21. 5 The Arbitrator found that DC Water did not violate any of the relevant CBA\n\nor MOA provisions, and denied the grievance. Id., Ex. 14 at 40. The Arbitrator’s decision in DC\n\nWater’s favor was binding on both parties. Id., Ex. 10 at 86 (Art. 58, Sec. 1, para. 12).\n\n\n4\n   Plaintiff claims to have told human resources personnel that he has dyslexia, yet he fails to\nidentify the person(s) he notified, indicate whether or to whom he delivered the medical\ncertification, or identify the person(s) to whom he directed his request(s) for accommodation.\nPlaintiff points to no materials in the record to show that DC Water actually knew he has\ndyslexia, and he cannot establish this fact on summary judgment by relying on the allegations of\nhis Amended Complaint. See Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to\nDef.’s Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 20-22, 24 (citing Am. Compl. ¶ 17). He has cited no evidence in the\nrecord to support this claim. In addition, there is no evidence in the record that the Dr.\nOlarinde’s report with the diagnosis of dyslexia ever was provided to DC Water.\n5\n  In relevant part, Article 4 provides that DC Water “shall give the President of the Union\nadvance written notice of changes in personnel policies, practices, or working conditions\naffecting employees covered by this Agreement.” Sweeney Decl., Ex. 10 at 2 (Art. 4, Sec. B,\npara. 2). Article 18 pertains to the release of information. See id., Ex. 10 (Table of Contents).\n                                                  8\n\f       There were seven incumbent Electrical Equipment Repairer 11/CDL employees eligible\n\nfor the newly-created Industrial Journey Electrician positions: six are African-American and one\n\nis Caucasian. Sweeney Decl. ¶ 29. Two of the African-American employees already had\n\njourneyman electrician’s licenses. Id. One African-American employee and the Caucasian\n\nemployee “successfully tested for, and obtained, a journeyman electrician’s license.” Id.\n\nPlaintiff and the two remaining African-American employees did not obtain a journeyman\n\nelectrician’s license by the March 31, 2015 deadline. Id. ¶ 30. In April 2015, plaintiff\n\n“submitted his application for the Journeyman Electrician license exam, and was authorized to\n\ntake the exam on June 1, 2015.” Am. Compl. ¶ 12.\n\n       On April 1, 2015, Charles Sweeney, Director of Distribution and Conveyance Systems,\n\nSweeney Decl. ¶ 3, sent plaintiff a letter “informing him of his failure to meet the licensure\n\nrequirement to convert to the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position” by the March 31, 2015\n\ndeadline, id. ¶ 30; see id., Ex. 12 (Letter to plaintiff from Charles Sweeney dated April 1, 2015).\n\nDC Water declined to terminate plaintiff’s employment at that time. Id. ¶ 31. Instead, “DC\n\nWater removed him from his position as an electrician on April 1, 2015,” Am. Compl. ¶ 12, and\n\nallowed him (and the two other African-American employees who failed to meet the March 31,\n\n2015 deadline) an additional 60 days, to May 31, 2015, to obtain a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense, Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 31-32; see id., Ex. 12 (Acknowledgment of Receipt of Sixty (60) day\n\nNotice to Obtain a Journeyman Electrician[’s] License). Plaintiff and two other African-\n\nAmericans “were the only Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 employees provided additional time\n\n\n\n\nArticle 34 pertains to employee licenses and certifications. If DC Water finds that “employees\nholding certain positions should be certified or licensed, [it] agrees to assure that all employees\nwho are employed in such positions . . . shall be trained and otherwise assisted in satisfying this\nrequirement.” Id., Ex. 10 at 42 (Art. 34, Sec. A).\n                                                 9\n\fto obtain the required license.” Id. ¶ 32. Still, plaintiff failed to obtain the license, and DC\n\nWater terminated his employment effective May 31, 2015. Id. ¶ 34; see id., Ex. 13 (Personnel\n\nAction Report). He “received no benefits as part of the reduction-in-force (RIF) or severance\n\npackage from the termination,” and he was not eligible for rehire, see Sweeney Decl., Ex. 13, as\n\nwere other DC Water employees, Am. Compl. ¶ 12.\n\n       “On May 26, 2015, [plaintiff] went to the Washington Field Office of the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission [EEOC],” where he filed a charge of discrimination,\n\ncompleted an intake report, and signed an agreement to mediate his discrimination charges. Id. ¶\n\n13. To indicate the basis of discrimination, plaintiff only checked the box marked\n\n“DISABILITY.” See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. A (Charge of Discrimination dated May 26, 2015). He\n\nstated that the alleged discrimination took place between April 1, 2015 and May 26, 2015, and\n\ninvolved “CONTINUING ACTION.” Id., Ex. A. The narrative section of the charge read:\n\n               I work as an Electrical Equipment Repair[er] 11/CDL for the DC\n               Water and Sewer Authority . . . . I have a disability and require\n               reasonable accommodations.        I have documentation that\n               demonstrates that I am disabled and require reasonable\n               accommodations.\n\n               I require a reasonable accommodation so that I can obtain the\n               training for the . . . the Journeyman Electrician[’s] License. My\n               Employer has not provided me with reasonable accommodations for\n               the training required to obtain th[is] license[]. Because I have been\n               unable to obtain th[is] license[] I have been laid off.\n\n               I believe that my layoff (and possible subsequent termination as a\n               result of being unable to obtain these licenses) was discriminatory\n               in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as\n               amended[] (“ADA”)[,] and that my Employer has failed to provide[]\n               me with a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA.\nId., Ex. A.\n\n       The EEOC “issued a Notice of Right to Sue on May 27, 2015.” Am. Compl. ¶ 13. It\n\nadvised plaintiff that, if he chose to file a lawsuit, the must do so within 90 days of his receipt of\n\n                                                  10\n\fthe notice. See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. H (Dismissal and Notice of Rights dated May 27, 2015).\n\nProceeding pro se, plaintiff filed his original complaint, ECF No. 1, on September 29, 2016. 6 He\n\nsubsequently retained counsel who filed an amended complaint, ECF No. 17, on his behalf.\n\n\n                                           II. DISCUSSION\n\n                                  A. Summary Judgment Standard\n\n        DC Water moves for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Fed. R .Civ. P. 56(a). A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must\n\nsupport the assertion by “citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including\n\ndepositions, documents . . . affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . . , admissions, [or]\n\ninterrogatory answers[, or by] showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or\n\npresence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to\n\nsupport the fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). “If a party fails to properly support an assertion of\n\nfact or fails to properly address another party’s assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the\n\ncourt may . . . consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n        When considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court cannot make credibility\n\ndeterminations or weigh the evidence; the evidence must be analyzed in the light most favorable\n\n\n\n\n6\n   It is the practice of the Clerk of Court to date stamp each pleading upon receipt. Review of the\ndocket reveals that the Clerk of Court received plaintiff’s original complaint, ECF No. 1, and his\napplication to proceed in forma pauperis, ECF No. 2, on September 29, 2016, that the Court\ngranted plaintiff’s application on October 14, 2016, and that the Clerk of Court officially filed\nboth documents on CM/ECF on October 20, 2016. The Court treats the original complaint as if\nit had been filed on September 29, 2016.\n                                                   11\n\fto the nonmoving party, with all justifiable inferences drawn in his favor.

ADA Claim (Count I)\n\n       DC Water moves for summary judgment on Count I of the Amended Complaint on the\n\nground that plaintiff’s ADA claim is time-barred. Def.’s Mem. at 7. The Notice of Right to Sue\n\nincludes a warning that any lawsuit was to be filed within 90 days of the claimant’s receipt of the\n\nnotice. See Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. H. DC Water contends that plaintiff filed his lawsuit “nearly\n\nseventeen (17) months after he received his Notice of Right to Sue, and approximately fourteen\n\n(14) months after the expiration of [his] deadline to initiate his ADA suit.” Def.’s Mem. at 8\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       The Amended Complaint does not specify the date on which plaintiff received the Notice\n\nof Right to Sue. However, he does not deny DC Water’s assertions that he received the notice on\n\nMay 27, 2015, that he had until August 25, 2015 to file a lawsuit under the ADA, and that he\n\nfiled his original complaint on September 29, 2016. See Def.’s Statement of Undisputed Facts in\n\n                                                12\n\fSupport of its Mot. for Summ.

See Pl.’s Opp’n at 12-13. Plaintiff\n\nhas dyslexia, a learning disability, which he claims rendered him non compos mentis and thus\n\nincapable of handling his affairs between May 30, 2015 and September 29, 2016.

For this reason, plaintiff\n\nasserts, his lawsuit should be considered timely filed.\n\n       Under District of Columbia law, “when a person entitled to maintain an action is, at the\n\ntime the right of action accrues . . . non compos mentis . . . he or his proper representative may\n\nbring action within the time limited after the disability is removed.” D.C.

Indicia of non compos mentis status might include a showing that\n\nplaintiff has been “adjudged incompetent, signed a power of attorney, had a guardian or\n\ncaretaker appointed, or otherwise took measures to let someone else handle [his] affairs[.]”\n\nSpeiser, 670 F. Supp. at 385.\n\n        Plaintiff relied on the reports of Emmanuel A. Olarinde, Ph.D., a licensed clinical\n\npsychologist, one of which was prepared prior to his termination. Plaintiff had “referred himself\n\nfor a psychoeducational evaluation . . . designed to assess [his] cognitive ability [and] academic\n\nachievement in reading and mathematics.” Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. E-1 (Clinical Neuropsychological\n\nEvaluation dated May 13, 2015) at 1. 7 Dr. Olarinde observed:\n\n                [Plaintiff] came to the testing sessions [on April 13, April 20, and\n                April 27, 2015] well kept, and groomed. Hygiene was effectively\n                managed and he dressed appropriately for the occasion . . . . Facial\n                expression was responsive, and eye contact was appropriate.\n                [Plaintiff] demonstrated normal activity level and he appeared not\n                to be easily aroused by extraneous environmental stimuli . . . .\n\n                [Plaintiff’s] speech was spontaneous but with significant\n                articulation problems.      However[,] communication with the\n                examiner was not impeded in any significant way either receptively\n                or expressively. His thinking was assessed through his speech\n                production. [Plaintiff’s] though process was coherent, logical and\n                goal directed. He was able to reach his goal of thoughts without\n                significant digression. Thought content was devoid of delusion,\n                phobia, obsession, suicide, homicide, preoccupied ideas, or any\n                symptoms of psychosis . . . .\n\n                Major components of his memory, such as, immediate, short-term\n                and remote memories[,] appeared to be intact. [Plaintiff] did not\n                exhibit significant attention and concentration problems. [He] was\n                adequately oriented to time, place and person . . . . He complied\n                with the examiner’s guidelines and performed all the tasks and\n                answered all the questions presented to him.\n\nId., Ex. E-1 at 1-2.\n\n\n7\n  Plaintiff produces two evaluations, one dated May 13, 2015 and the other dated September 13,\n2015. The Court designates the former “Ex. E-1” and the latter “Ex. E-2.”\n                                                14\n\f       Subsequent testing with respect to plaintiff’s intellectual ability revealed that plaintiff’s\n\n“reasoning abilities on verbal tasks are generally in the low average range . . . while his\n\nnonverbal reasoning abilities are significantly higher and in the average range.” Id., Ex. E-2\n\n(Clinical Neuropsychological Evaluation dated September 13, 2015) at 4. Further, Dr. Olarinde\n\nfound that plaintiff’s “ability to sustain attention, concentrate, and exert mental control is in the\n\nlow average range,” and his “ability in processing simple or routine visual material without\n\nmaking errors is in the average range.” Id., Ex. E-2 at 4.\n\n       Dr. Olarinde concluded that plaintiff would “have serious difficulties in learning and\n\nmemory in any training that involves reading and writing.” Id., Ex. E-1 at 4. With respect to\n\nplaintiff’s reading ability, Dr. Olarinde found “[a] relative weakness in decoding words as\n\ncompared to reading words in isolation,” which “may indicate that [plaintiff] has difficulty\n\napplying phonetic rules for decoding words but may not have learned vocabulary words to\n\nautomaticity.” Id., Ex. E-1 at 2-3. He concluded that plaintiff “has a disorder of the basic\n\npsychological process involved in understanding or in using written language that manifest[s]\n\nitself in an imperfect ability to read[,] write and spell, or to do mathematical calculations,\n\nincluding conditions such as visual and auditory perceptual disabilities and dyslexia.” Id., Ex. E-\n\n1 at 4 (emphasis removed). Only after this second round of testing did Dr. Olarinde appear to\n\ndiagnose a “[r]eading [d]isorder with impairment in word reading and reading comprehension\n\n(dyslexia),” recommending that plaintiff’s employer “accommodate for his reading disabilities”\n\nby using “a device where instructions or test items or questions are read to him.” Id., Ex. E-2 at\n\n6.\n\n       In addition, plaintiff pointed to errors he made as evidence of his inability to comprehend\n\nhis legal rights. When he “attempted to complete the EEOC Charge of Discrimination form . . .\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fhe selected the box that stated he does not have a disability and selected ‘genetic information’ as\n\nthe type of discrimination he faced on the EEO questionnaire.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 12; see id. Exs. A,\n\nF. He also “stated that he faced a ‘layoff’ on April 1, 2015, because he did not understand DC\n\nWater’s letter [to mean] that he needed to complete his license within sixty days.” Id.; see id.,\n\nEx. C. Further, he pointed to his misidentification of his former employer on his pro se\n\ncomplaint as “DC Water Is Life,” and he even wrote down the incorrect zip code for his home\n\naddress. Id. And among other examples, plaintiff referred to the quality of his pro se complaint\n\nand DC Water’s need to file a “motion for a more definite statement due to the limited facts\n\npresented and nonexistent legal allegation” as proof that he “was absolutely unable to manage his\n\nown legal affairs.” Id. at 13.\n\n       Missing from plaintiff’s opposition are any references to materials in the record of this\n\ncase tending to show that plaintiff could not manage his own affairs or otherwise function in\n\nsociety because of a reading disorder. Nothing is known about plaintiff’s activities and mental or\n\nphysical condition during this supposed period of incapacity. Plaintiff does not claim that his\n\njudgment was impaired or that his physical or mental health was compromised. He neither\n\nidentifies an event that suddenly triggered his incapacity on May 30, 2015, nor explains how his\n\nincapacity was removed on September 29, 2016, the day he filed his original pro se complaint.\n\n       Rather, plaintiff’s actions immediately prior to the purported onset of his non compus\n\nmentis status on May 30, 2015 reflect an understanding that his employment with DC Water was\n\nat risk unless he could obtain a journeyman electrician’s license, that his dyslexia is a basis for\n\nrequesting a reasonable accommodation to prepare for the licensure examination, that DC Water\n\nmay have discriminated against him because of his disability, and that the EEOC was an\n\nappropriate place to seek relief. Dr. Olarinde’s observations, particularly his assessment that\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fplaintiff’s “thought process was coherent, logical and goal directed,” Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex.

Nor\n\nshall an employer “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of [his] age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1).\n\n       A plaintiff bringing employment discrimination claims under Title VII and the ADEA\n\nfirst must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.

See Def.’s Mem. at 8-10. It notes that\n\nplaintiff’s charge of discrimination “contains neither a checked box for ‘race’ or ‘age,’ nor does\n\nthe factual narrative include any reference to discrimination based on age or race, or to\n\n[plaintiff’s] age or race.” Id. at 9. Rather, “the checked boxes and factual narrative only include\n\nallegations of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate,” such that “no reasonable\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\freading and/or interpretation of the Charge . . . allows the inference that [plaintiff] intended to\n\nbring claims of race and age discrimination, or even contemplated the existence of any such\n\nclaims at the time of filing the Charge.” Id. at 9-10.\n\n       Plaintiff argues that his failure to check the boxes for race and age discrimination is not\n\ndispositive. Rather, he contends that his race and age discrimination claims “would have arisen\n\nfrom an investigation of his charge of discrimination” based on his disability because all of his\n\nclaims “arose from the same factual circumstances.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 10. And, he asserts, his\n\nIntake Questionnaire indicates his intention to list the ages of certain employees whom DC\n\nWater treated more favorably than it treated plaintiff, see id., Ex. F (Intake Questionnaire) at 2,\n\nfrom which the EEOC was to divine an age discrimination claim. Similarly, he asserts that an\n\ninvestigation as to “timing concerns regarding the Journeyman license would give rise to [his]\n\nclaims of race and age discrimination.” Id. at 11. The Court is not persuaded.\n\n       A Title VII claim “must arise from the administrative investigation that can reasonably be\n\nexpected to follow the charge of discrimination.” Park, 71 F.3d at 907 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted). It simply is not reasonable to conclude that an investigation of the\n\nallegations in plaintiff’s EEOC charge, particularly in light of its repeated mention of “disability”\n\nand “reasonable accommodation,” would uncover a claim of discrimination based on race or age.\n\nSee Hicklin v.

Because there were not enough master electricians in\n\nDC Water’s employ to supervise directly each Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 with only an\n\napprentice electrician’s license, and because DC Water lacked the resources to hire a sufficient\n\nnumber of master electricians, it opted to “chang[] the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 position\n\ninto the Industrial Journeyman Electrician position.” Id. at 12-13.

If Utility Systems Operators are the similarly-situated employees plaintiff deems\n\ncomparators, these employees are not even mentioned in the list of matters about which plaintiff\n\nclaims discovery is needed. 8\n\n        Utility Systems Operators are not electricians, and nothing in the record of this case\n\ndemonstrates that these non-electricians are viable comparators. Furthermore, in the context of\n\n\n\n8\n  Nor does counsel explain why he could not produce items such as plaintiff’s medical records,\ndocuments relating to plaintiff’s ability to manage his own affairs, and requests for\naccommodations for plaintiff’s alleged disability. See Decl. Pursuant to Rule 56(d) of the Fed.\nR. Civ. P. in Support of Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. ¶¶ 7-9. These matters are\ndiscoverable (even if DC Water is unlikely to have information such as plaintiff’s medical\nrecords, for example), within the realm of plaintiff’s personal knowledge, or otherwise accessible\nto plaintiff absent formal discovery.\n                                                  25\n\fthis case, plaintiff does not demonstrate that African American electricians were disadvantaged\n\nin any way. There is but one Caucasian electrician in plaintiff’s situation -- he was offered the\n\nsame training opportunity plaintiff was offered, and he obtained a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense by the March 31, 2015 deadline. Arguably, DC Water treated plaintiff and two fellow\n\nAfrican American electricians more favorably by allowing them two additional months, to May\n\n31, 2015, to obtain the required journeyman electrician’s license.\n\n       Next, plaintiff argues that DC Water changed his position description because there had\n\nbeen a change in District of Columbia law. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 5-6. “The clause governing the\n\nlimitation of those who hold an apprentice [electrician’s] license ha[s] not changed since at least\n\n1981.” Id. at 6. Thus, for his entire tenure at DC Water, plaintiff “worked under the supervision\n\nof an Electrical Foreman, not a Master Electrician,” such that DC Water had “been breaking\n\nD.C. statutory law” for decades. Id. According to plaintiff, these circumstances “suggest[] that\n\n[DC Water’s] purported justification for the change of [plaintiff’s] position is false and pretext\n\nfor unlawful discrimination.” Id.\n\n       DC Water does not argue that there had been a change in law regarding electrician’s\n\nlicenses. Rather, it explains, in order “[t]o come into compliance with applicable regulations\n\nalready on the books, DC Water abolished the Electrical Equipment Repairer 11 position” and\n\ncreated the Industrial Journeyman Electrician in its place. Def.’s Reply at 16 (emphasis in\n\noriginal); see Sweeney Decl. ¶¶ 8-12. An “Industrial Journeyman Electrician . . . would perform\n\nsimilar duties, but had a job description which explicitly required a journeyman electrician’s\n\nlicense. Def.’s Reply at 16. “The tasks and duties [plaintiff] performed, and perhaps should not\n\nhave [performed], were a critical basis for the change in licensure requirements.” Id. at 17.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fPlaintiff misreads DC Water’s argument, and he fails to rebut DC Water’s showing based on his\n\nmisunderstanding of DC Water’s proffered basis for its employment decision.\n\n       The Court finds that plaintiff has not produced sufficient evidence from which a\n\nreasonable jury could find that DC Water intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of\n\nrace. Discovery is not warranted, and the Court will grant summary judgment in DC Water’s\n\nfavor on Count III.\n\n                                  E. DCHRA Claims (Count V)\n\n       In the District of Columbia, it is unlawful for an employer “[t]o or refuse to hire, or to\n\ndischarge, any individual; or otherwise to discriminate against any individual, with respect to his\n\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including promotion; or to limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n\nindividual of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee”\n\non the basis of his race, age, or disability. D.C. Code § 2-1402.11(a). A plaintiff making a claim\n\nunder the DCHRA must do so “within 1 year of the occurrence of the unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice, or the discovery thereof.” D.C. Code § 2-1403.04(a). However, a timely filed charge\n\nwith the EEOC, “which in turn cross-files with DCHRA, tolls the time for filing a private cause\n\nof action under D.C. law.” Esteños v.

The Court has considered and rejected plaintiff’s\n\nassertion that he was non compos mentis during the relevant time period, and absent any\n\nalternative basis for tolling the statute of limitations, plaintiff’s DCHRA claims are time-barred.\n\nThe Court grants summary judgment in DC Water’s favor on Count V.\n\n                                  F. Contract Claim (Count VI)\n\n       Plaintiff claims to have been employed by DC Water “though an express or implied\n\nemployment contract” created by the “employee handbook[.]” Am. Compl. ¶ 36. He alleges\n\nthat DC Water breached the contract “by changing [plaintiff’s] job description[,] giving [him]\n\nless time than other electricians to obtain his [journeyman electrician’s] license,” and by denying\n\nhim “the right to rehire and severance pay provided to other employees.” Id. DC Water asserts,\n\nand plaintiff does not dispute, that “the only express contract that could be at issue is the CBA.”\n\nDef.’s Reply at 21; see Def.’s Mem. at 23; see also Pl.’s Opp’n at 13.\n\n                                                 28\n\f                                 1. Res Judicata (Claim Preclusion)\n\n        DC Water notes that the CBA governs plaintiff’s employment terms and conditions, and\n\nits “grievance process . . . is the sole and exclusive remedy . . . a covered employee may use to\n\nseek recovery for a purported breach of the CBA.” Def.’s Mem. at 23. Assuming that plaintiff\n\nactually has a viable breach of contract claim, DC Water contends that it “is based on [an]\n\nargument that [it] breached the CBA when it changed his job description and job requirements\n\nduring the reorganization.” Id. According to DC Water, “[t]hese exact issues were arbitrated . . .\n\nthrough the CBA’s sole and exclusive grievance procedure, and the ruling in DC Water’s favor\n\nhas preclusive effect” on plaintiff’s contract claim. Id.\n\n        “The preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion,\n\nwhich are collectively referred to as ‘res judicata.’” Taylor v.

The Union could\n\nhave, and opted not to, grieve the change of job description. An Arbitrator addressed the\n\ndeadline and training matters in the context of the Union grievance, and resolved both matters in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fDC Water’s favor. Pursuant to the CBA, the Arbitrator’s decision is binding on all parties,\n\nincluding plaintiff.\n\n        Plaintiff maintains that the Union’s “case is very different from [his] allegations.” Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n at 14. While the Union had heard rumors of a reorganization long before 2014 and had\n\nbeen consulted during the process, plaintiff “faced an abrupt change in his job description” after\n\nhaving worked for DC water for 27 years. Id. He asserts that the Union’s grievance “is not\n\nsufficient to address [his] claim” that DC Water “effectively terminated [him] from his position\n\nwhen [it] changed the job description.” Id. Plaintiff does not explain how or why the Union-\n\ninitiated grievance would have arisen from a set of facts distinct from those supporting his\n\ncontract claim, or why he might avoid the consequences of binding arbitration.\n\n                               2. Right to Rehire and Severance Pay\n\n        In vague terms, plaintiff alleges that “DC Water’s employee handbook created a . . .\n\ncontract” and breached the contract when it “denied [him] the right to rehire and severance pay\n\nprovided to other employees.” Am. Compl. ¶ 36. DC Water moves to dismiss this claim on the\n\nground that the pleading fails to state a contract claim upon which relief can be granted. See\n\ngenerally Def.’s Mem. at 26-29.\n\n        A plaintiff adequately alleges a breach of contract claim by stating that there is a\n\nlegitimate contract between the parties, that a party breached an obligation or duty arising from\n\nthe contract, and that he suffered damages as a result of the breach.

Plaintiff neither identifies a policy in an employee handbook which DC Water\n\nbreached, see id., nor alleged the manner by which DC Water breached his purported right to\n\nrehire or for severance pay, id. at 28. Further, on summary judgment, plaintiff’s opposition fails\n\nto produce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence, terms\n\nand breach of an implied contract. See Def.’s Reply at 23-24. Therefore, the Court grants\n\nsummary judgment for DC Water on Count VI.\n\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       DC Water has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and\n\nthat it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiff’s ADA and DCHRA claims are time-\n\nbarred. Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to his ADEA and Title\n\nVII claims. He has not produced sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat DC Water intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of race, and his lack of\n\nsuccess on this Section 1981 claim renders moot his request for discovery. Lastly, plaintiff fails\n\nto state a breach of contract claim. Accordingly, the Court grants DC Water’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. An Order is issued separately.\n\n\n\n\nDATE: September 22, 2017                      /s/\n                                              COLLEEN KOLLAR-KOTELLY\n                                              United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f</pre>",
