(D. Colorado)\n SGT. CELLA; C.O. REYES; LT.              (D.C. No. 1:07-cv-01126-WDM-KMT)\n KENTOPLISS; LT. FAZZINO;\n EVANS, Case Manager; R. VIOLA,\n Mail Officer; LT. TOLLIS; FOSHEE,\n Associate Warden; ABBOTT, Warden,\n\n               Defendants - Appellees.\n\n\n                            ORDER AND JUDGMENT *\n\n\nBefore HARTZ, EBEL, and O’BRIEN, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n      Michael Doyle, a prisoner proceeding pro se, sued officials at the Colorado\n\nTerritorial Correctional Facility under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging a number of\n\nconstitutional violations. In a thorough opinion the United States District Court\n\n\n\n\n      *\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is\nnot binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata,\nand collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value\nconsistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\ffor the District of Colorado dismissed his suit in its entirety. We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\n\n      We begin by summarizing Mr. Doyle’s claims and the district court’s\n\nreasons for dismissing them: First, Mr. Doyle claimed a violation of his due-\n\nprocess rights when, without a hearing, he was placed on restricted-privilege\n\nstatus for fourteen-and-a-half months following an incident in which he refused to\n\nwork in the prison kitchen. The district court dismissed this claim because\n\nMr. Doyle failed to demonstrate a liberty interest for which process was due. To\n\ndo so, he had to establish that restricted-privilege status “impose[d] atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship on [him] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\nEstate of DiMarco v. Wyo. Dep’t of Corr., 473 F.3d 1334, 1339 (10th Cir. 2007)\n\n(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). But the district court noted that\n\nthe hardships Mr. Doyle alluded to in his pleadings—restrictions on his use of\n\npersonal property and on socializing with other inmates—did not rise to the level\n\nof atypical hardships. Nor did his placement in what he characterized as a\n\n“punishment cell with ‘Aids inmates,’” R. Doc. 28 at 9, because he failed to\n\npresent specific allegations regarding a physical threat from the specified inmates.\n\n      Second, Mr. Doyle claimed that another due-process violation occurred\n\nwhen, after already being placed on restricted-privilege status, he was placed in\n\nadministrative segregation because he refused to go to his cell after being ordered\n\nto do so. The district court ruled that such placement did not implicate a liberty\n\n                                         -2-\n\finterest because all that Mr. Doyle was alleging was that he had been placed in\n\nadministrative segregation pending a disciplinary hearing, which failed to\n\nconstitute an atypical or significant hardship.\n\n      Third, Mr. Doyle claimed that he did not receive a fair disciplinary hearing\n\nregarding the second incident because (1) the two officers involved in the\n\nincident, Sergeant Cella and Correctional Officer Reyes, allegedly submitted false\n\nreports of the incident; (2) at the hearing he was not allowed to utilize a\n\nsurveillance-video tape of the incident; and (3) he was not allowed to call Cella\n\nand Reyes as witnesses. Ultimately, Mr. Doyle’s claims amount to challenges to\n\nhis convictions for violating the Colorado Department of Corrections Code of\n\nPenal Discipline (COPD). But, as the district court noted, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is\n\ninapplicable to “‘challenges to punishments imposed as a result of prison\n\ndisciplinary infractions,’” unless the disciplinary conviction has been set aside.\n\nR. Doc. 91 at 7 (quoting Cardoso v. Calbone, 490 F.3d 1194, 1199 (10th Cir.\n\n2007)). Because Mr. Doyle’s COPD convictions have not been set aside, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed his fair-hearing claim.\n\n      Fourth, Mr. Doyle claimed that Cella and Reyes destroyed or confiscated\n\nproperty in his cell, including his headphones and glasses, when they transferred\n\nhim to administrative segregation. The district court said that if the claim is\n\nbased on the officials’ negligence, it is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nwhich extends only to deliberate deprivations of constitutional rights. See Rost\n\n                                         -3-\n\fex rel. K.C. v. Steamboat Springs RE-2 Sch. Dist., 511 F.3d 1114, 1126 (10th Cir.\n\n2008) (“[N]egligent government conduct is insufficient to prove liability under\n\n§ 1983.”). And if Mr. Doyle’s claim rested on deliberate misconduct, the court\n\nnoted, he ran into a separate barrier: Intentional destruction of property does not\n\nviolate due process if there are adequate state postdeprivation remedies. See\n\nMoore v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 507 F.3d 1257, 1260 (10th Cir. 2007). As the\n\ndistrict court observed, Colorado provides such a remedy because Colo. Rev. Stat.\n\n§ 24-10-105(1) allows tort actions against public employees for “willful and\n\nwanton” actions.\n\n      Fifth, Mr. Doyle claimed that his right to access to the courts was violated.\n\nHe alleged that he did not receive various mailings that he had requested from\n\nlegal-service organizations. The district court rejected this claim because\n\nMr. Doyle failed to show how the denial of legal materials frustrated his ability to\n\npursue a nonfrivolous legal claim. See Penrod v. Zavaras, 94 F.3d 1399, 1403\n\n(10th Cir. 1996) (to challenge the denial of legal resources, a litigant must show\n\nthat the denial “hindered the prisoner’s efforts to pursue a nonfrivolous claim”).\n\nMr. Doyle also alleged that letters he sent to law firms seeking representation\n\nwere “[r]efused.” R. Doc. 8 at 12. The district court rejected this claim because\n\nMr. Doyle failed to specify how any of the named defendants were personally\n\ninvolved in the refusal. See Trujillo v. Williams, 465 F.3d 1210, 1227 (10th Cir.\n\n2006) (“In order for liability to arise under § 1983, a defendant’s direct personal\n\n                                         -4-\n\fresponsibility for the claimed deprivation of a constitutional right must be\n\nestablished.”).\n\n      Finally, the district court dismissed claims that were not specifically\n\ndenominated in Mr. Doyle’s complaint. To the extent that he asserted claims\n\nagainst two named defendants, Warden Abbott and Associate Warden Foshee,\n\nthose were dismissed because Mr. Doyle failed to allege with specificity their\n\npersonal involvement in the asserted misconduct. And to the extent that\n\nMr. Doyle’s vague and meandering complaint alluded to claims other than those\n\ndisposed of above, the district court dismissed them all for failure to comply with\n\nthe requirement of a “short and plain statement of the claim.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n8(a)(2).\n\n      For substantially the reasons stated by the district court, we AFFIRM. We\n\nDENY Mr. Doyle’s pending motions, including those seeking a change of venue\n\nand leave to appeal without prepayment of filing fees. We ORDER Mr. Doyle to\n\npay immediately the unpaid balance due.\n\n                                       ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n\n                                       Harris L Hartz\n                                       Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f",
