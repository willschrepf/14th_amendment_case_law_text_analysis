Filed:         OCT 2 6 2M?\n\n      YU, J. — Yakima County Clerk Janelle Riddle appeals the trial court's\n\nruling that five out of the six recall charges filed against her are factually and\n\nlegally sufficient. We granted the recall petitioners' motion for accelerated review\n\nand now affirm the trial court.\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Riddle was elected on November 4, 2014, defeating incumbent Kim Eaton.\n\nRiddle executed her oath of office on December 29 and began her term on January\n\n1, 2015. Riddle's term in office has been a challenging one.\n\n      Riddle attributes many of the challenges she has faced to Yakima County's\n\nearly adoption of new case management software called Odyssey. Yakima County\n\nhad received approval to be \"an early adopter site\" for Odyssey about a year before\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nRiddle's election, Yakima County Superior Court Local Administrative\n\nRule(LAR)2.1. Odyssey was deemed necessary to replace Yakima's \"obsolete\"\n\ncalendaring software, which posed \"a threat to the [Superior] Court's continuing\n\nability to operate.\" Id. Odyssey was implemented in November 2015, nearly one\n\nyear after Riddle took office. Although most of the early adopter sites for Odyssey\n\nencountered some difficulties in its implementation, the Yakima County Clerk's\n\nOffice had the most difficulty making the transition.\n\n       Another source of difficulty for Riddle has been her ongoing disagreement\n\nwith other Yakima County officials, particularly the superior court judges, about\n\nthe scope of Riddle's powers and duties as clerk. This disagreement prompted the\n\nYakima County Superior Court to pass five new local administrative rules\n\nregarding the powers and duties ofthe clerk on an emergency basis pursuant to GR\n\n7(e). LAR 3, 7, 8, 9, 10. Riddle contends that those rules are void because they\n\nconflict with state law and violate separation-of-powers principles.\n\n       In May 2017, about two and a half years into Riddle's four-year term, the\n\nrecall petitioners (attorneys Rickey Kimbrough, Robert Young,Bruce Smith, and\n\nRichard Johnson)filed a statement of charges against Riddle, Briefly, the charges\n\nallege that Riddle failed to transmit court orders as required by statute, refused to\n\nperform in-court duties and threatened to shut down the Yakima County Superior\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nCourt, and failed to properly collect and account for clerk's office revenue. The\n\nfacts underlying each charge are discussed as relevant to the analysis below.\n\n       As required by ROW 29A.56.130, the Yakima County Prosecuting\n\nAttorney's Office drafted a ballot synopsis based on the charges and petitioned for\n\na ruling on the sufficiency of the charges and the ballot synopsis in Yakima County\n\nSuperior Court. The court ruled that five of the six charges were factually and\n\nlegally sufficient and approved an amended ballot synopsis that states, in full, as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n                              BALLOT SYNOPSIS\n\n\n              The charges that Yakima County Clerk, Janelle Riddle,\n       committed misfeasance, malfeasance and/or violated her oath of\n       office allege she:\n\n              1. Failed, between October 2015 and November 2016,to\n       properly and timely transmit to [the Department of Social and Health\n       Services], Division of Child Support, orders of child support entered\n       in Yakima County Superior Court, resulting in substantial loss of\n       revenue to the County and harm to parents;\n\n              2. Failed, between February 2016 and October 2016 to properly\n       discharge her duty to timely transmit to law enforcement agencies\n       restraining orders entered in Yakima County Superior Court;\n\n             3. Refused and/or failed in July 2016 to perform in-court duties\n       required by law, and threatened to shut down or close the Yakima\n       County Superior Court and Yakima County Clerk's Office;\n\n              4. Failed, between January 2015 and December 2016 to\n       properly maintain account ofthe monies received by the Yakima\n       County Clerk's Office; and\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              5. Failed, between May 2016 and October 2016 to enact\n       procedures to collect for jury services rendered to other courts\n       resulting in a delay of revenue.\n\n              Should Janelle Riddle be recalled from office based on these\n       charges?\n\nClerk's.Papers(CP)at 2442.\n\n       Riddle appealed the sufficiency ofthose five charges to this court pursuant\n\nto RCW 29A.56.270. The insufficient charge is not at issue. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt and hold that all five ofthe remaining charges in the amended ballot synopsis\n\nare factually and legally sufficient and the recall proceeding may move forward.\n\n                                       ISSUES\n\n\n       A.     Are the five remaining charges factually and legally sufficient to\n\nmove forward in accordance with RCW 29A.56.140?\n\n\n       B.     Is the amended ballot synopsis adequate?\n\n              BACKGROUND LAW AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n       Washington voters have a constitutional right to recall any nonjudicial\n\nelected official who \"has committed some act or acts of malfeasance or\n\nmisfeasance while in office, or who has violated his[ or her] oath of office.\"\n\nConst, art. I, § 33. The statutes governing recall proceedings are RCW\n\n29A.56.110-.270. See CONST, art. I, § 34.\n\n       The courts act solely as gatekeepers in the recall process. Our role is \"to\n\nensure that the recall process is not used to harass public officials by subjecting\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nthem to frivolous or unsubstantiated charges.\" In re Recall of West, 155 Wn.2d\n\n659, 662, 121 P.3d 1190(2005). It is up to the voters to determine whether the\n\ncharges are true and, if so, whether they actually justify recalling the official.\n\nCourts therefore take all factual allegations as true. In re Recall ofBoldt, 187\n\nWn.2d 542, 549, 386 P.3d 1104(2017). '\"The sufficiency of a recall petition is\n\nreviewed de novo.'\" Id. (quoting In re Recall ofWasson, 149 Wn.2d 787, 791, 72\n\nP.3d 170 (2003)).\n\n       A charge is factually sufficient where the alleged facts, taken as a whole,\n\n\"'identify' to the electors and to the official being recalled acts or failure to act\n\nwhich without justification would constitute a prima facie showing of misfeasance,\n\nmalfeasance, or a violation of the oath of office.'\" Id. at 548 (quoting Chandler v.\n\nOtto, 103 Wn.2d 268, 274, 693 P.2d 71 (1984)). A charge \"is legally sufficient if\n\nit'state[s] with specificity substantial conduct clearly amounting to misfeasance,\n\nmalfeasance or violation of the oath of office.'\" Id. at 549 (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Chandler, 103 Wn.2d at 274). \"Misfeasance,\" \"malfeasance\" and\n\n\"violation ofthe oath of office\" are statutorily defined:\n\n            (1)\"Misfeasance\" or \"malfeasance\" in office means any\n       wrongful conduct that affects, interrupts, or interferes with the\n       performance of official duty;\n\n            (a) Additionally,\"misfeasance\" in office means the\n       performance of a duty in an improper manner; and\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              (b) Additionally,\"malfeasance\" in office means the\n       commission of an unlawful act;\n\n            (2)\"Violation of the oath of office\" means the neglect or\n       laiowing failure by an elective public officer to perform faithfully a\n       duty imposed by law.\n\nRCW 29A.56.110. When applying these statutory definitions, we have held that\n\n\"[a]n appropriate exercise of discretion does not constitute grounds for recall.\"\n\nBoldt, 187 Wn.2d at 549. Moreover, where the charge alleges the commission of\n\nan unlawful act,\"the petitioner must show facts indicating the official had\n\nknowledge of and intent to commit an unlawful act.\" Id.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n\n       Riddle's contentions reflect a misunderstanding ofthe respective roles ofthe\n\ncourts and the voters in the recall process. We affirm the trial court's ruling that\n\neach charge is factually and legally sufficient to move on to the signature-gathering\n\nphase of the recall proceeding. We decline to address Riddle's challenge to the\n\namended ballot synopsis.\n\nA.     Factual and legal sufficiency of the charges\n\n       Riddle challenges the factual and legal sufficiency of each ofthe five\n\nremaining charges individually, and further raises a general challenge to the recall\n\nproceeding as a whole. We affirm the trial court.\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n       1.     Charge One: failure to transmit child support orders\n\n       Charge One alleges that for over a year, Riddle failed to transmit child\n\nsupport orders entered by the Yakima County Superior Court to the appropriate\n\nagency as required by statute. We affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge One is\n\nfactually and legally sufficient.\n\n              a.     Background information\n\n       Superior court clerks must transmit child support orders to the Division of\n\nChild Support(DCS)\"whhin five days of entry.\" RCW 26.23.033(2).' Ifthe\n\nYakima County Clerk complies with this duty, then DCS funds a portion ofthe\n\nclerk's office budget; if not, then DCS must withhold the anticipated funding. CP\n\nat 1153, 1252, 1281. Charge One alleges that Riddle \"[f]ailed, between October\n\n2015 and November 2016, to properly and timely transmit to [the Department of\n\nSocial and Health Services, DCS], orders of child support entered in Yakima\n\nCounty Superior Court, resulting in, substantial loss of revenue to the County and\n\nharm to parents.\" Id. at 2442.\n\n       DCS first became aware that there was a problem with transmitting support\n\norders in January 2016. The problem dated back to November, when Odyssey was\n\nfirst implemented. On January 11, DCS e-mailed Riddle to notify her that there\n\n\n      'DCS maintains a statewide registry of child support orders to promote uniform\nrecordkeeping and to help custodial parents and their children obtain support payments. RCW\n26.23.010,.033(1).\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nappeared to be a problem and to ask if she knew what was causing it. Id. at 1283.\n\nThe next day, DCS e-mailed again to say it had confirmed that there was a\n\nproblem; it sent a list of cases in which it knew that support orders had not been\n\ntransmitted and asked Riddle to investigate and resolve the issues. Id. at 1289.\n\n       Riddle responded that \"[a]s an 'early adopter' ofthis state courts' program\n\n[Odyssey], we are just to the point of finishing up the workflow process for those\n\ndocuments to automatically be emailed to the designated staff that [the Washington\n\nState Support Registry] would like to receive them.\" Id. at 1283. She assured\n\nDCS that her office was \"working diligently to get this workflow in place,\" and\n\nproposed that in the interim, she could \"ask staff to email them directly\" to DCS.\n\nId.\n\n\n       However, neither the automatic workflow process nor the direct e-mails\n\nfrom staff had resolved the problem by February 3, so DCS e-mailed again,\n\nexpressing its concerns more forcefully:\n\n       While we do understand the difficulties often encountered when\n       switching to a new system, there must be a 'workaround' in place so\n       that you can continue to transmit orders to [the Washington State\n       Support Registry] during this transition period.\n\n             Please let [the supervisor fi-om the intake unit] know the status\n       ofthe automated transmission of orders under the new Odyssey\n       system and also when all ofthe orders NOT previously sent since\n       November 1, 2015 will be transmitted.\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              Also note that the monthly reimbursements you receive from\n       DCS are payment for the transmission of orders and copy requests.\n       Since orders are not being transmitted I will likely need to withhold\n       future reimbursements until all ofthe past orders are received and you\n       are sending orders regularly again.\n\nId. at 1282. DCS's e-mails always included offers to help Riddle resolve the issue.\n\n       In February 2016, the issue also came to the attention ofthe court services\n\ndirector for Yakima County. Id. at 1153. Three people had called her to report\n\nthat they had not received support payments because the support orders in their\n\ncases had not been transmitted to DCS, and the clerk's office had not returned their\n\nrepeated phone calls. Id. at 1153-54. The court services director confirmed that\n\nboth the prosecutor's office and DCS were experiencing similar problems, and she\n\nthen had her staff prepare a report ofthe missing orders. Id. at 1154-55.\n\n       The report stated that only 44.7 percent ofthe child support orders entered in\n\nfamily law cases between November 1, 2015 and February 17, 2016, were ever\n\nreceived by DCS. Id. at 1340. A follow-up report revealed that between February\n\n18 and May 31, 2016,the number of orders transmitted dropped to 33.3 percent.\n\nId. at 1330. By August 2016, 74 percent of orders were transmitted on time, id. at\n\n1125, and as of May 2, 2017, the court services director stated that \"it appears that\n\nthe child support orders are now being sent to [DCS].\" Id. at 1156. However, as a\n\nresult of so many orders being transmitted late or not at all, DCS withheld over\n\n$200,000 in anticipated funding for the clerk's office. Id. at 1154.\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n               b.      Factual sufficiency\n\n       Riddle contends that Charge One is factually insufficient because there is no\n\nevidence that she intended to violate the law. Br. of Appellant at 17. However,\n\nRiddle misreads the intent requirement and the showing necessary to satisfy it.^\n\n       Riddle is correct that in recall proceedings \"[wjhere commission of an\n\nunlawful act is alleged, the petitioner must show facts indicating the official had\n\nknowledge of and intent to commit an unlawful act.\" Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 549\n\n(citing/« re Recall ofTelford, 166 Wn.2d 148, 158, 206 P.3d 1248 (2009)). The\n\nprimary purpose of the intent requirement is to shield elected officials from recall\n\nwhere their actions, though not statutorily compliant, are attributable to a \"simple\n\nmistake.\" In re Recall ofHeiberg, 171 Wn.2d 771, 779, 257 P.3d 565(2011)\n\n(mayor purchased truck under honest but erroneous belief that reserve fund money-\n\ncould be used for that purpose and later reimbursed the town when he learned of\n\nhis mistake).\n\n       The facts in this case, however, allege that Riddle knowingly failed to\n\nperform a statutorily mandated duty in the majority of cases for eight months(from\n\n\n\n        ^ Riddle also contends that Charge One is factually insufficient because it \"fails to\nmention that the problem with forwarding child support orders has been fixed by Ms. Riddle.\"\nBr. of Appellant at 18. However, Charge One provides a start and end date for the period at\nissue, clearly implying that the problem has been resolved. CP at 2442. If Riddle disagrees\nabout the precise date on which the problem was resolved or who should be given credit for\nresolving it, she must take her case to the voters, as we are in no position to resolve that factual\ndispute.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nthe time she was first notified ofthe problem in January 2016 until it was arguably\n\nmostly resolved in August 2016). The facts also allege that other counties that had\n\nbeen early Odyssey adopters faced some challenges, but none ofthem had nearly\n\nas many problems, nor did their problems persist for nearly as long. And in light\n\nof Riddle's refusal to accept suggestions or assistance over this extended period of\n\ntime, a voter might also rationally infer that Riddle acted willfully and with\n\nunreasonable indifference to the consequences of her failure to transmit child\n\nsupport orders. See In re Recall ofSandhaus, 134 Wn.2d 662, 671,953 P.2d 82\n\n(1998)(\"[Wjilfullness can probably be found in evidence showing that Sandhaus\n\nknew he was overspending and did so even after the Board and the auditor warned\n\nhim against doing so.\"). The factual allegations in this case clearly allege much\n\nmore than a simple mistake.\n\n       Riddle, however, contends that the recall petitioners must have evidence that\n\nshe had an unlawful purpose in failing to transmit court orders, such as an intent to\n\ndeprive custodial parents of child support payments. It is true that we have\n\nrequired such evidence where the elected official's actions would have been lawful\n\nbut for the official's alleged unlawful purpose. See Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 551\n\n(charge that officials held a closed meeting for the purpose oftaking action outside\n\nthe view ofthe public in violation ofthe Open Public Meetings Act of 1971,\n\nchapter 42.30 ROW);In re Recall ofCarkeek, 156 Wn.2d 469,472-73, 128 P.3d\n\n\n                                          11\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n1231 (2006)(charge that official filed antiharassment order for the purpose of\n\nkeeping constituents from attending public meetings). In such cases, a showing of\n\nunlawful purpose is necessary to establish an unlawful act constituting\n\nmalfeasance.\n\n\n       This case is different. The factual allegations here, if believed, establish a\n\nprima facie showing of\"the neglect or knowingfailure by an elective public officer\n\nto performfaithfully a duty imposed by law,\" that is, a violation ofthe oath of\n\noffice. RCW 29A.56.110(2)(emphasis added). We therefore hold that Charge\n\nOne is factually sufficient. Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 548.\n\n              c.     Legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle argues that Charge One is not legally sufficient because she did not\n\nengage in any wrongful conduct and the problems with transmitting child support\n\norders were not her fault. We reject these arguments.\n\n       First, relying on the same arguments she raises as to factual sufficiency.\n\nRiddle argues that her extended failure to transmit child support orders was not\n\nwrongful at all. We reject this argument for the reasons stated above in the\n\ndiscussion offactual sufficiency.\n\n       Second, as Riddle correctly notes,\"[a]n appropriate exercise of discretion\n\ndoes not constitute grounds for recall.\" Id. at 549. She is also correct that\n\nbecoming an early adopter of Odyssey was an appropriate exercise of discretion.\n\n\n                                           12\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nwhich she was not involved in. However, Charge One does not seek to recall\n\nRiddle for the early adoption of Odyssey, but for Riddle's knowing failure to\n\nperform faithfully her mandatory duties.\n\n       Riddle may intend to argue that the early adoption of Odyssey made it\n\nimpossible for her to fulfill her duties, which could preclude legal sufficiency. See\n\nGreco v. Parsons, 105 Wn.2d 669, 673, 717 P.2d 1368(1986)(\"Greco's failure to\n\ncomply with an ordinance, because it was impossible to comply, amounts to a\n\nlegally cognizable justification for his failure. Such justification defeats the legal\n\nsufficiency of the recall petition.\"). However, impossibility in this case is, at best,\n\ndisputed.\n\n       Riddle apparently attributes all the problems to Yakima's early adoption of\n\nOdyssey, but the facts alleged by the recall petitioners suggest that other early\n\nadopters had fewer problems, or no problems at all. Compare Br. of Appellant at\n\n21-22, with CP at 1155-56, 1298, 1300, 1302. Moreover, the office manager for\n\nRiddle's predecessor stated that \"[t]he process before Odyssey was to fax all no\n\ncontact/protection orders to a designated law enforcement agency, as stated in the\n\norder. It was to be done immediately after court, so law enforcement could serve\n\nthe paperwork and enter it into their system.\" CP at 2253. There is no indication\n\nRiddle could not have done the same with child support orders until Odyssey was\n\nfunctioning properly. We must take the facts alleged by the recall petitioners as\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\ntrue and assume that the early adoption of Odyssey did not make it impossible for\n\nRiddle to perform her duties.\n\n       Therefore, we affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge One is legally\n\nsufficient, as well as factually sufficient.\n\n       2.     Charge Two: failure to transmit restraining orders\n\n       Charge Two is very similar to Charge One except that Charge Two deals\n\nwith restraining orders instead of child support orders. Riddle's challenges to the\n\nfactual and legal sufficiency of Charge Two are identical to her challenges to\n\nCharge One. Because the allegations underlying each charge are not materially\n\ndifferent, we affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge Two is factually and legally\n\nsufficient.\n\n\n              a.     Background\n\n       The superior court clerk must transmit restraining orders entered in a variety\n\nof cases to law enforcement \"on or before the next judicial day.\" RCW\n\n7.92.180(1)(civil antistalking actions); RCW 10.99.040(6)(pending criminal\n\nactions for domestic violence offenses); RCW 26.09.050(3)(final dissolution\n\ndecrees),.060(8)(pending dissolution actions); RCW 26.26.130(11)(parentage\n\nactions); RCW 26.50.100(1)(domestic violence protection orders). Charge Two\n\nalleges that Riddle \"[fjailed, between February 2016 and October 2016 to properly\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\ndischarge her duty to timely transmit to law enforcement agencies restraining\n\norders entered in Yakima County Superior Court.\" CP at 2442.\n\n       On July 25, 2016,the Yakima County court services director learned that a\n\nfamily member of one of her staff could not get law enforcement assistance in\n\nenforcing valid restraining orders because the orders had not been transmitted to\n\nlaw enforcement. Hoping that this was an isolated incident, the court services\n\ndirector ordered reports about missing restraining orders. The reports revealed that\n\nbetween June 1 and July 27, 2016, 40 percent of criminal no-contact orders were\n\nnot received by law enforcement. Id. at 1731. Between June 1 and July 21, 2016,\n\n71 percent of domestic restraining orders were not received. Id. at 1735. A\n\nfollow-up report spanning January through August 2016 revealed a pattern of\n\nfailure to transmit restraining orders. Id. at 1159-60, 1788.\n\n       When the court services director sent these reports to Riddle and asked if\n\nthey could meet to discuss and sort out the problem. Riddle responded that her\n\noffice was running its own reports and did not need assistance. Id. at 1736, 1738.\n\nAlthough the time period referenced in Charge Two ends in October 2016,the\n\nproblem was not in fact fully resolved by then. M at 1751-55. We do not know\n\nwhat happened after October 2016.\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 947.88-1\n\n\n               b.     Factual and legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle argues that there is no evidence that she intended to violate the law,\n\nthat she did not engage in any substantial misconduct, and that the problems were\n\ncaused by Yakima's early adoption of Odyssey. She does not distinguish the\n\narguments pertaining to Charge Two from those pertaining to Charge One. We\n\ntherefore reject those arguments for the reasons discussed in the above analysis of\n\nCharge One and affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge Two is sufficient.\n\n       3.      Charge Three: refusal to perform in-court duties\n\n       There have been significant tensions between Riddle and the Yakima\n\nCounty Superior Court over their respective powers and duties. Charge Three\n\nalleges that Riddle \"[rjefused and/or failed in July 2016 to perform in-court duties\n\nrequired by law, and threatened to shut down or close the Yakima County Superior\n\nCourt and Yakima County Clerk's Office.\" Id. at 2442. We affirm the trial court's\n\nruling that this charge is factually and legally sufficient,\n\n               a.     Background\n\n       Riddle came into the position of clerk with very different ideas about her\n\npowers and duties than those held by the Yakima County Superior Court and the\n\nBoard of Yakima County Commissioners. Riddle felt it was inappropriate for her\n\ndeputy clerks to perform in-court tasks they had done in the past, such as operating\n\nthe electronic recording equipment that had replaced most ofthe in-person court\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nreporters in Yakima and providing copies ofthose recordings as requested. The\nclerk's office had been providing such services to the Yakima County Superior\n\nCourt for years in exchange for extra staff and additional funding for the clerk's\n\noffice, while the staff and budget for the court were reduced accordingly. Id. at\n\n1177-78.\n\n\n       Although Riddle agreed before she took office that she would continue that\n\narrangement, after taking her oath of office she stated her intent to withdraw from\n\nit. E.g., id. at 1168. After a tense meeting between Riddle and the superior court\n\njudges on March 30, 2015, the Yakima County Superior Court adopted LAR 3,\n\nwhich \"describes actual current courtroom procedures and the responsibilities of\n\nthe Clerk of the Court while in court. The purpose ofthe rule is to maintain and\n\ncontinue current practice without interruption.\" LAR 3 was adopted on an\n\nemergency basis effective April 15, 2015, and on a permanent basis effective\n\nSeptember 1, 2015. However, despite the passage ofLAR 3, Riddle again asserted\n\nthat her deputy clerks would stop providing the in-court services specified in the\n\nrule. E.g., id. at 1223.\n\n       The court services director became sufficiently concerned about Riddle's\n\nassertions, and she brought the issue to the Yakima County Law and Justice\n\nCommittee, which caused the Board of Yakima County Commissioners to appoint\n\nan independent review panel in March 2016. The panel's initial report, issued on\n\n\n                                          17\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nMay 31, 2016, noted an attorney general opinion suggesting that the remedy for a\n\nclerk who refuses to follow a local court rule may be contempt proceedings.\n\n       On July 3, 2016, Riddle responded to the panel's report with a written\n\ndocument that opened,\"Dear Family, Friends and Supporters.\"^ M at 2113. As\n\nrelevant to Charge Three, Riddle's document included the following language:\n\n             I have been threatened with contempt and going to jail if I don't\n       do what the County Commissioners and Court want me to do.\n       Therefore, I have no choice other than to prepare for this possibility\n       by sending a Clerk's Directive to the Prosecuting Attorney. I don't\n       believe they realize what the severity ofthe consequences will be. I\n       would have no choice other than to revoke the deputization[ ]of all my\n       deputies (staff) and they would not be able to perform my duties in\n       my absence which would close the Clerk's Office. The Courts will\n       not be able to hear cases without a Clerk present so the Courts will\n       shut down. The jail will be overflowing because the Prosecutor will\n       have no way to prosecute individuals. I would hope they know these\n       consequences and will choose not to shut down our judicial system by\n       such an action. I would be given no choice as I must ensure my\n       mandated responsibilities are being met according to the law.\n\nId. at 2117. The disputes leading up to this document and the document itself are\n\nthe basis for Charge Three.\n\n              b.     Factual sufficiency\n\n       First, Riddle contends that Charge Three is factually insufficient because\n\nthere is no proofthat she actually \"failed\" to perform any in-court duties.\n\nHowever, Charge Three alleges that she \"[rjeflised and/or failed\" to perform those\n\n\n       ^ The document is dated \"July 3, 2015,\" but the parties agree that the document was\nactually written in 2016. CP at 2113.\n\n\n                                              18\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nduties. Id. at 2442(emphasis added). The facts clearly allege that Riddle refused\n\nto perform in-court duties and thus that Riddle refused and/or failed to perform\n\nthose duties,just as Charge Three states.\n\n       Next, Riddle argues that there is no proofthat she actually shut down the\n\ncourt as threatened. That is true, but irrelevant. Where an official credibly\n\nthreatens retaliation in his or her official capacity,\"such threats alone would be ...\n\nwrongful by any standard.\" In re Recall ofLee, 122 Wn.2d 613, 619, 859 P.2d\n\n1244(1993). For instance, we held sufficient a charge that a mayor threatened to\n\nhave local law enforcement officers fired if they issued her a traffic citation. Id.\n\nLike Riddle in this case, the mayor in that case argued the charge was \"inadequate\n\nbecause it does not allege that any police officer ever refrained from issuing her a\n\ncitation because of what she said.\" Id. at 618-19.\n\n\n       We rejected that argument and held that \"[ejven if no officer ever refrained\n\nfrom issuing Mayor Lee a citation out of fear for his job,such threats alone would\n\nbe a clear abuse of the mayor's position of authority over the police department\n\nand would be wrongful by any standard.'\"^ Id. at 619(emphasis added). To the\n\nextent Riddle argues that the document at issue in this case was not a threat but a\n\n\n\n\n        Riddle attempts to distinguish this case on the basis that in Lee,\"the mayor's threat was\ncoupled with an action: a directive to subordinates to never issue her a ticket.\" Reply Br. of\nAppellant at 9. However, the decision in Lee was explicitly based on the threat alone, not a\nthreat coupled with an action.\n\n\n                                               19\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nmere expression of opinion regarding a hypothetical scenario, a reasonable person\n\nreading the language Riddle actually used might well reach a different conclusion.\n\n       Finally, Riddle argues that the alleged threat to shut down the court cannot\n\nbe factually sufficient because it was in a letter \"addressed to Ms. Riddle's\n\nsupporters, family and friends,\" not to the court. Br. of Appellant at 27.\n\nHowever,this letter was delivered to the Board of Yakima County Commissioners\n\nat one of its meetings. CP at 2036. Regardless ofthe opening salutation, the facts\n\nclearly allege that Riddle did not intend for this document to be a private\n\nexpression of opinion but a publicly directed statement of her intentions.\n\n       We affirm that Charge Three is factually sufficient.\n\n              c.     Legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle contends Charge Three is not legally sufficient because she had no\n\nobligation to perform in-court duties, and therefore she had a legally justifiable\n\nexcuse for refusing to perform them. She also argues that Charge Three cannot be\n\nlegally sufficient because she was exercising her First Amendment rights. U.S.\n\nConst, amend I. Riddle misapprehends the scope of her powers, her duties, and\n\nthe First Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n       First, Riddle contends that LAR 3 was enacted without authority oflaw and\n\nis therefore void, so she was justified in refusing to follow it.^ An action with a\n\nlegally justifiable excuse is not sufficient for recall, but Riddle's position is not\n\nlegally justifiable.\n\n       While Riddle is correct that she retains authority over the clerk's office, she\n\nfails to recognize that she is,\"by virtue of[her] office, clerk of the superior court.\"\n\nConst, art. IV, § 26. As we have explained,\n\n       [t]he duties of a county clerk as clerk of the superior court are defined\n       both by statute and court rules. Generally speaking, a clerk of court is\n       an officer of a court ofjustice, who attends to the clerical portion of\n       its business, and who has custody of its records and files and of its\n       seal. Such an office is essentially ministerial in its nature, and the\n       clerk is neither the court nor a judicial officer.\n\nSwanson v. Olympic Peninsula Motor Coach Co., 190 Wash. 35, 38,66 P.2d 842\n\n(1937)(emphasis added). The superior court \"has power ...[t]o control, in\n\nfurtherance ofjustice, the conduct of its ministerial officers,\" such as county\n\nclerks. RCW 2.28.010(5). Therefore, when acting as the clerk ofthe superior\n\ncourt, the county clerk has always been required \"[i]n the performance of his or her\n\nduties to conform to the direction ofthe court.\" RCW 2.32.050(9); see Laws OF\n\n1891, ch. 57, § 3(9). The clerk's general powers and duties as clerk ofthe superior\n\n\n\n\n        ^ Riddle also argues that her initial agreement to provide in-court services is without force\nbecause she entered the agreement prior to taking office. This is irrelevant because the charge is\nthat she refused to perform duties required by law—^that is, by statute and court rule.\n\n                                                 21\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\ncourt are set forth in RCW 2.32.050 and, for Yakima County specifically, LAR 3\n\nand 7 through 10.\n\n       Riddle contends that LAR 3, which addresses in-court duties, is void\n\nbecause the court has no authority to \"dictate the personnel functions of a different\n\nCounty department.\" Br. of Appellant at 28. However, as the preceding paragraph\n\nexplains, a court does have the authority to direct the functions of the clerk when\n\nhe or she is acting in his or her capacity as clerk ofthe superior court. Cf. SAR\n\n16(f)(powers and duties of the Clerk of the Supreme Court). Moreover, the\n\nattorney general has opined that a court's rule-making authority in regard to court\n\nclerks is subject to the same restrictions as any other rules: \"[T]o the extent that the\n\ncourt rule relates to practice and procedure rather than to the creation of\n\nsubstantive law, the rule is within the authority of the court.\" 2001 Op. Att'y Gen.\n\nNo. 6, at 3. LAR 3 is within the scope ofthe court's rule-making authority, and\n\nRiddle has no legally justifiable excuse for refusing to follow it.\n\n       Second, Riddle contends that her alleged threat to shut down the court was\n\nan expression of opinion protected by the First Amendment and that such protected\n\nexpression cannot be grounds for recall. Riddle appears to be unaware that the\n\nFirst Amendment prevents governments from restricting or chilling free speech.\n\n16A Am.Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 400(2008). A recall proceeding is an\n\naction by the voters, not the government. CONST, art. I, § 33. The voters\n\n\n                                           22\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nunquestionably have a right to base their decisions on what a public official says,\n\nthe First Amendment notwithstanding.\n\n       While Riddle cites authorities, they do not support her position. One ofthe\n\ncases cited, which does not deal with recall, holds that \"[t]o be sure, the First\n\nAmendment protects [the plaintiff]'s discordant speech as a general matter; it does\n\nnot, however, immunize him from the political fallout of what he says.\" Blair v.\n\nBethel Sch. Dist., 608 F.3d 540, 542(9th Cir. 2010), cited in Br. of Appellant at 33.\n\nAnother, which also does not deal with recall, notes that \"[ojur case law recognizes\n\nthat the nature of political debate is rough and tumble.\" Eaton v. Meneley, 379\n\nF.3d 949, 956(10th Cir. 2004), cited in Br. of Appellant at 33. And the only case\n\nRiddle cites that does involve a recall proceeding dealt with very different\n\nquestions about a charge that the official committed perjury and false swearing. In\n\nre Recall ofPearsall-Stipek, 141 Wn.2d 756, 10 P.3d 1034(2000), cited in Br. of\n\nAppellant at 34. The court was required to determine whether the elements of\n\nthose crimes were properly alleged by the facts underlying the charge. It did not\n\nengage in any discussion of free speech principles.\n\n       Because Riddle's contentions do not have merit, we affirm the trial court's\n\nruling that Charge Three is factually and legally sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n       4.     Charge Four: failure to account\n\n       Charge Four states that Riddle \"[f]ailed, between January 2015 and\n\nDecember 2016 to properly maintain account ofthe monies received by the\n\nYakima County Clerk's Office.\" CP at 2442. We affirm the trial court's ruling\n\nthat Charge Four is factually and legally sufficient,\n\n              a.     Background\n\n       The Washington State auditor performed a scheduled audit ofthe Yakima\n\nCounty Clerk's Office covering the year from January 1 to December 31, 2015.\n\nThe audit determined that stronger internal controls and oversight were needed,\n\nnoting, among other problems, that several important tasks were not completed\n\nuntil long after they were due and the clerk's office had failed to maintain proper\n\ndocumentation needed for an outsider to verify that collections had been performed\n\ncorrectly.\n\n       The audit noted that similar concerns had been raised in two prior audits, but\n\napparently had not been fixed. The cause of the problems, according to the audit\n\nreport, was that \"[t]he Clerk's Office has not devoted sufficient time and resources\n\nto ensure proper segregation of duties exists over cash handling and account\n\nreconciliations and has not taken the necessary steps to correct reconciliation items\n\nnoted in the previous audit.\" Id. at 2131.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n               b.    Factual and legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle's contentions regarding the sufficiency of Charge Four are\n\nindistinguishable from those she raises in regard to Charges One and Two. We\n\nreject these arguments in accordance with the analysis ofthe factual and legal\n\nsufficiency of Charge One, above, and affirm the sufficiency of Charge Four.\n\n       5.      Charge Five; failure to collect jury service fees\n\n       Charge Five alleges that Riddle \"[fjailed, between May 2016 and October\n\n2016 to enact procedures to collect for jury services rendered to other courts\n\nresulting in a delay of revenue.\" Id. at 2442.\n\n               a.    Background\n\n       In addition to the Yakima Counly Superior Court, the Yakima County\n\nClerk's Office provides jury services for one district court and three municipal\n\ncourts. The clerk's office is supposed to bill those courts for jury services once a\n\nmonth. However,the Washington State Auditor's Office determined that\n\n       [t]he Clerk has not established procedures to ensure the Office is paid\n       for these services. The Office has not billed or collected for jury\n       services provided to the District Court and two municipal courts from\n       May 2015 through August 2016. We estimate these services to be\n       approximately $44,500. In addition, the Clerk provided jury services\n       for one municipal court without an agreement in place from May 2015\n       to September 2016. The agreement was subsequently signed and\n       billed in October 2016 for $52,411, sixteen months after the service\n       period started.\n\nId. at 2130.\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              b.     Factual and legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle's contentions regarding the sufficiency of Charge Five are\n\nindistinguishable from those She raises in regard to Charges One, Two, and Four.\n\nWe reject these arguments in accordance with the analysis ofthe factual and legal\n\nsufficiency of Charge One, above, and affirm the sufficiency of Charge Five.\n\n       6.     Challenge based on the timing of the next general election\n\n       Finally, Riddle briefly notes that she will be up for election soon anyway,\n\nimplying that the recall proceeding is therefore unnecessary. Certainly the recall\n\npetitioners, if unsuccessful, may take solace in the fact that Riddle is up for\n\nreelection soon, but\"we do not suggest that the imminence of a regular election\n\njustifies dismissing a recall petition.\" Sandhaus, 134 Wn.2d at 672. The timing of\n\nthe next election is irrelevant to our analysis.\n\nB.     Ballot Synopsis\n\n       Finally, Riddle challenges the adequacy of the ballot synopsis for its failure\n\nto identify which charges are malfeasance, which are misfeasance, and which are\n\nviolations ofthe oath of office. We decline to review this issue because \"[t]he\n\ndecision ofthe superior court concerning the adequacy ofthe ballot synopsis is\n\n'final.'\" In re Recall ofZufelt, 112 Wn.2d 906, 910, 774 P.2d 1223 (1989); see\n\nRCW 29A.56.140.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\n       We affirm the trial court's ruling that the five remaining recall charges\n\nagainst Riddle are factually and legally sufficient, and the recall proceeding may\n\nmove forward to the signature-gathering phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1 ,\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n-Hu                  ^ (L                          r*\n\n\n\n\n                           'V\n\n\n\n\n        1'\n\n                                            ,7/t: e2.\n\n\n\n\n                                       28\n\f",

Filed:         OCT 2 6 2M?\n\n      YU, J. — Yakima County Clerk Janelle Riddle appeals the trial court's\n\nruling that five out of the six recall charges filed against her are factually and\n\nlegally sufficient. We granted the recall petitioners' motion for accelerated review\n\nand now affirm the trial court.\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Riddle was elected on November 4, 2014, defeating incumbent Kim Eaton.\n\nRiddle executed her oath of office on December 29 and began her term on January\n\n1, 2015. Riddle's term in office has been a challenging one.\n\n      Riddle attributes many of the challenges she has faced to Yakima County's\n\nearly adoption of new case management software called Odyssey. Yakima County\n\nhad received approval to be \"an early adopter site\" for Odyssey about a year before\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nRiddle's election, Yakima County Superior Court Local Administrative\n\nRule(LAR)2.1. Odyssey was deemed necessary to replace Yakima's \"obsolete\"\n\ncalendaring software, which posed \"a threat to the [Superior] Court's continuing\n\nability to operate.\" Id. Odyssey was implemented in November 2015, nearly one\n\nyear after Riddle took office. Although most of the early adopter sites for Odyssey\n\nencountered some difficulties in its implementation, the Yakima County Clerk's\n\nOffice had the most difficulty making the transition.\n\n       Another source of difficulty for Riddle has been her ongoing disagreement\n\nwith other Yakima County officials, particularly the superior court judges, about\n\nthe scope of Riddle's powers and duties as clerk. This disagreement prompted the\n\nYakima County Superior Court to pass five new local administrative rules\n\nregarding the powers and duties ofthe clerk on an emergency basis pursuant to GR\n\n7(e). LAR 3, 7, 8, 9, 10. Riddle contends that those rules are void because they\n\nconflict with state law and violate separation-of-powers principles.\n\n       In May 2017, about two and a half years into Riddle's four-year term, the\n\nrecall petitioners (attorneys Rickey Kimbrough, Robert Young,Bruce Smith, and\n\nRichard Johnson)filed a statement of charges against Riddle, Briefly, the charges\n\nallege that Riddle failed to transmit court orders as required by statute, refused to\n\nperform in-court duties and threatened to shut down the Yakima County Superior\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nCourt, and failed to properly collect and account for clerk's office revenue. The\n\nfacts underlying each charge are discussed as relevant to the analysis below.\n\n       As required by ROW 29A.56.130, the Yakima County Prosecuting\n\nAttorney's Office drafted a ballot synopsis based on the charges and petitioned for\n\na ruling on the sufficiency of the charges and the ballot synopsis in Yakima County\n\nSuperior Court. The court ruled that five of the six charges were factually and\n\nlegally sufficient and approved an amended ballot synopsis that states, in full, as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n                              BALLOT SYNOPSIS\n\n\n              The charges that Yakima County Clerk, Janelle Riddle,\n       committed misfeasance, malfeasance and/or violated her oath of\n       office allege she:\n\n              1. Failed, between October 2015 and November 2016,to\n       properly and timely transmit to [the Department of Social and Health\n       Services], Division of Child Support, orders of child support entered\n       in Yakima County Superior Court, resulting in substantial loss of\n       revenue to the County and harm to parents;\n\n              2. Failed, between February 2016 and October 2016 to properly\n       discharge her duty to timely transmit to law enforcement agencies\n       restraining orders entered in Yakima County Superior Court;\n\n             3. Refused and/or failed in July 2016 to perform in-court duties\n       required by law, and threatened to shut down or close the Yakima\n       County Superior Court and Yakima County Clerk's Office;\n\n              4. Failed, between January 2015 and December 2016 to\n       properly maintain account ofthe monies received by the Yakima\n       County Clerk's Office; and\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              5. Failed, between May 2016 and October 2016 to enact\n       procedures to collect for jury services rendered to other courts\n       resulting in a delay of revenue.\n\n              Should Janelle Riddle be recalled from office based on these\n       charges?\n\nClerk's.Papers(CP)at 2442.\n\n       Riddle appealed the sufficiency ofthose five charges to this court pursuant\n\nto RCW 29A.56.270. The insufficient charge is not at issue. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt and hold that all five ofthe remaining charges in the amended ballot synopsis\n\nare factually and legally sufficient and the recall proceeding may move forward.\n\n                                       ISSUES\n\n\n       A.     Are the five remaining charges factually and legally sufficient to\n\nmove forward in accordance with RCW 29A.56.140?\n\n\n       B.     Is the amended ballot synopsis adequate?\n\n              BACKGROUND LAW AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n       Washington voters have a constitutional right to recall any nonjudicial\n\nelected official who \"has committed some act or acts of malfeasance or\n\nmisfeasance while in office, or who has violated his[ or her] oath of office.\"\n\nConst, art. I, § 33. The statutes governing recall proceedings are RCW\n\n29A.56.110-.270. See CONST, art. I, § 34.\n\n       The courts act solely as gatekeepers in the recall process. Our role is \"to\n\nensure that the recall process is not used to harass public officials by subjecting\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nthem to frivolous or unsubstantiated charges.\" In re Recall of West, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">659</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 662, 121 P.3d 1190(2005).

When applying these statutory definitions, we have held that\n\n\"[a]n appropriate exercise of discretion does not constitute grounds for recall.\"\n\nBoldt, 187 Wn.2d at 549. Moreover, where the charge alleges the commission of\n\nan unlawful act,\"the petitioner must show facts indicating the official had\n\nknowledge of and intent to commit an unlawful act.\" Id.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n\n       Riddle's contentions reflect a misunderstanding ofthe respective roles ofthe\n\ncourts and the voters in the recall process. We affirm the trial court's ruling that\n\neach charge is factually and legally sufficient to move on to the signature-gathering\n\nphase of the recall proceeding. We decline to address Riddle's challenge to the\n\namended ballot synopsis.\n\nA.     Factual and legal sufficiency of the charges\n\n       Riddle challenges the factual and legal sufficiency of each ofthe five\n\nremaining charges individually, and further raises a general challenge to the recall\n\nproceeding as a whole. We affirm the trial court.\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n       1.     Charge One: failure to transmit child support orders\n\n       Charge One alleges that for over a year, Riddle failed to transmit child\n\nsupport orders entered by the Yakima County Superior Court to the appropriate\n\nagency as required by statute. We affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge One is\n\nfactually and legally sufficient.\n\n              a.     Background information\n\n       Superior court clerks must transmit child support orders to the Division of\n\nChild Support(DCS)\"whhin five days of entry.\" RCW 26.23.033(2).' Ifthe\n\nYakima County Clerk complies with this duty, then DCS funds a portion ofthe\n\nclerk's office budget; if not, then DCS must withhold the anticipated funding. CP\n\nat 1153, 1252, 1281. Charge One alleges that Riddle \"[f]ailed, between October\n\n2015 and November 2016, to properly and timely transmit to [the Department of\n\nSocial and Health Services, DCS], orders of child support entered in Yakima\n\nCounty Superior Court, resulting in, substantial loss of revenue to the County and\n\nharm to parents.\" Id. at 2442.\n\n       DCS first became aware that there was a problem with transmitting support\n\norders in January 2016. The problem dated back to November, when Odyssey was\n\nfirst implemented. On January 11, DCS e-mailed Riddle to notify her that there\n\n\n      'DCS maintains a statewide registry of child support orders to promote uniform\nrecordkeeping and to help custodial parents and their children obtain support payments. RCW\n26.23.010,.033(1).\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nappeared to be a problem and to ask if she knew what was causing it. Id. at 1283.\n\nThe next day, DCS e-mailed again to say it had confirmed that there was a\n\nproblem; it sent a list of cases in which it knew that support orders had not been\n\ntransmitted and asked Riddle to investigate and resolve the issues. Id. at 1289.\n\n       Riddle responded that \"[a]s an 'early adopter' ofthis state courts' program\n\n[Odyssey], we are just to the point of finishing up the workflow process for those\n\ndocuments to automatically be emailed to the designated staff that [the Washington\n\nState Support Registry] would like to receive them.\" Id. at 1283. She assured\n\nDCS that her office was \"working diligently to get this workflow in place,\" and\n\nproposed that in the interim, she could \"ask staff to email them directly\" to DCS.\n\nId.\n\n\n       However, neither the automatic workflow process nor the direct e-mails\n\nfrom staff had resolved the problem by February 3, so DCS e-mailed again,\n\nexpressing its concerns more forcefully:\n\n       While we do understand the difficulties often encountered when\n       switching to a new system, there must be a 'workaround' in place so\n       that you can continue to transmit orders to [the Washington State\n       Support Registry] during this transition period.\n\n             Please let [the supervisor fi-om the intake unit] know the status\n       ofthe automated transmission of orders under the new Odyssey\n       system and also when all ofthe orders NOT previously sent since\n       November 1, 2015 will be transmitted.\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              Also note that the monthly reimbursements you receive from\n       DCS are payment for the transmission of orders and copy requests.\n       Since orders are not being transmitted I will likely need to withhold\n       future reimbursements until all ofthe past orders are received and you\n       are sending orders regularly again.\n\nId. at 1282. DCS's e-mails always included offers to help Riddle resolve the issue.\n\n       In February 2016, the issue also came to the attention ofthe court services\n\ndirector for Yakima County. Id. at 1153. Three people had called her to report\n\nthat they had not received support payments because the support orders in their\n\ncases had not been transmitted to DCS, and the clerk's office had not returned their\n\nrepeated phone calls. Id. at 1153-54. The court services director confirmed that\n\nboth the prosecutor's office and DCS were experiencing similar problems, and she\n\nthen had her staff prepare a report ofthe missing orders. Id. at 1154-55.\n\n       The report stated that only 44.7 percent ofthe child support orders entered in\n\nfamily law cases between November 1, 2015 and February 17, 2016, were ever\n\nreceived by DCS. Id. at 1340. A follow-up report revealed that between February\n\n18 and May 31, 2016,the number of orders transmitted dropped to 33.3 percent.\n\nId. at 1330. By August 2016, 74 percent of orders were transmitted on time, id. at\n\n1125, and as of May 2, 2017, the court services director stated that \"it appears that\n\nthe child support orders are now being sent to [DCS].\" Id. at 1156. However, as a\n\nresult of so many orders being transmitted late or not at all, DCS withheld over\n\n$200,000 in anticipated funding for the clerk's office. Id. at 1154.\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n               b.      Factual sufficiency\n\n       Riddle contends that Charge One is factually insufficient because there is no\n\nevidence that she intended to violate the law. Br. of Appellant at 17. However,\n\nRiddle misreads the intent requirement and the showing necessary to satisfy it.^\n\n       Riddle is correct that in recall proceedings \"[wjhere commission of an\n\nunlawful act is alleged, the petitioner must show facts indicating the official had\n\nknowledge of and intent to commit an unlawful act.\" Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 549\n\n(citing/« re Recall ofTelford, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2627824\"><a href=\"/opinion/2627824/in-re-recall-of-telford/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009)). The\n\nprimary purpose of the intent requirement is to shield elected officials from recall\n\nwhere their actions, though not statutorily compliant, are attributable to a \"simple\n\nmistake.\" In re Recall ofHeiberg, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 779, 257 P.3d 565(2011)\n\n(mayor purchased truck under honest but erroneous belief that reserve fund money-\n\ncould be used for that purpose and later reimbursed the town when he learned of\n\nhis mistake).\n\n       The facts in this case, however, allege that Riddle knowingly failed to\n\nperform a statutorily mandated duty in the majority of cases for eight months(from\n\n\n\n        ^ Riddle also contends that Charge One is factually insufficient because it \"fails to\nmention that the problem with forwarding child support orders has been fixed by Ms. Riddle.\"\nBr. of Appellant at 18. However, Charge One provides a start and end date for the period at\nissue, clearly implying that the problem has been resolved. CP at 2442. If Riddle disagrees\nabout the precise date on which the problem was resolved or who should be given credit for\nresolving it, she must take her case to the voters, as we are in no position to resolve that factual\ndispute.\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nthe time she was first notified ofthe problem in January 2016 until it was arguably\n\nmostly resolved in August 2016). The facts also allege that other counties that had\n\nbeen early Odyssey adopters faced some challenges, but none ofthem had nearly\n\nas many problems, nor did their problems persist for nearly as long. And in light\n\nof Riddle's refusal to accept suggestions or assistance over this extended period of\n\ntime, a voter might also rationally infer that Riddle acted willfully and with\n\nunreasonable indifference to the consequences of her failure to transmit child\n\nsupport orders. See In re Recall ofSandhaus, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671,953 P.2d 82\n\n(1998)(\"[Wjilfullness can probably be found in evidence showing that Sandhaus\n\nknew he was overspending and did so even after the Board and the auditor warned\n\nhim against doing so.\"). The factual allegations in this case clearly allege much\n\nmore than a simple mistake.\n\n       Riddle, however, contends that the recall petitioners must have evidence that\n\nshe had an unlawful purpose in failing to transmit court orders, such as an intent to\n\ndeprive custodial parents of child support payments. It is true that we have\n\nrequired such evidence where the elected official's actions would have been lawful\n\nbut for the official's alleged unlawful purpose. See Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 551\n\n(charge that officials held a closed meeting for the purpose oftaking action outside\n\nthe view ofthe public in violation ofthe Open Public Meetings Act of 1971,\n\nchapter 42.30 ROW);In re Recall ofCarkeek, 156 Wn.2d 469,472-73, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n\n\n                                          <span class=\"page\">11</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n1231 (2006)(charge that official filed antiharassment order for the purpose of\n\nkeeping constituents from attending public meetings). In such cases, a showing of\n\nunlawful purpose is necessary to establish an unlawful act constituting\n\nmalfeasance.\n\n\n       This case is different. The factual allegations here, if believed, establish a\n\nprima facie showing of\"the neglect or knowingfailure by an elective public officer\n\nto performfaithfully a duty imposed by law,\" that is, a violation ofthe oath of\n\noffice. RCW 29A.56.110(2)(emphasis added). We therefore hold that Charge\n\nOne is factually sufficient. Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 548.\n\n              c.     Legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle argues that Charge One is not legally sufficient because she did not\n\nengage in any wrongful conduct and the problems with transmitting child support\n\norders were not her fault. We reject these arguments.\n\n       First, relying on the same arguments she raises as to factual sufficiency.\n\nRiddle argues that her extended failure to transmit child support orders was not\n\nwrongful at all. We reject this argument for the reasons stated above in the\n\ndiscussion offactual sufficiency.\n\n       Second, as Riddle correctly notes,\"[a]n appropriate exercise of discretion\n\ndoes not constitute grounds for recall.\" Id. at 549. She is also correct that\n\nbecoming an early adopter of Odyssey was an appropriate exercise of discretion.\n\n\n                                           12\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nwhich she was not involved in. However, Charge One does not seek to recall\n\nRiddle for the early adoption of Odyssey, but for Riddle's knowing failure to\n\nperform faithfully her mandatory duties.\n\n       Riddle may intend to argue that the early adoption of Odyssey made it\n\nimpossible for her to fulfill her duties, which could preclude legal sufficiency. See\n\nGreco v. Parsons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1280249\"><a href=\"/opinion/1280249/greco-v-parsons/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673, 717 P.2d 1368(1986)(\"Greco's failure to\n\ncomply with an ordinance, because it was impossible to comply, amounts to a\n\nlegally cognizable justification for his failure. Such justification defeats the legal\n\nsufficiency of the recall petition.\"). However, impossibility in this case is, at best,\n\ndisputed.\n\n       Riddle apparently attributes all the problems to Yakima's early adoption of\n\nOdyssey, but the facts alleged by the recall petitioners suggest that other early\n\nadopters had fewer problems, or no problems at all. Compare Br. of Appellant at\n\n21-22, with CP at 1155-56, 1298, 1300, 1302. Moreover, the office manager for\n\nRiddle's predecessor stated that \"[t]he process before Odyssey was to fax all no\n\ncontact/protection orders to a designated law enforcement agency, as stated in the\n\norder. It was to be done immediately after court, so law enforcement could serve\n\nthe paperwork and enter it into their system.\" CP at 2253. There is no indication\n\nRiddle could not have done the same with child support orders until Odyssey was\n\nfunctioning properly. We must take the facts alleged by the recall petitioners as\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\ntrue and assume that the early adoption of Odyssey did not make it impossible for\n\nRiddle to perform her duties.\n\n       Therefore, we affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge One is legally\n\nsufficient, as well as factually sufficient.\n\n       2.     Charge Two: failure to transmit restraining orders\n\n       Charge Two is very similar to Charge One except that Charge Two deals\n\nwith restraining orders instead of child support orders. Riddle's challenges to the\n\nfactual and legal sufficiency of Charge Two are identical to her challenges to\n\nCharge One. Because the allegations underlying each charge are not materially\n\ndifferent, we affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge Two is factually and legally\n\nsufficient.\n\n\n              a.     Background\n\n       The superior court clerk must transmit restraining orders entered in a variety\n\nof cases to law enforcement \"on or before the next judicial day.\" RCW\n\n7.92.180(1)(civil antistalking actions); RCW 10.99.040(6)(pending criminal\n\nactions for domestic violence offenses); RCW 26.09.050(3)(final dissolution\n\ndecrees),.060(8)(pending dissolution actions); RCW 26.26.130(11)(parentage\n\nactions); RCW 26.50.100(1)(domestic violence protection orders). Charge Two\n\nalleges that Riddle \"[fjailed, between February 2016 and October 2016 to properly\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\ndischarge her duty to timely transmit to law enforcement agencies restraining\n\norders entered in Yakima County Superior Court.\" CP at 2442.\n\n       On July 25, 2016,the Yakima County court services director learned that a\n\nfamily member of one of her staff could not get law enforcement assistance in\n\nenforcing valid restraining orders because the orders had not been transmitted to\n\nlaw enforcement. Hoping that this was an isolated incident, the court services\n\ndirector ordered reports about missing restraining orders. The reports revealed that\n\nbetween June 1 and July 27, 2016, 40 percent of criminal no-contact orders were\n\nnot received by law enforcement. Id. at 1731. Between June 1 and July 21, 2016,\n\n71 percent of domestic restraining orders were not received. Id. at 1735. A\n\nfollow-up report spanning January through August 2016 revealed a pattern of\n\nfailure to transmit restraining orders. Id. at 1159-60, 1788.\n\n       When the court services director sent these reports to Riddle and asked if\n\nthey could meet to discuss and sort out the problem. Riddle responded that her\n\noffice was running its own reports and did not need assistance. Id. at 1736, 1738.\n\nAlthough the time period referenced in Charge Two ends in October 2016,the\n\nproblem was not in fact fully resolved by then. M at 1751-55. We do not know\n\nwhat happened after October 2016.\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 947.88-1\n\n\n               b.     Factual and legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle argues that there is no evidence that she intended to violate the law,\n\nthat she did not engage in any substantial misconduct, and that the problems were\n\ncaused by Yakima's early adoption of Odyssey. She does not distinguish the\n\narguments pertaining to Charge Two from those pertaining to Charge One. We\n\ntherefore reject those arguments for the reasons discussed in the above analysis of\n\nCharge One and affirm the trial court's ruling that Charge Two is sufficient.\n\n       3.      Charge Three: refusal to perform in-court duties\n\n       There have been significant tensions between Riddle and the Yakima\n\nCounty Superior Court over their respective powers and duties. Charge Three\n\nalleges that Riddle \"[rjefused and/or failed in July 2016 to perform in-court duties\n\nrequired by law, and threatened to shut down or close the Yakima County Superior\n\nCourt and Yakima County Clerk's Office.\" Id. at 2442. We affirm the trial court's\n\nruling that this charge is factually and legally sufficient,\n\n               a.     Background\n\n       Riddle came into the position of clerk with very different ideas about her\n\npowers and duties than those held by the Yakima County Superior Court and the\n\nBoard of Yakima County Commissioners. Riddle felt it was inappropriate for her\n\ndeputy clerks to perform in-court tasks they had done in the past, such as operating\n\nthe electronic recording equipment that had replaced most ofthe in-person court\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nreporters in Yakima and providing copies ofthose recordings as requested. The\nclerk's office had been providing such services to the Yakima County Superior\n\nCourt for years in exchange for extra staff and additional funding for the clerk's\n\noffice, while the staff and budget for the court were reduced accordingly. Id. at\n\n1177-78.\n\n\n       Although Riddle agreed before she took office that she would continue that\n\narrangement, after taking her oath of office she stated her intent to withdraw from\n\nit. E.g., id. at 1168. After a tense meeting between Riddle and the superior court\n\njudges on March 30, 2015, the Yakima County Superior Court adopted LAR 3,\n\nwhich \"describes actual current courtroom procedures and the responsibilities of\n\nthe Clerk of the Court while in court. The purpose ofthe rule is to maintain and\n\ncontinue current practice without interruption.\" LAR 3 was adopted on an\n\nemergency basis effective April 15, 2015, and on a permanent basis effective\n\nSeptember 1, 2015. However, despite the passage ofLAR 3, Riddle again asserted\n\nthat her deputy clerks would stop providing the in-court services specified in the\n\nrule. E.g., id. at 1223.\n\n       The court services director became sufficiently concerned about Riddle's\n\nassertions, and she brought the issue to the Yakima County Law and Justice\n\nCommittee, which caused the Board of Yakima County Commissioners to appoint\n\nan independent review panel in March 2016. The panel's initial report, issued on\n\n\n                                          17\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nMay 31, 2016, noted an attorney general opinion suggesting that the remedy for a\n\nclerk who refuses to follow a local court rule may be contempt proceedings.\n\n       On July 3, 2016, Riddle responded to the panel's report with a written\n\ndocument that opened,\"Dear Family, Friends and Supporters.\"^ M at 2113. As\n\nrelevant to Charge Three, Riddle's document included the following language:\n\n             I have been threatened with contempt and going to jail if I don't\n       do what the County Commissioners and Court want me to do.\n       Therefore, I have no choice other than to prepare for this possibility\n       by sending a Clerk's Directive to the Prosecuting Attorney. I don't\n       believe they realize what the severity ofthe consequences will be. I\n       would have no choice other than to revoke the deputization[ ]of all my\n       deputies (staff) and they would not be able to perform my duties in\n       my absence which would close the Clerk's Office. The Courts will\n       not be able to hear cases without a Clerk present so the Courts will\n       shut down. The jail will be overflowing because the Prosecutor will\n       have no way to prosecute individuals. I would hope they know these\n       consequences and will choose not to shut down our judicial system by\n       such an action. I would be given no choice as I must ensure my\n       mandated responsibilities are being met according to the law.\n\nId. at 2117. The disputes leading up to this document and the document itself are\n\nthe basis for Charge Three.\n\n              b.     Factual sufficiency\n\n       First, Riddle contends that Charge Three is factually insufficient because\n\nthere is no proofthat she actually \"failed\" to perform any in-court duties.\n\nHowever, Charge Three alleges that she \"[rjeflised and/or failed\" to perform those\n\n\n       ^ The document is dated \"July 3, 2015,\" but the parties agree that the document was\nactually written in 2016. CP at 2113.\n\n\n                                              18\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nduties. Id. at 2442(emphasis added). The facts clearly allege that Riddle refused\n\nto perform in-court duties and thus that Riddle refused and/or failed to perform\n\nthose duties,just as Charge Three states.\n\n       Next, Riddle argues that there is no proofthat she actually shut down the\n\ncourt as threatened. That is true, but irrelevant. Where an official credibly\n\nthreatens retaliation in his or her official capacity,\"such threats alone would be ...\n\nwrongful by any standard.\" In re Recall ofLee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613134\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613134/matter-of-recall-of-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619, 859 P.2d\n\n1244(1993). For instance, we held sufficient a charge that a mayor threatened to\n\nhave local law enforcement officers fired if they issued her a traffic citation. Id.\n\nLike Riddle in this case, the mayor in that case argued the charge was \"inadequate\n\nbecause it does not allege that any police officer ever refrained from issuing her a\n\ncitation because of what she said.\" Id. at 618-19.\n\n\n       We rejected that argument and held that \"[ejven if no officer ever refrained\n\nfrom issuing Mayor Lee a citation out of fear for his job,such threats alone would\n\nbe a clear abuse of the mayor's position of authority over the police department\n\nand would be wrongful by any standard.'\"^ Id. at 619(emphasis added). To the\n\nextent Riddle argues that the document at issue in this case was not a threat but a\n\n\n\n\n        Riddle attempts to distinguish this case on the basis that in Lee,\"the mayor's threat was\ncoupled with an action: a directive to subordinates to never issue her a ticket.\" Reply Br. of\nAppellant at 9. However, the decision in Lee was explicitly based on the threat alone, not a\nthreat coupled with an action.\n\n\n                                               19\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nmere expression of opinion regarding a hypothetical scenario, a reasonable person\n\nreading the language Riddle actually used might well reach a different conclusion.\n\n       Finally, Riddle argues that the alleged threat to shut down the court cannot\n\nbe factually sufficient because it was in a letter \"addressed to Ms. Riddle's\n\nsupporters, family and friends,\" not to the court. Br. of Appellant at 27.\n\nHowever,this letter was delivered to the Board of Yakima County Commissioners\n\nat one of its meetings. CP at 2036. Regardless ofthe opening salutation, the facts\n\nclearly allege that Riddle did not intend for this document to be a private\n\nexpression of opinion but a publicly directed statement of her intentions.\n\n       We affirm that Charge Three is factually sufficient.\n\n              c.     Legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle contends Charge Three is not legally sufficient because she had no\n\nobligation to perform in-court duties, and therefore she had a legally justifiable\n\nexcuse for refusing to perform them. She also argues that Charge Three cannot be\n\nlegally sufficient because she was exercising her First Amendment rights. U.S.\n\nConst, amend I. Riddle misapprehends the scope of her powers, her duties, and\n\nthe First Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n       First, Riddle contends that LAR 3 was enacted without authority oflaw and\n\nis therefore void, so she was justified in refusing to follow it.^ An action with a\n\nlegally justifiable excuse is not sufficient for recall, but Riddle's position is not\n\nlegally justifiable.\n\n       While Riddle is correct that she retains authority over the clerk's office, she\n\nfails to recognize that she is,\"by virtue of[her] office, clerk of the superior court.\"\n\nConst, art. IV, § 26. As we have explained,\n\n       [t]he duties of a county clerk as clerk of the superior court are defined\n       both by statute and court rules. Generally speaking, a clerk of court is\n       an officer of a court ofjustice, who attends to the clerical portion of\n       its business, and who has custody of its records and files and of its\n       seal. Such an office is essentially ministerial in its nature, and the\n       clerk is neither the court nor a judicial officer.\n\nSwanson v. Olympic Peninsula Motor Coach Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3992428\"><a href=\"/opinion/4217875/swanson-v-olympic-peninsula-m-coach-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38,66 P.2d 842\n\n(1937)(emphasis added). The superior court \"has power ...[t]o control, in\n\nfurtherance ofjustice, the conduct of its ministerial officers,\" such as county\n\nclerks. RCW 2.28.010(5). Therefore, when acting as the clerk ofthe superior\n\ncourt, the county clerk has always been required \"[i]n the performance of his or her\n\nduties to conform to the direction ofthe court.\" RCW 2.32.050(9); see Laws OF\n\n1891, ch. 57, § 3(9). The clerk's general powers and duties as clerk ofthe superior\n\n\n\n\n        ^ Riddle also argues that her initial agreement to provide in-court services is without force\nbecause she entered the agreement prior to taking office. This is irrelevant because the charge is\nthat she refused to perform duties required by law—^that is, by statute and court rule.\n\n                                                 21\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\ncourt are set forth in RCW 2.32.050 and, for Yakima County specifically, LAR 3\n\nand 7 through 10.\n\n       Riddle contends that LAR 3, which addresses in-court duties, is void\n\nbecause the court has no authority to \"dictate the personnel functions of a different\n\nCounty department.\" Br. of Appellant at 28. However, as the preceding paragraph\n\nexplains, a court does have the authority to direct the functions of the clerk when\n\nhe or she is acting in his or her capacity as clerk ofthe superior court. Cf. SAR\n\n16(f)(powers and duties of the Clerk of the Supreme Court). Moreover, the\n\nattorney general has opined that a court's rule-making authority in regard to court\n\nclerks is subject to the same restrictions as any other rules: \"[T]o the extent that the\n\ncourt rule relates to practice and procedure rather than to the creation of\n\nsubstantive law, the rule is within the authority of the court.\" 2001 Op. Att'y Gen.\n\nNo. 6, at 3. LAR 3 is within the scope ofthe court's rule-making authority, and\n\nRiddle has no legally justifiable excuse for refusing to follow it.\n\n       Second, Riddle contends that her alleged threat to shut down the court was\n\nan expression of opinion protected by the First Amendment and that such protected\n\nexpression cannot be grounds for recall. Riddle appears to be unaware that the\n\nFirst Amendment prevents governments from restricting or chilling free speech.\n\n16A Am.Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 400(2008). A recall proceeding is an\n\naction by the voters, not the government. CONST, art. I, § 33. The voters\n\n\n                                           22\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\nunquestionably have a right to base their decisions on what a public official says,\n\nthe First Amendment notwithstanding.\n\n       While Riddle cites authorities, they do not support her position. One ofthe\n\ncases cited, which does not deal with recall, holds that \"[t]o be sure, the First\n\nAmendment protects [the plaintiff]'s discordant speech as a general matter; it does\n\nnot, however, immunize him from the political fallout of what he says.\" Blair v.\n\nBethel Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148502\"><a href=\"/opinion/148502/blair-v-bethel-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542(9th Cir. 2010), cited in Br. of Appellant at 33.\n\nAnother, which also does not deal with recall, notes that \"[ojur case law recognizes\n\nthat the nature of political debate is rough and tumble.\" Eaton v.

And the only case\n\nRiddle cites that does involve a recall proceeding dealt with very different\n\nquestions about a charge that the official committed perjury and false swearing. In\n\nre Recall ofPearsall-Stipek, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 P.3d 1034(2000), cited in Br. of\n\nAppellant at 34. The court was required to determine whether the elements of\n\nthose crimes were properly alleged by the facts underlying the charge. It did not\n\nengage in any discussion of free speech principles.\n\n       Because Riddle's contentions do not have merit, we affirm the trial court's\n\nruling that Charge Three is factually and legally sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n       4.     Charge Four: failure to account\n\n       Charge Four states that Riddle \"[f]ailed, between January 2015 and\n\nDecember 2016 to properly maintain account ofthe monies received by the\n\nYakima County Clerk's Office.\" CP at 2442. We affirm the trial court's ruling\n\nthat Charge Four is factually and legally sufficient,\n\n              a.     Background\n\n       The Washington State auditor performed a scheduled audit ofthe Yakima\n\nCounty Clerk's Office covering the year from January 1 to December 31, 2015.\n\nThe audit determined that stronger internal controls and oversight were needed,\n\nnoting, among other problems, that several important tasks were not completed\n\nuntil long after they were due and the clerk's office had failed to maintain proper\n\ndocumentation needed for an outsider to verify that collections had been performed\n\ncorrectly.\n\n       The audit noted that similar concerns had been raised in two prior audits, but\n\napparently had not been fixed. The cause of the problems, according to the audit\n\nreport, was that \"[t]he Clerk's Office has not devoted sufficient time and resources\n\nto ensure proper segregation of duties exists over cash handling and account\n\nreconciliations and has not taken the necessary steps to correct reconciliation items\n\nnoted in the previous audit.\" Id. at 2131.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n               b.    Factual and legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle's contentions regarding the sufficiency of Charge Four are\n\nindistinguishable from those she raises in regard to Charges One and Two. We\n\nreject these arguments in accordance with the analysis ofthe factual and legal\n\nsufficiency of Charge One, above, and affirm the sufficiency of Charge Four.\n\n       5.      Charge Five; failure to collect jury service fees\n\n       Charge Five alleges that Riddle \"[fjailed, between May 2016 and October\n\n2016 to enact procedures to collect for jury services rendered to other courts\n\nresulting in a delay of revenue.\" Id. at 2442.\n\n               a.    Background\n\n       In addition to the Yakima Counly Superior Court, the Yakima County\n\nClerk's Office provides jury services for one district court and three municipal\n\ncourts. The clerk's office is supposed to bill those courts for jury services once a\n\nmonth. However,the Washington State Auditor's Office determined that\n\n       [t]he Clerk has not established procedures to ensure the Office is paid\n       for these services. The Office has not billed or collected for jury\n       services provided to the District Court and two municipal courts from\n       May 2015 through August 2016. We estimate these services to be\n       approximately $44,500. In addition, the Clerk provided jury services\n       for one municipal court without an agreement in place from May 2015\n       to September 2016. The agreement was subsequently signed and\n       billed in October 2016 for $52,411, sixteen months after the service\n       period started.\n\nId. at 2130.\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n              b.     Factual and legal sufficiency\n\n       Riddle's contentions regarding the sufficiency of Charge Five are\n\nindistinguishable from those She raises in regard to Charges One, Two, and Four.\n\nWe reject these arguments in accordance with the analysis ofthe factual and legal\n\nsufficiency of Charge One, above, and affirm the sufficiency of Charge Five.\n\n       6.     Challenge based on the timing of the next general election\n\n       Finally, Riddle briefly notes that she will be up for election soon anyway,\n\nimplying that the recall proceeding is therefore unnecessary. Certainly the recall\n\npetitioners, if unsuccessful, may take solace in the fact that Riddle is up for\n\nreelection soon, but\"we do not suggest that the imminence of a regular election\n\njustifies dismissing a recall petition.\" Sandhaus, 134 Wn.2d at 672. The timing of\n\nthe next election is irrelevant to our analysis.\n\nB.     Ballot Synopsis\n\n       Finally, Riddle challenges the adequacy of the ballot synopsis for its failure\n\nto identify which charges are malfeasance, which are misfeasance, and which are\n\nviolations ofthe oath of office. We decline to review this issue because \"[t]he\n\ndecision ofthe superior court concerning the adequacy ofthe ballot synopsis is\n\n'final.'\" In re Recall ofZufelt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1179496\"><a href=\"/opinion/1179496/in-re-zufelt/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 910, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1179496\"><a href=\"/opinion/1179496/in-re-zufelt/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989); see\n\nRCW 29A.56.140.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1\n\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n\n       We affirm the trial court's ruling that the five remaining recall charges\n\nagainst Riddle are factually and legally sufficient, and the recall proceeding may\n\nmove forward to the signature-gathering phase.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fIn re Recall ofRiddle, No. 94788-1 ,\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n-Hu                  ^ (L                          r*\n\n\n\n\n                           'V\n\n\n\n\n        1'\n\n                                            ,7/t: e2.\n\n\n\n\n                                       28\n\f</pre>",
