The Court commutes applicant's death sentence to a life sentence\r\nbased upon its decision that the record supports a finding that applicant is mentally retarded. \r\nHowever, after a careful consideration of all of the evidence, I would hold that the record does not\r\nsupport this finding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Atkins v. Virginia</em>, the United States Supreme Court decided that the Eighth Amendment's\r\n\"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\" prohibit executing\r\nmentally retarded people.  <em>See Atkins v. Virginia</em>, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 2247-52 (2002).  <em>Atkins</em> left to the\r\nstates \"the task of developing appropriate ways\" to determine \"which offenders are in fact retarded.\" \r\n<em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2250.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response to this, this Court in <em>Ex parte Briseno</em> adopted the American Association on\r\nMental Retardation (AAMR) criteria, which are codified in Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code §\r\n591.003(13), and some other evidentiary factors in addressing <em>Atkins</em> mental retardation claims.  <em>See\r\nEx</em> <em>parte Briseno</em>, S.W.3d slip op. at 8-9, 11-12 (Tex.Cr.App. No. 29,819-03, delivered\r\nFebruary 11, 2004) (mental retardation means \"significant subaverage general intellectual\r\nfunctioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates during the\r\ndevelopmental period\").<sup> (1)</sup>  We also stated in <em>Briseno</em> that \"the ultimate issue of whether [a] person\r\nis, in fact, mentally retarded for purposes of the Eighth Amendment ban on excessive punishment\r\nis one for the finder of fact, based upon all of the evidence and determinations of credibility.\"  <em>See\r\nBriseno</em>, slip op. at 12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis latter statement, however, does not quite apply to this habeas proceeding for several\r\nreasons.  The record in this habeas proceeding reflects that, in exchange for applicant's guilty plea\r\nto several criminal offenses, the State agreed to a commutation of applicant's death sentence to a life\r\nsentence contingent on acceptance by the habeas court and this Court, of the parties' agreed finding\r\nand agreed evidence that applicant is mentally retarded.  The State reserved \"the right to oppose a\r\nfinding of mental retardation\" if this agreement cannot be fulfilled.  In relevant part, this agreement,\r\nin the form of a letter from the State to applicant's lawyer, states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is anticipated, understood, and expected that once your client [applicant] has plead\r\nguilty to the above five (5) offenses, and the same day and at the same proceeding in\r\nwhich your client pleads, <strong>and only in the event that your client pleads to the\r\nabove, the state will agree and stipulate that your client is mentally retarded</strong> and\r\nthat the state and yourself will present the [habeas court] with Agreed Findings of\r\nFact and Conclusions of Law, along with <strong>agreed evidence</strong> of your client's mental\r\nretardation to that end.  The state will further agree and request that your client's\r\nsentence of death be commuted to life.  The parties hereto further understand and\r\nstipulate that this agreement is contingent upon [the habeas court's] acceptance of\r\nAgreed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the Court of Criminal Appeals'\r\nadoption of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that find [applicant] to be\r\nmentally retarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn the event that [applicant] does not plead guilty to the above referenced offenses or\r\nin the event [the habeas court] or the Court of Criminal Appeals does not accept or\r\nadopt the Agreed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, <strong>the state reserves the\r\nright to oppose a finding of mental retardation</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe agreed evidence between the State and applicant consists of Kartye's 1985, Brownlee's\r\n1988, and Clark's 1992 psychological evaluations of applicant which are discussed in the Court's\r\nopinion.  <em>See Ex parte Modden</em>, S.W.3d slip op. at 5-7 (Tex.Cr.App. No. 74,715, delivered this\r\ndate).  Without hearing any live testimony, the habeas court apparently accepted these psychological\r\nevaluations and signed off on the parties' agreed finding that applicant is mentally retarded.  This\r\nfinding tracks the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.  <em>See\r\nBriseno</em>, slip op. at 8-9, 11-12.  But, none of these psychological evaluations state that they are based\r\non the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.  And, neither Kartye,\r\nBrownlee nor Clark have ever testified that their psychological evaluations and opinions are based\r\non the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe agreed finding in this habeas proceeding that applicant is mentally retarded also is not\r\nthe result of \"determinations of credibility\" at an adversarial live hearing meant to test the truth of\r\napplicant's mental retardation claim.  More important, the parties' agreed evidence does not take into\r\naccount all of the evidence pertinent to applicant's claim of mental retardation from applicant's 1985\r\ntrial and his 1992 retrial.  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 12 (mental retardation determination must be based\r\nupon all of the evidence).  For example, the parties litigated applicant's mental retardation claim in\r\nan adversarial setting before a jury at applicant's 1992 retrial where the State presented its own\r\npsychological expert who testified that applicant is not mentally retarded.<sup> (2)</sup>  It is fairly obvious from\r\nexamining the 1992 record from applicant's 1992 retrial that the jury rejected applicant's claim that\r\nhe is mentally retarded.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See Ex parte Taylor</em>, 101 S.W.3d 434, 440-45 (Tex.Cr.App. 2002)\r\n(determining from an examination of the record what a jury found by a general not guilty verdict). \r\n<em>Briseno</em>, therefore, does not require this Court to accept the agreed finding that applicant is mentally\r\nretarded based on Kartye's 1985, Brownlee's 1988, and Clark's 1992 psychological evaluations of\r\napplicant.  This is not to say that these evaluations are irrelevant, but they should be considered with\r\nall of the other relevant evidence that completes the inquiry into applicant's claim of mental\r\nretardation.<sup> (4)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOverwhelming evidence was presented at applicant's 1985 and 1992 trials that applicant\r\nmeets very few, if any, of the <em>Briseno</em> factors and that applicant is nothing like Steinbeck's childlike\r\nLennie.<sup> (5)</sup>  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 8, 12.  This evidence indicates that applicant has been a violent\r\ncriminal for most of his adult life.  Though the evidence does indicate that applicant may have\r\nlimited intellectual capabilities, it also indicates that no one considered applicant to be mentally\r\nretarded while he was growing up and that upon reaching adulthood applicant has been able to take\r\ncare of himself both in and out of prison where (even before he committed this capital offense in\r\n1984) he spent a good part of his adult life.  The thrust of his mental deficiency evidence at both his\r\n1985 and 1992 trials is that applicant's mental deficiencies cause him to have poor impulse control\r\nand to be influenced by others for their own means, and that all of this is exacerbated by applicant's\r\nfrequent use of alcohol.  But the evidence shows that many of the criminal offenses that applicant\r\nhas committed during his life were planned and carried out all by himself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence also indicates that applicant might even possess some leadership qualities.  For\r\nexample, a September 6, 1982, prison disciplinary report indicates that applicant was placed in\r\nAdministrative Segregation for inciting other inmates not to perform their work duties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn September 6, 1982, at approximately 3:15 P.M., I noticed that the trays in both\r\nthe North and South Dishrooms were stacking up and not being washed.  I then\r\nentered the dishroom and found that all of the inmates assigned to the Dishroom were\r\nrefusing to wash any of the trays.  These inmates were [applicant and five others]. \r\nThese inmates stated that they were refusing to wash any dishes because they could\r\nnot get any ice water in the Dishroom. [Applicant] was placed in Administrative\r\nSegregation in order to prevent the inciting of further work stoppages and to prevent\r\nthe disruption of unit procedures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence also indicates that applicant is capable of responding \"coherently, rationally\r\nand on point to oral or written questions.\"  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 12.  For example, an October 5,\r\n1982, prison disciplinary report states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn October 5, 1982, at approximately 2:20 P.M. while A/L work force was cutting\r\nweeds, [applicant] was overheard to say \"Fuck the boss and old motor mouth too.\" \r\nUpon questioning [applicant] he again stated \"Fuck you and the Captain because\r\nyou'll [sic] ain't going to fuck with me.\"  I told [applicant] to go to work and he\r\nreplied \"If I get a case, I am not going to work and I am going to sue your ass.[\"]\r\n[Applicant] was placed in adminsstrative [sic] segregation in order to prevent a\r\ndisruption of unit procedures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe record further indicates that applicant presented no evidence at his 1985 trial that he was\r\nmentally retarded.  Kartye's 1985 psychological evaluation, which was admitted into evidence at that\r\ntrial, does not conclude that applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded.\"<sup> (6)</sup>  And, Kartye never testified at\r\napplicant's 1985 trial that applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded.\"  Kartye never even used the term\r\n\"mental retardation\" at applicant's 1985 trial.  Kartye testified that applicant's \"limited intellectual\r\nresources\" caused him to have \"impulse control problems\" but that applicant was also capable of\r\nacting deliberately.<sup> (7)</sup>  It is also significant that applicant filed a coherent <em>pro se</em> brief on direct appeal\r\nfrom his 1985 capital murder conviction.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant did claim that he was mentally retarded at his 1992 retrial after the United States\r\nSupreme Court had decided <em>Penry v. Lynaugh</em> which held that the then-existing Texas special issues\r\nframework failed to provide Penry's jury with a vehicle to give mitigating effect to relevant\r\nmitigating evidence of Penry's severe mental retardation.<sup> (9)</sup>  Two psychological evaluations of\r\napplicant (Brownlee's 1988 evaluation and Clark's 1992 evaluation), concluding for the first time\r\nthat applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded,\"<sup> (10)</sup> were admitted into evidence at applicant's 1992 retrial. \r\nBefore this no one had ever previously noticed applicant's mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBrownlee did not testify at applicant's 1992 retrial.  According to Brownlee's 1988\r\nevaluation, applicant, unlike Steinbeck's Lennie, enjoys torturing animals.  This evaluation, among\r\nother things, states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Applicant] said that he tortured animals often, either by burning them or hanging\r\nthem.  Upon exploration of the feelings associated with that, he had no affective\r\nstatement, but he said he did like to see them suffer and squirm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tClark testified at applicant's 1992 retrial.  Among other things, she testified that she would\r\nplace applicant \"somewhere as far as functioning in the lower three to five percent of the\r\npopulation,\" meaning apparently that, according to Clark, three to five percent of the population is\r\n\"mildly mentally retarded\" which interestingly is about three to five times more than that claimed\r\nby the defense expert in <em>Atkins</em>.  <em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2245 n.5 (forensic defense psychologist\r\ntestified that mental retardation is \"a relatively rare thing\" affecting \"about one percent of the\r\npopulation\").  The State commented on this during closing jury arguments:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNow, let's talk about psychologists a little bit.  Dr. Frankie Clark came up here, and\r\nI think she testified as to her honest opinion.  She says he's retarded.  She says about\r\n50 people out of 1,000 would be about in the same boat as the Defendant.  So if there\r\nare 30,000 people in our town, about 1,500 are in the same boat as Willie Mack\r\nModden.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State presented its own psychological expert at applicant's 1992 retrial.  This is the only\r\npsychological expert to testify on the issue of applicant's mental retardation based on the AAMR and\r\nthe Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.  Mostly through the use of supported-by-the-evidence hypotheticals, the State's psychological expert testified at applicant's 1992 retrial that\r\napplicant is not mentally retarded under the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of\r\nmental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, Dr. Quijano, you know that one of the things in controversy in this\r\ntrial is the issue of mental retardation.  Could you tell the jury, please, sir, what is\r\nmental retardation?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Mental retardation is a condition of an individual that has to meet three criteria,\r\nand all three must be met before the label of mental retardation can be legitimately\r\ngiven.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tNumber 1, the individual must have a subaverage or below-average intellectual\r\nfunctioning as measured by an individually administered intellectual test, intelligence\r\ntest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tNumber 2, which is very important, and that is, the individual must have an adaptive\r\ndaily functioning skill that's below average and that would require constant\r\nsupervision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tNumber 3, that these two deficits, the intellectual as well as the adaptive deficits,\r\nmust occur before age 18 to rule out victims of stroke and accidents with brain\r\ntrauma.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, doctor, you mentioned functioning skills and adaptive behavior. \r\nWhat sort of things are you talking about?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. By adaptive skills, we mean the skills needed by an individual to live on a day-to-day basis.  And those are-the questions asked are as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAre they able to take care of their own personal hygiene?  Can they eat without\r\nassistance?  Can they recognize hunger?  Can they procure food for themselves?  Can\r\nthey cook simple meals?  Can they recognize danger in that you don't cross the street\r\nwhen a big truck is coming your way?  Can they go to a store and negotiate a\r\npurchase?  Can they know if they're being cheated by somebody else?  Can they take\r\nmedicine when they are told to or when they need to?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAll of these things are considered adaptive skills, or some people call them daily\r\nskills of daily living. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Dr. Quijano, let me ask you this.  Assume, please, sir, that the person-the\r\nDefendant that we're concerned with here today, Willie Mack Modden-assume that\r\nthere is evidence that the Defendant is able to play dominoes, to keep score; assume\r\nthat he is able to play chess.  Assume that he is able to play basketball.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAssume that he is able to order materials and construct jewelry boxes out of\r\nmatchsticks with designs.  And assume that he is able to negotiate to sell those to\r\npeople.  Assume that he says, hey, buy this for your girl friend; I know you've got a\r\ngirl friend or somebody you want to give this to; hey, will you give me $15; you\r\nwon't do that; will you give me 12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAssume, doctor, that we're dealing with an individual who, by himself, stashed a gun\r\nand kept it for some period of time and until he needed it; then he went and got the\r\ngun, and he went and hid in some bushes outside of a convenience store.  And he\r\nwaited until near closing time, and he waited until the lady took the trash out.  And\r\nhe pulled the gun on her, and he made her go back in the store.  And he made her\r\ngive him the money.  And then assume, doctor, that he made the woman pull her\r\nclothes off so that she would have to re-dress to avoid embarrassment before she\r\nsummoned help to give him more time to get away.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAssume, doctor, that this person, when they were incarcerated in TDC, learned the\r\nrules and regulations of the Texas Department of Corrections.  And assume that if a\r\nguard did something that he didn't approve of or that he felt was against the rules,\r\nthat he would summon another guard.  And if that guard was not able to answer his\r\nquestion, assume, doctor, that he would summon the supervisor, such as the sergeant,\r\nand that he would verbalize his complaint and say: this is against the rules; that man\r\ncan't do that to me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnd assume, doctor, that this person were incarcerated in jail.  And assume that they\r\ndecided that they wanted to escape.  And assume that they got with other inmates,\r\nand assume that they battered a hole in the wall.  And assume that the Defendant\r\nsaid, I'm going to get out, and I'm going to burn down the courthouse so there won't\r\nbe records on me.  And assume, doctor, that this person said, I'm then going to go kill\r\nthe people that helped put me in the penitentiary in the first place.[<sup> (11)</sup>]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnd assume, doctor, that this person were [sic] offended by somebody.  Assume\r\nsomebody hit this person when they were in the penitentiary.  And assume that they\r\nprocured razor blades, and assume that they melted them into the handle of a\r\ntoothbrush.  And assume that they waited until the next day when the offending\r\nperson was in the shower and had their face lathered up.  And assume that this person\r\nthen went in and cut that person's throat.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDoctor, are these things consistent with a mentally retarded person?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. No, they are not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Can you tell me why they're not?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. The hallmark of a mentally retarded person is simplicity of thinking; that they can\r\nmaybe handle one thing at a time, maybe two.  The mentally retarded people used to\r\nbe called the simpleminded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThese behaviors that you have described are very complex behaviors.  They require\r\nmultiple steps in the mind.  They require that you-that you keep four or five, six\r\ndifferent things in mind and then manipulate them intellectually and mentally.  Those\r\nare complex acts.  The planning, the forethought, the anticipation of consequences,\r\nthe thinking on the feet; all of those are complex mental activities that a true mentally\r\nretarded person, by definition, cannot do.[<sup> (12)</sup>]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis expert also provided several explanations on why applicant's IQ test scores contained\r\nin his penitentiary records ranged from 57 to 83 before he got into this current trouble.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, in this record where it shows the Defendant's age of 18, which is\r\nmarked as State's Exhibit 26, it shows an IQ score of 57?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. That's correct. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, in this record, which is State's Exhibit Number 28, and it shows the\r\nDefendant's age as 26.  What IQ score does it show?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. It shows 83.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Now, I will-these records are here, doctor, if you need to look at them further to\r\nexplain that; but I'd like to discuss that with the jury and-how do you account or can\r\nyou account, sir, for the wide range in variations of IQ scores in the 57 range all the\r\nway up to 83.  What's the deal?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Okay.  The-given this information, if I were asked to account for that-assuming\r\nthat the tests were administered properly, and the only thing has changed would be\r\nthe motivation of the person taking the test.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIf you are tested before your trial, it is to your best interests to test down.  If you are\r\ntested after the trial, once you're in prison where you may be wanting a better job\r\nassignment, where you may be wanting to go to school, or where you may be wanting\r\na more free living arrangement-the better you are off, the better your chances are\r\nbecause if you are retarded in a prison, then your movements are limited.  You're\r\nsupervised more.  You cannot get good jobs and so on and so forth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSo one possibility is that you are now-you are no longer playing to the problem of\r\nfacing charges; that is all behind you, and you are testing better and maybe more\r\naccurately.  However, there are prisoners who would say, I tested down, because\r\nthese people may want to be assigned to Beto I, which is closer to their home, and\r\nthat is where the mentally retarded program is; and you test down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOr you may want to have other programs available for the mentally retarded that that\r\nis not available for general population.  And people do that all the time.  They get to\r\nthe MR program; and they say, well, this is not what I expected; give me another test. \r\nAnd they test higher, and we kick them out.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Dr. Quijano, let me ask you this.  I believe that the test where the IQ score is 83\r\nshows an interview on September the 10<sup>th</sup>, 1974.  Now, would there be any change-is\r\nthere any reason for a person to change their attitude toward testing between 1974\r\nand now in the penitentiary system to your knowledge?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Could you explain that to the jury, please, sir?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Before 1984, when I went back to the system to implement the federal court\r\norders, there was no specialized program for the mentally retarded, and there was no\r\nspecial arrangement for them.  You were essentially treated by the system the way the\r\nsystem thought mentally retarded people should be treated.  And the motivation at\r\nthat time was to test up because you have to compete with other inmates for better\r\njobs.  These days there is less motivation for that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe motivation now, depending on what you want, is to test down because you have\r\na richer environment in a specialized program.  Our mentally retarded program is a\r\nvery expensive program because you have case managers and music therapy and\r\noccupational therapy.  You have your own gymnasium.  You have your own schools. \r\nIt's a lot richer program.  You have basic janitorial skills training and job programs. \r\nSo the motivation has shifted in the prison, depending on what you want to\r\naccomplish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis expert also testified that a person cannot fake a higher IQ score \"because you either\r\nknow the answer or you don't.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. I've got a couple of things, Dr. Quijano, that I want you to look at.  I'm going to\r\ntry to be brief on this.  This is Dr. Clark's report, I believe.  And we've got Dr.\r\nKartye's test here.  And this, I believe, is a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Brownlee. \r\nOkay?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, I want to talk about the two tests which have scores on them.  Now, doctor, I'll\r\nask you to-well, there's a date on this.  We don't have to assume anything. \r\nExamined 1-26-1985; examination, 7-11-92.  Now, you mentioned performance IQ. \r\nAnd I believe that Dr. Kartye's report reflects a performance IQ of 74, and Dr.\r\nClark's report reflects a performance IQ of 65.  Is this, the more recent test, lower?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. What-how do you square that up?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Well, two possibilities.  The most recent test is more suspect than the previous\r\ntest for two reasons.  Number one, a person cannot fake correct answers because, if\r\nyou give the correct answers, you obviously know the correct answers.  So it is-if\r\nyou score high-if you're asked questions, and you gave the answers, you obviously\r\nknow at this level.  It is much easier to say, I don't know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIt's easier to fake lower scores than to fake higher scores.  You cannot fake higher\r\nscores because you either know the answer or you don't.  You can fake a lower score\r\nby saying, I don't know, or if you don't have enough motivation to complete the test,\r\nor if you're not trying too hard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe second possibility in which our profession is warned against is testing when one\r\nis in trouble.  You must always suspect what we call malingering; that is, an\r\nexaggeration of symptoms when one is in trouble because of our human nature to\r\nprotect ourselves.  And so these scores can be explained by those two possibilities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State's expert also testified that his opinion about applicant's mental capacity was based\r\nin part on applicant's prison records before he got into this current trouble and that any testing of\r\napplicant after he got into this trouble would be of no benefit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Do you have sufficient information at your disposal to form an opinion\r\nabout him and his mental capacity?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  And you have how many years' worth of penitentiary records?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. The Defendant's records?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Not mine.  Okay.  Four tenures in TDC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. I don't know the exact number of years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And, doctor, do you have at your disposal the test results of other psychologists?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Would it be of benefit to you to be able to test the Defendant?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. At this late stage it would not be of benefit to me or anybody to test him because\r\nof the motivation factor.  A person that's in trouble-and the answers are now\r\nquestionable, and we can repeat this over and over again, and we'll get different test\r\nresults, depending on what the situation is.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe best evidence that applicant is not mentally retarded came from applicant himself when\r\nhe testified at his 1985 trial.<sup> (13)</sup>  Applicant testified at the punishment phase of his 1985 trial how he\r\nrobbed a convenience store clerk and stabbed her 16 times in the face and neck while she begged for\r\nher life and implored applicant to consider her three children. Applicant later, matter-of-factly,\r\ndescribed to several friends how he murdered the sobbing and terrified victim.  Applicant testified\r\nthat he decided to kill the victim before he actually killed her (meaning that he \"deliberately\" killed\r\nher).  He testified that he killed the victim because he did not want to leave any witnesses. \r\nApplicant's testimony from the punishment phase of this trial also indicates that after the crime\r\napplicant was smart enough to destroy evidence and to \"artfully dodge\" police questioning about his\r\ninvolvement in the crime.<sup> (14)</sup>  Applicant also testified about his plan to take a hostage and escape from\r\nthe county jail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State's psychological expert testified at applicant's 1992 retrial that, in forming opinions\r\nabout a person's mental ability, it is also important \"to look at what the person actually does\" and\r\nnot to make judgments \"about a person's character on the basis of test results only.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Doctor, is it possible to look at what someone actually does and use that as a basis\r\nfor an opinion as to that person's mental ability or that person's future behavior, just\r\nas you could use test results?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Well, it's more important to look at what the person actually does.  And it is not\r\nprofessional or ethical to make a judgment about a person's character on the basis of\r\ntest results only.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tResponding to Kartye's psychological testimony, the State argued during closing jury\r\narguments at applicant's 1985 trial:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThen you have to go toward the glimmer of hope that you can get somebody\r\nsidetracked on some collateral issue.  As it turned out, it was totally insignificant in\r\nanswering those two questions.  And that is when in desperation, Joe Kartye was\r\ncalled to testify.  You know, Joe Karty [sic].  I like Joe Karty [sic].  He's a likeable\r\ntype person.  I didn't agree with him on some things.  Some things I don't disagree\r\nwith him on.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tFor instance, the report that you have shows that [applicant] has a low I.Q. and he is\r\neasy led [sic] and he strikes out and he acts impulsively.  And I believe a lot of that. \r\nI don't think that he is the most intelligent person in the world, but I think he is\r\nsmarter than Mr. Kartye gives him credit for being.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnd you saw him on the witness stand.  On direct examination and cross examination\r\nand on many occasions he corrected what his attorney said.  He would back up and\r\nre-phrase what I said or whatever the situation was.  This man is very alert as to what\r\nwas going on, and he knows the consequences of what he was doing, and that is why\r\nwe are here today on the issues of deliberate and probability.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConsidered in its entirety, the record does not support the habeas court's finding that\r\napplicant is mentally retarded.  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 18 -19 (this Court's review of a trial court's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law on a mental retardation claim \"remains the same as it has\r\nalways been on habeas corpus applications,\" and this Court may reject the habeas court's findings\r\nthat the record does not support).  The evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding that applicant\r\nis not mentally retarded, and the contrary opinions of applicant's psychological experts can politely\r\nbe described as \"incredulous as a matter of law.\"  <em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2246 (noting that the\r\ndissenters in the Virginia Supreme Court rejected the state's expert opinion that Atkins possesses\r\naverage intelligence as \"incredulous as a matter of law\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Court's opinion makes much of the habeas court's pre-<em>Penry</em> finding from a 1988 habeas\r\nproceeding that applicant is  \"mentally retarded\"<sup> (15)</sup> and of this Court's 1992 opinion from that\r\nproceeding deciding that applicant's \"evidence of mental retardation\" entitled him to a new trial\r\nunder <em>Penry</em>.<sup> (16)</sup>  The record does indeed reflect that in 1988 applicant filed a habeas corpus\r\napplication claiming, among many other things, that the execution of a mentally retarded person\r\nwould violate the Eighth Amendment and that this very issue was then pending in the United States\r\nSupreme Court in <em>Penry</em>.  The record also reflects that the habeas court conducted a hearing on this\r\nhabeas corpus application in November 1988.  At this hearing Kartye testified on behalf of the State. \r\nKartye actually used the term and, testified for the first time that applicant was suffering from, \"mild\r\nmental retardation.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: Dr. Kartye, you're the same Dr. Kartye who previously examined\r\n[applicant], were you not?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. According to your examination, did you make a determination as to his level of\r\nintelligence?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And do you recall what that was?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Mild mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tKartye also testified on direct examination that applicant was capable of acting\r\n\"deliberately.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: From having examined [applicant], Doctor, I would ask if whether or\r\nnot you feel he could ever act deliberately?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: Yes, I feel that he can.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross-examination, Kartye testified that applicant could adequately function outside an\r\ninstitutional environment but not without endangering himself or others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [DEFENSE]: Dr. Kartye, in the report that you provided during the trial of this\r\ncase in 1985, you stated and I quote, \"It would appear that [applicant] lacks cognitive\r\nand behavioral controls necessary to effectively regulate his behavior.\"  Do you recall\r\nthat statement?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Do you believe that that's the truth?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And with regard to your testimony here this morning, did I understand you to state\r\ncorrectly that most mildly retarded persons can function adequately outside an\r\ninstitutional environment?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, they can.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Do you believe that [applicant] can?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. He has functioned outside the environment all his life until he was arrested.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. You're aware of his criminal record, aren't you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tQ. Do you think he could function outside a structured environment without endangering\r\nhimself or others?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. No.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOn re-direct examination, Kartye testified that applicant's inability to function outside of a\r\nstructured environment without hurting other people was because of his past criminal history and\r\nnot because of his degree of mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: Dr. Kartye, just one question.  You said a minute ago that, in your\r\nopinion, [applicant] could not function outside-in society without doing harm to\r\nhimself or others; is that correct?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: That is correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Is that based-do you base that opinion on his degree of mental retardation or his\r\npast criminal history?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. His past criminal history.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBrownlee testified at the November 1988 habeas hearing on applicant's behalf.  Brownlee\r\ntestified that applicant is mentally retarded which causes applicant not to have the intellectual\r\ncapability to act \"deliberately\" or \"intentionally\" or of being \"sane.\"  For example, Brownlee\r\ntestified how applicant's mental retardation causes applicant not to have the intellectual capability\r\nto be \"sane\" in the sense of knowing the difference between right and wrong and that for applicant\r\n\"hurting another person would be like soiling his pants.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: Why do-why would he try to hide his wrong if he didn't know the\r\ndifference?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [BROWNLEE]: Because there's a higher level of wrong that we imply to being\r\ncaught in doing something bad.  You know, there is a certain degree of shame at\r\nmessing your pants, and I'm sure that, you know, [applicant] would have that shame\r\nif he soiled his pants.  And in his mind hurting another person would be like soiling\r\nhis pants.  It's a thing that causes shame, but it's not something that you feel so bad\r\nabout because you understand the long-term implications of death, that you\r\nunderstand the impact on other people.  Like he told me in my interview, he made\r\n[the victim] go to Heaven, and people should be happy about that.  That's an absurd\r\nassumption for a person who has a higher degree of intelligence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. So you really think that he thinks he did nothing wrong, and they should be happy\r\nbecause he made her go to Heaven?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. That's what he told me, yeah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBrownlee also testified that Kartye's psychological report was \"insufficient to help [him] in\r\nany way.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [DEFENSE]: Referring you back to Dr. Kartye's report, based on your knowledge\r\nand experience as a psychiatrist, do you have an opinion as to the overall quality of\r\nhis examination of [applicant]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [BROWNLEE]: If this was a report prepared by a psychologist that I would\r\nask-I'd have him redo it because it's insufficient to help me in any way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State also presented several police witnesses who testified that, during their numerous\r\ninteractions with applicant prior to his 1985 trial, they did not notice applicant's  mental retardation. \r\nOne of these witnesses apparently surprised the defense when he testified that he has \"personal\r\nknowledge of how a mentally retarded person might\" act.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [DEFENSE]: Have you had experience before in your work with mentally\r\nretarded defendants?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [MORRIS]: Would you-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  Have you ever-in the course of your investigation as an officer of the Department\r\nof Public Safety, have you ever dealt with mentally retarded defendants?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Not that I know of, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. So you don't-you don't have any personal knowledge of how a mentally retarded\r\nperson might interact with you as opposed to a person of normal intelligence?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And what is that based on?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. I have a son that's [sic] mentally retarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. But you've never dealt with any mentally retarded defendants?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. No, I have not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And you had no reason in your discussion with [applicant] to think that he was\r\nmentally retarded?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. I do not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[DEFENSE]: Pass the witness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tTo the extent that the Court's opinion suggests that the habeas court's finding in the 1988\r\nhabeas proceeding that applicant is \"mildly\" mentally retarded is dispositive or collaterally estops\r\na consideration of all of the other evidence, it is significant to point out that the habeas court made\r\nthis finding before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Penry</em>.  This finding, therefore, was not\r\nessential to the habeas court's determinations in the 1988 habeas proceeding, and the State did not\r\nneed to fully and fairly adjudicate the issue of applicant's mental retardation at this time.  <em>Cf. Ex\r\nparte Watkins</em>, 73 S.W.3d 264, 267 (Tex.Cr.App. 2002) (collateral estoppel bars relitigation of\r\n\"specific and discrete facts that have been fully and fairly adjudicated\"); <em>Johnston v. American\r\nMedical International</em>, 36 S.W.3d 572, 576 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2000, no writ) (collateral estoppel bars\r\nrelitigation of facts that were fully and fairly adjudicated and essential to the judgment in the first\r\naction).  For these reasons, this Court's 1992 opinion granting applicant habeas corpus relief also is\r\nnot dispositive of whether applicant is mentally retarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat the issue of applicant's mental retardation was not essential to the habeas court's\r\ndeterminations in the 1988 habeas proceeding is underscored by the habeas court's recommendation\r\nto deny habeas corpus relief despite its finding that applicant is \"mildly\" mentally retarded.  The\r\nissue of applicant's mental retardation was not fully and fairly adjudicated until applicant's 1992\r\nretrial.  There the State litigated this issue with its own expert who is the only psychologist to express\r\nan opinion on applicant's mental retardation based on the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13)\r\ndefinitions of mental retardation that this Court adopted in <em>Briseno</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhat this case really boils down to is whether this Court should stand in the way of the\r\nbargain the parties made in this habeas proceeding.  At this point in the judicial process of this 20-year-old case, I do not believe that this Court has (or should exercise) the power to effectuate this\r\nbargain through the vehicle of a mental retardation claim which the record does not support.  Just\r\nas executing a truly mentally retarded person would not advance any \"evolving standards of decency\r\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society,\" allowing the parties to use a mental retardation claim\r\nnot supported by the record as a bargaining chip to dispose of this case would not advance any\r\nevolving standards of decency either.   <em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2247.  On the contrary, effectuating\r\nthis bargain based on an unsubstantiated mental retardation claim would promote a sort of\r\n\"devolving standard of decency\" that marks a society indifferent to the dignity of the victim whom\r\napplicant so brutally murdered.  <em>Cf.

Applicant did not testify at his 1992 retrial.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his direct appeal from his 1992 capital murder conviction, applicant claimed (in grounds\r\n14 and 15) that his lawyer from his 1985 trial was ineffective for permitting applicant to testify at\r\nthe 1985 trial apparently because this testimony seriously undermined applicant's mental retardation\r\nclaim at his 1992 retrial.  In his brief, applicant argued that his \"[1985] trial testimony was inherently\r\ndamaging to [applicant], and when considering the expert testimony referred to in another ground\r\nof error, the decision by [applicant's lawyer from the 1985 trial] cannot be viewed in the context of\r\nstrategy.\"  This Court rejected this claim on direct appeal.  <em>See Moddon v.

Remember how he was able to burn his shirt. \r\nRemember how he was brought in and questioned by the police officers, and\r\nremember how he was able to artfully dodge their questions such that he was not\r\ncaught until some months later.\r\n<p>15. \tThis finding actually states that applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded.\"\r\n</p><p>16. \t<em>Ex parte Modden</em>, slip op. at 2 (Tex.Cr.App. No. 71,312, delivered February 12, 1992).\r\n</p><p>17. \tTo effectuate their bargain, the parties may have the remedy of seeking executive clemency\r\nfor applicant conditioned upon applicant fulfilling his part of the bargain.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Virginia</em>, the United States Supreme Court decided that the Eighth Amendment's\r\n\"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\" prohibit executing\r\nmentally retarded people.  <em>See Atkins v. Virginia</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Health &amp; Safety Code §\r\n591.003(13), and some other evidentiary factors in addressing <em>Atkins</em> mental retardation claims.  <em>See\r\nEx</em> <em>parte Briseno</em>, S.W.3d slip op. at 8-9, 11-12 (Tex.Cr.App. No. 29,819-03, delivered\r\nFebruary 11, 2004) (mental retardation means \"significant subaverage general intellectual\r\nfunctioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates during the\r\ndevelopmental period\").<sup> (1)</sup>  We also stated in <em>Briseno</em> that \"the ultimate issue of whether [a] person\r\nis, in fact, mentally retarded for purposes of the Eighth Amendment ban on excessive punishment\r\nis one for the finder of fact, based upon all of the evidence and determinations of credibility.\"  <em>See\r\nBriseno</em>, slip op. at 12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis latter statement, however, does not quite apply to this habeas proceeding for several\r\nreasons.  The record in this habeas proceeding reflects that, in exchange for applicant's guilty plea\r\nto several criminal offenses, the State agreed to a commutation of applicant's death sentence to a life\r\nsentence contingent on acceptance by the habeas court and this Court, of the parties' agreed finding\r\nand agreed evidence that applicant is mentally retarded.  The State reserved \"the right to oppose a\r\nfinding of mental retardation\" if this agreement cannot be fulfilled.  In relevant part, this agreement,\r\nin the form of a letter from the State to applicant's lawyer, states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is anticipated, understood, and expected that once your client [applicant] has plead\r\nguilty to the above five (5) offenses, and the same day and at the same proceeding in\r\nwhich your client pleads, <strong>and only in the event that your client pleads to the\r\nabove, the state will agree and stipulate that your client is mentally retarded</strong> and\r\nthat the state and yourself will present the [habeas court] with Agreed Findings of\r\nFact and Conclusions of Law, along with <strong>agreed evidence</strong> of your client's mental\r\nretardation to that end.  The state will further agree and request that your client's\r\nsentence of death be commuted to life.  The parties hereto further understand and\r\nstipulate that this agreement is contingent upon [the habeas court's] acceptance of\r\nAgreed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the Court of Criminal Appeals'\r\nadoption of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that find [applicant] to be\r\nmentally retarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn the event that [applicant] does not plead guilty to the above referenced offenses or\r\nin the event [the habeas court] or the Court of Criminal Appeals does not accept or\r\nadopt the Agreed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, <strong>the state reserves the\r\nright to oppose a finding of mental retardation</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe agreed evidence between the State and applicant consists of Kartye's 1985, Brownlee's\r\n1988, and Clark's 1992 psychological evaluations of applicant which are discussed in the Court's\r\nopinion.  <em>See Ex parte Modden</em>, S.W.3d slip op. at 5-7 (Tex.Cr.App. No. 74,715, delivered this\r\ndate).  Without hearing any live testimony, the habeas court apparently accepted these psychological\r\nevaluations and signed off on the parties' agreed finding that applicant is mentally retarded.  This\r\nfinding tracks the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.  <em>See\r\nBriseno</em>, slip op. at 8-9, 11-12.  But, none of these psychological evaluations state that they are based\r\non the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.  And, neither Kartye,\r\nBrownlee nor Clark have ever testified that their psychological evaluations and opinions are based\r\non the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe agreed finding in this habeas proceeding that applicant is mentally retarded also is not\r\nthe result of \"determinations of credibility\" at an adversarial live hearing meant to test the truth of\r\napplicant's mental retardation claim.  More important, the parties' agreed evidence does not take into\r\naccount all of the evidence pertinent to applicant's claim of mental retardation from applicant's 1985\r\ntrial and his 1992 retrial.  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 12 (mental retardation determination must be based\r\nupon all of the evidence).  For example, the parties litigated applicant's mental retardation claim in\r\nan adversarial setting before a jury at applicant's 1992 retrial where the State presented its own\r\npsychological expert who testified that applicant is not mentally retarded.<sup> (2)</sup>  It is fairly obvious from\r\nexamining the 1992 record from applicant's 1992 retrial that the jury rejected applicant's claim that\r\nhe is mentally retarded.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See Ex parte Taylor</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1634398\"><a href=\"/opinion/1634398/ex-parte-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 440-45 (Tex.Cr.App. 2002)\r\n(determining from an examination of the record what a jury found by a general not guilty verdict). \r\n<em>Briseno</em>, therefore, does not require this Court to accept the agreed finding that applicant is mentally\r\nretarded based on Kartye's 1985, Brownlee's 1988, and Clark's 1992 psychological evaluations of\r\napplicant.  This is not to say that these evaluations are irrelevant, but they should be considered with\r\nall of the other relevant evidence that completes the inquiry into applicant's claim of mental\r\nretardation.<sup> (4)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOverwhelming evidence was presented at applicant's 1985 and 1992 trials that applicant\r\nmeets very few, if any, of the <em>Briseno</em> factors and that applicant is nothing like Steinbeck's childlike\r\nLennie.<sup> (5)</sup>  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 8, 12.  This evidence indicates that applicant has been a violent\r\ncriminal for most of his adult life.  Though the evidence does indicate that applicant may have\r\nlimited intellectual capabilities, it also indicates that no one considered applicant to be mentally\r\nretarded while he was growing up and that upon reaching adulthood applicant has been able to take\r\ncare of himself both in and out of prison where (even before he committed this capital offense in\r\n1984) he spent a good part of his adult life.  The thrust of his mental deficiency evidence at both his\r\n1985 and 1992 trials is that applicant's mental deficiencies cause him to have poor impulse control\r\nand to be influenced by others for their own means, and that all of this is exacerbated by applicant's\r\nfrequent use of alcohol.  But the evidence shows that many of the criminal offenses that applicant\r\nhas committed during his life were planned and carried out all by himself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence also indicates that applicant might even possess some leadership qualities.  For\r\nexample, a September 6, 1982, prison disciplinary report indicates that applicant was placed in\r\nAdministrative Segregation for inciting other inmates not to perform their work duties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn September 6, 1982, at approximately 3:15 P.M., I noticed that the trays in both\r\nthe North and South Dishrooms were stacking up and not being washed.  I then\r\nentered the dishroom and found that all of the inmates assigned to the Dishroom were\r\nrefusing to wash any of the trays.  These inmates were [applicant and five others]. \r\nThese inmates stated that they were refusing to wash any dishes because they could\r\nnot get any ice water in the Dishroom. [Applicant] was placed in Administrative\r\nSegregation in order to prevent the inciting of further work stoppages and to prevent\r\nthe disruption of unit procedures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence also indicates that applicant is capable of responding \"coherently, rationally\r\nand on point to oral or written questions.\"  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 12.  For example, an October 5,\r\n1982, prison disciplinary report states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn October 5, 1982, at approximately 2:20 P.M. while A/L work force was cutting\r\nweeds, [applicant] was overheard to say \"Fuck the boss and old motor mouth too.\" \r\nUpon questioning [applicant] he again stated \"Fuck you and the Captain because\r\nyou'll [sic] ain't going to fuck with me.\"  I told [applicant] to go to work and he\r\nreplied \"If I get a case, I am not going to work and I am going to sue your ass.[\"]\r\n[Applicant] was placed in adminsstrative [sic] segregation in order to prevent a\r\ndisruption of unit procedures.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe record further indicates that applicant presented no evidence at his 1985 trial that he was\r\nmentally retarded.  Kartye's 1985 psychological evaluation, which was admitted into evidence at that\r\ntrial, does not conclude that applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded.\"<sup> (6)</sup>  And, Kartye never testified at\r\napplicant's 1985 trial that applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded.\"  Kartye never even used the term\r\n\"mental retardation\" at applicant's 1985 trial.  Kartye testified that applicant's \"limited intellectual\r\nresources\" caused him to have \"impulse control problems\" but that applicant was also capable of\r\nacting deliberately.<sup> (7)</sup>  It is also significant that applicant filed a coherent <em>pro se</em> brief on direct appeal\r\nfrom his 1985 capital murder conviction.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant did claim that he was mentally retarded at his 1992 retrial after the United States\r\nSupreme Court had decided <em>Penry v. Lynaugh</em> which held that the then-existing Texas special issues\r\nframework failed to provide Penry's jury with a vehicle to give mitigating effect to relevant\r\nmitigating evidence of Penry's severe mental retardation.<sup> (9)</sup>  Two psychological evaluations of\r\napplicant (Brownlee's 1988 evaluation and Clark's 1992 evaluation), concluding for the first time\r\nthat applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded,\"<sup> (10)</sup> were admitted into evidence at applicant's 1992 retrial. \r\nBefore this no one had ever previously noticed applicant's mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBrownlee did not testify at applicant's 1992 retrial.  According to Brownlee's 1988\r\nevaluation, applicant, unlike Steinbeck's Lennie, enjoys torturing animals.  This evaluation, among\r\nother things, states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[Applicant] said that he tortured animals often, either by burning them or hanging\r\nthem.  Upon exploration of the feelings associated with that, he had no affective\r\nstatement, but he said he did like to see them suffer and squirm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tClark testified at applicant's 1992 retrial.  Among other things, she testified that she would\r\nplace applicant \"somewhere as far as functioning in the lower three to five percent of the\r\npopulation,\" meaning apparently that, according to Clark, three to five percent of the population is\r\n\"mildly mentally retarded\" which interestingly is about three to five times more than that claimed\r\nby the defense expert in <em>Atkins</em>.  <em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2245 n.5 (forensic defense psychologist\r\ntestified that mental retardation is \"a relatively rare thing\" affecting \"about one percent of the\r\npopulation\").  The State commented on this during closing jury arguments:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNow, let's talk about psychologists a little bit.  Dr. Frankie Clark came up here, and\r\nI think she testified as to her honest opinion.  She says he's retarded.  She says about\r\n50 people out of 1,000 would be about in the same boat as the Defendant.  So if there\r\nare 30,000 people in our town, about 1,500 are in the same boat as Willie Mack\r\nModden.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State presented its own psychological expert at applicant's 1992 retrial.  This is the only\r\npsychological expert to testify on the issue of applicant's mental retardation based on the AAMR and\r\nthe Section 591.003(13) definitions of mental retardation.  Mostly through the use of supported-by-the-evidence hypotheticals, the State's psychological expert testified at applicant's 1992 retrial that\r\napplicant is not mentally retarded under the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13) definitions of\r\nmental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, Dr. Quijano, you know that one of the things in controversy in this\r\ntrial is the issue of mental retardation.  Could you tell the jury, please, sir, what is\r\nmental retardation?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Mental retardation is a condition of an individual that has to meet three criteria,\r\nand all three must be met before the label of mental retardation can be legitimately\r\ngiven.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tNumber 1, the individual must have a subaverage or below-average intellectual\r\nfunctioning as measured by an individually administered intellectual test, intelligence\r\ntest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tNumber 2, which is very important, and that is, the individual must have an adaptive\r\ndaily functioning skill that's below average and that would require constant\r\nsupervision.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tNumber 3, that these two deficits, the intellectual as well as the adaptive deficits,\r\nmust occur before age 18 to rule out victims of stroke and accidents with brain\r\ntrauma.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, doctor, you mentioned functioning skills and adaptive behavior. \r\nWhat sort of things are you talking about?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. By adaptive skills, we mean the skills needed by an individual to live on a day-to-day basis.  And those are-the questions asked are as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAre they able to take care of their own personal hygiene?  Can they eat without\r\nassistance?  Can they recognize hunger?  Can they procure food for themselves?  Can\r\nthey cook simple meals?  Can they recognize danger in that you don't cross the street\r\nwhen a big truck is coming your way?  Can they go to a store and negotiate a\r\npurchase?  Can they know if they're being cheated by somebody else?  Can they take\r\nmedicine when they are told to or when they need to?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAll of these things are considered adaptive skills, or some people call them daily\r\nskills of daily living. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Dr. Quijano, let me ask you this.  Assume, please, sir, that the person-the\r\nDefendant that we're concerned with here today, Willie Mack Modden-assume that\r\nthere is evidence that the Defendant is able to play dominoes, to keep score; assume\r\nthat he is able to play chess.  Assume that he is able to play basketball.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAssume that he is able to order materials and construct jewelry boxes out of\r\nmatchsticks with designs.  And assume that he is able to negotiate to sell those to\r\npeople.  Assume that he says, hey, buy this for your girl friend; I know you've got a\r\ngirl friend or somebody you want to give this to; hey, will you give me $15; you\r\nwon't do that; will you give me 12.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAssume, doctor, that we're dealing with an individual who, by himself, stashed a gun\r\nand kept it for some period of time and until he needed it; then he went and got the\r\ngun, and he went and hid in some bushes outside of a convenience store.  And he\r\nwaited until near closing time, and he waited until the lady took the trash out.  And\r\nhe pulled the gun on her, and he made her go back in the store.  And he made her\r\ngive him the money.  And then assume, doctor, that he made the woman pull her\r\nclothes off so that she would have to re-dress to avoid embarrassment before she\r\nsummoned help to give him more time to get away.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAssume, doctor, that this person, when they were incarcerated in TDC, learned the\r\nrules and regulations of the Texas Department of Corrections.  And assume that if a\r\nguard did something that he didn't approve of or that he felt was against the rules,\r\nthat he would summon another guard.  And if that guard was not able to answer his\r\nquestion, assume, doctor, that he would summon the supervisor, such as the sergeant,\r\nand that he would verbalize his complaint and say: this is against the rules; that man\r\ncan't do that to me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnd assume, doctor, that this person were incarcerated in jail.  And assume that they\r\ndecided that they wanted to escape.  And assume that they got with other inmates,\r\nand assume that they battered a hole in the wall.  And assume that the Defendant\r\nsaid, I'm going to get out, and I'm going to burn down the courthouse so there won't\r\nbe records on me.  And assume, doctor, that this person said, I'm then going to go kill\r\nthe people that helped put me in the penitentiary in the first place.[<sup> (11)</sup>]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnd assume, doctor, that this person were [sic] offended by somebody.  Assume\r\nsomebody hit this person when they were in the penitentiary.  And assume that they\r\nprocured razor blades, and assume that they melted them into the handle of a\r\ntoothbrush.  And assume that they waited until the next day when the offending\r\nperson was in the shower and had their face lathered up.  And assume that this person\r\nthen went in and cut that person's throat.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tDoctor, are these things consistent with a mentally retarded person?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. No, they are not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Can you tell me why they're not?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. The hallmark of a mentally retarded person is simplicity of thinking; that they can\r\nmaybe handle one thing at a time, maybe two.  The mentally retarded people used to\r\nbe called the simpleminded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThese behaviors that you have described are very complex behaviors.  They require\r\nmultiple steps in the mind.  They require that you-that you keep four or five, six\r\ndifferent things in mind and then manipulate them intellectually and mentally.  Those\r\nare complex acts.  The planning, the forethought, the anticipation of consequences,\r\nthe thinking on the feet; all of those are complex mental activities that a true mentally\r\nretarded person, by definition, cannot do.[<sup> (12)</sup>]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis expert also provided several explanations on why applicant's IQ test scores contained\r\nin his penitentiary records ranged from 57 to 83 before he got into this current trouble.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, in this record where it shows the Defendant's age of 18, which is\r\nmarked as State's Exhibit 26, it shows an IQ score of 57?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. That's correct. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Now, in this record, which is State's Exhibit Number 28, and it shows the\r\nDefendant's age as 26.  What IQ score does it show?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. It shows 83.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Now, I will-these records are here, doctor, if you need to look at them further to\r\nexplain that; but I'd like to discuss that with the jury and-how do you account or can\r\nyou account, sir, for the wide range in variations of IQ scores in the 57 range all the\r\nway up to 83.  What's the deal?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Okay.  The-given this information, if I were asked to account for that-assuming\r\nthat the tests were administered properly, and the only thing has changed would be\r\nthe motivation of the person taking the test.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIf you are tested before your trial, it is to your best interests to test down.  If you are\r\ntested after the trial, once you're in prison where you may be wanting a better job\r\nassignment, where you may be wanting to go to school, or where you may be wanting\r\na more free living arrangement-the better you are off, the better your chances are\r\nbecause if you are retarded in a prison, then your movements are limited.  You're\r\nsupervised more.  You cannot get good jobs and so on and so forth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSo one possibility is that you are now-you are no longer playing to the problem of\r\nfacing charges; that is all behind you, and you are testing better and maybe more\r\naccurately.  However, there are prisoners who would say, I tested down, because\r\nthese people may want to be assigned to Beto I, which is closer to their home, and\r\nthat is where the mentally retarded program is; and you test down.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOr you may want to have other programs available for the mentally retarded that that\r\nis not available for general population.  And people do that all the time.  They get to\r\nthe MR program; and they say, well, this is not what I expected; give me another test. \r\nAnd they test higher, and we kick them out.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Dr. Quijano, let me ask you this.  I believe that the test where the IQ score is 83\r\nshows an interview on September the 10<sup>th</sup>, 1974.  Now, would there be any change-is\r\nthere any reason for a person to change their attitude toward testing between 1974\r\nand now in the penitentiary system to your knowledge?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Could you explain that to the jury, please, sir?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Before 1984, when I went back to the system to implement the federal court\r\norders, there was no specialized program for the mentally retarded, and there was no\r\nspecial arrangement for them.  You were essentially treated by the system the way the\r\nsystem thought mentally retarded people should be treated.  And the motivation at\r\nthat time was to test up because you have to compete with other inmates for better\r\njobs.  These days there is less motivation for that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe motivation now, depending on what you want, is to test down because you have\r\na richer environment in a specialized program.  Our mentally retarded program is a\r\nvery expensive program because you have case managers and music therapy and\r\noccupational therapy.  You have your own gymnasium.  You have your own schools. \r\nIt's a lot richer program.  You have basic janitorial skills training and job programs. \r\nSo the motivation has shifted in the prison, depending on what you want to\r\naccomplish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis expert also testified that a person cannot fake a higher IQ score \"because you either\r\nknow the answer or you don't.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. I've got a couple of things, Dr. Quijano, that I want you to look at.  I'm going to\r\ntry to be brief on this.  This is Dr. Clark's report, I believe.  And we've got Dr.\r\nKartye's test here.  And this, I believe, is a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Brownlee. \r\nOkay?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, I want to talk about the two tests which have scores on them.  Now, doctor, I'll\r\nask you to-well, there's a date on this.  We don't have to assume anything. \r\nExamined 1-26-1985; examination, 7-11-92.  Now, you mentioned performance IQ. \r\nAnd I believe that Dr. Kartye's report reflects a performance IQ of 74, and Dr.\r\nClark's report reflects a performance IQ of 65.  Is this, the more recent test, lower?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. What-how do you square that up?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Well, two possibilities.  The most recent test is more suspect than the previous\r\ntest for two reasons.  Number one, a person cannot fake correct answers because, if\r\nyou give the correct answers, you obviously know the correct answers.  So it is-if\r\nyou score high-if you're asked questions, and you gave the answers, you obviously\r\nknow at this level.  It is much easier to say, I don't know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIt's easier to fake lower scores than to fake higher scores.  You cannot fake higher\r\nscores because you either know the answer or you don't.  You can fake a lower score\r\nby saying, I don't know, or if you don't have enough motivation to complete the test,\r\nor if you're not trying too hard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe second possibility in which our profession is warned against is testing when one\r\nis in trouble.  You must always suspect what we call malingering; that is, an\r\nexaggeration of symptoms when one is in trouble because of our human nature to\r\nprotect ourselves.  And so these scores can be explained by those two possibilities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State's expert also testified that his opinion about applicant's mental capacity was based\r\nin part on applicant's prison records before he got into this current trouble and that any testing of\r\napplicant after he got into this trouble would be of no benefit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  Do you have sufficient information at your disposal to form an opinion\r\nabout him and his mental capacity?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.  And you have how many years' worth of penitentiary records?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. The Defendant's records?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Not mine.  Okay.  Four tenures in TDC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Okay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. I don't know the exact number of years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And, doctor, do you have at your disposal the test results of other psychologists?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Would it be of benefit to you to be able to test the Defendant?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. At this late stage it would not be of benefit to me or anybody to test him because\r\nof the motivation factor.  A person that's in trouble-and the answers are now\r\nquestionable, and we can repeat this over and over again, and we'll get different test\r\nresults, depending on what the situation is.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe best evidence that applicant is not mentally retarded came from applicant himself when\r\nhe testified at his 1985 trial.<sup> (13)</sup>  Applicant testified at the punishment phase of his 1985 trial how he\r\nrobbed a convenience store clerk and stabbed her 16 times in the face and neck while she begged for\r\nher life and implored applicant to consider her three children. Applicant later, matter-of-factly,\r\ndescribed to several friends how he murdered the sobbing and terrified victim.  Applicant testified\r\nthat he decided to kill the victim before he actually killed her (meaning that he \"deliberately\" killed\r\nher).  He testified that he killed the victim because he did not want to leave any witnesses. \r\nApplicant's testimony from the punishment phase of this trial also indicates that after the crime\r\napplicant was smart enough to destroy evidence and to \"artfully dodge\" police questioning about his\r\ninvolvement in the crime.<sup> (14)</sup>  Applicant also testified about his plan to take a hostage and escape from\r\nthe county jail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State's psychological expert testified at applicant's 1992 retrial that, in forming opinions\r\nabout a person's mental ability, it is also important \"to look at what the person actually does\" and\r\nnot to make judgments \"about a person's character on the basis of test results only.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Doctor, is it possible to look at what someone actually does and use that as a basis\r\nfor an opinion as to that person's mental ability or that person's future behavior, just\r\nas you could use test results?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Well, it's more important to look at what the person actually does.  And it is not\r\nprofessional or ethical to make a judgment about a person's character on the basis of\r\ntest results only.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tResponding to Kartye's psychological testimony, the State argued during closing jury\r\narguments at applicant's 1985 trial:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThen you have to go toward the glimmer of hope that you can get somebody\r\nsidetracked on some collateral issue.  As it turned out, it was totally insignificant in\r\nanswering those two questions.  And that is when in desperation, Joe Kartye was\r\ncalled to testify.  You know, Joe Karty [sic].  I like Joe Karty [sic].  He's a likeable\r\ntype person.  I didn't agree with him on some things.  Some things I don't disagree\r\nwith him on.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tFor instance, the report that you have shows that [applicant] has a low I.Q. and he is\r\neasy led [sic] and he strikes out and he acts impulsively.  And I believe a lot of that. \r\nI don't think that he is the most intelligent person in the world, but I think he is\r\nsmarter than Mr. Kartye gives him credit for being.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnd you saw him on the witness stand.  On direct examination and cross examination\r\nand on many occasions he corrected what his attorney said.  He would back up and\r\nre-phrase what I said or whatever the situation was.  This man is very alert as to what\r\nwas going on, and he knows the consequences of what he was doing, and that is why\r\nwe are here today on the issues of deliberate and probability.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConsidered in its entirety, the record does not support the habeas court's finding that\r\napplicant is mentally retarded.  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 18 -19 (this Court's review of a trial court's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law on a mental retardation claim \"remains the same as it has\r\nalways been on habeas corpus applications,\" and this Court may reject the habeas court's findings\r\nthat the record does not support).  The evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding that applicant\r\nis not mentally retarded, and the contrary opinions of applicant's psychological experts can politely\r\nbe described as \"incredulous as a matter of law.\"  <em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2246 (noting that the\r\ndissenters in the Virginia Supreme Court rejected the state's expert opinion that Atkins possesses\r\naverage intelligence as \"incredulous as a matter of law\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Court's opinion makes much of the habeas court's pre-<em>Penry</em> finding from a 1988 habeas\r\nproceeding that applicant is  \"mentally retarded\"<sup> (15)</sup> and of this Court's 1992 opinion from that\r\nproceeding deciding that applicant's \"evidence of mental retardation\" entitled him to a new trial\r\nunder <em>Penry</em>.<sup> (16)</sup>  The record does indeed reflect that in 1988 applicant filed a habeas corpus\r\napplication claiming, among many other things, that the execution of a mentally retarded person\r\nwould violate the Eighth Amendment and that this very issue was then pending in the United States\r\nSupreme Court in <em>Penry</em>.  The record also reflects that the habeas court conducted a hearing on this\r\nhabeas corpus application in November 1988.  At this hearing Kartye testified on behalf of the State. \r\nKartye actually used the term and, testified for the first time that applicant was suffering from, \"mild\r\nmental retardation.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: Dr. Kartye, you're the same Dr. Kartye who previously examined\r\n[applicant], were you not?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. According to your examination, did you make a determination as to his level of\r\nintelligence?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I did.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And do you recall what that was?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Mild mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tKartye also testified on direct examination that applicant was capable of acting\r\n\"deliberately.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: From having examined [applicant], Doctor, I would ask if whether or\r\nnot you feel he could ever act deliberately?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: Yes, I feel that he can.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross-examination, Kartye testified that applicant could adequately function outside an\r\ninstitutional environment but not without endangering himself or others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [DEFENSE]: Dr. Kartye, in the report that you provided during the trial of this\r\ncase in 1985, you stated and I quote, \"It would appear that [applicant] lacks cognitive\r\nand behavioral controls necessary to effectively regulate his behavior.\"  Do you recall\r\nthat statement?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Do you believe that that's the truth?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And with regard to your testimony here this morning, did I understand you to state\r\ncorrectly that most mildly retarded persons can function adequately outside an\r\ninstitutional environment?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, they can.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Do you believe that [applicant] can?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. He has functioned outside the environment all his life until he was arrested.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. You're aware of his criminal record, aren't you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tQ. Do you think he could function outside a structured environment without endangering\r\nhimself or others?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. No.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOn re-direct examination, Kartye testified that applicant's inability to function outside of a\r\nstructured environment without hurting other people was because of his past criminal history and\r\nnot because of his degree of mental retardation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: Dr. Kartye, just one question.  You said a minute ago that, in your\r\nopinion, [applicant] could not function outside-in society without doing harm to\r\nhimself or others; is that correct?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [KARTYE]: That is correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. Is that based-do you base that opinion on his degree of mental retardation or his\r\npast criminal history?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. His past criminal history.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBrownlee testified at the November 1988 habeas hearing on applicant's behalf.  Brownlee\r\ntestified that applicant is mentally retarded which causes applicant not to have the intellectual\r\ncapability to act \"deliberately\" or \"intentionally\" or of being \"sane.\"  For example, Brownlee\r\ntestified how applicant's mental retardation causes applicant not to have the intellectual capability\r\nto be \"sane\" in the sense of knowing the difference between right and wrong and that for applicant\r\n\"hurting another person would be like soiling his pants.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [STATE]: Why do-why would he try to hide his wrong if he didn't know the\r\ndifference?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [BROWNLEE]: Because there's a higher level of wrong that we imply to being\r\ncaught in doing something bad.  You know, there is a certain degree of shame at\r\nmessing your pants, and I'm sure that, you know, [applicant] would have that shame\r\nif he soiled his pants.  And in his mind hurting another person would be like soiling\r\nhis pants.  It's a thing that causes shame, but it's not something that you feel so bad\r\nabout because you understand the long-term implications of death, that you\r\nunderstand the impact on other people.  Like he told me in my interview, he made\r\n[the victim] go to Heaven, and people should be happy about that.  That's an absurd\r\nassumption for a person who has a higher degree of intelligence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. So you really think that he thinks he did nothing wrong, and they should be happy\r\nbecause he made her go to Heaven?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. That's what he told me, yeah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBrownlee also testified that Kartye's psychological report was \"insufficient to help [him] in\r\nany way.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [DEFENSE]: Referring you back to Dr. Kartye's report, based on your knowledge\r\nand experience as a psychiatrist, do you have an opinion as to the overall quality of\r\nhis examination of [applicant]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [BROWNLEE]: If this was a report prepared by a psychologist that I would\r\nask-I'd have him redo it because it's insufficient to help me in any way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State also presented several police witnesses who testified that, during their numerous\r\ninteractions with applicant prior to his 1985 trial, they did not notice applicant's  mental retardation. \r\nOne of these witnesses apparently surprised the defense when he testified that he has \"personal\r\nknowledge of how a mentally retarded person might\" act.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. [DEFENSE]: Have you had experience before in your work with mentally\r\nretarded defendants?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. [MORRIS]: Would you-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  Have you ever-in the course of your investigation as an officer of the Department\r\nof Public Safety, have you ever dealt with mentally retarded defendants?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Not that I know of, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. So you don't-you don't have any personal knowledge of how a mentally retarded\r\nperson might interact with you as opposed to a person of normal intelligence?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. Yes, I do.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And what is that based on?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. I have a son that's [sic] mentally retarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. But you've never dealt with any mentally retarded defendants?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. No, I have not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ. And you had no reason in your discussion with [applicant] to think that he was\r\nmentally retarded?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA. I do not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[DEFENSE]: Pass the witness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tTo the extent that the Court's opinion suggests that the habeas court's finding in the 1988\r\nhabeas proceeding that applicant is \"mildly\" mentally retarded is dispositive or collaterally estops\r\na consideration of all of the other evidence, it is significant to point out that the habeas court made\r\nthis finding before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Penry</em>.  This finding, therefore, was not\r\nessential to the habeas court's determinations in the 1988 habeas proceeding, and the State did not\r\nneed to fully and fairly adjudicate the issue of applicant's mental retardation at this time.  <em>Cf.

For these reasons, this Court's 1992 opinion granting applicant habeas corpus relief also is\r\nnot dispositive of whether applicant is mentally retarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat the issue of applicant's mental retardation was not essential to the habeas court's\r\ndeterminations in the 1988 habeas proceeding is underscored by the habeas court's recommendation\r\nto deny habeas corpus relief despite its finding that applicant is \"mildly\" mentally retarded.  The\r\nissue of applicant's mental retardation was not fully and fairly adjudicated until applicant's 1992\r\nretrial.  There the State litigated this issue with its own expert who is the only psychologist to express\r\nan opinion on applicant's mental retardation based on the AAMR and the Section 591.003(13)\r\ndefinitions of mental retardation that this Court adopted in <em>Briseno</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhat this case really boils down to is whether this Court should stand in the way of the\r\nbargain the parties made in this habeas proceeding.  At this point in the judicial process of this 20-year-old case, I do not believe that this Court has (or should exercise) the power to effectuate this\r\nbargain through the vehicle of a mental retardation claim which the record does not support.  Just\r\nas executing a truly mentally retarded person would not advance any \"evolving standards of decency\r\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society,\" allowing the parties to use a mental retardation claim\r\nnot supported by the record as a bargaining chip to dispose of this case would not advance any\r\nevolving standards of decency either.   <em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2247.  On the contrary, effectuating\r\nthis bargain based on an unsubstantiated mental retardation claim would promote a sort of\r\n\"devolving standard of decency\" that marks a society indifferent to the dignity of the victim whom\r\napplicant so brutally murdered.  <em>Cf. Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2247 (basic concept underlying Eighth\r\nAmendment jurisprudence \"is nothing less than the dignity of man\").<sup> (17)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI respectfully dissent. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHervey, J.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Filed: April 21, 2004</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Publish</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br>APPENDIX<br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n </p>\r\n<span>\r\n</span>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<p>1. \tSome of the other evidentiary factors adopted in <em>Briseno</em>, slip op. at 12, include:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage-his family,\r\nfriends, teachers, employers, authorities-think he was mentally retarded at that time,\r\nand, if so, act in accordance with that determination?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led around by others?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate, regardless\r\nof whether it is socially acceptable?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral or written questions\r\nor do his responses wander from subject to subject?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own or others' interests?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the capital murder, did\r\nthe commission of that offense require forethought, planning and complex execution\r\nor purpose? \r\n<p>2. \tThis testimony is not mentioned in either the habeas court's findings or this Court's opinion\r\ngranting applicant habeas corpus relief on his mental retardation claim.\r\n</p><p>3. \t<em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 6 (Holcomb, J., dissenting) (persons like applicant \"have the right to\r\na jury determination on the issue of mental retardation\").\r\n</p><p>4. \tIt could be argued that this Court should accept the parties' agreed finding and that the only\r\nevidence that this Court should consider is Kartye's 1985, Brownlee's 1988, and Clark's 1992\r\npsychological evaluations of applicant.  <em>Briseno</em>, however, says that the mental retardation\r\ndetermination must be based \"upon all of the evidence.\"  <em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 12.  And, here the\r\nagreed finding ignores other overwhelming evidence that applicant is not mentally retarded.  \r\n</p><p>5. \t<em>See Briseno</em>, slip op. at 8 citing John Steinbeck, Of Mice And Men (1937).\r\n</p><p>6. \tThe Court's opinion and the habeas court's findings incorrectly claim otherwise.  <em>See\r\nModden</em>, slip op. at 6 (stating that \"Kartye concluded that the applicant is mildly mentally retarded\").\r\n</p><p>7. \tKartye did testify, consistent with his 1985 report, that applicant's overall score on the\r\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale was 64 which is 5 points higher than Atkins' overall score of 59. \r\n<em>See Atkins</em>, 122 S.Ct. at 2245.\r\n</p><p>8. \tThe Court's opinion states that it is common knowledge that the prisons are full of \"writ\r\nwriters.\"  This may be so but it does not prove that a writ writer prepared applicant's brief for him.\r\n</p><p>9. \t<em>See Penry v. Lynaugh</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This testimony was\r\nintroduced at applicant's 1992 retrial.  Applicant did not testify at his 1992 retrial.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his direct appeal from his 1992 capital murder conviction, applicant claimed (in grounds\r\n14 and 15) that his lawyer from his 1985 trial was ineffective for permitting applicant to testify at\r\nthe 1985 trial apparently because this testimony seriously undermined applicant's mental retardation\r\nclaim at his 1992 retrial.  In his brief, applicant argued that his \"[1985] trial testimony was inherently\r\ndamaging to [applicant], and when considering the expert testimony referred to in another ground\r\nof error, the decision by [applicant's lawyer from the 1985 trial] cannot be viewed in the context of\r\nstrategy.\"  This Court rejected this claim on direct appeal.  <em>See Moddon v. State</em>, slip op. at 13-15\r\n(Tex.Cr.App. No. 71,493, delivered June 8, 1994) (nonpublished).\r\n<p>14. \tThe State commented on this during closing jury arguments at applicant's 1992 retrial:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBut I ask you to do this: When you think about the issue of intoxication, look at the\r\nactions of the Defendant and see what makes sense.  Look at how he was able to\r\nremember how many times he stabbed her.  Remember how he was able to pause and\r\nwatch when the police car drove by.  Remember how he was able to burn his shirt. \r\nRemember how he was brought in and questioned by the police officers, and\r\nremember how he was able to artfully dodge their questions such that he was not\r\ncaught until some months later.\r\n<p>15. \tThis finding actually states that applicant is \"mildly mentally retarded.\"\r\n</p><p>16. \t<em>Ex parte Modden</em>, slip op. at 2 (Tex.Cr.App. No. 71,312, delivered February 12, 1992).\r\n</p><p>17. \tTo effectuate their bargain, the parties may have the remedy of seeking executive clemency\r\nfor applicant conditioned upon applicant fulfilling his part of the bargain.</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
