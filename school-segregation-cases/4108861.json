(a)) in case\nNo. SS111917A and in case No. SS112093A. The trial court suspended imposition of\nsentence in each case and placed defendant on probation. While defendant was on\nprobation, Penal Code section 1170.181 was enacted by the voters as part of Proposition\n47, which reclassified certain offenses as misdemeanors. Defendant filed a petition in\neach case for recall of sentence and resentencing to a misdemeanor pursuant to\nsection 1170.18. The trial court denied the petitions after determining that defendant, as\na probationer, was not serving a sentence within the meaning of the statute.\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       On appeal defendant contends, among other arguments, that he is “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), and therefore\nthe trial court erred in denying his petitions. The Attorney General concedes that the trial\ncourt erred. We agree and reverse the orders denying defendant’s petitions.\n                 II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In 2011, defendant pleaded no contest to possession of a controlled substance\n(former Health & Saf. Code, § 11350, subd. (a)) in case No. SS111917A and in case\nNo. SS112093A. The trial court suspended imposition of sentence in each case and\nplaced defendant on Proposition 36 probation. (See § 1210.1.)\n       In July 2014, the trial court terminated defendant’s Proposition 36 probation in\neach case, suspended imposition of sentence, and placed him on formal probation for\nthree years.\n       In early 2015, after Proposition 47 had passed, defendant filed a petition\nrequesting that his felony convictions automatically be designated misdemeanors\npursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g). Defendant contended that he had\n“completed” his sentence in each case. The prosecution filed written responses arguing\nthat defendant was not eligible for the requested relief because he was not a “sentenced\nprisoner.” The record does not reflect whether the trial court ruled on this petition.\n       In March 2015, defendant filed a second petition in each case for recall of\nsentence and resentencing to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18,\nsubdivisions (b) and (d). In the petitions, defendant contended that he was “sentenced to”\nfelony probation and was “currently serving [that] sentence.”\n       The prosecution apparently continued to object on the grounds that defendant was\nnot eligible for relief because he was not currently serving a sentence within the meaning\nof section 1170.18.\n       The parties filed memoranda of points and authorities on the issue. Defendant\ncontended that, as a probationer, he was “currently serving a sentence” within the\n\n                                              2\n\fmeaning of section 1170.18, and that therefore he was entitled to have his convictions\nresentenced as misdemeanors under the statute. Defendant also filed a “non-statutory\nmotion to reduce both matters to misdemeanors by operation of law.”\n       The prosecution contended that defendant’s petitions were premature because he\nhad been placed on probation and was therefore not “currently serving a sentence” within\nthe meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n       On May 8, 2015, a hearing was held on defendant’s petitions. The trial court\nstated that, “in regard to the issue of whether a grant of felony probation constitutes a\nsentence, the Court finds under the traditional case law it does not.” The court denied\ndefendant’s petitions for recall and resentencing by written orders filed that same day.\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\n       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court’s order denying his petitions for\nrecall and resentencing as misdemeanors must be reversed. First, he argues that as a\nprobationer he is “currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (a), and therefore he is eligible to have his felony convictions resentenced as\nmisdemeanors. Second, he contends that denying relief under section 1170.18 to a\ndefendant granted probation rather than sentenced to prison or jail violates the equal\nprotection clauses of the federal and state Constitutions. Third, he argues that “[i]f this\ncourt agrees with the trial court that” he is not eligible for resentencing because he has\nnot yet been sentenced, then his “cases automatically became misdemeanors upon\npassage of [Proposition] 47.”\n       The Attorney General concedes that defendant, as a probationer, is “currently\nserving a sentence” and is therefore eligible to petition for relief under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (a). The Attorney General contends that defendant’s convictions do not\nautomatically become misdemeanors by retroactive application of Proposition 47.\n       We find the Attorney General’s concession that defendant is currently serving a\nsentence and is therefore eligible to petition for relief under section 1170.18,\n\n                                              3\n\fsubdivision (a) to be appropriate. In view of our conclusion, we do not reach the two\nother issues raised by defendant regarding (1) whether a different construction of the\nstatute violates the federal and state equal protection clauses, and (2) whether\nProposition 47 operates retroactively to automatically change his felony convictions to\nmisdemeanors.\n       A. Legal Background: Proposition 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act (the Act). (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\neff. Nov. 5, 2014.) Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug and theft related offenses as\nmisdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 308.) The statutes amended\nby Proposition 47 include Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a), the\nformer version of which provided the basis for defendant’s felony convictions. Prior to\nProposition 47, possession of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety\nCode section 11350, subdivision (a) was a felony. (People v. Rivera (2015) 233\nCal.App.4th 1085, 1092 (Rivera).) As a result of Proposition 47, Health and Safety Code\nsection 11350, subdivision (a) now provides that possession of specified controlled\nsubstances is punishable as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has certain disqualifying\nprior convictions.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a) provides for the following\npunishment: “imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, except that such\nperson shall instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the\nPenal Code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in\nclause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 of\nthe Penal Code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of\nSection 290 of the Penal Code.” Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists a number\nof serious or violent felonies, which have been referred to as “super strike” offenses.\n(See Rivera, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at p. 1092.)\n\n                                             4\n\f       Proposition 47 also enacted a new statutory provision, section 1170.18, which sets\nforth procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony conviction resentenced as or\ndesignated a misdemeanor. Relevant here, one of the procedures applies to a defendant\nwho is “currently serving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been\nguilty of a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the\noffense. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall\nof his or her sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute\nthat reclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       If the petitioner meets the requisite statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony\nsentence shall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the\ncourt, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b); see id., subd. (c).)\nSection 1170.18 sets forth various factors that a court may consider in exercising its\ndiscretion. (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3).) A defendant is not eligible for resentencing if he or she\nhas suffered a specified prior conviction. (Id., subd. (i).) Generally, a defendant who is\nresentenced pursuant to section 1170.18 is subject to a one-year period of parole and may\nnot possess a firearm. (Id., subds. (d) & (k).)\n       B. “Currently Serving a Sentence”\n       In People v. Garcia (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 555 (Garcia), we determined that the\nphrase “currently serving a sentence” in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), “appl[ies] to all\nthose with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet\nthe conditions specified in the statutory scheme.” (Garcia, supra, at p. 559.) In Garcia,\nthe trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the defendant on probation\nfor felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377,\nsubd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.)\n       We agreed with the parties in Garcia that interpreting the statutory language to\nnot include probationers would lead to absurd consequences. We observed that “there is\n\n                                               5\n\fnothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the\nphrase ‘currently serving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of\nimprisonment.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting\nprobation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing choice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the selection of any disposition of the case\nthat does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.’]). (Cf. People v.\nHoward (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1084 [referring to court’s authority ‘at time of\nsentencing’ either to suspend imposition of sentence or impose sentence and suspend its\nexecution]; In re DeLong (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 562, 571 [‘an order granting probation\nand suspending imposition of sentence is a form of sentencing’].)” (Ibid.) Indeed, “the\nlanguage of another voter initiative, Proposition 36, the Substance Abuse and Crime\nPrevention Act of 2000, used the language ‘sentenced to probation.’ (See People v.\nMendoza (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [quoting ballot pamphlet to distinguish\nconviction from sentence and referring to ‘sentence of probation’].)” (Ibid.)\n       We explained in Garcia that “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure; the legislative analysis refers to offenders who are ‘sentenced’ to supervision\nby a county probation officer while indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders\nand the caseloads of probation officers would be reduced by including felony probation\nas a disposition eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 310 [discussing Prop. 47 mechanism for resentencing after\nbeing ‘sentenced or placed on probation’].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\n\n                                              6\n\fprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, [Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014)]\ntext of Prop. 47, § 3, p. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       Accordingly, because section 1170.18 applies “to all those with felony\ndispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet the conditions\nspecified in the statutory scheme” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 559), defendant\nas a probationer in this case was entitled to consideration of his petitions for resentencing.\n                                    IV. DISPOSITION\n       The May 8, 2015 orders in case Nos. SS111917A and SS112093A are reversed,\nand the matters are remanded for consideration of defendant’s petitions under Penal Code\nsection 1170.18.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f                             ___________________________________________\n                             BAMATTRE-MANOUKIAN, J.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\nELIA, ACTING P.J.\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\nMIHARA, J.\n\n\n\n\nPeople v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308.) The statutes amended\nby Proposition 47 include Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a), the\nformer version of which provided the basis for defendant’s felony convictions. Prior to\nProposition 47, possession of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety\nCode section 11350, subdivision (a) was a felony. (People v. Rivera (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1092 (Rivera).) As a result of Proposition 47, Health and Safety Code\nsection 11350, subdivision (a) now provides that possession of specified controlled\nsubstances is punishable as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has certain disqualifying\nprior convictions.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a) provides for the following\npunishment: “imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, except that such\nperson shall instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the\nPenal Code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an offense specified in\nclause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 of\nthe Penal Code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of\nSection 290 of the Penal Code.” Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists a number\nof serious or violent felonies, which have been referred to as “super strike” offenses.\n(See Rivera, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at p. 1092.)\n\n                                             4\n\f       Proposition 47 also enacted a new statutory provision, section 1170.18, which sets\nforth procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony conviction resentenced as or\ndesignated a misdemeanor. Relevant here, one of the procedures applies to a defendant\nwho is “currently serving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been\nguilty of a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the\noffense. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall\nof his or her sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute\nthat reclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       If the petitioner meets the requisite statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony\nsentence shall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the\ncourt, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b); see id., subd. (c).)\nSection 1170.18 sets forth various factors that a court may consider in exercising its\ndiscretion. (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3).) A defendant is not eligible for resentencing if he or she\nhas suffered a specified prior conviction. (Id., subd. (i).) Generally, a defendant who is\nresentenced pursuant to section 1170.18 is subject to a one-year period of parole and may\nnot possess a firearm. (Id., subds. (d) & (k).)\n       B. “Currently Serving a Sentence”\n       In People v. Garcia (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Garcia), we determined that the\nphrase “currently serving a sentence” in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), “appl[ies] to all\nthose with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet\nthe conditions specified in the statutory scheme.” (Garcia, supra, at p. 559.) In Garcia,\nthe trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the defendant on probation\nfor felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377,\nsubd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.)\n       We agreed with the parties in Garcia that interpreting the statutory language to\nnot include probationers would lead to absurd consequences. We observed that “there is\n\n                                               5\n\fnothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the\nphrase ‘currently serving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of\nimprisonment.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting\nprobation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing choice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the selection of any disposition of the case\nthat does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.’]). (Cf. People v.\nHoward (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1124385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1124385/people-v-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084 [referring to court’s authority ‘at time of\nsentencing’ either to suspend imposition of sentence or impose sentence and suspend its\nexecution]; In re DeLong (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2282557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2282557/in-re-delong/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 [‘an order granting probation\nand suspending imposition of sentence is a form of sentencing’].)” (Ibid.) Indeed, “the\nlanguage of another voter initiative, Proposition 36, the Substance Abuse and Crime\nPrevention Act of 2000, used the language ‘sentenced to probation.’ (See People v.\nMendoza (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2261163\"><a href=\"/opinion/2261163/people-v-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1034 [quoting ballot pamphlet to distinguish\nconviction from sentence and referring to ‘sentence of probation’].)” (Ibid.)\n       We explained in Garcia that “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure; the legislative analysis refers to offenders who are ‘sentenced’ to supervision\nby a county probation officer while indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders\nand the caseloads of probation officers would be reduced by including felony probation\nas a disposition eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 [discussing Prop. 47 mechanism for resentencing after\nbeing ‘sentenced or placed on probation’].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\n\n                                              6\n\fprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, [Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014)]\ntext of Prop. 47, § 3, p. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       Accordingly, because section 1170.18 applies “to all those with felony\ndispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet the conditions\nspecified in the statutory scheme” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 559), defendant\nas a probationer in this case was entitled to consideration of his petitions for resentencing.\n                                    IV. DISPOSITION\n       The May 8, 2015 orders in case Nos. SS111917A and SS112093A are reversed,\nand the matters are remanded for consideration of defendant’s petitions under Penal Code\nsection 1170.18.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f                             ___________________________________________\n                             BAMATTRE-MANOUKIAN, J.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\nELIA, ACTING P.J.\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\nMIHARA, J.\n\n\n\n\nPeople v.
