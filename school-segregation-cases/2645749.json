Carlton (argued), Supervising Deputy Attorney\nGeneral, San Diego, California, for Respondent-Appellee.\n\n\n                               OPINION\n\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge:\n\n                           I. Introduction\n\n   In 1984, a house in California was burglarized and a\nnumber of items were stolen. K.H. and M.H. resided there\nwith M.H.’s young children, a live-in babysitter, L.R., and her\ndaughter. Petitioner John Doe,1 who was living at the time in\na vacant house adjacent to the property, was arrested in\nconnection with the burglary, but then released.\n\n    Soon after, while K.H. and M.H. were not at home, their\nhouse was burglarized again. L.R. was murdered, having been\nbeaten, stabbed, and strangled. Her body was found supine on\nthe bed in the master bedroom, with her hands bound behind\nher back. She was naked from the waist down, with her legs\nopen, and a vibrator near her body. A number of items were\nstolen.\n\n\n    1\n    In this case, we discuss disturbing evidence of sexual abuse suffered\nby the Petitioner. Because of the possibility that publication of this\ninformation might place him at risk in a prison environment, much of the\nrecord in this habeas proceeding was filed under seal. However, this case\nturns on the weight of the evidence that trial counsel failed to discover and\npresent; it is powerful in large part because of the painful details. After\nconsidering the views of the parties, we have ordered the record unsealed\nfor the limited purpose of discussing the evidence in this opinion, but have\nreplaced Petitioner’s name with Doe and the names of others with initials.\nWe have also omitted citations to the procedural history of this case.\n\f                              DOE V. AYERS                                     5\n\n    After an investigation, Doe was arrested. He was charged\nwith one count of murder and two counts of burglarizing the\nhome. Special circumstances of felony-murder-burglary and\nfelony-murder-rape were alleged; also alleged was a prior\nfelony conviction for an armed robbery committed in the\nSouthern state where Doe grew up. J.B., who had never\nbefore worked on a case in which the death penalty was at\nissue, was appointed to represent Doe.2 He hired an\ninvestigator, D.S., who interviewed potential witnesses in\nCalifornia and in Doe’s home state.3\n\n    Doe pleaded not guilty to the charges and denied the\nallegations. The jury returned verdicts finding Doe guilty of\nmurder and both counts of burglary. The jury also rendered\na finding of true on the felony-murder-burglary special-\ncircumstance allegation, and a finding of not true on the\nfelony-murder-rape special-circumstance allegation. At the\npenalty phase, the jury returned a sentence of death.4\n\n\n 2\n   J.B. also stated that he had “never observed the penalty phase of a trial\nor mock trial.”\n  3\n    For the sake of clarity, we include a brief timeline of Doe’s life and\ncriminal history. He grew up in the South. In 1976, at the age of 17, he\nwas convicted of robbery and incarcerated in a state prison. He was\nreleased in 1982. By 1983, Doe had moved to California; he was\nconvicted of murder there in 1984.\n 4\n   In California, a capital trial consists of two phases. In the first, the guilt\nphase, the jury decides whether the defendant committed murder and also\nwhether one of a number of special circumstances applies. If the jury\ndetermines that the defendant is guilty and that one of the special\ncircumstances applies in the case, a separate penalty phase commences.\nIn that phase, the jury weighs aggravating and mitigating evidence to\ndetermine whether the death penalty is appropriate. Tuilaepa v. California,\n512 U.S. 967, 969 (1994) (citing Cal. Penal Code § 190.3). The Supreme\n\f6                            DOE V. AYERS\n\n    The California Supreme Court denied Doe’s direct appeal,\nand the Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court also denied Doe’s habeas petition,\ntwice.\n\n    Doe filed a federal habeas petition, which was also\ndenied. The district court affirmed the conviction, rejecting a\nnumber of guilt-phase challenges. As for Doe’s claim that he\nhad received ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty\nphase of his trial, the court found that counsel for Doe had\nperformed deficiently in failing to investigate and present\nvarious categories of mitigating evidence. However, the\ndistrict court concluded that Doe could not establish that he\nhad been prejudiced as a result, as required under Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984).\n\n    We agree with the district court that Doe is not entitled to\nreversal of his conviction on the basis of the claims presented\nin the petition before us. With respect to the penalty-phase\nclaim, we agree that defense counsel was ineffective but\ndisagree with the conclusion that Doe was not prejudiced.\nAccordingly, we affirm Doe’s conviction but reverse as to his\nsentence, and instruct the district court to grant the writ.\n\n\n\n\nCourt has long recognized that such bifurcated trials serve an important\nrole in ensuring that “the determination of punishment [in capital cases]\n. . . reflect[s] ‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of\na maturing society[,]’” because “[m]uch of the information that is relevant\nto the sentencing decision may have no relevance to the question of guilt,\nor may even be extremely prejudicial to a fair determination of that\nquestion.” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 190 (1976) (citations omitted).\n\f                        DOE V. AYERS                          7\n\n                  II. Standard of Review\n\n     This case is unusual in that Doe filed his federal habeas\npetition in 1995, prior to the passage of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”).\nAccordingly, the parties agree that his petition is governed by\npre-AEDPA standards of review. See Comer v. Schriro,\n480 F.3d 960, 980 (9th Cir. 2007). “Under these standards\nstate court judgments of conviction and sentence carry a\npresumption of finality and legality and may be set aside only\nwhen a state prisoner carries his burden of proving that his\ndetention violates the fundamental liberties of the person,\nsafeguarded against state action by the Federal Constitution.”\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). “A state\ncourt’s conclusion that a constitutional error was harmless is\nreviewed de novo.” Daniels v. Woodford, 428 F.3d 1181,\n1196 (9th Cir. 2005). In this analysis, the additional deference\nrequired by AEDPA does not apply.\n\n    This court reviews de novo the district court’s denial of\nhabeas relief. See Alcala v. Woodford, 334 F.3d 862, 868 (9th\nCir. 2003). Underlying factual determinations made by the\ndistrict court are reviewed for clear error. See Hovey v. Ayers,\n458 F.3d 892, 900 (9th Cir. 2006). Determinations by the\ndistrict court of legal questions or mixed questions of law and\nfact are reviewed de novo. Frierson v. Woodford, 463 F.3d\n982, 988 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\n                  III. Guilt-Phase Claims\n\n    In the petition before us, Doe raises a number of\nchallenges to his conviction, all of which were rejected by the\ndistrict court. We discuss these claims only briefly, as we\nagree with the result reached by the district court.\n\f8                       DOE V. AYERS\n\n                        A. Rule 60(b)\n\n    First, Doe asserts that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying his motion to vacate the judgment in\nwhich it denied his habeas petition under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(b). Doe requested relief under Rule 60(b) based on newly\ndiscovered physical evidence that was in the possession of the\nstate. He alleges that the state withheld from his prior habeas\ncounsel DNA and fingerprint evidence from the crime scene\nand from a related murder that it tested post-trial and was not\na match to Doe. He also alleges that his prior habeas counsel\nwas negligent in failing to pursue claims based on this\nevidence once she learned of it.\n\n    Doe’s Rule 60(b) claims have a complicated procedural\nhistory:\n\n    In March 2005, while the present petition was still\npending before the district court, Doe sent a letter to the court\nstating that he no longer wanted his appointed attorneys to\ncontinue to represent him, in part because they refused to\ninvestigate his claims of actual innocence. Two weeks after\nhe reiterated that request in June, the district court denied\nDoe’s request, and simultaneously denied his habeas petition.\nDoe appealed the denial of his motion for substitution of\ncounsel, and we appointed new (present) habeas counsel, who\nfiled his Rule 60(b) motion; the district court denied it. After\nconsolidating Doe’s appeals, we held that the district court\nhad abused its discretion in denying Doe’s request for\nsubstitution of counsel. We vacated the district court’s denial\nof this request, together with its denial of Doe’s petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus, and remanded for further proceedings\nin which Doe’s newly-appointed counsel would have the\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                                9\n\nopportunity to make additional submissions to the district\ncourt.\n\n    The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed.5 It\nconcluded that we had erred in holding that the district court\nabused its discretion in rejecting Doe’s request for new\ncounsel. In so doing, it noted that the evidence at issue “might\nhave established a Brady claim, a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel for failure to adequately investigate the\nmurder, or a claim of innocence, especially given that no\nphysical evidence tied Doe to the crime and that he was\nconvicted based in part on recanted testimony. The Court\nwent on to say, however, that all of those claims would have\nbeen new, and that as the district court subsequently found in\nruling on the Rule 60(b) motion, the physical evidence was\nnot related to the claims previously presented in Doe’s habeas\npetition. Because these claims were new claims for relief on\nthe merits, and did not attack a defect in the integrity of the\nproceedings, Doe was required to raise them not in a Rule\n60(b) motion, but in a successive habeas petition. Gonzalez\nv. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 529–32 (2005).6 We therefore do not\nconsider them here, but may do so in the future if Doe is\n\n\n\n 5\n     Citation omitted.\n   6\n     We note that Doe may still timely bring such a petition, because he\nfiled – and we accepted as a protective petition under Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 416 (2005) – an application to file an\namended successor petition. Proceedings on that petition were stayed\npending resolution of this one; once the mandate issues in the case we now\nconsider, we will determine whether Doe’s successive petition makes a\nprima facie showing under the actual innocence prong of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2244(b)(2)(B). See Thompson v. Calderon, 151 F.3d 918, 923–25 (9th\nCir. 1998) (en banc).\n\f10                         DOE V. AYERS\n\nsubsequently granted the right to file a second or successive\npetition.\n\n            B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n     Second, Doe alleges that his trial counsel, J.B., provided\nineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of his\ntrial. J.B.’s performance at the guilt phase of Doe’s trial was\ncertainly subpar. He failed to interview two young children\nwho were the only eyewitnesses to the murder and who, in\ninitial police reports, identified the killer as white (Doe is\nblack). Although the failure to even interview the only\neyewitnesses to the crime was unquestionably deficient\nperformance, J.B. did offer a couple of reasonable\njustifications for his decision not to put them on as witnesses:\nthe children appeared unreliable, and the prosecutor agreed\nnot to tell the jury that children were present at the time of the\nmurder if J.B. did not call them to testify.7\n\n    J.B. also failed to follow up on a potential alibi witness,\nC.L., with whom Doe claimed that he had gone drinking the\nnight of the murder. During an interview with D.S., C.L. said\nthat it was more likely than not that Doe was with him at a\nlocal bar on the night of the murder, given that the murder\noccurred on a Thursday and C.L. and Doe always went out\ndrinking on Thursday nights. Because C.L. had no specific\nrecollection of that particular evening, he told D.S. that he\nwould attempt to find more definite support for the alibi. D.S.\nprovided J.B. with a copy of a report summarizing his\ninterview with C.L.; however, J.B. never attempted to contact\n\n\n  7\n    It also appears the J.B. may have wanted to avoid traumatizing the\nchildren, which would not have been a legitimate reason for deciding not\nto call them.\n\f                              DOE V. AYERS                         11\n\nC.L. again until, just before trial, when he tried to subpoena\nhim as a trial witness.8 Then, when service was initially\nunsuccessful, J.B. made no further attempt to track him down.\nJ.B. also acted in an objectively unreasonable way when he\nfailed to call a blood spatter expert who stated in his report\nthat had Doe committed the murder, he would have been\nspattered with blood. J.B. never asserted a strategic reason for\nnot calling the blood spatter expert, and the arguments raised\nby the state to undermine the probative value of this evidence\n(suggesting that Doe would have had time to wash the blood\noff, and that the witness who spent time with him later that\nevening did not see him in bright light) provide no reason not\nto present this testimony.\n\n    Additionally, Doe argues that J.B. failed to investigate\nand challenge the reliability of one of the state’s witnesses,\nP.F., a girlfriend-turned-informant who testified that she\nbumped into Doe the night of the murder, that he left her\nalone during the time the crime was committed, and that he\nreturned with a bit of blood on his hand and carrying\ndistinctive items stolen from the home in which L.R. was\nkilled. P.F. testified that he told her that he had “just finished\nbeating up a woman.” Later, she taped a conversation with\nDoe, during which he made inculpatory statements.\n\n    There was good reason to doubt the reliability of P.F.’s\ntestimony. Two women who knew her told D.S. that she had\na reputation for lying. However, neither D.S. nor J.B.\ninterviewed B.P., one of the two people P.F. said she had\nbeen walking with when she encountered Doe that evening.\nWhen contacted later by habeas counsel, B.P. contradicted\nP.F.’s story, stating convincingly that she knew she had not\n\n 8\n     J.B. never asserted a strategic reason for not calling C.L.\n\f12                     DOE V. AYERS\n\nbeen out with P.F. that night. P.F. had been in a bicycling\naccident shortly prior to the date of the crime, and a number\nof people stated in declarations that she had suffered from\nsignificant memory loss for months. P.F. essentially admitted\nin a declaration that, because she was still recovering from\nthe accident, she could not have been with Doe on the night\nof the murder. It also appears that she was suffering cognitive\ndeficits resulting from the combination of a medication and\nalcohol. Doe argues that in addition to impeaching P.F. based\non her reputation for dishonesty and cognitive deficits, J.B.\nshould have asked her about the extent to which the police\nappear to have helped her fill holes in her memory.\n\n     However, J.B. did impeach P.F. to a significant degree.\nHe elicited testimony about the seriousness of her head injury\nand the fact that she was taking medication and drinking\nalcohol on the night of the murder. He also elicited testimony\nthat she had previously made false statements. He\ndemonstrated that the moon was not full, as she had stated,\nthe night of the murder, and that items she claimed to have\nseen that night in the vacant house had been removed\npreviously. Finally, he prompted her to admit that she had not\ninitially remembered the date of her interaction with Doe, and\nthat the police had supplied her with it. We agree with the\ndistrict court that while J.B. could have done a much better\njob of impeaching P.F., his efforts in this respect were not\nconstitutionally inadequate. The additional impeachment\nevidence would have been largely cumulative, albeit stronger,\nbut the failures regarding impeachment of P.F. are of\ncomparatively little consequence, as the most important\nportion of her testimony was the introduction of her recorded\nconversation with Doe that served to corroborate the\ncircumstantial evidence of his guilt.\n\f                             DOE V. AYERS                                13\n\n    Lastly, Doe asserts that J.B. should have introduced\nevidence that K.H. was dealing drugs out of his home, that he\nhad argued with L.R. shortly before her death and had\npreviously assaulted someone, that neighbors reported\ndomestic problems, and that L.R. had expressed to M.H. her\nfear that her wild life would end before her next birthday. The\nstate is correct that evidence suggesting K.H.’s culpability\nwould have been excluded under People v. Hall, 41 Cal. 3d\n826, 833 (1986), because for third party evidence to come in,\nit must demonstrate more than “mere motive or opportunity.”\nAs for the evidence going more generally to the dangerous\ncircumstances in which the victim lived, we do not believe it\nwould have created significant doubt in the minds of the\njurors.\n\n    J.B. certainly did not provide high-quality representation\nto Doe at the guilt phase of his trial. However, he had a\nstrategic justification for not calling the child witnesses.\nWhile he offered no such justification for his failure to follow\nup with the alibi witness, call the blood spatter expert, or\ndemonstrate the dangerous environment in which the victim\nlived, it appears that none of this evidence would have been\nparticularly persuasive. Failing to impeach P.F., the\nprosecution’s most important witness, would have been a\nvery serious error, but J.B. did offer substantial impeachment\nevidence. Hence, we conclude that Doe has not shown\nprejudice.\n\n    Decisively, the prosecution’s strongest evidence – which\nis not addressed by any of the claims Doe raises here9 – was\n\n\n 9\n   Doe also claims that J.B. was ineffective for his failure to help the jury\ncorrectly interpret his statements on this recording. However, J.B. did in\nfact suggest to the jury that Doe might have made such statements in an\n\f14                          DOE V. AYERS\n\nthe taped conversation between him and his girlfriend, P.F.,\nduring which, as the state argues, Doe made inculpatory\nstatements. While Doe at one point denied involvement and\nnever explicitly confessed, he made a number of very\ndamning statements in regard to the murder. He warned:\n“They can’t prove a motherfuckin’ thing, not unless you open\nyour motherfuckin’ mouth.” He added: “Baby what you fail\nto realize, how the motherfuckers they gonna prove I was\nthere? . . . There ain’t no motherfuckin’ fingerprints, ain’t no\nfuckin’ where in there, and ain’t no fuckin’ body seen me go\nin there and leave out of there.” In response to a request to\ntell her “what the fuck happened over there,” he said: “Why\nshould I, so you can go back and tell [the police?]” When she\nstated that she had seen blood on him that night, he replied,\n“Ain’t on me no more.” Because of the strength of this\nevidence, we conclude that even if J.B. had performed\nadequately, there is not a reasonable probability that the jury\nwould have acquitted Doe of murder.\n\n                              C. Batson\n\n    Third, Doe claims that the prosecutor at his trial used\nperemptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner, and\nthat J.B. was ineffective for his failure to raise an objection.\nFour black veniremembers remained after excuses for\nhardship and death qualification; two were struck by the\nprosecutor, a third was removed for cause, and the remaining\none was empaneled. Doe contends that J.B. was ineffective\nfor failing to challenge these strikes under Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). In fact, J.B. did raise such a\n\n\neffort to end the conversation. While the other “interpretive lens[es]” Doe\nproposes could possibly have been helpful at trial, J.B.’s performance in\nthis respect was not unreasonable.\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              15\n\nchallenge, demanding reasons before the black jurors were\nstruck, but the trial court ruled – correctly – that it was\npremature. For reasons passing understanding, J.B. never\nrenewed his request after the black jurors were removed from\nthe venire. This failure made it necessary for Doe to raise the\nissue of discriminatory jury selection through an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim.\n\n    Doe is correct that this failure constituted deficient\nperformance. Additionally, though, Doe has the burden to\ndemonstrate prejudice by showing that there is a reasonable\nprobability that the claim J.B. failed to raise at trial would\nhave prevailed, either at trial or on appeal. Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 694. He cannot do so.\n\n    In order to prevail on a Batson claim, Doe would have\nneeded to make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor\nexercised his peremptory strikes on the basis of race. To show\nthat he could have done so, he relies on the statistically\ndisparate use of strikes, and on the fact that the prosecutor\nasked black – but not white – veniremembers whether their\nrace might influence their judgment. While the prosecutor’s\ndisparate use of strikes and selective questioning is troubling,\nin a recent and similar case, Carrera v. Ayers, 699 F.3d 1104,\n1110–11 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct.\n2039 (2013), we concluded that under the standard that would\nhave applied at Doe’s trial and on direct appeal,10 such a\n\n 10\n    Id. at 1110. (“We must evaluate Carrera’s ineffective assistance claim\nunder the law the California Supreme Court would have applied on direct\nappeal in 1990. When Carrera’s appeal was decided, the United States\nSupreme Court’s decision in Johnson [v. California, 545 U.S. 162 (2005)\n(holding that the People v. Wheeler, 583 P.2d 748 (Cal. 1978) and Batson\nstandards are different, and that the less demanding Batson standard\ncontrols)] was still fifteen years in the future. We therefore apply\n\f16                          DOE V. AYERS\n\nstatistical disparity combined with questions about racial bias\nposed only to veniremembers of a particular racial or ethnic\ngroup was insufficient to show a “strong likelihood” that the\nstrikes were made “because of [the veniremembers’] group\nassociation,” and therefore insufficient to demonstrate\nprejudice.11 We are bound by that precedent, so we deny\nrelief with respect to the claim that J.B. was ineffective for\nfailing to properly make a Batson challenge.\n\n                               D. Brady\n\n    Fourth, Doe argues that the prosecutor improperly\nwithheld impeachment evidence – namely, that the police\nworking on his case had interceded on behalf of M.H. in a\nwelfare fraud and perjury case. The extent of the intercession,\nif any, remains unclear; there is no evidence in the record of\nany deal, except for a notation in M.H.’s file by an\nunidentified person that she was “very important to [a] case.”\nWhether or not this constituted a violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963),12 however, Doe cannot\n\n\nWheeler’s ‘strong likelihood’ standard, rather than Batson’s ‘raise an\ninference’ standard, in determining whether Carrera would have been able\nto establish a prima facie case . . . .”).\n 11\n      We stated in Carrera, 699 F.3d at 1111:\n\n          It is true that the prosecutor asked Hispanic-surnamed\n          venirepersons whether the fact that the defendant was\n          “of Spanish descent” would affect their deliberations,\n          and that he did not ask potential white jurors similar\n          ethnicity-based questions. However, asking questions\n          about potential bias is the purpose of voir dire.\n 12\n    Certainly, failure to disclose an agreement to put in a good word for\nM.H. might have violated Brady. Hovey, 458 F.3d at 916–17.\n\f                         DOE V. AYERS                           17\n\nestablish prejudice. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263,\n281–82 (1999). M.H.’s testimony simply described items\ntaken from the house during the murder-burglary, which the\nprosecution compared to the (nearly identical) list of items\nP.F. reported seeing in Doe’s possession. Especially given\nthat the jury already knew that M.H. had been charged with\nperjury, it is unlikely to have further discounted her testimony\nupon learning that she received some indefinite benefit for\nher cooperation. What’s more, Doe’s recorded statements,\ndiscussed previously, were strong enough evidence to support\na conviction even if the jury had some doubt about M.H.’s\ncredibility.\n\n                E. Evidence of Prior Crimes\n\n    Fifth, Doe asserts that the jury received extraneous\nevidence of prior crimes he committed, and that this\nprejudiced him. Specifically, he complains that during an\nhour-long mid-trial examination of exhibits, but not during its\neventual deliberations, the jury had access to unredacted\ntranscripts of Doe’s recorded conversation with P.F.\ncontaining references to a prior burglary and a prior assault.\nHowever, these references were extremely brief and buried in\na transcript containing much more compelling evidence of\nDoe’s guilt. Furthermore, the jurors were questioned about\ntheir review of the transcripts after the conclusion of the\npenalty phase, and none remembered reading anything about\nassaults or burglaries in the transcript. We agree with the\ndistrict court that this evidence, even if the jury did see it, was\nharmless.\n\n    Doe also challenges the trial judge’s decision to allow the\nprosecutor to impeach a character witness, D.P., Doe’s\ngirlfriend in California, by asking her whether she had heard\n\f18                      DOE V. AYERS\n\nthat he had been accused of rape in his home state and\nwhether this affected her opinion of him. (It did not.)\nImpeachment of character witnesses with questions about\nprior bad acts of the defendant, even if unproven, is common\npractice. See Fed. R. Evid. 405(a). Thus, this claim fails.\n\n                 F. Cumulative Prejudice\n\n    Sixth, and finally, Doe claims that these guilt-phase errors\nwere cumulatively prejudicial. Because Doe’s guilt-phase\nclaims do not call into question the veracity or admissibility\nof the most damning evidence of his guilt – his own recorded,\ninculpatory statements – we hold that, on the record before\nus, he cannot demonstrate prejudice with respect to his\nconviction.\n\n  IV. Penalty-Phase Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n     More important, for purposes of this opinion, Doe\ncontends that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for\nfailing to investigate, and present at the penalty phase of his\ntrial, certain mitigating evidence. That evidence relates to\nsexual abuse he suffered while previously incarcerated in a\nnotorious prison in the South, as well as to mental illness,\nneglect and abuse he suffered during his childhood, and\nsubstance abuse. To prevail on this claim, Doe must show\nboth that counsel was deficient and that he was prejudiced as\na result. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687–88.\n\n    Deficient performance requires a showing that “counsel’s\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness.” Id. at 688. Defense counsel is “strongly\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all\nsignificant decisions in the exercise of reasonable\n\f                        DOE V. AYERS                         19\n\nprofessional judgment.” Id. at 690. To rebut this presumption,\nDoe must show that J.B. did not act “reasonabl[y] considering\nall the circumstances.” Id. at 688.\n\n      “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s conduct\ncan satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances\nfaced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions\nregarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.” Id. at\n688–89. However, “[r]estatements of professional standards\n. . . can be useful as ‘guides’ to what reasonableness entails\n. . . to the extent they describe the professional norms\nprevailing when the representation took place.” Bobby v. Van\nHook, 558 U.S. 4, 7 (2009). At the time of Doe’s trial in\n1987, the prevailing professional norms, as outlined by the\nABA Standards, required that a lawyer “conduct a prompt\ninvestigation of the circumstances of the case and [] explore\nall avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case\nand the penalty in the event of conviction,” and “called for\n[trial] counsel to cover several broad categories of mitigating\nevidence.” Id. at 7, 11 (citation omitted). The commentary to\nthe standards made clear that “information concerning the\ndefendant’s background, education, employment record,\nmental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the\nlike, will be relevant . . . .” Id. at 7–8.\n\n    “[D]eath is different[.]” Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584,\n587 (2002). So too are the lengths to which defense counsel\nmust go in investigating a capital case. “The imperative to\ncast a wide net for all relevant mitigating evidence is\nheightened at a capital sentencing hearing because the\nConstitution prohibits imposition of the death penalty without\nadequate consideration of factors which might evoke mercy.”\nFrierson, 463 F.3d at 989 (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “Although counsel’s duty to seek out\n\f20                      DOE V. AYERS\n\nevidence of mitigation is not limitless, the Supreme Court has\nrecognized that the failure to pursue avenues of readily\navailable information – such as school records, juvenile court\nand probation reports, and hospital records – may constitute\ndeficient performance.” Id. (citing Rompilla v. Beard,\n545 U.S. 374, 381–83 (2005)).\n\n    Although defense counsel may choose to ignore\nmanifestly unfruitful lines of inquiry, a lawyer has not\nfulfilled his duties to his client if he ceases investigating\nbecause his client has not been forthcoming about his\nbackground or because counsel has acquired some relevant\ninformation. Rather, if what counsel knows or should know\nsuggests that further investigation might yield more\nmitigating evidence, counsel must conduct that investigation.\nSee Douglas v. Woodford, 316 F.3d 1079, 1088–89 (9th Cir.\n2003). “The presence of certain elements in a capital\ndefendant’s background, such as a family history of\nalcoholism, abuse, and emotional problems, triggers a duty to\nconduct further inquiry before choosing to cease\ninvestigating.” Earp v. Ornoski, 431 F.3d 1158, 1175–76 (9th\nCir. 2005).\n\n                 A. Deficient Performance\n\n    We agree with the district court that counsel was\nineffective in failing to investigate and present mitigating\nevidence.\n\n                1. Review of Investigation\n\n    As a preliminary matter, J.B. was deficient in his\nacknowledged failure to consider even the evidence D.S.’s\nlimited investigation had turned up: he did not “listen[] to any\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              21\n\ntapes of [D.S.]’s interviews, nor did [he] read transcripts of\nany taped interviews.” J.B. did read a few summary\ninvestigation reports produced by D.S., but these included\nvirtually no material from the interviews conducted in Doe’s\nhome state. Even if D.S. had conducted an adequate\ninvestigation – which he did not – J.B. would not have\nlearned what D.S. had discovered.\n\n    Because J.B. failed to review and follow up on the\ninformation presented to him by his investigator, he missed\nclear indications, for example, that his client was repeatedly\nraped in prison. An ex-girlfriend, I.R., told D.S. that Doe was\n“fresh meat” upon his arrival in prison at the age of 17, and\nthat people in the community were well aware that fellow\nprisoners “got some” from him.13 J.B. also knew that Doe’s\nmother, C.G., had sought psychiatric help for her son after his\nrelease from prison. J.B.’s file contained a copy of a lengthy\narticle from the inmate newspaper at the notorious Southern\nprison where Doe was incarcerated, which described in\ngraphic detail the frequency and effects of prolonged sexual\nabuse.\n\n                         2. Prison Records\n\n    J.B. had a bit of Doe’s prison file – nine pages of criminal\nrecord, discharge papers, a rap sheet, and fingerprints. D.S.\n\n  13\n       The state suggests an inconsistency between the claim that many\npeople knew about Doe’s victimization, and the fact that most of those\ninterviewed by D.S. did not talk about it. (One other interview subject\nassumed that he was sexually abused and mentioned rumors to that effect.)\nIt is not very difficult to imagine, however, that members of a poor black\ncommunity in the South might not volunteer, unless asked directly,\nembarrassing information about a family member and friend to an\ninterloper from California.\n\f22                          DOE V. AYERS\n\ntold J.B. that to get the complete file, which would shed\nadditional light on Doe’s time in prison, J.B., as counsel,\nwould need to request it. J.B., however, did not follow up on\nthis most straightforward of leads, handed to him by his\ninvestigator: he did not request the records, and “do[es] not\nremember making any efforts to learn about [Doe]’s\nexperience [in prison].”\n\n    In addition, neither J.B. nor D.S. asked Doe whether he\nsuffered abuse while incarcerated. Although Doe told them\nabout being in prison, J.B. was “unaware of any allegation\nthat [Doe] had been [redacted in original] abused [in\nprison],”14 and “did not specifically inquire” about any\nabuse.“I believe I should have known it,” J.B. said.\n\n    J.B.’s failure to send off for Doe’s prison records – easy\nto obtain and very valuable – constituted deficient\nperformance. See Correll v. Ryan, 539 F.3d 938, 945 (9th Cir.\n2008) (finding deficient performance based in part on defense\ncounsel’s failure to obtain correctional records he knew\nexisted).\n\n                      3. Interviews with Doe\n\n    J.B. had only one interview with Doe himself, during\nwhich he barely asked any questions about his upbringing.\nJ.B. admitted that his interview with Doe was perfunctory: “I\n\n\n  14\n    D.S., on the other hand, admits that he “learned that [Doe] had been\nsubjected to some sort of physical and sexual abuse while he was\nincarcerated . . . .” Somehow, this vital piece of information was never\npassed along to J.B. nor pursued further by D.S.; “no further investigation\nwas made into issues relating to [Doe]’s incarceration . . . , including any\nissue relating to sexual victimization.”\n\f                         DOE V. AYERS                          23\n\ndo not recall whether I discussed with [Doe] the abuse from\nhis Uncle [J.C.], but if I did, it was on a superficial level.” He\nalso acknowledged that this failure affected his penalty-phase\npresentation, because “the testimony elicited at trial reflected\nthe extent of the abuse of which I was aware.”\n\n    D.S. also spent a few sessions interviewing Doe. While\nDoe did speak positively about some aspects of his childhood,\nand said that “he would call everyone [in his family] basically\nsane,” Doe did mention – without disclosing its full extent –\nthe physical abuse he suffered at the hands of his uncle. D.S.\nhimself expressed the suspicion that Doe “avoid[ed]” or\n“ignor[ed]” his problems. He expressly informed J.B. that his\ninterview of Doe was merely a preliminary inquiry into Doe’s\npersonal and family history, noting that this “information was\nprovided by [Doe] himself and is [in] no way meant to be a\ncomplete list of information available . . . .”\n\n    As a psychologist later retained by habeas counsel\nexplained, based on professional experience, there are often\nreasons why a person who has been chronically abused and\nneglected might well decline to disclose the details of\ndifficult and embarrassing personal history. That Doe did not\nvolunteer more about the trauma he experienced during his\nchildhood and in prison did not absolve J.B. of the need to\nconduct an adequate mitigation investigation, especially since\nDoe did identify (and D.S. recognized), if not in elaborate\ndetail, a number of avenues for further investigation that\nwould have proved fruitful.\n\n    The district court was correct in concluding that the\ndeficiencies it found in J.B.’s penalty-phase performance\nwere not excused by the alleged failure of Doe (and his\nfamily) to be completely forthcoming. “[Doe] never put any\n\f24                          DOE V. AYERS\n\nlimits on [the] penalty phase investigation,” J.B.\nacknowledged. Nor did he make false statements to J.B. or\nD.S. or obstruct their investigation. Doe simply did what most\ncapital defendants – and most people – do, and did not\nvolunteer deeply painful, shameful information when not\npressed for details. Trial counsel has an affirmative duty not\nto simply accept the facts as they might be presented at first\nblush, but rather to “unearth[] for consideration” at the\nsentencing phase “all relevant mitigation information.”\nWallace v. Stewart, 184 F.3d 1112, 1117 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(quoting Caro v. Calderon, 165 F.3d 1223, 1227 (9th Cir.\n1999)); see also Daniels, 428 F.3d at 1209 (holding that\ncounsel’s failure to investigate was not excused even by his\nclient’s refusal to communicate).\n\n    Anderson v. Calderon, 232 F.3d 1053, 1094 (9th Cir.\n2000), cited by the state, is not to the contrary. There, the\ndefendant “did not disclose information relating to” the issues\nthat later became central to habeas counsel’s mitigation\npresentation: evidence of the physical and emotional abuse\nthe defendant suffered during childhood. Id. Thus, counsel\nhad no clue as to the existence of these occurrences. In\ncontrast, Doe and his family members and friends did\ndisclose some evidence relating to childhood abuse and\nneglect, mental health problems, substance abuse, and even\nvictimization in prison – all of the issues later drawn out by\nhabeas counsel. Although no one delivered to J.B. a fully\ndeveloped mitigation presentation, that does not excuse his\nfailure to pursue the leads he did receive.15 Nor does Babbitt\n\n\n  15\n     Additionally, the Anderson court merged the deficient performance\nand prejudice analyses, denying the failure to investigate claim largely on\nthe basis that presentation of the undiscovered mitigating evidence would\nhave undercut a very intentional (and to the court, persuasive) defense\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                                25\n\nv. Calderon, 151 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir. 1998), help the\nstate. There, we noted that “[o]ther courts have held that\n‘counsel is not deficient for failing to find mitigating\nevidence if, after a reasonable investigation, nothing has put\nthe counsel on notice of the existence of that evidence.’” Id.\n(quoting Matthews v. Evatt, 105 F.3d 907, 920 (4th Cir.\n1997)).\n\n    By contrast, J.B. failed to conduct a reasonable\ninvestigation despite being on notice.\n\n         [A]lthough counsel is not required “to\n         investigate every conceivable line of\n         mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely\n         the effort would be to assist the defendant at\n         sentencing[,]” they are in no position to\n         decide, as a tactical matter, not to present\n         mitigating evidence or not to investigate\n         further just because they have some\n         information about their client’s background.\n         Moreover, . . . the presence of certain\n         elements in a capital defendant’s background,\n         such as a family history of alcoholism, abuse,\n         and emotional problems, triggers a duty to\n         conduct further inquiry before choosing to\n         cease investigating.\n\n\n\n\nstrategy, which included the argument that his “venerable mother [was]\nwronged and imprisoned because of a crooked judge . . . [and that] this\nterribly unjust episode explains and mitigated [his] crooked youthful turn\nin the road.” Id. It is far from clear that even Anderson’s apparent failure\nto reveal any useful information to his defense team would, on its own,\nhave supported the court’s conclusion.\n\f26                           DOE V. AYERS\n\nEarp, 431 F.3d at 1175 (citing Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.\n510, 525, 527, 533 (2003)).\n\n                    4. Interviews with Others\n\n   The interviews conducted by D.S. (and the few\nconversations J.B. himself had) with relatives and friends of\nDoe’s were unquestionably deficient.\n\n   J.B. spoke at any length with only two people: Doe’s\nmother and his aunt, L.P. Had J.B. asked them more than\nadmittedly cursory questions, he would have learned what the\nexperts retained by habeas counsel did.16 Had he gone further\n\n\n     16\n         By and large, the evidence later discovered through more\ncomprehensive interviews was consistent with – and far more detailed\nthan – the history provided initially. The one discrepancy relates to the\nyears during which Doe was under the care of his mother, versus that of\nhis grandmother and uncle. Doe’s mother suggested that he was in her\ncustody for more of his early childhood than was actually the case, though\nD.S. was also told that Doe had been removed from his mother’s care and\nraised by his grandmother and uncle. This disparity should have prompted\nfurther inquiry, but D.S. never asked Doe’s mother for clarification. “[If\nhe had done so,] counsel would have become skeptical of the impression\ngiven by [some of Doe’s] family members and would unquestionably have\ngone further to build a mitigation case. Further effort would presumably\nhave unearthed much of the material postconviction counsel found [with\nrespect to childhood abuse and neglect].” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 391.\nWhen she was asked the question directly, during post-conviction\nproceedings, Doe’s mother testified that her children lived primarily with\ntheir grandmother. Doe’s grandmother and aunt confirmed that his mother\nabandoned Doe at a young age.\n\n     It is not surprising that experts with mitigation training, charged with\nconducting a mitigation investigation, were better able to elicit useful\ninformation about deeply personal, shameful trauma and dysfunction than\nwere a lawyer and investigator who did not follow up on obvious, critical\n\f                          DOE V. AYERS                              27\n\nthan speaking “with them generally about the penalty phase,”\nhe would have discovered powerful mitigating evidence.\nInstead, J.B. abandoned further investigation after “having\nacquired only rudimentary knowledge of [Doe’s] history from\na narrow set of sources[,]” and despite what he “actually\ndiscovered” in the course of his limited investigation.\nWiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524–25 (2003); see also\nBoyde v. Brown, 404 F.3d 1159, 1177 (9th Cir. 2005);\nDouglas, 316 F.3d at 1082, 1088.\n\n    J.B. did travel to Doe’s home state, but when asked if he\nvisited Doe’s house, J.B. said: “I remember going to the\nneighborhood and going to the bar but not – I drove by the\n[family-owned] bar. . . . But I wasn’t comfortable being me\njust getting out and walking in there by myself so I decided\nnot to go in.” He spoke on the phone with Doe’s mother (and\npossibly others) while he was there, but did not conduct any\nin-person interviews. At no point during his representation of\nDoe, J.B. reported, did he speak with anyone other than those\nhe called to testify at the penalty phase.\n\n    When D.S. went to Doe’s home state, he, at least, got out\nof his car. However, he repeatedly failed to ask obvious\nquestions, including follow-up questions when interviewees\nrevealed potentially significant information. He did not ask\nrelatives and friends who had known Doe during his\nchildhood about his upbringing or behavioral signs of mental\nillness. When the mother of one of Doe’s girlfriends (both\nmother and daughter were named V.M.) said she felt he was\n“like a second son,” and that he called to speak with her after\n\n\nleads, and a psychological expert asked only to investigate guilt-phase\nmental-state defenses who was deprived of the background material she\nrequired (and requested) to do even that job adequately.\n\f28                      DOE V. AYERS\n\nhe was released from prison about putting his sentence behind\nhim, D.S. did not follow up to ask whether Doe had ever\nmentioned that he suffered abuse while incarcerated. When\nanother interviewee, M.W., who had known Doe as he was\ngrowing up, described him as a “loner,” D.S. did not ask any\nfollow-up questions about his mental health. Although Doe’s\nstepfather, B.G., had also served time in the same prison, D.S.\ndid not ask him about abuse Doe might have suffered in\nprison. When a friend, J.A., reported that Doe told him over\nthe phone that the prison was a “bad place,” D.S. did not ask\nwhether Doe had said anything further. Other interviewees\nalso mentioned that Doe was different after his release, or that\nthey had spoken to him while he was incarcerated, but D.S.\nnever asked them if they knew about any trauma Doe might\nhave suffered in prison. As J.B. acknowledged, the important\nquestions about Doe’s life were simply never asked.\n\n    D.S. appears to have met only once with each\ninterviewee, and many of the meetings were arranged by\nDoe’s mother at her home. Obviously, interviewees are less\nlikely to be forthcoming about sensitive topics in the presence\nof family members and friends. See Correll v. Ryan, 539 F.3d\n938, 945 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting that “counsel testified that he\nmet only once with Correll’s father, sister, and brother,\n‘around the kitchen table at the same time,’” in concluding\nthat the interviews he conducted were “worthless”).\n\n    In the taped interviews, D.S. did not ask whether\ninterviewees knew of any others who might have more or\nbetter information about Doe’s family history. Although D.S.\nsaid that he would normally conduct interviews in a way that\nwould lead to identification of potential witnesses, he testified\nonly that it was “possible” this was done in this case. Other\nwitnesses, such as those whom habeas counsel was able to\n\f                              DOE V. AYERS                                   29\n\nfind, were “easily within [counsel’s] reach,” and would have\nbeen discovered by trial counsel, “[h]ad [he] only looked.”\nWallace, 184 F.3d at 1116. Some of these witnesses were\nable to speak to Doe’s experiences in prison and their\npsychological effects on him.\n\n                      5. Psychological Experts\n\n     J.B. did retain a psychologist, Dr. M.R., to interview Doe.\nShe had the professional expertise necessary to discover and\npresent the compelling mitigating testimony regarding Doe’s\nmental health that went unheard at trial, but she was limited\nby the terms of her engagement. J.B. hired her, she reported,\nonly to determine whether any mental state defenses based on\n“obvious signs of mental impairment” could be mounted at\nthe guilt phase of the trial. Dr. M.R. reported that she “was\nnot asked to do more,” and that she “was not asked to provide\nexpert assistance in preparing or presenting a mitigation case\nat the penalty trial.”17\n\n     In addition to having a limited scope, the investigation\nthat Dr. M.R. conducted was abbreviated. She was paid only\nfor twelve and a half hours of her time and met with Doe only\nonce, for an hour-long session largely devoted to filling out\na questionnaire and discussing his criminal record. In her\n\n\n  17\n     The state contends that Dr. M.R. was in fact retained for the purpose\nof developing a mitigation case at the penalty phase. When asked whether\nhe actually told her to conduct a penalty-phase investigation, J.B. testified:\n“I don’t recall exactly what I told her. But I did tell her that it was a capital\ncase and that I was looking into all issues with regard to [Doe].” J.B. may\nhave told Dr. M.R. that he was looking into “all issues,” but he did not tell\nher to look into “all issues.” No one else was looking into Doe’s mental\nhealth, either; J.B. did not recall having investigated, or having asked D.S.\nto investigate, whether Doe had ever received psychological treatment.\n\f30                            DOE V. AYERS\n\nreport to J.B., Dr. M.R. described her work as a “relatively\nbrief evaluation,” and described her conclusions as “initial\nclinical impressions.” It appears that J.B. never spoke with\nDr. M.R. after he initially hired her. The only background\nmaterials he provided her were police reports.18 When she left\na message saying that she had “no documents on\nbackground,” he did not bother to return her call.19\n\n  18\n     Dr. M.R. noted this deficiency in her report, stating: “If . . . there is\nfurther information that the defense counsel wishes to bring to my\nattention in order to evaluate [Doe] further, I shall be happy to do so.”\nContrary to the state’s contention, Dr. M.R. made clear that the life history\nshe considered was “provided” by Doe himself during their interview, not\nby D.S.\n     19\n        Providing psychological experts with the background material\nnecessary for them to competently and correctly evaluate defendants is\ncritical, and when such information is requested by an expert, as here, the\nfailure to provide it constitutes deficient performance. When no\nbackground information is made available, experts may conclude that\nfurther investigation will not be fruitful, just as Dr. M.R. did here. See\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 392 (“The jury never heard any of this and neither\ndid the mental health experts who examined [the defendant] before trial.\nWhile they found ‘nothing helpful to [his] case,’ their postconviction\ncounterparts, alerted by information from school, medical, and prison\nrecords that trial counsel never saw, found plenty of ‘red flags’ pointing\nup a need to test further.” (citations omitted)); Silva v. Woodford, 279 F.3d\n825, 842–43 (9th Cir. 2002) (“In Bloom v. Calderon, 132 F.3d 1267 (9th\nCir. 1997), a case with several important parallels to this one, we also\nfound that a trial attorney’s failure to obtain and prepare a psychiatric\nwitness was constitutionally deficient. . . . [H]is trial counsel . . . failed to\nprovide him with necessary and available data which would have assisted\nthe expert in his subsequent evaluation and trial testimony-including an\noutline of the theory of defense. As a result, the psychiatrist, who\nconstituted the sole defense expert witness, produced a severely damaging\npsychiatric report which the prosecution used effectively in cross-\nexamination and in closing argument. We found that such performance\nwas constitutionally deficient, in that counsel had failed to furnish the\nexpert with easily available information such as a social history, a prior\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              31\n\n    This left J.B. effectively without the assistance of any\nexpert at all at the penalty phase. J.B.’s failure to retain a\npsychological expert for the penalty phase was objectively\nunreasonable, given that he had sufficient notice of Doe’s\nmental health problems. He knew – or would have known, if\nhe had reviewed the interviews that D.S. conducted – that\nDoe’s mother brought him to a hospital for psychiatric help.\nD.S. stated in his assessment of Doe, which J.B. does appear\nto have read, that “he will not acknowledge that he has a\npsychiatric problem.” Doe’s mental illness was recognized by\nJ.B.’s investigator, who was not a mental health expert.\nHowever, even this recognition was not enough to motivate\nJ.B. to order a mitigation-related psychiatric examination of\nhis client.\n\n    The state’s assertion that Dr. M.R. addressed the issue of\nmitigating evidence in her report is incorrect. To the extent\nshe commented on evidence relevant to the penalty-phase\npresentation, it was entirely in passing. “If in the course of\nperforming [her limited-scope guilt-phase] evaluation [she\nhad seen] issues that [she] thought would be useful for a\npenalty phase presentation, [she] would have flagged the\nissues for [J.B.].” Dr. M.R. was definitely not, however,\n“providing expert assistance in analyzing and developing a\nfull-blown mitigation case.” Indeed, how could she have\nbeen? She “received no life history information regarding\n[Doe] from the defense.” Instead, she simply explained that\n\n\npsychiatric report, and jail medical records. Although we acknowledged\nthat under Hendricks v. Calderon, 70 F.3d 1032 (9th Cir. 1995), ‘counsel\ndoes not have a duty to acquire sufficient background material on which\nan expert can base reliable psychiatric conclusions independent of any\nrequest for information from an expert,’ we concluded that the record did\nnot support the district court’s finding that the expert had not requested\nsuch information.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f32                        DOE V. AYERS\n\n“[she] had not seen any evidence that [she] believed to be\nmitigating during the course of evaluating whether [Doe] had\na guilt phase mental defense.”20\n\n    Hiring an expert to evaluate possible guilt-phase mental-\nstate defenses does not discharge defense counsel’s duty to\nprepare for the penalty phase. Hendricks v. Calderon, 70 F.3d\n1032 (9th Cir. 1995), is directly on point. In Frierson, we\nexplained:\n\n          Because the evidence presented at each phase\n          of a trial serves a markedly different purpose,\n          we analyze the reasonableness of counsel’s\n          efforts to prepare for trial and sentencing\n          differently. As we explained in Wallace v.\n          Stewart: “Hendricks alludes to why the\n          lawyer’s burden might differ at the guilt phase\n          from that at the penalty phase: Mental state is\n          relevant at the guilt phase for issues such as\n          competence to stand trial and legal insanity –\n          technical questions where a defendant must\n          show a specific and very substantial level of\n          mental impairment. Most defendants don’t\n          have problems this severe, and counsel can’t\n          be expected to know that further investigation\n          is necessary to develop these issues. By\n          contrast, all potentially mitigating evidence is\n          relevant at the sentencing phase of a death\n          case, so a troubled childhood and mental\n          problems may help even if they don’t rise to\n          a specific, technically-defined level.”\n\n\n 20\n      Emphasis added.\n\f                      DOE V. AYERS                       33\n\n       Thus in Hendricks, we held that it was\n       reasonable for counsel to rely on his experts’\n       findings that no diminished capacity defense\n       was available at the guilt phase, and to\n       terminate his perfunctory investigation of his\n       client’s known mental impairments.\n\n       Our determination in Hendricks that counsel’s\n       investigatory work was reasonable, however,\n       did not extend into the penalty phase. Because\n       a sentencing jury is given “broad latitude to\n       consider amorphous human factors, in effect,\n       to weigh the worth of one’s life against his\n       culpability,” we have recognized that the\n       presentation of relevant mitigation evidence is\n       of vital importance to the jury’s penalty\n       determination. Accordingly, we concluded\n       that “counsel’s failure to investigate his\n       client’s mental condition as a mitigating\n       factor in a penalty phase hearing, without a\n       supporting strategic reason, constitute[d]\n       deficient performance.” We therefore held\n       that because evidence of Hendrick’s\n       “nightmarish upbringing” and “mental\n       problems” could have altered the jury’s\n       decision to impose a death verdict, counsel\n       was constitutionally ineffective.\n\n463 F.3d at 993 (citations omitted). Compare Summerlin v.\nSchriro, 427 F.3d 623, 631 (9th Cir. 2005) (counsel’s\nperformance was deficient for relying exclusively on\ninformation developed at the defendant’s pre-trial\ncompetency examination), with Stokley v. Ryan, 659 F.3d\n802, 812–15 (9th Cir. 2011) (counsel’s performance was not\n\f34                       DOE V. AYERS\n\ndeficient, in choosing a neurological exam over a\nneuropsychological exam, when either was recommended,\nbecause counsel did pursue mental health evaluations\npertinent to sentencing, as recommended by mental health\nexperts, provided the documents the experts suggested, and\npresented their testimony).\n\n    Based on this evidence, the district court concluded that\ndefense counsel “did not fulfill his responsibility to [Doe] on\nthe issue of investigating and presenting mental health\ntestimony simply by retaining Dr. [M.R.], given the brief time\nshe spent with him.” Especially given that J.B. failed both to\ninstruct Dr. M.R. specifically to investigate penalty-phase\nmitigation and to provide her with any of the documents\nnecessary to complete that task (which she requested), we\nfirmly agree.\n\n                     6. Substance Abuse\n\n    D.S.’s investigation did not reveal the extent of Doe’s\nsubstance abuse, but it did reveal enough to warrant expert\nfollow-up. Doe acknowledged that he drank alcohol\nexcessively, that he became aggressive when he was drunk,\nand that he had used both marijuana and cocaine. Other\ninterviewees noted that he had problems with alcohol and that\nthe robbery he committed was alcohol-related.\n\n    Most important, D.S. concluded that although “[Doe]\nfeels that he has no drinking problem, . . . [i]t appears to this\ninvestigator that alcohol is a direct cause for [Doe]’s violence\nas he described his past life to me.” He went on to say that\n“[Doe] does not necessarily like to admit that he may have\ncertain problems in particular areas . . . [such as] his inability\nto control his drinking and drug abuse . . . .” Despite his\n\f                              DOE V. AYERS                              35\n\ninvestigator’s clearly expressed disbelief in Doe’s\nrepresentations about substance abuse – in a report he does\nappear to have read – J.B. did not follow up, and thus did not\ndiscover the fact that Doe consumed substances in a failed\nattempt to lessen the pain of the trauma he had suffered.\n\n                     7. Penalty-Phase Witnesses\n\n    In addition, Doe claims, J.B. did nothing to prepare his\npenalty-phase witnesses. J.B. does not dispute this: “I did not\nprepare any of the penalty phase witnesses for their\ntestimony. I did not tell them what specific questions I was\ngoing to ask them nor did we discuss the responses I expected\nfrom them.”21 Although this failure, on its own, might have\nbeen insufficient to establish deficient performance, it serves\nhere to reinforce other evidence of J.B.’s woefully\nincompetent mitigation investigation and presentation.22\n\n    The witnesses who did end up testifying were family and\nfriends attending the trial. Some of them were not told that\nthey would be testifying until they arrived.23\n\n\n 21\n      When asked how he chose which witnesses to call, he could not recall.\n 22\n    Notably, these witnesses could have spoken to much of the mitigating\nevidence later presented during Doe’s habeas hearing, except for the\ndetails of his prison experience (but including the psychological\nramifications of it).\n  23\n     J.B. never informed two witnesses that he would be calling them as\nwitnesses. He spoke to Doe’s aunt before she testified, but did not tell her\nwhat he planned to ask her, and merely instructed her to “plead for\n[Doe]’s life.” J.B. spoke with Doe’s ex-girlfriend, D.P., prior to her\ntestimony, but just briefly, “to get to know her,” and not about what he\nwould ask or what she would say.\n\f36                         DOE V. AYERS\n\n    J.B. did little better with the two penalty-phase witnesses\nhe “spent a lot of time with[,]”24 Doe’s mother and aunt. He\nacknowledged in his declaration that his failure to prepare\nthem to testify was related to his failure to discover the\npowerful mitigating evidence about which they could have\nspoken. He said: “[M]y relationship with them was quite\nsuperficial, and I got very little useful or accurate information\nfrom them about [Doe]’s life before his arrest for this\noffense.” J.B. also acknowledged that he “spoke with them\nonly generally about the penalty phase [and] did not go over\nwith them the particular questions they would be asked.” He\nexplained that Doe’s “mother and aunt seemed like such nice,\nsweet ladies that I never got beyond consoling them about\n[Doe]’s plight so as to get to really understand his life.”\n\n    The state’s argument that J.B.’s failure to prepare penalty-\nphase witnesses was an acceptable trial strategy is erroneous.\nEven if it were an intentional decision on his part – which is\nboth doubtful and disturbing – spur-of-the-moment mitigation\npresentations form no part of constitutionally adequate\nrepresentation. Witness preparation is a critical function of\ncounsel. See Hamilton v. Ayers, 583 F.3d 1100, 1121 (9th Cir.\n2009) (“[T]he failure to prepare a witness adequately can\nrender a penalty phase presentation deficient. This is\nespecially true when the insufficiently prepared witness[es]\n[are] the only penalty phase witness[es] called to testif[y].”\n(emphasis and citations omitted)); Douglas, 316 F.3d at\n1088–89 (failure to prepare defense mitigation witnesses led\nboth to inadequate development of evidence and also to less-\nthan-compelling testimony). A lawyer needs to know the\n\n\n 24\n    Actually, he met in person with Doe’s mother only two or three times,\neach time for less than an hour. It is not clear how much time they spent\non the phone.\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                               37\n\nnature of the testimony he will elicit, and a witness needs to\nunderstand the proceeding in which he is participating. Our\ncase law, and an elementary understanding of the function of\na trial lawyer in our adversary system, make plain that\nalthough there is no requirement of rehearsal,25 not preparing\npenalty-phase witnesses at all is not a legitimate defense\nmethod in a capital trial.\n\n                            8. Conclusion\n\n    The investigation here was facially inadequate. J.B. fell\nfar short of his “sacrosanct duty to conduct a full and\ncomplete mitigation investigation.” Earp, 431 F.3d at 1175.\nThis conclusion is only strengthened by the fact that the\nlimited investigation J.B. and D.S. did conduct put them on\nnotice that further investigation was warranted. Unfortunately\nfor Doe, they failed to perform it. We have repeatedly held,\nas has the Supreme Court, that this constitutes deficient\nperformance. See Lambright v. Schriro, 490 F.3d 1103, 1117\n(9th Cir. 2007) (reaffirming the principle that “when\n‘tantalizing indications in the record’ suggest that certain\nmitigating evidence may be available, those leads must be\npursued” (emphasis added) (quoting Stankewitz v. Woodford,\n365 F.3d 706, 719–20 (9th Cir. 2004))); see also Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 525 (“The scope of their investigation was also\nunreasonable in light of what counsel actually discovered in\nthe [files he did obtain]. . . . [A]ny reasonably competent\n\n  25\n    J.B. stated that he has a practice of not rehearsing witnesses. That is\nall well and good. However, there is a big difference between training\nwitnesses to regurgitate a prepared statement and discussing with\nwitnesses the process and purpose of the hearing and the scope and\nsubstance of their prospective testimony. The former might indeed\nundermine their credibility on the stand, whereas the latter is\nconstitutionally required.\n\f38                      DOE V. AYERS\n\nattorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was\nnecessary to making an informed choice among possible\ndefenses . . . .

Wong,\n698 F.3d 1163, 1171 (9th Cir. 2012) (“The state’s argument\nthat [defense counsel’s] mere possession of [files containing\nleads to mitigating evidence] demonstrates that [he]\nconducted a reasonable investigation defies logic – if\nanything, that [he] had this evidence at his fingertips but did\nnot investigate or present it is further proof of his\ndeficiency.”).\n\n    J.B. said: “I did not adequately prepare for a penalty\nphase in this case because of a combination of inexperience\nand overconfidence. . . . I did not ask the right questions of\n[Doe], his family, myself, or my investigator to obtain an\nadequate understanding of my client and his case.” We cannot\nhelp but agree.\n\n                   B. Strategic Judgment\n\n     There is a “wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance[,]” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, but J.B.’s\nperformance was not within its outer bounds. Unlike most\ntrial lawyers called to testify before a habeas court, J.B. never\nattempted to justify his actions as based in strategy; he\nadmitted that he would have presented the extensive\nmitigating evidence habeas counsel discovered, had he found\nit himself. J.B. acknowledged that he did not make a strategic\ndecision not to put on the sort of mitigating evidence later\nadduced; he simply didn’t know about it. “Looking back on\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              39\n\nthe penalty phase of [Doe]’s trial, it’s hard for me to say what\nmy strategy was,” he said.26\n\n    Strickland tells us that “strategic choices made after less\nthan complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the\nextent that reasonable professional judgments support the\nlimitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a\nduty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\nreasonable decision that makes particular investigations\nunnecessary.” 466 U.S. at 690–91. In conducting this\nanalysis, we “must indulge a strong presumption that\ncounsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance.”27 Id. at 689.\n\n   Here, J.B.’s “failure to investigate thoroughly resulted\nfrom inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment.” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 526. “[D]efense counsel failed to make a\n\n  26\n    J.B. stated that by putting on a few witnesses who knew, loved, and\nfound value in Doe, thereby humanizing him, he “did not intend to\nexclude or foreclose the presentation of other types of mitigating\nevidence.” Surely a penalty-phase presentation is not insulated from\nreview merely because it is not entirely devoid of value, due to a few\nquestions to a few witnesses that foreseeably elicited snippets of\nmitigation testimony. Notably, the evidence Doe argues that J.B. should\nhave discovered and introduced was in no way inconsistent with the paltry\nevidence already presented.\n   27\n      Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct 1388 (2011), altered rather than\nclarified the analysis we apply in evaluating deficient performance of\ncounsel going forward. This is because AEDPA requires, and Pinholster\napplies, not only Strickland’s presumption of attorney competence but also\nan additional layer of deference. As Chief Judge Kozinski put it,\n“Strickland’s presumption of competence and AEDPA deference each\nrequire us to presume that the lawyers did the smart thing, not the dumb\none.” Pinholster v. Ayers, 590 F.3d 651, 702 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)\n(Kozinski, C.J., dissenting) (emphasis added).\n\f40                         DOE V. AYERS\n\nreasonable investigation into potential mitigating evidence.\nTherefore, his decision not to put on a mitigation case cannot\nbe considered to be the product of a strategic choice. An\nuninformed strategy is not a reasoned strategy. It is, in fact,\nno strategy at all.” Correll, 539 F.3d at 949.\n\n    The presumption that defense counsel’s conduct falls\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance is\ninapposite, or at least firmly rebutted, when, as here, we know\nfor sure that defense counsel had no strategy, because he has\nunequivocally said as much. Representing a capital defendant\nwithout a strategy is per se unreasonable, and necessarily\nconstitutes deficient performance.\n\n      Generally, we credit the statements of defense counsel as\nto whether their decisions at trial were – or were not – based\non strategic judgments.28 In Heishman v. Ayers, 621 F.3d\n1030, 1040 (9th Cir. 2010), we made clear that the trial\nstrategy presumption does not apply when it “would\ncontradict [defense counsel’s] testimony rather than filling a\ngap in memory, contravening the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition against adopting ‘a post hoc rationalization of\ncounsel’s conduct’ instead of relying on an ‘accurate\ndescription of their deliberations’ [when one exists].” Id.\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 526–27). See also Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 373 (2000) (crediting “trial counsel’s\ntestimony before the state habeas court [that] counsel did not\nfail to seek [the defendant’s] juvenile and social services\nrecords because he thought they would be counterproductive\n. . . [and his] acknowledg[ment] in the course of the hearings\n\n\n  28\n    We do not foreclose the possibility that a court could find defense\ncounsel not credible. However, there is no reason to conclude that J.B.\nwas not telling the truth when he acknowledged his deficient performance.\n\f                             DOE V. AYERS                                 41\n\nthat information about [the defendant’s] childhood would\nhave been important in mitigation”).29\n\n    In any event, it is self-evident that J.B.’s failure to\nconduct further mitigation investigation was objectively\nunreasonable. “This is [] a case in which the defendant’s\nattorneys failed to act while potentially powerful30 mitigating\nevidence stared them in the face, or would have been\napparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have\nobtained.” Bobby, 558 U.S. 11 (citing Wiggins, 539 U.S. at\n525; Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 389–93). D.S. suggested that J.B.\nobtain Doe’s prison file, which contained readily apparent\n\n\n   29\n       Justice Scalia, dissenting in Wiggins, made clear that explicit\nstatements by defense counsel should be credited. See 539 U.S. at 557\n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (decrying the fact that the majority “disbelieves the\nsworn testimony of a member of the bar”); see also id. at 538\n(emphasizing that although “trial counsel testified under oath” that he\nconducted an investigation adequate to consider and reject the presentation\nof the mitigating evidence at issue, the majority concluded otherwise). He\ninstructed that in the course of a prejudice analysis, we should credit trial\ncounsel’s statements about whether undiscovered evidence would have\nbeen introduced at trial. See id. at 553–54 (“It is irrelevant whether a\nhypothetical ‘reasonable attorney’ might have introduced evidence of\nalleged sexual abuse; [defense counsel] would not have done so, and\ntherefore [the defendant] was not prejudiced by their allegedly inadequate\ninvestigation.”). If we should trust the sworn statements of lawyers who\nclaim to have performed adequately, we should certainly trust the sworn\nstatements of lawyers who say they did not, against the interests of both\ntheir egos and their bar licenses.\n   30\n      Our conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the unpresented\nmitigating evidence was so strong. Stankewitz, 698 F.3d at 1172–73 (“It\nis simply untenable that [his] decision to forego powerful mitigating\nevidence and instead put on his paltry penalty phase presentation was\nmade in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.” (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f42                     DOE V. AYERS\n\nand powerful mitigating evidence. He failed to do so. D.S.\nnoted that Doe was beaten as a child, and reported to J.B. his\nbelief that Doe suffered more from mental health problems\nand substance abuse than he was willing to admit. Yet, no\nfollow-up investigation to explore these issues was ever done.\nJ.B. did not retain an expert to conduct a penalty-phase\ninvestigation, and when the psychologist he hired to consider\nmental state defenses at the guilt phase, Dr. M.R., called him\nto ask for records that would have allowed her to uncover the\navailable mitigating evidence, he didn’t even bother to return\nher call. This slipshod work cannot be “immunized from\nSixth Amendment challenges simply by attaching to it the\nlabel of ‘trial strategy.’” Silva v. Woodford, 279 F.3d 825,\n846 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   In short, the evidence that J.B.’s performance at the\npenalty phase fell well below the constitutional minimum is\noverwhelming.\n\n                       V. Prejudice\n\n    Although the district court found that J.B. had performed\nincompetently, it concluded that his deficient performance\nhad not prejudiced Doe. That conclusion is erroneous.\n\n    To establish prejudice, Doe must show “a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.” Id. “That requires a ‘substantial,’ not just a\n‘conceivable,’ likelihood of a different result.” Pinholster,\n131 S. Ct. at 1403 (quoting Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct.\n770, 792 (2011)). “[T]he question is whether there is a\n\f                          DOE V. AYERS                             43\n\nreasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer\n. . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695. We therefore “reweigh the evidence in\naggravation against the totality of available mitigating\nevidence.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534.31 Because death\nsentences in California must be imposed by a unanimous jury,\nwe must find prejudice if there is a “reasonable probability\nthat at least one juror would have” voted for life. Id. at 537;\nCal. Penal Code § 190.4(b). We hold that there is a\nsubstantial probability that there would have been a different\nresult at the penalty phase had counsel’s performance during\nthat phase of the trial not been ineffective.\n\n             A. Aggravating Evidence at Trial\n\n    The aggravating evidence the jury considered was, for a\ncapital case, fairly minimal. Instead of any additional\nevidence about the murder for which Doe had just been\nconvicted, beyond what was presented during the guilt phase\nof the trial, a stipulation was read to the jury that said in its\nentirety that a doctor, if called to testify, would state that “the\nvictim in this case [L.R.] at the time of her death had a mild\nhemiparesis of the brain as a result of congenital cerebral\npalsy which entailed a varying but never totally disabling of\nher impairment in motor coordination and muscular\ndevelopment on her left side only.”\n\n   31\n      As above, we conduct this analysis without affording the extra\ndeference to state court decisions required by Pinholster. There, the\nSupreme Court explained that pre-AEDPA case law offered no guidance\nas to post-AEDPA assessments of prejudice, because AEDPA requires\ndoubly deferential review. For the same reason, post-AEDPA cases offer\nus little guidance here. We apply only the deference required by\nStrickland, and no second layer of deference.\n\f44                          DOE V. AYERS\n\n    The remainder of the aggravating evidence consisted\nsolely of testimony about two incidents:\n\n    First, the prosecution called one of two women who were\nwalking together in a park in Doe’s home state when Doe\nrobbed them at gunpoint. The jury learned that Doe, then a\njuvenile, had grabbed the woman’s arm, pointed a gun at her,\nand demanded both of their purses. He fled immediately after\nacquiring them, leaving the women uninjured. A certified\ncopy of Doe’s conviction, showing that he had served five\nyears in prison for this crime, was also introduced.\n\n     Second, the jury heard testimony about another incident,\nin which Doe was arrested on suspicion of residential\nburglary. (No conviction resulted.) Doe – who was homeless\nat the time – broke into an apartment after its residents left for\nwork and got into bed. When he was found there, by a police\nofficer, he was under the covers, wearing a sweatshirt and\nsweatpants but no socks or shoes. He initially gave a false last\nname and said that he had spent the previous night with his\ngirlfriend, who, he said, lived in the apartment. After he was\narrested, Doe was allowed to retrieve some of his clothing,\nwhich he had hung in the closet. At the police station, Doe\nadmitted that he had entered through the window, but said\nthat he had touched nothing and only wanted to sleep. In fact,\nit appeared that he had riffled through the kitchen, and moved\nthe TV and VCR away from the wall (a screwdriver was\nfound nearby). A long knife was found on the floor of the\nbathroom;32 he had neglected to flush the toilet.\n\n\n\n 32\n    The two police officers called to testify also mentioned that when they\narrived at the apartment, they encountered a man – not Doe – holding a\ncrowbar and guarding the door. Apparently (and confusingly), they seem\n\f                           DOE V. AYERS                               45\n\n    This penalty-phase aggravating evidence is a far cry from\nthat which the Supreme Court deemed “extensive” in\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1408. There, the state presented\nevidence that the defendant had “threatened to kill the State’s\nlead witness, assaulted a man with a straight razor, and\nkidnapped another person with a knife.” Id. There was also\nevidence that he “had a history of violent outbursts, including\nstriking and threatening a bailiff after a court proceeding at\nage 17, breaking his wife’s jaw, resisting arrest by faking\nseizures, and assaulting and spitting on police officers.” Id.\nMoreover, the jury in Pinholster heard about the defendant’s\n\n         involvement in juvenile gangs and his\n         substantial disciplinary record in both county\n         and state jails, where he had threatened,\n         assaulted, and thrown urine at guards, []\n         fought with other inmates . . . [and] had been\n         segregated for a time due to his propensity for\n         violence and placed on a ‘special disciplinary\n         diet’ reserved only for the most disruptive\n         inmates.\n\nId. Doe’s criminal record – the only aggravating evidence\npresented by the state at the penalty phase – was light\ncompared to those of many capital defendants; his only\nprevious conviction was for an armed robbery, in which no\none was injured, committed when he was a juvenile.\n\n    When compared with the offenses of other death-eligible\ndefendants, all of which necessarily involve egregious crimes\n\n\n\nto have left to retrieve the key from management without confronting him;\nwhen they returned, this man had disappeared.\n\f46                           DOE V.

Mitigating Evidence at Trial\n\n     J.B.’s penalty-phase evidentiary presentation was brief\n(the testimony of the five witnesses spanned only 35 pages of\ntrial transcript), haphazard, and thoroughly underwhelming.\nOnly two of the five witnesses had even known Doe since\nbefore he had moved to California, a few years prior, and the\nonly one who testified about his life before that point was his\nmother.\n\n    Doe’s mother testified that Doe’s uncle “did most of the\ndiscipline” and would “whip him and as he got older he’d use\nmore physical violence with him,” but “not before [the age\nof] five” – “[at] about the age of maybe 11, 12.” She said that\nDoe’s uncle was “very stern,” and that as “[Doe] grew older\nhe handled him more roughly than he did when he was\nyounger.” She stated that she moved out of the house during\nDoe’s childhood, but moved back in with her mother a few\nyears later. She said that while she was doing domestic work,\nher mother would care for Doe. She explained that when she\nmarried her husband, Doe, then a teenager, had “become\n\n  36\n     The facts of the offense are drawn from Hendricks v.

She stated\nthat a few days before Doe committed the armed robbery,\nwhen she was eight months pregnant, Doe and his uncle got\ninto a fight; his uncle “tried to hit him with a car but [hit her]\ninstead[,]” sending her to the hospital. She testified that Doe\nhad never been in trouble before and behaved and performed\nwell in school, that she visited him often in prison, and that\nher husband had also been incarcerated in the same prison.\nShe said that after Doe’s release, “[h]e was very nervous.”\nShe stated that for years, Doe had no contact with his father\nor paternal grandmother. She concluded her testimony by\ntelling the jury that she loved Doe, and asking it to spare his\nlife.37\n\n   The second witness, D.P., had been a live-in girlfriend of\nDoe’s in California. When they lived together in an apartment\ncomplex she owned, he helped out as a handyman, and was\n“very loving and very affectionate” in taking care of her\nyoung children. Although she broke up with Doe, they had\nremained in touch. She described him as “compassionate,\nwarm and considerate of other people. Sometimes angry,\nsometimes just crushed.” She said that he “showed me\nnothing but love and affection” and that “he was the first and\n\n\n    37\n       Although there were glimmers of mitigation in Doe’s mother’s\ntestimony at the penalty phase, J.B. introduced this evidence “in a cursory\nmanner that was not particularly useful or compelling.” Stankewitz,\n365 F.3d at 724 (quoting Douglas, 316 F.3d at 1090; citing Bean v.\nCalderon, 163 F.3d 1073, 1081 (9th Cir. 1998) (considering that\n“potentially mitigating factors . . . were reported to the jury only in the\nvaguest of terms” in concluding that confidence in the outcome was\nundermined as a result of counsel’s failure to present mitigating\nevidence)).\n\f                        DOE V.

She studied the Bible\nwith him regularly and spoke with him on a daily basis. She\ntestified that Doe had participated in religious classes, taken\ntests, and obtained certificates, and that he had begun to\norganize Bible study classes.\n\n    The fourth witness, Doe’s father, J.A., had only met Doe\na few years earlier. He testified that he had reconnected with\nhis son because when his mother fell ill, she asked to see Doe\nbefore she died. Doe lived with him briefly, but then went to\nlive with J.A.’s niece. J.A. also explained that his new wife\nhad expressed concern that Doe’s presence in their home\nmight lead him to get in contact with Doe’s mother. Doe’s\nfather did not know that Doe had been in prison in his home\nstate.\n\n    The fifth witness, Doe’s aunt, had known him for\ndecades, but was asked – and testified – only about events\nthat occurred after his arrival in California. She stated that he\nhad lived with her, and that she had helped him find\ntemporary work. She testified further that her husband “blew\nup” at him over a disagreement and kicked him out of the\nhouse, but that Doe had remained calm while her husband\nthreatened violence. She acknowledged that she had “pretty\nstrong feelings, love towards [Doe],” and said that she would\n“stand behind him” if he was allowed to live.\n\f50                            DOE V. AYERS\n\n    The mitigating evidence that was introduced at Doe’s trial\nwas quite bland, and apparently proved insufficient to\novercome even the relatively minimal presentation of\naggravating evidence offered by the state. It is not altogether\nsurprising that not a single member of the jury voted for life\nwithout parole instead of death on the basis of J.B.’s inept\npenalty-phase presentation.\n\n    Because the aggravating evidence presented in the penalty\nphase was, for a capital case, relatively minimal, and any\nmeaningful mitigating evidence virtually nonexistent, Doe\nwill have successfully shown prejudice if he has adduced\nstrong mitigating evidence in his habeas proceedings.\n\n       C. Mitigating Evidence Not Introduced at Trial\n\n    The powerful evidence introduced in the habeas\nproceedings at the district court, by contrast, represented the\nfruits of an appropriate mitigation investigation. Doe’s habeas\ncounsel reviewed Doe’s complete prison record and other\nrecords, and conducted in-depth, targeted interviews with\nfamily members and friends, as well as with fellow prisoners\nwho had known Doe during his incarceration. Habeas counsel\nalso retained two psychological experts38 to conduct a\n\n\n  38\n     The first, Dr. J.C., has a Ph.D. in social psychology. Dr. J.C. was\ngiven instructions to undertake the sort of mitigation investigation Dr.\nM.R. was never hired to conduct; she was asked to “evaluate his social\nhistory and background, paying particular attention to his familial,\ncultural, medical, and psychiatric history[,] . . . [and to] discuss the effects\nof that social background on [Doe’s] psychological development, as well\nas on his level of functioning . . . as a teenager while incarcerated . . . .”\nThe second, E.P., a clinical psychologist, had previously been qualified as\nan expert witness on male sexual victimization in prisons. Both reviewed\ndocuments provided by Doe’s habeas counsel and conducted interviews.\n\f                             DOE V. AYERS                                51\n\npenalty-phase mitigation investigation, and equipped them\nwith relevant records and witness declarations. Finally, he\nobtained declarations from experts on corrections in Doe’s\nhome state.\n\n    It is plain that although “[t]his evidence might not have\nmade [him] any more likable to the jury, . . . it might well\nhave helped the jury understand [him], and his horrendous\nacts . . . .” Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, 951 (2010)\n(emphasis added). “Rather than creating the risk of an\nunguided emotional response, full consideration of evidence\nthat mitigates against the death penalty is essential if the jury\nis to give a “reasoned moral response to the defendant’s\nbackground, character, and crime.” Penry v. Lynaugh,\n492 U.S. 302, 328 (1989) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002). The Supreme Court has long\nmade clear that “fundamental respect for humanity . . .\n\n\n     The state incorrectly suggests that the expert testimony of Dr. J.C. and\nE.P. would not have been admissible at trial. Under California’s Evidence\nCode, an expert witness may offer opinions based on “matter (including\nhis special knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education) . . . made\nknown to him at or before the hearing, whether or not admissible, that is\nof a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an\nopinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates . . . .” Cal. Evid.\nCode § 801(b). The sorts of material on which Dr. J.C. and E.P. relied –\nprison records, interviews with Doe, his family members and friends, and\nprisoner affidavits – are those on which any adequate mitigation\ninvestigator not only may but must rely. See Heishman, 621 F.3d at 1041\nn.3 (“[T]rial counsel could have presented expert psychological testimony\nregarding [defendant]’s diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder. If so,\nthe expert would have been able to base her opinions on inadmissible\nhearsay – [his] out-of-court statements regarding sexual abuse – and to\ndiscuss both those opinions and the underlying hearsay in court, just as\n[defendant]’s experts have done in these habeas proceedings.”).\n\f52                           DOE V. AYERS\n\nrequires consideration of the character and record of the\nindividual offender,” because therein may lie “compassionate\nor mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of\nhumankind.” Woodson v. N. Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304\n(1976). Doe should have been presented to and considered by\nthe jury as a “uniquely individual human being[],” who\nendured the trauma we now recount. Id.\n\n                          1. Rape in Prison\n\n    The most compelling mitigating evidence that J.B. failed\nto discover was also the easiest to obtain. There was reliable\nevidence, in documents that J.B.’s investigator specifically\ninstructed him to request and in testimony from a prison\nguard and multiple prisoners,39 that Doe – then a 17-year-old\n\n\n\n 39\n    The state argues that the evidence from which defense counsel could\nhave established that Doe was repeatedly raped in prison would not have\nbeen credible. This is not the case. The fact that Doe was repeatedly and\nviolently assaulted by other prisoners is very well corroborated, through\nthe combination of his prison records, his own statements as reported by\ntwo psychological experts, the declarations of some family members and\nfriends, the declarations of a number of fellow prisoners, and the\nconfirmatory declarations of two prison experts with knowledge of the\nprison. The evidence is detailed and consistent. At the hearing in the\ndistrict court, counsel for the state was apparently so unconcerned with\nrefuting the testimony of those prisoners that he accepted the submission\nof their declarations and waived the right to cross-examine them.\n\n     P.P., a warden at the prison just before Doe’s term of incarceration,\nconcluded based on his review Doe’s prison record that it was “extremely\nlikely that petitioner [Doe] was repeatedly subjected to forced sexual\ncontact by other inmates during his incarceration . . . .”\n\n    Another expert, D.B.F., an associate professor of criminal justice, had\nserved as an expert on jails and prisons in state and federal courts in Doe’s\n\f                            DOE V.

Doe\nhimself, when asked directly about his experience by trained\nmental health professionals equipped with his records and\ncharged with the task of discovering information relevant to\nthe penalty phase, disclosed his abuse in vividly painful\ndetail. However, evidence concerning Doe’s chilling, brutal\nexperience in prison was completely absent from the penalty\nphase of the trial. Had J.B. conducted an adequate\ninvestigation, he would have discovered this information and\ncould have presented it, along with psychological expert\ntestimony explaining its impact, to the jury.\n\n    Dr. J.C. reported, based on her review of Doe’s prison\nrecord and the interviews she conducted with Doe and others,\nthat he experienced “a series of violent physical and sexual\n\n\n\nhome state. D.B.F. described the notorious prison in which Doe was\nincarcerated:\n\n         The strong ruled, and the weak either served or\n         perished. Sexual abuse and homosexual slavery were\n         widespread, with inmates auctioned, sold and traded\n         like cattle by other inmates. . . . Many young inmates –\n         black and white – who came to [the prison] in the 1970s\n         to serve short terms for less serious felonies ended up\n         with much longer sentences, including natural life\n         terms, for trying to escape or fighting back, sometimes\n         to the death, against rape and exploitation.\n\nThe rampant sexual violence in this prison was also acknowledged by\nanother former warden in his memoir. (Citation omitted.)\n\n     Even if jurors were inclined to doubt the truthfulness of prisoners’\ntestimony, they would presumably credit that of a warden and a professor.\n\f54                          DOE V. AYERS\n\nassaults directed at him by other prisoners.”40 He was only 17\nyears old when his incarceration – and brutalization –\nbegan.41 She noted that his records from the penitentiary\nhospital include entries showing that he suffered lacerations,\nbruises, and fractures consistent with these assaults. E.P.\nfound, during his review of Doe’s prison records, “a report by\na guard stating that he saw [Doe] lying on the seat of a\ngarbage truck face down with his jump suit pulled down\nbelow his knees and inmate [R.S.] lying on [Doe] with his\npenis in [Doe]’s rectum.”42\n\n\n\n  40\n     It is unclear how many times Doe was raped. E.P. noted that Doe told\nhim he had been raped three times, but that other sources reported many\nmore. “It is common for male victims of prison rape to under-report the\nnumber of times they have been raped,” he explained, “because of the\nshame and trauma associated with prison rape.” E.P. believed that Doe\nhad been raped more than three times.\n\n     Additionally, Dr. J.C. received a report from a close friend of Doe’s\nthat he was raped in the jail where he was held prior to being transferred\nto prison. Doe also revealed that he suffered violence at the hands of\nguards, including gassing and starvation, which he described as a\n“nightmare.” His aunt also reported hearing from a cousin of Doe’s, N.M.,\nthat guards had beaten and kicked Doe until his clothes came off and he\nurinated and defecated on himself. However, because these incidents are\nnot corroborated elsewhere in the record, we have not weighed them in\nmitigation.\n  41\n     Youth is one of the primary risk factors for sexual victimization in\nprison.

[R.S.] was a much bigger man than [Doe].\n\n     The fact that guards did not observe – or at least did not report – the\nother occasions when Doe was raped is hardly surprising, given that the\ndorms in this prison were not staffed at night. One prisoner, D.S.,\nexplained that “the dorms were wild and out of control at night. Young\ninmates were regularly raped, inmates were routinely killed. No one was\nsafe. . . . The guards just didn’t care what went on out of their sight.”\nAnother prisoner, A.S., said that “the mentality of the guards was to let it\nall happen and ignore the inmates getting hurt as a means of keeping\ncontrol.”\n\n    In the same year this case began, another circuit denounced “the\ninability or unwillingness of some prison administrators to take the\nnecessary steps to protect their prisoners from sexual and physical assaults\nby other inmates” as “a national disgrace.” Martin v.

Another inmate\n         [J.E.] physically assaulted [Doe] and told him\n         he would be his “gal boy” or he would die.\n\nDoe reported that he “remembers lying on the floor after one\nof these physical assaults wondering[,] ‘[H]ow am I gonna\nsurvive?

Dr. J.C. stated:\n\n         [Doe]’s traumatic experiences [in prison] may have\n         been even more painful to him due to the knowledge\n         that at least some of the assaults may have been\n         arranged by his mother’s husband. Family members\n         report that [B.G.], [Doe]’s mother’s husband at the time\n         [Doe] entered [prison], had it in for [Doe] and set it up\n         so that [Doe] would be raped.\n\nDoe’s aunt heard from her nephew, N.M., that this was true. Two\nprisoners independently stated as much. One said:\n\n         [R.R.] saw to it that [Doe] was taken to the gym and set\n         up. At the gym, [Doe] was forced to go into a room\n         with various guys who forced him to have sex with\n         them. . . . After that [Doe] tried to keep on running. The\n         problem was that [R.R.] had too many friends in the\n         main prison. Even though [Doe] kept moving from\n         camp to camp, he was never safe.\n  45\n    In fact, Doe did hurt himself. Dr. J.C. discovered, upon review of\nDoe’s prison records, that they “document [Doe]’s attempts to harm\nhimself by mutilating his right forearm and wrists.” She noted that in her\nexpert opinion, “[t]his suicidal gesture is not surprising given that [Doe]’s\nlong-standing depression had been complicated by feelings of betrayal,\nshame, and rage, along with ongoing anxiety regarding continued future\nassaults.”\n\f58                           DOE V. AYERS\n\n    On another occasion, Doe told E.P., he was “raped in a\nfull dormitory, in front of all the other inmates there at the\ntime.”46 A different time, Doe\n\n         was walking on the grounds when he was\n         grabbed and pulled to the ground with a knife\n         to the throat [and raped]. [Doe] says about this\n         experience, “I had come too far to die up in\n         this place here,” which of course was his\n         primary concern. . . . When he was released\n         [Doe] was “just glad to get out of there\n         walking.”\n\n    Powerful prisoners apparently controlled Doe no matter\nwhere he moved in prison. E.B., a prisoner who knew Doe,\nsaid:\n\n         The older inmates got [Doe] when he first\n         came to [prison]. . . . An older inmate put a\n         claim on [Doe]as his own. [Doe] was moved\n         to . . . a camp here, . . . for protection. . . .\n         [Doe] could have tried to get away from [B.]\n         and from being forced to have sex with other\n         inmates by moving from one camp to another,\n         but [Doe] never would have been able to\n         really get away. Once [Doe] was owned by\n\n\n  46\n      Doe told E.P. that he had “blocked . . . out” the memory of this\nparticular rape until he was released. E.P. explained that this “dissociative\nevent,” a “symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,” “indicates the\nrelative severity of this particular rape, which was much more public and\ntherefore more shameful than the prior rape. The public nature of it would\nalso represent greater danger since that kind of branding in the prison\nculture can lead to many more rape attempts.”\n\f                           DOE V.

And that inmate\n         wouldn’t just be forced to have sex with the\n         one inmate, he would be forced into\n         prostitution for the benefit of the inmate who\n         owned him – often for just a carton of\n         cigarettes. . . . The inmate who owned him\n         would send word to the new cell or dorm that\n         [Doe] belonged to him. Someone in the new\n         setting would be charged with taking care of\n         [Doe] for the first inmate, and it would all\n         start again. [Doe] would have had no way to\n         escape the life he was forced into. He would\n         have been utterly trapped.47\n\n    Dr. J.C. observed that Doe, in his efforts to escape harm,\nchanged his custody or work assignment 73 times in less than\nfive years. Many of his requests to be transferred to\nadministrative lockdown were made in the early hours of the\nmorning; as other prisoners corroborated, assaults often\noccurred at night. (Again, this striking evidence, like the\nevidence of Doe’s self-harming, was available in the prison\n\n\n  47\n     Cf. LaMarca v. Turner, 662 F. Supp. 647, 686 (S.D. Fla. 1987)\n(“[O]nce an inmate is raped, he is marked as a victim for repeated sexual\nassaults for the remainder of his imprisonment.”), aff’d in part and\nvacated in part on other grounds, 995 F.2d 1526 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\f60                           DOE V.

During their interview, Doe\ntold E.P. that he arranged to be “sent to solitary confinement\nby getting himself written up for failing to obey a directive or\nby deliberately being disrespectful to guards.”48\n\n    As Dr. J.C. put it, “After the assault by [J.J.] and by the\nother strong prisoners, [Doe] had earned the label of ‘galboy’\nand from that point on, lived a ‘cat and mouse game,’\nrepeatedly requesting transfers, protective custody, and\nadministrative lockdown.” E.P. opined that the fact that Doe\n“elected to experience the psychological trauma of solitary\nconfinement to reduce the risk of continued sexual assaults\nunderscores how terrifying and repulsive he found the idea of\nbeing sexually approached and violated by fellow inmates.”\nD.B.F., the professor of criminal justice, concluded that\nDoe’s “constant[] moving reflect[s] that he must have been in\na constant state of fear. . . . I expect [Doe] was one of those\nwho left [the prison] very messed up.”\n\n    Not only did Doe suffer the trauma of sexual\nvictimization and subordination; upon his release, he had to\nface friends and family members who knew of his\n\n\n\n\n  48\n     Another prisoner, P.M., suggested that Doe had deliberately injured\nhimself in order to effectuate a transfer. D.B.F. noted that assignment to\nisolation would have rendered Doe “ineligible for work, recreation, free\ntime on the yard, membership in inmate organizations, or other aspects of\nnormal social interaction.” However, P.R., an inmate counselor who\nreviewed Doe’s files, doubted whether even isolation would have ensured\nhis safety, given that sexual assaults often occurred in that unit as well. He\nsuggested that “[i]n order to have any measure of safety during the\nparticular years [Doe] was here, he would have had to become partners\nwith another inmate for protection.”\n\f                             DOE V.

As one fellow prisoner, A.S., whose sister had told him\nthat Doe had “a lot of trouble on the street because guys had\nheard what happened to him,” put it: “The stigma of all that\nfollowed [Doe] back home . . . .” In a letter to a girlfriend,\nI.R. – one who told D.S. in a taped interview that Doe had\nbeen “fresh meat” from whom other prisoners “got some” –\nDoe wrote: “You told me once I was a whore in there. And\nthat really hurt me . . . . And when you told me that, I just felt\nlike you didn’t have any more respect for me as being a\nman.”\n\n    This evidence is powerful. As another prisoner, A.R.,\nstated in his declaration, “Prison rape is the most devastating\nthing you can experience.”50 Undoubtedly, this evidence\n\n\n   49\n      The (widely corroborated) fact that many of Doe’s friends and\nrelatives knew about the rape makes even more obvious how utterly\ninadequate J.B.’s mitigation investigation was. According to A.S., a\nneighbor, Doe’s own mother knew. She might well have revealed this\ninformation to J.B. or D.S., if they had only asked.\n   50\n      For decades, the federal courts have recognized how powerfully\ndamaging the experience of “confinement in a prison where violence and\nterror reign” would be to a prisoner, in clearly recognizing “a right,\nsecured by the eighth and fourteenth amendments, to be reasonably\nprotected from constant threat of violence and sexual assault by [] fellow\ninmates . . . .” Woodhous v.

A 1994 poll\nfound that 78% of respondents did not accept rape as “part of the price\ncriminals pay for wrongdoing”; 59% thought being raped “constituted a\nviolation of an inmate’s constitutional protection against cruel and unusual\npunishment under the Eighth Amendment” even before the Supreme Court\ndecided the question in Farmer v.

Nor is the horror of\nprison rape recognized only by a political subset of the American\npopulation.

Mental Illness\n\n    The psychological impacts of Doe’s experience in prison\nwere obvious to those who knew him. His ex-girlfriend, I.R.,\nsaid: “I think he was a crazy man. But he wasn’t like that in\nthe beginning [before prison].” A cousin, N.M., said his time\nin prison had “caused [Doe] to go crazy.” Doe was “slipping\nin the head.” A neighbor and friend, A.S., said:\n\n        [Doe] seemed like a troubled young man to\n        me. He was not really all there. . . . It didn’t\n        take a psychiatrist to see there was something\n        eating at [Doe]. . . . [Doe] told me he had\n        problems . . . . I believe in my heart that what\n        happened to [Doe] [in prison] wrecked his\n        mind. The system didn’t help him, it just\n        broke him. Those experiences of being raped\n        are stuck in [Doe]’s head. He would never\n        talk about it and let any of those feelings out.\n\nAnother friend, J.A., put it thus: “He was like people who\ncome back from Vietnam and could never talk about their\ntime there.”52\n\n   52\n      Doe’s mother and aunt also said that he did not talk about his\nexperiences in prison.\n\f64                             DOE V. AYERS\n\n     Behaviorally, Doe was off. “A lot of things he said didn’t\nmake sense” to J.A. He was “extremely jumpy,” “nervous,”\nand “jittery.” He “couldn’t keep still,” “wasn’t sleeping,”\n“would walk around the house all night long,” and was\n“easily upset and agitated.” Sometimes he “would just sit and\nnot speak,” even when spoken to. I.R., who had known him\nall his life and with whom he was romantically involved after\nhis release, believed that he “needed some psychiatric\ncounseling after being confined for five whole years” and that\nperhaps he became “angry over flashbacks.” She said, as Dr.\nJ.C. noted, that “he could go out of control when he was\nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs and it seemed . . . that\n[Doe] has a split personality – that he seemed to be\nschizophrenic. [Doe] could be warm and loving one minute,\nthen the next minute ‘tripped out.’”53\n\n    The impacts of Doe’s trauma did not recede with time. A\nyear and a half after his release, his mother arranged for him\nto see a mental health specialist; the intake sheet noted that\nshe “[r]eport[ed] [Doe] was in [] prison for 6 years and [his\nmother] feels it has done something to him – he’s nervous,\nnot violent . . . .” During intake, he said he was suffering from\n“nerves,” “inappropriate laughter,” “depression/blues,”\n\n\n 53\n      A friend, A.S., reported that after his release,\n\n           [Doe] was very tense and would quickly become\n           agitated and upset over minor irritations. To me it\n           seemed that [Doe] had great difficulty dealing with any\n           pressure or stress. I saw [Doe] fly into a serious rage\n           two or three times. . . . [Doe] never seemed able to\n           control his anger or emotions, much as he wanted to\n           and tried. . . . I would describe [Doe] as schizo, just two\n           completely different people in the same body. Anger\n           would just spew out of [Doe] at times.\n\f                        DOE V.

Doe told\nDr. J.C. that he remembered not caring about anything and\nwanting only to be isolated. It was recommended that he\nattend weekly psychotherapy sessions and Alcoholics\nAnonymous; it seems that he did not.\n\n    After Doe was taken into custody for his current offense,\nhe wrote in a letter to I.R. that the abuse he suffered in prison\n“play[ed] a part in the destruction of my life. But I thought I\nwas handl[ing] it good, until I got out of that hell hole, I was\nso immature, with man’s body, but a young and very\nconfused mind.” He went on to explain that he\n\n        need[ed] someone so bad after all that shit I\n        went through in that man-made hell, but there\n        wasn’t anyone to turn to. I couldn’t turn to\n        you not by you fully respecting me as\n        something happen[ed] to me that you [or] no\n        one would understand. . . . [M]y life was\n        destroy[ed] after doing five years, seven\n        months, and sixteen days in that hell hole . . . .\n\n   Dr. J.C. was able, as an expert, to place Doe’s trauma in\npsychological context. She explained:\n\n        A man who is raped experiences powerful\n        feelings of shame, guilt, and rage; yet, a man\n        who must remain in an environment of\n        continued sexual assault is forced to\n        internalize these feelings in order to play the\n        role that is intended for him and survive the\n\f66                          DOE V. AYERS\n\n         experience. Research suggests that the\n         combination of physical and sexual assault\n         with little recourse to justice, humiliation by\n         both attacker and by others in the prison, and\n         the requirement for continued submission to\n         sexual demands constitutes formidable\n         pressure resulting in severe psychological\n         reactions. These feelings and reactions would\n         have been compounded for [Doe] by his\n         history of being physically dominated by his\n         stronger, more powerful Uncle [J.C.]\n         throughout his childhood and adolescence and\n         by the severe neglect he experienced as an\n         infant at the hands of his mother.\n\n    Dr. J.C. explained that prison left him ravaged by\nsignificant mental illness: “Upon discharge, he was a broken\nman. He suffered from symptoms consistent with Post-\ntraumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD],54 Major Depression,55 and,\n\n\n\n  54\n     The district court mischaracterized Doe’s serious mental illness as\n“extremely mild mental problems.” PTSD is a “grave affliction.” United\nStates v.

Menyweather, 447 F.3d 625, 628, 632 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(recognizing that chronic PTSD symptoms are linked to compulsive\nbehavior and an inability to make reasoned decisions).\n\n     Dr. J.C. explained the distressing symptoms of PTSD, including\nflashbacks, sleep disturbed by nightmares, difficulty concentrating,\nanxiety or fear, panic, anger, feeling the need to defend oneself, and\ndifficulty controlling emotions. She stated:\n\n         Increased arousal is a common response to trauma.\n         Their bodies are on constant alert, always ready to\n         respond immediately to any attack. This includes\n\f                             DOE V.

The victimization [Doe] suffered\n          [in prison], coupled with his traumatic childhood and\n          adolescence, and lack of guidance or modeling in\n          healthy relationships, led to his inability to manage\n          intense negative emotions and his tendency to act out\n          physically in the way he had been taught to act\n          throughout his childhood.\n\nShe also noted that Doe’s substance abuse would “exacerbate [his]\ninability to suppress or control violent behavior.” E.P. gave a similar\nexplanation.\n 55\n      She explained that depression was often a result of trauma:\n\n          Ways of avoiding thoughts, feelings, and sensations\n          associated with trauma can include avoiding\n          conversations, shutting down emotionally or feeling\n          emotionally numb, trouble having loving feelings or\n          feeling any strong emotions, feeling strange or\n          disconnected from the world, feeling weird physical\n          sensations and losing interest in the things one used to\n          enjoy.\n\nShe elaborated:\n\n          People who have experienced trauma often have\n          problems in relationships with others because they have\n          a hard time feeling close to people or trusting them.\n          This is especially likely to happen when the trauma was\n          caused or worsened by people known to the victim (as\n          opposed to an accident or natural disaster).\n\f68                           DOE V. AYERS\n\nin a continued attempt to self-medicate against the pain and\nescape from the daily horror of his memories, quickly\nredeveloped a Poly-substance Dependence.”56 She noted that\nhe “experienced all but one (combat exposure) of the\ntraumatic events most often associated with PTSD in men”:\nchildhood neglect, childhood physical abuse, and rape.57 In\ndiagnosing Doe with Major Depression, Dr. J.C. observed\nthat his depression began in his childhood but was\nexacerbated by his experience in prison.58\n\n\nThis did occur for Doe, as evidenced by the fact that he refused to speak\nabout what happened to him in prison with his aunt, with whom he was\nvery close.\n  56\n      The habeas court also considered the report of a California prison\npsychiatrist who found “evidence of organic brain dysfunction.” The\ndistrict court dismissed this evidence, stating, without support, that “[a]\ndysfunction is less than a disorder, disease, or defect.” However, because\nDoe does not rely on this solitary piece of evidence in his briefing before\nus, and because it is superfluous to our conclusion, we do not consider it\nfurther.\n      57\n       This diagnosis is hardly surprising. See National Prison Rape\nElimination Commission Report 14 (June 2009) (“The psychological\naftereffects of sexual abuse are well documented. They include\nposttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, fear of loud noises or\nsudden movements, panic attacks, and intense flashbacks to the traumatic\nevent. Each of these consequences alone has the ability to re-traumatize\nvictims for years.”); id. at 45 (“The closed nature of correctional facilities\ncan lead to especially devastating effects for sexual abuse victims. . . . The\nconstant threat of subsequent abuse and physical proximity to danger are\nlikely to increase the risk of developing PTSD and other aftereffects. The\nconsequences of sexual abuse may be worse for those who are young,\nhave a past history of sexual abuse, or have a preexisting mental illness.”).\n 58\n   It seems that Doe had a history of depression prior to his incarceration.\nE.P. reported that when Doe’s mother was married to B.G., he became\n“withdrawn, isolated and very depressed, and lost 85 pounds.” Dr. J.C.\n\f                           DOE V. AYERS                              69\n\n    Doe establishes prejudice based on the foregoing\nevidence alone. There is more than a “reasonable probability\nthat, [considering this evidence], the sentencer [i.e., at least\none member of the jury] . . . would have concluded that the\nbalance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not\nwarrant death.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. His experience\nof brutalization as a youngster in prison and resulting mental\nillness are even more powerfully mitigating, however, when\nviewed alongside evidence of his abusive childhood and\nsubstance abuse. Hence, we turn now to those subjects.\n\n               3. Childhood Abuse and Neglect\n\n    As for Doe’s childhood, J.B. did elicit penalty-phase\ntestimony that his father did not support his mother, that his\ngrandmother cared for him while his mother was working,\nthat his uncle abused him physically,59 and that he had\nemotional problems when his mother remarried. This picture\nof Doe’s childhood, however, seriously understated the\nviolence he suffered at the hands of his mother and his uncle,\nand afforded little in the way of mitigation that might be\npersuasive to a jury.\n\n\n\n\nconcluded that Doe had suffered another major depressive episode upon\nhis release from prison, which only worsened after he moved to\nCalifornia.\n   59\n       J.B. did not, however, elicit the painful details. Penalty-phase\ntestimony about Doe’s childhood came only from his mother; she\nmentioned, only briefly, that his uncle would “whip” Doe, and that he\nstarted to beat Doe when he was eleven or twelve. The violence inflicted\non Doe as a child was characterized by J.B., in questioning Doe’s mother,\nas “discipline.”\n\f70                      DOE V. AYERS\n\n    Dr. J.C., who conducted interviews designed to elicit\nevidence of childhood abuse and neglect, learned much more.\nShe reported that Doe’s mother, herself a victim of physical\nand sexual abuse and an abuser of alcohol and drugs, was\n“virtually absent” from his life until he was six years old.\nWhen he was an infant, she abandoned him, sometimes\novernight, to go out drinking. On such occasions, she would\nleave him wrapped in a fur coat, without food or clean clothes\nor diapers. Sometimes, his diapers were not changed for days,\nand became so filthy they were black. Neighbors saw him\ncrawling down the hallway of his apartment, begging for\nsomething to eat. Not only was Doe’s mother neglectful; she\nbeat him with a belt or extension cord.\n\n     In Dr. J.C.’s words, Doe’s “early childhood was in many\nways a continuation of his experience in infancy,” and his\n“transition from childhood to adolescence was filled with\ncontinued neglect by his mother and the other adults in his\nlife.” The testimony the jury heard did not make known that\nDoe was, in fact, raised largely by his violent uncle and\ngrandmother (who once aimed a gun at him) after the age of\none, because his mother was unable to take care of him.\n\n    Doe’s uncle singled him out, repeatedly beating him\nthroughout his childhood years, unpredictably and for no\nreason, with his fists and with sticks, sometimes on the head.\nHe punched Doe in the head if he came home slightly late or\ndid something perceived to be disrespectful. He once knocked\nDoe off a ladder, and kicked him in the head as he lay on the\nground until he lost consciousness. On another occasion, he\npounded Doe’s head into a telephone pole. Another time, he\ntried to run Doe over with a car. Even after Doe was released\nfrom prison, his uncle still beat him, once with a large shovel.\n\f                          DOE V. AYERS                             71\n\nDoe wrote in a letter that he was “lucky the man didn’t kill\nme . . . .”\n\n    This evidence, too, would have been powerful. “It is well\nestablished that early childhood trauma, even if it is not\nconsciously remembered, may have catastrophic and\npermanent effects on those who . . . survive it.’” Stankewitz,\n698 F.3d at 1169 (citation omitted).\n\n                      4. Substance Abuse\n\n    J.B. also did not present evidence of Doe’s serious\nsubstance abuse at the penalty phase of his trial. While this\nfailure alone would not have prejudiced Doe, the evidence\nwould have helped to sway the jury towards life when\nconsidered cumulatively, alongside the other mitigating\nevidence.60 Here, as Dr. J.C. explained, mitigation based on\nDoe’s substance abuse would not simply have been additive.\nRather, the evidence of his escalating dependence would have\namplified the mitigating force of Doe’s repeated trauma in\nprison, which drove him to “continued attempt[s] to self-\nmedicate against the pain and escape from the daily horror of\nhis memories.” Cf. Ainsworth, 268 F.3d at 876 (concluding\nthat failure to present evidence of substance abuse at the\npenalty phase was prejudicial, and noting expert testimony\nthat the petitioner “used drugs as a form of self-medication\nbecause he lacked any other means of overcoming or even\ncoping with his unbearable inner experience”).\n\n\n\n\n  60\n    There is also evidence that substance abuse was pervasive in Doe’s\nimmediate and extended family, and that he was exposed to alcohol and\ndrugs at a young age.\n\f72                           DOE V. AYERS\n\n    A.S., who lived for many years in the same neighborhood\nas Doe’s family and met him after his release from prison,\nreported that “most nights I saw [Doe] drink between seven\nand nine half-pints of hard liquor [and, when he was able to\npour his own drinks,] even more.” He added that “he just kept\ndrinking more and more . . . which usually made him more\nirrational and easily upset. By the time [Doe] left for\nCalifornia, his drinking problem was enormous and he\nseemed extremely unstable.”61\n\n    Doe told E.P. that “after his release from prison he felt\nprofoundly depressed and anxious, which he tried to\novercome by drinking alcohol to keep numb.” E.P. explained,\nas an expert witness could have at trial, that “[t]he resort to\n\n\n 61\n    Exactly which drugs he used and when is less clear. Doe told D.S. that\nhe smoked marijuana occasionally – which contributed to his leaving\nschool – and did two grams of cocaine per weekend after his release from\nprison. D.S. noted that while Doe was twice supposed to attend substance\nabuse treatment programs, he never did so. E.P. reviewed a statement by\na classmate of Doe’s, who said that Doe regularly used alcohol, marijuana,\nand prescription pills, and that he saw Doe snort suede cleaner. Dr. J.C.\nwas informed that Doe consumed a variety of other, harder drugs. Though\nthe list Dr. J.C. reported is longer, Dr. M.R. learned from Doe, before his\ntrial, that he had used marijuana, barbituates, tranquilizers, and cocaine.\n\n     The state argues that the statements of some witnesses as to Doe’s\nsubstance abuse are unreliable and perhaps exaggerated. However, the\nevidence of Doe’s substance abuse would have been useful to the jury not\nto explain an intoxicated state that precipitated the crime, as in Mayfield\nv. Woodford, 270 F.3d 915 (9th Cir. 2001), the case the district court and\nstate both cite, but rather to help the jurors understand that Doe had\nunsuccessfully attempted to self-medicate. Cf. id. at 931 n.17 (“[J]uries are\nunlikely to favor defenses based on abuse of dangerous drugs in\nevaluating a defendant’s culpability for violent behavior.” (emphasis\nadded)). Hence, the precise details of his substance abuse are not critical\nto the prejudice inquiry.\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                                73\n\ndrugs and alcohol as a means of coping with pain is common\namong people who are depressed and among people who\nhave experienced significant trauma.” He observed that Doe\n“retreated into a continual drug and alcohol haze that helped\nhim to turn off the recurring traumatic thoughts. Trauma is\noften most effectively treated through a combination of\npsychological counseling and psychotropic medications, none\nof which were available to [Doe].”\n\n    Evidence about Doe’s childhood would have\ndemonstrated to the jury that the trauma he suffered in prison\nwas not isolated, but rather the most disturbing of multiple\nepisodes in a horrific series that stretched back to his birth.\nEvidence about his substance abuse would have highlighted\nhis inability to cope with his violation in prison. We have\nconcluded that the evidence of Doe’s repeated rape in prison\nand its detrimental effects on his mental health is sufficient to\nestablish prejudice; this additional mitigating evidence, which\nJ.B. likewise failed to present, only strengthens that\nconclusion.62\n\n\n\n\n   62\n      Like materiality in the Brady context, prejudice resulting from\nineffective assistance of counsel must be “considered collectively, not\nitem by item.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 436 (1995); see also Silva,\n279 F.3d at 834 (“[C]umulative prejudice from trial counsel’s deficiencies\nmay amount to sufficient grounds for a finding of ineffectiveness of\ncounsel.”). This is particularly true when, as here, the different pieces of\nmitigating evidence fit together into an internally coherent and compelling\nnarrative whole. As E.P. put it, after assessing Doe, “The trauma inflicted\non [Doe] [in prison] built upon the trauma from his childhood – the\nparental neglect, the beatings by [Doe’s] Uncle [J.C.], the depression, the\nsubstance abuse. [Doe] entered [prison] a depressed, traumatized,\naddictive young man and left as a severely more compromised\nindividual.”\n\f74                           DOE V. AYERS\n\n                 D. Comparison to Other Cases\n\n    The determination whether a petitioner was prejudiced by\nhis lawyer’s failure to discover and present mitigating\nevidence is an inherently fact-intensive inquiry, and requires\nclose consideration of individual records, rather than\noversimplified, ordinal comparisons between summaries of\nthe suffering experienced by capital defendants. Such\njudgments are “uniquely moral decision[s] in which bright\nline rules have a limited place.” Hendricks, 70 F.3d at 1044.\n\n    That said, our finding of prejudice to Doe is indeed\nsupported by just such a comparison; we have found\nprejudice in other similar cases. See Douglas, 316 F.3d at\n1088–90 (mitigation not presented at trial included evidence\nthat the defendant was raised by an alcoholic foster father\nwho locked him in a closet, had to scavenge for food, was\nbeaten and gang-raped by other prisoners when he was a\nteenager, was decorated in the Marines, suffered a head\ninjury, and consumed a lot of alcohol); see also Karis v.\nCalderon, 283 F.3d 1117, 1137–41 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(mitigation not presented at trial included evidence that the\n\n\n     Had J.B. conducted an adequate mitigation investigation, he would,\nby his own admission, have presented a very different story: one of\nsignificant childhood abuse and neglect, compounded by the trauma of\nrepeated sexual victimization and subjugation beginning at the age of 17,\nand leading to significant mental health problems and efforts to self-\nmedicate. It is well recognized that the mitigating factors present in Doe’s\ncase are characteristically interrelated. See National Prison Rape\nElimination Commission Report 47 (June 2009) (“Individuals dealing with\nthe consequences of sexual abuse may find it difficult to reintegrate into\nsociety, relate to their families, and rebuild their lives. Some self-medicate\nwith alcohol and drugs to escape emotional or physical suffering. Some\nturn back to crime, become homeless, or reenter the criminal justice\nsystem.”).\n\f                           DOE V.

[and] that he\nlikely suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder” as well\nas a brain disorder stemming from alcohol and drug abuse);\nJackson, 211 F.3d 1148, 1163 (9th Cir. 2000) (mitigation not\npresented at trial included evidence that the defendant\n“suffered repeated beatings in childhood, and that his mother\nchoked him when angry with him,” that his “childhood and\nadolescence were characterized by neglect and instability,”\nand that he “exhibited signs of mental illness” as a child);63\nHendricks, 70 F.3d at 1037, 1044 (mitigation not presented at\ntrial included evidence of the defendant’s “alleged history as\na victim of sexual abuse and possible genetic predisposition\nto various psychiatric disorders,” “hard childhood, [and] drug\nproblems”); cf. Miles v. Ryan, 713 F.3d 477, 492–93 (9th Cir.\n2012) (declining to find prejudice in a case where the\ndefendant may have observed violence in connection with his\nmother’s work as a prostitute during his childhood, but there\nwas no evidence that he himself was abused or neglected).\n\n    In a leading case, the Supreme Court found that the\npetitioner, Wiggins, was prejudiced by his defense counsel’s\nfailure to present evidence that he “experienced severe\n\n\n 63\n    Jackson’s lawyer also failed to present medical evidence going to his\nability to think clearly at the time he committed the crime.

AYERS\n\nprivation and abuse in the first six years of his life while in\nthe custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother.” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 534–35. It added that he “suffered physical\ntorment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape,” and had been\nhomeless. Id. at 535. In another case, the Supreme Court\nfound that the petitioner, Rompilla, was prejudiced by his\ndefense counsel’s failure to discover that he was raised by\nparents with serious drinking problems who fought violently,\nthat his father “beat him when he was young with his hands,\nfists, leather straps, belts and sticks,” that he received verbal\nabuse rather than expressions of affection, and that he lived\nin squalor.64 Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 391–93. Although Doe’s\nlife was, of course, different than Wiggins’s and Rompilla’s,\nhe, too, clearly “has the kind of troubled history we have\ndeclared relevant to assessing a defendant’s moral\nculpability.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535.\n\n         VI. Causal Nexus and Rebuttal Evidence\n\n    The state offers two additional arguments against our\nconclusion that J.B.’s deficient penalty-phase performance\nprejudiced Doe.\n\n    First, it argues that J.B.’s failure to introduce evidence of\nthe abuse Doe suffered – both as a child and in prison –\ncannot have prejudiced him because this evidence could not\n\n 64\n     Rompilla also had organic brain damage. Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 392.\nHowever, there is no indication that this was a determinative factor in the\nSupreme Court’s analysis, or even – buried as it is in a list of other\nunintroduced mitigating evidence – that it was more significant than any\nof the rest of it. To assume otherwise would be to assume, contrary to the\nSupreme Court’s express statements, that penalty-phase mitigating\nevidence will carry weight only when it offers a causative explanation for\nthe offense.\n\f                         DOE V. AYERS                          77\n\nhave explained why he committed the offense. This argument\nfails both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. The\ndeclarations of the two psychological experts retained by\nhabeas counsel would have offered jurors a way to\nunderstand (though of course not to justify) Doe’s aggression\nas the product of repeated brutalization that left him suffering\nfrom PTSD. Additionally, both we and the Supreme Court\nhave recognized that while demonstrating such a causative\n“nexus” between painful life experiences and the commission\nof the offense is one way in which mitigating evidence can be\nexpected to alter a sentencing outcome, it is certainly not the\nonly one. Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274, 286–87 (2004);\nsee also Smith v. Texas, 543 U.S. 37, 45 (2004) (stating that\nthe nexus test is a test that the Supreme Court “never\ncountenanced and now ha[s] unequivocally rejected,” and that\nthis holding was “plain under [its] precedents”); Styers v.\nSchriro, 547 F.3d 1026, 1035 (9th Cir. 2008) (“In applying\nthis type of nexus test to conclude that [the defendant’s] post\ntraumatic stress disorder did not qualify as mitigating\nevidence, the Arizona Supreme [C]ourt appears to have\nimposed a test directly contrary to the constitutional\nrequirement that all relevant mitigating evidence be\nconsidered by the sentencing body.”).\n\n    Unlike at the guilt phase, where the primary focus is on\nevidence offering a causative explanation, which might\nreduce formal culpability, mitigating evidence at the penalty\nphase also serves to increase jurors’ sympathy for or\ncomprehension of the lives, and crimes, of defendants who\nhave themselves suffered terribly. Sears, 561 U.S. at 951. It\nis well established that “[w]hile the question of innocence or\nguilt of the offense is essentially a question of fact, the choice\nbetween life imprisonment and capital punishment is both a\nquestion of underlying fact and a matter of reasoned moral\n\f78                          DOE V. AYERS\n\njudgment.” Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 370 (1992).\n“Evidence regarding social background and mental health,”\nsuch as the evidence that J.B. failed to present, is necessary\nto allow jurors to exercise reasoned moral judgment.\nDouglas, 316 F.3d at 1090. “Only then can we be sure that\nthe sentencer has treated the defendant as a ‘uniquely\nindividual human bein[g]’ and has made a reliable\ndetermination that death is the appropriate sentence.” Penry,\n492 U.S. at 319 (quoting Woodson, 428 U.S. at 304).\n\n    Second, the state argues that the strength of the mitigating\nevidence that went unheard at trial should be discounted to\nthe extent that it would have opened the door to potentially\ndamaging rebuttal evidence.65 There are three specific pieces\nof evidence at issue, suggesting but offering no proof that\nDoe had himself committed sexual assaults. All three would\nlikely have been inadmissible, and none would have been\ninconsistent with the mitigation evidence discussed above.\n\n    The first is a warrant issued for Doe’s arrest in his home\nstate in connection with a rape; he was never arrested,\ncharged or convicted. The bare fact that Doe was suspected\nof rape did in fact come in during the penalty phase of the\n\n\n 65\n    The state actually makes two arguments about this rebuttal evidence.\nThe first is that it would serve to counterbalance the unintroduced\nmitigating evidence, thereby limiting prejudice. The second goes instead\nto the first prong of the ineffective assistance analysis: the deficiency of\nJ.B.’s performance. The state suggests that had he known about both the\nmitigating evidence and the rebuttal evidence it might draw, he would\nhave chosen to put on only the same limited mitigation presentation he\noffered at trial. When asked about this during the habeas hearing, J.B. said\nthat this rebuttal evidence would not have made it more difficult for him\nto present evidence of Doe’s victimization to the jury. We see no reason\nto second-guess his assessment.\n\f                       DOE V. AYERS                        79\n\ntrial, in order to rebut a character witness. The trial judge\nexcluded all details of the alleged offense, which the state\nsought to introduce in order to rebut evidence of his good\ncharacter – a purpose for which it would, at least, have been\nrelevant.\n\n    We doubt whether this evidence, ruled inadmissible for\nthe purpose of demonstrating Doe’s bad character, would\nhave been admissible to rebut the mitigating evidence related\nto his rape in prison, because evidence that Doe might have\nbeen the perpetrator of a rape outside of prison would have\ndone nothing to undermine a showing that he himself had\nbeen the victim of rape in prison. See People v. Mitcham, 824\nP.2d 1277, 1308 (Cal. 1992) (in bank) (“[W]e caution[] . . .\nthat the scope of rebuttal must be specific, and evidence\npresented or argued as rebuttal must relate directly to a\nparticular incident or character trait defendant offers in his\nown behalf . . . .” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The\nalready-materialized risk that the jury would hear that Doe\nwas accused of rape would not have dissuaded counsel from\npresenting additional mitigation, nor would it have\nsubstantially undermined that presentation. See Correll,\n539 F.3d at 955 (rejecting the argument that because the\nprosecution could have presented “very damaging evidence\nin rebuttal,” defense counsel’s failure to present mitigating\nevidence was not prejudicial, because “a significant portion\nof that damaging rebuttal evidence was already available\nthrough the pre-sentence report”).\n\n    The second piece of rebuttal evidence is a two-page\ndocument from Doe’s prison file, reflecting that he received\na disciplinary infraction for being a member (though not a\nleader) of a group of prisoners allegedly involved in forcing\nothers in a particular unit to engage in sexual acts. The form\n\f80                       DOE V. AYERS\n\nattributes these assaults to the group as a whole, and includes\nno statements about particular incidents nor about any\nspecific acts of Doe’s. This is the only allegation of such\nbehavior in his voluminous prison file, and is substantiated by\nno other evidence. The state’s brief refers to it, tellingly, as an\n“indication.” The third piece of evidence is the mention in a\nprobation report that during Doe’s detention in a California\njail prior to his murder trial, another prisoner asked to be\nmoved, alleging that Doe propositioned him for sex and\nthreatened to initiate sex without consent. There is no\nsuggestion that anything further occurred, and his “[i]nmate\nrecords reflect no disciplinary action was taken on this\ninstance.”\n\n    Though these latter two pieces of evidence are perhaps\nmore likely to have been admissible on relevance grounds, as\nthey concern sexual abuse Doe allegedly perpetrated while\nconfined, their unreliability might well have barred their\nintroduction. See People v. Martinez, 74 P.3d 748, 762 (Cal.\n2003). Even if this evidence was properly admissible, the jury\nwould likely have given it little weight, given that neither of\nthe reports was detailed or supported by any additional\nevidence, Doe’s role in the first incident was very unclear,\nand the second report did not even allege an actual assault.\n\n    Furthermore, it is well known that sexual abuse can beget\nsexual abuse. Suggestions that Doe became sexually\naggressive after being raped would actually have supported,\nnot contradicted, the testimony of Dr. J.C. and E.P. about the\neffect of the trauma Doe suffered on his behavior, and the\nevidence in multiple declarations about the power structure in\nprison that he was forced to learn, in order to survive. Both\nexperts reported that people who are raped in prison often act\nout sexually; the fact that such prisoners often attempt to\n\f                              DOE V.

AYERS\n\nrisk of rebuttal.69 We conclude that there is at least a\nreasonable probability that after considering this mitigating\nand rebuttal evidence, the jury would have decided that Doe\nshould not be executed.\n\n                           VII. Conclusion\n\n    Doe received profoundly deficient assistance of counsel\nduring the penalty phase of his trial: while very strong\nmitigating evidence existed, it was never uncovered by J.B.,\nand the resulting presentation was so anemic as to be virtually\nwithout value. These failures were due, defense counsel\nreadily admits, not to any sort of strategic judgment but rather\nto incompetence.\n\n    In some cases, we have found that although defense\ncounsel’s investigation was inadequate, the evidence he\nwould have discovered would have been, though extensive,\nlargely duplicative. See, e.g., Miles, 713 F.3d at 492–93\n(“Petitioner’s additional social history is, as the district court\n\n\n  69\n     Cf. Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U.S. 15, 17, 19–26 (2009) (holding that\na capital defendant could not show prejudice because his lawyer decided\nnot to present mitigating evidence that was largely duplicative of the\nsubstantial quantity of penalty-phase evidence already presented, after\nbeing warned explicitly by the trial judge that doing so would open the\ndoor to the introduction of extensive and compelling evidence that his\nclient had committed – and boasted about – another, execution-style,\nmurder); Allen v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 979, 984–85 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(holding that unintroduced mitigating evidence of questionable value and\noffered by easily impeached witnesses was insufficient to outweigh “the\nextraordinarily damaging aggravating evidence . . . that [the defendant]\nhad just been convicted by his death-qualified jury of orchestrating – from\njail – a conspiracy to murder seven people, and succeeding in the actual\nkilling of three, all to retaliate for their prior testimony against him and to\nprevent future damaging testimony . . . .”).\n\f                           DOE V. AYERS                              83\n\nnoted, largely cumulative of what was already before the\nsentencing judge in the [pre-sentence report], meaning that its\nmitigating value would be marginal.”). However, the jury that\nsentenced Doe was utterly unaware of his brutalization in\nprison and resulting mental illness, as well as the abuse and\nneglect he suffered during childhood. This unintroduced\nevidence, far from being duplicative, would have radically\naltered the mitigation presentation at trial.\n\n    In Doe’s case, the evidence procured and introduced by\nhabeas counsel “adds up to a mitigation case that bears no\nrelation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before\nthe jury.”70 Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393. “[A]lthough we\nsuppose it is [hypothetically] possible that a jury could have\nheard it all and still have decided on the death penalty, that is\nnot the test.” Id. The jury at Doe’s trial was presented with\nrelatively weak evidence in aggravation, and little evidence\nin mitigation, and chose death. Had J.B. conducted an\nadequate investigation, the jury would have heard, instead, an\nextremely compelling mitigation presentation (and little if\nany additional evidence in aggravation). “[T]he discrepancy\n\n  70\n     This is indeed how the prosecutor characterized J.B.’s mitigation\npresentation at closing argument:\n\n         I don’t think you are going to hear any strong argument\n         from the defense that you have heard evidence that\n         mitigates the murder of [L.R.]. I don’t think you are\n         going to be able to find that you have heard anything,\n         any factors in mitigation that can outweigh the factors\n         in aggravation. I think what you are going to hear is a\n         plea for mercy.\n\n     J.B. did not dispute it: “Ladies and gentlemen, [the prosecutor] is\nright. I am going to plead for to you [sic] choose life. I am going plead\n[sic]. I do plead for you to choose life.”\n\f84                       DOE V. AYERS\n\nbetween what counsel did investigate and present and what\ncounsel could have investigated and presented” was massive.\nStankewitz, 365 F.3d at 716. It is far more likely than not that\nthe jury would have been swayed, resulting in a failure to\nimpose a sentence of death. Especially given that AEDPA\ndoes not apply to this case, it is not a close one. Doe was\nprejudiced by J.B.’s failure to investigate and present\nmitigating evidence.\n\n    Upon learning of the evidence he failed to discover in\nrepresenting Doe – his first capital client – J.B., to his credit,\nacknowledged as much:\n\n        [M]y investigation and my representation of\n        [Doe] at the penalty phase of his trial were\n        inadequate. I believe that a compelling\n        argument could and should have been made to\n        a jury on his behalf that his life should not be\n        taken by the State of California. It appears\n        that his family’s multi-generational history of\n        abuse and neglect had continued, and it was\n        inflicted upon [Doe] virtually from the time of\n        his conception and continued through\n        childhood and into adolescence.

Introduction\n\n   In 1984, a house in California was burglarized and a\nnumber of items were stolen. K.H. and M.H. resided there\nwith M.H.’s young children, a live-in babysitter, L.R., and her\ndaughter. Petitioner John Doe,1 who was living at the time in\na vacant house adjacent to the property, was arrested in\nconnection with the burglary, but then released.\n\n    Soon after, while K.H. and M.H. were not at home, their\nhouse was burglarized again. L.R. was murdered, having been\nbeaten, stabbed, and strangled. Her body was found supine on\nthe bed in the master bedroom, with her hands bound behind\nher back. She was naked from the waist down, with her legs\nopen, and a vibrator near her body. A number of items were\nstolen.\n\n\n    1\n    In this case, we discuss disturbing evidence of sexual abuse suffered\nby the Petitioner. Because of the possibility that publication of this\ninformation might place him at risk in a prison environment, much of the\nrecord in this habeas proceeding was filed under seal. However, this case\nturns on the weight of the evidence that trial counsel failed to discover and\npresent; it is powerful in large part because of the painful details. After\nconsidering the views of the parties, we have ordered the record unsealed\nfor the limited purpose of discussing the evidence in this opinion, but have\nreplaced Petitioner’s name with Doe and the names of others with initials.\nWe have also omitted citations to the procedural history of this case.\n\f                              DOE V. AYERS                                     5\n\n    After an investigation, Doe was arrested. He was charged\nwith one count of murder and two counts of burglarizing the\nhome. Special circumstances of felony-murder-burglary and\nfelony-murder-rape were alleged; also alleged was a prior\nfelony conviction for an armed robbery committed in the\nSouthern state where Doe grew up. J.B., who had never\nbefore worked on a case in which the death penalty was at\nissue, was appointed to represent Doe.2 He hired an\ninvestigator, D.S., who interviewed potential witnesses in\nCalifornia and in Doe’s home state.3\n\n    Doe pleaded not guilty to the charges and denied the\nallegations. The jury returned verdicts finding Doe guilty of\nmurder and both counts of burglary. The jury also rendered\na finding of true on the felony-murder-burglary special-\ncircumstance allegation, and a finding of not true on the\nfelony-murder-rape special-circumstance allegation. At the\npenalty phase, the jury returned a sentence of death.4\n\n\n 2\n   J.B. also stated that he had “never observed the penalty phase of a trial\nor mock trial.”\n  3\n    For the sake of clarity, we include a brief timeline of Doe’s life and\ncriminal history. He grew up in the South. In 1976, at the age of 17, he\nwas convicted of robbery and incarcerated in a state prison. He was\nreleased in 1982. By 1983, Doe had moved to California; he was\nconvicted of murder there in 1984.\n 4\n   In California, a capital trial consists of two phases. In the first, the guilt\nphase, the jury decides whether the defendant committed murder and also\nwhether one of a number of special circumstances applies. If the jury\ndetermines that the defendant is guilty and that one of the special\ncircumstances applies in the case, a separate penalty phase commences.\nIn that phase, the jury weighs aggravating and mitigating evidence to\ndetermine whether the death penalty is appropriate.

AYERS\n\n    The California Supreme Court denied Doe’s direct appeal,\nand the Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court also denied Doe’s habeas petition,\ntwice.\n\n    Doe filed a federal habeas petition, which was also\ndenied. The district court affirmed the conviction, rejecting a\nnumber of guilt-phase challenges. As for Doe’s claim that he\nhad received ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty\nphase of his trial, the court found that counsel for Doe had\nperformed deficiently in failing to investigate and present\nvarious categories of mitigating evidence. However, the\ndistrict court concluded that Doe could not establish that he\nhad been prejudiced as a result, as required under Strickland\nv. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695 (1984).\n\n    We agree with the district court that Doe is not entitled to\nreversal of his conviction on the basis of the claims presented\nin the petition before us. With respect to the penalty-phase\nclaim, we agree that defense counsel was ineffective but\ndisagree with the conclusion that Doe was not prejudiced.\nAccordingly, we affirm Doe’s conviction but reverse as to his\nsentence, and instruct the district court to grant the writ.\n\n\n\n\nCourt has long recognized that such bifurcated trials serve an important\nrole in ensuring that “the determination of punishment [in capital cases]\n. . . reflect[s] ‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of\na maturing society[,]’” because “[m]uch of the information that is relevant\nto the sentencing decision may have no relevance to the question of guilt,\nor may even be extremely prejudicial to a fair determination of that\nquestion.” Gregg v.

Guilt-Phase Claims\n\n    In the petition before us, Doe raises a number of\nchallenges to his conviction, all of which were rejected by the\ndistrict court. We discuss these claims only briefly, as we\nagree with the result reached by the district court.\n\f8                       DOE V. AYERS\n\n                        A. Rule 60(b)\n\n    First, Doe asserts that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying his motion to vacate the judgment in\nwhich it denied his habeas petition under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(b). Doe requested relief under Rule 60(b) based on newly\ndiscovered physical evidence that was in the possession of the\nstate. He alleges that the state withheld from his prior habeas\ncounsel DNA and fingerprint evidence from the crime scene\nand from a related murder that it tested post-trial and was not\na match to Doe. He also alleges that his prior habeas counsel\nwas negligent in failing to pursue claims based on this\nevidence once she learned of it.\n\n    Doe’s Rule 60(b) claims have a complicated procedural\nhistory:\n\n    In March 2005, while the present petition was still\npending before the district court, Doe sent a letter to the court\nstating that he no longer wanted his appointed attorneys to\ncontinue to represent him, in part because they refused to\ninvestigate his claims of actual innocence. Two weeks after\nhe reiterated that request in June, the district court denied\nDoe’s request, and simultaneously denied his habeas petition.\nDoe appealed the denial of his motion for substitution of\ncounsel, and we appointed new (present) habeas counsel, who\nfiled his Rule 60(b) motion; the district court denied it. After\nconsolidating Doe’s appeals, we held that the district court\nhad abused its discretion in denying Doe’s request for\nsubstitution of counsel. We vacated the district court’s denial\nof this request, together with its denial of Doe’s petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus, and remanded for further proceedings\nin which Doe’s newly-appointed counsel would have the\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                                9\n\nopportunity to make additional submissions to the district\ncourt.\n\n    The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed.5 It\nconcluded that we had erred in holding that the district court\nabused its discretion in rejecting Doe’s request for new\ncounsel. In so doing, it noted that the evidence at issue “might\nhave established a Brady claim, a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel for failure to adequately investigate the\nmurder, or a claim of innocence, especially given that no\nphysical evidence tied Doe to the crime and that he was\nconvicted based in part on recanted testimony. The Court\nwent on to say, however, that all of those claims would have\nbeen new, and that as the district court subsequently found in\nruling on the Rule 60(b) motion, the physical evidence was\nnot related to the claims previously presented in Doe’s habeas\npetition. Because these claims were new claims for relief on\nthe merits, and did not attack a defect in the integrity of the\nproceedings, Doe was required to raise them not in a Rule\n60(b) motion, but in a successive habeas petition.

AYERS\n\nsubsequently granted the right to file a second or successive\npetition.\n\n            B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n     Second, Doe alleges that his trial counsel, J.B., provided\nineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of his\ntrial. J.B.’s performance at the guilt phase of Doe’s trial was\ncertainly subpar. He failed to interview two young children\nwho were the only eyewitnesses to the murder and who, in\ninitial police reports, identified the killer as white (Doe is\nblack). Although the failure to even interview the only\neyewitnesses to the crime was unquestionably deficient\nperformance, J.B. did offer a couple of reasonable\njustifications for his decision not to put them on as witnesses:\nthe children appeared unreliable, and the prosecutor agreed\nnot to tell the jury that children were present at the time of the\nmurder if J.B. did not call them to testify.7\n\n    J.B. also failed to follow up on a potential alibi witness,\nC.L., with whom Doe claimed that he had gone drinking the\nnight of the murder. During an interview with D.S., C.L. said\nthat it was more likely than not that Doe was with him at a\nlocal bar on the night of the murder, given that the murder\noccurred on a Thursday and C.L. and Doe always went out\ndrinking on Thursday nights. Because C.L. had no specific\nrecollection of that particular evening, he told D.S. that he\nwould attempt to find more definite support for the alibi. D.S.\nprovided J.B. with a copy of a report summarizing his\ninterview with C.L.; however, J.B. never attempted to contact\n\n\n  7\n    It also appears the J.B. may have wanted to avoid traumatizing the\nchildren, which would not have been a legitimate reason for deciding not\nto call them.\n\f                              DOE V. AYERS                         11\n\nC.L. again until, just before trial, when he tried to subpoena\nhim as a trial witness.8 Then, when service was initially\nunsuccessful, J.B. made no further attempt to track him down.\nJ.B. also acted in an objectively unreasonable way when he\nfailed to call a blood spatter expert who stated in his report\nthat had Doe committed the murder, he would have been\nspattered with blood. J.B. never asserted a strategic reason for\nnot calling the blood spatter expert, and the arguments raised\nby the state to undermine the probative value of this evidence\n(suggesting that Doe would have had time to wash the blood\noff, and that the witness who spent time with him later that\nevening did not see him in bright light) provide no reason not\nto present this testimony.\n\n    Additionally, Doe argues that J.B. failed to investigate\nand challenge the reliability of one of the state’s witnesses,\nP.F., a girlfriend-turned-informant who testified that she\nbumped into Doe the night of the murder, that he left her\nalone during the time the crime was committed, and that he\nreturned with a bit of blood on his hand and carrying\ndistinctive items stolen from the home in which L.R. was\nkilled. P.F. testified that he told her that he had “just finished\nbeating up a woman.” Later, she taped a conversation with\nDoe, during which he made inculpatory statements.\n\n    There was good reason to doubt the reliability of P.F.’s\ntestimony. Two women who knew her told D.S. that she had\na reputation for lying. However, neither D.S. nor J.B.\ninterviewed B.P., one of the two people P.F. said she had\nbeen walking with when she encountered Doe that evening.\nWhen contacted later by habeas counsel, B.P. contradicted\nP.F.’s story, stating convincingly that she knew she had not\n\n 8\n     J.B. never asserted a strategic reason for not calling C.L.\n\f12                     DOE V. AYERS\n\nbeen out with P.F. that night. P.F. had been in a bicycling\naccident shortly prior to the date of the crime, and a number\nof people stated in declarations that she had suffered from\nsignificant memory loss for months. P.F. essentially admitted\nin a declaration that, because she was still recovering from\nthe accident, she could not have been with Doe on the night\nof the murder. It also appears that she was suffering cognitive\ndeficits resulting from the combination of a medication and\nalcohol. Doe argues that in addition to impeaching P.F. based\non her reputation for dishonesty and cognitive deficits, J.B.\nshould have asked her about the extent to which the police\nappear to have helped her fill holes in her memory.\n\n     However, J.B. did impeach P.F. to a significant degree.\nHe elicited testimony about the seriousness of her head injury\nand the fact that she was taking medication and drinking\nalcohol on the night of the murder. He also elicited testimony\nthat she had previously made false statements. He\ndemonstrated that the moon was not full, as she had stated,\nthe night of the murder, and that items she claimed to have\nseen that night in the vacant house had been removed\npreviously. Finally, he prompted her to admit that she had not\ninitially remembered the date of her interaction with Doe, and\nthat the police had supplied her with it. We agree with the\ndistrict court that while J.B. could have done a much better\njob of impeaching P.F., his efforts in this respect were not\nconstitutionally inadequate. The additional impeachment\nevidence would have been largely cumulative, albeit stronger,\nbut the failures regarding impeachment of P.F. are of\ncomparatively little consequence, as the most important\nportion of her testimony was the introduction of her recorded\nconversation with Doe that served to corroborate the\ncircumstantial evidence of his guilt.\n\f                             DOE V. AYERS                                13\n\n    Lastly, Doe asserts that J.B. should have introduced\nevidence that K.H. was dealing drugs out of his home, that he\nhad argued with L.R. shortly before her death and had\npreviously assaulted someone, that neighbors reported\ndomestic problems, and that L.R. had expressed to M.H. her\nfear that her wild life would end before her next birthday. The\nstate is correct that evidence suggesting K.H.’s culpability\nwould have been excluded under People v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160040\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160040/people-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 833 (1986), because for third party evidence to come in,\nit must demonstrate more than “mere motive or opportunity.”\nAs for the evidence going more generally to the dangerous\ncircumstances in which the victim lived, we do not believe it\nwould have created significant doubt in the minds of the\njurors.\n\n    J.B. certainly did not provide high-quality representation\nto Doe at the guilt phase of his trial. However, he had a\nstrategic justification for not calling the child witnesses.\nWhile he offered no such justification for his failure to follow\nup with the alibi witness, call the blood spatter expert, or\ndemonstrate the dangerous environment in which the victim\nlived, it appears that none of this evidence would have been\nparticularly persuasive. Failing to impeach P.F., the\nprosecution’s most important witness, would have been a\nvery serious error, but J.B. did offer substantial impeachment\nevidence. Hence, we conclude that Doe has not shown\nprejudice.\n\n    Decisively, the prosecution’s strongest evidence – which\nis not addressed by any of the claims Doe raises here9 – was\n\n\n 9\n   Doe also claims that J.B. was ineffective for his failure to help the jury\ncorrectly interpret his statements on this recording. However, J.B. did in\nfact suggest to the jury that Doe might have made such statements in an\n\f14                          DOE V. AYERS\n\nthe taped conversation between him and his girlfriend, P.F.,\nduring which, as the state argues, Doe made inculpatory\nstatements. While Doe at one point denied involvement and\nnever explicitly confessed, he made a number of very\ndamning statements in regard to the murder. He warned:\n“They can’t prove a motherfuckin’ thing, not unless you open\nyour motherfuckin’ mouth.” He added: “Baby what you fail\nto realize, how the motherfuckers they gonna prove I was\nthere? . . . There ain’t no motherfuckin’ fingerprints, ain’t no\nfuckin’ where in there, and ain’t no fuckin’ body seen me go\nin there and leave out of there.” In response to a request to\ntell her “what the fuck happened over there,” he said: “Why\nshould I, so you can go back and tell [the police?]” When she\nstated that she had seen blood on him that night, he replied,\n“Ain’t on me no more.” Because of the strength of this\nevidence, we conclude that even if J.B. had performed\nadequately, there is not a reasonable probability that the jury\nwould have acquitted Doe of murder.\n\n                              C. Batson\n\n    Third, Doe claims that the prosecutor at his trial used\nperemptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner, and\nthat J.B. was ineffective for his failure to raise an objection.\nFour black veniremembers remained after excuses for\nhardship and death qualification; two were struck by the\nprosecutor, a third was removed for cause, and the remaining\none was empaneled. Doe contends that J.B. was ineffective\nfor failing to challenge these strikes under Batson v.\nKentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). In fact, J.B. did raise such a\n\n\neffort to end the conversation. While the other “interpretive lens[es]” Doe\nproposes could possibly have been helpful at trial, J.B.’s performance in\nthis respect was not unreasonable.\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              15\n\nchallenge, demanding reasons before the black jurors were\nstruck, but the trial court ruled – correctly – that it was\npremature. For reasons passing understanding, J.B. never\nrenewed his request after the black jurors were removed from\nthe venire. This failure made it necessary for Doe to raise the\nissue of discriminatory jury selection through an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim.\n\n    Doe is correct that this failure constituted deficient\nperformance. Additionally, though, Doe has the burden to\ndemonstrate prejudice by showing that there is a reasonable\nprobability that the claim J.B. failed to raise at trial would\nhave prevailed, either at trial or on appeal. Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 694. He cannot do so.\n\n    In order to prevail on a Batson claim, Doe would have\nneeded to make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor\nexercised his peremptory strikes on the basis of race. To show\nthat he could have done so, he relies on the statistically\ndisparate use of strikes, and on the fact that the prosecutor\nasked black – but not white – veniremembers whether their\nrace might influence their judgment. While the prosecutor’s\ndisparate use of strikes and selective questioning is troubling,\nin a recent and similar case, Carrera v.

Brady\n\n    Fourth, Doe argues that the prosecutor improperly\nwithheld impeachment evidence – namely, that the police\nworking on his case had interceded on behalf of M.H. in a\nwelfare fraud and perjury case. The extent of the intercession,\nif any, remains unclear; there is no evidence in the record of\nany deal, except for a notation in M.H.’s file by an\nunidentified person that she was “very important to [a] case.”\nWhether or not this constituted a violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963),12 however, Doe cannot\n\n\nWheeler’s ‘strong likelihood’ standard, rather than Batson’s ‘raise an\ninference’ standard, in determining whether Carrera would have been able\nto establish a prima facie case . . . .”).\n 11\n      We stated in Carrera, 699 F.3d at 1111:\n\n          It is true that the prosecutor asked Hispanic-surnamed\n          venirepersons whether the fact that the defendant was\n          “of Spanish descent” would affect their deliberations,\n          and that he did not ask potential white jurors similar\n          ethnicity-based questions. However, asking questions\n          about potential bias is the purpose of voir dire.\n 12\n    Certainly, failure to disclose an agreement to put in a good word for\nM.H. might have violated Brady.

Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n281–82 (1999). M.H.’s testimony simply described items\ntaken from the house during the murder-burglary, which the\nprosecution compared to the (nearly identical) list of items\nP.F. reported seeing in Doe’s possession. Especially given\nthat the jury already knew that M.H. had been charged with\nperjury, it is unlikely to have further discounted her testimony\nupon learning that she received some indefinite benefit for\nher cooperation. What’s more, Doe’s recorded statements,\ndiscussed previously, were strong enough evidence to support\na conviction even if the jury had some doubt about M.H.’s\ncredibility.\n\n                E. Evidence of Prior Crimes\n\n    Fifth, Doe asserts that the jury received extraneous\nevidence of prior crimes he committed, and that this\nprejudiced him. Specifically, he complains that during an\nhour-long mid-trial examination of exhibits, but not during its\neventual deliberations, the jury had access to unredacted\ntranscripts of Doe’s recorded conversation with P.F.\ncontaining references to a prior burglary and a prior assault.\nHowever, these references were extremely brief and buried in\na transcript containing much more compelling evidence of\nDoe’s guilt. Furthermore, the jurors were questioned about\ntheir review of the transcripts after the conclusion of the\npenalty phase, and none remembered reading anything about\nassaults or burglaries in the transcript. We agree with the\ndistrict court that this evidence, even if the jury did see it, was\nharmless.\n\n    Doe also challenges the trial judge’s decision to allow the\nprosecutor to impeach a character witness, D.P., Doe’s\ngirlfriend in California, by asking her whether she had heard\n\f18                      DOE V. AYERS\n\nthat he had been accused of rape in his home state and\nwhether this affected her opinion of him. (It did not.)\nImpeachment of character witnesses with questions about\nprior bad acts of the defendant, even if unproven, is common\npractice. See Fed. R. Evid. 405(a). Thus, this claim fails.\n\n                 F. Cumulative Prejudice\n\n    Sixth, and finally, Doe claims that these guilt-phase errors\nwere cumulatively prejudicial. Because Doe’s guilt-phase\nclaims do not call into question the veracity or admissibility\nof the most damning evidence of his guilt – his own recorded,\ninculpatory statements – we hold that, on the record before\nus, he cannot demonstrate prejudice with respect to his\nconviction.\n\n  IV. Penalty-Phase Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n     More important, for purposes of this opinion, Doe\ncontends that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for\nfailing to investigate, and present at the penalty phase of his\ntrial, certain mitigating evidence. That evidence relates to\nsexual abuse he suffered while previously incarcerated in a\nnotorious prison in the South, as well as to mental illness,\nneglect and abuse he suffered during his childhood, and\nsubstance abuse. To prevail on this claim, Doe must show\nboth that counsel was deficient and that he was prejudiced as\na result. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687–88.\n\n    Deficient performance requires a showing that “counsel’s\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness.” Id. at 688. Defense counsel is “strongly\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all\nsignificant decisions in the exercise of reasonable\n\f                        DOE V. AYERS                         19\n\nprofessional judgment.” Id. at 690. To rebut this presumption,\nDoe must show that J.B. did not act “reasonabl[y] considering\nall the circumstances.” Id. at 688.\n\n      “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s conduct\ncan satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances\nfaced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions\nregarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.” Id. at\n688–89. However, “[r]estatements of professional standards\n. . . can be useful as ‘guides’ to what reasonableness entails\n. . . to the extent they describe the professional norms\nprevailing when the representation took place.” Bobby v. Van\nHook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (2009). At the time of Doe’s trial in\n1987, the prevailing professional norms, as outlined by the\nABA Standards, required that a lawyer “conduct a prompt\ninvestigation of the circumstances of the case and [] explore\nall avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case\nand the penalty in the event of conviction,” and “called for\n[trial] counsel to cover several broad categories of mitigating\nevidence.” Id. at 7, 11 (citation omitted). The commentary to\nthe standards made clear that “information concerning the\ndefendant’s background, education, employment record,\nmental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the\nlike, will be relevant . . . .” Id. at 7–8.\n\n    “[D]eath is different[.]” Ring v.

So too are the lengths to which defense counsel\nmust go in investigating a capital case. “The imperative to\ncast a wide net for all relevant mitigating evidence is\nheightened at a capital sentencing hearing because the\nConstitution prohibits imposition of the death penalty without\nadequate consideration of factors which might evoke mercy.”\nFrierson, 463 F.3d at 989 (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “Although counsel’s duty to seek out\n\f20                      DOE V. AYERS\n\nevidence of mitigation is not limitless, the Supreme Court has\nrecognized that the failure to pursue avenues of readily\navailable information – such as school records, juvenile court\nand probation reports, and hospital records – may constitute\ndeficient performance.” Id.

Beard,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 381–83 (2005)).\n\n    Although defense counsel may choose to ignore\nmanifestly unfruitful lines of inquiry, a lawyer has not\nfulfilled his duties to his client if he ceases investigating\nbecause his client has not been forthcoming about his\nbackground or because counsel has acquired some relevant\ninformation. Rather, if what counsel knows or should know\nsuggests that further investigation might yield more\nmitigating evidence, counsel must conduct that investigation.\nSee Douglas v. Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780580\"><a href=\"/opinion/780580/fred-berre-douglas-v-jeanne-s-woodford-warden-of-rswl-california-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088–89 (9th Cir.\n2003). “The presence of certain elements in a capital\ndefendant’s background, such as a family history of\nalcoholism, abuse, and emotional problems, triggers a duty to\nconduct further inquiry before choosing to cease\ninvestigating.” Earp v.

Deficient Performance\n\n    We agree with the district court that counsel was\nineffective in failing to investigate and present mitigating\nevidence.\n\n                1. Review of Investigation\n\n    As a preliminary matter, J.B. was deficient in his\nacknowledged failure to consider even the evidence D.S.’s\nlimited investigation had turned up: he did not “listen[] to any\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              21\n\ntapes of [D.S.]’s interviews, nor did [he] read transcripts of\nany taped interviews.” J.B. did read a few summary\ninvestigation reports produced by D.S., but these included\nvirtually no material from the interviews conducted in Doe’s\nhome state. Even if D.S. had conducted an adequate\ninvestigation – which he did not – J.B. would not have\nlearned what D.S. had discovered.\n\n    Because J.B. failed to review and follow up on the\ninformation presented to him by his investigator, he missed\nclear indications, for example, that his client was repeatedly\nraped in prison. An ex-girlfriend, I.R., told D.S. that Doe was\n“fresh meat” upon his arrival in prison at the age of 17, and\nthat people in the community were well aware that fellow\nprisoners “got some” from him.13 J.B. also knew that Doe’s\nmother, C.G., had sought psychiatric help for her son after his\nrelease from prison. J.B.’s file contained a copy of a lengthy\narticle from the inmate newspaper at the notorious Southern\nprison where Doe was incarcerated, which described in\ngraphic detail the frequency and effects of prolonged sexual\nabuse.\n\n                         2. Prison Records\n\n    J.B. had a bit of Doe’s prison file – nine pages of criminal\nrecord, discharge papers, a rap sheet, and fingerprints. D.S.\n\n  13\n       The state suggests an inconsistency between the claim that many\npeople knew about Doe’s victimization, and the fact that most of those\ninterviewed by D.S. did not talk about it. (One other interview subject\nassumed that he was sexually abused and mentioned rumors to that effect.)\nIt is not very difficult to imagine, however, that members of a poor black\ncommunity in the South might not volunteer, unless asked directly,\nembarrassing information about a family member and friend to an\ninterloper from California.\n\f22                          DOE V. AYERS\n\ntold J.B. that to get the complete file, which would shed\nadditional light on Doe’s time in prison, J.B., as counsel,\nwould need to request it. J.B., however, did not follow up on\nthis most straightforward of leads, handed to him by his\ninvestigator: he did not request the records, and “do[es] not\nremember making any efforts to learn about [Doe]’s\nexperience [in prison].”\n\n    In addition, neither J.B. nor D.S. asked Doe whether he\nsuffered abuse while incarcerated. Although Doe told them\nabout being in prison, J.B. was “unaware of any allegation\nthat [Doe] had been [redacted in original] abused [in\nprison],”14 and “did not specifically inquire” about any\nabuse.“I believe I should have known it,” J.B. said.\n\n    J.B.’s failure to send off for Doe’s prison records – easy\nto obtain and very valuable – constituted deficient\nperformance.

Interviews with Doe\n\n    J.B. had only one interview with Doe himself, during\nwhich he barely asked any questions about his upbringing.\nJ.B. admitted that his interview with Doe was perfunctory: “I\n\n\n  14\n    D.S., on the other hand, admits that he “learned that [Doe] had been\nsubjected to some sort of physical and sexual abuse while he was\nincarcerated . . . .” Somehow, this vital piece of information was never\npassed along to J.B. nor pursued further by D.S.; “no further investigation\nwas made into issues relating to [Doe]’s incarceration . . . , including any\nissue relating to sexual victimization.”\n\f                         DOE V. AYERS                          23\n\ndo not recall whether I discussed with [Doe] the abuse from\nhis Uncle [J.C.], but if I did, it was on a superficial level.” He\nalso acknowledged that this failure affected his penalty-phase\npresentation, because “the testimony elicited at trial reflected\nthe extent of the abuse of which I was aware.”\n\n    D.S. also spent a few sessions interviewing Doe. While\nDoe did speak positively about some aspects of his childhood,\nand said that “he would call everyone [in his family] basically\nsane,” Doe did mention – without disclosing its full extent –\nthe physical abuse he suffered at the hands of his uncle. D.S.\nhimself expressed the suspicion that Doe “avoid[ed]” or\n“ignor[ed]” his problems. He expressly informed J.B. that his\ninterview of Doe was merely a preliminary inquiry into Doe’s\npersonal and family history, noting that this “information was\nprovided by [Doe] himself and is [in] no way meant to be a\ncomplete list of information available . . . .”\n\n    As a psychologist later retained by habeas counsel\nexplained, based on professional experience, there are often\nreasons why a person who has been chronically abused and\nneglected might well decline to disclose the details of\ndifficult and embarrassing personal history. That Doe did not\nvolunteer more about the trauma he experienced during his\nchildhood and in prison did not absolve J.B. of the need to\nconduct an adequate mitigation investigation, especially since\nDoe did identify (and D.S. recognized), if not in elaborate\ndetail, a number of avenues for further investigation that\nwould have proved fruitful.\n\n    The district court was correct in concluding that the\ndeficiencies it found in J.B.’s penalty-phase performance\nwere not excused by the alleged failure of Doe (and his\nfamily) to be completely forthcoming. “[Doe] never put any\n\f24                          DOE V. AYERS\n\nlimits on [the] penalty phase investigation,” J.B.\nacknowledged. Nor did he make false statements to J.B. or\nD.S. or obstruct their investigation. Doe simply did what most\ncapital defendants – and most people – do, and did not\nvolunteer deeply painful, shameful information when not\npressed for details. Trial counsel has an affirmative duty not\nto simply accept the facts as they might be presented at first\nblush, but rather to “unearth[] for consideration” at the\nsentencing phase “all relevant mitigation information.”\nWallace v.

Had J.B. asked them more than\nadmittedly cursory questions, he would have learned what the\nexperts retained by habeas counsel did.16 Had he gone further\n\n\n     16\n         By and large, the evidence later discovered through more\ncomprehensive interviews was consistent with – and far more detailed\nthan – the history provided initially. The one discrepancy relates to the\nyears during which Doe was under the care of his mother, versus that of\nhis grandmother and uncle. Doe’s mother suggested that he was in her\ncustody for more of his early childhood than was actually the case, though\nD.S. was also told that Doe had been removed from his mother’s care and\nraised by his grandmother and uncle. This disparity should have prompted\nfurther inquiry, but D.S. never asked Doe’s mother for clarification. “[If\nhe had done so,] counsel would have become skeptical of the impression\ngiven by [some of Doe’s] family members and would unquestionably have\ngone further to build a mitigation case. Further effort would presumably\nhave unearthed much of the material postconviction counsel found [with\nrespect to childhood abuse and neglect].” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 391.\nWhen she was asked the question directly, during post-conviction\nproceedings, Doe’s mother testified that her children lived primarily with\ntheir grandmother. Doe’s grandmother and aunt confirmed that his mother\nabandoned Doe at a young age.\n\n     It is not surprising that experts with mitigation training, charged with\nconducting a mitigation investigation, were better able to elicit useful\ninformation about deeply personal, shameful trauma and dysfunction than\nwere a lawyer and investigator who did not follow up on obvious, critical\n\f                          DOE V.

But I wasn’t comfortable being me\njust getting out and walking in there by myself so I decided\nnot to go in.” He spoke on the phone with Doe’s mother (and\npossibly others) while he was there, but did not conduct any\nin-person interviews. At no point during his representation of\nDoe, J.B. reported, did he speak with anyone other than those\nhe called to testify at the penalty phase.\n\n    When D.S. went to Doe’s home state, he, at least, got out\nof his car. However, he repeatedly failed to ask obvious\nquestions, including follow-up questions when interviewees\nrevealed potentially significant information. He did not ask\nrelatives and friends who had known Doe during his\nchildhood about his upbringing or behavioral signs of mental\nillness. When the mother of one of Doe’s girlfriends (both\nmother and daughter were named V.M.) said she felt he was\n“like a second son,” and that he called to speak with her after\n\n\nleads, and a psychological expert asked only to investigate guilt-phase\nmental-state defenses who was deprived of the background material she\nrequired (and requested) to do even that job adequately.\n\f28                      DOE V.

When\nanother interviewee, M.W., who had known Doe as he was\ngrowing up, described him as a “loner,” D.S. did not ask any\nfollow-up questions about his mental health. Although Doe’s\nstepfather, B.G., had also served time in the same prison, D.S.\ndid not ask him about abuse Doe might have suffered in\nprison. When a friend, J.A., reported that Doe told him over\nthe phone that the prison was a “bad place,” D.S. did not ask\nwhether Doe had said anything further. Other interviewees\nalso mentioned that Doe was different after his release, or that\nthey had spoken to him while he was incarcerated, but D.S.\nnever asked them if they knew about any trauma Doe might\nhave suffered in prison. As J.B. acknowledged, the important\nquestions about Doe’s life were simply never asked.\n\n    D.S. appears to have met only once with each\ninterviewee, and many of the meetings were arranged by\nDoe’s mother at her home. Obviously, interviewees are less\nlikely to be forthcoming about sensitive topics in the presence\nof family members and friends. See Correll v.

Psychological Experts\n\n     J.B. did retain a psychologist, Dr. M.R., to interview Doe.\nShe had the professional expertise necessary to discover and\npresent the compelling mitigating testimony regarding Doe’s\nmental health that went unheard at trial, but she was limited\nby the terms of her engagement. J.B. hired her, she reported,\nonly to determine whether any mental state defenses based on\n“obvious signs of mental impairment” could be mounted at\nthe guilt phase of the trial. Dr. M.R. reported that she “was\nnot asked to do more,” and that she “was not asked to provide\nexpert assistance in preparing or presenting a mitigation case\nat the penalty trial.”17\n\n     In addition to having a limited scope, the investigation\nthat Dr. M.R. conducted was abbreviated. She was paid only\nfor twelve and a half hours of her time and met with Doe only\nonce, for an hour-long session largely devoted to filling out\na questionnaire and discussing his criminal record. In her\n\n\n  17\n     The state contends that Dr. M.R. was in fact retained for the purpose\nof developing a mitigation case at the penalty phase. When asked whether\nhe actually told her to conduct a penalty-phase investigation, J.B. testified:\n“I don’t recall exactly what I told her. But I did tell her that it was a capital\ncase and that I was looking into all issues with regard to [Doe].” J.B. may\nhave told Dr. M.R. that he was looking into “all issues,” but he did not tell\nher to look into “all issues.” No one else was looking into Doe’s mental\nhealth, either; J.B. did not recall having investigated, or having asked D.S.\nto investigate, whether Doe had ever received psychological treatment.\n\f30                            DOE V.

The only background\nmaterials he provided her were police reports.18 When she left\na message saying that she had “no documents on\nbackground,” he did not bother to return her call.19\n\n  18\n     Dr. M.R. noted this deficiency in her report, stating: “If . . . there is\nfurther information that the defense counsel wishes to bring to my\nattention in order to evaluate [Doe] further, I shall be happy to do so.”\nContrary to the state’s contention, Dr. M.R. made clear that the life history\nshe considered was “provided” by Doe himself during their interview, not\nby D.S.\n     19\n        Providing psychological experts with the background material\nnecessary for them to competently and correctly evaluate defendants is\ncritical, and when such information is requested by an expert, as here, the\nfailure to provide it constitutes deficient performance. When no\nbackground information is made available, experts may conclude that\nfurther investigation will not be fruitful, just as Dr. M.R. did here.

J.B.’s failure to retain a\npsychological expert for the penalty phase was objectively\nunreasonable, given that he had sufficient notice of Doe’s\nmental health problems. He knew – or would have known, if\nhe had reviewed the interviews that D.S. conducted – that\nDoe’s mother brought him to a hospital for psychiatric help.\nD.S. stated in his assessment of Doe, which J.B. does appear\nto have read, that “he will not acknowledge that he has a\npsychiatric problem.” Doe’s mental illness was recognized by\nJ.B.’s investigator, who was not a mental health expert.\nHowever, even this recognition was not enough to motivate\nJ.B. to order a mitigation-related psychiatric examination of\nhis client.\n\n    The state’s assertion that Dr. M.R. addressed the issue of\nmitigating evidence in her report is incorrect.

Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708222\"><a href=\"/opinion/708222/95-cal-daily-op-serv-8886-95-daily-journal-dar-15404-edgar-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1995), is directly on point. In Frierson, we\nexplained:\n\n          Because the evidence presented at each phase\n          of a trial serves a markedly different purpose,\n          we analyze the reasonableness of counsel’s\n          efforts to prepare for trial and sentencing\n          differently. As we explained in Wallace v.\n          Stewart: “Hendricks alludes to why the\n          lawyer’s burden might differ at the guilt phase\n          from that at the penalty phase: Mental state is\n          relevant at the guilt phase for issues such as\n          competence to stand trial and legal insanity –\n          technical questions where a defendant must\n          show a specific and very substantial level of\n          mental impairment. Most defendants don’t\n          have problems this severe, and counsel can’t\n          be expected to know that further investigation\n          is necessary to develop these issues. By\n          contrast, all potentially mitigating evidence is\n          relevant at the sentencing phase of a death\n          case, so a troubled childhood and mental\n          problems may help even if they don’t rise to\n          a specific, technically-defined level.”\n\n\n 20\n      Emphasis added.\n\f                      DOE V. AYERS                       33\n\n       Thus in Hendricks, we held that it was\n       reasonable for counsel to rely on his experts’\n       findings that no diminished capacity defense\n       was available at the guilt phase, and to\n       terminate his perfunctory investigation of his\n       client’s known mental impairments.\n\n       Our determination in Hendricks that counsel’s\n       investigatory work was reasonable, however,\n       did not extend into the penalty phase. Because\n       a sentencing jury is given “broad latitude to\n       consider amorphous human factors, in effect,\n       to weigh the worth of one’s life against his\n       culpability,” we have recognized that the\n       presentation of relevant mitigation evidence is\n       of vital importance to the jury’s penalty\n       determination. Accordingly, we concluded\n       that “counsel’s failure to investigate his\n       client’s mental condition as a mitigating\n       factor in a penalty phase hearing, without a\n       supporting strategic reason, constitute[d]\n       deficient performance.” We therefore held\n       that because evidence of Hendrick’s\n       “nightmarish upbringing” and “mental\n       problems” could have altered the jury’s\n       decision to impose a death verdict, counsel\n       was constitutionally ineffective.\n\n463 F.3d at 993 (citations omitted).

Substance Abuse\n\n    D.S.’s investigation did not reveal the extent of Doe’s\nsubstance abuse, but it did reveal enough to warrant expert\nfollow-up. Doe acknowledged that he drank alcohol\nexcessively, that he became aggressive when he was drunk,\nand that he had used both marijuana and cocaine. Other\ninterviewees noted that he had problems with alcohol and that\nthe robbery he committed was alcohol-related.\n\n    Most important, D.S. concluded that although “[Doe]\nfeels that he has no drinking problem, . . . [i]t appears to this\ninvestigator that alcohol is a direct cause for [Doe]’s violence\nas he described his past life to me.” He went on to say that\n“[Doe] does not necessarily like to admit that he may have\ncertain problems in particular areas . . .

Penalty-Phase Witnesses\n\n    In addition, Doe claims, J.B. did nothing to prepare his\npenalty-phase witnesses. J.B. does not dispute this: “I did not\nprepare any of the penalty phase witnesses for their\ntestimony. I did not tell them what specific questions I was\ngoing to ask them nor did we discuss the responses I expected\nfrom them.”21 Although this failure, on its own, might have\nbeen insufficient to establish deficient performance, it serves\nhere to reinforce other evidence of J.B.’s woefully\nincompetent mitigation investigation and presentation.22\n\n    The witnesses who did end up testifying were family and\nfriends attending the trial. Some of them were not told that\nthey would be testifying until they arrived.23\n\n\n 21\n      When asked how he chose which witnesses to call, he could not recall.\n 22\n    Notably, these witnesses could have spoken to much of the mitigating\nevidence later presented during Doe’s habeas hearing, except for the\ndetails of his prison experience (but including the psychological\nramifications of it).\n  23\n     J.B. never informed two witnesses that he would be calling them as\nwitnesses. He spoke to Doe’s aunt before she testified, but did not tell her\nwhat he planned to ask her, and merely instructed her to “plead for\n[Doe]’s life.” J.B. spoke with Doe’s ex-girlfriend, D.P., prior to her\ntestimony, but just briefly, “to get to know her,” and not about what he\nwould ask or what she would say.\n\f36                         DOE V. AYERS\n\n    J.B. did little better with the two penalty-phase witnesses\nhe “spent a lot of time with[,]”24 Doe’s mother and aunt. He\nacknowledged in his declaration that his failure to prepare\nthem to testify was related to his failure to discover the\npowerful mitigating evidence about which they could have\nspoken. He said: “[M]y relationship with them was quite\nsuperficial, and I got very little useful or accurate information\nfrom them about [Doe]’s life before his arrest for this\noffense.” J.B. also acknowledged that he “spoke with them\nonly generally about the penalty phase [and] did not go over\nwith them the particular questions they would be asked.” He\nexplained that Doe’s “mother and aunt seemed like such nice,\nsweet ladies that I never got beyond consoling them about\n[Doe]’s plight so as to get to really understand his life.”\n\n    The state’s argument that J.B.’s failure to prepare penalty-\nphase witnesses was an acceptable trial strategy is erroneous.\nEven if it were an intentional decision on his part – which is\nboth doubtful and disturbing – spur-of-the-moment mitigation\npresentations form no part of constitutionally adequate\nrepresentation.

Conclusion\n\n    The investigation here was facially inadequate. J.B. fell\nfar short of his “sacrosanct duty to conduct a full and\ncomplete mitigation investigation.” Earp, 431 F.3d at 1175.\nThis conclusion is only strengthened by the fact that the\nlimited investigation J.B. and D.S. did conduct put them on\nnotice that further investigation was warranted. Unfortunately\nfor Doe, they failed to perform it. We have repeatedly held,\nas has the Supreme Court, that this constitutes deficient\nperformance. See Lambright v.

Strategic Judgment\n\n     There is a “wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance[,]” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, but J.B.’s\nperformance was not within its outer bounds. Unlike most\ntrial lawyers called to testify before a habeas court, J.B. never\nattempted to justify his actions as based in strategy; he\nadmitted that he would have presented the extensive\nmitigating evidence habeas counsel discovered, had he found\nit himself. J.B. acknowledged that he did not make a strategic\ndecision not to put on the sort of mitigating evidence later\nadduced; he simply didn’t know about it. “Looking back on\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                              39\n\nthe penalty phase of [Doe]’s trial, it’s hard for me to say what\nmy strategy was,” he said.26\n\n    Strickland tells us that “strategic choices made after less\nthan complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the\nextent that reasonable professional judgments support the\nlimitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a\nduty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\nreasonable decision that makes particular investigations\nunnecessary.” 466 U.S. at 690–91. In conducting this\nanalysis, we “must indulge a strong presumption that\ncounsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance.”27 Id. at 689.\n\n   Here, J.B.’s “failure to investigate thoroughly resulted\nfrom inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment.” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 526. “[D]efense counsel failed to make a\n\n  26\n    J.B. stated that by putting on a few witnesses who knew, loved, and\nfound value in Doe, thereby humanizing him, he “did not intend to\nexclude or foreclose the presentation of other types of mitigating\nevidence.” Surely a penalty-phase presentation is not insulated from\nreview merely because it is not entirely devoid of value, due to a few\nquestions to a few witnesses that foreseeably elicited snippets of\nmitigation testimony. Notably, the evidence Doe argues that J.B. should\nhave discovered and introduced was in no way inconsistent with the paltry\nevidence already presented.\n   27\n      Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct 1388 (2011), altered rather than\nclarified the analysis we apply in evaluating deficient performance of\ncounsel going forward. This is because AEDPA requires, and Pinholster\napplies, not only Strickland’s presumption of attorney competence but also\nan additional layer of deference. As Chief Judge Kozinski put it,\n“Strickland’s presumption of competence and AEDPA deference each\nrequire us to presume that the lawyers did the smart thing, not the dumb\none.” Pinholster v.

An\nuninformed strategy is not a reasoned strategy. It is, in fact,\nno strategy at all.” Correll, 539 F.3d at 949.\n\n    The presumption that defense counsel’s conduct falls\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance is\ninapposite, or at least firmly rebutted, when, as here, we know\nfor sure that defense counsel had no strategy, because he has\nunequivocally said as much. Representing a capital defendant\nwithout a strategy is per se unreasonable, and necessarily\nconstitutes deficient performance.\n\n      Generally, we credit the statements of defense counsel as\nto whether their decisions at trial were – or were not – based\non strategic judgments.28 In Heishman v.

He\ninstructed that in the course of a prejudice analysis, we should credit trial\ncounsel’s statements about whether undiscovered evidence would have\nbeen introduced at trial. See id. at 553–54 (“It is irrelevant whether a\nhypothetical ‘reasonable attorney’ might have introduced evidence of\nalleged sexual abuse; [defense counsel] would not have done so, and\ntherefore [the defendant] was not prejudiced by their allegedly inadequate\ninvestigation.”).

Prejudice\n\n    Although the district court found that J.B. had performed\nincompetently, it concluded that his deficient performance\nhad not prejudiced Doe. That conclusion is erroneous.\n\n    To establish prejudice, Doe must show “a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “A reasonable probability is a\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.” Id. “That requires a ‘substantial,’ not just a\n‘conceivable,’ likelihood of a different result.” Pinholster,\n131 S.

We therefore “reweigh the evidence in\naggravation against the totality of available mitigating\nevidence.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534.31 Because death\nsentences in California must be imposed by a unanimous jury,\nwe must find prejudice if there is a “reasonable probability\nthat at least one juror would have” voted for life. Id. at 537;\nCal. Penal Code § 190.4(b). We hold that there is a\nsubstantial probability that there would have been a different\nresult at the penalty phase had counsel’s performance during\nthat phase of the trial not been ineffective.\n\n             A. Aggravating Evidence at Trial\n\n    The aggravating evidence the jury considered was, for a\ncapital case, fairly minimal. Instead of any additional\nevidence about the murder for which Doe had just been\nconvicted, beyond what was presented during the guilt phase\nof the trial, a stipulation was read to the jury that said in its\nentirety that a doctor, if called to testify, would state that “the\nvictim in this case [L.R.] at the time of her death had a mild\nhemiparesis of the brain as a result of congenital cerebral\npalsy which entailed a varying but never totally disabling of\nher impairment in motor coordination and muscular\ndevelopment on her left side only.”\n\n   31\n      As above, we conduct this analysis without affording the extra\ndeference to state court decisions required by Pinholster. There, the\nSupreme Court explained that pre-AEDPA case law offered no guidance\nas to post-AEDPA assessments of prejudice, because AEDPA requires\ndoubly deferential review. For the same reason, post-AEDPA cases offer\nus little guidance here. We apply only the deference required by\nStrickland, and no second layer of deference.\n\f44                          DOE V. AYERS\n\n    The remainder of the aggravating evidence consisted\nsolely of testimony about two incidents:\n\n    First, the prosecution called one of two women who were\nwalking together in a park in Doe’s home state when Doe\nrobbed them at gunpoint. The jury learned that Doe, then a\njuvenile, had grabbed the woman’s arm, pointed a gun at her,\nand demanded both of their purses. He fled immediately after\nacquiring them, leaving the women uninjured. A certified\ncopy of Doe’s conviction, showing that he had served five\nyears in prison for this crime, was also introduced.\n\n     Second, the jury heard testimony about another incident,\nin which Doe was arrested on suspicion of residential\nburglary. (No conviction resulted.) Doe – who was homeless\nat the time – broke into an apartment after its residents left for\nwork and got into bed. When he was found there, by a police\nofficer, he was under the covers, wearing a sweatshirt and\nsweatpants but no socks or shoes. He initially gave a false last\nname and said that he had spent the previous night with his\ngirlfriend, who, he said, lived in the apartment. After he was\narrested, Doe was allowed to retrieve some of his clothing,\nwhich he had hung in the closet. At the police station, Doe\nadmitted that he had entered through the window, but said\nthat he had touched nothing and only wanted to sleep. In fact,\nit appeared that he had riffled through the kitchen, and moved\nthe TV and VCR away from the wall (a screwdriver was\nfound nearby). A long knife was found on the floor of the\nbathroom;32 he had neglected to flush the toilet.\n\n\n\n 32\n    The two police officers called to testify also mentioned that when they\narrived at the apartment, they encountered a man – not Doe – holding a\ncrowbar and guarding the door.

AYERS                               45\n\n    This penalty-phase aggravating evidence is a far cry from\nthat which the Supreme Court deemed “extensive” in\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1408. There, the state presented\nevidence that the defendant had “threatened to kill the State’s\nlead witness, assaulted a man with a straight razor, and\nkidnapped another person with a knife.” Id. There was also\nevidence that he “had a history of violent outbursts, including\nstriking and threatening a bailiff after a court proceeding at\nage 17, breaking his wife’s jaw, resisting arrest by faking\nseizures, and assaulting and spitting on police officers.” Id.\nMoreover, the jury in Pinholster heard about the defendant’s\n\n         involvement in juvenile gangs and his\n         substantial disciplinary record in both county\n         and state jails, where he had threatened,\n         assaulted, and thrown urine at guards, []\n         fought with other inmates . . .

He testified that he had reconnected with\nhis son because when his mother fell ill, she asked to see Doe\nbefore she died. Doe lived with him briefly, but then went to\nlive with J.A.’s niece. J.A. also explained that his new wife\nhad expressed concern that Doe’s presence in their home\nmight lead him to get in contact with Doe’s mother. Doe’s\nfather did not know that Doe had been in prison in his home\nstate.\n\n    The fifth witness, Doe’s aunt, had known him for\ndecades, but was asked – and testified – only about events\nthat occurred after his arrival in California. She stated that he\nhad lived with her, and that she had helped him find\ntemporary work. She testified further that her husband “blew\nup” at him over a disagreement and kicked him out of the\nhouse, but that Doe had remained calm while her husband\nthreatened violence. She acknowledged that she had “pretty\nstrong feelings, love towards [Doe],” and said that she would\n“stand behind him” if he was allowed to live.\n\f50                            DOE V.

Mitigating Evidence Not Introduced at Trial\n\n    The powerful evidence introduced in the habeas\nproceedings at the district court, by contrast, represented the\nfruits of an appropriate mitigation investigation.

Rape in Prison\n\n    The most compelling mitigating evidence that J.B. failed\nto discover was also the easiest to obtain. There was reliable\nevidence, in documents that J.B.’s investigator specifically\ninstructed him to request and in testimony from a prison\nguard and multiple prisoners,39 that Doe – then a 17-year-old\n\n\n\n 39\n    The state argues that the evidence from which defense counsel could\nhave established that Doe was repeatedly raped in prison would not have\nbeen credible. This is not the case. The fact that Doe was repeatedly and\nviolently assaulted by other prisoners is very well corroborated, through\nthe combination of his prison records, his own statements as reported by\ntwo psychological experts, the declarations of some family members and\nfriends, the declarations of a number of fellow prisoners, and the\nconfirmatory declarations of two prison experts with knowledge of the\nprison. The evidence is detailed and consistent. At the hearing in the\ndistrict court, counsel for the state was apparently so unconcerned with\nrefuting the testimony of those prisoners that he accepted the submission\nof their declarations and waived the right to cross-examine them.\n\n     P.P., a warden at the prison just before Doe’s term of incarceration,\nconcluded based on his review Doe’s prison record that it was “extremely\nlikely that petitioner [Doe] was repeatedly subjected to forced sexual\ncontact by other inmates during his incarceration . . . .”\n\n    Another expert, D.B.F., an associate professor of criminal justice, had\nserved as an expert on jails and prisons in state and federal courts in Doe’s\n\f                            DOE V.

Doe\nhimself, when asked directly about his experience by trained\nmental health professionals equipped with his records and\ncharged with the task of discovering information relevant to\nthe penalty phase, disclosed his abuse in vividly painful\ndetail. However, evidence concerning Doe’s chilling, brutal\nexperience in prison was completely absent from the penalty\nphase of the trial. Had J.B. conducted an adequate\ninvestigation, he would have discovered this information and\ncould have presented it, along with psychological expert\ntestimony explaining its impact, to the jury.\n\n    Dr. J.C. reported, based on her review of Doe’s prison\nrecord and the interviews she conducted with Doe and others,\nthat he experienced “a series of violent physical and sexual\n\n\n\nhome state. D.B.F. described the notorious prison in which Doe was\nincarcerated:\n\n         The strong ruled, and the weak either served or\n         perished. Sexual abuse and homosexual slavery were\n         widespread, with inmates auctioned, sold and traded\n         like cattle by other inmates. . . . Many young inmates –\n         black and white – who came to [the prison] in the 1970s\n         to serve short terms for less serious felonies ended up\n         with much longer sentences, including natural life\n         terms, for trying to escape or fighting back, sometimes\n         to the death, against rape and exploitation.\n\nThe rampant sexual violence in this prison was also acknowledged by\nanother former warden in his memoir. (Citation omitted.)\n\n     Even if jurors were inclined to doubt the truthfulness of prisoners’\ntestimony, they would presumably credit that of a warden and a professor.\n\f54                          DOE V.

E.P.\nfound, during his review of Doe’s prison records, “a report by\na guard stating that he saw [Doe] lying on the seat of a\ngarbage truck face down with his jump suit pulled down\nbelow his knees and inmate [R.S.] lying on [Doe] with his\npenis in [Doe]’s rectum.”42\n\n\n\n  40\n     It is unclear how many times Doe was raped. E.P. noted that Doe told\nhim he had been raped three times, but that other sources reported many\nmore. “It is common for male victims of prison rape to under-report the\nnumber of times they have been raped,” he explained, “because of the\nshame and trauma associated with prison rape.” E.P. believed that Doe\nhad been raped more than three times.\n\n     Additionally, Dr. J.C. received a report from a close friend of Doe’s\nthat he was raped in the jail where he was held prior to being transferred\nto prison. Doe also revealed that he suffered violence at the hands of\nguards, including gassing and starvation, which he described as a\n“nightmare.” His aunt also reported hearing from a cousin of Doe’s, N.M.,\nthat guards had beaten and kicked Doe until his clothes came off and he\nurinated and defecated on himself. However, because these incidents are\nnot corroborated elsewhere in the record, we have not weighed them in\nmitigation.\n  41\n     Youth is one of the primary risk factors for sexual victimization in\nprison.

[R.S.] was a much bigger man than [Doe].\n\n     The fact that guards did not observe – or at least did not report – the\nother occasions when Doe was raped is hardly surprising, given that the\ndorms in this prison were not staffed at night. One prisoner, D.S.,\nexplained that “the dorms were wild and out of control at night. Young\ninmates were regularly raped, inmates were routinely killed. No one was\nsafe. . . . The guards just didn’t care what went on out of their sight.”\nAnother prisoner, A.S., said that “the mentality of the guards was to let it\nall happen and ignore the inmates getting hurt as a means of keeping\ncontrol.”\n\n    In the same year this case began, another circuit denounced “the\ninability or unwillingness of some prison administrators to take the\nnecessary steps to protect their prisoners from sexual and physical assaults\nby other inmates” as “a national disgrace.” Martin v.

Dr. J.C. stated:\n\n         [Doe]’s traumatic experiences [in prison] may have\n         been even more painful to him due to the knowledge\n         that at least some of the assaults may have been\n         arranged by his mother’s husband. Family members\n         report that [B.G.], [Doe]’s mother’s husband at the time\n         [Doe] entered [prison], had it in for [Doe] and set it up\n         so that [Doe] would be raped.\n\nDoe’s aunt heard from her nephew, N.M., that this was true. Two\nprisoners independently stated as much. One said:\n\n         [R.R.] saw to it that [Doe] was taken to the gym and set\n         up. At the gym, [Doe] was forced to go into a room\n         with various guys who forced him to have sex with\n         them. . . . After that [Doe] tried to keep on running. The\n         problem was that [R.R.] had too many friends in the\n         main prison. Even though [Doe] kept moving from\n         camp to camp, he was never safe.\n  45\n    In fact, Doe did hurt himself. Dr. J.C. discovered, upon review of\nDoe’s prison records, that they “document [Doe]’s attempts to harm\nhimself by mutilating his right forearm and wrists.” She noted that in her\nexpert opinion, “[t]his suicidal gesture is not surprising given that [Doe]’s\nlong-standing depression had been complicated by feelings of betrayal,\nshame, and rage, along with ongoing anxiety regarding continued future\nassaults.”\n\f58                           DOE V. AYERS\n\n    On another occasion, Doe told E.P., he was “raped in a\nfull dormitory, in front of all the other inmates there at the\ntime.”46 A different time, Doe\n\n         was walking on the grounds when he was\n         grabbed and pulled to the ground with a knife\n         to the throat [and raped]. [Doe] says about this\n         experience, “I had come too far to die up in\n         this place here,” which of course was his\n         primary concern. . . . When he was released\n         [Doe] was “just glad to get out of there\n         walking.”\n\n    Powerful prisoners apparently controlled Doe no matter\nwhere he moved in prison. E.B., a prisoner who knew Doe,\nsaid:\n\n         The older inmates got [Doe] when he first\n         came to [prison]. . . . An older inmate put a\n         claim on [Doe]as his own. [Doe] was moved\n         to . . . a camp here, . . . for protection. . . .\n         [Doe] could have tried to get away from [B.]\n         and from being forced to have sex with other\n         inmates by moving from one camp to another,\n         but [Doe] never would have been able to\n         really get away. Once [Doe] was owned by\n\n\n  46\n      Doe told E.P. that he had “blocked . . . out” the memory of this\nparticular rape until he was released. E.P. explained that this “dissociative\nevent,” a “symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,” “indicates the\nrelative severity of this particular rape, which was much more public and\ntherefore more shameful than the prior rape. The public nature of it would\nalso represent greater danger since that kind of branding in the prison\nculture can lead to many more rape attempts.”\n\f                           DOE V.

And that inmate\n         wouldn’t just be forced to have sex with the\n         one inmate, he would be forced into\n         prostitution for the benefit of the inmate who\n         owned him – often for just a carton of\n         cigarettes. . . . The inmate who owned him\n         would send word to the new cell or dorm that\n         [Doe] belonged to him. Someone in the new\n         setting would be charged with taking care of\n         [Doe] for the first inmate, and it would all\n         start again. [Doe] would have had no way to\n         escape the life he was forced into. He would\n         have been utterly trapped.47\n\n    Dr. J.C. observed that Doe, in his efforts to escape harm,\nchanged his custody or work assignment 73 times in less than\nfive years. Many of his requests to be transferred to\nadministrative lockdown were made in the early hours of the\nmorning; as other prisoners corroborated, assaults often\noccurred at night. (Again, this striking evidence, like the\nevidence of Doe’s self-harming, was available in the prison\n\n\n  47\n     Cf. LaMarca v.

He\nsuggested that “[i]n order to have any measure of safety during the\nparticular years [Doe] was here, he would have had to become partners\nwith another inmate for protection.”\n\f                             DOE V.

And\nthat really hurt me . . . . And when you told me that, I just felt\nlike you didn’t have any more respect for me as being a\nman.”\n\n    This evidence is powerful. As another prisoner, A.R.,\nstated in his declaration, “Prison rape is the most devastating\nthing you can experience.”50 Undoubtedly, this evidence\n\n\n   49\n      The (widely corroborated) fact that many of Doe’s friends and\nrelatives knew about the rape makes even more obvious how utterly\ninadequate J.B.’s mitigation investigation was.

We are convinced that if\nthe jury had heard about what had happened to Doe in “that\nman-made hell,” this evidence alone would have stirred\nsufficient compassion or understanding in the jury to result in\na life sentence.\n\n                       2. Mental Illness\n\n    The psychological impacts of Doe’s experience in prison\nwere obvious to those who knew him. His ex-girlfriend, I.R.,\nsaid: “I think he was a crazy man. But he wasn’t like that in\nthe beginning [before prison].” A cousin, N.M., said his time\nin prison had “caused [Doe] to go crazy.” Doe was “slipping\nin the head.” A neighbor and friend, A.S., said:\n\n        [Doe] seemed like a troubled young man to\n        me. He was not really all there. . . . It didn’t\n        take a psychiatrist to see there was something\n        eating at [Doe]. . . . [Doe] told me he had\n        problems . . . . I believe in my heart that what\n        happened to [Doe] [in prison] wrecked his\n        mind. The system didn’t help him, it just\n        broke him. Those experiences of being raped\n        are stuck in [Doe]’s head. He would never\n        talk about it and let any of those feelings out.\n\nAnother friend, J.A., put it thus: “He was like people who\ncome back from Vietnam and could never talk about their\ntime there.”52\n\n   52\n      Doe’s mother and aunt also said that he did not talk about his\nexperiences in prison.\n\f64                             DOE V. AYERS\n\n     Behaviorally, Doe was off. “A lot of things he said didn’t\nmake sense” to J.A. He was “extremely jumpy,” “nervous,”\nand “jittery.” He “couldn’t keep still,” “wasn’t sleeping,”\n“would walk around the house all night long,” and was\n“easily upset and agitated.” Sometimes he “would just sit and\nnot speak,” even when spoken to. I.R., who had known him\nall his life and with whom he was romantically involved after\nhis release, believed that he “needed some psychiatric\ncounseling after being confined for five whole years” and that\nperhaps he became “angry over flashbacks.” She said, as Dr.\nJ.C. noted, that “he could go out of control when he was\nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs and it seemed . . . that\n[Doe] has a split personality – that he seemed to be\nschizophrenic. [Doe] could be warm and loving one minute,\nthen the next minute ‘tripped out.’”53\n\n    The impacts of Doe’s trauma did not recede with time. A\nyear and a half after his release, his mother arranged for him\nto see a mental health specialist; the intake sheet noted that\nshe “[r]eport[ed] [Doe] was in [] prison for 6 years and [his\nmother] feels it has done something to him – he’s nervous,\nnot violent . . . .” During intake, he said he was suffering from\n“nerves,” “inappropriate laughter,” “depression/blues,”\n\n\n 53\n      A friend, A.S., reported that after his release,\n\n           [Doe] was very tense and would quickly become\n           agitated and upset over minor irritations. To me it\n           seemed that [Doe] had great difficulty dealing with any\n           pressure or stress. I saw [Doe] fly into a serious rage\n           two or three times. . . . [Doe] never seemed able to\n           control his anger or emotions, much as he wanted to\n           and tried. . . . I would describe [Doe] as schizo, just two\n           completely different people in the same body. Anger\n           would just spew out of [Doe] at times.\n\f                        DOE V.

Doe told\nDr. J.C. that he remembered not caring about anything and\nwanting only to be isolated. It was recommended that he\nattend weekly psychotherapy sessions and Alcoholics\nAnonymous; it seems that he did not.\n\n    After Doe was taken into custody for his current offense,\nhe wrote in a letter to I.R. that the abuse he suffered in prison\n“play[ed] a part in the destruction of my life. But I thought I\nwas handl[ing] it good, until I got out of that hell hole, I was\nso immature, with man’s body, but a young and very\nconfused mind.” He went on to explain that he\n\n        need[ed] someone so bad after all that shit I\n        went through in that man-made hell, but there\n        wasn’t anyone to turn to. I couldn’t turn to\n        you not by you fully respecting me as\n        something happen[ed] to me that you [or] no\n        one would understand. . . .

She explained:\n\n        A man who is raped experiences powerful\n        feelings of shame, guilt, and rage; yet, a man\n        who must remain in an environment of\n        continued sexual assault is forced to\n        internalize these feelings in order to play the\n        role that is intended for him and survive the\n\f66                          DOE V.

Research suggests that the\n         combination of physical and sexual assault\n         with little recourse to justice, humiliation by\n         both attacker and by others in the prison, and\n         the requirement for continued submission to\n         sexual demands constitutes formidable\n         pressure resulting in severe psychological\n         reactions. These feelings and reactions would\n         have been compounded for [Doe] by his\n         history of being physically dominated by his\n         stronger, more powerful Uncle [J.C.]\n         throughout his childhood and adolescence and\n         by the severe neglect he experienced as an\n         infant at the hands of his mother.\n\n    Dr. J.C. explained that prison left him ravaged by\nsignificant mental illness: “Upon discharge, he was a broken\nman. He suffered from symptoms consistent with Post-\ntraumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD],54 Major Depression,55 and,\n\n\n\n  54\n     The district court mischaracterized Doe’s serious mental illness as\n“extremely mild mental problems.” PTSD is a “grave affliction.” United\nStates v.

The victimization [Doe] suffered\n          [in prison], coupled with his traumatic childhood and\n          adolescence, and lack of guidance or modeling in\n          healthy relationships, led to his inability to manage\n          intense negative emotions and his tendency to act out\n          physically in the way he had been taught to act\n          throughout his childhood.\n\nShe also noted that Doe’s substance abuse would “exacerbate [his]\ninability to suppress or control violent behavior.” E.P. gave a similar\nexplanation.\n 55\n      She explained that depression was often a result of trauma:\n\n          Ways of avoiding thoughts, feelings, and sensations\n          associated with trauma can include avoiding\n          conversations, shutting down emotionally or feeling\n          emotionally numb, trouble having loving feelings or\n          feeling any strong emotions, feeling strange or\n          disconnected from the world, feeling weird physical\n          sensations and losing interest in the things one used to\n          enjoy.\n\nShe elaborated:\n\n          People who have experienced trauma often have\n          problems in relationships with others because they have\n          a hard time feeling close to people or trusting them.\n          This is especially likely to happen when the trauma was\n          caused or worsened by people known to the victim (as\n          opposed to an accident or natural disaster).\n\f68                           DOE V. AYERS\n\nin a continued attempt to self-medicate against the pain and\nescape from the daily horror of his memories, quickly\nredeveloped a Poly-substance Dependence.”56 She noted that\nhe “experienced all but one (combat exposure) of the\ntraumatic events most often associated with PTSD in men”:\nchildhood neglect, childhood physical abuse, and rape.57 In\ndiagnosing Doe with Major Depression, Dr. J.C. observed\nthat his depression began in his childhood but was\nexacerbated by his experience in prison.58\n\n\nThis did occur for Doe, as evidenced by the fact that he refused to speak\nabout what happened to him in prison with his aunt, with whom he was\nvery close.\n  56\n      The habeas court also considered the report of a California prison\npsychiatrist who found “evidence of organic brain dysfunction.” The\ndistrict court dismissed this evidence, stating, without support, that “[a]\ndysfunction is less than a disorder, disease, or defect.” However, because\nDoe does not rely on this solitary piece of evidence in his briefing before\nus, and because it is superfluous to our conclusion, we do not consider it\nfurther.\n      57\n       This diagnosis is hardly surprising. See National Prison Rape\nElimination Commission Report 14 (June 2009) (“The psychological\naftereffects of sexual abuse are well documented. They include\nposttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, fear of loud noises or\nsudden movements, panic attacks, and intense flashbacks to the traumatic\nevent. Each of these consequences alone has the ability to re-traumatize\nvictims for years.”); id. at 45 (“The closed nature of correctional facilities\ncan lead to especially devastating effects for sexual abuse victims. . . .

The\nconsequences of sexual abuse may be worse for those who are young,\nhave a past history of sexual abuse, or have a preexisting mental illness.”).\n 58\n   It seems that Doe had a history of depression prior to his incarceration.\nE.P. reported that when Doe’s mother was married to B.G., he became\n“withdrawn, isolated and very depressed, and lost 85 pounds.” Dr. J.C.\n\f                           DOE V. AYERS                              69\n\n    Doe establishes prejudice based on the foregoing\nevidence alone. There is more than a “reasonable probability\nthat, [considering this evidence], the sentencer [i.e., at least\none member of the jury] . . . would have concluded that the\nbalance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not\nwarrant death.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. His experience\nof brutalization as a youngster in prison and resulting mental\nillness are even more powerfully mitigating, however, when\nviewed alongside evidence of his abusive childhood and\nsubstance abuse. Hence, we turn now to those subjects.\n\n               3. Childhood Abuse and Neglect\n\n    As for Doe’s childhood, J.B. did elicit penalty-phase\ntestimony that his father did not support his mother, that his\ngrandmother cared for him while his mother was working,\nthat his uncle abused him physically,59 and that he had\nemotional problems when his mother remarried. This picture\nof Doe’s childhood, however, seriously understated the\nviolence he suffered at the hands of his mother and his uncle,\nand afforded little in the way of mitigation that might be\npersuasive to a jury.\n\n\n\n\nconcluded that Doe had suffered another major depressive episode upon\nhis release from prison, which only worsened after he moved to\nCalifornia.\n   59\n       J.B. did not, however, elicit the painful details. Penalty-phase\ntestimony about Doe’s childhood came only from his mother; she\nmentioned, only briefly, that his uncle would “whip” Doe, and that he\nstarted to beat Doe when he was eleven or twelve. The violence inflicted\non Doe as a child was characterized by J.B., in questioning Doe’s mother,\nas “discipline.”\n\f70                      DOE V. AYERS\n\n    Dr. J.C., who conducted interviews designed to elicit\nevidence of childhood abuse and neglect, learned much more.\nShe reported that Doe’s mother, herself a victim of physical\nand sexual abuse and an abuser of alcohol and drugs, was\n“virtually absent” from his life until he was six years old.\nWhen he was an infant, she abandoned him, sometimes\novernight, to go out drinking. On such occasions, she would\nleave him wrapped in a fur coat, without food or clean clothes\nor diapers. Sometimes, his diapers were not changed for days,\nand became so filthy they were black. Neighbors saw him\ncrawling down the hallway of his apartment, begging for\nsomething to eat. Not only was Doe’s mother neglectful; she\nbeat him with a belt or extension cord.\n\n     In Dr. J.C.’s words, Doe’s “early childhood was in many\nways a continuation of his experience in infancy,” and his\n“transition from childhood to adolescence was filled with\ncontinued neglect by his mother and the other adults in his\nlife.” The testimony the jury heard did not make known that\nDoe was, in fact, raised largely by his violent uncle and\ngrandmother (who once aimed a gun at him) after the age of\none, because his mother was unable to take care of him.\n\n    Doe’s uncle singled him out, repeatedly beating him\nthroughout his childhood years, unpredictably and for no\nreason, with his fists and with sticks, sometimes on the head.\nHe punched Doe in the head if he came home slightly late or\ndid something perceived to be disrespectful. He once knocked\nDoe off a ladder, and kicked him in the head as he lay on the\nground until he lost consciousness. On another occasion, he\npounded Doe’s head into a telephone pole. Another time, he\ntried to run Doe over with a car. Even after Doe was released\nfrom prison, his uncle still beat him, once with a large shovel.\n\f                          DOE V. AYERS                             71\n\nDoe wrote in a letter that he was “lucky the man didn’t kill\nme . . . .”\n\n    This evidence, too, would have been powerful. “It is well\nestablished that early childhood trauma, even if it is not\nconsciously remembered, may have catastrophic and\npermanent effects on those who . . . survive it.’” Stankewitz,\n698 F.3d at 1169 (citation omitted).\n\n                      4. Substance Abuse\n\n    J.B. also did not present evidence of Doe’s serious\nsubstance abuse at the penalty phase of his trial. While this\nfailure alone would not have prejudiced Doe, the evidence\nwould have helped to sway the jury towards life when\nconsidered cumulatively, alongside the other mitigating\nevidence.60 Here, as Dr. J.C. explained, mitigation based on\nDoe’s substance abuse would not simply have been additive.\nRather, the evidence of his escalating dependence would have\namplified the mitigating force of Doe’s repeated trauma in\nprison, which drove him to “continued attempt[s] to self-\nmedicate against the pain and escape from the daily horror of\nhis memories.” Cf. Ainsworth, 268 F.3d at 876 (concluding\nthat failure to present evidence of substance abuse at the\npenalty phase was prejudicial, and noting expert testimony\nthat the petitioner “used drugs as a form of self-medication\nbecause he lacked any other means of overcoming or even\ncoping with his unbearable inner experience”).\n\n\n\n\n  60\n    There is also evidence that substance abuse was pervasive in Doe’s\nimmediate and extended family, and that he was exposed to alcohol and\ndrugs at a young age.\n\f72                           DOE V. AYERS\n\n    A.S., who lived for many years in the same neighborhood\nas Doe’s family and met him after his release from prison,\nreported that “most nights I saw [Doe] drink between seven\nand nine half-pints of hard liquor [and, when he was able to\npour his own drinks,] even more.” He added that “he just kept\ndrinking more and more . . . which usually made him more\nirrational and easily upset. By the time [Doe] left for\nCalifornia, his drinking problem was enormous and he\nseemed extremely unstable.”61\n\n    Doe told E.P. that “after his release from prison he felt\nprofoundly depressed and anxious, which he tried to\novercome by drinking alcohol to keep numb.” E.P. explained,\nas an expert witness could have at trial, that “[t]he resort to\n\n\n 61\n    Exactly which drugs he used and when is less clear. Doe told D.S. that\nhe smoked marijuana occasionally – which contributed to his leaving\nschool – and did two grams of cocaine per weekend after his release from\nprison. D.S. noted that while Doe was twice supposed to attend substance\nabuse treatment programs, he never did so. E.P. reviewed a statement by\na classmate of Doe’s, who said that Doe regularly used alcohol, marijuana,\nand prescription pills, and that he saw Doe snort suede cleaner. Dr. J.C.\nwas informed that Doe consumed a variety of other, harder drugs. Though\nthe list Dr. J.C. reported is longer, Dr. M.R. learned from Doe, before his\ntrial, that he had used marijuana, barbituates, tranquilizers, and cocaine.\n\n     The state argues that the statements of some witnesses as to Doe’s\nsubstance abuse are unreliable and perhaps exaggerated. However, the\nevidence of Doe’s substance abuse would have been useful to the jury not\nto explain an intoxicated state that precipitated the crime, as in Mayfield\nv. Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775490\"><a href=\"/opinion/775490/demetrie-ladon-mayfield-v-jeanne-woodford-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2001), the case the district court and\nstate both cite, but rather to help the jurors understand that Doe had\nunsuccessfully attempted to self-medicate. Cf. id. at 931 n.17 (“[J]uries are\nunlikely to favor defenses based on abuse of dangerous drugs in\nevaluating a defendant’s culpability for violent behavior.” (emphasis\nadded)). Hence, the precise details of his substance abuse are not critical\nto the prejudice inquiry.\n\f                            DOE V. AYERS                                73\n\ndrugs and alcohol as a means of coping with pain is common\namong people who are depressed and among people who\nhave experienced significant trauma.” He observed that Doe\n“retreated into a continual drug and alcohol haze that helped\nhim to turn off the recurring traumatic thoughts. Trauma is\noften most effectively treated through a combination of\npsychological counseling and psychotropic medications, none\nof which were available to [Doe].”\n\n    Evidence about Doe’s childhood would have\ndemonstrated to the jury that the trauma he suffered in prison\nwas not isolated, but rather the most disturbing of multiple\nepisodes in a horrific series that stretched back to his birth.\nEvidence about his substance abuse would have highlighted\nhis inability to cope with his violation in prison. We have\nconcluded that the evidence of Doe’s repeated rape in prison\nand its detrimental effects on his mental health is sufficient to\nestablish prejudice; this additional mitigating evidence, which\nJ.B. likewise failed to present, only strengthens that\nconclusion.62\n\n\n\n\n   62\n      Like materiality in the Brady context, prejudice resulting from\nineffective assistance of counsel must be “considered collectively, not\nitem by item.” Kyles v.

This is particularly true when, as here, the different pieces of\nmitigating evidence fit together into an internally coherent and compelling\nnarrative whole. As E.P. put it, after assessing Doe, “The trauma inflicted\non [Doe] [in prison] built upon the trauma from his childhood – the\nparental neglect, the beatings by [Doe’s] Uncle [J.C.], the depression, the\nsubstance abuse. [Doe] entered [prison] a depressed, traumatized,\naddictive young man and left as a severely more compromised\nindividual.”\n\f74                           DOE V. AYERS\n\n                 D. Comparison to Other Cases\n\n    The determination whether a petitioner was prejudiced by\nhis lawyer’s failure to discover and present mitigating\nevidence is an inherently fact-intensive inquiry, and requires\nclose consideration of individual records, rather than\noversimplified, ordinal comparisons between summaries of\nthe suffering experienced by capital defendants. Such\njudgments are “uniquely moral decision[s] in which bright\nline rules have a limited place.” Hendricks, 70 F.3d at 1044.\n\n    That said, our finding of prejudice to Doe is indeed\nsupported by just such a comparison; we have found\nprejudice in other similar cases. See Douglas, 316 F.3d at\n1088–90 (mitigation not presented at trial included evidence\nthat the defendant was raised by an alcoholic foster father\nwho locked him in a closet, had to scavenge for food, was\nbeaten and gang-raped by other prisoners when he was a\nteenager, was decorated in the Marines, suffered a head\ninjury, and consumed a lot of alcohol); see also Karis v.\nCalderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776960\"><a href=\"/opinion/776960/james-leslie-karis-v-arthur-calderon-warden-james-leslie-karis-v-arthur/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1137–41 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(mitigation not presented at trial included evidence that the\n\n\n     Had J.B. conducted an adequate mitigation investigation, he would,\nby his own admission, have presented a very different story: one of\nsignificant childhood abuse and neglect, compounded by the trauma of\nrepeated sexual victimization and subjugation beginning at the age of 17,\nand leading to significant mental health problems and efforts to self-\nmedicate.

Although Doe’s\nlife was, of course, different than Wiggins’s and Rompilla’s,\nhe, too, clearly “has the kind of troubled history we have\ndeclared relevant to assessing a defendant’s moral\nculpability.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535.\n\n         VI. Causal Nexus and Rebuttal Evidence\n\n    The state offers two additional arguments against our\nconclusion that J.B.’s deficient penalty-phase performance\nprejudiced Doe.\n\n    First, it argues that J.B.’s failure to introduce evidence of\nthe abuse Doe suffered – both as a child and in prison –\ncannot have prejudiced him because this evidence could not\n\n 64\n     Rompilla also had organic brain damage. Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 392.\nHowever, there is no indication that this was a determinative factor in the\nSupreme Court’s analysis, or even – buried as it is in a list of other\nunintroduced mitigating evidence – that it was more significant than any\nof the rest of it. To assume otherwise would be to assume, contrary to the\nSupreme Court’s express statements, that penalty-phase mitigating\nevidence will carry weight only when it offers a causative explanation for\nthe offense.\n\f                         DOE V. AYERS                          77\n\nhave explained why he committed the offense. This argument\nfails both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. The\ndeclarations of the two psychological experts retained by\nhabeas counsel would have offered jurors a way to\nunderstand (though of course not to justify) Doe’s aggression\nas the product of repeated brutalization that left him suffering\nfrom PTSD. Additionally, both we and the Supreme Court\nhave recognized that while demonstrating such a causative\n“nexus” between painful life experiences and the commission\nof the offense is one way in which mitigating evidence can be\nexpected to alter a sentencing outcome, it is certainly not the\nonly one.

The second goes instead\nto the first prong of the ineffective assistance analysis: the deficiency of\nJ.B.’s performance. The state suggests that had he known about both the\nmitigating evidence and the rebuttal evidence it might draw, he would\nhave chosen to put on only the same limited mitigation presentation he\noffered at trial.

The form\n\f80                       DOE V. AYERS\n\nattributes these assaults to the group as a whole, and includes\nno statements about particular incidents nor about any\nspecific acts of Doe’s. This is the only allegation of such\nbehavior in his voluminous prison file, and is substantiated by\nno other evidence. The state’s brief refers to it, tellingly, as an\n“indication.” The third piece of evidence is the mention in a\nprobation report that during Doe’s detention in a California\njail prior to his murder trial, another prisoner asked to be\nmoved, alleging that Doe propositioned him for sex and\nthreatened to initiate sex without consent. There is no\nsuggestion that anything further occurred, and his “[i]nmate\nrecords reflect no disciplinary action was taken on this\ninstance.”\n\n    Though these latter two pieces of evidence are perhaps\nmore likely to have been admissible on relevance grounds, as\nthey concern sexual abuse Doe allegedly perpetrated while\nconfined, their unreliability might well have barred their\nintroduction. See People v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625366\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625366/people-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762 (Cal.\n2003). Even if this evidence was properly admissible, the jury\nwould likely have given it little weight, given that neither of\nthe reports was detailed or supported by any additional\nevidence, Doe’s role in the first incident was very unclear,\nand the second report did not even allege an actual assault.\n\n    Furthermore, it is well known that sexual abuse can beget\nsexual abuse. Suggestions that Doe became sexually\naggressive after being raped would actually have supported,\nnot contradicted, the testimony of Dr. J.C. and E.P. about the\neffect of the trauma Doe suffered on his behavior, and the\nevidence in multiple declarations about the power structure in\nprison that he was forced to learn, in order to survive. Both\nexperts reported that people who are raped in prison often act\nout sexually; the fact that such prisoners often attempt to\n\f                              DOE V.

The added value of a meaningful mitigation\npresentation would, in Doe’s case, have far outweighed the\n\n\n\n  66\n      Robert W.

Conclusion\n\n    Doe received profoundly deficient assistance of counsel\nduring the penalty phase of his trial: while very strong\nmitigating evidence existed, it was never uncovered by J.B.,\nand the resulting presentation was so anemic as to be virtually\nwithout value. These failures were due, defense counsel\nreadily admits, not to any sort of strategic judgment but rather\nto incompetence.\n\n    In some cases, we have found that although defense\ncounsel’s investigation was inadequate, the evidence he\nwould have discovered would have been, though extensive,\nlargely duplicative. See, e.g., Miles, 713 F.3d at 492–93\n(“Petitioner’s additional social history is, as the district court\n\n\n  69\n     Cf. Wong v.

Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789013\"><a href=\"/opinion/789013/clarence-ray-allen-v-jeanne-s-woodford-warden-of-the-california-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984–85 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(holding that unintroduced mitigating evidence of questionable value and\noffered by easily impeached witnesses was insufficient to outweigh “the\nextraordinarily damaging aggravating evidence . . . that [the defendant]\nhad just been convicted by his death-qualified jury of orchestrating – from\njail – a conspiracy to murder seven people, and succeeding in the actual\nkilling of three, all to retaliate for their prior testimony against him and to\nprevent future damaging testimony . . . .”).\n\f                           DOE V. AYERS                              83\n\nnoted, largely cumulative of what was already before the\nsentencing judge in the [pre-sentence report], meaning that its\nmitigating value would be marginal.”). However, the jury that\nsentenced Doe was utterly unaware of his brutalization in\nprison and resulting mental illness, as well as the abuse and\nneglect he suffered during childhood. This unintroduced\nevidence, far from being duplicative, would have radically\naltered the mitigation presentation at trial.\n\n    In Doe’s case, the evidence procured and introduced by\nhabeas counsel “adds up to a mitigation case that bears no\nrelation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before\nthe jury.”70 Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393. “[A]lthough we\nsuppose it is [hypothetically] possible that a jury could have\nheard it all and still have decided on the death penalty, that is\nnot the test.” Id. The jury at Doe’s trial was presented with\nrelatively weak evidence in aggravation, and little evidence\nin mitigation, and chose death. Had J.B. conducted an\nadequate investigation, the jury would have heard, instead, an\nextremely compelling mitigation presentation (and little if\nany additional evidence in aggravation). “[T]he discrepancy\n\n  70\n     This is indeed how the prosecutor characterized J.B.’s mitigation\npresentation at closing argument:\n\n         I don’t think you are going to hear any strong argument\n         from the defense that you have heard evidence that\n         mitigates the murder of [L.R.]. I don’t think you are\n         going to be able to find that you have heard anything,\n         any factors in mitigation that can outweigh the factors\n         in aggravation. I think what you are going to hear is a\n         plea for mercy.\n\n     J.B. did not dispute it: “Ladies and gentlemen, [the prosecutor] is\nright. I am going to plead for to you [sic] choose life. I am going plead\n[sic]. I do plead for you to choose life.”\n\f84                       DOE V. AYERS\n\nbetween what counsel did investigate and present and what\ncounsel could have investigated and presented” was massive.\nStankewitz, 365 F.3d at 716. It is far more likely than not that\nthe jury would have been swayed, resulting in a failure to\nimpose a sentence of death. Especially given that AEDPA\ndoes not apply to this case, it is not a close one. Doe was\nprejudiced by J.B.’s failure to investigate and present\nmitigating evidence.\n\n    Upon learning of the evidence he failed to discover in\nrepresenting Doe – his first capital client – J.B., to his credit,\nacknowledged as much:\n\n        [M]y investigation and my representation of\n        [Doe] at the penalty phase of his trial were\n        inadequate. I believe that a compelling\n        argument could and should have been made to\n        a jury on his behalf that his life should not be\n        taken by the State of California. It appears\n        that his family’s multi-generational history of\n        abuse and neglect had continued, and it was\n        inflicted upon [Doe] virtually from the time of\n        his conception and continued through\n        childhood and into adolescence. When he was\n        sent . . . [to prison] he was [a] teenager, but he\n        was placed with the worst of the worst of that\n        state and suffered literally unspeakable abuse.\n        If his jury had heard that evidence they might\n        well have chosen to spare his life.\n\n“[T]he mitigating evidence was there,” he concluded – and it\nwas “compelling” – “but the jury never got to hear it.”\n\n                            * * *\n\f                        DOE V. AYERS                         85\n\n    The judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and\nreversed in part. We remand with instructions to grant the\nwrit with respect to the penalty phase and return the case to\nthe state court to reduce Doe’s sentence to life without parole,\nunless the State of California elects to pursue a new capital\nsentencing proceeding within a reasonable amount of time as\ndetermined by the district court.\n\n  AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and\nREMANDED.\n\n   Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\f</pre>",
