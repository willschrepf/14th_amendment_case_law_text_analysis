HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n      The EPA accused Louisiana Generating (“LaGen”) of violating the Clean\nAir Act. In an ensuing consent decree, LaGen promised to upgrade part of its\npower plant, surrender emissions allowances, and fund various environmental\nprojects. LaGen asked its insurer, Illinois Union (“ILU”), to pay the costs of\nthese measures, arguing that they qualified as “remediation costs” under\nLaGen’s policy. ILU refused. The district court entered summary judgment for\nLaGen, finding that the policy bound ILU to pay LaGen’s costs in full. We\nVACATE and REMAND.\n\fCase: 15-30914   Document: 00513624218      Page: 2   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                            No. 15-30914\n                                   I\n We summarized the early history of this dispute in a prior opinion:\n        [This case concerns] Big Cajun II (“BCII”), a coal-fired\n electric steam generating plant owned by LaGen in Louisiana. In\n February 2005 and December 2006 the EPA sent LaGen Notices of\n Violation (“NOVs”) alleging that certain major modifications\n performed without a permit at BCII in 1998 and 1999 caused net\n emissions increases in violation of the [Clean Air Act]. In January\n 2009, NRG Energy, LaGen’s parent, purchased a Custom Premises\n Pollution Liability Insurance Policy (“the [P]olicy”) from ILU to\n cover a large number of its facilities, including BCII. The effective\n date of the [P]olicy is January 22, 2009.\n       On February 18, 2009, the EPA filed . . . suit over the\n modifications made to BCII, asserting violations of the [Clean Air\n Act] and Louisiana environmental laws. . . . The suit allege[d] that\n the previous owner of BCII did work on the plant that increased\n certain emissions which under applicable law would be considered\n “major modifications” and would have required a Prevention of\n Significant Deterioration of Air Quality permit (“PSD permit”)\n before being completed. The suit also allege[d] that the plant\n modifications failed to employ best available control technology\n (“BACT”) to limit emissions, as required by the CAA and Louisiana\n law. The complaints allege[d] that since acquiring BCII, LaGen\n ha[d] continued to operate the plant without seeking a PSD permit\n for the modifications. As a result, the complaints assert[ed], BCII\n ha[d] emitted excess amounts of regulated pollutants into the air.\n ...\n        LaGen sought coverage from ILU under the [P]olicy for legal\n fees associated with the underlying EPA suit, and ILU denied that\n the EPA suit was covered by the [P]olicy. LaGen filed suit in\n Louisiana federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that ILU\n ha[d] a duty to defend and indemnify LaGen in the EPA suit. The\n district court bifurcated the trial between the duty to defend and\n the duty to indemnify. . . . In a January 30, 2012 order, the district\n court granted summary judgment for LaGen with regard to the\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218          Page: 3     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30914\n       duty to defend and denied the motion for summary judgment filed\n       by ILU. 1\n       On ILU’s motion, the district court certified its January 30 order for\ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). We accepted the appeal and\naffirmed, finding that the relief the EPA sought, including civil penalties, the\nsurrender of LaGen’s emission allowances, and “other appropriate actions to\nremedy, mitigate, and offset the harm to public health and the environment\ncaused by the [alleged] violations,” potentially fell within the [P]olicy’s\ncoverage for “‘claims, remediation costs, and associated legal defense expenses\n. . . as a result of a pollution condition’ at a covered location.” 2 Because New\nYork law, which governs the Policy, gave insurers an “exceedingly broad” duty\nto defend, enforceable “whenever the allegations of the complaint suggest . . .\na reasonable possibility of coverage,” ILU had a duty to defend LaGen against\nthe EPA’s allegations. 3\n\n\n\n1 Louisiana Generating L.L.C. v. Illinois Union Ins. Co., 719 F.3d 328, 331-32 (5th Cir. 2013)\n(footnote omitted).\n2 Id. at 332-34.\n3 Id. at 333-34 (quoting BP Air Conditioning Corp. v. One Beacon Ins. Grp., 871 N.E.2d 1128,\n\n1131 (N.Y. 2007)). LaGen broadly alleges that in this appeal, ILU “ignores key [prior] rulings\nfrom this court concerning the meaning of the pollution policy” and “fails to recognize the\nimport” of the earlier decision. But LaGen does not appear to argue that we previously\nresolved any of the specific issues now in dispute.\n         The district court, for its part, seemed to suggest that our earlier decision held that\n“remediation” should be understood as synonymous with the dictionary definitions of “abate”\nand “mitigate.” If this was the district court’s view, it was mistaken. In fact, we stated only\nthat under the Policy, “‘[r]emediation costs’ are defined very broadly to include expenses\nincurred to redress pollution in compliance with environmental law, including, inter alia,\ncosts associated with investigating, mitigating or abating pollution. This language . . .\npotentially covers the multiple prayers for relief in the EPA complaint which seek to require\nLaGen to mitigate, offset and remediate the alleged past pollution.” Louisiana Generating,\n719 F.3d at 335. As this excerpt makes clear, we did not explain the meaning of “mitigate” or\n“abate” in our earlier decision, nor did we hold that the costs of the measures the EPA sought\nwere “remediation costs.” Nor did we need to: in the prior appeal, our task was to determine\nwhether the Consent Decree Measures (which had not yet been finalized) “potentially” were\nremediation costs, and in turn, whether there was a “reasonable possibility” that the Policy’s\nterms encompassed them. Id. at 335 (emphasis added).\n                                               3\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218         Page: 4    Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\n       Around the same time, the EPA and LaGen settled the underlying\ndispute and negotiated a consent decree. In relevant part, the decree required\nLaGen to (1) install selective non-catalytic reduction (“SNCR”) technology\nupgrades at Unit 3 of BCII, a part of the plant not alleged to have been out of\ncompliance in the EPA’s suit; (2) surrender certain emissions allowances; 4 and\n(3) pay for a variety of “environmental mitigation projects.” 5\n       LaGen sought indemnification from ILU for the costs of these measures\n(hereinafter the “Consent Decree Measures”), asserting that they were\n“remediation costs” under the Policy. ILU refused. Both parties then moved in\nthe ongoing district court action for summary judgment on the indemnification\nissue. In the alternative, ILU moved to postpone summary judgment\nproceedings to allow further discovery.\n       The district court granted summary judgment for LaGen. First, the court\nfound that the Policy’s “remediation costs” language encompassed projects that\ngenerally offset pollution or moderated its effects, rather than only projects\nthat physically removed or contained pollution. Second, it found that each of\nthe Consent Decree Measures would “remediate” pollution in this way,\nobligating ILU to pay for them. Third, it found that the costs LaGen incurred\nto complete the Consent Decree Measures were reasonable, entitling the\ncompany to coverage in full. The court also denied ILU’s request for a\ncontinuance and further discovery, stating that ILU “failed to satisfactorily\nexplain its position to the Court.”\n       ILU appealed.\n\n\n\n\n4 An emissions allowance confers the right to emit a certain amount of pollution.\n5  These included electric vehicle infrastructure improvements throughout southern\nLouisiana; restoration of national parks, United States Forest Service lands, and a nearby\nlake; solar panel installation “at local schools, government-owned facilities, or facilities\nowned by nonprofit groups”; energy efficiency upgrades; and other projects yet to be defined.\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218          Page: 5     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n\n                                              II\n       “This court reviews the district court’s grant of summary judgment de\nnovo, applying the same legal standards as the district court.” 6 “The court shall\ngrant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” 7 “The court must view the facts developed below in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.” 8\n       New York law governs the Policy. 9 As the Second Circuit explained in\nanother insurance coverage dispute:\n       Under New York law “the initial interpretation of a contract is a\n       matter of law for the court to decide.” Included in this initial\n       interpretation is the threshold question of whether the terms of\n       the contract are ambiguous. An ambiguity exists where the terms\n       of a contract could suggest “more than one meaning when viewed\n       objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined\n       the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is\n       cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as\n       generally understood in the particular trade or business.”\n       Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of contract terms can arise\n       either from the language itself or from inferences that can be\n       drawn from this language. Hence, “only where the language and\n       the inferences to be drawn from it are unambiguous” may a district\n       court “construe a contract as a matter of law and grant summary\n       judgment accordingly.”\n             If the court finds that the contract is not ambiguous it should\n       assign the plain and ordinary meaning to each term and interpret\n       the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence. If the court finds\n\n\n6 Louisiana Generating L.L.C. v. Illinois Union Ins. Co., 719 F.3d 328, 333 (5th Cir. 2013)\n(citation omitted).\n7 FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).\n8 Saenz v. Harlingen Med.

ILU’s argument is in three parts. First, ILU claims that\nindirect mitigation efforts are not “remediation.” Second, ILU claims that even\nif they are, the Consent Decree Measures do not actually mitigate past\npollution as the Policy requires. Third, ILU claims that LaGen’s expenses are\npartially unreasonable. We address each argument in turn.\n       ILU first and most broadly contends that projects, like the Consent\nDecree Measures, that may indirectly reduce past pollution and its effects do\nnot fall under the Policy’s “remediation costs” provision. The Policy covers\n“‘remediation costs’ . . . as a result of a ‘pollution condition’ on, at, under, or\nbeyond the boundaries and that migrated from the ‘covered location(s).’” 12 It\ndefines “remediation costs” to include “reasonable expenses incurred to\ninvestigate, quantify, monitor, mitigate, abate, remove, dispose, treat,\n\n\n10 Alexander & Alexander Servs., Inc. v.

FMC Corp., 170 F.3d 518, 534 (5th Cir. 1999).\n12 The single quotation marks denote terms specially defined by the Policy. BCII is\n\nundisputedly a “covered location.”\n                                              6\n\f     Case: 15-30914     Document: 00513624218        Page: 7    Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 15-30914\nneutralize, or immobilize ‘pollution conditions’ to the extent required by\n‘environmental law.’” ILU argues that this definition cannot possibly\nencompass the costs for which LaGen seeks indemnification. According to ILU,\na reasonable interpreter familiar with the customs and usages of modern-day\nbusiness practice would understand “remediation,” in the air pollution context,\nto connote only “physically remov[ing], contain[ing], or treat[ing] contaminants\nalready in the air or address[ing] harms they caused to land, water, structures,\nanimals, or persons.”\n       Because the Consent Decree Measures cannot and do not accomplish\nthis, ILU insists, they are not remediation measures, and LaGen’s expenses in\ncarrying them out are not “remediation costs” under the Policy. 13 ILU\nacknowledges that some of the words the Policy uses in defining “remediation\ncosts,” chiefly “mitigate” and “abate,” appear to suggest a broader notion of\nremediation, but argues that those words are better understood to denote\ndirect, physical remediation, and must in any event be “read in a manner\nconsistent with the ‘remediation costs’ they define, not to stretch the concept\nof ‘remediation’ beyond its logical limits.” Even assuming, then, that the\nConsent Decree Measures indirectly offset the harm of BCII’s past pollution,\nthey are still not “remedial” in nature, and their costs are not “remediation\ncosts.” 14\n       The district court rejected ILU’s argument. It interpreted New York law\nto reject “the maxim that ‘environmental law terms’ should be treated as ‘terms\nof art,’ [and] instead demonstrate[] that ambiguous terms are interpreted\nagainst insurers and in a manner that a reasonable businessperson would\n\n\n\n13 The parties appear to agree that BCII’s past emissions cannot be “remediated” by any\nmeans (including the Consent Decree Measures) under ILU’s definition of the term.\n14 As discussed below, ILU does not concede that the measures actually offset the harm of\n\nBCII’s past pollution, whether directly or indirectly.\n                                           7\n\f     Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 8      Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30914\nexpect.” Accordingly, the court opined, “‘mitigate’ and ‘abate’ are to be given a\nconstruction congruent with their plain meaning and the expectations of a\nreasonable insured.” The court concluded that these terms’ “plain meaning”\nincluded their “traditional[]” dictionary definitions, and applied those broad\ndefinitions in determining whether the Consent Decree Measures qualified as\n“remediation” under the Policy. 15\n       In our view, this was error – at least at the summary judgment stage.\nUnder New York law, courts can and often must look beyond the dictionary\nand other such general-purpose sources in reading contracts: when a term in a\ncontract has a special, widely understood meaning in the business context in\nwhich the contract was executed, that meaning bears on the proper\ninterpretation of the term. 16 The court below gestured toward this principle in\nmentioning the “reasonable businessperson’s” expectation. But fully applying\nthe principle leads to a more equivocal result than that court reached.\n       On one hand, there is considerable evidence that in environmental law\nand related business practice, the term “remediation” is primarily used to refer\nto the physical, geographically focused containment and removal of pollutants\nand the damage they have caused, not to measures that indirectly reduce their\neffect in the broader environment. 17 In particular, “remediation” is associated\n\n\n15 Specifically, the district court wrote that “the definition of “mitigate” traditionally includes\nthe notion of becoming “‘less severe’” or “‘less harsh or hostile.’” Similarly, “abate” is often\ndefined using language such as “‘reduce in degree’” or “‘moderate.’” . . . [T]he Court will use\nthe plain meaning of “mitigate” and “abate” to determine whether either party is entitled to\nsummary judgment.” The court was quoting a LaGen memorandum that in turn quoted the\nMerriam-Webster dictionary.\n16 See, e.g., Morgan Stanley Grp.

See, e.g.,\nAlexander & Alexander Servs., Inc. v. These Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London,\nEngland, 136 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 1998); see generally Antilles S.S. Co. v. Members of Am.\nHull Ins. Syndicate, 733 F.2d 195, 203 (2d Cir. 1984) (Newman, J., concurring) (discussing\nthe fuzzy line between legal and factual determinations in contract interpretation). However,\nNew York law appears to contemplate that courts will consider industry usage as part of their\nthreshold, legal determinations of whether contractual terms are ambiguous. See Alexander\n& Alexander Servs., 136 F.3d at 86 (whether ambiguity is present turns in part on “customs,\npractices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or\nbusiness” (quoting Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898, 906 (2d Cir. 1997))).\n18 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 9601-9675 (2012).\n                                               9\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218           Page: 10     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30914\n“mitigate” and “abate” (among others). LaGen correctly notes that these terms\nare routinely used to refer to indirect, non-physical remedial efforts, both in\ncommon speech and in industries subject to environmental regulation. 19\n       But even though the Policy uses these broad words to define\n“remediation costs,” New York law suggests that the usual, narrower meaning\nof that term is still relevant. In Belt Painting Corp. v. TIG Insurance Co., the\nNew York Court of Appeals considered an insurance policy that excluded\ncoverage for harms caused by “pollutants,” which the policy defined to include\n“any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant including . . .\nfumes.” The court found that “reasonable minds [could] disagree as to whether\nthe exclusion” barred coverage for claims of injury due to indoor exposure to\npaint fumes, and accordingly rejected the insurer’s claim that the contract was\nunambiguous on this point. It reasoned that the insurer’s literal, broad reading\nof the policy’s definition of “pollutants” would “infinitely enlarge the scope of\nthe term ‘pollutants,’ and seemingly contradict both a ‘common speech’\nunderstanding of the relevant terms and the reasonable expectations of a\nbusinessperson.” 20 Belt Painting indicates that in New York, when a contract’s\nspecific, facially expansive definition of a term is in tension with the term’s\nusual meaning, the former does not control as a matter of law; rather, the\ntension may indicate ambiguity. 21\n\n\n19 See, e.g., supra note 15; U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, Office of Civ. Enforcement, Securing\nMitigation in Injunctive Relief in Certain Civil Enforcement Settlements (2nd Edition), (Nov.\n14,      2012),    at     2-3,     https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-10/documents\n/2ndeditionsecuringmitigationmemo.pdf; see also infra notes 43-44 and accompanying text.\n20 795 N.E.2d 15, 20 (N.Y. 2003); see also Harris v.

See\nBelt Painting, 795 N.E.2d at 17 (“[P]olicy exclusions are given a strict and narrow\nconstruction, with any ambiguity resolved against the insurer.”). Nonetheless, Belt Painting\nis still instructive in this case. In parsing the exclusion clause’s definition of “pollutant” and\n                                               10\n\f    Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 11     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30914\n       LaGen’s other arguments have force, but ultimately do not dispel the\nprospect of ambiguity. LaGen notes that ILU’s focus on “CERCLA-type”\ncleanups is unmoored from the actual text of the Policy. Indeed, the Policy\nstates that remediation costs include those required by “environmental law,”\nwhich it defines very broadly; 22 in contrast, other parts of the Policy specifically\ninvoke CERCLA. If ILU meant to limit “remediation” to the CERCLA context,\nthe argument goes, it could and would have done so expressly. We find this\nplausible, but note that ILU does not claim on appeal that the “remediation\ncosts” provision only has effect in the CERCLA context. Rather, the thrust of\nits arguments, both in the court below and in this one, was that CERCLA-\nmandated remediation exemplified the type of activity that might generate\ncovered “remediation costs.”\n       LaGen also claims that ILU’s interpretation would render the Policy’s\ncoverage partially illusory, since BCII’s past pollution cannot be remediated\nunder ILU’s definition of that term (as the parties appear to agree). 23 ILU\nresponds that other provisions of the Policy, such as those relating to civil\n\n\ndeeming it ambiguous, the Court of Appeals did not invoke its duty to read the clause\nnarrowly; rather, it applied the more general rule, equally applicable in this case, that\ncontracts should be interpreted with context, common sense and typical business usage in\nmind. Belt Painting, 795 N.E.2d at 20-21; see also Colonial Oil Indus. Inc. v. Indian Harbor\nIns. Co., 528 F. App’x 71, 75 (2d Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (resolving another dispute over the\nscope of a pollution exclusion clause using only the same general rules, and not referring to\nthe narrow-reading canon).\n22 Under the Policy, “environmental laws” include “any federal, state, provincial, municipal\n\nor other local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, guidance documents (and governmental,\njudicial or administrative orders, correspondence and directives), regulations, and all\namendments thereto . . . governing the liability or responsibilities of the ‘insured’ with respect\nto ‘pollution conditions.’”\n23 Relatedly, LaGen further argues that restricting the meaning of “mitigation” and the other\n\ngeneral terms in light of the typical definition of “remediation” renders the former terms\nsuperfluous. See, e.g., In re Viking Pump, Inc., 52 N.E.3d 1144, 27 N.Y.3d 244, 257 (N.Y. May\n3, 2016) (insurance policies are interpreted to give effect to every term and to avoid\nsurplusage). But Belt Painting strongly suggests that the canon against surplusage is not a\ntrump card. Indeed, the Belt Painting court read a policy definition that explicitly used the\nword “fumes” not to encompass paint fumes. 100 N.Y.2d at 387.\n                                               11\n\f     Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 12     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30914\npenalties and claims for bodily injury and property damage, allow coverage for\nair pollution costs. But LaGen’s basic point remains. If BCII’s emissions can’t\nbe remediated, then the Policy implicitly contemplates an impossibility: it\nprovides coverage for “remediation costs” resulting from “pollution conditions”\ncaused by BCII, and “pollution conditions” are defined elsewhere to include air\npollution. 24 Thus, on ILU’s account, the Policy provides coverage for expenses\nthat could never possibly exist (i.e., remediation costs arising from BCII’s\nemissions). Again, the argument has force, but we do not find that this tacit,\nmechanically arising contradiction suffices to render ILU’s reading wholly\nabsurd and therefore unambiguously wrong 25 – especially since even under\nILU’s reading, the contract indisputably still provides significant coverage for\nexpenses related to air pollution at BCII.\n       In sum, we consider neither party’s analysis of the term “remediation”\nentirely satisfying. Much like the insurer in Belt Painting, LaGen offers an\ninterpretation far more expansive than that term’s typical connotation among\ninformed practitioners. ILU’s interpretation avoids this problem, but arguably\nconflicts with the Policy’s particular and facially capacious definition and also\nraises the specter of contradictions within the Policy itself. Given the pros and\ncons of each reading, we conclude that a “reasonably intelligent person who\nhas examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is\ncognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally\nunderstood in th[is] particular . . . business” could plausibly adopt either one. 26\n\n\n\n\n24 The Policy states that “‘[p]ollution conditions’ means the discharge, . . . dispersal, release,\nescape, migration, or seepage of any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant, contaminant,\nor pollutant, including, but not limited to, smoke, soot, vapors, fumes . . . on, in, into, or upon\nland and structures thereupon, the atmosphere, surface water, or groundwater.”).\n25 See, e.g., In re Lipper Holdings, LLC, 1 A.D.3d 170, 171 (N.Y. App. Div. 2003).\n26 Alexander & Alexander Servs., Inc. v. These Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London,\n\nEngland, 136 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 1998).\n                                               12\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218           Page: 13     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30914\nThus, the scope of the term “remediation costs,” as used in the Policy, is\nambiguous and must be resolved, if possible, in light of extrinsic evidence. 27\n       That job is typically for the trier of fact. 28 Indeed, the Second Circuit has\nrepeatedly suggested that under New York law and the Federal Rules, when a\ncontract is ambiguous and extrinsic evidence of the parties’ actual intent\nexists, summary judgment is categorically impermissible. 29 However, other\nauthority suggests that if a court finds the extrinsic evidence overwhelmingly\nfavorable to one side, judgment as a matter of law may be appropriate. 30\n\n\n27 See generally In re Viking Pump, Inc., 52 N.E.3d 1144, 27 N.Y.3d 244, 258 (N.Y. May 3,\n2016) (“[A] contract is not ambiguous ‘if the language it uses has a definite and precise\nmeaning, unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the [agreement] itself, and\nconcerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.’” (quoting Selective\nIns.

Under New York law,\n\ninterpretation of an ambiguous contract remains a matter of law if there is no extrinsic\nevidence or if the extrinsic evidence is “itself conclusory and will not resolve the equivocality\nof the contract.” Id. (emphasis added); Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. v. Wesolowski, 305 N.E.2d\n907, 909-10 (N.Y. 1973). Neither is true here: the parties have submitted extrinsic evidence\nthat could potentially shed light on the actual intent behind the Policy, and the evidence is\nnot conclusory.\n29 See Alexander & Alexander Servs., 136 F.3d at 86 (“If the court must resort to extrinsic\n\nevidence to ascertain the correct and intended meaning of a term, material questions of fact\nnecessarily exist. . . .

New Coleman Holdings Inc., 174 F.3d 65, 72 n.5\n(2d Cir. 1999))).\n31 Most of the parties’ assertedly extrinsic evidence pertains to the typical connotations of the\n\nterms “remediation,” “mitigate,” and “abate.” See supra notes 17-19 and accompanying text.\nAs discussed above, it is unclear whether this evidence is really extrinsic evidence to be\nconsidered after a finding of ambiguity, or interpretive evidence to be weighed in determining\nwhether ambiguity exists. See supra note 17. Regardless, the evidence gives each side\nadditional grist for the mill, as discussed above, and does not overwhelmingly favor one side\nor the other. The remaining relevant extrinsic evidence most prominently includes an expert\nreport averring that environmental insurance policies like the Policy have historically been\nused to cover costs from CERCLA-type cleanups and that insureds typically buy them for\nthat reason. This evidence favors ILU’s account of the parties’ intent and thus weighs against\nsummary judgment.\n32 See also Stern v. Cigna Grp. Ins., No. 07-0772-CV, 2008 WL 4950067, at *1 (2d Cir.

First, ILU focuses on LaGen’s\nupgrades to Unit 3 of BCII. 34 Pursuant to the consent decree, LaGen spent\nsome $20.6 million installing SNCR technology at Unit 3 of BCII. (LaGen’s\nalleged violations implicated Units 1 and 2 of the plant only.) The district court\nfound that by reducing Unit 3’s emissions, this new technology indirectly\nmitigated the excess emissions from the other units, thereby “remediating”\nthem: “[The excess emissions] have effects on the environment, and by\nreducing future emissions, the past emissions can be ‘remediated’ as the\n\n\n\n\n33 The district court has already ruled that the Consent Decree Measures indirectly mitigate\nLaGen’s past pollution. If we leave that issue open, and, on remand, the trier of fact finds\nthat “remediation costs” include costs of indirect mitigation efforts, it will then have to\nconsider it anew. Whichever party is aggrieved by its resolution of the issue will then likely\nappeal. We address the issue here in order to prevent multiple appeals. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Marine Shale Processors, 81 F.3d 1361, 1369 n.8 (5th Cir. 1996) (“Despite the fact\nthat we vacate and remand the district court's Rule 54(b) judgment on other grounds, we\nreach the United States’ arguments concerning instructional and evidentiary error. . . .\nJudicial economy counsels that we reach these issues now, so that any error may be corrected\nin a single proceeding on remand.”); United States v.

Robinson,\n625 F.2d 1211, 1219 n.13 (5th Cir. 1980) (“We recognize that, on remand, the district court\nmay find that no “seizure” occurred or that, if it occurred, it was lawful, which would obviate\nthe necessity for considering whether the cocaine was the product of an unlawful seizure.\nNevertheless, because the district court may find that an unlawful seizure occurred, we deem\nit necessary, in the interest of judicial economy, to reach the issue whether the consent to\nsearch was tainted. Therefore, we assume for purposes of this discussion that an unlawful\nseizure occurred.”).\n34 ILU essentially repeats its Unit 3 arguments in disputing whether LaGen’s surrender of\n\nemissions allowances constituted “remediation.” The arguments are unavailing as to Unit 3,\nas described below, and are equally unavailing as to the allowances. ILU does note, in\npassing, that the allowances are to be surrendered in perpetuity, “by definition far beyond\nwhat any remediation of existing contamination might require even in theory.” But it appears\nthat LaGen only seeks indemnification for the surrender of allowances through 2017 in this\naction.\n                                              15\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218          Page: 16     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30914\nenvironment naturally eliminates the chemicals and, due to the lower\nemissions, there are fewer new chemicals to take their place.”\n       ILU disputes whether such indirect attenuation can amount to\n“remediation” under the Policy, as discussed above. But in any event, ILU\nargues, the Unit 3 upgrades do not in fact attenuate the past, allegedly\nexcessive emissions from Unit 1 and 2. Rather, they offset future emissions\nfrom those units. 35 Because “remediation” under the Policy must address past\npollution – a point that the district court accepted and LaGen does not dispute\n– the Unit 3 upgrades are not “remedial.” 36 At times, ILU phrases this\nargument differently, asserting that the upgrades are “compliance” measures\nmeant to ensure Units 1 and 2’s prospective compliance with environmental\nlaws. 37 Stated either way, the basic point is the same: any emissions avoided\n\n\n\n\n35 ILU also appears to argue that the Consent Decree Measures cannot be considered to offset\npast emissions because BCII is still emitting more than the law requires or than it did before\nthe EPA’s suit. It’s unclear whether that’s true, as it has not been established whether and\nto what extent LaGen actually violated the Clean Air Act. Regardless, ILU’s argument is\nunpersuasive. Any action that slows the rate of emissions into the atmosphere should allow\nthe emissions already present, which include past emissions, and the harms they caused to\ndiminish faster than they would have absent that action, regardless of whether the law\nrequires more. See infra note 39 and accompanying text.\n36 Cf. Cinergy Corp. v. Associated Elec. & Gas Ins. Servs., Ltd., 865 N.E.2d 571, 582 (Ind.\n\n2007) (“Notwithstanding the federal lawsuit's various references to seeking relief that would\n“remedy” past violations and harm to public health, the power companies acknowledge that\nthe injunctive remedy sought by the federal lawsuit is ‘to force Cinergy to install equipment\nto contain any further excess emissions and allow the environment to recover.’ The federal\nlawsuit is directed at preventing future public harm, not at obtaining control, mitigation, or\ncompensation for past or existing environmentally hazardous emissions.” (citation omitted)).\n37 In its prior Fifth Circuit appeal, LaGen did not assert that “remediation” included “costs\n\nassociated with installation of government mandated equipment and other actions taken\nsolely to bring the plant into compliance.” Louisiana Generating L.L.C. v. Illinois Union Ins.\nCo., 719 F.3d 328, 335 (5th Cir. 2013) (emphasis added). ILU stretches the record somewhat\nin stating that “if any of the Consent Decree costs are ‘compliance’ costs, they are by LaGen’s\nown admission not covered by the Policy.” This basic notion appears in various forms\nthroughout ILU’s briefing.\n                                              16\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218          Page: 17     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30914\nthrough the Unit 3 upgrades must be credited against future emissions, not\npast ones. 38\n       We are not persuaded. Because of BCII’s past emissions, there are today\nmore pollutants and pollutant byproducts in the region’s air, and more\npollution-related damage to natural resources, than there would be absent the\npast emissions. Future emissions contribute to this geographically diffuse,\nintermingled body of harm exactly the same way. And crucially, future\nemissions reductions accelerate the diminution of that body of harm; they do\nnot operate specifically on emissions released at any particular time. 39 For this\nreason, the Unit 3 upgrades do not mitigate only past emissions or only future\nemissions in any meaningful sense. Rather, the upgrades accelerate the\ndiminution of a homogenous body of pollution and pollution-related damage\nthat arose at least in part from past emissions. Therefore, the upgrades\nmitigate past pollution.\n       ILU also uses the structure and terminology of the consent decree, as\nwell as records of LaGen’s negotiations with the EPA, to argue that the parties\nmeant to substitute Unit 3 upgrades for more extensive upgrades to Units 1\nand 2, as part of an effort to reduce BCII’s overall emissions. Indeed, BCII is\nnow subject to a plant-wide Clean Air Act emissions permit, and the Unit 3\nupgrades appear necessary for the plant’s emissions to stay under the\npermitted limit. Thus, ILU concludes, the Unit 3 upgrades were meant to and\nin fact “ensure[] BCII’s overall compliance with the law going forward, rather\n\n\n\n\n38 To the extent ILU’s “compliance” argument has content other than this – i.e., to the extent\nILU argues that any action required by the Clean Air Act or similar authorities cannot be\n“remediation” – we find it unconvincing. See infra note 41 and accompanying text.\n39 The mechanism is as the district court described. Pollution and related harms dissipate at\n\na rate independent to some degree from their prevalence; reducing current emissions frees\nup this dissipation capacity, allowing existing harms to fade faster than they otherwise\nwould.\n                                             17\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218         Page: 18     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\nthan mitigating any existing ‘pollution condition.’” 40 But whether or not the\nUnit 3 upgrades are required for legal compliance going forward does not affect\nwhether they have the effect of remediating past pollution. Both can be true. 41\nAs for ILU’s arguments that the Unit 3 upgrades were intended to substitute\nfor more rigorous improvements to Units 1 and 2 or to offset those units’ future\nemissions only, the Policy does not cover expenses intended as remediation\ncosts; it covers remediation costs. The EPA’s and LaGen’s intent in negotiating\nthe Unit 3 upgrades, even if it can reliably be ascertained from the evidence\nILU cites, does not affect whether the upgrades meet the Policy’s definition of\nthat term.\n       Second, ILU targets LaGen’s environmental mitigation projects. The\nconsent decree required LaGen to spend at least $10.5 million on a variety of\nenvironmentally beneficial projects in the surrounding region. 42 ILU reiterates\nits argument, addressed above, that such efforts could only possibly offset\nfuture emissions. More fundamentally, however, ILU claims the projects do not\noffset or mitigate BCII’s emissions in any sense, because they operate on\nenvironmental harms “with absolutely no demonstrated connection to BCII’s\nemissions.” The EPA’s apparent belief that the projects do in fact mitigate\nBCII’s emissions (as suggested by the consent decree’s labeling them\n\n\n\n\n40 To the extent ILU is arguing that the Unit 3 upgrades are “compliance” measures because\nthey contribute to BCII’s compliance with aspects of the Clean Air Act other than this plant-\nspecific permit, its arguments fail. First, it has not been established whether and to what\nextent LaGen actually violated the Act; to say that the upgrades were required for Clean Air\nAct compliance begs a question. Second, Unit 3 upgrades cannot bring Units 1 and 2 into\ncompliance with the Act, because the Act imposes unit-specific technology requirements\nrather than (or in addition to) plant-wide emissions caps.\n41 Again, in its prior Fifth Circuit appeal, LaGen only declined to assert that “remediation”\n\nincluded “costs associated with installation of government mandated equipment and other\nactions taken solely to bring the plant into compliance.” Louisiana Generating L.L.C. v.\nIllinois Union Ins. Co., 719 F.3d 328, 335 (5th Cir. 2013) (emphasis added).\n42 See supra note 5 and accompanying text.\n\n                                             18\n\f      Case: 15-30914     Document: 00513624218        Page: 19     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\n“environmental mitigation projects”) is, in ILU’s view, a “unilateral” position\ndivorced from the project’s “substance.”\n        The district court properly rejected this argument. Assuming that\n“remediation” includes “mitigation,” as we do in this section, the projects\nremediate BCII’s emissions. ILU protests that the harms the projects address\nmay exist in the same area as the plant, but cannot be conclusively tied to the\nemissions from BCII’s smokestacks. But those emissions unquestionably\ncontributed to regional pollution and regional environmental consequences in\nturn, and the proposed projects aim to lessen both. 43 This is a loose connection,\nbut it suffices for “mitigation” as that term is generally understood, both in\ncommon parlance and environmental law. For example, under Section 404 of\nthe Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, developers who fill in\nwetlands must “mitigate” the damage, and can do so by paying to restore or\nconserve other nearby wetlands. 44 Obviously, such payments do not remedy\nthe actual damage done; rather, they offset its impact on the broader ecosystem\nwithin which that damage occurred. The same is true of these projects.\n        In sum, ILU failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nthe Consent Decree Measures indirectly mitigate LaGen’s past pollution. They\ndo.\n\n\n\n\n43The mechanism is the same as described above. See supra note 39.\n44 See 33 U.S.C. § 1344 (2012); 40 C.F.R. § 230.93 (2014). See generally Compensatory\nMitigation, ENVT’L PROT. AGENCY (May 26, 2016), https://www.epa.gov/cwa-\n404/compensatory-mitigation. Similar “mitigation” programs address the destruction of\nendangered species habitat, see, e.g., Conservation Banking, U.S. FISH & WILDLIFE SERV.\n(June 3, 2016), https://www.fws.gov/endangered/landowners/conservation-banking.html\n(“Conservation banks function to offset adverse impacts to these species that occurred\nelsewhere, sometimes referred to as off-site mitigation.”), and forests, see, e.g., MD. CODE\nANN., NAT. RES. § 5-1610.1 (West 2016).\n                                            19\n\f     Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 20     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30914\n                                                V\n       Third, and finally, ILU argues that LaGen’s claimed costs are\nunreasonable. Under the Policy, “remediation costs” include only “reasonable”\nexpenses. Thus, ILU need not indemnify LaGen to the extent LaGen overspent\non the Consent Decree Measures. 45\n       ILU’s reasonableness arguments mainly concern the Unit 3 SNCR\nupgrades. 46 The company relies on a report by its expert, Thomas Nunno,\nwhich argues that LaGen (1) unnecessarily hired outside contractors; (2) took\nan unduly long time to complete the upgrades, causing cost overruns; and (3)\nimproperly allocated expenses across BCII’s three units. 47 Nunno also\nobserved, and ILU emphasizes on appeal, that (4) another entity, Entergy\nCorporation, owns 42% of Unit 3 and therefore presumably must pay for part\nof the upgrades, meaning that some of the costs LaGen claims were not merely\n“unreasonable” but may not have been incurred by LaGen in the first place.\n       The district court rejected these points. Generally, it credited LaGen’s\nexplanations of the costs. Specifically, it stated that the outside contractors\nwere reasonably necessary, the delays were due to events beyond LaGen’s\ncontrol, the expenses were properly allocated, and LaGen was entitled to\nrepayment in full despite the split in the ownership.\n\n\n45 Again, although this issue will be moot if the trier of fact determines that indirect\nmitigation efforts are not “remedial” in the first place, we address it in the interest of judicial\neconomy. See supra note 33.\n46 ILU also challenges the reasonableness of LaGen’s valuation of surrendered emissions\n\nallowances, but we reject its challenge. To value the allowances it surrendered, LaGen\nmultiplied the number of allowances surrendered by the per-allowance market price, as\nreported by Platts, a well-known industry data provider. Relying solely on a brief expert\ndeclaration, ILU urges that LaGen’s valuation is flawed in several respects. The declaration\nis vague and conclusory, and the balance of the record does not illuminate it. Such evidence\ncannot defeat summary judgment. See, e.g., Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enters., Inc., 7 F.3d\n1203, 1207 (5th Cir. 1993).\n47 LaGen disputes Nunno’s credibility, pointing out that he lacked experience with SNCR\n\ntechnology. Maybe so, but given Nunno’s extensive relevant industry experience, we find his\nobservations are due at least some weight.\n                                               20\n\f   Case: 15-30914    Document: 00513624218        Page: 21   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30914\n      We consider ILU’s four points in turn.\n\n   1. Use of outside contractors\n\n      Nunno claims that LaGen should not have hired outside contractors\nbecause LaGen’s staff could have completed the contractors’ work themselves.\nHis report cites no evidence for this assertion, and Nunno admitted in a\ndeposition that he had none. Moreover, Nunno did not consider whether it was\nmore cost-effective for LaGen to use contractors rather than its own personnel.\nGiven this, ILU failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the\nreasonableness’ of LaGen’s contractor costs.\n\n   2. Delay-related cost overruns\n\n      Nunno claims that the Unit 3 upgrades took an unreasonably long time.\nCiting evidence unearthed during discovery, he argues that LaGen’s\nconstruction contractor, Bowen Engineering, was guilty of “slow materials\ndelivery and slow performance . . . in the months of December 2013 and\nJanuary 2014”; that LaGen accordingly instructed Bowen to bring on more\nhelp in order to meet its deadlines under the consent decree; and that Bowen\ncharged LaGen millions of dollars for doing so. Nunno further opines that “the\nproject should not have been allowed to fall behind schedule” because LaGen\nhad several staff members and consultants “to maintain track of the project\nprogress and budget.”\n      LaGen’s expert, Colin Campbell, retorts that any extra personnel costs\nwere inevitable, due both to the “highly compressed” timeline for completion of\nthe Unit 3 upgrades and the “unavoidable disruptions that occurred during\nconstruction.” LaGen’s contractor William Sargent clarifies that the project\nwas being carried out during the infamous “polar vortex” winter of 2013-14 and\nthat “the discovery of lead paint on the structural steel created a twenty-four\nday delay . . . as abatement work was completed.” It also appears that an\n                                       21\n\f    Case: 15-30914    Document: 00513624218     Page: 22   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-30914\nabandoned pipe was discovered during construction and had to be removed,\ncausing further delays.\n      In his deposition, Nunno, citing weather records and his personal\nexperience in power plant construction, responded that the weather was not so\ncold so as to preclude work on the upgrades. He also argued that it would have\nbeen far more cost-effective for LaGen to pay penalties to the EPA, or to invoke\nthe consent decree’s force majeure clause, than to bring on more help in order\nto overcome the delays and meet the deadline.\n      Given the partially contradictory evidence in the record, and viewing\nthat evidence in the light most favorable to ILU, we find there is a genuine\ndispute of fact as to whether LaGen’s delay-related cost overruns were\nreasonable. The district court erred in entering summary judgment for LaGen\non this issue.\n\n   3. Allocation of expenses\n\n      In some cases, LaGen used the same machinery and services to upgrade\nall three of the plant’s units. The parties dispute what portion of the resulting\ncost should be attributed to Unit 3 as opposed to Units 1 and 2 (for which\nLaGen is not claiming coverage).\n      First, LaGen allocated one-third of the cost of plant-wide elevator, power\ntransformer, water treatment, and air compression services to Unit 3. Nunno\nclaims, and LaGen does not appear to dispute, that Unit 3’s operation will\nrequire more use of the installed air compressors and power transformer than\nthe other units. But as Campbell notes, although Nunno’s proposed allocation\nmethod is plausible, there are equally logical ways to allocate the cost of these\nservices that would favor LaGen even more than a three-way split. Campbell\nalso observes that there is no applicable industry standard for allocating these\ncosts; indeed, Nunno does not assert that his proposed allocation conforms to\n\n                                       22\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218         Page: 23     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\nan industry standard or that LaGen’s does not. Given this, LaGen’s allocation\nof the power transformer and air compression costs cannot be deemed\nunreasonable. 48\n       As for the elevator, Nunno, citing the deposition of NRG project manager\nMichael Proffit, claims the Unit 3 work did not require the use of an elevator\nat all. Campbell, citing Sargent’s affidavit, says that elevator service was\nprovided to each unit. LaGen also claims that Proffit lacked firsthand\nknowledge of the upgrade project and left NRG before it concluded. The\nunderlying evidence here is squarely contradictory, and although Proffit’s\nfirsthand knowledge may be disputed, his testimony is considerably more\ndetailed than Sargent’s. Given this, a reasonable factfinder could determine\nthat the elevator was not used for Unit 3 (and, in turn, that no portion of its\ncost could reasonably be attributed to that unit). Thus, summary judgment was\nimproper on this issue.\n       Finally, as for the water treatment costs, Nunno’s report indicates that\nthey should not be attributed to Unit 3, but provides no basis for that assertion.\nThus, there is no genuine dispute of material fact on this issue.\n       Second, Nunno opines that only 30.4% of Bowen’s work can be attributed\nto Unit 3. He reaches this result through an ad-hoc set of calculations based on\nBowen’s invoices to LaGen. Campbell, LaGen’s expert, was “unable to discern\nfrom the data provided in [Nunno’s] report how this value was calculated” and\ninstead states that a 31.34% allocation is appropriate, as does Sargent. Given\nthe narrow differences between the estimates offered and the inevitable\nimprecision involved in splitting succinctly documented expenses among\n\n\n\n48In this instance, our reasonableness review is legal in nature because the underlying facts\nare apparently undisputed. See Cont’l Sav. Ass’n v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 762 F.2d 1239,\n1243 (5th Cir. 1985) (“While generally a question of fact, reasonableness becomes a question\nof law if the facts are undisputed.”).\n                                             23\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218          Page: 24     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30914\ndifferent units, there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether\nLaGen’s experts’ estimate is reasonable. Thus, we affirm summary judgment\non this issue. 49\n       Third, Nunno claims that LaGen evenly allocated engineering design\ncosts across the three units and disputes that allocation, offering evidence that\nUnits 1 and 2 were more complex and required more design work. Campbell\nand Sargent respond that in fact, the design contractor “provided a break-out\nof their cost by unit on each invoice” and that coverage for the Unit 3 upgrades\nshould follow that allocation. The data attached to Nunno’s report appear to\nagree: NRG’s records attribute less-than-even shares of several of the design\ncontractor’s invoices to Unit 3, and those less-than-even shares affect the total\namount LaGen claims for the Unit 3 upgrades. However, Nunno asserted in\nhis deposition that NRG’s records bundled unrelated expenses into its entries\nfor the relevant invoices, and that the underlying invoices actually indicate an\neven split of SNCR design expenses across the three units. We discern a\ngenuine dispute of material fact in this complicated back-and-forth. Thus,\nsummary judgment was improper as to whether the design expenses were\nunreasonably allocated.\n\n     4. Split ownership of Unit 3\n\n       Entergy Corporation owns 42% of Unit 3. ILU asserts, and LaGen does\nnot appear to dispute, that Entergy was therefore “responsible for 42% of [the\nUnit 3 upgrade] costs.” However, LaGen plausibly argues that even if it can\neventually recover some of its expenses from Entergy, New York law and the\n\n\n\n\n49The record suggests that LaGen may previously have sought a 32% allocation of Bowen’s\nwork to Unit 3. In its appeal briefing, however, LaGen broadly endorses Sargent’s work and\ndoes not contest its experts’ 31.34% calculation. Thus, we find no genuine dispute of material\nfact as to whether LaGen is entitled to that allocation.\n                                             24\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218           Page: 25     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30914\nPolicy still require ILU to fully indemnify LaGen. 50 The district court ruled for\nLaGen on this basis. But in its appeal briefing, ILU clarifies that it is not\nconcerned about whether LaGen can eventually obtain repayment from\nEntergy, but whether LaGen has actually incurred the full cost of the upgrades\nin the first place, as required for coverage under the Policy. 51\n       The evidence ILU cites on this point is inconclusive: it generally\nacknowledges Entergy’s stake in Unit 3, but does not suggest that Entergy\nactually paid for any of the upgrades or has already reimbursed LaGen.\nNevertheless, drawing all reasonable inferences from the undisputed\ncontractual relationship between Entergy and LaGen in ILU’s favor, we find\nthat a genuine dispute of material fact exists on this issue.\n                                               VI\n       Finally, ILU appeals the district court’s denial of a continuance. In the\nlower court, ILU filed motions to compel discovery on various issues,\nculminating in a motion to defer summary judgment proceedings to\naccommodate further discovery. 52 The district court denied that ultimate\n\n\n\n\n50 Cf. Winkelmann v. Excelsior Ins. Co., 650 N.E.2d 841 (N.Y. 1995) (“Subrogation is the\nprinciple by which an insurer, having paid losses of its insured, is placed in the position of its\ninsured so that it may recover from the third party legally responsible for the loss. . . . An\ninsurer’s subrogation rights accrue upon payment of the loss. At that point, an insurer who\nhas paid the policy limits possesses the derivative and limited rights of the insured and may\nproceed directly against the negligent third party to recoup the amount paid.” (citations\nomitted)).\n51 Under the Policy, remediation costs must be “incurred” by LaGen for ILU’s obligation to\n\nattach.

We note, however, that many\nof ILU’s requests for additional discovery relate only to arguments which we\nhave deemed unavailing for purposes of summary judgment. In regard to these\narguments, having closely reviewed the continuance motion, ILU’s briefing,\nand the relevant portions of the extant record, we find that further discovery\nwould not alter our analysis. 53 Thus, if and when the district court rules on\nILU’s discovery requests, it need only consider them insofar as they relate to\ngenuine disputes of material fact, as identified in this opinion.\n                                           VII\n       We summarize the results of our necessarily complicated analysis. We\nuphold the district court’s ruling that the Consent Decree Measures indirectly\nmitigate BCII’s past pollution. There is no genuine issue of material fact on\nthis point, nor would further discovery create one. However, it is unclear\nwhether indirect mitigation and abatement efforts qualify in the first place as\n“remediation,” and their costs as “remediation costs,” under the Policy. Thus,\na genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether LaGen is entitled to\nindemnification for any of the costs of the Consent Decree Measures.\n\n\n\n\n53 For example, ILU’s appeal briefing stresses its purported need for further discovery of\nsettlement communications between LaGen and EPA, arguing that such evidence might\ndemonstrate that the EPA accepted the Unit 3 upgrades and allowance surrenders in\nexchange for more extensive work on Units 1 and 2. But any such evidence would be legally\nirrelevant: as explained above, the parties’ negotiations over and intent concerning the\nConsent Decree Measures do not bear on whether those measures in fact remediate BCII’s\npollution and therefore qualify as remedial under the Policy.\n                                           26\n\f   Case: 15-30914   Document: 00513624218     Page: 27   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                               No. 15-30914\n      Moreover, even if indirect mitigation efforts can give rise to covered\n“remediation costs,” genuine disputes of material fact exist as to whether\nLaGen’s claimed costs are unreasonable. Specifically, it is unclear whether\nLaGen’s claimed costs include costs that Entergy paid; design and elevator\ncosts properly attributable to Units 1 and 2; and unreasonable delay-related\ncost overruns.\n      Accordingly, we VACATE summary judgment in its entirety and\nREMAND for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    27\n\f",

In an ensuing consent decree, LaGen promised to upgrade part of its\npower plant, surrender emissions allowances, and fund various environmental\nprojects. LaGen asked its insurer, Illinois Union (“ILU”), to pay the costs of\nthese measures, arguing that they qualified as “remediation costs” under\nLaGen’s policy. ILU refused.

In\n February 2005 and December 2006 the EPA sent LaGen Notices of\n Violation (“NOVs”) alleging that certain major modifications\n performed without a permit at BCII in 1998 and 1999 caused net\n emissions increases in violation of the [Clean Air Act]. In January\n 2009, NRG Energy, LaGen’s parent, purchased a Custom Premises\n Pollution Liability Insurance Policy (“the [P]olicy”) from ILU to\n cover a large number of its facilities, including BCII. The effective\n date of the [P]olicy is January 22, 2009.\n       On February 18, 2009, the EPA filed . . . suit over the\n modifications made to BCII, asserting violations of the [Clean Air\n Act] and Louisiana environmental laws. . . . The suit allege[d] that\n the previous owner of BCII did work on the plant that increased\n certain emissions which under applicable law would be considered\n “major modifications” and would have required a Prevention of\n Significant Deterioration of Air Quality permit (“PSD permit”)\n before being completed. The suit also allege[d] that the plant\n modifications failed to employ best available control technology\n (“BACT”) to limit emissions, as required by the CAA and Louisiana\n law. The complaints allege[d] that since acquiring BCII, LaGen\n ha[d] continued to operate the plant without seeking a PSD permit\n for the modifications. As a result, the complaints assert[ed], BCII\n ha[d] emitted excess amounts of regulated pollutants into the air.\n ...\n        LaGen sought coverage from ILU under the [P]olicy for legal\n fees associated with the underlying EPA suit, and ILU denied that\n the EPA suit was covered by the [P]olicy. LaGen filed suit in\n Louisiana federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that ILU\n ha[d] a duty to defend and indemnify LaGen in the EPA suit. The\n district court bifurcated the trial between the duty to defend and\n the duty to indemnify. . . . In a January 30, 2012 order, the district\n court granted summary judgment for LaGen with regard to the\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218          Page: 3     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30914\n       duty to defend and denied the motion for summary judgment filed\n       by ILU. 1\n       On ILU’s motion, the district court certified its January 30 order for\ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). We accepted the appeal and\naffirmed, finding that the relief the EPA sought, including civil penalties, the\nsurrender of LaGen’s emission allowances, and “other appropriate actions to\nremedy, mitigate, and offset the harm to public health and the environment\ncaused by the [alleged] violations,” potentially fell within the [P]olicy’s\ncoverage for “‘claims, remediation costs, and associated legal defense expenses\n. . . as a result of a pollution condition’ at a covered location.” 2 Because New\nYork law, which governs the Policy, gave insurers an “exceedingly broad” duty\nto defend, enforceable “whenever the allegations of the complaint suggest . . .\na reasonable possibility of coverage,” ILU had a duty to defend LaGen against\nthe EPA’s allegations. 3\n\n\n\n1 Louisiana Generating L.L.C. v.

LaGen broadly alleges that in this appeal, ILU “ignores key [prior] rulings\nfrom this court concerning the meaning of the pollution policy” and “fails to recognize the\nimport” of the earlier decision. But LaGen does not appear to argue that we previously\nresolved any of the specific issues now in dispute.\n         The district court, for its part, seemed to suggest that our earlier decision held that\n“remediation” should be understood as synonymous with the dictionary definitions of “abate”\nand “mitigate.” If this was the district court’s view, it was mistaken. In fact, we stated only\nthat under the Policy, “‘[r]emediation costs’ are defined very broadly to include expenses\nincurred to redress pollution in compliance with environmental law, including, inter alia,\ncosts associated with investigating, mitigating or abating pollution. This language . . .\npotentially covers the multiple prayers for relief in the EPA complaint which seek to require\nLaGen to mitigate, offset and remediate the alleged past pollution.” Louisiana Generating,\n719 F.3d at 335. As this excerpt makes clear, we did not explain the meaning of “mitigate” or\n“abate” in our earlier decision, nor did we hold that the costs of the measures the EPA sought\nwere “remediation costs.” Nor did we need to: in the prior appeal, our task was to determine\nwhether the Consent Decree Measures (which had not yet been finalized) “potentially” were\nremediation costs, and in turn, whether there was a “reasonable possibility” that the Policy’s\nterms encompassed them. Id. at 335 (emphasis added).\n                                               3\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218         Page: 4    Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\n       Around the same time, the EPA and LaGen settled the underlying\ndispute and negotiated a consent decree. In relevant part, the decree required\nLaGen to (1) install selective non-catalytic reduction (“SNCR”) technology\nupgrades at Unit 3 of BCII, a part of the plant not alleged to have been out of\ncompliance in the EPA’s suit; (2) surrender certain emissions allowances; 4 and\n(3) pay for a variety of “environmental mitigation projects.” 5\n       LaGen sought indemnification from ILU for the costs of these measures\n(hereinafter the “Consent Decree Measures”), asserting that they were\n“remediation costs” under the Policy. ILU refused. Both parties then moved in\nthe ongoing district court action for summary judgment on the indemnification\nissue. In the alternative, ILU moved to postpone summary judgment\nproceedings to allow further discovery.\n       The district court granted summary judgment for LaGen. First, the court\nfound that the Policy’s “remediation costs” language encompassed projects that\ngenerally offset pollution or moderated its effects, rather than only projects\nthat physically removed or contained pollution. Second, it found that each of\nthe Consent Decree Measures would “remediate” pollution in this way,\nobligating ILU to pay for them. Third, it found that the costs LaGen incurred\nto complete the Consent Decree Measures were reasonable, entitling the\ncompany to coverage in full. The court also denied ILU’s request for a\ncontinuance and further discovery, stating that ILU “failed to satisfactorily\nexplain its position to the Court.”\n       ILU appealed.\n\n\n\n\n4 An emissions allowance confers the right to emit a certain amount of pollution.\n5  These included electric vehicle infrastructure improvements throughout southern\nLouisiana; restoration of national parks, United States Forest Service lands, and a nearby\nlake; solar panel installation “at local schools, government-owned facilities, or facilities\nowned by nonprofit groups”; energy efficiency upgrades; and other projects yet to be defined.\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218          Page: 5     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n\n                                              II\n       “This court reviews the district court’s grant of summary judgment de\nnovo, applying the same legal standards as the district court.” 6 “The court shall\ngrant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” 7 “The court must view the facts developed below in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.” 8\n       New York law governs the Policy. 9 As the Second Circuit explained in\nanother insurance coverage dispute:\n       Under New York law “the initial interpretation of a contract is a\n       matter of law for the court to decide.” Included in this initial\n       interpretation is the threshold question of whether the terms of\n       the contract are ambiguous. An ambiguity exists where the terms\n       of a contract could suggest “more than one meaning when viewed\n       objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined\n       the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is\n       cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as\n       generally understood in the particular trade or business.”\n       Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of contract terms can arise\n       either from the language itself or from inferences that can be\n       drawn from this language. Hence, “only where the language and\n       the inferences to be drawn from it are unambiguous” may a district\n       court “construe a contract as a matter of law and grant summary\n       judgment accordingly.”\n             If the court finds that the contract is not ambiguous it should\n       assign the plain and ordinary meaning to each term and interpret\n       the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence.

BCII is\n\nundisputedly a “covered location.”\n                                              6\n\f     Case: 15-30914     Document: 00513624218        Page: 7    Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                    No. 15-30914\nneutralize, or immobilize ‘pollution conditions’ to the extent required by\n‘environmental law.’” ILU argues that this definition cannot possibly\nencompass the costs for which LaGen seeks indemnification. According to ILU,\na reasonable interpreter familiar with the customs and usages of modern-day\nbusiness practice would understand “remediation,” in the air pollution context,\nto connote only “physically remov[ing], contain[ing], or treat[ing] contaminants\nalready in the air or address[ing] harms they caused to land, water, structures,\nanimals, or persons.”\n       Because the Consent Decree Measures cannot and do not accomplish\nthis, ILU insists, they are not remediation measures, and LaGen’s expenses in\ncarrying them out are not “remediation costs” under the Policy. 13 ILU\nacknowledges that some of the words the Policy uses in defining “remediation\ncosts,” chiefly “mitigate” and “abate,” appear to suggest a broader notion of\nremediation, but argues that those words are better understood to denote\ndirect, physical remediation, and must in any event be “read in a manner\nconsistent with the ‘remediation costs’ they define, not to stretch the concept\nof ‘remediation’ beyond its logical limits.” Even assuming, then, that the\nConsent Decree Measures indirectly offset the harm of BCII’s past pollution,\nthey are still not “remedial” in nature, and their costs are not “remediation\ncosts.” 14\n       The district court rejected ILU’s argument. It interpreted New York law\nto reject “the maxim that ‘environmental law terms’ should be treated as ‘terms\nof art,’ [and] instead demonstrate[] that ambiguous terms are interpreted\nagainst insurers and in a manner that a reasonable businessperson would\n\n\n\n13 The parties appear to agree that BCII’s past emissions cannot be “remediated” by any\nmeans (including the Consent Decree Measures) under ILU’s definition of the term.\n14 As discussed below, ILU does not concede that the measures actually offset the harm of\n\nBCII’s past pollution, whether directly or indirectly.\n                                           7\n\f     Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 8      Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30914\nexpect.” Accordingly, the court opined, “‘mitigate’ and ‘abate’ are to be given a\nconstruction congruent with their plain meaning and the expectations of a\nreasonable insured.” The court concluded that these terms’ “plain meaning”\nincluded their “traditional[]” dictionary definitions, and applied those broad\ndefinitions in determining whether the Consent Decree Measures qualified as\n“remediation” under the Policy. 15\n       In our view, this was error – at least at the summary judgment stage.\nUnder New York law, courts can and often must look beyond the dictionary\nand other such general-purpose sources in reading contracts: when a term in a\ncontract has a special, widely understood meaning in the business context in\nwhich the contract was executed, that meaning bears on the proper\ninterpretation of the term. 16 The court below gestured toward this principle in\nmentioning the “reasonable businessperson’s” expectation. But fully applying\nthe principle leads to a more equivocal result than that court reached.\n       On one hand, there is considerable evidence that in environmental law\nand related business practice, the term “remediation” is primarily used to refer\nto the physical, geographically focused containment and removal of pollutants\nand the damage they have caused, not to measures that indirectly reduce their\neffect in the broader environment. 17 In particular, “remediation” is associated\n\n\n15 Specifically, the district court wrote that “the definition of “mitigate” traditionally includes\nthe notion of becoming “‘less severe’” or “‘less harsh or hostile.’” Similarly, “abate” is often\ndefined using language such as “‘reduce in degree’” or “‘moderate.’” . . . [T]he Court will use\nthe plain meaning of “mitigate” and “abate” to determine whether either party is entitled to\nsummary judgment.” The court was quoting a LaGen memorandum that in turn quoted the\nMerriam-Webster dictionary.\n16 See, e.g., Morgan Stanley Grp.

LaGen correctly notes that these terms\nare routinely used to refer to indirect, non-physical remedial efforts, both in\ncommon speech and in industries subject to environmental regulation. 19\n       But even though the Policy uses these broad words to define\n“remediation costs,” New York law suggests that the usual, narrower meaning\nof that term is still relevant. In Belt Painting Corp. v. TIG Insurance Co., the\nNew York Court of Appeals considered an insurance policy that excluded\ncoverage for harms caused by “pollutants,” which the policy defined to include\n“any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant including . . .\nfumes.” The court found that “reasonable minds [could] disagree as to whether\nthe exclusion” barred coverage for claims of injury due to indoor exposure to\npaint fumes, and accordingly rejected the insurer’s claim that the contract was\nunambiguous on this point. It reasoned that the insurer’s literal, broad reading\nof the policy’s definition of “pollutants” would “infinitely enlarge the scope of\nthe term ‘pollutants,’ and seemingly contradict both a ‘common speech’\nunderstanding of the relevant terms and the reasonable expectations of a\nbusinessperson.” 20 Belt Painting indicates that in New York, when a contract’s\nspecific, facially expansive definition of a term is in tension with the term’s\nusual meaning, the former does not control as a matter of law; rather, the\ntension may indicate ambiguity. 21\n\n\n19 See, e.g., supra note 15; U.S. Envtl.

See\nBelt Painting, 795 N.E.2d at 17 (“[P]olicy exclusions are given a strict and narrow\nconstruction, with any ambiguity resolved against the insurer.”). Nonetheless, Belt Painting\nis still instructive in this case. In parsing the exclusion clause’s definition of “pollutant” and\n                                               10\n\f    Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 11     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30914\n       LaGen’s other arguments have force, but ultimately do not dispel the\nprospect of ambiguity. LaGen notes that ILU’s focus on “CERCLA-type”\ncleanups is unmoored from the actual text of the Policy. Indeed, the Policy\nstates that remediation costs include those required by “environmental law,”\nwhich it defines very broadly; 22 in contrast, other parts of the Policy specifically\ninvoke CERCLA. If ILU meant to limit “remediation” to the CERCLA context,\nthe argument goes, it could and would have done so expressly. We find this\nplausible, but note that ILU does not claim on appeal that the “remediation\ncosts” provision only has effect in the CERCLA context. Rather, the thrust of\nits arguments, both in the court below and in this one, was that CERCLA-\nmandated remediation exemplified the type of activity that might generate\ncovered “remediation costs.”\n       LaGen also claims that ILU’s interpretation would render the Policy’s\ncoverage partially illusory, since BCII’s past pollution cannot be remediated\nunder ILU’s definition of that term (as the parties appear to agree). 23 ILU\nresponds that other provisions of the Policy, such as those relating to civil\n\n\ndeeming it ambiguous, the Court of Appeals did not invoke its duty to read the clause\nnarrowly; rather, it applied the more general rule, equally applicable in this case, that\ncontracts should be interpreted with context, common sense and typical business usage in\nmind. Belt Painting, 795 N.E.2d at 20-21; see also Colonial Oil Indus. Inc. v. Indian Harbor\nIns. Co., 528 F. App’x 71, 75 (2d Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (resolving another dispute over the\nscope of a pollution exclusion clause using only the same general rules, and not referring to\nthe narrow-reading canon).\n22 Under the Policy, “environmental laws” include “any federal, state, provincial, municipal\n\nor other local laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, guidance documents (and governmental,\njudicial or administrative orders, correspondence and directives), regulations, and all\namendments thereto . . . governing the liability or responsibilities of the ‘insured’ with respect\nto ‘pollution conditions.’”\n23 Relatedly, LaGen further argues that restricting the meaning of “mitigation” and the other\n\ngeneral terms in light of the typical definition of “remediation” renders the former terms\nsuperfluous. See, e.g., In re Viking Pump, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (N.Y. May\n3, 2016) (insurance policies are interpreted to give effect to every term and to avoid\nsurplusage). But Belt Painting strongly suggests that the canon against surplusage is not a\ntrump card. Indeed, the Belt Painting court read a policy definition that explicitly used the\nword “fumes” not to encompass paint fumes. 100 N.Y.2d at 387.\n                                               11\n\f     Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 12     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30914\npenalties and claims for bodily injury and property damage, allow coverage for\nair pollution costs. But LaGen’s basic point remains. If BCII’s emissions can’t\nbe remediated, then the Policy implicitly contemplates an impossibility: it\nprovides coverage for “remediation costs” resulting from “pollution conditions”\ncaused by BCII, and “pollution conditions” are defined elsewhere to include air\npollution. 24 Thus, on ILU’s account, the Policy provides coverage for expenses\nthat could never possibly exist (i.e., remediation costs arising from BCII’s\nemissions). Again, the argument has force, but we do not find that this tacit,\nmechanically arising contradiction suffices to render ILU’s reading wholly\nabsurd and therefore unambiguously wrong 25 – especially since even under\nILU’s reading, the contract indisputably still provides significant coverage for\nexpenses related to air pollution at BCII.\n       In sum, we consider neither party’s analysis of the term “remediation”\nentirely satisfying. Much like the insurer in Belt Painting, LaGen offers an\ninterpretation far more expansive than that term’s typical connotation among\ninformed practitioners. ILU’s interpretation avoids this problem, but arguably\nconflicts with the Policy’s particular and facially capacious definition and also\nraises the specter of contradictions within the Policy itself. Given the pros and\ncons of each reading, we conclude that a “reasonably intelligent person who\nhas examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is\ncognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally\nunderstood in th[is] particular . . . business” could plausibly adopt either one. 26\n\n\n\n\n24 The Policy states that “‘[p]ollution conditions’ means the discharge, . . . dispersal, release,\nescape, migration, or seepage of any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant, contaminant,\nor pollutant, including, but not limited to, smoke, soot, vapors, fumes . . . on, in, into, or upon\nland and structures thereupon, the atmosphere, surface water, or groundwater.”).\n25 See, e.g., In re Lipper Holdings, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (N.Y.

Rather, they offset future emissions\nfrom those units. 35 Because “remediation” under the Policy must address past\npollution – a point that the district court accepted and LaGen does not dispute\n– the Unit 3 upgrades are not “remedial.” 36 At times, ILU phrases this\nargument differently, asserting that the upgrades are “compliance” measures\nmeant to ensure Units 1 and 2’s prospective compliance with environmental\nlaws. 37 Stated either way, the basic point is the same: any emissions avoided\n\n\n\n\n35 ILU also appears to argue that the Consent Decree Measures cannot be considered to offset\npast emissions because BCII is still emitting more than the law requires or than it did before\nthe EPA’s suit. It’s unclear whether that’s true, as it has not been established whether and\nto what extent LaGen actually violated the Clean Air Act. Regardless, ILU’s argument is\nunpersuasive. Any action that slows the rate of emissions into the atmosphere should allow\nthe emissions already present, which include past emissions, and the harms they caused to\ndiminish faster than they would have absent that action, regardless of whether the law\nrequires more.

ILU stretches the record somewhat\nin stating that “if any of the Consent Decree costs are ‘compliance’ costs, they are by LaGen’s\nown admission not covered by the Policy.” This basic notion appears in various forms\nthroughout ILU’s briefing.\n                                              16\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218          Page: 17     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30914\nthrough the Unit 3 upgrades must be credited against future emissions, not\npast ones. 38\n       We are not persuaded. Because of BCII’s past emissions, there are today\nmore pollutants and pollutant byproducts in the region’s air, and more\npollution-related damage to natural resources, than there would be absent the\npast emissions. Future emissions contribute to this geographically diffuse,\nintermingled body of harm exactly the same way. And crucially, future\nemissions reductions accelerate the diminution of that body of harm; they do\nnot operate specifically on emissions released at any particular time. 39 For this\nreason, the Unit 3 upgrades do not mitigate only past emissions or only future\nemissions in any meaningful sense. Rather, the upgrades accelerate the\ndiminution of a homogenous body of pollution and pollution-related damage\nthat arose at least in part from past emissions. Therefore, the upgrades\nmitigate past pollution.\n       ILU also uses the structure and terminology of the consent decree, as\nwell as records of LaGen’s negotiations with the EPA, to argue that the parties\nmeant to substitute Unit 3 upgrades for more extensive upgrades to Units 1\nand 2, as part of an effort to reduce BCII’s overall emissions. Indeed, BCII is\nnow subject to a plant-wide Clean Air Act emissions permit, and the Unit 3\nupgrades appear necessary for the plant’s emissions to stay under the\npermitted limit. Thus, ILU concludes, the Unit 3 upgrades were meant to and\nin fact “ensure[] BCII’s overall compliance with the law going forward, rather\n\n\n\n\n38 To the extent ILU’s “compliance” argument has content other than this – i.e., to the extent\nILU argues that any action required by the Clean Air Act or similar authorities cannot be\n“remediation” – we find it unconvincing. See infra note 41 and accompanying text.\n39 The mechanism is as the district court described. Pollution and related harms dissipate at\n\na rate independent to some degree from their prevalence; reducing current emissions frees\nup this dissipation capacity, allowing existing harms to fade faster than they otherwise\nwould.\n                                             17\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218         Page: 18     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\nthan mitigating any existing ‘pollution condition.’” 40 But whether or not the\nUnit 3 upgrades are required for legal compliance going forward does not affect\nwhether they have the effect of remediating past pollution. Both can be true. 41\nAs for ILU’s arguments that the Unit 3 upgrades were intended to substitute\nfor more rigorous improvements to Units 1 and 2 or to offset those units’ future\nemissions only, the Policy does not cover expenses intended as remediation\ncosts; it covers remediation costs. The EPA’s and LaGen’s intent in negotiating\nthe Unit 3 upgrades, even if it can reliably be ascertained from the evidence\nILU cites, does not affect whether the upgrades meet the Policy’s definition of\nthat term.\n       Second, ILU targets LaGen’s environmental mitigation projects. The\nconsent decree required LaGen to spend at least $10.5 million on a variety of\nenvironmentally beneficial projects in the surrounding region. 42 ILU reiterates\nits argument, addressed above, that such efforts could only possibly offset\nfuture emissions. More fundamentally, however, ILU claims the projects do not\noffset or mitigate BCII’s emissions in any sense, because they operate on\nenvironmental harms “with absolutely no demonstrated connection to BCII’s\nemissions.” The EPA’s apparent belief that the projects do in fact mitigate\nBCII’s emissions (as suggested by the consent decree’s labeling them\n\n\n\n\n40 To the extent ILU is arguing that the Unit 3 upgrades are “compliance” measures because\nthey contribute to BCII’s compliance with aspects of the Clean Air Act other than this plant-\nspecific permit, its arguments fail. First, it has not been established whether and to what\nextent LaGen actually violated the Act; to say that the upgrades were required for Clean Air\nAct compliance begs a question. Second, Unit 3 upgrades cannot bring Units 1 and 2 into\ncompliance with the Act, because the Act imposes unit-specific technology requirements\nrather than (or in addition to) plant-wide emissions caps.\n41 Again, in its prior Fifth Circuit appeal, LaGen only declined to assert that “remediation”\n\nincluded “costs associated with installation of government mandated equipment and other\nactions taken solely to bring the plant into compliance.” Louisiana Generating L.L.C. v.\nIllinois Union Ins.

Assuming that\n“remediation” includes “mitigation,” as we do in this section, the projects\nremediate BCII’s emissions. ILU protests that the harms the projects address\nmay exist in the same area as the plant, but cannot be conclusively tied to the\nemissions from BCII’s smokestacks. But those emissions unquestionably\ncontributed to regional pollution and regional environmental consequences in\nturn, and the proposed projects aim to lessen both. 43 This is a loose connection,\nbut it suffices for “mitigation” as that term is generally understood, both in\ncommon parlance and environmental law. For example, under Section 404 of\nthe Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations, developers who fill in\nwetlands must “mitigate” the damage, and can do so by paying to restore or\nconserve other nearby wetlands. 44 Obviously, such payments do not remedy\nthe actual damage done; rather, they offset its impact on the broader ecosystem\nwithin which that damage occurred. The same is true of these projects.\n        In sum, ILU failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nthe Consent Decree Measures indirectly mitigate LaGen’s past pollution. They\ndo.\n\n\n\n\n43The mechanism is the same as described above. See supra note 39.\n44 See 33 U.S.C. § 1344 (2012); 40 C.F.R. § 230.93 (2014). See generally Compensatory\nMitigation, ENVT’L PROT.

Similar “mitigation” programs address the destruction of\nendangered species habitat, see, e.g., Conservation Banking, U.S. FISH & WILDLIFE SERV.\n(June 3, 2016), https://www.fws.gov/endangered/landowners/conservation-banking.html\n(“Conservation banks function to offset adverse impacts to these species that occurred\nelsewhere, sometimes referred to as off-site mitigation.”), and forests, see, e.g., MD. CODE\nANN., NAT. RES. § 5-1610.1 (West 2016).\n                                            19\n\f     Case: 15-30914        Document: 00513624218           Page: 20     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30914\n                                                V\n       Third, and finally, ILU argues that LaGen’s claimed costs are\nunreasonable. Under the Policy, “remediation costs” include only “reasonable”\nexpenses. Thus, ILU need not indemnify LaGen to the extent LaGen overspent\non the Consent Decree Measures. 45\n       ILU’s reasonableness arguments mainly concern the Unit 3 SNCR\nupgrades. 46 The company relies on a report by its expert, Thomas Nunno,\nwhich argues that LaGen (1) unnecessarily hired outside contractors; (2) took\nan unduly long time to complete the upgrades, causing cost overruns; and (3)\nimproperly allocated expenses across BCII’s three units. 47 Nunno also\nobserved, and ILU emphasizes on appeal, that (4) another entity, Entergy\nCorporation, owns 42% of Unit 3 and therefore presumably must pay for part\nof the upgrades, meaning that some of the costs LaGen claims were not merely\n“unreasonable” but may not have been incurred by LaGen in the first place.\n       The district court rejected these points. Generally, it credited LaGen’s\nexplanations of the costs. Specifically, it stated that the outside contractors\nwere reasonably necessary, the delays were due to events beyond LaGen’s\ncontrol, the expenses were properly allocated, and LaGen was entitled to\nrepayment in full despite the split in the ownership.\n\n\n45 Again, although this issue will be moot if the trier of fact determines that indirect\nmitigation efforts are not “remedial” in the first place, we address it in the interest of judicial\neconomy. See supra note 33.\n46 ILU also challenges the reasonableness of LaGen’s valuation of surrendered emissions\n\nallowances, but we reject its challenge. To value the allowances it surrendered, LaGen\nmultiplied the number of allowances surrendered by the per-allowance market price, as\nreported by Platts, a well-known industry data provider. Relying solely on a brief expert\ndeclaration, ILU urges that LaGen’s valuation is flawed in several respects. The declaration\nis vague and conclusory, and the balance of the record does not illuminate it. Such evidence\ncannot defeat summary judgment. See, e.g., Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6090\"><a href=\"/opinion/6090/travelers-ins-co-v-liljeberg-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (5th Cir. 1993).\n47 LaGen disputes Nunno’s credibility, pointing out that he lacked experience with SNCR\n\ntechnology. Maybe so, but given Nunno’s extensive relevant industry experience, we find his\nobservations are due at least some weight.\n                                               20\n\f   Case: 15-30914    Document: 00513624218        Page: 21   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30914\n      We consider ILU’s four points in turn.\n\n   1. Use of outside contractors\n\n      Nunno claims that LaGen should not have hired outside contractors\nbecause LaGen’s staff could have completed the contractors’ work themselves.\nHis report cites no evidence for this assertion, and Nunno admitted in a\ndeposition that he had none. Moreover, Nunno did not consider whether it was\nmore cost-effective for LaGen to use contractors rather than its own personnel.\nGiven this, ILU failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the\nreasonableness’ of LaGen’s contractor costs.\n\n   2. Delay-related cost overruns\n\n      Nunno claims that the Unit 3 upgrades took an unreasonably long time.\nCiting evidence unearthed during discovery, he argues that LaGen’s\nconstruction contractor, Bowen Engineering, was guilty of “slow materials\ndelivery and slow performance . . . in the months of December 2013 and\nJanuary 2014”; that LaGen accordingly instructed Bowen to bring on more\nhelp in order to meet its deadlines under the consent decree; and that Bowen\ncharged LaGen millions of dollars for doing so. Nunno further opines that “the\nproject should not have been allowed to fall behind schedule” because LaGen\nhad several staff members and consultants “to maintain track of the project\nprogress and budget.”\n      LaGen’s expert, Colin Campbell, retorts that any extra personnel costs\nwere inevitable, due both to the “highly compressed” timeline for completion of\nthe Unit 3 upgrades and the “unavoidable disruptions that occurred during\nconstruction.” LaGen’s contractor William Sargent clarifies that the project\nwas being carried out during the infamous “polar vortex” winter of 2013-14 and\nthat “the discovery of lead paint on the structural steel created a twenty-four\nday delay . . . as abatement work was completed.” It also appears that an\n                                       21\n\f    Case: 15-30914    Document: 00513624218     Page: 22   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-30914\nabandoned pipe was discovered during construction and had to be removed,\ncausing further delays.\n      In his deposition, Nunno, citing weather records and his personal\nexperience in power plant construction, responded that the weather was not so\ncold so as to preclude work on the upgrades. He also argued that it would have\nbeen far more cost-effective for LaGen to pay penalties to the EPA, or to invoke\nthe consent decree’s force majeure clause, than to bring on more help in order\nto overcome the delays and meet the deadline.\n      Given the partially contradictory evidence in the record, and viewing\nthat evidence in the light most favorable to ILU, we find there is a genuine\ndispute of fact as to whether LaGen’s delay-related cost overruns were\nreasonable. The district court erred in entering summary judgment for LaGen\non this issue.\n\n   3. Allocation of expenses\n\n      In some cases, LaGen used the same machinery and services to upgrade\nall three of the plant’s units. The parties dispute what portion of the resulting\ncost should be attributed to Unit 3 as opposed to Units 1 and 2 (for which\nLaGen is not claiming coverage).\n      First, LaGen allocated one-third of the cost of plant-wide elevator, power\ntransformer, water treatment, and air compression services to Unit 3. Nunno\nclaims, and LaGen does not appear to dispute, that Unit 3’s operation will\nrequire more use of the installed air compressors and power transformer than\nthe other units. But as Campbell notes, although Nunno’s proposed allocation\nmethod is plausible, there are equally logical ways to allocate the cost of these\nservices that would favor LaGen even more than a three-way split. Campbell\nalso observes that there is no applicable industry standard for allocating these\ncosts; indeed, Nunno does not assert that his proposed allocation conforms to\n\n                                       22\n\f     Case: 15-30914      Document: 00513624218         Page: 23     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30914\nan industry standard or that LaGen’s does not. Given this, LaGen’s allocation\nof the power transformer and air compression costs cannot be deemed\nunreasonable. 48\n       As for the elevator, Nunno, citing the deposition of NRG project manager\nMichael Proffit, claims the Unit 3 work did not require the use of an elevator\nat all. Campbell, citing Sargent’s affidavit, says that elevator service was\nprovided to each unit. LaGen also claims that Proffit lacked firsthand\nknowledge of the upgrade project and left NRG before it concluded. The\nunderlying evidence here is squarely contradictory, and although Proffit’s\nfirsthand knowledge may be disputed, his testimony is considerably more\ndetailed than Sargent’s. Given this, a reasonable factfinder could determine\nthat the elevator was not used for Unit 3 (and, in turn, that no portion of its\ncost could reasonably be attributed to that unit). Thus, summary judgment was\nimproper on this issue.\n       Finally, as for the water treatment costs, Nunno’s report indicates that\nthey should not be attributed to Unit 3, but provides no basis for that assertion.\nThus, there is no genuine dispute of material fact on this issue.\n       Second, Nunno opines that only 30.4% of Bowen’s work can be attributed\nto Unit 3. He reaches this result through an ad-hoc set of calculations based on\nBowen’s invoices to LaGen. Campbell, LaGen’s expert, was “unable to discern\nfrom the data provided in [Nunno’s] report how this value was calculated” and\ninstead states that a 31.34% allocation is appropriate, as does Sargent. Given\nthe narrow differences between the estimates offered and the inevitable\nimprecision involved in splitting succinctly documented expenses among\n\n\n\n48In this instance, our reasonableness review is legal in nature because the underlying facts\nare apparently undisputed.

Thus, we affirm summary judgment\non this issue. 49\n       Third, Nunno claims that LaGen evenly allocated engineering design\ncosts across the three units and disputes that allocation, offering evidence that\nUnits 1 and 2 were more complex and required more design work. Campbell\nand Sargent respond that in fact, the design contractor “provided a break-out\nof their cost by unit on each invoice” and that coverage for the Unit 3 upgrades\nshould follow that allocation. The data attached to Nunno’s report appear to\nagree: NRG’s records attribute less-than-even shares of several of the design\ncontractor’s invoices to Unit 3, and those less-than-even shares affect the total\namount LaGen claims for the Unit 3 upgrades. However, Nunno asserted in\nhis deposition that NRG’s records bundled unrelated expenses into its entries\nfor the relevant invoices, and that the underlying invoices actually indicate an\neven split of SNCR design expenses across the three units. We discern a\ngenuine dispute of material fact in this complicated back-and-forth. Thus,\nsummary judgment was improper as to whether the design expenses were\nunreasonably allocated.\n\n     4. Split ownership of Unit 3\n\n       Entergy Corporation owns 42% of Unit 3. ILU asserts, and LaGen does\nnot appear to dispute, that Entergy was therefore “responsible for 42% of [the\nUnit 3 upgrade] costs.” However, LaGen plausibly argues that even if it can\neventually recover some of its expenses from Entergy, New York law and the\n\n\n\n\n49The record suggests that LaGen may previously have sought a 32% allocation of Bowen’s\nwork to Unit 3. In its appeal briefing, however, LaGen broadly endorses Sargent’s work and\ndoes not contest its experts’ 31.34% calculation. Thus, we find no genuine dispute of material\nfact as to whether LaGen is entitled to that allocation.\n                                             24\n\f     Case: 15-30914       Document: 00513624218           Page: 25     Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30914\nPolicy still require ILU to fully indemnify LaGen. 50 The district court ruled for\nLaGen on this basis. But in its appeal briefing, ILU clarifies that it is not\nconcerned about whether LaGen can eventually obtain repayment from\nEntergy, but whether LaGen has actually incurred the full cost of the upgrades\nin the first place, as required for coverage under the Policy. 51\n       The evidence ILU cites on this point is inconclusive: it generally\nacknowledges Entergy’s stake in Unit 3, but does not suggest that Entergy\nactually paid for any of the upgrades or has already reimbursed LaGen.\nNevertheless, drawing all reasonable inferences from the undisputed\ncontractual relationship between Entergy and LaGen in ILU’s favor, we find\nthat a genuine dispute of material fact exists on this issue.\n                                               VI\n       Finally, ILU appeals the district court’s denial of a continuance. In the\nlower court, ILU filed motions to compel discovery on various issues,\nculminating in a motion to defer summary judgment proceedings to\naccommodate further discovery. 52 The district court denied that ultimate\n\n\n\n\n50 Cf.

We note, however, that many\nof ILU’s requests for additional discovery relate only to arguments which we\nhave deemed unavailing for purposes of summary judgment. In regard to these\narguments, having closely reviewed the continuance motion, ILU’s briefing,\nand the relevant portions of the extant record, we find that further discovery\nwould not alter our analysis. 53 Thus, if and when the district court rules on\nILU’s discovery requests, it need only consider them insofar as they relate to\ngenuine disputes of material fact, as identified in this opinion.\n                                           VII\n       We summarize the results of our necessarily complicated analysis. We\nuphold the district court’s ruling that the Consent Decree Measures indirectly\nmitigate BCII’s past pollution. There is no genuine issue of material fact on\nthis point, nor would further discovery create one. However, it is unclear\nwhether indirect mitigation and abatement efforts qualify in the first place as\n“remediation,” and their costs as “remediation costs,” under the Policy. Thus,\na genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether LaGen is entitled to\nindemnification for any of the costs of the Consent Decree Measures.\n\n\n\n\n53 For example, ILU’s appeal briefing stresses its purported need for further discovery of\nsettlement communications between LaGen and EPA, arguing that such evidence might\ndemonstrate that the EPA accepted the Unit 3 upgrades and allowance surrenders in\nexchange for more extensive work on Units 1 and 2. But any such evidence would be legally\nirrelevant: as explained above, the parties’ negotiations over and intent concerning the\nConsent Decree Measures do not bear on whether those measures in fact remediate BCII’s\npollution and therefore qualify as remedial under the Policy.\n                                           26\n\f   Case: 15-30914   Document: 00513624218     Page: 27   Date Filed: 08/04/2016\n\n\n\n                               No. 15-30914\n      Moreover, even if indirect mitigation efforts can give rise to covered\n“remediation costs,” genuine disputes of material fact exist as to whether\nLaGen’s claimed costs are unreasonable. Specifically, it is unclear whether\nLaGen’s claimed costs include costs that Entergy paid; design and elevator\ncosts properly attributable to Units 1 and 2; and unreasonable delay-related\ncost overruns.\n      Accordingly, we VACATE summary judgment in its entirety and\nREMAND for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    27\n\f</pre>",
