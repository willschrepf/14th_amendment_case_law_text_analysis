No. 1:12-CV-01166-RB-KBM)\n\n\nNancy L. Simmons of Law Offices of Nancy L. Simmons, P.C., Albuquerque,\nNew Mexico, for Plaintiff-Appellant.\n\nElizabeth L. German (Mary Keleher Castle, with her on the brief), German &\nAssociates, LLC, Albuquerque, New Mexico, for Defendants-Appellees.\n\n\nBefore BRISCOE, Chief Judge, MURPHY and GORSUCH, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nGORSUCH, Circuit Judge.\n\f      The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires public school\n\ndistricts that accept federal funding to furnish a “free appropriate public\n\neducation” to their disabled students. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1). Sometimes, of\n\ncourse, disputes arise over whether the school district is doing the job it’s agreed\n\nto do. This is one of those cases. Christine B., the mother of a student known in\n\nthese proceedings as A.F., contends that the school district failed to address\n\nappropriately her daughter’s disabilities in the educational program it formulated\n\nfor her.\n\n      When a dispute like this emerges, the parent and student must file an\n\nadministrative complaint with local school officials. See id. § 1415(b)(6),\n\n(f)(1)(A). Then the parties are instructed by statute to hold a “[p]reliminary\n\nmeeting” with an eye toward talking through the grievance and trying for an early\n\nresolution. Id. § 1415(f)(1)(B)(i). They can also choose to resolve their\n\ndifferences through mediation. Id. § 1415(e). But if no settlement satisfactory to\n\nboth sides comes to pass, the parties must proceed to a sort of trial, what IDEA\n\ncalls an “[i]mpartial due process hearing.” Id. § 1415(f). If the hearing still\n\ndoesn’t satisfy parent and student, an administrative appeal may follow. Id.\n\n§ 1415(g)(1). If the parent and student still remain “aggrieved by the findings\n\nand decision made” after this appeal process, they may then (and only then)\n\n“bring a civil action” in federal court. Id. § 1415(i)(2)(A). At the same time, if\n\nthe state fails to provide an appeals process, a party who is aggrieved by the\n\n                                          2\n\ffindings and decision in the subsection (f) trial-like proceeding may also proceed\n\nto court. Id. Plainly in all this, Congress sought to ensure access to courts for\n\nIDEA claims but only failing the success of the many alternative dispute\n\nopportunities it provided.\n\n      This case ended almost before it began. Christine B. filed her\n\nadministrative complaint, just as she had to. But before any hearing could be\n\nheld, she sought to mediate her dispute. And the choice proved fruitful, for in the\n\nend the parties signed a settlement agreement. Indeed, as a result of the\n\nsettlement, Christine B. asked the administrative agency to dismiss her IDEA\n\nclaims with prejudice, something the agency duly did.\n\n      But after ending her suit she sought to begin it again. Despite the\n\nsatisfactory result she received through mediation, Christine B. later took to mind\n\nthe thought she might sue — and she did. To be sure, her lawsuit didn’t seek to\n\npress a claim under IDEA, itself a tacit acknowledgment that her mediated\n\nsettlement precluded that option. Instead, she sued under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, though the\n\nallegations in her federal court complaint and those in her original IDEA\n\nadministrative complaint are nearly identical: both allege that A.F. suffers from\n\nthe same disabilities and both contend that the school district failed to take her\n\ndisabilities into account in her educational program. Agreeing with the school\n\ndistrict that Christine B. failed to exhaust available administrative remedies, the\n\n                                          3\n\fdistrict court dismissed her lawsuit and it is this result she now asks us to\n\noverturn.\n\n      There’s no doubt that it’s often possible to pursue claims under IDEA and\n\nother federal statutes seriatim just as Christine B. wishes to do. Indeed, Congress\n\nexpressly guaranteed as much, stating that IDEA’s promises and procedures don’t\n\nnecessarily extinguish one’s “rights . . . and remedies” under other federal laws\n\nlike the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). In fact, Congress\n\nadded this language to clarify its disagreement with the Supreme Court’s\n\nsuggestion in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), that a claim under IDEA\n\n(or, really, its predecessor statute, the Education of the Handicapped Act) should\n\nbe the exclusive federal statutory remedy for any education-related complaint by\n\ndisabled public school students.\n\n      But Congress didn’t stop there. After emphasizing that IDEA doesn’t\n\nalways preclude relief under laws like the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, Congress\n\nadded this caveat:\n\n      except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief\n      that is also available under [IDEA], the procedures under subsections (f)\n      and (g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the\n      action been brought under [IDEA].\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). So it is that, to bring a lawsuit under federal law that\n\n“seek[s] relief that is also available under” IDEA, you first must exhaust the\n\nprocedures set forth in subsections (f) and (g) “to the same extent as would be\n\n\n                                           4\n\frequired had the action been brought under” IDEA. And, as we’ve seen, to “bring\n\na civil action” under IDEA you must be “aggrieved by the findings and decision\n\nmade” after the administrative appeals process (or trial process if no appeal\n\nprocess is provided). Id. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n      It’s here where Christine B. faces a problem, just as the district court\n\nrecognized. She accepts that her current lawsuit “seek[s] relief that is also\n\navailable under” IDEA and thus triggers subsection (l)’s exhaustion requirement.\n\nTo be sure, her lawsuit seeks damages — a remedy that’s “ordinarily unavailable\n\nin administrative [IDEA] hearings.” Cudjoe v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 12, 297 F.3d\n\n1058, 1066 (10th Cir. 2002). But some time ago this court held that the\n\n“dispositive question” when assessing the applicability of subsection (l)’s\n\nexhaustion requirement isn’t whether the plaintiff seeks damages or some other\n\nparticular remedy, but “whether the plaintiff has alleged injuries that could be\n\nredressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administrative procedures and remedies.”\n\nPadilla ex rel. Padilla v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 233 F.3d 1268, 1274 (10th Cir. 2000)\n\n(emphasis added). Neither does Christine B. ask us to revisit Padilla or otherwise\n\ndispute that the injuries she seeks to redress in her lawsuit are indeed capable of\n\nbeing redressed to some degree by IDEA’s administrative procedures. And with\n\nthat, with an admission of subsection (l)’s applicability, it’s very hard to see how\n\nshe can satisfy it. Subsection (l) required her to exhaust the procedures set forth\n\nin subsections (f) and (g) to the same extent necessary to bring a civil action\n\n                                          5\n\funder IDEA itself. And to bring such an action she must be able to show that\n\nshe’s “aggrieved by the findings and decision” of the administrative trial\n\nauthorities described in subsection (f) or the administrative appellate authorities\n\ndescribed in subsection (g). Something she manifestly is not.\n\n      Coming at the point from a different angle, Christine B.’s problem is that\n\nthere’s only one exhaustion rule for IDEA claims and other federal claims seeking\n\nrelief also available under IDEA. It’s clear Christine B. cannot bring an IDEA\n\nlawsuit in federal court after choosing to settle her IDEA claims and agreeing to\n\ntheir dismissal with prejudice. She even tacitly concedes this by declining any\n\nattempt to raise them here. And from this it follows ineluctably that an ADA or\n\nRehabilitation Act or § 1983 lawsuit seeking the same relief is also barred.\n\n      Christine B. responds this way. She notes that subsection (f) permits the\n\nparties to opt out of the trial-like administrative process and pursue mediation\n\nunder subsection (e). See id. § 1415(f)(1)(B)(i). So by mediating her IDEA claim\n\nunder subsection (e), she says, she necessarily satisfied the procedures described\n\nin subsection (f). And given that no appeal is necessary or even available after a\n\nmediated settlement, subsection (g) is beside the point. It’s in this way, she\n\nargues, that she exhausted the administrative procedures available to her. Our\n\ndissenting colleague seems to adopt this same line of reasoning too.\n\n      The problem is this vision of exhaustion just isn’t the one embodied in the\n\nplain text of the statute. If subsection (l) said that to bring a federal lawsuit under\n\n                                           6\n\fthe ADA or Rehabilitation Act or Section 1983 you merely had to “satisfy the\n\nadministrative procedures under subsection (f),” we might be able to say that,\n\nbecause subsection (f) references subsection (e) and its provision of mediation as\n\nan alternative means of dispute resolution, Christine B. is free and clear to pursue\n\nher lawsuit. But that’s not what subsection (l) says. It says that to bring a civil\n\naction under federal law seeking the same relief IDEA supplies, you must exhaust\n\nthe procedures in subsections (f) and (g) “to the same extent” as you must to\n\nbring a civil action under IDEA itself. And to earn the right to bring a civil\n\naction under IDEA, it’s just an implacable fact that you must qualify under\n\nsubsection (i) as a party “aggrieved by the findings and decision” of\n\nadministrative trial or appellate authorities. And neither Christine B. nor the\n\ndissent even attempts to suggest she qualifies as that.\n\n      Without statutory text to help her, Christine B. urges us to examine\n\nprecedent. And it’s true enough that otherwise unlikely statutory interpretations\n\nsometimes look more attractive when backed by the force of precedent we’re\n\nobliged to obey. But that’s just not the case here either. Christine B. directs us\n\nfirst to Ellenberg ex rel. S.E. v. New Mexico Military Institute, 478 F.3d 1262\n\n(10th Cir. 2007). But Ellenberg held that subsection (l)’s exhaustion requirement\n\ndidn’t apply to the plaintiff’s federal claims there precisely because IDEA could\n\n“offer[] no relief” for the particular wrongs the plaintiff asserted. Id. at 1280-81.\n\nHere again and by contrast, Christine B. accepts that subsection (l)’s exhaustion\n\n                                           7\n\frequirements apply to all of her federal claims and argues only that she’s satisfied\n\nthose requirements — an argument that, as we’ve seen, the statutory text just\n\ncan’t bear. Had she contested the applicability of subsection (l) to her case, or\n\nperhaps asked us to revisit Padilla’s expansive view of subsection (l)’s reach, we\n\nmight have had a different case. Indeed, there are notes in the dissent that could\n\nbe read to suggest arguments along just those lines. But Christine B. has made no\n\nsuch argument for herself either in the district court or this one.\n\n      Neither does Christine B.’s citation to Muskrat ex rel. J.M. v. Deer Creek\n\nPublic Schools, 715 F.3d 775 (10th Cir. 2013), prove more helpful to her cause.\n\nThere the parents filed suit under various statutes seeking damages for\n\n“continuing medical consequences” arising from the school district’s alleged\n\nabuse of a “timeout” room. Id. at 785. This court proceeded on the premise that\n\nIDEA could supply some remedial help to address the parents’ concerns and so,\n\nunder Padilla, subsection (l)’s exhaustion requirement did apply. But the court\n\nthen observed that the parents, through an agreement with the school, had\n\nobtained all the relief IDEA could possibly provide. See id. at 785-86. Given\n\nthis, the court held, requiring them to walk through the remaining IDEA\n\nadministrative processes — when no more relief could possibly be won under the\n\nstatute — would be “futile.” Id. at 786. In doing so, the court accepted that\n\nIDEA’s administrative exhaustion requirement is subject to a traditional futility\n\nexception. See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 327 (1988) (noting in the context of\n\n                                           8\n\fthe Education of the Handicapped Act, IDEA’s predecessor, that “parents may\n\nbypass the administrative process where exhaustion would be futile or\n\ninadequate”).\n\n      Quite unlike the parents in Muskrat, however, Christine B. never attempted\n\na futility argument in this case before the district court issued its final judgment.\n\nInstead (and again) she contended only that she had actually and successfully\n\nexhausted every administrative avenue IDEA specifies for cases like hers. To be\n\nsure, after the district court entered final judgment Christine B. sought to reopen\n\nher case so she could introduce a futility argument. But the district court could\n\nfind no justifiable reason for her failure to present the argument before final\n\njudgment and denied the motion to reopen on that basis (among others). See\n\ngenerally Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (requiring parties to show excusable neglect or the\n\nlike). Maybe the result in this case might have been different if the argument had\n\nbeen presented earlier. Certainly our dissenting colleague seems to take the view\n\nthat requiring further administrative litigation in these circumstances would be a\n\nwaste of time and effort. See Dissent at 15. But neither Christine B. nor the\n\ndissent offers any ground on which we might reverse the district court, for even\n\nnow they do not offer a colorable reason why she failed to present a futility\n\nargument before judgment or attempt to suggest how the district court’s original\n\njudgment committed plain error by failing to address such an argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      Beyond text and precedent, Christine B. appeals to policy, asserting that by\n\nfollowing the statute’s plain terms we risk “thwart[ing]” the very idea of IDEA, at\n\nleast as she conceives of it. In her view it’s simply unimaginable that Congress\n\nmight have wanted to compel a claimant to choose between accepting an early\n\nmediated resolution or foregoing that relief in hope of obtaining fuller relief\n\nthrough federal court litigation months or years later. Our dissenting colleague\n\nvoices much the same argument. The problem is that where, as here, “the terms\n\nof the statute are clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends and we simply give\n\neffect to the plain language of the statute.” United States v. Sprenger, 625 F.3d\n\n1305, 1307 (10th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation mark omitted). Indeed, it is and\n\nought to be a very rare and highly unusual thing for courts to dismiss the results\n\ndictated by Congress’s plain statutory command on the ground they are\n\nimplausible as a matter of “policy.” Yes, there’s scrivener’s error doctrine. See,\n\ne.g., U.S. Nat. Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 462\n\n(1993). But we hardly have anything like that here and neither Christine B. nor\n\nthe dissent identifies any recognized doctrine that might allow us to disregard the\n\nplain terms of IDEA’s exhaustion requirement.\n\n      Even beyond this fundamental problem lies another for there is nothing\n\nremotely implausible about the “policy” result the plain language dictates. After\n\nSmith, Congress in subsection (l) surely indicated that it does not regard IDEA as\n\nthe sole federal statutory tool available to remedy education-related wrongs. But,\n\n                                          10\n\fas we’ve seen, in responding to Smith Congress also expressly chose to link IDEA\n\nclaims to other federal claims through 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)’s exhaustion\n\nrequirement. Christine B. and the dissent may wish this linkage didn’t exist and\n\nwe can imagine a rational Congress choosing to sever it. But neither do we find it\n\nhard to imagine a rational Congress choosing to do just what the Supreme Court\n\nin Smith thought Congress had done, funneling all education-related federal\n\nlawsuits into IDEA exclusively. And we can easily imagine a rational Congress\n\ndoing exactly what it did after Smith, taking one of many possible intermediate\n\npositions by requiring those who wish to forego a mediated IDEA settlement to\n\nexhaust (or prove futile) all of the administrative grievance processes available to\n\nthem before bringing any related federal lawsuit. While we readily admit many\n\ndifferent plausible, indeed respectable, policy choices could be made in this field,\n\nno one has given us any reason to think the policy decision embodied in the text\n\nadopted by Congress is anything less than those things as well. And it’s simply\n\nnot our place to displace Congress’s plain and plainly rational directions with our\n\nown.\n\n       Indeed, like most legislation, we don’t doubt that IDEA sought to balance a\n\nnumber of competing purposes in a whole array of areas (like seeking to help\n\nchildren and respect local educational authorities) and it’s hardly beyond the pale\n\nto think it did just that here (by allowing for litigation in extreme cases and\n\nencouraging settlement or administrative resolution in most). To permit a litigant\n\n                                          11\n\fto invoke the supposedly “‘plain purpose[s]’ of legislation at the expense of the\n\nterms of the statute itself” risks doing no more “in the end [than] prevent[ing] the\n\neffectuation of congressional intent” by replacing Congress’s compromise with\n\nanother of our own devise. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v.\n\nDimension Fin. Corp., 474 U.S. 361, 373-74 (1986); see also In re Dawes, 652\n\nF.3d 1236, 1243 (10th Cir. 2011) (“[D]eparting from a precise statutory text may\n\ndo no more than disturb a carefully wrought legislative compromise.” (internal\n\nquotation mark omitted)).\n\n      Failing all else, Christine B. suggests we should at least remand this case\n\nfor further factual development (read: discovery) on the exhaustion question. She\n\nsays the district court acted too quickly in dismissing the case in response to the\n\ndefendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings and committed error when it\n\ndeclined to reopen the case in response to her post-judgment motions seeking time\n\nfor further factual development. But like the district court, we see no profit in\n\nthis course because it’s clear as a matter of law that she cannot prove exhaustion\n\ngiven the pleadings she filed in the proceedings below and the arguments she\n\npresented when challenged and given a full and fair chance to respond. And it’s\n\nsettled law in this circuit, as elsewhere, that the question whether a party\n\nexhausted administrative remedies may be decided on a motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings and incorporated materials where the failure to exhaust is clear as a\n\nmatter of law. See Allen v. Zavaras, 568 F.3d 1197, 1202 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      In the end, this is one of those cases where bad argument risks bad law.\n\nIt’s possible Christine B. could have won this case without depending on an\n\nargument that calls on this court to mangle plain statutory terms. Maybe\n\nChristine B. could have argued that subsection (l) was inapplicable to her claims.\n\nMaybe she could have argued the futility of further exhaustion. But any potential\n\nargument along lines like those was abandoned long ago. And what argument\n\nthat’s left runs headlong into an unambiguous textual command, a command that\n\nyields an entirely plausible policy result, a result that may not be Christine B.’s\n\nfirst choice or the dissent’s but that no one can (or has even tried to) call absurd\n\nor somehow otherwise unworthy of our respect. And it cannot be the case that the\n\nfailure of one party in one case to press potentially winning arguments should\n\ninduce this or any court to rewrite Congress’s clear statutory directions for all\n\ncases to come.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fNo. 14-2139, A.F. v. Espanola Public Schools, et al.\n\nBRISCOE, Chief Judge, dissenting.\n\n      In this case of first impression, the majority misreads 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)\n\nto require a litigant, such as plaintiff A.F., to forgo any resolution of her claim\n\nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in order to preserve\n\nthe ability to seek remedies in federal court under acts other than the IDEA.\n\nMore specifically, a claimant under the IDEA must now, in order to later be able\n\nto file suit in federal court under other related statutes, refuse to settle her IDEA\n\nclaim during the preliminary meeting required by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(1)(B) or\n\nthe mediation process described in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e), and must also lose in\n\nboth the due process hearing outlined in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(1)(A) and the\n\nsubsequent administrative appeal outlined in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(g). This was\n\nclearly not the intent of Congress and, ironically enough, harms the interests of\n\nthe children that IDEA was intended to protect. As a result, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                           I\n\n                                Factual background\n\n      The following facts are derived from A.F.’s complaint. A.F., born on June\n\n2, 1996, suffers from a learning disorder that she identifies as dyslexia. From the\n\ntime she was old enough to attend school until the summer of 2012, A.F. attended\n\nthe Espanola Public Schools (EPS). When she was in elementary school, A.F.\n\nparticipated in EPS’s Title I program (focused on educationally at-risk students),\n\nbut nevertheless made only minimal progress in reading and spelling. In middle\n\fschool, A.F. continued to struggle academically, particularly with language arts,\n\nmath, and life science. Indeed, A.F. failed half of her classes during both her\n\nseventh and eighth grade years.\n\n      At the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year, A.F., though old enough to\n\nattend high school, was retained by EPS in the eighth grade and directed to attend\n\nmiddle school. At the end of the first semester of the 2010-2011 school year, EPS\n\nreconsidered its decision, despite A.F. having failed two courses during the fall\n\nsemester, and directed her to attend Espanola Valley High School (EVHS) as a\n\nninth-grader during the spring semester. When A.F. began attending EVHS, she\n\nand her mother were instructed by EPS that she would attend a segregated credit\n\nrecovery class during the morning and would then need to be picked up at noon\n\neach day. When A.F.’s mother objected, EPS agreed to allow A.F. to stay in the\n\nEVHS library until she could ride the bus home at the end of the school day.\n\nDuring the time that A.F. spent in the EVHS library, she was not provided with\n\ninstruction or attention from school staff. At some point during the spring\n\nsemester of 2011, EPS changed A.F.’s afternoon schedule and placed her in\n\nadditional classes. A.F., however, ultimately failed all but one of those classes.\n\n      A.F. continued to attend EVHS during the 2011-2012 school year.\n\nAlthough A.F.’s mother asked EPS to evaluate and help A.F., EPS advised her\n\nthat it could be between three and six months before A.F. would be evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fDuring the fall semester of 2011, A.F. failed four of six classes and received Ds\n\nin the other two classes.\n\n      In the summer of 2012, A.F., due to the difficulties she encountered with\n\nEPS, transferred to a private school named Victory Faith Christian Academy.\n\n                            A.F.’s due process complaint\n\n      On February 10, 2012, while she was still attending EVHS, A.F. filed with\n\nthe New Mexico Public Education Department (NMPED) a special education due\n\nprocess hearing complaint. The complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that EPS\n\n“ha[d] not evaluated or identified [A.F.] under either the IDEA or Section 504 of\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act.” App. at 73. The complaint further alleged that EPS\n\nviolated the IDEA by failing to “timely and comprehensively evaluate [A.F.] in\n\nall areas of suspected disability and need from August 2009 to the present,”\n\n“failing to identify [A.F.] as eligible for special education and related services\n\nunder the IDEA from August 2009 to the present,” “failing to develop and\n\nimplement an IEP [(individualized education program)] for [A.F.] from August\n\n2009 to the present,” and “failing to provide [A.F.’s mother] with information\n\nrequired in connection with her evaluation requests, including prior written notice\n\nand IDEA procedural safeguards, since the 2008 to 2009 school year.” Id. at 74.\n\nThe complaint sought “prospective relief” in the form of “an order requiring the\n\n[EPS]” to (1) “identify [A.F.] as a student eligible for special education,” (2)\n\n“develop an interim IEP for [A.F.],” (3) “obtain comprehensive evaluation(s) of\n\n\n                                           3\n\f[A.F.] . . . in all areas of need including academic development, emotional\n\nfunctioning and attentional issues,” (4) “retain an independent Facilitator to\n\nfacilitate development of an IEP for [A.F.] and to include independent evaluators\n\nand [A.F.’s] attorney in the FIEP [(final individualized education program)] at\n\n[EPS] expense,” and (5) provide A.F. with “compensatory education and related\n\nservices to address areas of need identified by the evaluations and credit\n\nrecovery.” Id.\n\n      On May 16, 2012, A.F. and EPS resolved the due process hearing complaint\n\nby entering into a written mediation agreement. Contrary to the majority’s\n\ninterpretation of the mediation agreement, it purported to “resolve all claims\n\nunder the [IDEA].” Id. at 76. As part of the mediation agreement, EPS agreed to\n\n“identify [A.F.] as a child with Specific Learning Disabilities in the areas of\n\nreading comprehension, written expression, and math calculation,” id., and “to\n\nmake [a] compensatory education program . . . available to [A.F.] for so long as\n\n[she] enrolled in Victory Faith and resid[ed] within the geographical boundaries\n\nof the [EPS],” id. at 77. EPS also agreed to pay a portion of the costs associated\n\nwith A.F. attending Victory Faith, and to provide her with transportation to and\n\nfrom Victory Faith.\n\n      On May 18, 2012, two days after the parties entered in the mediation\n\nagreement, A.F. filed a motion with the NMPED to dismiss her due process\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fhearing complaint with prejudice. The motion was granted by the NMPED that\n\nsame day.\n\n                            The federal court proceedings\n\n      On August 23, 2012, A.F., by and through her parent and next friend,\n\nChristine B., filed suit against defendants in the First Judicial District Court for\n\nthe County of Santa Fe, New Mexico, asserting “causes of action for (1) violation\n\nof federal disability discrimination laws, pursuant to Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act (‘Section 504’) and the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(‘ADA’), as actionable pursuant to such Acts and pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983\n\nand 1988, and (2) violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights to procedural\n\nDue Process, as actionable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.” Id. at 21.\n\n      A.F.’s combined Section 504 and ADA claim (the first cause of action in\n\nher complaint) alleged that EPS discriminated against her on the basis of her\n\nlearning disability and was deliberately indifferent to federal disability laws\n\nrequiring it to take her disability into account in the delivery of her education, “as\n\nevidenced by [its] failure to accommodate her need for identification, evaluation,\n\nand assistance as a student with learning disabilities affecting major areas of her\n\nlife.” Id. at 31. The claim further alleged that, “[a]s a direct and proximate result\n\nof [EPS’s] violations of federal disability laws, A.F. suffered loss of educational\n\nopportunities, emotional distress and mental anguish, damage to her self-esteem,\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fand potentially irremediable developmental delays, entitling A.F. to compensatory\n\ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial.” Id.\n\n      A.F.’s § 1983 due process claim (the second cause of action in her\n\ncomplaint) alleged that A.F. had “a protected liberty and property interest in her\n\npublic school education and the wide array of benefits and services that should\n\nhave been made available to her, including an interest in identification,\n\nevaluation, and assistance as a child with learning disabilities.” Id. at 32. The\n\nclaim in turn alleged that EPS personnel “personally participated as [EPS]\n\npolicymakers in the decisions to deny [her] some or all of these benefits and\n\nservices and caused the violations to occur.” Id. The claim alleged several\n\nalternative theories of liability, including “supervisory liability,” id., “failure of\n\n[EPS] to train [its] employees,” id., and EPS’s “establish[ment] [of] a de facto\n\ncourse of conduct of denying disabled students the rights and liberty and property\n\ninterests to which they were entitled,” id. at 33. The claim further alleged that\n\nEPS’s “actions and deliberate indifference denied A.F. the procedural protections\n\nof federal and state law by denying her a public education and special education\n\non an arbitrary and capricious basis,” and that “[n]o post-deprivation hearing was\n\nadequate to remedy these violations of procedural Due Process.” Id. at 34.\n\nLastly, the claim alleged that, “[a]s a direct and proximate result of [EPS’s]\n\nconduct, A.F. suffered emotional distress and mental anguish, damage to her self-\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\festeem, and potentially irremediable developmental delays, entitling A.F. to\n\ncompensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.” Id. at 35.\n\n      On November 13, 2012, defendants removed the complaint to federal\n\ndistrict court, asserting jurisdiction based on the existence of a federal question\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Id. at 16-18.\n\n      On April 8, 2013, defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings,\n\narguing, in pertinent part, that A.F. had failed to exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies as required by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). Attached to defendants’ motion\n\nwere copies of the due process hearing complaint that A.F. filed with the\n\nNMPED, the mediation agreement between A.F. and EPS settling that complaint,\n\nand A.F.’s motion to dismiss her due process hearing complaint with prejudice.\n\n      On December 6, 2013, the district court issued a memorandum opinion and\n\norder granting defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. In doing so, the\n\ndistrict court first concluded that “[a]ll of [A.F.]’s claims require[d] exhaustion,\n\nbecause the relief she s[ought] [wa]s also available under the IDEA.” Id. at 247.\n\n“The entirety of [A.F.]’s Complaint,” the district court noted, “center[ed] on the\n\ndispute over [EPS’s] efforts to accommodate A.F.’s educational needs,” and her\n\n“discrimination and Section 1983 claims [we]re part and parcel of her\n\neducationally based grievance.” Id. at 249. The district court in turn\n\n“determine[d] that the Mediation Agreement . . . d[id] not satisfy [A.F.]’s\n\nobligation to exhaust her administrative remedies under the IDEA.” Id. More\n\n                                           7\n\fspecifically, the district court concluded that “the IDEA’s exhaustion requirement\n\n. . . is not satisfied when parties enter into a mediated settlement agreement,” and\n\nthat, instead, “there must be, at the very least, a state-level impartial due process\n\nhearing before the aggrieved party can file a civil action in federal court.” Id. at\n\n251. Although the district court acknowledged that “[e]xhaustion is not required\n\nwhere (1) it would be futile, (2) it would fail to provide adequate relief, or (3) an\n\nagency has adopted a policy or pursued a practice of general applicability that is\n\ncontrary to the law,” it noted that A.F. had failed to “address whether any of\n\nthe[se] . . . exceptions to the exhaustion requirement appl[ied] to [her] case.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       On January 2, 2014, A.F. filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment. Id.\n\nat 254. In that motion, A.F. conceded that she was required under the IDEA to\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies, but she argued that the dismissal of her due\n\nprocess hearing complaint, pursuant to the mediation agreement, constituted\n\nexhaustion. A.F. also argued “that the mediated settlement of [her] educational\n\nrelief claims ma[d]e[] further exhaustion of administrative remedies futile.” Id. at\n\n266.\n\n       On July 8, 2014, the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order\n\ndenying A.F.’s motion to alter or amend judgment. The district court reaffirmed\n\nits conclusion that “a mediated settlement agreement does not satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fexhaustion requirement of 1415(l).” Id. at 362. The district court also rejected\n\nA.F.’s assertion that exhaustion would be futile.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                Standard of review\n\n      “We review a district court’s grant of a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings de novo, using the same standard that applies to a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion.” Park Univ. Enters. v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, PA, 442 F.3d 1239,\n\n1244 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\n               What does § 1415(l) require in terms of exhaustion?\n\n      IDEA’s administrative exhaustion provision provides as follows:\n\n      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the\n      rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the\n      Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C.A. § 12101 et\n      seq.], title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.A. § 791 et\n      seq.], or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with\n      disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under such\n      laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter, the\n      procedures under subsections (f) and (g) shall be exhausted to the\n      same extent as would be required had the action been brought under\n      this subchapter.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(l) (emphasis added).\n\n      “Our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language\n\nat issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular\n\ndispute in the case.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). “Our\n\ninquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory\n\nscheme is coherent and consistent.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). “The\n\n                                         9\n\fplainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the\n\nlanguage itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the\n\nbroader context of the statute as a whole.” Id. at 341.\n\n      The majority in this case concludes that the above-highlighted language of\n\n§ 1415(l) unambiguously requires a litigant, such as A.F., to “qualify under\n\nsubsection [1415](i) as a party ‘aggrieved by the findings and decision’ of\n\nadministrative trial and appellate authorities.” Maj. Op. at 7. In other words, the\n\nmajority interprets the highlighted language as unambiguously requiring a\n\nlitigant, in order to proceed in federal court under a statute other than IDEA, to\n\nforgo resolution of her claim by way of a preliminary meeting or mediation and to\n\nlose at both the administrative trial and appellate levels.\n\n      I submit, however, that the highlighted language is “‘capable of being\n\nunderstood’” in another, and indeed more reasonable, “‘way[].’” Chickasaw\n\nNation v. United States, 534 U.S. 84, 90 (2001) (quoting Webster’s Ninth New\n\nCollegiate Dictionary 77 (1985)). In order to explain this alternative\n\ninterpretation, it is necessary to review how an IDEA complaint is filed and\n\nresolved, including a close examination of the procedures that Congress made\n\navailable under §§ 1415(f) and (g).\n\n      Section 1415(a) requires “[a]ny State educational agency, State agency, or\n\nlocal educational agency that receives assistance under this subchapter” to\n\n“establish and maintain” a variety of procedures “to ensure that children with\n\n\n                                          10\n\fdisabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to\n\nthe provision of a free appropriate public education by such agencies.” 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(a). Of relevance here is “[a]n opportunity . . . to present a complaint.” Id.\n\n§ 1415(b)(6).\n\n      The “opportunity . . . to present a complaint” referred to in § 1415(b)(6) is\n\nfleshed out in greater detail in §§ 1415(f) and (g). To begin with, the process\n\nanticipates that “parents” may file a complaint and in turn be afforded “an\n\nopportunity for an impartial due process hearing, which shall be conducted by the\n\nState educational agency or by the local educational agency, as determined by\n\nState law or by the State educational agency.” Id. § 1415(f)(1)(A). Prior to a due\n\nprocess hearing being conducted, however, and within fifteen days of the receipt\n\nof the complaint, “the local educational agency” must “convene a [preliminary]\n\nmeeting with the parents and the relevant member or members of the IEP Team\n\nwho have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the complaint.” Id. §\n\n1415(f)(1)(B)(i). The intended purpose of this “preliminary meeting” is to allow\n\nthe “the parents of the child [to] discuss their complaint, and the facts that form\n\nthe basis of the complaint,” and to afford “the local educational agency . . . the\n\nopportunity to resolve the complaint.” Id.\n\n      The only exception to this preliminary meeting requirement is if “the\n\nparents and the local educational agency agree in writing to waive such meeting,\n\nor agree to use the mediation process described in subsection (e).” Id. The\n\n\n                                          11\n\fopportunity for mediation, which is detailed in § 1415(e), is intended “to allow\n\nparties to disputes involving any matter . . . to resolve such disputes through a\n\nmediation process.” Id. § 1415(e). Notably, this process anticipates that\n\n“complaint[s]” may be “resolve[d]” through the mediation process by way of “a\n\nlegally binding [written] agreement.” Id. § 1415(e)(2)(F).\n\n      “If the local educational agency has not resolved the complaint to the\n\nsatisfaction of the parents within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint” (by way\n\nof the preliminary meeting or mediation), “the due process hearing may occur.”\n\nId. § 1415(f)(1)(B)(ii). The outcome of such a hearing is “a decision made by a\n\nhearing officer . . . on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether\n\nthe child received a free appropriate public education.” Id. § 1415(f)(3)(E).\n\n      Subsection (g) affords, in certain circumstances, a right of administrative\n\nappeal. Specifically, “[i]f the hearing required by subsection (f) is conducted by\n\na local educational agency, any party aggrieved by the findings and decision\n\nrendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decisions to the State\n\neducational agency.” Id. § 1415(g)(1). “The State educational agency,” in turn,\n\nis required to “conduct an impartial review of the findings and decision appealed”\n\nand “make an independent decision upon completion of such review.” Id. §\n\n1415(g)(2).\n\n      With this statutory framework in mind, I now return to the language of §\n\n1415(l) and submit that it can reasonably, and indeed should, be interpreted as\n\n\n                                          12\n\fmerely requiring a claimant to make full use of the procedures outlined in §§\n\n1415(f) and (g) to attempt to resolve her IDEA claim. Under this interpretation, a\n\nmediated resolution of an IDEA claim would be considered sufficient to\n\nconstitute exhaustion for purposes of § 1415(l). That is not only because the\n\nstatutory framework anticipates, and in fact encourages, resolution of IDEA\n\nclaims by way of mediation, but also because a mediated resolution leaves\n\nnothing to be decided at a due process hearing or in an administrative appeal.\n\n         The interpretation of § 1415(l) adopted by the majority is, in my view,\n\ninconsistent with the overall statutory framework developed by Congress. Indeed,\n\nwhy would Congress, after creating a framework that quite clearly encourages\n\nresolution of IDEA claims by various means, force a claimant to avoid resolution\n\nof her claim by mediation or preliminary meeting and lose at both the due process\n\nhearing and administrative appeal stages? Doing so would effectively render\n\nsuperfluous the mediation and preliminary meeting provisions of the statute.\n\nFurther, precisely how could a claimant ensure a loss in both the due process\n\nhearing and the administrative appeal, yet later present a viable claim in federal\n\ncourt?\n\n         The majority’s interpretation is also, in my view, inconsistent with\n\nCongress’s more specific purpose in enacting § 1415(l). Congress added this\n\nstatutory language to clarify its disagreement with the majority opinion, and to\n\neffectively codify Justice Brennan’s dissenting opinion, in Smith v. Robinson,\n\n\n                                           13\n\f468 U.S. 992 (1984). The key sentence in Justice Brennan’s dissent, for our\n\npurposes, is this:\n\n      The natural resolution of the conflict between the EHA [the\n      predecessor to the IDEA], on the one hand, and §§ 504 and 1983, on\n      the other, is to require the plaintiff with a claim covered by the EHA\n      to pursue relief through the administrative channels established by\n      that Act before seeking redress in the courts under § 504 or § 1983.\n\n468 U.S. at 1024. Nothing in this statement suggests that a plaintiff must forgo\n\nmediation and unsuccessfully pursue relief through the statute’s administrative\n\nchannels before proceeding to federal court on his or her other related claims.\n\nConsequently, it makes little sense to say that Congress intended the opposite\n\nresult in enacting § 1415(l).\n\n      Finally, the majority’s interpretation is inconsistent with the very purpose\n\nof IDEA. It forces a claimant to choose between mediating a resolution to her\n\nIDEA claim (even if the local educational agency were willing to admit and\n\ncorrect the alleged errors) and thereby obtaining some or all of the relief sought\n\nunder IDEA (in this case, for example, the creation of a compensatory education\n\nprogram, the payment of costs associated with attending another school, and\n\ntransportation to and from that school), or forgoing any relief at all and waiting\n\n(while the child ages and potentially continues to receive something other than\n\nthe requisite “free appropriate public education”) in hopes of later filing suit and\n\nobtaining relief under both IDEA and other statutes. That, I again submit, could\n\nnot have been the intent of Congress in adopting § 1415(l).\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                  The other rationales offered by the district court\n\n      The district court in this case purported to “adopt[] the First Circuit’s\n\ninterpretation of the IDEA’s exhaustion requirement” outlined in Weber v.\n\nCranston Sch. Comm., 212 F.3d 41 (1st Cir. 2000). App. at 251. According to\n\nthe district court, in that case “the First Circuit addressed the issue of what\n\nconstitutes exhaustion under the IDEA and found that mediation is insufficient.”\n\nId. at 250 (citing 212 F.3d at 53). A review of Weber, however, indicates that the\n\nFirst Circuit’s holding was not that broad. The parent/plaintiff in Weber argued\n\nthat she complied with § 1415(l)’s exhaustion requirement “through the numerous\n\nadministrative complaints that she filed” prior to initiating her civil lawsuit. 212\n\nF.3d at 53. In rejecting this argument, the First Circuit stated as follows:\n\n      Although Weber filed three CRP complaints with the Rhode Island\n      Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, two complaints\n      with the Office of Equity and Access, and participated in a mediation\n      on the issue of declassification, she never initiated the due process\n      hearing described in IDEA. IDEA’s mandate is explicit: plaintiffs\n      must exhaust IDEA’s impartial due process hearing procedures in\n      order to bring a civil action under subchapter II of IDEA or any\n      “such law[] seeking relief that is also available” under subchapter II\n      of IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).\n\nId. Thus, although the plaintiff/parent in Weber “participated in a mediation” on\n\na single issue, there is no indication that the mediation was successful, i.e., that\n\nshe actually resolved that issue (or any of the administrative complaints) by way\n\nof a written mediation agreement. Consequently, the Weber decision did not\n\naddress the question at issue in this case, i.e., whether the resolution of a due\n\n\n                                          15\n\fprocess hearing complaint by way of a written mediation agreement is sufficient\n\nto constitute exhaustion of the procedures outlined in subsections (f) and (g).\n\n       The district court also asserted that its “determination that a settlement does\n\nnot meet the exhaustion requirements [wa]s supported by the policy rationales\n\nrequiring exhaustion.” App. at 251. These policy rationales, the district court\n\nasserted, include “(1) permitting the exercise of agency discretion and expertise\n\non issues requiring these characteristics; (2) allowing the full development of\n\ntechnical issues and a factual record prior to court review; (3) preventing\n\ndeliberate disregard and circumvention of agency procedures established by\n\nCongress; and (4) avoiding unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency\n\nthe first opportunity to correct any error.” Id. at 251-52 (quoting Ass’n for Cmty.\n\nLiving v. Romer, 992 F.2d 1040, 1044 (10th Cir. 1993). And, according to the\n\ndistrict court, “allowing the settlement in this case to constitute exhaustion would\n\npermit plaintiffs to proceed with their claims without developing a factual record,\n\nallowing the educational system to exercise its expertise in resolving this conflict,\n\nor providing the parties a full opportunity to avoid excessive litigation.” Id. at\n\n252.\n\n       The district court’s analysis was wrong. To be sure, the use of a written\n\nmediation agreement eliminates the need for a due process hearing under §\n\n1415(f), and, as a result, there is no administrative record that can be reviewed in\n\nany subsequent civil action. But resolving a due process complaint by mediation\n\n\n                                          16\n\fotherwise appears to serve the purposes of IDEA, and in an arguably more\n\nefficient fashion than by way of a due process hearing and subsequent\n\nadministrative appeal. In particular, it allows the local educational agency that is\n\nthe subject of the complaint to exercise its discretion and expertise in order to\n\nimmediately correct any errors that may have occurred. Further, by preventing\n\nthe need for a due process hearing and subsequent administrative appeal, it spares\n\nresources of local and State educational agencies. And, most importantly, it best\n\nserves the interests of the child at issue by promptly resolving the pending issues.\n\n                                          III\n\n      In sum, I conclude that resolution of a due process complaint by way of a\n\nwritten mediation agreement constitutes exhaustion for purposes of § 1415(l).\n\nBecause the district court concluded otherwise, I would reverse the judgment of\n\nthe district court and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f",

Sometimes, of\n\ncourse, disputes arise over whether the school district is doing the job it’s agreed\n\nto do. This is one of those cases. Christine B., the mother of a student known in\n\nthese proceedings as A.F., contends that the school district failed to address\n\nappropriately her daughter’s disabilities in the educational program it formulated\n\nfor her.\n\n      When a dispute like this emerges, the parent and student must file an\n\nadministrative complaint with local school officials. See id. § 1415(b)(6),\n\n(f)(1)(A). Then the parties are instructed by statute to hold a “[p]reliminary\n\nmeeting” with an eye toward talking through the grievance and trying for an early\n\nresolution. Id. § 1415(f)(1)(B)(i). They can also choose to resolve their\n\ndifferences through mediation. Id. § 1415(e). But if no settlement satisfactory to\n\nboth sides comes to pass, the parties must proceed to a sort of trial, what IDEA\n\ncalls an “[i]mpartial due process hearing.” Id. § 1415(f). If the hearing still\n\ndoesn’t satisfy parent and student, an administrative appeal may follow. Id.\n\n§ 1415(g)(1). If the parent and student still remain “aggrieved by the findings\n\nand decision made” after this appeal process, they may then (and only then)\n\n“bring a civil action” in federal court. Id. § 1415(i)(2)(A). At the same time, if\n\nthe state fails to provide an appeals process, a party who is aggrieved by the\n\n                                          2\n\ffindings and decision in the subsection (f) trial-like proceeding may also proceed\n\nto court. Id. Plainly in all this, Congress sought to ensure access to courts for\n\nIDEA claims but only failing the success of the many alternative dispute\n\nopportunities it provided.\n\n      This case ended almost before it began. Christine B. filed her\n\nadministrative complaint, just as she had to. But before any hearing could be\n\nheld, she sought to mediate her dispute. And the choice proved fruitful, for in the\n\nend the parties signed a settlement agreement. Indeed, as a result of the\n\nsettlement, Christine B. asked the administrative agency to dismiss her IDEA\n\nclaims with prejudice, something the agency duly did.\n\n      But after ending her suit she sought to begin it again. Despite the\n\nsatisfactory result she received through mediation, Christine B. later took to mind\n\nthe thought she might sue — and she did. To be sure, her lawsuit didn’t seek to\n\npress a claim under IDEA, itself a tacit acknowledgment that her mediated\n\nsettlement precluded that option. Instead, she sued under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, though the\n\nallegations in her federal court complaint and those in her original IDEA\n\nadministrative complaint are nearly identical: both allege that A.F. suffers from\n\nthe same disabilities and both contend that the school district failed to take her\n\ndisabilities into account in her educational program. Agreeing with the school\n\ndistrict that Christine B. failed to exhaust available administrative remedies, the\n\n                                          3\n\fdistrict court dismissed her lawsuit and it is this result she now asks us to\n\noverturn.\n\n      There’s no doubt that it’s often possible to pursue claims under IDEA and\n\nother federal statutes seriatim just as Christine B. wishes to do. Indeed, Congress\n\nexpressly guaranteed as much, stating that IDEA’s promises and procedures don’t\n\nnecessarily extinguish one’s “rights . . . and remedies” under other federal laws\n\nlike the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). In fact, Congress\n\nadded this language to clarify its disagreement with the Supreme Court’s\n\nsuggestion in Smith v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), that a claim under IDEA\n\n(or, really, its predecessor statute, the Education of the Handicapped Act) should\n\nbe the exclusive federal statutory remedy for any education-related complaint by\n\ndisabled public school students.\n\n      But Congress didn’t stop there. After emphasizing that IDEA doesn’t\n\nalways preclude relief under laws like the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, Congress\n\nadded this caveat:\n\n      except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief\n      that is also available under [IDEA], the procedures under subsections (f)\n      and (g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the\n      action been brought under [IDEA].\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). So it is that, to bring a lawsuit under federal law that\n\n“seek[s] relief that is also available under” IDEA, you first must exhaust the\n\nprocedures set forth in subsections (f) and (g) “to the same extent as would be\n\n\n                                           4\n\frequired had the action been brought under” IDEA. And, as we’ve seen, to “bring\n\na civil action” under IDEA you must be “aggrieved by the findings and decision\n\nmade” after the administrative appeals process (or trial process if no appeal\n\nprocess is provided). Id. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n      It’s here where Christine B. faces a problem, just as the district court\n\nrecognized. She accepts that her current lawsuit “seek[s] relief that is also\n\navailable under” IDEA and thus triggers subsection (l)’s exhaustion requirement.\n\nTo be sure, her lawsuit seeks damages — a remedy that’s “ordinarily unavailable\n\nin administrative [IDEA] hearings.” Cudjoe v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 12, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778496\"><a href=\"/opinion/778496/brenda-cudjoe-adam-scottie-carrington-a-minor-by-and-through-his-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1066 (10th Cir. 2002). But some time ago this court held that the\n\n“dispositive question” when assessing the applicability of subsection (l)’s\n\nexhaustion requirement isn’t whether the plaintiff seeks damages or some other\n\nparticular remedy, but “whether the plaintiff has alleged injuries that could be\n\nredressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administrative procedures and remedies.”\n\nPadilla ex rel. Padilla v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1274 (10th Cir. 2000)\n\n(emphasis added). Neither does Christine B. ask us to revisit Padilla or otherwise\n\ndispute that the injuries she seeks to redress in her lawsuit are indeed capable of\n\nbeing redressed to some degree by IDEA’s administrative procedures. And with\n\nthat, with an admission of subsection (l)’s applicability, it’s very hard to see how\n\nshe can satisfy it. Subsection (l) required her to exhaust the procedures set forth\n\nin subsections (f) and (g) to the same extent necessary to bring a civil action\n\n                                          5\n\funder IDEA itself. And to bring such an action she must be able to show that\n\nshe’s “aggrieved by the findings and decision” of the administrative trial\n\nauthorities described in subsection (f) or the administrative appellate authorities\n\ndescribed in subsection (g). Something she manifestly is not.\n\n      Coming at the point from a different angle, Christine B.’s problem is that\n\nthere’s only one exhaustion rule for IDEA claims and other federal claims seeking\n\nrelief also available under IDEA. It’s clear Christine B. cannot bring an IDEA\n\nlawsuit in federal court after choosing to settle her IDEA claims and agreeing to\n\ntheir dismissal with prejudice. She even tacitly concedes this by declining any\n\nattempt to raise them here. And from this it follows ineluctably that an ADA or\n\nRehabilitation Act or § 1983 lawsuit seeking the same relief is also barred.\n\n      Christine B. responds this way. She notes that subsection (f) permits the\n\nparties to opt out of the trial-like administrative process and pursue mediation\n\nunder subsection (e). See id. § 1415(f)(1)(B)(i). So by mediating her IDEA claim\n\nunder subsection (e), she says, she necessarily satisfied the procedures described\n\nin subsection (f). And given that no appeal is necessary or even available after a\n\nmediated settlement, subsection (g) is beside the point. It’s in this way, she\n\nargues, that she exhausted the administrative procedures available to her. Our\n\ndissenting colleague seems to adopt this same line of reasoning too.\n\n      The problem is this vision of exhaustion just isn’t the one embodied in the\n\nplain text of the statute. If subsection (l) said that to bring a federal lawsuit under\n\n                                           6\n\fthe ADA or Rehabilitation Act or Section 1983 you merely had to “satisfy the\n\nadministrative procedures under subsection (f),” we might be able to say that,\n\nbecause subsection (f) references subsection (e) and its provision of mediation as\n\nan alternative means of dispute resolution, Christine B. is free and clear to pursue\n\nher lawsuit. But that’s not what subsection (l) says. It says that to bring a civil\n\naction under federal law seeking the same relief IDEA supplies, you must exhaust\n\nthe procedures in subsections (f) and (g) “to the same extent” as you must to\n\nbring a civil action under IDEA itself. And to earn the right to bring a civil\n\naction under IDEA, it’s just an implacable fact that you must qualify under\n\nsubsection (i) as a party “aggrieved by the findings and decision” of\n\nadministrative trial or appellate authorities. And neither Christine B. nor the\n\ndissent even attempts to suggest she qualifies as that.\n\n      Without statutory text to help her, Christine B. urges us to examine\n\nprecedent. And it’s true enough that otherwise unlikely statutory interpretations\n\nsometimes look more attractive when backed by the force of precedent we’re\n\nobliged to obey. But that’s just not the case here either. Christine B. directs us\n\nfirst to Ellenberg ex rel. S.E. v. New Mexico Military Institute, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168892\"><a href=\"/opinion/168892/ellenberg-v-nm-military-inst/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(10th Cir. 2007). But Ellenberg held that subsection (l)’s exhaustion requirement\n\ndidn’t apply to the plaintiff’s federal claims there precisely because IDEA could\n\n“offer[] no relief” for the particular wrongs the plaintiff asserted. Id. at 1280-81.\n\nHere again and by contrast, Christine B. accepts that subsection (l)’s exhaustion\n\n                                           7\n\frequirements apply to all of her federal claims and argues only that she’s satisfied\n\nthose requirements — an argument that, as we’ve seen, the statutory text just\n\ncan’t bear. Had she contested the applicability of subsection (l) to her case, or\n\nperhaps asked us to revisit Padilla’s expansive view of subsection (l)’s reach, we\n\nmight have had a different case. Indeed, there are notes in the dissent that could\n\nbe read to suggest arguments along just those lines. But Christine B. has made no\n\nsuch argument for herself either in the district court or this one.\n\n      Neither does Christine B.’s citation to Muskrat ex rel. J.M. v. Deer Creek\n\nPublic Schools, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2013), prove more helpful to her cause.\n\nThere the parents filed suit under various statutes seeking damages for\n\n“continuing medical consequences” arising from the school district’s alleged\n\nabuse of a “timeout” room. Id. at 785. This court proceeded on the premise that\n\nIDEA could supply some remedial help to address the parents’ concerns and so,\n\nunder Padilla, subsection (l)’s exhaustion requirement did apply. But the court\n\nthen observed that the parents, through an agreement with the school, had\n\nobtained all the relief IDEA could possibly provide. See id. at 785-86. Given\n\nthis, the court held, requiring them to walk through the remaining IDEA\n\nadministrative processes — when no more relief could possibly be won under the\n\nstatute — would be “futile.” Id. at 786. In doing so, the court accepted that\n\nIDEA’s administrative exhaustion requirement is subject to a traditional futility\n\nexception. See Honig v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111982\"><a href=\"/opinion/111982/honig-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (1988) (noting in the context of\n\n                                           8\n\fthe Education of the Handicapped Act, IDEA’s predecessor, that “parents may\n\nbypass the administrative process where exhaustion would be futile or\n\ninadequate”).\n\n      Quite unlike the parents in Muskrat, however, Christine B. never attempted\n\na futility argument in this case before the district court issued its final judgment.\n\nInstead (and again) she contended only that she had actually and successfully\n\nexhausted every administrative avenue IDEA specifies for cases like hers. To be\n\nsure, after the district court entered final judgment Christine B. sought to reopen\n\nher case so she could introduce a futility argument. But the district court could\n\nfind no justifiable reason for her failure to present the argument before final\n\njudgment and denied the motion to reopen on that basis (among others). See\n\ngenerally Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (requiring parties to show excusable neglect or the\n\nlike). Maybe the result in this case might have been different if the argument had\n\nbeen presented earlier. Certainly our dissenting colleague seems to take the view\n\nthat requiring further administrative litigation in these circumstances would be a\n\nwaste of time and effort. See Dissent at 15. But neither Christine B. nor the\n\ndissent offers any ground on which we might reverse the district court, for even\n\nnow they do not offer a colorable reason why she failed to present a futility\n\nargument before judgment or attempt to suggest how the district court’s original\n\njudgment committed plain error by failing to address such an argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      Beyond text and precedent, Christine B. appeals to policy, asserting that by\n\nfollowing the statute’s plain terms we risk “thwart[ing]” the very idea of IDEA, at\n\nleast as she conceives of it. In her view it’s simply unimaginable that Congress\n\nmight have wanted to compel a claimant to choose between accepting an early\n\nmediated resolution or foregoing that relief in hope of obtaining fuller relief\n\nthrough federal court litigation months or years later. Our dissenting colleague\n\nvoices much the same argument. The problem is that where, as here, “the terms\n\nof the statute are clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends and we simply give\n\neffect to the plain language of the statute.” United States v. Sprenger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179618\"><a href=\"/opinion/179618/united-states-v-sprenger/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1307 (10th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation mark omitted). Indeed, it is and\n\nought to be a very rare and highly unusual thing for courts to dismiss the results\n\ndictated by Congress’s plain statutory command on the ground they are\n\nimplausible as a matter of “policy.” Yes, there’s scrivener’s error doctrine. See,\n\ne.g., U.S. Nat. Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112877\"><a href=\"/opinion/112877/united-states-nat-bank-of-ore-v-independent-ins-agents-of-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462\n\n(1993). But we hardly have anything like that here and neither Christine B. nor\n\nthe dissent identifies any recognized doctrine that might allow us to disregard the\n\nplain terms of IDEA’s exhaustion requirement.\n\n      Even beyond this fundamental problem lies another for there is nothing\n\nremotely implausible about the “policy” result the plain language dictates. After\n\nSmith, Congress in subsection (l) surely indicated that it does not regard IDEA as\n\nthe sole federal statutory tool available to remedy education-related wrongs. But,\n\n                                          10\n\fas we’ve seen, in responding to Smith Congress also expressly chose to link IDEA\n\nclaims to other federal claims through 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)’s exhaustion\n\nrequirement. Christine B. and the dissent may wish this linkage didn’t exist and\n\nwe can imagine a rational Congress choosing to sever it. But neither do we find it\n\nhard to imagine a rational Congress choosing to do just what the Supreme Court\n\nin Smith thought Congress had done, funneling all education-related federal\n\nlawsuits into IDEA exclusively. And we can easily imagine a rational Congress\n\ndoing exactly what it did after Smith, taking one of many possible intermediate\n\npositions by requiring those who wish to forego a mediated IDEA settlement to\n\nexhaust (or prove futile) all of the administrative grievance processes available to\n\nthem before bringing any related federal lawsuit. While we readily admit many\n\ndifferent plausible, indeed respectable, policy choices could be made in this field,\n\nno one has given us any reason to think the policy decision embodied in the text\n\nadopted by Congress is anything less than those things as well. And it’s simply\n\nnot our place to displace Congress’s plain and plainly rational directions with our\n\nown.\n\n       Indeed, like most legislation, we don’t doubt that IDEA sought to balance a\n\nnumber of competing purposes in a whole array of areas (like seeking to help\n\nchildren and respect local educational authorities) and it’s hardly beyond the pale\n\nto think it did just that here (by allowing for litigation in extreme cases and\n\nencouraging settlement or administrative resolution in most). To permit a litigant\n\n                                          11\n\fto invoke the supposedly “‘plain purpose[s]’ of legislation at the expense of the\n\nterms of the statute itself” risks doing no more “in the end [than] prevent[ing] the\n\neffectuation of congressional intent” by replacing Congress’s compromise with\n\nanother of our own devise.

She\n\nsays the district court acted too quickly in dismissing the case in response to the\n\ndefendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings and committed error when it\n\ndeclined to reopen the case in response to her post-judgment motions seeking time\n\nfor further factual development.

And it’s\n\nsettled law in this circuit, as elsewhere, that the question whether a party\n\nexhausted administrative remedies may be decided on a motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings and incorporated materials where the failure to exhaust is clear as a\n\nmatter of law.

Espanola Public Schools, et al.\n\nBRISCOE, Chief Judge, dissenting.\n\n      In this case of first impression, the majority misreads 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)\n\nto require a litigant, such as plaintiff A.F., to forgo any resolution of her claim\n\nunder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in order to preserve\n\nthe ability to seek remedies in federal court under acts other than the IDEA.\n\nMore specifically, a claimant under the IDEA must now, in order to later be able\n\nto file suit in federal court under other related statutes, refuse to settle her IDEA\n\nclaim during the preliminary meeting required by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(1)(B) or\n\nthe mediation process described in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e), and must also lose in\n\nboth the due process hearing outlined in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(1)(A) and the\n\nsubsequent administrative appeal outlined in 20 U.S.C. § 1415(g). This was\n\nclearly not the intent of Congress and, ironically enough, harms the interests of\n\nthe children that IDEA was intended to protect. As a result, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                           I\n\n                                Factual background\n\n      The following facts are derived from A.F.’s complaint. A.F., born on June\n\n2, 1996, suffers from a learning disorder that she identifies as dyslexia. From the\n\ntime she was old enough to attend school until the summer of 2012, A.F. attended\n\nthe Espanola Public Schools (EPS). When she was in elementary school, A.F.\n\nparticipated in EPS’s Title I program (focused on educationally at-risk students),\n\nbut nevertheless made only minimal progress in reading and spelling. In middle\n\fschool, A.F. continued to struggle academically, particularly with language arts,\n\nmath, and life science. Indeed, A.F. failed half of her classes during both her\n\nseventh and eighth grade years.\n\n      At the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year, A.F., though old enough to\n\nattend high school, was retained by EPS in the eighth grade and directed to attend\n\nmiddle school. At the end of the first semester of the 2010-2011 school year, EPS\n\nreconsidered its decision, despite A.F. having failed two courses during the fall\n\nsemester, and directed her to attend Espanola Valley High School (EVHS) as a\n\nninth-grader during the spring semester. When A.F. began attending EVHS, she\n\nand her mother were instructed by EPS that she would attend a segregated credit\n\nrecovery class during the morning and would then need to be picked up at noon\n\neach day. When A.F.’s mother objected, EPS agreed to allow A.F. to stay in the\n\nEVHS library until she could ride the bus home at the end of the school day.\n\nDuring the time that A.F. spent in the EVHS library, she was not provided with\n\ninstruction or attention from school staff. At some point during the spring\n\nsemester of 2011, EPS changed A.F.’s afternoon schedule and placed her in\n\nadditional classes. A.F., however, ultimately failed all but one of those classes.\n\n      A.F. continued to attend EVHS during the 2011-2012 school year.\n\nAlthough A.F.’s mother asked EPS to evaluate and help A.F., EPS advised her\n\nthat it could be between three and six months before A.F. would be evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fDuring the fall semester of 2011, A.F. failed four of six classes and received Ds\n\nin the other two classes.\n\n      In the summer of 2012, A.F., due to the difficulties she encountered with\n\nEPS, transferred to a private school named Victory Faith Christian Academy.\n\n                            A.F.’s due process complaint\n\n      On February 10, 2012, while she was still attending EVHS, A.F. filed with\n\nthe New Mexico Public Education Department (NMPED) a special education due\n\nprocess hearing complaint. The complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that EPS\n\n“ha[d] not evaluated or identified [A.F.] under either the IDEA or Section 504 of\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act.” App. at 73. The complaint further alleged that EPS\n\nviolated the IDEA by failing to “timely and comprehensively evaluate [A.F.] in\n\nall areas of suspected disability and need from August 2009 to the present,”\n\n“failing to identify [A.F.] as eligible for special education and related services\n\nunder the IDEA from August 2009 to the present,” “failing to develop and\n\nimplement an IEP [(individualized education program)] for [A.F.] from August\n\n2009 to the present,” and “failing to provide [A.F.’s mother] with information\n\nrequired in connection with her evaluation requests, including prior written notice\n\nand IDEA procedural safeguards, since the 2008 to 2009 school year.” Id. at 74.\n\nThe complaint sought “prospective relief” in the form of “an order requiring the\n\n[EPS]” to (1) “identify [A.F.] as a student eligible for special education,” (2)\n\n“develop an interim IEP for [A.F.],” (3) “obtain comprehensive evaluation(s) of\n\n\n                                           3\n\f[A.F.] . . . in all areas of need including academic development, emotional\n\nfunctioning and attentional issues,” (4) “retain an independent Facilitator to\n\nfacilitate development of an IEP for [A.F.] and to include independent evaluators\n\nand [A.F.’s] attorney in the FIEP [(final individualized education program)] at\n\n[EPS] expense,” and (5) provide A.F. with “compensatory education and related\n\nservices to address areas of need identified by the evaluations and credit\n\nrecovery.” Id.\n\n      On May 16, 2012, A.F. and EPS resolved the due process hearing complaint\n\nby entering into a written mediation agreement. Contrary to the majority’s\n\ninterpretation of the mediation agreement, it purported to “resolve all claims\n\nunder the [IDEA].” Id. at 76. As part of the mediation agreement, EPS agreed to\n\n“identify [A.F.] as a child with Specific Learning Disabilities in the areas of\n\nreading comprehension, written expression, and math calculation,” id., and “to\n\nmake [a] compensatory education program . . . available to [A.F.] for so long as\n\n[she] enrolled in Victory Faith and resid[ed] within the geographical boundaries\n\nof the [EPS],” id. at 77. EPS also agreed to pay a portion of the costs associated\n\nwith A.F. attending Victory Faith, and to provide her with transportation to and\n\nfrom Victory Faith.\n\n      On May 18, 2012, two days after the parties entered in the mediation\n\nagreement, A.F. filed a motion with the NMPED to dismiss her due process\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fhearing complaint with prejudice. The motion was granted by the NMPED that\n\nsame day.\n\n                            The federal court proceedings\n\n      On August 23, 2012, A.F., by and through her parent and next friend,\n\nChristine B., filed suit against defendants in the First Judicial District Court for\n\nthe County of Santa Fe, New Mexico, asserting “causes of action for (1) violation\n\nof federal disability discrimination laws, pursuant to Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act (‘Section 504’) and the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(‘ADA’), as actionable pursuant to such Acts and pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983\n\nand 1988, and (2) violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights to procedural\n\nDue Process, as actionable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.” Id. at 21.\n\n      A.F.’s combined Section 504 and ADA claim (the first cause of action in\n\nher complaint) alleged that EPS discriminated against her on the basis of her\n\nlearning disability and was deliberately indifferent to federal disability laws\n\nrequiring it to take her disability into account in the delivery of her education, “as\n\nevidenced by [its] failure to accommodate her need for identification, evaluation,\n\nand assistance as a student with learning disabilities affecting major areas of her\n\nlife.” Id. at 31. The claim further alleged that, “[a]s a direct and proximate result\n\nof [EPS’s] violations of federal disability laws, A.F. suffered loss of educational\n\nopportunities, emotional distress and mental anguish, damage to her self-esteem,\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fand potentially irremediable developmental delays, entitling A.F. to compensatory\n\ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial.” Id.\n\n      A.F.’s § 1983 due process claim (the second cause of action in her\n\ncomplaint) alleged that A.F. had “a protected liberty and property interest in her\n\npublic school education and the wide array of benefits and services that should\n\nhave been made available to her, including an interest in identification,\n\nevaluation, and assistance as a child with learning disabilities.” Id. at 32. The\n\nclaim in turn alleged that EPS personnel “personally participated as [EPS]\n\npolicymakers in the decisions to deny [her] some or all of these benefits and\n\nservices and caused the violations to occur.” Id. The claim alleged several\n\nalternative theories of liability, including “supervisory liability,” id., “failure of\n\n[EPS] to train [its] employees,” id., and EPS’s “establish[ment] [of] a de facto\n\ncourse of conduct of denying disabled students the rights and liberty and property\n\ninterests to which they were entitled,” id. at 33. The claim further alleged that\n\nEPS’s “actions and deliberate indifference denied A.F. the procedural protections\n\nof federal and state law by denying her a public education and special education\n\non an arbitrary and capricious basis,” and that “[n]o post-deprivation hearing was\n\nadequate to remedy these violations of procedural Due Process.” Id. at 34.\n\nLastly, the claim alleged that, “[a]s a direct and proximate result of [EPS’s]\n\nconduct, A.F. suffered emotional distress and mental anguish, damage to her self-\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\festeem, and potentially irremediable developmental delays, entitling A.F. to\n\ncompensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.” Id. at 35.\n\n      On November 13, 2012, defendants removed the complaint to federal\n\ndistrict court, asserting jurisdiction based on the existence of a federal question\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Id. at 16-18.\n\n      On April 8, 2013, defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings,\n\narguing, in pertinent part, that A.F. had failed to exhaust her administrative\n\nremedies as required by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l). Attached to defendants’ motion\n\nwere copies of the due process hearing complaint that A.F. filed with the\n\nNMPED, the mediation agreement between A.F. and EPS settling that complaint,\n\nand A.F.’s motion to dismiss her due process hearing complaint with prejudice.\n\n      On December 6, 2013, the district court issued a memorandum opinion and\n\norder granting defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. In doing so, the\n\ndistrict court first concluded that “[a]ll of [A.F.]’s claims require[d] exhaustion,\n\nbecause the relief she s[ought] [wa]s also available under the IDEA.” Id. at 247.\n\n“The entirety of [A.F.]’s Complaint,” the district court noted, “center[ed] on the\n\ndispute over [EPS’s] efforts to accommodate A.F.’s educational needs,” and her\n\n“discrimination and Section 1983 claims [we]re part and parcel of her\n\neducationally based grievance.” Id. at 249. The district court in turn\n\n“determine[d] that the Mediation Agreement . . . d[id] not satisfy [A.F.]’s\n\nobligation to exhaust her administrative remedies under the IDEA.” Id. More\n\n                                           7\n\fspecifically, the district court concluded that “the IDEA’s exhaustion requirement\n\n. . . is not satisfied when parties enter into a mediated settlement agreement,” and\n\nthat, instead, “there must be, at the very least, a state-level impartial due process\n\nhearing before the aggrieved party can file a civil action in federal court.” Id. at\n\n251. Although the district court acknowledged that “[e]xhaustion is not required\n\nwhere (1) it would be futile, (2) it would fail to provide adequate relief, or (3) an\n\nagency has adopted a policy or pursued a practice of general applicability that is\n\ncontrary to the law,” it noted that A.F. had failed to “address whether any of\n\nthe[se] . . . exceptions to the exhaustion requirement appl[ied] to [her] case.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       On January 2, 2014, A.F. filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment. Id.\n\nat 254. In that motion, A.F. conceded that she was required under the IDEA to\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies, but she argued that the dismissal of her due\n\nprocess hearing complaint, pursuant to the mediation agreement, constituted\n\nexhaustion. A.F. also argued “that the mediated settlement of [her] educational\n\nrelief claims ma[d]e[] further exhaustion of administrative remedies futile.” Id. at\n\n266.\n\n       On July 8, 2014, the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order\n\ndenying A.F.’s motion to alter or amend judgment. The district court reaffirmed\n\nits conclusion that “a mediated settlement agreement does not satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fexhaustion requirement of 1415(l).” Id. at 362. The district court also rejected\n\nA.F.’s assertion that exhaustion would be futile.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                Standard of review\n\n      “We review a district court’s grant of a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings de novo, using the same standard that applies to a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion.” Park Univ.

Op. at 7. In other words, the\n\nmajority interprets the highlighted language as unambiguously requiring a\n\nlitigant, in order to proceed in federal court under a statute other than IDEA, to\n\nforgo resolution of her claim by way of a preliminary meeting or mediation and to\n\nlose at both the administrative trial and appellate levels.\n\n      I submit, however, that the highlighted language is “‘capable of being\n\nunderstood’” in another, and indeed more reasonable, “‘way[].’” Chickasaw\n\nNation v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118467\"><a href=\"/opinion/118467/chickasaw-nation-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (2001) (quoting Webster’s Ninth New\n\nCollegiate Dictionary 77 (1985)). In order to explain this alternative\n\ninterpretation, it is necessary to review how an IDEA complaint is filed and\n\nresolved, including a close examination of the procedures that Congress made\n\navailable under §§ 1415(f) and (g).\n\n      Section 1415(a) requires “[a]ny State educational agency, State agency, or\n\nlocal educational agency that receives assistance under this subchapter” to\n\n“establish and maintain” a variety of procedures “to ensure that children with\n\n\n                                          10\n\fdisabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to\n\nthe provision of a free appropriate public education by such agencies.” 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(a). Of relevance here is “[a]n opportunity . . . to present a complaint.” Id.\n\n§ 1415(b)(6).\n\n      The “opportunity . . . to present a complaint” referred to in § 1415(b)(6) is\n\nfleshed out in greater detail in §§ 1415(f) and (g). To begin with, the process\n\nanticipates that “parents” may file a complaint and in turn be afforded “an\n\nopportunity for an impartial due process hearing, which shall be conducted by the\n\nState educational agency or by the local educational agency, as determined by\n\nState law or by the State educational agency.” Id. § 1415(f)(1)(A). Prior to a due\n\nprocess hearing being conducted, however, and within fifteen days of the receipt\n\nof the complaint, “the local educational agency” must “convene a [preliminary]\n\nmeeting with the parents and the relevant member or members of the IEP Team\n\nwho have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the complaint.” Id. §\n\n1415(f)(1)(B)(i). The intended purpose of this “preliminary meeting” is to allow\n\nthe “the parents of the child [to] discuss their complaint, and the facts that form\n\nthe basis of the complaint,” and to afford “the local educational agency . . . the\n\nopportunity to resolve the complaint.” Id.\n\n      The only exception to this preliminary meeting requirement is if “the\n\nparents and the local educational agency agree in writing to waive such meeting,\n\nor agree to use the mediation process described in subsection (e).” Id. The\n\n\n                                          11\n\fopportunity for mediation, which is detailed in § 1415(e), is intended “to allow\n\nparties to disputes involving any matter . . . to resolve such disputes through a\n\nmediation process.” Id. § 1415(e). Notably, this process anticipates that\n\n“complaint[s]” may be “resolve[d]” through the mediation process by way of “a\n\nlegally binding [written] agreement.” Id. § 1415(e)(2)(F).\n\n      “If the local educational agency has not resolved the complaint to the\n\nsatisfaction of the parents within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint” (by way\n\nof the preliminary meeting or mediation), “the due process hearing may occur.”\n\nId. § 1415(f)(1)(B)(ii). The outcome of such a hearing is “a decision made by a\n\nhearing officer . . . on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether\n\nthe child received a free appropriate public education.” Id. § 1415(f)(3)(E).\n\n      Subsection (g) affords, in certain circumstances, a right of administrative\n\nappeal. Specifically, “[i]f the hearing required by subsection (f) is conducted by\n\na local educational agency, any party aggrieved by the findings and decision\n\nrendered in such a hearing may appeal such findings and decisions to the State\n\neducational agency.” Id. § 1415(g)(1). “The State educational agency,” in turn,\n\nis required to “conduct an impartial review of the findings and decision appealed”\n\nand “make an independent decision upon completion of such review.” Id. §\n\n1415(g)(2).\n\n      With this statutory framework in mind, I now return to the language of §\n\n1415(l) and submit that it can reasonably, and indeed should, be interpreted as\n\n\n                                          12\n\fmerely requiring a claimant to make full use of the procedures outlined in §§\n\n1415(f) and (g) to attempt to resolve her IDEA claim. Under this interpretation, a\n\nmediated resolution of an IDEA claim would be considered sufficient to\n\nconstitute exhaustion for purposes of § 1415(l). That is not only because the\n\nstatutory framework anticipates, and in fact encourages, resolution of IDEA\n\nclaims by way of mediation, but also because a mediated resolution leaves\n\nnothing to be decided at a due process hearing or in an administrative appeal.\n\n         The interpretation of § 1415(l) adopted by the majority is, in my view,\n\ninconsistent with the overall statutory framework developed by Congress. Indeed,\n\nwhy would Congress, after creating a framework that quite clearly encourages\n\nresolution of IDEA claims by various means, force a claimant to avoid resolution\n\nof her claim by mediation or preliminary meeting and lose at both the due process\n\nhearing and administrative appeal stages? Doing so would effectively render\n\nsuperfluous the mediation and preliminary meeting provisions of the statute.\n\nFurther, precisely how could a claimant ensure a loss in both the due process\n\nhearing and the administrative appeal, yet later present a viable claim in federal\n\ncourt?\n\n         The majority’s interpretation is also, in my view, inconsistent with\n\nCongress’s more specific purpose in enacting § 1415(l). Congress added this\n\nstatutory language to clarify its disagreement with the majority opinion, and to\n\neffectively codify Justice Brennan’s dissenting opinion, in Smith v. Robinson,\n\n\n                                           13\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). The key sentence in Justice Brennan’s dissent, for our\n\npurposes, is this:\n\n      The natural resolution of the conflict between the EHA [the\n      predecessor to the IDEA], on the one hand, and §§ 504 and 1983, on\n      the other, is to require the plaintiff with a claim covered by the EHA\n      to pursue relief through the administrative channels established by\n      that Act before seeking redress in the courts under § 504 or § 1983.\n\n468 U.S. at 1024. Nothing in this statement suggests that a plaintiff must forgo\n\nmediation and unsuccessfully pursue relief through the statute’s administrative\n\nchannels before proceeding to federal court on his or her other related claims.\n\nConsequently, it makes little sense to say that Congress intended the opposite\n\nresult in enacting § 1415(l).\n\n      Finally, the majority’s interpretation is inconsistent with the very purpose\n\nof IDEA. It forces a claimant to choose between mediating a resolution to her\n\nIDEA claim (even if the local educational agency were willing to admit and\n\ncorrect the alleged errors) and thereby obtaining some or all of the relief sought\n\nunder IDEA (in this case, for example, the creation of a compensatory education\n\nprogram, the payment of costs associated with attending another school, and\n\ntransportation to and from that school), or forgoing any relief at all and waiting\n\n(while the child ages and potentially continues to receive something other than\n\nthe requisite “free appropriate public education”) in hopes of later filing suit and\n\nobtaining relief under both IDEA and other statutes. That, I again submit, could\n\nnot have been the intent of Congress in adopting § 1415(l).\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                  The other rationales offered by the district court\n\n      The district court in this case purported to “adopt[] the First Circuit’s\n\ninterpretation of the IDEA’s exhaustion requirement” outlined in Weber v.\n\nCranston Sch.

According to\n\nthe district court, in that case “the First Circuit addressed the issue of what\n\nconstitutes exhaustion under the IDEA and found that mediation is insufficient.”\n\nId. at 250 (citing 212 F.3d at 53). A review of Weber, however, indicates that the\n\nFirst Circuit’s holding was not that broad. The parent/plaintiff in Weber argued\n\nthat she complied with § 1415(l)’s exhaustion requirement “through the numerous\n\nadministrative complaints that she filed” prior to initiating her civil lawsuit. 212\n\nF.3d at 53. In rejecting this argument, the First Circuit stated as follows:\n\n      Although Weber filed three CRP complaints with the Rhode Island\n      Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, two complaints\n      with the Office of Equity and Access, and participated in a mediation\n      on the issue of declassification, she never initiated the due process\n      hearing described in IDEA. IDEA’s mandate is explicit: plaintiffs\n      must exhaust IDEA’s impartial due process hearing procedures in\n      order to bring a civil action under subchapter II of IDEA or any\n      “such law[] seeking relief that is also available” under subchapter II\n      of IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).\n\nId. Thus, although the plaintiff/parent in Weber “participated in a mediation” on\n\na single issue, there is no indication that the mediation was successful, i.e., that\n\nshe actually resolved that issue (or any of the administrative complaints) by way\n\nof a written mediation agreement. Consequently, the Weber decision did not\n\naddress the question at issue in this case, i.e., whether the resolution of a due\n\n\n                                          15\n\fprocess hearing complaint by way of a written mediation agreement is sufficient\n\nto constitute exhaustion of the procedures outlined in subsections (f) and (g).\n\n       The district court also asserted that its “determination that a settlement does\n\nnot meet the exhaustion requirements [wa]s supported by the policy rationales\n\nrequiring exhaustion.” App. at 251. These policy rationales, the district court\n\nasserted, include “(1) permitting the exercise of agency discretion and expertise\n\non issues requiring these characteristics; (2) allowing the full development of\n\ntechnical issues and a factual record prior to court review; (3) preventing\n\ndeliberate disregard and circumvention of agency procedures established by\n\nCongress; and (4) avoiding unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency\n\nthe first opportunity to correct any error.” Id. at 251-52 (quoting Ass’n for Cmty.\n\nLiving v. Romer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606105\"><a href=\"/opinion/606105/association-for-community-living-in-colorado-as-representative-of-its/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1044 (10th Cir. 1993). And, according to the\n\ndistrict court, “allowing the settlement in this case to constitute exhaustion would\n\npermit plaintiffs to proceed with their claims without developing a factual record,\n\nallowing the educational system to exercise its expertise in resolving this conflict,\n\nor providing the parties a full opportunity to avoid excessive litigation.” Id. at\n\n252.\n\n       The district court’s analysis was wrong. To be sure, the use of a written\n\nmediation agreement eliminates the need for a due process hearing under §\n\n1415(f), and, as a result, there is no administrative record that can be reviewed in\n\nany subsequent civil action. But resolving a due process complaint by mediation\n\n\n                                          16\n\fotherwise appears to serve the purposes of IDEA, and in an arguably more\n\nefficient fashion than by way of a due process hearing and subsequent\n\nadministrative appeal. In particular, it allows the local educational agency that is\n\nthe subject of the complaint to exercise its discretion and expertise in order to\n\nimmediately correct any errors that may have occurred. Further, by preventing\n\nthe need for a due process hearing and subsequent administrative appeal, it spares\n\nresources of local and State educational agencies. And, most importantly, it best\n\nserves the interests of the child at issue by promptly resolving the pending issues.\n\n                                          III\n\n      In sum, I conclude that resolution of a due process complaint by way of a\n\nwritten mediation agreement constitutes exhaustion for purposes of § 1415(l).\n\nBecause the district court concluded otherwise, I would reverse the judgment of\n\nthe district court and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f</pre>",
