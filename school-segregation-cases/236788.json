Baird has sued her employer, claiming discrimination on the basis of\n\nher race and sex, retaliation for engaging in protected activity, and a hostile work environment in\n\nviolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Before the\n\nCourt is defendant’s motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, defendant’s motion will be granted.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\nI.     FACTUAL HISTORY\n\n       A.      Background\n\n       Plaintiff is an African-American female and is currently employed as an\n\nERISA/bankruptcy attorney in the Office of the Chief Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty\n\nCorporation (“PBGC”). (First Amended Complaint [“Compl.”] ¶¶ 4, 7.) Although appearing\n\npro se, plaintiff is an experienced litigant, having represented herself in numerous EEO\n\ncomplaints and civil actions, see, e.g., Anderson v. International Federation of Professional &\n\nTechnical Engineers, No. 10-0895 (D.D.C. filed May 28, 2010); Baird v. Holway, No. 10-0572\n\f(D.D.C. filed April 9, 2010); Baird v. Holway, 539 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D.D.C. 2008); Baird v.\n\nChao, No. 03-1759 (D.D.C. filed August 19, 2003), and having served as a representative for\n\nPBGC employees with respect to their EEO complaints. (See Compl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff was also an\n\nactive member of the union at PBGC, NAGE Local R3-77, and she served as union president\n\nfrom April 2007 until its dissolution in early 2009. (Id. ¶¶ 38, 51.)\n\n        On October 2, 2002, plaintiff filed a formal EEO complaint against PBGC to redress\n\nworkplace concerns in her department. (Id. ¶ 9.) Thereafter, on November 13, 2002, plaintiff\n\nclaims that she was accosted by a supervisor in her department. (Id.) She filed a grievance with\n\nher department, the Office of General Counsel (“OGC”), regarding the incident, accusing PBGC\n\nof failing to investigate and to take action to correct the behavior. (Id. ¶ 11.) The dispute went\n\nto arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, and the arbitrator ruled in her favor in\n\n2005. (Id. ¶¶ 11, 18-20.) PBGC appealed the arbitrator’s decision in 2008 (id. ¶ 22), which was\n\nupheld by the Federal Labor Relations Authority on April 28, 2010. (Dkt. #20.) While the\n\nsubject of this arbitration is not before the Court, plaintiff claims this incident constitutes\n\nrelevant evidence, as well as protected activity for purposes of plaintiff’s retaliation claims.\n\n        B.      2005 EEO Complaint (Agency No. 05-12)\n\n        In spring 2005, two of plaintiff’s co-workers at PBGC, Robert Perry and Dwayne Jeffers,\n\nconcluded that plaintiff had disseminated flyers throughout the workplace that accused them of\n\ntriggering a PBGC scan of its email system, which led to the firing and disciplining of several\n\nemployees. (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) In response, Mr. Jeffers began sending emails to other PBGC\n\nemployees calling plaintiff “psychotic.” (Id. ¶ 26.) On April 8, 2005, plaintiff filed several\n\ncomplaints with PBGC’s Human Resources Department (“HRD”) regarding these emails. (Id.\n\n¶ 27.) On June 16, 2005, PBGC sent an email to all employees regarding “Inappropriate use of\n\nPBGC Resources.” (Id. ¶ 28.) HRD official Richard Lattimer sent a subordinate to obtain\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fplaintiff’s signature acknowledging that she had received this email. (Id.) Mr. Lattimer\n\nrequested this signature only from plaintiff and two other employees. (Id.) Plaintiff refused to\n\nsign the acknowledgment, believing it to be retaliatory. (Id.) The plaintiff’s supervisor was\n\ncontacted, and a meeting was held for the purpose of obtaining plaintiff’s acknowledgment of\n\nreceipt of the email. (Id. ¶ 29.) At the meeting, an HRD official alleged that plaintiff had\n\ndisseminated the flyers mentioned above. (Id.) Plaintiff reported this incident to PBGC, but\n\naccording to her, PBGC failed to respond. (Id. ¶ 30.) In August 2005, plaintiff filed formal EEO\n\ncomplaint No. 05-12 challenging PBGC’s failure to investigate her complaints. (Id. ¶¶ 27, 30.)\n\nThereafter, in November 2005, PBGC hired the law firm of Littler Mendelson to conduct an\n\ninvestigation into, among other things, plaintiff’s complaints relating to the dissemination of\n\ninappropriate information in the workplace. (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiff cooperated with this\n\ninvestigation and was informed in February 2006 that Litter Mendelson had found no violation\n\nof PBGC workplace rules because the conduct complained of constituted protected union\n\nactivity. (Id. ¶¶ 31, 33.)\n\n        C.      2006 EEO Complaints (Agency Nos. 06-09 and 07-01)\n\n        On April 10, 2006, plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint No. 06-09 alleging\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex and reprisal on the grounds that the agency had failed to\n\npromptly respond to her complaints, allowed medical and personal information to be\n\ndisseminated by her union representative, blocked her email messages to her union\n\nrepresentative and a witness in the arbitration, and sought to sanction her. Baird v. Snowbarger,\n\nEEOC Appeal No. 0120072177, Agency Nos. 06-09 and 07-01 (July 10, 2009). On October 16,\n\n2006, plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint 07-01 alleging that PBGC’s EEO office improperly\n\nrecommended dismissal of her 2005 EEO complaint. Id. PBGC consolidated these two\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fcomplaints and dismissed them, and the EEOC affirmed the agency’s dismissal on July 10, 2009.\n\nId.\n\n       D.      2007 EEO Complaint (Agency No. 07-06)\n\n       On January 11, 2007, Raymond Forster, the primary OGC attorney who represented\n\nPBGC in plaintiff’s union arbitration, sent an email to several PBGC employees advising the\n\n“11th floor OGC staff in the area of conference room 11E to use caution about what they say in\n\nhalls or open offices,” for “[c]ertain people who will be in 11E have a way of twisting and\n\npublicizing their litigation induced hallucinations.” (Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss or,\n\nAlternatively, for Summary Judgment [“Def.’s Mot.”] Ex. 3; Compl. ¶ 36.) Plaintiff reported the\n\nemail to HRD, but according to plaintiff, defendant did not investigate the matter and did not\n\ntake disciplinary action against Forster. (Id. ¶ 37.) Plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint No. 07-\n\n06 in connection with this matter on February 12, 2007. (Def.’s Mot. Ex. 3.) PBGC’s EEO\n\noffice accepted the complaint for investigation on June 15, 2007, and the investigation was\n\ncompleted on April 1, 2008. (Id.) Plaintiff requested a hearing before the EEOC on May 9,\n\n2008, but filed this action prior to a final EEOC decision. (Id. Exs. 31-32.)\n\n       E.      EEO Complaints Nos. 09-02 and 09-06\n\n       On October 9, 2008, plaintiff filed yet another EEO complaint, No. 09-02, in which she\n\nalleged that she was subjected to race discrimination, reprisal, and a hostile work environment\n\nfor “winning a liability decision finding unlawful retaliation by labor management staff of PBGC\n\nin 2005 & 2008 . . . filing EEO complaints and civil action against PBGC, and representing\n\nemployees in EEO matters from 2002-2008.” (Id. Ex. 21.) Plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint\n\nNo. 09-06 on similar grounds on February 23, 2009. (Id. Ex 22.) In these complaints, plaintiff\n\nalleged, inter alia, that PBGC “attacked her law license” and assigned her non-EEO work so that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fshe would not have sufficient time to work on EEO matters. (Id. Exs. 21-22.) Final\n\nadministrative action in these complaints occurred on April 28, 2009. (Id. Ex. 23.)\n\n          F.     EEO Complaint No. 08-03\n\n          Plaintiff filed EEO complaint No. 08-03 on November 29, 2007, alleging discrimination,\n\nretaliation, and hostile work environment when, in her capacity as union president, she engaged\n\nin several union activities, prompting adverse responses by agency management. Baird v.\n\nMillard, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083045, Agency No. 0803 (Nov. 7, 2008). The agency\n\ndismissed the complaint on May 20, 2008, and the EEOC affirmed this dismissal on November\n\n5, 2008. Id.\n\n          G.     EEO Complaint No. FC-001-2010\n\n          In August 2009, plaintiff, in her capacity as counsel for fellow employee Richard\n\nAnderson, was deposing Ruben Moreno, an HRD labor management official, in Mr. Anderson’s\n\nEEO action. (Compl. ¶ 55.) PBGC attorney Scott Schwartz was also present. (Id.) During a\n\nbreak in the deposition, Mr. Moreno began angrily yelling at plaintiff and pounding the table.\n\n(Id.) Plaintiff reported this incident to PBGC officials, who did not, in her view, take corrective\n\naction. (Id.) As a result, plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint No. FC-001-2010 on October 27,\n\n2009, which was dismissed by PBGC’s EEO office on December 29, 2009. (Def.’s Mot. Exs.\n\n24-25.)\n\n                                                ***\n\n          Plaintiff filed her initial complaint on June 15, 2009, and an amended complaint on\n\nFebruary 19, 2010. Defendant responded by moving to dismiss all counts on the grounds of\n\nfailure to exhaust or for failure to state a claim, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.\n\nPlaintiff has opposed this motion, or in the alternative, has sought discovery under Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 56(f).\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f                                            ANALYSIS\n\nI.     LEGAL STANDARD: MOTION TO DISMISS\n\n       Despite some confusion in this jurisdiction regarding “whether a failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies is properly brought in a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, as a jurisdictional defect,\n\nor in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim,” recent cases “favor treating failure to\n\nexhaust as a failure to state a claim.” Hansen v. Billington, 644 F. Supp. 2d 97, 102 (D.D.C.\n\n2009) (listing cases); see also Kilby-Robb v. Spellings, 309 F. App’x. 422, 423 n.1 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2009) (“[T]he mandatory exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional.”).\n\n       As the Supreme Court recently held in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), “[t]o\n\nsurvive a motion to dismiss [under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], a\n\ncomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is\n\nplausible on its face.’” Id. at 1949 (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n\n(2007)). A complaint must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) if it consists only of “[t]hreadbare\n\nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.” Id.\n\n“Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability, it ‘stops\n\nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The allegations\n\nin plaintiff’s complaint are presumed true at this stage and all reasonable factual inferences must\n\nbe construed in the plaintiff’s favor. Maljack Prods. v. Motion Picture Ass’n of Am., 52 F.3d\n\n373, 375 (D.C. Cir. 1995). “However, ‘the court need not accept inferences drawn by plaintiffs\n\nif such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint.’” Hughes v. Abell, 634 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 110, 113 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Kowal v. MCI Commc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1994)). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider only “the facts\n\nalleged in the complaint, documents attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fcomplaint, and matters about which the Court may take judicial notice.” Hansen, 644 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 102 (internal quotation omitted).\n\n       Although plaintiff is proceeding pro se, she is an attorney and an experienced litigant.1\n\nTherefore, plaintiff “is not automatically subject to the very liberal standards afforded to a non-\n\nattorney pro se plaintiff because an attorney is presumed to have a knowledge of the legal system\n\nand need less protections from the court.” Richards v. Duke University, 480 F. Supp. 2d 222,\n\n234 (D.D.C. 2007), aff’d, No. 07-5119, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 30275 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 27, 2007).\n\nII.    EXHAUSTION OF TITLE VII CLAIMS\n\n       “[A] timely administrative charge is a prerequisite to initiation of a Title VII action in the\n\nDistrict Court.” Jarrell v. U.S. Postal Serv., 753 F.2d 1088, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (citing Brown\n\nv. General Services Administration, 425 U.S. 820, 832-33 (1976)). An employee of the federal\n\ngovernment complaining of discrimination must “initiate contact” with an EEO counsel within\n\n45 days of the allegedly discriminatory action or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45\n\ndays of the effective date of the action. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1). If the matter is not resolved\n\ninformally, the complainant may file a formal complaint against the agency, which the agency\n\nmust investigate within 180 days of filing. 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.105(d), 106(e)(2), 108(e). A\n\ncomplainant must file her formal charge within 180 or 300 days after the alleged unlawful\n\nemployment practice occurred. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). “Each discrete discriminatory act\n\nstarts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act” and “[t]he charge, therefore, must be filed\n\n1\n See, e.g., Anderson v. International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, No. 10-\n0895, (D.D.C. filed May 28, 2010); Baird v. Holway, No. 10-0572 (D.D.C. filed April 9, 2010);\nBaird v. Holway, 539 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D.D.C. 2008); Baird v. Chao, No. 03-1759 (D.D.C. filed\nAugust 19, 2003); Baird v. Snowbarger, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072177, Agency Nos. 06-09\nand 07-01 (July 10, 2009); Baird v. Millard, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083045, Agency No. 0803\n(Nov. 7, 2008); Baird v. Snowbarger, EEOC Appeal No. 01200639481, Agency No. 05-12\n(March 16, 2007); Baird v. Belt, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43609, Agency No. 04-01 (October 22,\n2004).\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fwithin the 180- or 300-day time period after the discrete discriminatory act occurred.” Nat’l R.R.\n\nPassenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002). Once the agency investigation\n\nconcludes, the employee has the right to (1) request a hearing and decision from an\n\nadministrative judge, or (2) request an immediate final decision from the agency. 29 C.F.R. §\n\n1614.108(f). The employee may appeal a decision of the administrative judge or the agency to\n\nthe EEOC or file a civil action in federal district court within 90 days of the receipt of a notice of\n\nfinal action. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(c); 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.401, 1614.407.\n\n       In filing a civil action in district court following an EEO complaint, an employee may\n\nonly file claims that are “like or reasonably related to the allegations of the [EEO] charge and\n\ngrow[] out of such allegations.” Park v. Howard Univ., 71 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “At a minimum, the Title VII claims must arise from ‘the\n\nadministrative investigation that can reasonably be expected to follow the charge of\n\ndiscrimination.’” Id. (quoting Chisholm v. U.S. Postal Serv., 665 F.2d 482, 491 (4th Cir. 1981)).\n\nThe Title VII exhaustion requirement also means that “discrete discriminatory acts are not\n\nactionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.”\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. at 113.\n\n       The parties appear to be in agreement that the allegations in complaints FC-006-2010 and\n\nFC-010-2010 are not properly before this Court. The specific allegations in these complaints\n\nappear nowhere in plaintiff’s amended complaint (Def. Mot. at 18), and plaintiff agrees that\n\nthese complaints are still in the administrative process and therefore have not yet been exhausted.\n\n(Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment [“Pl.’s Opp.”] at 17.) As a result, to the extent plaintiff’s First Amended\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fComplaint could be construed to encompass complaints FC-006-2010 and FC-010-2010,\n\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss these claims is granted.\n\n       Defendant has also moved to dismiss plaintiff’s claims based on EEO complaints 06-09,\n\n07-01, 08-03, 09-02, 09-06, and FC-001-2010, arguing that plaintiff has failed to timely file a\n\ncivil action within 90 days after receipt of notice of final agency action, as required by 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-16(c) and 29 C.F.R. § 1614.407(a).\n\n       It is uncontested that final agency action in EEO complaint FC-001-2010 occurred on\n\nDecember 29, 2009, when PBGC’s EEO office dismissed plaintiff’s complaint regarding Ruben\n\nMoreno’s conduct at a deposition that plaintiff was conducting. (Def.’s Mot. at 16; Pl.’s Opp. at\n\n15.) Plaintiff’s amended complaint raising this claim was filed on February 19, 2010. (See\n\nCompl. ¶ 55.) Therefore, the Court declines to dismiss FC-001-2010 for failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies or to timely file a civil action following final administrative action.\n\n       The majority of plaintiff’s complaints, however, were not filed within the 90-day time\n\nperiod following final administrative action. Final administrative action in EEO complaint 08-03\n\nwas on November 5, 2008. Baird v. Millard, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083045, Agency No. 0803\n\n(Nov. 7, 2008). Plaintiff’s original complaint was filed on June 15, 2009. Final administrative\n\naction in complaints 09-02 and 09-06 occurred on April 28, 2009 (Def. Mot. Ex. 23),2 and final\n\n\n\n2\n  The Court takes judicial notice of PBGC’s April 28, 2009 letter dismissing plaintiff’s\ncomplaints. The Court notes that exhibits, such as the EEOC documents attached to defendant’s\nmotion, may be considered in deciding the motion to dismiss because “matters incorporated by\nreference or integral to the claim, items subject to judicial notice, matters of public record,\norders, [and] items appearing in the record of the case . . . may be considered by the district court\nwithout converting the motion into one for summary judgment.” 5B Charles A. Wright & Arthur\nR. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357, at 376 (3d ed. 2004); Rogan v. Giant Eagle,\nInc., 113 F.Supp.2d 777, 782 (W.D. Pa. 2000) (“It is clear to us that under the applicable legal\nstandard we may consider the EEOC charge and related EEOC documents, including the letter\nfrom the EEOC summarizing its investigation, the right to sue letter, and the intake\nquestionnaire, either as undisputed documents referenced in the complaint or central to the\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fadministrative action in complaint 06-09/07-01 (consolidated) occurred on July 10, 2009. Baird\n\nv. Snowbarger, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072177, Agency Nos. 06-09 and 07-01 (July 10, 2009).\n\nPlaintiff’s original complaint did not raise the issues in EEO complaints 09-02, 09-06, or 06-\n\n09/07-01, and her amended complaint was not filed until February 19, 2010. Plaintiff has\n\ntherefore failed to bring a timely civil action raising EEO complaints 08-03, 09-02, 09-06, or 06-\n\n09/07-01 (consolidated). See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(c); 29 C.F.R. 1614.407(a).\n\n       It is within the Court’s discretion to excuse a plaintiff’s failure to meet administrative\n\ntime limits by applying the doctrine of equitable tolling. Johnson v. Billington, 404 F. Supp. 2d\n\n157, 162 (D.D.C. 2005). The D.C. Circuit has “set a high hurdle for equitable tolling, allowing a\n\nstatute to be tolled only in extraordinary and carefully circumscribed instances,”\n\nCommunications Vending Corp. of Az. v. FCC, 365 F.3d 1064, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted), including “‘where a motion for appointment of counsel is\n\npending and equity would justify tolling the statutory period[,] . . . where the court has led the\n\nplaintiff to believe that she had done everything required of her, . . . [or] where affirmative\n\nmisconduct on the part of a defendant lulled the plaintiff into inaction.’” Baldwin County\n\nWelcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 151 (1984). See also Smith-Haynie v. District of\n\nColumbia, 155 F.3d 575, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (allowing for equitable tolling when a plaintiff is\n\nfound to be non compos mentis). A plaintiff’s failure to exercise due diligence in filing is\n\ninsufficient to warrant the application of equitable tolling. See Battle v. Rubin, 121 F. Supp. 2d\n\n4, 8 (D.D.C. 2000) (plaintiff must have exercised due diligence and her excuse for failure to\n\ntimely file must be “more than a garden variety claim of excusable neglect”). The plaintiff bears\n\n\n\nplaintiff's claim, or as information which is a matter of public record, without converting this\nmotion to one for summary judgment.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fthe burden of proving “facts supporting equitable avoidance of the result.” Bowden v. United\n\nStates, 106 F.3d 433, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n       In her opposition, plaintiff requests that the Court toll the statute because she has been\n\n“beleaguered” by the actions of defendant’s employees who have failed to provide her with the\n\n“positive and productive work environment she is entitled to.” (Pl.’s Opp. at 15.) She further\n\nalleges that she suffers from health problems as a result of defendant’s conduct. (Id. at 16.)\n\nSuch allegations, even if true, are insufficient for purposes of invoking the doctrine of equitable\n\ntolling. There is no allegation or evidence of “affirmative misconduct” by defendant designed to\n\n“lull plaintiff into inaction” or otherwise prejudice her ability to timely file. McAlister, 2010\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 86442, at *5. Plaintiff’s alleged hardships, which at their core simply restate\n\nthe allegations in her complaint, simply do not constitute the type of “extraordinary and carefully\n\ncircumscribed instance[s]” that warrant equitable tolling. Communications Vending Corp., 365\n\nF.3d at 1075. Plaintiff may “describe emotional difficult[ties], but of a kind that [were] basically\n\nrelated to the work environment. . . . She does not tell us that she was unable to engage in\n\nrational thought and deliberate decision making sufficient to pursue her claim alone or through\n\ncounsel.” Smith-Haynie, 155 F.3d at 580 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIndeed, during the complained-of period, plaintiff has filed the instant action, amended her\n\ncomplaint, filed numerous EEO complaints and civil actions in this Court,3 and represented\n\nfellow union members in no fewer than six EEO claims against defendant. (See Def.’s Reply Ex.\n\n1.) In short, there is no evidence to support an inference that plaintiff was “in fact prevented . . .\n3\n See, e.g., Anderson v. International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, No. 10-\n0895, (D.D.C. filed May 28, 2010); Baird v. Holway, No. 10-0572 (D.D.C. filed April 9, 2010);\nBaird v. Holway, 539 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D.D.C. 2008); Baird v. Snowbarger, EEOC Appeal No.\n0120072177, Agency Nos. 06-09 and 07-01 (July 10, 2009); Baird v. Millard, EEOC Appeal No.\n0120083045, Agency No. 0803 (Nov. 7, 2008); Baird v. Snowbarger, EEOC Appeal No.\n01200639481, Agency No. 05-12 (March 16, 2007).\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\ffrom managing her affairs.” Smith-Haynie, 155 F.3d at 580 (emphasis in original) (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Plaintiff argues in the alternative that the discrete claims made in her untimely EEO\n\ncomplaints constitute a hostile work environment when considered in the aggregate and should\n\nbe considered for this purpose alone. (Pl.’s Opp. at 16-17.) As explained more fully in Section\n\nIII(C) infra, plaintiff cannot “cobbl[e] together a number of distinct, disparate acts”—indeed, the\n\n“‘very employment actions [s]he claims are retaliatory’”—and thereby “‘bootstrap alleged\n\nretaliatory incidents into a broader hostile work environment claim.’” Franklin v. Potter, 600 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 38, 76 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Keeley v. Small, 391 F. Supp. 2d 30, 51 (D.D.C. 2005)).\n\n       Accordingly, defendant’s motion to dismiss is granted as to EEO complaints 08-03, 09-\n\n02, 09-06, and 06-09/07-01 (consolidated). The Court will therefore address plaintiff’s\n\nremaining claims: EEO Complaint No. 05-12 (request to acknowledge receipt of memorandum\n\nand failure to adequately investigate April 2005 complaints regarding insulting emails); EEO\n\nComplaint No. 07-06 (failure to investigate January 2007 complaint regarding insulting email);\n\nand EEO Complaint No. FC-001-2010 (failure to take corrective action when plaintiff was yelled\n\nat by Mr. Moreno during his deposition).\n\nIII.   TITLE VII\n\n        Plaintiff alleges that she was the target of numerous complaints of harassing emails,\n\ninsults, and unfounded allegations by her co-workers and litigation opponents over a period of\n\nseveral years. (Pl.’s Reply at 21-23.) While she does not allege that these underlying\n\ncommunications were themselves motivated by her race, sex, or prior protected activity,4\n\n4\n  The investigation conducted by Littler Mendelson concluded that the emails sent by Robert\nPerry and Dwayne Jeffers, both of whom are African-American, related to protected union\nactivity. Moreover, both Forster and Moreno were plaintiff’s adversaries in litigation during the\ntime in question.\n\n\n                                                12\n\fplaintiff claims that the defendant discriminated and retaliated against her by failing to conduct\n\ntimely investigations into these complaints or by failing to investigate her complaints at all.\n\nPlaintiff further asserts that PBGC “failed to take appropriate corrective action” and thus “did not\n\nproperly stop the activities of other individuals in sending improper, defamatory, and threatening\n\nemails.” (Id. at 25.) Furthermore, plaintiff alleges that PBGC’s “intentional failure” to\n\n“investigate or take appropriate corrective action” in response to her complaints created a hostile\n\nwork environment. (Id.)\n\n        As an initial matter, the Court must note that plaintiff appears to be proceeding on the\n\nfundamental misunderstanding that under Title VII, “[d]efendant is obligated to respond to\n\ncomplaints and take corrective action where warranted to ensure Plaintiff has a ‘positive and\n\nproductive work environment.’” (Pl.’s Opp. at 21 (citing PBGC “workplace rules”) (emphasis\n\nadded); see id. at 22 (“Defendant has repeatedly failed to apply its workplace rules to protect the\n\nPlaintiff in the workplace, violating its own policy . . . .”).) Contrary to plaintiff’s belief, Title\n\nVII is not “‘a general civility code for the American workplace.’” Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry.\n\nCo. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523\n\nU.S. 75, 80 (1998)). Therefore, to the extent that plaintiff attempts to utilize Title VII to create a\n\nfederal cause of action for violations of PBGC’s internal rules and policies, her claims fail as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n        A.       Disparate Treatment\n\n        Defendant argues that plaintiff’s remaining disparate treatment claims must be dismissed\n\nbecause the alleged acts do not constitute “adverse employment action[s]” under Title VII.\n\n(Def.’s Mot. at 18-21.) Defendant challenges plaintiff’s allegations that the following were\n\nadverse actions: (1) the agency’s failure to conduct a timely and adequate investigation of her\n\ncomplaints of receiving inappropriate emails from other employees and from opposing counsel\n\n\n                                                   13\n\frepresenting the agency in plaintiff’s union grievance (Compl. ¶¶ 27, 30, 31, 33, 37); (2) PBGC’s\n\n“fail[ure] to take corrective action” in response to Ruben Moreno yelling at her while she was\n\ntaking his deposition in a co-worker’s EEO case (id. ¶ 55); and (3) PBGC’s selective attempt to\n\nobtain plaintiff’s signature acknowledging receipt of an email titled: “Inappropriate use of PBGC\n\nresources.” (Id. ¶ 28.)\n\n       To succeed on a claim of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff has the initial burden\n\nof establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that “(1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action\n\ngives rise to an inference of discrimination.” Stella v. Mineta, 284 F.3d 135, 145 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2002); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).\n\n       To show an adverse action, plaintiff must show “a significant change in employment\n\nstatus, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.” Douglas v. Preston, 559\n\nF.3d 549, 552 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). “[A]n employee\n\nsuffers an adverse employment action if he experiences materially adverse consequences\n\naffecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or future employment opportunities\n\nsuch that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm.” Forkkio v. Powell, 306\n\nF.3d 1127, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 457 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).\n\nIn most cases, a tangible employment action “‘inflicts direct economic harm.’” Douglas, 559\n\nF.3d at 552 (quoting Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 762 (1998)). However,\n\nwhere the alleged significant change in employment status is not obvious, “an employee must go\n\nthe further step of demonstrating how the decision nonetheless caused such an objectively\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\ftangible harm,” which requires a court “to consider whether the alleged harm is unduly\n\nspeculative.” Douglas, 559 F.3d at 553.\n\n               1.       Failure to Investigate or Discipline Other Employees\n\n       Plaintiff claims that PBGC discriminated against her on the basis of her race and sex\n\nwhen it “fail[ed] to investigate complaints of highly inappropriate conduct towards her” (Compl.\n\n¶ 63), and “refused to grant [her] the conditions of employment she was entitled to” through the\n\napplication of, inter alia, PBGC’s workplace rules. (Id. ¶¶ 73, 81.) Specifically, plaintiff claims\n\nthat PBGC failed: (1) to adequately investigate her complaints in April 2005 that she was the\n\nsubject of a number of insulting emails attacking her as “psychotic”; (2) to investigate her\n\ncomplaint in January 2007 that Forster sent an email stating that plaintiff experienced “litigation\n\ninduced hallucinations”; and (3) to take corrective action when Moreno yelled at her during a\n\ndeposition. (Id. ¶¶ 27, 30, 31, 33, 37, 55.) Assuming the truth of these allegations, as the Court\n\nmust at this stage, plaintiff’s claims do not constitute adverse employment actions, and thus, she\n\ncannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Even if PBGC had failed to investigate\n\nplaintiff’s claims,5 this would not effect a “significant change” in plaintiff’s employment status,\n\n“such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.” Douglas, 559 F.3d at 552\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant’s motion to dismiss these claims will\n\ntherefore be granted.\n\n               2.       Requesting Signature Acknowledging Receipt of Memorandum\n\n       Plaintiff claims she was discriminated against when defendant sought to obtain her\n\nsignature acknowledging that she had received a memorandum sent to all PBGC employees\n\n5\n As the Court notes below, plaintiff admits that PBGC did in fact investigate several of her\ncomplaints, but failed to reach outcomes that were to her satisfaction.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fregarding the “Inappropriate use of PBGC Resources.” (Compl. ¶¶ 28-29.) Plaintiff believed\n\nshe had been singled out, and thus she refused to sign the acknowledgement. (Id.) While being\n\nasked to acknowledge receipt of a memorandum may have been “unprecedented” (id.), and may\n\nhave been an annoyance to plaintiff, it does not rise to the level of objectively tangible harm.\n\nKinsey v. City of Jacksonville, No. 3:01-785, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31870, at *22-23 (M.D. Fla.\n\nDec. 6, 2005) (even requiring signature to acknowledge receipt of form not an adverse action\n\nunder Title VII); see also Williams v. Dodaro, 576 F. Supp. 2d 72, 88-89 (D.D.C. 2008) (letter\n\nreminding plaintiff that she was required to keep supervisor apprised of information did not\n\nconstitute adverse employment action where letter “did not indicate that it was a reprimand, . . .\n\nwas not placed in [plaintiff’s] personnel file, and . . . did not lead to any disciplinary action\n\nlevied against [plaintiff]”); see also Cochise v. Salazar, 601 F. Supp. 2d 196, 201 (D.D.C. 2009)\n\n(letters of counseling or warning without attendant effects on employment are not “materially\n\nadverse”), aff’d, No. 09-5115, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 10672 (D.C. Cir. May 24, 2010);\n\nHutchinson v. Holder, 668 F. Supp. 2d 201, 217-18 (D.D.C. 2009) (requirement that plaintiff\n\ncommunicate sick leave requests directly to supervisor instead of normal procedure of\n\ncommunicating such requests to a co-worker did not constitute adverse action). As such, a\n\nrequest that plaintiff merely acknowledge the receipt of the memorandum does not constitute an\n\nadverse employment action, and this claim will be dismissed.\n\n        B.      Retaliation\n\n        “The antiretaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from\n\nretaliation that produces an injury or harm.” Burlington, 548 U.S. at 67. To prove a retaliation\n\nclaim under Title VII, a plaintiff “generally must establish that he or she suffered (i) a materially\n\nadverse action (ii) because he or she had brought or threatened to bring a discrimination claim.”\n\nBaloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2008). For a retaliation claim, the\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fconcept of adverse action is broader than in the discrimination context since it “can encompass\n\nharms unrelated to employment or the workplace ‘so long as a reasonable employee would have\n\nfound the challenged action materially adverse.’” Rattigan v. Holder, 604 F. Supp. 2d 33, 46\n\n(D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1198 n.4 (internal citation omitted)). To be\n\nmaterially adverse, the action must be one that “well might have ‘dissuaded a reasonable worker\n\nfrom making or supporting a charge of discrimination.’” Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68 (quoting\n\nRochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1211, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).\n\n               1.      Failure to Investigate or Discipline Other Employees\n\n       Even under the more lenient standard set forth for retaliation claims in Burlington, the\n\nharm complained of by plaintiff is simply too attenuated to be actionable under Title VII.6 While\n\nan employer’s failure to investigate or punish another employee could have an impact on the\n\nemployee who is the subject of a complaint, the critical inquiry is not whether the targets of\n\nplaintiff’s complaints were punished, but whether plaintiff was harmed. See Burlington, 548\n\nU.S. at 67 (“[T]he antiretaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but\n\nfrom retaliation that produces an injury or harm.”). Even assuming arguendo that plaintiff\n\nsuffered emotional distress as a result of the disparaging emails and remarks from her co-workers\n\nand litigation opponents7 (Compl. ¶¶ 65, 70), whether plaintiff suffered objective harm as a result\n\n\n6\n While this Court has noted that “[t]he issue of whether a particular employment action was\nmaterially adverse is fact-intensive and ‘depends upon the circumstances of the particular case,’”\nHutchinson v. Holder, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 218 (quoting Howard v. Gutierrez, 237 F.R.D. 310,\n313 (D.D.C. 2006)), this certainly does not preclude the Court from dismissing a claim under\nRule 12(b)(6) where, as a matter of law, it “do[es] not rise to the level of an adverse employment\naction for purposes of a retaliation claim.” Rattigan v. Gonzales, 503 F. Supp. 2d 56, 75 (D.D.C.\n2007); see also Brookens v. Solis, 616 F. Supp. 2d 81, 91-92 (D.D.C. 2009).\n7\n As an experienced litigant, plaintiff is no doubt aware that “all litigation, by its very nature, is\nbound to feature a certain degree of adversarial posturing.” Lewis v. School Bd. of Loudoun\nCounty, 808 F. Supp. 523, 528 (E.D. Va. 1992).\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fof defendant’s alleged failure to investigate these incidents or to impose discipline is speculative\n\nat best. Plaintiff improperly assumes, without foundation, (1) that such investigations would\n\nhave concluded in her favor, (2) that the investigations would have resulted in disciplinary\n\naction, and (3) that the discipline would have halted future incidents by different individuals in\n\ncompletely dissimilar situations. Such speculation cannot form the basis of a Title VII retaliation\n\nclaim. See Sewell v. Chao, 532 F. Supp. 2d 126, 137 (D.D.C. 2008) (“mere speculation”\n\ninsufficient to establish materially adverse consequences), aff’d sub nom. Sewell v. Hugler, No.\n\n08-5079, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 4136 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 25, 2009).\n\n       It is also worth noting that each underlying event plaintiff complained of was a minor,\n\ntrivial annoyance, and such “sporadic verbal altercations or disagreements do not [themselves]\n\nqualify as adverse actions for purposes of [a] retaliation claim[].” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1199.\n\n“An employee’s decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from\n\nthose petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees\n\nexperience.” Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68. Even assuming that PBGC failed to investigate\n\nplaintiff’s complaints, it is difficult to see how a “reasonable worker” would be “dissuaded . . .\n\nfrom making or supporting a charge of discrimination,” id., simply because her employer failed\n\nto investigate each and every time she reported such “petty slights or minor annoyances” to her\n\nsuperiors. See Barbour v. Browner, 181 F.3d 1342, 1346, (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Dale v. Chi.\n\nTrib. Co., 797 F.2d 458, 464 (7th Cir. 1986)) (“Title VII . . . does not authorize a Federal court to\n\nbecome a ‘super-personnel department that reexamines an entity’s business decisions.’”). This\n\ncase is therefore readily distinguishable from a failure to investigate the extreme conduct at issue\n\nin Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1211 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (FBI’s refusal to investigate death threats\n\nmade by federal prisoner against plaintiff and wife), or the conduct in Hawkins v. Anheuser-\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fBusch, Inc., 517 F.3d 321 (6th Cir. 2008) (failure to investigate employee who had set fire to\n\nplaintiff’s car and threatened to kill her if she reported the harassment).\n\n        Furthermore, it is significant that as to some of plaintiff’s claims, she alleges not a failure\n\nto investigate, but rather only a failure to timely investigate or to discipline plaintiff’s fellow\n\nemployees. Regarding the August 2009 incident when Mr. Moreno yelled at plaintiff while she\n\nwas taking his deposition, plaintiff alleges not that PBCG failed to investigate this incident, but\n\nthat it “failed to take corrective action.” (Compl. ¶ 55.) Likewise, plaintiff admits that PBGC\n\ndid in fact investigate her April 2005 complaints regarding inappropriate emails. PBGC sent a\n\nmemo to all employees regarding inappropriate use of PBGC resources in June 2005. Plaintiff\n\nreceived this email. (Id. ¶¶ 28-29.) In connection with the investigation, PBGC hired an outside\n\nlaw firm in November 2005. (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiff cooperated with this investigation and provided\n\ninformation to the investigators. (Id.) The investigation concluded in February 2006 with a\n\ndetermination that no violation of PBGC workplace rules had occurred because the complained-\n\nof conduct was protected union activity.8 (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff received a letter informing her of\n\nthe outcome of this investigation. (Id.) At its essence, plaintiff’s allegation is not that PBGC\n\nfailed to conduct an investigation, but rather that she disagrees with the outcome of this\n\ninvestigation. This is not sufficient for plaintiff to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, and\n\ntherefore, her retaliation claims will be dismissed.\n\n                2.      Requesting Signature Acknowledging Receipt of Memorandum\n\n\n\n\n8\n The extent of internecine union warfare at PBGC is well documented in various cases in this\nCourt. See, e.g., Anderson v. International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers,\nNo. 10-0895 (D.D.C. filed May 28, 2010); Baird v. Holway, No. 10-0572 (D.D.C. filed April 9,\n2010); Baird v. Holway, 539 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D.D.C. 2008); Johnson v. Holway, 439 F. Supp. 2d.\n180 (D.D.C. 2006).\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\f       Plaintiff also claims she was retaliated against when defendant sought to obtain her\n\nsignature acknowledging that she had received a memorandum sent to all PBGC employees\n\nregarding the “Inappropriate use of PBGC Resources.” (Compl. ¶¶ 28-29.) Although the\n\ndefinition of “adverse action” for retaliation claims is more expansive than for discrimination\n\nclaims, a plaintiff must still be able to point to some action that a “reasonable employee would\n\nhave found . . . materially adverse.” Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68. Here, plaintiff does not allege\n\nthat she was disciplined, threatened with discipline, or otherwise suffered objective harm as a\n\nresult of being asked to sign a document acknowledging that she had received a prior\n\nmemorandum. Since plaintiff does not allege any adverse consequence, much less a “materially\n\nadverse” consequence that resulted from the request, no reasonable juror could find such a\n\nrequest would “deter a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination.” Id.; see also id. at 67 (“The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not\n\nfrom all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.”). Accordingly,\n\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss this claim will be granted.\n\n       C.      Hostile Work Environment\n\n       Plaintiff claims she has made out a claim for hostile work environment based on race,\n\nsex, and retaliation9 based on PBGC’s failure to take appropriate corrective action in response to\n\nan environment where “employees felt free to disseminate inflammatory, defamatory, libelous,\n\nand intimidating emails and to make unfounded, harmful allegations about Plaintiff to others as\n\n\n\n\n9\n Although hostile work environment claims based on retaliation are not as common as those\nbased on race or gender, they are legally cognizable. See Hussain v. Nicholson, 435 F.3d 359,\n366 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“In this circuit, a hostile work environment can amount to retaliation under\nTitle VII.”).\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fwell as verbally assault, physically intimidate, harass and otherwise mistreat Plaintiff without\n\nfear of management intervention and censure.”10 (Compl. ¶¶ 67, 76, 85.)\n\n       As explained above, plaintiff’s hostile work environment claims based on EEO\n\ncomplaints 08-03, 09-02, 09-06, 06-09/07-01 (consolidated), FC-006-2010, and FC-010-2010 are\n\ndismissed for failure to exhaust or to bring a timely civil action. Furthermore, to the extent\n\nplaintiff is alleging a hostile work environment based upon the underlying harassment that she\n\nclaims PBGC failed to adequately investigate or take corrective action in response to, these\n\nclaims must also be dismissed, as plaintiff does not allege that this underlying behavior (as\n\nopposed to defendant’s response to this behavior) was due to plaintiff’s race, sex, or activity\n\nprotected under Title VII. Franklin, 600 F. Supp. 2d at 76 (“Title VII only prohibit[s]\n\nworkplace harassment based on a person’s membership in a protected class or participation in\n\nprotected activity.”); Na’Im v. Clinton, 626 F. Supp. 2d 63, 73 (D.D.C. 2009) (“Courts in this\n\njurisdiction have routinely held that hostile behavior, no matter how unjustified or egregious,\n\ncannot support a claim of hostile work environment unless there exists some linkage between the\n\nhostile behavior and the plaintiff's membership in a protected class.”).\n\n       As a result, what remains is a claim of hostile work environment based on the following\n\nallegations—the PBGC failed to adequately investigate her complaints in April 2005 that she\n\nwas the subject of a number of insulting emails attacking her as “psychotic”; failed to investigate\n\nher complaint in January 2007 that opposing counsel representing the agency in plaintiff’s union\n\ngrievance sent an email stating that plaintiff experienced “litigation induced hallucinations”;\n\nfailed to take corrective action when Mr. Moreno yelled at her during a deposition; sought to\n10\n  Plaintiff does not attempt to segregate those events she claims constitute a hostile work\nenvironment from discrete acts of discrimination and/or retaliation. Counts II, IV, and VI\nincorporate by reference all of the acts described in the complaint, lumping them all together for\npurposes of alleging a hostile work environment.\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fobtain her signature acknowledging that she had received a memorandum sent to all PBGC\n\nemployees regarding the “Inappropriate use of PBGC Resources”; and failed to investigate her\n\ncomplaint that such a signature was requested from her. (Compl. ¶¶ 27-31, 33, 37, 55.) Plaintiff\n\nalso claims that defendant took these steps based on its desire to retaliate against her for her prior\n\nand ongoing EEO activities, and that PBGC promptly responded to complaints by similarly\n\nsituated white and male employees. (Id. ¶¶ 69, 77, 86.)\n\n       To establish a claim of a hostile work environment, “a plaintiff must show that his\n\nemployer subjected him to ‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult’ that is ‘sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive\n\nworking environment.’” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1201 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S.\n\n17, 21 (1993) (internal citation omitted)); accord Pantazes v. Jackson, 366 F. Supp. 2d 57, 71\n\n(D.D.C. 2005) (quoting Harris). To determine whether a hostile work environment exists, courts\n\nshould consider “the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory\n\nconduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether it interferes with an employee’s work\n\nperformance.” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1201. Plaintiff cannot satisfy this test, because none of the\n\nacts that she alleges, whether considered alone or cumulatively, meets “the demanding\n\nstandards” for a hostile work environment claim. Sewell, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 141-42.\n\n       Plaintiff misunderstands the nature of a hostile work environment claim. It is not a cause\n\nof action for the “ordinary tribulations of the workplace,” Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524\n\nU.S. 775, 788 (1998), and “[n]ot everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable\n\nadverse action.” Broderick v. Donaldson, 437 F.3d 1226, 1233 (D.C. Cir. 2006). In fact, even\n\nwhen abusive behavior is “‘motivated by discriminatory animus,’” it may not be actionable.\n\nStewart v. Evans, 275 F.3d 1126, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting Barbour, 181 F.3d at 1347).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fThe conduct complained of “must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions\n\nof employment.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (emphasis added). This standard is designed to be\n\n“sufficiently demanding” so that anti-discrimination statutes do not become “‘general civility\n\ncode[s].’” Id. (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80). See also Vickers v. Powell, 493 F.3d 186, 198-\n\n201 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (noting that district court correctly concluded that hostile work environment\n\nwas not created solely by three incidents that involved being “singled out for a requirement to\n\nprovide inordinate amounts of medical information to support requests for leave,” poor\n\nperformance evaluations, supervisor’s “angry threats,” and derogatory comments about\n\nminorities).\n\n       In short, the acts that plaintiff complains about are simply not the type of “discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult’ that are ‘sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions\n\nof [her] employment and create an abusive working environment.’” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1201\n\n(quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21).\n\n       Moreover, plaintiff cannot rely on the discrete acts upon which she bases her\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims to support her hostile work environment claim. “Because\n\nplaintiff’s allegedly ‘hostile’ events ‘are the very employment actions [s]he claims are\n\nretaliatory[,] [s]he cannot so easily bootstrap alleged retaliatory incidents into a broader hostile\n\nwork environment claim.’” Franklin, 600 F. Supp. 2d at 76 (quoting Keeley, 391 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n51); accord Smith v. Jackson, 539 F. Supp. 2d 116, 138 (D.D.C. 2008) (“[I]nsofar as Plaintiff\n\nattempts to base his hostile work environment claim on his [compressed work schedule]\n\nrevocation and AWOL charge, he cannot simply regurgitate his disparate treatment claims in an\n\neffort to flesh out a hostile work environment claim.”). “Cobbling together a number of distinct,\n\ndisparate acts will not create a hostile work environment, because ‘[d]iscrete acts constituting\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fdiscrimination or retaliation claims . . . are different in kind from a hostile work environment\n\nclaim . . . .’” Franklin, 600 F. Supp. 2d at 77 (quoting Lester v. Natsios, 290 F. Supp. 2d 11, 33\n\n(D.D.C. 2003)); accord Wada v. Tomlinson, 517 F. Supp. 2d 148, 211 (D.D.C. 2007), aff’d, 296\n\nF. App’x 77 (D.C. Cir. 2008). “‘[T]he dangers of allowing standard disparate treatment claims\n\nto be converted into a contemporaneous hostile work environment claim are apparent. Such an\n\naction would significantly blur the distinctions between both the elements that underpin each\n\ncause of action and the kinds of harm each cause of action was designed to address.’” Rattigan\n\nv. Gonzales, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 82 (quoting Parker v. State Dep’t of Pub. Safety, 11 F. Supp. 2d\n\n467, 475 (D. Del. 1998)).\n\n       Although plaintiff has described a workplace that was “hardly ideal, no reasonable jury\n\ncould find [that environment] ‘abusive’ . . . .” Hussain, 435 F.3d at 366 (citing Harris, 510 U.S.\n\nat 21-22). The Court will therefore grant defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts II, IV, and VI.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because the Court has found it unnecessary to\n\nconvert defendant’s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff’s motion\n\nfor discovery pursuant to Rule 56(f) is denied as moot.    A separate order accompanies this\n\nMemorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                                 /s/\n                                                      ELLEN SEGAL HUVELLE\n                                                      United States District Judge\n\nDate: October 13, 2010\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f",

Baird has sued her employer, claiming discrimination on the basis of\n\nher race and sex, retaliation for engaging in protected activity, and a hostile work environment in\n\nviolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Before the\n\nCourt is defendant’s motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. For the\n\nreasons set forth below, defendant’s motion will be granted.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\nI.     FACTUAL HISTORY\n\n       A.      Background\n\n       Plaintiff is an African-American female and is currently employed as an\n\nERISA/bankruptcy attorney in the Office of the Chief Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty\n\nCorporation (“PBGC”). (First Amended Complaint [“Compl.”] ¶¶ 4, 7.) Although appearing\n\npro se, plaintiff is an experienced litigant, having represented herself in numerous EEO\n\ncomplaints and civil actions, see, e.g., Anderson v. International Federation of Professional &\n\nTechnical Engineers, No. 10-0895 (D.D.C. filed May 28, 2010); Baird v. Holway, No. 10-0572\n\f(D.D.C. filed April 9, 2010); Baird v. Holway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2329762\"><a href=\"/opinion/2329762/baird-v-holway/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2008); Baird v.\n\nChao, No. 03-1759 (D.D.C. filed August 19, 2003), and having served as a representative for\n\nPBGC employees with respect to their EEO complaints. (See Compl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff was also an\n\nactive member of the union at PBGC, NAGE Local R3-77, and she served as union president\n\nfrom April 2007 until its dissolution in early 2009. (Id. ¶¶ 38, 51.)\n\n        On October 2, 2002, plaintiff filed a formal EEO complaint against PBGC to redress\n\nworkplace concerns in her department. (Id. ¶ 9.) Thereafter, on November 13, 2002, plaintiff\n\nclaims that she was accosted by a supervisor in her department. (Id.) She filed a grievance with\n\nher department, the Office of General Counsel (“OGC”), regarding the incident, accusing PBGC\n\nof failing to investigate and to take action to correct the behavior. (Id. ¶ 11.) The dispute went\n\nto arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, and the arbitrator ruled in her favor in\n\n2005. (Id. ¶¶ 11, 18-20.) PBGC appealed the arbitrator’s decision in 2008 (id. ¶ 22), which was\n\nupheld by the Federal Labor Relations Authority on April 28, 2010. (Dkt. #20.) While the\n\nsubject of this arbitration is not before the Court, plaintiff claims this incident constitutes\n\nrelevant evidence, as well as protected activity for purposes of plaintiff’s retaliation claims.\n\n        B.      2005 EEO Complaint (Agency No. 05-12)\n\n        In spring 2005, two of plaintiff’s co-workers at PBGC, Robert Perry and Dwayne Jeffers,\n\nconcluded that plaintiff had disseminated flyers throughout the workplace that accused them of\n\ntriggering a PBGC scan of its email system, which led to the firing and disciplining of several\n\nemployees. (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) In response, Mr. Jeffers began sending emails to other PBGC\n\nemployees calling plaintiff “psychotic.” (Id. ¶ 26.) On April 8, 2005, plaintiff filed several\n\ncomplaints with PBGC’s Human Resources Department (“HRD”) regarding these emails. (Id.\n\n¶ 27.) On June 16, 2005, PBGC sent an email to all employees regarding “Inappropriate use of\n\nPBGC Resources.” (Id. ¶ 28.) HRD official Richard Lattimer sent a subordinate to obtain\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fplaintiff’s signature acknowledging that she had received this email. (Id.) Mr. Lattimer\n\nrequested this signature only from plaintiff and two other employees. (Id.) Plaintiff refused to\n\nsign the acknowledgment, believing it to be retaliatory. (Id.) The plaintiff’s supervisor was\n\ncontacted, and a meeting was held for the purpose of obtaining plaintiff’s acknowledgment of\n\nreceipt of the email. (Id. ¶ 29.) At the meeting, an HRD official alleged that plaintiff had\n\ndisseminated the flyers mentioned above. (Id.) Plaintiff reported this incident to PBGC, but\n\naccording to her, PBGC failed to respond. (Id. ¶ 30.) In August 2005, plaintiff filed formal EEO\n\ncomplaint No. 05-12 challenging PBGC’s failure to investigate her complaints. (Id. ¶¶ 27, 30.)\n\nThereafter, in November 2005, PBGC hired the law firm of Littler Mendelson to conduct an\n\ninvestigation into, among other things, plaintiff’s complaints relating to the dissemination of\n\ninappropriate information in the workplace. (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiff cooperated with this\n\ninvestigation and was informed in February 2006 that Litter Mendelson had found no violation\n\nof PBGC workplace rules because the conduct complained of constituted protected union\n\nactivity. (Id. ¶¶ 31, 33.)\n\n        C.      2006 EEO Complaints (Agency Nos. 06-09 and 07-01)\n\n        On April 10, 2006, plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint No. 06-09 alleging\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex and reprisal on the grounds that the agency had failed to\n\npromptly respond to her complaints, allowed medical and personal information to be\n\ndisseminated by her union representative, blocked her email messages to her union\n\nrepresentative and a witness in the arbitration, and sought to sanction her. Baird v. Snowbarger,\n\nEEOC Appeal No. 0120072177, Agency Nos. 06-09 and 07-01 (July 10, 2009). On October 16,\n\n2006, plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint 07-01 alleging that PBGC’s EEO office improperly\n\nrecommended dismissal of her 2005 EEO complaint. Id. PBGC consolidated these two\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fcomplaints and dismissed them, and the EEOC affirmed the agency’s dismissal on July 10, 2009.\n\nId.\n\n       D.      2007 EEO Complaint (Agency No. 07-06)\n\n       On January 11, 2007, Raymond Forster, the primary OGC attorney who represented\n\nPBGC in plaintiff’s union arbitration, sent an email to several PBGC employees advising the\n\n“11th floor OGC staff in the area of conference room 11E to use caution about what they say in\n\nhalls or open offices,” for “[c]ertain people who will be in 11E have a way of twisting and\n\npublicizing their litigation induced hallucinations.” (Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss or,\n\nAlternatively, for Summary Judgment [“Def.’s Mot.”] Ex. 3; Compl. ¶ 36.) Plaintiff reported the\n\nemail to HRD, but according to plaintiff, defendant did not investigate the matter and did not\n\ntake disciplinary action against Forster. (Id. ¶ 37.) Plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint No. 07-\n\n06 in connection with this matter on February 12, 2007. (Def.’s Mot. Ex. 3.) PBGC’s EEO\n\noffice accepted the complaint for investigation on June 15, 2007, and the investigation was\n\ncompleted on April 1, 2008. (Id.) Plaintiff requested a hearing before the EEOC on May 9,\n\n2008, but filed this action prior to a final EEOC decision. (Id. Exs. 31-32.)\n\n       E.      EEO Complaints Nos. 09-02 and 09-06\n\n       On October 9, 2008, plaintiff filed yet another EEO complaint, No. 09-02, in which she\n\nalleged that she was subjected to race discrimination, reprisal, and a hostile work environment\n\nfor “winning a liability decision finding unlawful retaliation by labor management staff of PBGC\n\nin 2005 & 2008 . . . filing EEO complaints and civil action against PBGC, and representing\n\nemployees in EEO matters from 2002-2008.” (Id. Ex. 21.) Plaintiff filed formal EEO complaint\n\nNo. 09-06 on similar grounds on February 23, 2009. (Id. Ex 22.) In these complaints, plaintiff\n\nalleged, inter alia, that PBGC “attacked her law license” and assigned her non-EEO work so that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fshe would not have sufficient time to work on EEO matters. (Id. Exs. 21-22.) Final\n\nadministrative action in these complaints occurred on April 28, 2009. (Id. Ex. 23.)\n\n          F.     EEO Complaint No. 08-03\n\n          Plaintiff filed EEO complaint No. 08-03 on November 29, 2007, alleging discrimination,\n\nretaliation, and hostile work environment when, in her capacity as union president, she engaged\n\nin several union activities, prompting adverse responses by agency management. Baird v.\n\nMillard, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083045, Agency No. 0803 (Nov. 7, 2008). The agency\n\ndismissed the complaint on May 20, 2008, and the EEOC affirmed this dismissal on November\n\n5, 2008. Id.\n\n          G.     EEO Complaint No. FC-001-2010\n\n          In August 2009, plaintiff, in her capacity as counsel for fellow employee Richard\n\nAnderson, was deposing Ruben Moreno, an HRD labor management official, in Mr. Anderson’s\n\nEEO action. (Compl. ¶ 55.) PBGC attorney Scott Schwartz was also present. (Id.) During a\n\nbreak in the deposition, Mr. Moreno began angrily yelling at plaintiff and pounding the table.\n\n(Id.) Plaintiff reported this incident to PBGC officials, who did not, in her view, take corrective\n\naction. (Id.)

Furthermore, plaintiff alleges that PBGC’s “intentional failure” to\n\n“investigate or take appropriate corrective action” in response to her complaints created a hostile\n\nwork environment. (Id.)\n\n        As an initial matter, the Court must note that plaintiff appears to be proceeding on the\n\nfundamental misunderstanding that under Title VII, “[d]efendant is obligated to respond to\n\ncomplaints and take corrective action where warranted to ensure Plaintiff has a ‘positive and\n\nproductive work environment.’” (Pl.’s Opp. at 21 (citing PBGC “workplace rules”) (emphasis\n\nadded); see id. at 22 (“Defendant has repeatedly failed to apply its workplace rules to protect the\n\nPlaintiff in the workplace, violating its own policy . . . .”).)

Therefore, to the extent that plaintiff attempts to utilize Title VII to create a\n\nfederal cause of action for violations of PBGC’s internal rules and policies, her claims fail as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n        A.       Disparate Treatment\n\n        Defendant argues that plaintiff’s remaining disparate treatment claims must be dismissed\n\nbecause the alleged acts do not constitute “adverse employment action[s]” under Title VII.\n\n(Def.’s Mot. at 18-21.) Defendant challenges plaintiff’s allegations that the following were\n\nadverse actions: (1) the agency’s failure to conduct a timely and adequate investigation of her\n\ncomplaints of receiving inappropriate emails from other employees and from opposing counsel\n\n\n                                                   13\n\frepresenting the agency in plaintiff’s union grievance (Compl. ¶¶ 27, 30, 31, 33, 37); (2) PBGC’s\n\n“fail[ure] to take corrective action” in response to Ruben Moreno yelling at her while she was\n\ntaking his deposition in a co-worker’s EEO case (id. ¶ 55); and (3) PBGC’s selective attempt to\n\nobtain plaintiff’s signature acknowledging receipt of an email titled: “Inappropriate use of PBGC\n\nresources.” (Id. ¶ 28.)\n\n       To succeed on a claim of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff has the initial burden\n\nof establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that “(1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action\n\ngives rise to an inference of discrimination.” Stella v.

Failure to Investigate or Discipline Other Employees\n\n       Plaintiff claims that PBGC discriminated against her on the basis of her race and sex\n\nwhen it “fail[ed] to investigate complaints of highly inappropriate conduct towards her” (Compl.\n\n¶ 63), and “refused to grant [her] the conditions of employment she was entitled to” through the\n\napplication of, inter alia, PBGC’s workplace rules. (Id. ¶¶ 73, 81.) Specifically, plaintiff claims\n\nthat PBGC failed: (1) to adequately investigate her complaints in April 2005 that she was the\n\nsubject of a number of insulting emails attacking her as “psychotic”; (2) to investigate her\n\ncomplaint in January 2007 that Forster sent an email stating that plaintiff experienced “litigation\n\ninduced hallucinations”; and (3) to take corrective action when Moreno yelled at her during a\n\ndeposition. (Id. ¶¶ 27, 30, 31, 33, 37, 55.) Assuming the truth of these allegations, as the Court\n\nmust at this stage, plaintiff’s claims do not constitute adverse employment actions, and thus, she\n\ncannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Even if PBGC had failed to investigate\n\nplaintiff’s claims,5 this would not effect a “significant change” in plaintiff’s employment status,\n\n“such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.” Douglas, 559 F.3d at 552\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Requesting Signature Acknowledging Receipt of Memorandum\n\n       Plaintiff claims she was discriminated against when defendant sought to obtain her\n\nsignature acknowledging that she had received a memorandum sent to all PBGC employees\n\n5\n As the Court notes below, plaintiff admits that PBGC did in fact investigate several of her\ncomplaints, but failed to reach outcomes that were to her satisfaction.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fregarding the “Inappropriate use of PBGC Resources.” (Compl. ¶¶ 28-29.)

See Burlington, 548\n\nU.S. at 67 (“[T]he antiretaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but\n\nfrom retaliation that produces an injury or harm.”).

Regarding the August 2009 incident when Mr. Moreno yelled at plaintiff while she\n\nwas taking his deposition, plaintiff alleges not that PBCG failed to investigate this incident, but\n\nthat it “failed to take corrective action.” (Compl. ¶ 55.) Likewise, plaintiff admits that PBGC\n\ndid in fact investigate her April 2005 complaints regarding inappropriate emails. PBGC sent a\n\nmemo to all employees regarding inappropriate use of PBGC resources in June 2005. Plaintiff\n\nreceived this email. (Id. ¶¶ 28-29.) In connection with the investigation, PBGC hired an outside\n\nlaw firm in November 2005. (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiff cooperated with this investigation and provided\n\ninformation to the investigators. (Id.) The investigation concluded in February 2006 with a\n\ndetermination that no violation of PBGC workplace rules had occurred because the complained-\n\nof conduct was protected union activity.8 (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff received a letter informing her of\n\nthe outcome of this investigation. (Id.) At its essence, plaintiff’s allegation is not that PBGC\n\nfailed to conduct an investigation, but rather that she disagrees with the outcome of this\n\ninvestigation. This is not sufficient for plaintiff to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, and\n\ntherefore, her retaliation claims will be dismissed.\n\n                2.

Although the\n\ndefinition of “adverse action” for retaliation claims is more expansive than for discrimination\n\nclaims, a plaintiff must still be able to point to some action that a “reasonable employee would\n\nhave found . . . materially adverse.” Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68. Here, plaintiff does not allege\n\nthat she was disciplined, threatened with discipline, or otherwise suffered objective harm as a\n\nresult of being asked to sign a document acknowledging that she had received a prior\n\nmemorandum. Since plaintiff does not allege any adverse consequence, much less a “materially\n\nadverse” consequence that resulted from the request, no reasonable juror could find such a\n\nrequest would “deter a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination.” Id.; see also id. at 67 (“The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not\n\nfrom all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.”). Accordingly,\n\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss this claim will be granted.\n\n       C.      Hostile Work Environment\n\n       Plaintiff claims she has made out a claim for hostile work environment based on race,\n\nsex, and retaliation9 based on PBGC’s failure to take appropriate corrective action in response to\n\nan environment where “employees felt free to disseminate inflammatory, defamatory, libelous,\n\nand intimidating emails and to make unfounded, harmful allegations about Plaintiff to others as\n\n\n\n\n9\n Although hostile work environment claims based on retaliation are not as common as those\nbased on race or gender, they are legally cognizable.

Furthermore, to the extent\n\nplaintiff is alleging a hostile work environment based upon the underlying harassment that she\n\nclaims PBGC failed to adequately investigate or take corrective action in response to, these\n\nclaims must also be dismissed, as plaintiff does not allege that this underlying behavior (as\n\nopposed to defendant’s response to this behavior) was due to plaintiff’s race, sex, or activity\n\nprotected under Title VII.

(Compl. ¶¶ 27-31, 33, 37, 55.) Plaintiff\n\nalso claims that defendant took these steps based on its desire to retaliate against her for her prior\n\nand ongoing EEO activities, and that PBGC promptly responded to complaints by similarly\n\nsituated white and male employees. (Id. ¶¶ 69, 77, 86.)\n\n       To establish a claim of a hostile work environment, “a plaintiff must show that his\n\nemployer subjected him to ‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult’ that is ‘sufficiently\n\nsevere or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive\n\nworking environment.’” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1201 (quoting Harris v.

To determine whether a hostile work environment exists, courts\n\nshould consider “the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory\n\nconduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether it interferes with an employee’s work\n\nperformance.” Baloch, 550 F.3d at 1201. Plaintiff cannot satisfy this test, because none of the\n\nacts that she alleges, whether considered alone or cumulatively, meets “the demanding\n\nstandards” for a hostile work environment claim. Sewell, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 141-42.\n\n       Plaintiff misunderstands the nature of a hostile work environment claim.
