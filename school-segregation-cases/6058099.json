Officials believed that Steele was threatening other\ndetainees in order to coerce them into using Speedy and that\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fSteele was receiving some form of compensation from\nSpeedy for his efforts. After interviewing Steele and advising\nhim of the allegations against him, officials placed him in\nadministrative segregation while they continued to investigate\nhis conduct. During his time in segregation, Steele’s\ntelephone privileges were restricted to legal calls only.\n\n        Steele claims in this Section 1983 suit that the\nDefendant/Appellee MCACC officials violated his due\nprocess rights when they transferred him to administrative\nsegregation in the facility and restricted his phone privileges,\nwhich interfered with his ability to attempt to find a co-signer\nfor his own bail. The District Court granted summary\njudgment for all Defendants. For the reasons that follow, we\nwill affirm.\n\n              I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND1\n\n       On December 22, 2008, Steele was arrested for\nviolating a narcotics restraining order. He was then placed\ninto pretrial detention at MCACC. The next day, Steele’s bail\nwas set at $50,000, which he was unable to pay.\n\n       On February 23, 2009, while Steele remained in\ndetention at MCACC, Robert Gluck, a private attorney,\ncontacted MCACC Deputy Warden Masone about safety\nconcerns Gluck had for his client, another MCACC detainee.\nAccording to Gluck, Steele approached Gluck’s client and\nthreatened to disclose his client’s sex offense charges to\nMCACC’s general population if Gluck’s client did not use a\n\n       1\n         The parties have not disputed the facts outlined\nherein, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\fspecific bail bonds service, Speedy Bail Bonds. Gluck\nreported that Steele handed his client a document that listed\nhis client’s charges and bail amount. Gluck also faxed to\nMasone a copy of the document.\n\n       After obtaining this information from Gluck, Masone\nand Sergeant Paul De Amicis began an investigation of Steele\nand Speedy’s activities within MCACC. They interviewed\nGluck’s client, who confirmed that Steele threatened him and\nprovided him with a specific phone number to use to arrange\nhis bail. Masone and De Amicis confirmed that the phone\nnumber belonged to a Speedy office.\n\n        De Amicis continued the investigation by reviewing\nrecorded phone calls from the unit in which Steele was\nhoused. He found numerous calls between Steele and\nSpeedy, during which Steele referenced detainees’ names,\nidentification numbers, and the specific amounts of their\nbails. According to De Amicis, Steele bragged in some of\nthose phone conversations about “his ability to get other\ninmates to post bail using Speedy” and Steele “referred to\ncredit he expected to receive for bails he recruited for\nSpeedy.” App. 1312. Based on the results of the preliminary\ninvestigation, MCACC officials believed that Steele “was\nacting as an illegal agent for Speedy” and that he was\nreceiving some type of compensation from Speedy in\nexchange for his efforts to arrange detainees’ bails. App.\n1312.\n\n      MCACC officials met with Steele on February 25,\n2009, just two days after Gluck’s call, to discuss the\n\n\n\n\n                             5\n\fallegations.2 During the meeting, MCACC officials apprised\nSteele of a complaint they received that he had been “making\nmoney for the bail bondsmen,” “threatening inmates,” and\n“trying to get money out of [them].” App. 1303. Officials\nasked Steele to explain his actions with Speedy and permitted\nhim to respond to their questions. Steele admitted to helping\nother detainees arrange bails, but denied that he was receiving\nany compensation from Speedy. Steele stated that he was\narranging detainees’ bails with Speedy “out of the goodness\nof [his] heart.” App. 1305. As officials were meeting with\nSteele on February 25th, MCACC corrections officers\nsearched Steele’s cell and found materials that corroborated\nthe allegations against him. These materials included lists of\ndetainees’ names, bail amounts, and phone numbers of\ndetainees’ friends and relatives.\n\n      That same day, Steele was transferred to\nadministrative segregation.3 De Amicis averred that Steele\nwas placed in administrative segregation in order “to prevent\n\n       2\n         Sergeant De Amicis stated that the officials who\nattended the meeting were Warden Cicchi, Deputy Warden\nMasone, and De Amicis. According to Steele’s complaint,\nMasone, Defendant Captain Barth, and probably De Amicis\nattended the meeting. During his deposition, Steele stated\nthat Barth and Masone were the MCACC officials who\nattended the February 25th meeting.\n       3\n         On February 26, 2009, MCACC provided Steele with\na letter confirming his transfer to administrative segregation,\nwhich noted that the Classification Committee would review\nSteele’s status on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\n\n                              6\n\fhim from posing additional security risks in the [MCACC]\nand to allow further investigation into Speedy’s activities\nwithout [Steele’s] interference.” App. 1313. Later in the day\non February 25th, Masone and De Amicis met with\nemployees of Speedy, who confirmed that Steele was an\n“associate” who was recruiting other detainees to use Speedy\nfor their bail bonds. App. 1313. After further investigation,\nMCACC officials contacted the county prosecutor’s office\nand the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\n       The MCACC “Inmate Guidelines” manual (“the\nManual”), which served as a guide for inmate conduct and jail\nprocedures, contained a number of provisions addressing\ntelephone access at the facility. It provided that individuals\nhoused in the general population had open access to collect\ncall telephones for personal calls and were allowed an\nunlimited number of legal calls. It also provided that\nindividuals placed in “disciplinary lockup” were not\npermitted telephone access, with the exception of legal\ntelephone calls. App. 1345. The Manual did not address\ntelephone access for detainees housed in administrative\nsegregation.4     While he remained in administrative\nsegregation, Steele was permitted only to make legal calls,\nthrough the MCACC social work office.\n\n      4\n         The New Jersey Department of Corrections’ 1999\n“Handbook for Discipline for Inmates” was appended to the\nManual. The Handbook addressed telephone access for\ninmates placed in Administrative Segregation. However, the\nHandbook stated that it applied only to state-sentenced\ninmates. Steele has not argued on appeal that the Handbook\napplied to him; his arguments center on the MCACC’s own\ninternal Manual.\n\n\n\n\n                              7\n\f       On March 5, 2009, Steele’s bail was reduced from\n$50,000 to $2,500. Thereafter, Steele made three attempts to\ncontact his attorney to help him obtain a co-signer for his bail.\nSteele reached the attorney’s secretary twice, and made\ncontact with his lawyer on his third attempt. On March 20,\n2009, Steele’s bail was posted and he was released.\n\n              II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Steele originally filed this action pro se in July 2009 in\nthe United States District Court for the District of New\nJersey. The operative Amended Complaint was filed pro se\nin May 2012. In his Amended Complaint, Steele asserted\nseveral claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983: violations of his First,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n       In December 2013, after five rounds of summary\njudgment motions, the District Court granted summary\njudgment to Defendants as to Steele’s First and Eighth\nAmendment claims. The Court denied summary judgment as\nto Steele’s claims under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, but permitted Defendants to move\nfor summary judgment again on those claims in January\n2014. In May 2014, the District Court granted summary\njudgment to all Defendants on Steele’s Fourteenth\nAmendment claims, holding that they did not violate Steele’s\nrights under the substantive and procedural components of the\nDue Process Clause. Steele filed this timely appeal.5\n\n\n       5\n         This Court granted Steele appointment of counsel for\nhis appeal. He does not challenge the District Court’s\ndisposition of his First and Eighth Amendment claims.\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\f   III. JURISDICTION & STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction over this Section\n1983 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have\njurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate where the moving\nparty carries its burden to establish that “there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “We\nreview an award of summary judgment de novo, applying the\nsame test on review that the District Court should have\napplied.” MBIA Ins. Corp. v. Royal Indem. Co., 426 F.3d\n204, 209 (3d Cir. 2005). That is, we review “the facts in the\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all\ninferences in that party’s favor.” Burns v. PA Dep’t of Corr.,\n642 F.3d 163, 170 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Armbruster v.\nUnisys Corp., 32 F.3d 768, 777 (3d Cir. 1994)).\n\n                     IV. DISCUSSION\n\n       The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nprohibits states from “depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty,\nor property, without due process of law,” U.S. Const. amend.\nXIV, and contains both substantive and procedural\ncomponents, Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845-\n46 (1998). Steele claims that Defendants violated both\ncomponents, which we address in turn below.\n\n                A. Substantive Due Process\n\n      “The substantive component of the Due Process\nClause limits what government may do regardless of the\n\n\n\n\n                              9\n\ffairness of procedures that it employs,” Boyanowski v.\nCapital Area Intermediate Unit, 215 F.3d 396, 399 (3d Cir.\n2000), in order to “guarantee protect[ion] against government\npower arbitrarily and oppressively exercised,” Lewis, 523\nU.S. at 846 (citing Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331\n(1986)). To maintain a substantive due process claim, Steele\nmust have been deprived of a particular interest that “is\nprotected by the substantive due process clause.” Chainey v.\nStreet, 523 F.3d 200, 219 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n       Steele claims that Defendants’ actions infringed on\nfour separate liberty interests.       First, he asserts that\nDefendants interfered with his “constitutionally-protected\nliberty interest” in “posting bail once his bail was set.”6 Br.\nof Appellant 16 (capitalization omitted). Second, Steele\nargues that by placing him in administrative segregation,\nDefendants interfered with his constitutional liberty interest in\navoiding punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt. Third,\nSteele contends that Defendants interfered with his “state-\ncreated liberty interest[]” in accessing the telephones at\nMCACC, an interest that Steele argues was created by the\nMCACC Manual. Br. of Appellant 24. Fourth, Steele argues\nthat his administrative segregation violated his “state-created\nliberty interest in remaining part of the general prison\npopulation.” Suppl. Br. of Appellant 1-2.\n\n      As an initial matter, Steele cannot proceed on his third\nand fourth claimed liberty interests, because substantive due\n\n       6\n         To be clear, Steele claims a liberty interest in\nexercising his bail option using funds already available to\nhim. His claim does not touch on issues relating to the\namount of his bail or his ability to pay.\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fprocess claims do not arise out of state-created liberty\ninterests. In contrast to procedural due process rights, which\nmay be derived from state law, “[s]ubstantive due process\nrights are founded not upon state law but upon deeply rooted\nnotions of fundamental personal interests derived from the\nConstitution.” Nunez v. Pachman, 578 F.3d 228, 233 (3d Cir.\n2009) (quoting Nilson v. Layton City, 45 F.3d 369, 372 (10th\nCir. 1999)); see also Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474\nU.S. 214, 229 (1985) (Powell, J., concurring) (explaining that\nprocedural due process protects certain interests even though\nthose interests are “derived from state law rather than the\nConstitution,” but “substantive due process rights are created\nonly by the Constitution”). Therefore, as we examine\nSteele’s substantive due process claims here, we consider\nonly Steele’s two claimed constitutionally protected liberty\ninterests, which are themselves interrelated. These are: (1)\nexercising his bail option once his bail was set, and (2)\nremaining free from punishment before an adjudication of\nguilt.7\n\n                   1. Exercising bail option\n\n      There is no dispute between the parties that Steele had\na constitutionally protected liberty interest in exercising his\n\n       7\n          The District Court addressed Steele’s allegations\nregarding bail access only insofar as they related to the\nquestion of whether his transfer to administrative\nsegregation amounted to unconstitutional punishment.\nBecause we understand Steele to advance these as two\nfactually intertwined but legally independent substantive due\nprocess claims, we will address each separately.\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\fbail option, once bail had been set, sufficient to trigger\nsubstantive due process protection. We agree. Such a right\nemanates from the liberties “at the heart” of the Due Process\nClause: the freedom “from government custody, detention, or\nother forms of physical restraint” prior to any determination\nof guilt. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001); see\nalso Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992) (“Freedom\nfrom bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty\nprotected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary\ngovernmental action.”). The Supreme Court has explained\nthat an arrestee’s right to freedom from pretrial detention is\nsubordinated to other interests only in specific circumstances\n– particularly where there has been an adjudication that\ndetention is necessary because an “arrestee presents an\nidentified and articulable threat to an individual or the\ncommunity,” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750-51\n(1987), or to “ensure [an arrestee’s] presence at trial,” Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 523 (1979). But those circumstances\ndo not exist in a case like this one, where there has already\nbeen a judicial determination that an arrestee is eligible for\nrelease on bail and bail has been set for that arrestee.\n\n        Other Circuits acknowledge that substantive due\nprocess protection of this liberty interest attaches once\narrestees are deemed eligible for release on bail. For\ninstance, in Dodds v. Richardson, the Tenth Circuit explained\nthat “an arrestee obtains a liberty interest in being freed of\ndetention once his bail is set because the setting of bail\naccepts the security of the bond for the arrestee’s appearance\nat trial.” 614 F.3d 1185, 1192 (10th Cir. 2010). Likewise,\nthe Eleventh Circuit held in Campbell v. Johnson that “[t]he\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause includes the right\nto be free from continued detention after it was or should\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fhave been known that the detainee was entitled to release.”\n586 F.3d 835, 840 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, we conclude that Steele had a\nprotected liberty interest in exercising his bail option once his\nbail was set.\n\n        Having established that his asserted liberty interest is\nprotected by substantive due process, Steele must also show\nthat “the government’s deprivation of that protected interest\nshocks the conscience.” Chainey, 523 F.3d at 219. The\nSupreme Court has instructed that we must apply the “shocks\nthe conscience” standard where, as here, the challenged\ngovernment action is executive in nature rather than\nlegislative.8 See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 845-47. “[T]he exact\ndegree of wrongfulness necessary to reach the ‘conscience-\nshocking’ level” will “depend[] upon the circumstances of a\nparticular case,” and may range from “deliberate\nindifference” to “actual intent to cause harm.” Vargas v. City\nof Phila., 783 F.3d 962, 973 (3d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We cannot say that Defendants’ actions here\namount to even deliberate indifference.\n\n       MCACC officials permitted Steele, during his time in\nadministrative segregation, to make calls to his attorney to\narrange for bail. Indeed, Steele made three such phone calls\nto his attorney’s office, through the MCACC social work\n\n       8\n         Where the government infringes on a plaintiff’s right\nthrough legislative activity, by contrast, the Supreme Court\nhas explained that we must determine whether the legislation\nat issue is “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\ninterest.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721\n(1997).\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\foffice, beginning the day after Steele’s bail was reduced from\n$50,000 to $2,500. Steele offered no evidence that MCACC\nstaff prevented or inhibited him from attempting to contact\nhis attorney via phone. Steele also offered nothing to suggest\nthat his attorney was ill-equipped to assist Steele with\narranging bail. In addition, Steele’s access to mail was not\nrestricted during his time in segregation. In short, though\nMCACC officials curtailed Steele’s unlimited, non-legal\nphone privileges during his administrative segregation,\nofficials preserved two key channels of communication\nthrough which Steele could attempt to secure his bail while in\nsegregation.\n\n        Steele’s circumstances are distinguishable from the\narrestees’ circumstances in Dodds and Campbell. In Dodds,\nafter a judge set the plaintiff-arrestee’s bond, two individuals\nasked employees at the jail where the plaintiff was housed\nabout posting bond on the plaintiff’s behalf. Dodds, 614 F.3d\nat 1189-90. Those individuals were told in response by jail\nemployees that bond would not be accepted before the\nplaintiff was arraigned by a judge, consistent with local\npolicies. Id. The Tenth Circuit concluded that evidence\nshowing the defendants’ policies “prevented felony arrestees\nwhose bail had been set from posting bail after hours and\nbefore arraignment” was sufficient to overcome summary\njudgment on plaintiff’s due process claim. Id. at 1206\n(emphasis added).\n\n        In Campbell, jail administrators refused to accept\ncourt-approved real estate documents as security for the\nplaintiff-arrestee’s bail for months after his bail was set.\nCampbell, 586 F.3d at 838-39. The Eleventh Circuit found\nthis evidence sufficient to overcome summary judgment on\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\fthe plaintiff’s due process claim. Id. at 840-42; see also\nGaylor v. Does, 105 F.3d 572 (10th Cir. 1997) (reversing\ngrant of summary judgment for defendants on plaintiff-\narrestee’s due process claim, where bail was set but was never\ncommunicated to the plaintiff or other individuals inquiring\nabout it).     Officials’ actions in Dodds and Campbell\nunreasonably inhibited, and essentially prevented, the\nplaintiffs from exercising their bail options after bail was set.\nOn the record before us, we cannot say that MCACC officials\nput Steele in the same predicament.\n\n        At bottom, we cannot agree with Steele’s argument\nthat in the specific circumstances of this case substantive due\nprocess required Defendants to provide Steele with unlimited,\nnon-legal telephone privileges during his time in\nadministrative segregation so that he could attempt to find a\nco-signer for his bail and exercise his bail option.9\n\n       9\n            Precedent addressing various constitutional\nprotections of telephone access in detention settings informs\nand is consistent with our decision here. See, e.g., Valdez v.\nRosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1042-43, 1047 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(restricting telephone access of detainee placed in\nadministrative segregation to one legal telephone call per day\ndid not violate plaintiff’s substantive due process rights);\nWashington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1100 (6th Cir. 1994)\n(explaining that inmates do not have a constitutional right to\nunlimited telephone use); Benzel v. Grammer, 869 F.2d 1105,\n1108 (8th Cir. 1989) (noting that inmates do not have a right\nto unlimited telephone use, and telephone communication\nwith relatives and friends may be restricted “in a reasonable\nmanner”); Martin v. Tyson, 845 F.2d 1451, 1458 (7th Cir.\n1988) (holding that it did not violate the Due Process Clause\n\n\n\n\n                               15\n\fDefendants’ limitation of Steele’s phone privileges did not\n“shock the conscience,” and therefore, Steele’s claim that\nDefendants violated his due process right to exercise his bail\noption fails.10\n\n\nto limit pretrial detainees’ non-legal calls); Strandberg v. City\nof Helena, 791 F.2d 744, 747 (9th Cir. 1986) (stating that\ndetainees’ and inmates’ constitutional right to telephone\naccess is “subject to rational limitations in the face of\nlegitimate security interests of the penal institution” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n       10\n         In their briefing, the parties apply the Bell v. Wolfish\n“punishment” framework, discussed in greater detail in\nSection IV(A)(2), infra, to Steele’s bail claim. The District\nCourt also applied the Bell framework to Steele’s claims in its\nsummary judgment opinion. But we do not find Bell to be\nsquarely applicable to Steele’s claim.\n\n        The Supreme Court in Bell explained that it was not\naddressing “the curtailment of liberty” resulting from the\n“decision to detain an accused.” 441 U.S. at 533-34, 541.\nRather, the Court was addressing specific conditions of\npretrial confinement, such as double-bunking of detainees,\nwhich were “aspect[s] of pretrial detention” that did not\nviolate other constitutional guarantees. Id. In this Circuit, we\nhave applied Bell to address a range of conditions of pretrial\ndetention, such as strip searches, Florence v. Bd. of Chosen\nFreeholders of Cty. of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir.\n2010); triple-celling, Hubbard v. Taylor, 538 F.3d 229 (3d\nCir. 2008); and placement in isolation, Stevenson v. Carroll,\n495 F.3d 62 (3d Cir. 2007). Other Circuits similarly have\napplied Bell to address conditions such as strip searches, Byrd\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f                2. Freedom from punishment\n\n        Steele also claims that his placement in administrative\nsegregation violated his substantive due process right to be\nfree from punishment. Under the analytical framework\nestablished in Bell, detention officials’ restrictions on pretrial\ndetainees will constitute punishment prohibited by the Due\nProcess Clause when: (1) “there is a showing of express\nintent to punish on the part of [those] [] officials”; (2) “the\nrestriction or condition is not rationally related to a legitimate\nnon-punitive government purpose,” i.e., “if it is arbitrary or\npurposeless”; or (3) “the restriction is excessive in light of\nthat purpose.” Stevenson, 495 F.3d at 67-68 (quoting Rapier,\n172 F.3d at 1005). Of these three possible means to establish\npunishment, Steele asserts only the second and third; he has\nnot argued in his briefing that such an intent to punish was\nexpress in nature.\n\n\nv. Maricopa Cty. Sheriff’s Dept., 629 F.3d 1135 (9th Cir.\n2011); and solitary confinement, Rapier v. Harris, 172 F.3d\n999 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n        Steele’s bail claim, however, challenges more than\nconditions of his pretrial detention. He challenges the\ncurtailment of a separate and independent liberty interest that\narose from his pretrial detention: his right to be freed from\nthat detention, by exercising his bail option, once his bail was\nset. This claim fits awkwardly into the Bell framework, and\nmore comfortably into the general “shocks the conscience”\nsubstantive due process framework applicable to executive\nactions. Nevertheless, for many of the same reasons provided\nin Section IV(A)(2), infra, Steele’s bail claim would fare no\nbetter under Bell.\n\n\n\n\n                               17\n\f       The term “punishment” in this context warrants further\nexplanation. “Punishment,” as used in Bell, refers to the\npunishment of a pretrial detainee for his alleged criminal\nconduct, committed prior to his detention, for which he has\nnot yet been convicted. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535-36. The\nSupreme Court explained that this type of “punishment” is\nprohibited by the Due Process Clause because the detainee\n“ha[d] not been adjudged guilty of any crime” and “had only\na ‘judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to\n[the] extended restraint of [his] liberty following arrest.’” Id.\nat 536-37 (quoting Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114\n(1975)). Bell did not concern the type of “punishment” or\ndiscipline alleged in this case: punishment of a detainee for\nhis in-facility conduct that might violate the facility’s rules\nand policies. Despite the apparent distinctions between Bell\nand cases where a detainee claims that he was “punished” for\nhis in-facility conduct, we agree with the First Circuit’s\ndetermination in Collazo-Leon v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons that\nthe “theoretical constitutional premises of Bell’s analysis\nprovides some rational guidance” for evaluating claims\ninvolving in-facility conduct that could\nwarrant disciplinary action.11 51 F.3d 315, 317-18 (1st Cir.\n1995).\n\n\n11\n     The First Circuit explained in Collazo-Leon,\n\n                [o]n the authority of Bell, it may\n                be divined that even if a\n                restriction or condition may be\n                viewed as having a punitive effect\n                on the pretrial detainee, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                18\n\f        With that understanding, we turn to the question of\nwhether Defendants had a “legitimate governmental\nobjective” in transferring Steele to administrative segregation\nin this case. Steele argues that his segregation did not serve\nany rational purpose other than punishment. Viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to Steele, as we must, we\ncannot agree that Steele has presented evidence sufficient to\ncreate a genuine dispute of material fact on this issue. The\nrecord shows that Steele was placed into administrative\nsegregation for internal security reasons.\n\n        The Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that\nmaintaining internal security and order in jails and prisons are\n“legitimate governmental objectives” and that courts must\ngive prison officials considerable discretion to manage\n\n\n              nonetheless constitutional if it\n              also furthers\n              some legitimate governmental\n              objective such as addressing a\n              specific institutional violation and\n              is not excessive in light of the\n              seriousness of the violation. . . . If\n              there is a reasonable relation\n              between the sanctions and\n              legitimate institutional policies, an\n              intent to punish the detainee for\n              prior unproven criminal conduct\n              cannot be inferred.\n\n51 F.3d at 318.\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\finternal security in their institutions. See, e.g., Sandin v.\nConner, 515 U.S. 472, 482-83 (1995) (“[F]ederal courts\nought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility to state\nofficials trying to manage a volatile environment.”); Hewitt v.\nHelms, 459 U.S. 460, 472 (1983) (“Prison administrators . . .\nshould be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption\nand execution of policies and practices that in their judgment\nare needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to\nmaintain institutional security.” (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at\n547)), receded from on other grounds by Sandin, 515 U.S. at\n482-83; Bell, 441 U.S. at 561 (“Ensuring security and order at\nthe institution is a permissible non-punitive objective,\nwhether the facility houses pretrial detainees, convicted\ninmates, or both.”). Courts must afford such deference\nbecause “assessing the seriousness of a threat” requires\nofficials to do more than simply take stock of the “specific\nfacts surrounding a particular incident; instead, they must\nconsider the character of the inmates confined in the\ninstitution, recent and longstanding relations between\nprisoners and guards, prisoners inter se, and the like.”\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 474.\n\n       Of course, officials’ discretion is not unbridled. They\ncannot insulate themselves from liability under the Due\nProcess Clause by mechanically citing to broad internal\nsecurity interests, regardless of how insignificant or unlikely\nto occur a particular threat might be. But the record before us\nsuggests that the threat posed to internal security by Steele’s\nconduct was legitimate and ongoing. MCACC officials had\nevidence that Steele was conducting an illegal bail bonds\nscheme with Speedy over the phone. They also believed that\nSteele’s actions endangered other detainees in the facility\nbecause Steele was threatening to disclose detainees’ charges\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\fto the general MCACC population if those detainees did not\nuse Speedy’s service.12         So Steele “was placed in\nadministrative segregation . . . to prevent him from posing\nany additional security risks in the facility,” and to allow for\ncontinued investigation, without Steele’s interference. App.\n1313.\n\n        Steele appears to argue further that even if mitigating\nagainst security risks was the legitimate, non-punitive\npurpose behind Defendants’ actions, placement in\nadministrative segregation was “excessive” in light of this\npurpose. Stevenson, 495 F.3d at 67-68. Steele posits that,\ninstead of transferring him to administrative segregation,\nMCACC officials “could simply have monitored [him] more\nclosely, or further limited his movements and communication\nopportunities with other prisoners.” Suppl. Br. of Appellant\n3.     But the Due Process Clause does not mandate that\nMCACC officials use the least restrictive means available to\naccomplish their non-punitive objective. See Bell, 441 U.S. at\n542 n.25, 561; see also Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576,\n590 n.10, 591 n.11 (1984) (noting that “administrative\nofficials are not obliged to adopt the least restrictive means to\nmeet their legitimate objectives”). Indeed, the Supreme Court\nwas careful to explain in Bell that “[g]overnmental action\ndoes not have to be the only alternative or even the best\n\n       12\n         According to the complaint submitted about Steele’s\nconduct, Steele had specifically threatened to disclose one\ndetainee’s child sex offense charges. As Sergeant De Amicis\npointed out in his affidavit, “[c]hild sex offenders are among\nthe most hated members of the inmate population,” so\nconcerns for that detainee’s safety were “justifiabl[e].” App.\n1311.\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\falternative for it to be reasonable, to say nothing of\nconstitutional.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 542 n.25; see also Proctor\nv. LeClaire, 846 F.3d 597, 609 (2d Cir. 2017) (stating that the\nSupreme Court made clear in Hewitt that administrative\nsegregation “is appropriate when necessary to incapacitate an\ninmate who ‘represents a security threat’ or to ‘complet[e] . . .\nan investigation into misconduct charges’” (quoting Hewitt,\n459 U.S. at 476)).\n\n       Steele’s transfer to administrative segregation was not\nan excessive response by MCACC officials to legitimate\ninternal security concerns. As discussed, MCACC officials\nbelieved that Steele’s alleged bail bonds scheme posed a risk\nto other detainees because they had received information that\nSteele threatened to disclose a detainee’s sex offense charges\nto the general population as part of the scheme. In light of\nthese security concerns, it was a non-excessive response for\nMCACC officials to temporarily remove Steele from the\ngeneral population, where he would be in a position to make\nsuch threats to other detainees, while they investigated his\nconduct.13\n\n       In sum, Steele has not met his “heavy burden of\nshowing that [Defendants] have exaggerated their response to\nthe genuine security considerations that actuated” his move to\nmore restrictive conditions. Bell, 441 U.S. at 561-62.\nTherefore, we conclude that Steele’s transfer to\n\n       13\n           To the extent Steele argues separately that the\nrestriction of his phone privileges constituted prohibited\n“punishment” under Bell, we disagree, given that Steele\nadmitted to contact with Speedy over the phone.\n\n\n\n\n                               22\n\fadministrative segregation did not violate his substantive due\nprocess rights under Bell.14\n\n                 B. Procedural Due Process\n\n       In addition to his substantive due process claims,\nSteele asserts that Defendants denied his procedural due\nprocess rights when they transferred him to administrative\nsegregation. To maintain a procedural due process claim,\nSteele must show that: (1) Defendants deprived him of an\nindividual liberty interest that is encompassed within the\nFourteenth Amendment’s protection, and (2) the procedures\nDefendants made available to him did not provide due\nprocess of law. Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225,\n233-34 (3d Cir. 2006). The liberty rights protected by\nprocedural due process are broader than those protected by\nsubstantive due process; they “may arise from the\nConstitution itself, by reason of guarantees implicit in the\nword ‘liberty,’” or they “may arise from an expectation or\ninterest created by state laws or policies.” Wilkinson v.\n\n       14\n         Steele also argues that the District Court failed to\nconsider his pro se “letter brief” as an affidavit in opposition\nto Defendants’ summary judgment motion.                  Having\nconsidered the letter brief for purposes of this appeal, we\nconclude that, without more, Steele’s conclusory statement\nthat “defendants used the Administrative Segregation as a\npunishment because [Steele] did not want to agree with the\ndefendants to lie on Speedy bail bonds” is not sufficient\nevidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the\npurpose for Steele’s transfer and to overcome summary\njudgment as to Steele’s substantive due process claims.\nSuppl. Br. of Appellant 5.\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fAustin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005); see also Layton v. Beyer,\n953 F.2d 839, 845 (3d Cir. 1992). Interests in the latter\ncategory are often referred to as “state-created” liberty\ninterests.\n\n       Assuming without deciding that Steele’s claimed\nliberty interests are protected, we agree with the District\nCourt that Steele has not shown a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether Defendants provided due process of law.\nThe Supreme Court has explained that when an individual is\ntransferred to administrative segregation because he is “feared\nto be a threat to institutional security,” detention officials\nmust provide only\n\n             an     informal,       nonadversary\n             evidentiary review . . . for the\n             decision that an inmate represents\n             a security threat and the decision\n             to confine an inmate to\n             administrative           segregation\n             pending completion of an\n             investigation into misconduct\n             charges against him. An inmate\n             must merely receive some notice\n             of the charges against him and an\n             opportunity to present his views\n             to the prison official charged with\n             deciding whether to transfer him\n             to administrative segregation. . . .\n             So long as this occurs, and the\n             decisionmaker       reviews      the\n             charges      and      then-available\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\f              evidence against the prisoner, the\n              Due Process Clause is satisfied.\n\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 474, 476; see also Stevenson, 495 F.3d at\n70 (citing Hewitt). This informal review must take place\n“within a reasonable time following an inmate’s transfer.”\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 476 n.8.\n\n       Steele does not argue that he received insufficient\nprocess under Hewitt. Indeed, he appears to acknowledge\nthat he received notice of the allegations against him in an\ninterview with prison officials that took place prior to his\ntransfer. Steele himself testified that he was informed during\nthe February 25, 2009, meeting that MCACC officials had\nreceived a complaint about him “making money for the bail\nbondsmen” and “threatening inmates” to “try[] to get money\nout of them.” App. 1303. Steele was clear in his deposition\nthat he understood the nature of the allegations against him,\nexplaining that in “[t]he first meeting I’m getting the\ninformation. Now I know what’s going on. Now I know that\nthey are saying that, okay, we think that you’re getting paid\nfor every bail that you bring to them. . . . We think that you’re\ndoing this wrong. We think you’re doing this illegal.” App.\n1305. Steele admitted during the February 25th meeting that\nhe had arranged bail bonds with Speedy for other inmates, but\nclaimed he was arranging the bonds “out of the goodness of\n[his] heart.” App. 1305. There is no evidence in the record to\nsuggest that Steele sought and was denied the opportunity to\npresent any additional facts or evidence in support of his\nposition. And while MCACC officials may not have believed\nSteele’s explanation for his conduct, there is no evidence in\nthe record to suggest that they failed to consider his\nexplanation.\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\f       The focus of Steele’s procedural due process challenge\ncircles back to Defendants’ asserted reasons for transferring\nSteele to administrative segregation. He argues that he was\ntransferred for disciplinary reasons, and, therefore, due\nprocess protections required MCACC officials to provide him\nwith a written statement of the evidence and charges against\nhim, which he did not receive. See Stevenson, 495 F.3d at 70-\n71. For the reasons already noted, however, we agree with\nthe District Court that the summary judgment record in this\ncase shows that Steele’s transfer was for institutional security\nreasons rather than for discipline or punishment. Steele was\nadministratively separated from the general MCACC\npopulation pending further investigation into his conduct and\nSpeedy’s activities within the MCACC. Therefore, he was\ndue the level of process outlined in Hewitt.15\n\n       15\n          Steele also argues, in a single paragraph, that the\nabsence of a specific notice informing him that his telephone\nprivileges would be restricted in administrative segregation\nviolates the Due Process Clause. We cannot agree that\nMCACC officials were required to explain in their interview\nwith Steele all of the attendant restrictions of his\nadministrative segregation. The key inquiry was whether he\nreceived notice of the charges against him and had an\nopportunity to respond. Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 476; see also\nArtway v. Att’y Gen. of State of N.J., 81 F.3d 1235, 1252 (3d\nCir. 1996) (“Due Process requires ‘notice reasonably\ncalculated . . . to apprise interested parties of pendency of the\naction and afford them an opportunity to present their\nobjections.’” (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &\nTrust, 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950))); Taylor v. Rodriguez, 238\nF.3d 188, 192-93 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that “the effect of\n\n\n\n\n                               26\n\f       Steele also contends throughout his briefing that\nDefendants violated the Due Process Clause by failing to\nfollow the procedures outlined in the Manual. Even if we\nwere to find that the parties’ actions implicated certain\nprocedures set forth in the Manual, there is no standalone\nprotected liberty interest in those procedures. See Rodriguez\nv. McLoughlin, 214 F.3d 328, 339 (2d Cir. 2000) (explaining\nthat a state statute “that merely establishes procedural\nrequirements does not thereby create a liberty interest,\nbecause an expectation of receiving process is not, without\nmore, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). The Supreme Court has\nexplained that\n\n             [p]rocess is not an end in itself.\n             Its constitutional purpose is to\n             protect a substantive interest to\n             which the individual has a\n             legitimate claim of entitlement. . .\n             . The State may choose to require\n             procedures for reasons other than\n             protection against deprivation of\n             substantive rights, of course, but\n             in making that choice the State\n             does not create an independent\n\n\nthe notice should be to compel the charging officer to be\n[sufficiently] specific as to the misconduct with which the\ninmate is charged to inform the inmate of what he is accused\nof doing so that he can prepare a defense to those charges and\nnot be made to explain away vague charges.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). As discussed, there is no dispute\nthat Steele received such notice here.\n\n\n\n\n                             27\n\f              substantive                   right.\n\nOlim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250-51 (1983). In other\nwords, a valid due process claim will not automatically\nfollow from Defendants’ failure to abide by the Manual’s\nprocedural requirements.\n\n        Further, where a plaintiff establishes a state-created\nliberty interest, a court must determine the level of process\ndue by drawing from federal constitutional law, not from state\nlaws, regulations, or policies. Layton, 953 F.2d at 851-52\n(holding that while consideration of state regulations “may be\nrelevant in determining” what process is due, “they clearly do\nnot, in and of themselves, define or control the requirements\nof the Constitution”); see also Cleveland Bd. of Edu. v.\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985) (explaining that “once\nit is determined that the Due Process Clause applies, . . . [t]he\nanswer to th[e] question [of what process is due] is not to be\nfound in the [state] statute”). So here, the MCACC Manual\ndoes not dictate what level of process will pass constitutional\nmuster. Accordingly, this argument fails.\n\n                     V. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment to all Defendants on Steele’s substantive\nand procedural due process claims will be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f",

Officials believed that Steele was threatening other\ndetainees in order to coerce them into using Speedy and that\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fSteele was receiving some form of compensation from\nSpeedy for his efforts. After interviewing Steele and advising\nhim of the allegations against him, officials placed him in\nadministrative segregation while they continued to investigate\nhis conduct. During his time in segregation, Steele’s\ntelephone privileges were restricted to legal calls only.\n\n        Steele claims in this Section 1983 suit that the\nDefendant/Appellee MCACC officials violated his due\nprocess rights when they transferred him to administrative\nsegregation in the facility and restricted his phone privileges,\nwhich interfered with his ability to attempt to find a co-signer\nfor his own bail. The District Court granted summary\njudgment for all Defendants. For the reasons that follow, we\nwill affirm.\n\n              I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND1\n\n       On December 22, 2008, Steele was arrested for\nviolating a narcotics restraining order. He was then placed\ninto pretrial detention at MCACC. The next day, Steele’s bail\nwas set at $50,000, which he was unable to pay.\n\n       On February 23, 2009, while Steele remained in\ndetention at MCACC, Robert Gluck, a private attorney,\ncontacted MCACC Deputy Warden Masone about safety\nconcerns Gluck had for his client, another MCACC detainee.\nAccording to Gluck, Steele approached Gluck’s client and\nthreatened to disclose his client’s sex offense charges to\nMCACC’s general population if Gluck’s client did not use a\n\n       1\n         The parties have not disputed the facts outlined\nherein, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\fspecific bail bonds service, Speedy Bail Bonds. Gluck\nreported that Steele handed his client a document that listed\nhis client’s charges and bail amount. Gluck also faxed to\nMasone a copy of the document.\n\n       After obtaining this information from Gluck, Masone\nand Sergeant Paul De Amicis began an investigation of Steele\nand Speedy’s activities within MCACC. They interviewed\nGluck’s client, who confirmed that Steele threatened him and\nprovided him with a specific phone number to use to arrange\nhis bail. Masone and De Amicis confirmed that the phone\nnumber belonged to a Speedy office.\n\n        De Amicis continued the investigation by reviewing\nrecorded phone calls from the unit in which Steele was\nhoused. He found numerous calls between Steele and\nSpeedy, during which Steele referenced detainees’ names,\nidentification numbers, and the specific amounts of their\nbails. According to De Amicis, Steele bragged in some of\nthose phone conversations about “his ability to get other\ninmates to post bail using Speedy” and Steele “referred to\ncredit he expected to receive for bails he recruited for\nSpeedy.” App. 1312. Based on the results of the preliminary\ninvestigation, MCACC officials believed that Steele “was\nacting as an illegal agent for Speedy” and that he was\nreceiving some type of compensation from Speedy in\nexchange for his efforts to arrange detainees’ bails. App.\n1312.\n\n      MCACC officials met with Steele on February 25,\n2009, just two days after Gluck’s call, to discuss the\n\n\n\n\n                             5\n\fallegations.2 During the meeting, MCACC officials apprised\nSteele of a complaint they received that he had been “making\nmoney for the bail bondsmen,” “threatening inmates,” and\n“trying to get money out of [them].” App. 1303. Officials\nasked Steele to explain his actions with Speedy and permitted\nhim to respond to their questions. Steele admitted to helping\nother detainees arrange bails, but denied that he was receiving\nany compensation from Speedy. Steele stated that he was\narranging detainees’ bails with Speedy “out of the goodness\nof [his] heart.” App. 1305. As officials were meeting with\nSteele on February 25th, MCACC corrections officers\nsearched Steele’s cell and found materials that corroborated\nthe allegations against him. These materials included lists of\ndetainees’ names, bail amounts, and phone numbers of\ndetainees’ friends and relatives.\n\n      That same day, Steele was transferred to\nadministrative segregation.3 De Amicis averred that Steele\nwas placed in administrative segregation in order “to prevent\n\n       2\n         Sergeant De Amicis stated that the officials who\nattended the meeting were Warden Cicchi, Deputy Warden\nMasone, and De Amicis. According to Steele’s complaint,\nMasone, Defendant Captain Barth, and probably De Amicis\nattended the meeting. During his deposition, Steele stated\nthat Barth and Masone were the MCACC officials who\nattended the February 25th meeting.\n       3\n         On February 26, 2009, MCACC provided Steele with\na letter confirming his transfer to administrative segregation,\nwhich noted that the Classification Committee would review\nSteele’s status on a monthly basis.\n\n\n\n\n                              6\n\fhim from posing additional security risks in the [MCACC]\nand to allow further investigation into Speedy’s activities\nwithout [Steele’s] interference.” App. 1313. Later in the day\non February 25th, Masone and De Amicis met with\nemployees of Speedy, who confirmed that Steele was an\n“associate” who was recruiting other detainees to use Speedy\nfor their bail bonds. App. 1313. After further investigation,\nMCACC officials contacted the county prosecutor’s office\nand the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\n       The MCACC “Inmate Guidelines” manual (“the\nManual”), which served as a guide for inmate conduct and jail\nprocedures, contained a number of provisions addressing\ntelephone access at the facility. It provided that individuals\nhoused in the general population had open access to collect\ncall telephones for personal calls and were allowed an\nunlimited number of legal calls. It also provided that\nindividuals placed in “disciplinary lockup” were not\npermitted telephone access, with the exception of legal\ntelephone calls. App. 1345. The Manual did not address\ntelephone access for detainees housed in administrative\nsegregation.4     While he remained in administrative\nsegregation, Steele was permitted only to make legal calls,\nthrough the MCACC social work office.\n\n      4\n         The New Jersey Department of Corrections’ 1999\n“Handbook for Discipline for Inmates” was appended to the\nManual. The Handbook addressed telephone access for\ninmates placed in Administrative Segregation. However, the\nHandbook stated that it applied only to state-sentenced\ninmates. Steele has not argued on appeal that the Handbook\napplied to him; his arguments center on the MCACC’s own\ninternal Manual.\n\n\n\n\n                              7\n\f       On March 5, 2009, Steele’s bail was reduced from\n$50,000 to $2,500. Thereafter, Steele made three attempts to\ncontact his attorney to help him obtain a co-signer for his bail.\nSteele reached the attorney’s secretary twice, and made\ncontact with his lawyer on his third attempt. On March 20,\n2009, Steele’s bail was posted and he was released.\n\n              II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Steele originally filed this action pro se in July 2009 in\nthe United States District Court for the District of New\nJersey. The operative Amended Complaint was filed pro se\nin May 2012. In his Amended Complaint, Steele asserted\nseveral claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983: violations of his First,\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n       In December 2013, after five rounds of summary\njudgment motions, the District Court granted summary\njudgment to Defendants as to Steele’s First and Eighth\nAmendment claims. The Court denied summary judgment as\nto Steele’s claims under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, but permitted Defendants to move\nfor summary judgment again on those claims in January\n2014. In May 2014, the District Court granted summary\njudgment to all Defendants on Steele’s Fourteenth\nAmendment claims, holding that they did not violate Steele’s\nrights under the substantive and procedural components of the\nDue Process Clause. Steele filed this timely appeal.5\n\n\n       5\n         This Court granted Steele appointment of counsel for\nhis appeal. He does not challenge the District Court’s\ndisposition of his First and Eighth Amendment claims.\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\f   III. JURISDICTION & STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction over this Section\n1983 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

Steele claims that Defendants violated both\ncomponents, which we address in turn below.\n\n                A. Substantive Due Process\n\n      “The substantive component of the Due Process\nClause limits what government may do regardless of the\n\n\n\n\n                              9\n\ffairness of procedures that it employs,” Boyanowski v.\nCapital Area Intermediate Unit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769050\"><a href=\"/opinion/769050/donald-boyanowski-individually-donald-boyanowski-tdba-boyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (3d Cir.\n2000), in order to “guarantee protect[ion] against government\npower arbitrarily and oppressively exercised,” Lewis, 523\nU.S. at 846 (citing Daniels v.

To maintain a substantive due process claim, Steele\nmust have been deprived of a particular interest that “is\nprotected by the substantive due process clause.” Chainey v.\nStreet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444397\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444397/chainey-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n       Steele claims that Defendants’ actions infringed on\nfour separate liberty interests.       First, he asserts that\nDefendants interfered with his “constitutionally-protected\nliberty interest” in “posting bail once his bail was set.”6 Br.\nof Appellant 16 (capitalization omitted). Second, Steele\nargues that by placing him in administrative segregation,\nDefendants interfered with his constitutional liberty interest in\navoiding punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt. Third,\nSteele contends that Defendants interfered with his “state-\ncreated liberty interest[]” in accessing the telephones at\nMCACC, an interest that Steele argues was created by the\nMCACC Manual. Br. of Appellant 24. Fourth, Steele argues\nthat his administrative segregation violated his “state-created\nliberty interest in remaining part of the general prison\npopulation.” Suppl. Br. of Appellant 1-2.\n\n      As an initial matter, Steele cannot proceed on his third\nand fourth claimed liberty interests, because substantive due\n\n       6\n         To be clear, Steele claims a liberty interest in\nexercising his bail option using funds already available to\nhim. His claim does not touch on issues relating to the\namount of his bail or his ability to pay.\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fprocess claims do not arise out of state-created liberty\ninterests. In contrast to procedural due process rights, which\nmay be derived from state law, “[s]ubstantive due process\nrights are founded not upon state law but upon deeply rooted\nnotions of fundamental personal interests derived from the\nConstitution.” Nunez v. Pachman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456404/nunez-v-pachman/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 (3d Cir.\n2009) (quoting Nilson v.

Therefore, as we examine\nSteele’s substantive due process claims here, we consider\nonly Steele’s two claimed constitutionally protected liberty\ninterests, which are themselves interrelated. These are: (1)\nexercising his bail option once his bail was set, and (2)\nremaining free from punishment before an adjudication of\nguilt.7\n\n                   1. Exercising bail option\n\n      There is no dispute between the parties that Steele had\na constitutionally protected liberty interest in exercising his\n\n       7\n          The District Court addressed Steele’s allegations\nregarding bail access only insofar as they related to the\nquestion of whether his transfer to administrative\nsegregation amounted to unconstitutional punishment.\nBecause we understand Steele to advance these as two\nfactually intertwined but legally independent substantive due\nprocess claims, we will address each separately.\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\fbail option, once bail had been set, sufficient to trigger\nsubstantive due process protection. We agree. Such a right\nemanates from the liberties “at the heart” of the Due Process\nClause: the freedom “from government custody, detention, or\nother forms of physical restraint” prior to any determination\nof guilt. Zadvydas v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269289\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269289/zadvydas-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (2001); see\nalso Foucha v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112731\"><a href=\"/opinion/112731/foucha-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1992) (“Freedom\nfrom bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty\nprotected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary\ngovernmental action.”). The Supreme Court has explained\nthat an arrestee’s right to freedom from pretrial detention is\nsubordinated to other interests only in specific circumstances\n– particularly where there has been an adjudication that\ndetention is necessary because an “arrestee presents an\nidentified and articulable threat to an individual or the\ncommunity,” United States v. Salerno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750-51\n(1987), or to “ensure [an arrestee’s] presence at trial,” Bell v.\nWolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (1979). But those circumstances\ndo not exist in a case like this one, where there has already\nbeen a judicial determination that an arrestee is eligible for\nrelease on bail and bail has been set for that arrestee.\n\n        Other Circuits acknowledge that substantive due\nprocess protection of this liberty interest attaches once\narrestees are deemed eligible for release on bail. For\ninstance, in Dodds v. Richardson, the Tenth Circuit explained\nthat “an arrestee obtains a liberty interest in being freed of\ndetention once his bail is set because the setting of bail\naccepts the security of the bond for the arrestee’s appearance\nat trial.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158503\"><a href=\"/opinion/158503/dodds-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1192 (10th Cir. 2010). Likewise,\nthe Eleventh Circuit held in Campbell v. Johnson that “[t]he\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause includes the right\nto be free from continued detention after it was or should\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fhave been known that the detainee was entitled to release.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78467\"><a href=\"/opinion/78467/campbell-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 840 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Accordingly, we conclude that Steele had a\nprotected liberty interest in exercising his bail option once his\nbail was set.\n\n        Having established that his asserted liberty interest is\nprotected by substantive due process, Steele must also show\nthat “the government’s deprivation of that protected interest\nshocks the conscience.” Chainey, 523 F.3d at 219. The\nSupreme Court has instructed that we must apply the “shocks\nthe conscience” standard where, as here, the challenged\ngovernment action is executive in nature rather than\nlegislative.8 See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 845-47. “[T]he exact\ndegree of wrongfulness necessary to reach the ‘conscience-\nshocking’ level” will “depend[] upon the circumstances of a\nparticular case,” and may range from “deliberate\nindifference” to “actual intent to cause harm.” Vargas v.

We cannot say that Defendants’ actions here\namount to even deliberate indifference.\n\n       MCACC officials permitted Steele, during his time in\nadministrative segregation, to make calls to his attorney to\narrange for bail. Indeed, Steele made three such phone calls\nto his attorney’s office, through the MCACC social work\n\n       8\n         Where the government infringes on a plaintiff’s right\nthrough legislative activity, by contrast, the Supreme Court\nhas explained that we must determine whether the legislation\nat issue is “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\ninterest.” Washington v.

Steele offered no evidence that MCACC\nstaff prevented or inhibited him from attempting to contact\nhis attorney via phone. Steele also offered nothing to suggest\nthat his attorney was ill-equipped to assist Steele with\narranging bail. In addition, Steele’s access to mail was not\nrestricted during his time in segregation. In short, though\nMCACC officials curtailed Steele’s unlimited, non-legal\nphone privileges during his administrative segregation,\nofficials preserved two key channels of communication\nthrough which Steele could attempt to secure his bail while in\nsegregation.\n\n        Steele’s circumstances are distinguishable from the\narrestees’ circumstances in Dodds and Campbell. In Dodds,\nafter a judge set the plaintiff-arrestee’s bond, two individuals\nasked employees at the jail where the plaintiff was housed\nabout posting bond on the plaintiff’s behalf. Dodds, 614 F.3d\nat 1189-90. Those individuals were told in response by jail\nemployees that bond would not be accepted before the\nplaintiff was arraigned by a judge, consistent with local\npolicies. Id. The Tenth Circuit concluded that evidence\nshowing the defendants’ policies “prevented felony arrestees\nwhose bail had been set from posting bail after hours and\nbefore arraignment” was sufficient to overcome summary\njudgment on plaintiff’s due process claim. Id. at 1206\n(emphasis added).\n\n        In Campbell, jail administrators refused to accept\ncourt-approved real estate documents as security for the\nplaintiff-arrestee’s bail for months after his bail was set.\nCampbell, 586 F.3d at 838-39.

Freedom from punishment\n\n        Steele also claims that his placement in administrative\nsegregation violated his substantive due process right to be\nfree from punishment. Under the analytical framework\nestablished in Bell, detention officials’ restrictions on pretrial\ndetainees will constitute punishment prohibited by the Due\nProcess Clause when: (1) “there is a showing of express\nintent to punish on the part of [those] [] officials”; (2) “the\nrestriction or condition is not rationally related to a legitimate\nnon-punitive government purpose,” i.e., “if it is arbitrary or\npurposeless”; or (3) “the restriction is excessive in light of\nthat purpose.” Stevenson, 495 F.3d at 67-68 (quoting Rapier,\n172 F.3d at 1005). Of these three possible means to establish\npunishment, Steele asserts only the second and third; he has\nnot argued in his briefing that such an intent to punish was\nexpress in nature.\n\n\nv.

He challenges the\ncurtailment of a separate and independent liberty interest that\narose from his pretrial detention: his right to be freed from\nthat detention, by exercising his bail option, once his bail was\nset. This claim fits awkwardly into the Bell framework, and\nmore comfortably into the general “shocks the conscience”\nsubstantive due process framework applicable to executive\nactions. Nevertheless, for many of the same reasons provided\nin Section IV(A)(2), infra, Steele’s bail claim would fare no\nbetter under Bell.\n\n\n\n\n                               17\n\f       The term “punishment” in this context warrants further\nexplanation. “Punishment,” as used in Bell, refers to the\npunishment of a pretrial detainee for his alleged criminal\nconduct, committed prior to his detention, for which he has\nnot yet been convicted. Bell, 441 U.S. at 535-36. The\nSupreme Court explained that this type of “punishment” is\nprohibited by the Due Process Clause because the detainee\n“ha[d] not been adjudged guilty of any crime” and “had only\na ‘judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to\n[the] extended restraint of [his] liberty following arrest.’” Id.\nat 536-37 (quoting Gerstein v.

Bell did not concern the type of “punishment” or\ndiscipline alleged in this case: punishment of a detainee for\nhis in-facility conduct that might violate the facility’s rules\nand policies. Despite the apparent distinctions between Bell\nand cases where a detainee claims that he was “punished” for\nhis in-facility conduct, we agree with the First Circuit’s\ndetermination in Collazo-Leon v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons that\nthe “theoretical constitutional premises of Bell’s analysis\nprovides some rational guidance” for evaluating claims\ninvolving in-facility conduct that could\nwarrant disciplinary action.11 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196009\"><a href=\"/opinion/196009/collazo-leon-v-us-bureau-of-prisons/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317-18 (1st Cir.\n1995).\n\n\n11\n     The First Circuit explained in Collazo-Leon,\n\n                [o]n the authority of Bell, it may\n                be divined that even if a\n                restriction or condition may be\n                viewed as having a punitive effect\n                on the pretrial detainee, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                18\n\f        With that understanding, we turn to the question of\nwhether Defendants had a “legitimate governmental\nobjective” in transferring Steele to administrative segregation\nin this case. Steele argues that his segregation did not serve\nany rational purpose other than punishment. Viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to Steele, as we must, we\ncannot agree that Steele has presented evidence sufficient to\ncreate a genuine dispute of material fact on this issue. The\nrecord shows that Steele was placed into administrative\nsegregation for internal security reasons.\n\n        The Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that\nmaintaining internal security and order in jails and prisons are\n“legitimate governmental objectives” and that courts must\ngive prison officials considerable discretion to manage\n\n\n              nonetheless constitutional if it\n              also furthers\n              some legitimate governmental\n              objective such as addressing a\n              specific institutional violation and\n              is not excessive in light of the\n              seriousness of the violation. . . . If\n              there is a reasonable relation\n              between the sanctions and\n              legitimate institutional policies, an\n              intent to punish the detainee for\n              prior unproven criminal conduct\n              cannot be inferred.\n\n51 F.3d at 318.\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\finternal security in their institutions.

Courts must afford such deference\nbecause “assessing the seriousness of a threat” requires\nofficials to do more than simply take stock of the “specific\nfacts surrounding a particular incident; instead, they must\nconsider the character of the inmates confined in the\ninstitution, recent and longstanding relations between\nprisoners and guards, prisoners inter se, and the like.”\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 474.\n\n       Of course, officials’ discretion is not unbridled. They\ncannot insulate themselves from liability under the Due\nProcess Clause by mechanically citing to broad internal\nsecurity interests, regardless of how insignificant or unlikely\nto occur a particular threat might be. But the record before us\nsuggests that the threat posed to internal security by Steele’s\nconduct was legitimate and ongoing. MCACC officials had\nevidence that Steele was conducting an illegal bail bonds\nscheme with Speedy over the phone. They also believed that\nSteele’s actions endangered other detainees in the facility\nbecause Steele was threatening to disclose detainees’ charges\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\fto the general MCACC population if those detainees did not\nuse Speedy’s service.12         So Steele “was placed in\nadministrative segregation . . . to prevent him from posing\nany additional security risks in the facility,” and to allow for\ncontinued investigation, without Steele’s interference. App.\n1313.\n\n        Steele appears to argue further that even if mitigating\nagainst security risks was the legitimate, non-punitive\npurpose behind Defendants’ actions, placement in\nadministrative segregation was “excessive” in light of this\npurpose. Stevenson, 495 F.3d at 67-68. Steele posits that,\ninstead of transferring him to administrative segregation,\nMCACC officials “could simply have monitored [him] more\nclosely, or further limited his movements and communication\nopportunities with other prisoners.” Suppl. Br. of Appellant\n3.     But the Due Process Clause does not mandate that\nMCACC officials use the least restrictive means available to\naccomplish their non-punitive objective. See Bell, 441 U.S. at\n542 n.25, 561; see also Block v.

As discussed, MCACC officials\nbelieved that Steele’s alleged bail bonds scheme posed a risk\nto other detainees because they had received information that\nSteele threatened to disclose a detainee’s sex offense charges\nto the general population as part of the scheme. In light of\nthese security concerns, it was a non-excessive response for\nMCACC officials to temporarily remove Steele from the\ngeneral population, where he would be in a position to make\nsuch threats to other detainees, while they investigated his\nconduct.13\n\n       In sum, Steele has not met his “heavy burden of\nshowing that [Defendants] have exaggerated their response to\nthe genuine security considerations that actuated” his move to\nmore restrictive conditions. Bell, 441 U.S. at 561-62.\nTherefore, we conclude that Steele’s transfer to\n\n       13\n           To the extent Steele argues separately that the\nrestriction of his phone privileges constituted prohibited\n“punishment” under Bell, we disagree, given that Steele\nadmitted to contact with Speedy over the phone.\n\n\n\n\n                               22\n\fadministrative segregation did not violate his substantive due\nprocess rights under Bell.14\n\n                 B. Procedural Due Process\n\n       In addition to his substantive due process claims,\nSteele asserts that Defendants denied his procedural due\nprocess rights when they transferred him to administrative\nsegregation. To maintain a procedural due process claim,\nSteele must show that: (1) Defendants deprived him of an\nindividual liberty interest that is encompassed within the\nFourteenth Amendment’s protection, and (2) the procedures\nDefendants made available to him did not provide due\nprocess of law.

The liberty rights protected by\nprocedural due process are broader than those protected by\nsubstantive due process; they “may arise from the\nConstitution itself, by reason of guarantees implicit in the\nword ‘liberty,’” or they “may arise from an expectation or\ninterest created by state laws or policies.” Wilkinson v.\n\n       14\n         Steele also argues that the District Court failed to\nconsider his pro se “letter brief” as an affidavit in opposition\nto Defendants’ summary judgment motion.                  Having\nconsidered the letter brief for purposes of this appeal, we\nconclude that, without more, Steele’s conclusory statement\nthat “defendants used the Administrative Segregation as a\npunishment because [Steele] did not want to agree with the\ndefendants to lie on Speedy bail bonds” is not sufficient\nevidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the\npurpose for Steele’s transfer and to overcome summary\njudgment as to Steele’s substantive due process claims.\nSuppl.

Interests in the latter\ncategory are often referred to as “state-created” liberty\ninterests.\n\n       Assuming without deciding that Steele’s claimed\nliberty interests are protected, we agree with the District\nCourt that Steele has not shown a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether Defendants provided due process of law.\nThe Supreme Court has explained that when an individual is\ntransferred to administrative segregation because he is “feared\nto be a threat to institutional security,” detention officials\nmust provide only\n\n             an     informal,       nonadversary\n             evidentiary review . . . for the\n             decision that an inmate represents\n             a security threat and the decision\n             to confine an inmate to\n             administrative           segregation\n             pending completion of an\n             investigation into misconduct\n             charges against him. An inmate\n             must merely receive some notice\n             of the charges against him and an\n             opportunity to present his views\n             to the prison official charged with\n             deciding whether to transfer him\n             to administrative segregation. . . .\n             So long as this occurs, and the\n             decisionmaker       reviews      the\n             charges      and      then-available\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\f              evidence against the prisoner, the\n              Due Process Clause is satisfied.\n\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 474, 476; see also Stevenson, 495 F.3d at\n70 (citing Hewitt). This informal review must take place\n“within a reasonable time following an inmate’s transfer.”\nHewitt, 459 U.S. at 476 n.8.\n\n       Steele does not argue that he received insufficient\nprocess under Hewitt. Indeed, he appears to acknowledge\nthat he received notice of the allegations against him in an\ninterview with prison officials that took place prior to his\ntransfer. Steele himself testified that he was informed during\nthe February 25, 2009, meeting that MCACC officials had\nreceived a complaint about him “making money for the bail\nbondsmen” and “threatening inmates” to “try[] to get money\nout of them.” App. 1303. Steele was clear in his deposition\nthat he understood the nature of the allegations against him,\nexplaining that in “[t]he first meeting I’m getting the\ninformation. Now I know what’s going on. Now I know that\nthey are saying that, okay, we think that you’re getting paid\nfor every bail that you bring to them. . . . We think that you’re\ndoing this wrong. We think you’re doing this illegal.” App.\n1305. Steele admitted during the February 25th meeting that\nhe had arranged bail bonds with Speedy for other inmates, but\nclaimed he was arranging the bonds “out of the goodness of\n[his] heart.” App. 1305. There is no evidence in the record to\nsuggest that Steele sought and was denied the opportunity to\npresent any additional facts or evidence in support of his\nposition. And while MCACC officials may not have believed\nSteele’s explanation for his conduct, there is no evidence in\nthe record to suggest that they failed to consider his\nexplanation.\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\f       The focus of Steele’s procedural due process challenge\ncircles back to Defendants’ asserted reasons for transferring\nSteele to administrative segregation. He argues that he was\ntransferred for disciplinary reasons, and, therefore, due\nprocess protections required MCACC officials to provide him\nwith a written statement of the evidence and charges against\nhim, which he did not receive. See Stevenson, 495 F.3d at 70-\n71. For the reasons already noted, however, we agree with\nthe District Court that the summary judgment record in this\ncase shows that Steele’s transfer was for institutional security\nreasons rather than for discipline or punishment. Steele was\nadministratively separated from the general MCACC\npopulation pending further investigation into his conduct and\nSpeedy’s activities within the MCACC. Therefore, he was\ndue the level of process outlined in Hewitt.15\n\n       15\n          Steele also argues, in a single paragraph, that the\nabsence of a specific notice informing him that his telephone\nprivileges would be restricted in administrative segregation\nviolates the Due Process Clause. We cannot agree that\nMCACC officials were required to explain in their interview\nwith Steele all of the attendant restrictions of his\nadministrative segregation. The key inquiry was whether he\nreceived notice of the charges against him and had an\nopportunity to respond. Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 476; see also\nArtway v.

The Supreme Court has\nexplained that\n\n             [p]rocess is not an end in itself.\n             Its constitutional purpose is to\n             protect a substantive interest to\n             which the individual has a\n             legitimate claim of entitlement. . .\n             .

In other\nwords, a valid due process claim will not automatically\nfollow from Defendants’ failure to abide by the Manual’s\nprocedural requirements.\n\n        Further, where a plaintiff establishes a state-created\nliberty interest, a court must determine the level of process\ndue by drawing from federal constitutional law, not from state\nlaws, regulations, or policies. Layton, 953 F.2d at 851-52\n(holding that while consideration of state regulations “may be\nrelevant in determining” what process is due, “they clearly do\nnot, in and of themselves, define or control the requirements\nof the Constitution”); see also Cleveland Bd. of Edu. v.\nLoudermill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541 (1985) (explaining that “once\nit is determined that the Due Process Clause applies, . . .

So here, the MCACC Manual\ndoes not dictate what level of process will pass constitutional\nmuster. Accordingly, this argument fails.\n\n                     V.
