Their trials were severed from those of alleged co-conspirators with whom\nthey were indicted in connection with these events. Centeno, Leon, and Palofox each\nreceived life sentences for their role in the conspiracy based on a jury’s findings that the\nrobberies were gang-related. Gang allegations were found not true as to Rivas, who was\nsentenced to a total of 22 years in prison. We have consolidated the parties’ individual\nappeals for purposes of briefing and decision.\n       Appellants allege error with respect to the admissibility of various evidence used\nat trial and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting certain convictions. The trial\ncourt’s sentencing decisions are challenged on multiple grounds. There are also\nassertions of constitutionally deficient performance by trial counsel, as well as a claim\nthat racial discrimination tainted the jury selection process. We affirm in part and reverse\nin part.\n       In the published portion of the opinion, we apply the California Supreme Court’s\nrecent decision in People v. Elizalde (2015) 61 Cal.4th 523 (Elizalde) to resolve\nchallenges to evidence of gang affiliation admissions made by Centeno and appellants’\nco-conspirators when they were booked into jail. We conclude any prohibited use of\nCenteno’s admission was harmless error, and that the self-incriminating statements were\nnot testimonial for purposes of the constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses. Our\n\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fpublished discussion further holds that trial courts have discretion under Penal Code1\nsection 669 to impose concurrent sentences for gang-related offenses punishable under\nthe alternate penalty provisions of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4).\n                               STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n       The underlying events occurred in February and March of 2010 when a group of\npeople from Arizona, working in conjunction with an individual who lived in California,\ncarried out a series of home invasion robberies in the cities of Atwater, Clovis, Kerman,\nand Selma. The crimes were carefully coordinated, sometimes involving upwards of 10\nperpetrators, and followed the same general pattern. The men would split up into two\ngroups of lookouts and intruders, with the former stationing themselves in parked cars at\nstrategically selected locations and maintaining communication with the intruders over\ncell phones and “walkie-talkies.” The intruders, meanwhile, would enter homes and\nforce the occupants inside to surrender cash, gold, and other items of value. Armed with\nguns, they threatened to kill their victims and used violence to extract information about\nthe location of money and valuables. The victims were sometimes tied up with electrical\ncords and other makeshift restraints. In three of the five incidents, an automobile was\nstolen during the course of the robbery.\n       A joint investigatory effort by law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona\nled to the arrest and prosecution of nine suspects. On March 22, 2011, a Fresno County\ngrand jury returned an 18-count indictment against appellants and their accomplices,\nGilbert Beltran, Christopher Escobedo, Estevan Landeros, Christian Rodriguez, and Eric\nRodriguez. Count 1 of the indictment charged all parties with criminal conspiracy in\nviolation of section 182, subdivision (a)(1). Leon and Rivas, along with co-conspirators\nEstevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez, were each charged in Counts 2 through 18 for\ntheir respective roles in the five robberies. All parties, including Centeno and Palofox,\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                               4.\n\fwere charged in Counts 11 through 18 for their participation in the last two of those\nrobberies. Centeno, who was 17 years old at the time of the offenses, was charged as an\nadult pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (d)(1).\n       Appellants were tried before a Fresno County jury in May and June 2012. A\nbifurcated trial was conducted on gang allegations that were made pursuant to section\n186.22, subdivision (b). Trial evidence relevant to the claims on appeal is described\nwithin the body of our Discussion.\n       The first two robberies occurred on February 24, 2010 in Clovis and Atwater. For\nhis part in the Clovis robbery, Rivas was convicted of robbery in concert (§§ 211, 213,\nsubd. (a)(1)(A); Count 2), false imprisonment by violence (§§ 236, 237; Count 3), and\nusing threats or violence to prevent or dissuade a victim from reporting a crime (§ 136.1,\nsubd. (c)(1); Count 4). In relation to the Atwater robbery, Rivas was convicted of\nrobbery in concert (Count 5), assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury (§ 245,\nsubd. (a)(1); Count 6), false imprisonment by violence (Count 7), and vehicle theft (Veh.\nCode, § 10851, subd. (a); Count 8). He was also found guilty of conspiracy under\nCount 1. Leon was convicted of conspiracy as well, but was acquitted on Counts 2\nthrough 8.\n       The third robbery took place in Kerman on March 15, 2010. For this incident,\nLeon and Rivas were convicted of robbery in concert (Count 9) and false imprisonment\nby violence (Count 10). As to Leon, the robbery was found to be gang-related within the\nmeaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b).\n       The fourth and fifth robberies occurred on March 16, 2010 in Atwater and Selma.\nFor the (second) Atwater robbery, all appellants were convicted of robbery in concert\n(Count 11), false imprisonment by violence (Count 12), assault with a semiautomatic\nfirearm (§ 245, subd. (b); Count 13), making criminal threats (§ 422; Count 14), and\nvehicle theft (Count 15). In regards to the Selma robbery, appellants were convicted of\nrobbery in concert (Count 16), false imprisonment (Count 17), and vehicle theft\n\n                                              5.\n\f(Count 18). As to Centeno, Leon, and Palofox, the robberies were found to be gang-\nrelated. Enhancement allegations for personal use of a firearm within the meaning of\nsection 12022.5, subdivision (a) were found true as to Leon on Counts 11 and 12.\n       Leon was sentenced to an aggregate term of 48 years to life in prison. For robbery\nin concert under Counts 9, 11, and 16, he received consecutive terms of 15 years to life\nbased on the alternate penalty set forth in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B). A\nconsecutive three-year term was imposed for the gun enhancement attached to Count 11.\nConcurrent terms were imposed for Counts 14, 15, and 18, with all other sentences\nstayed.\n       Centeno and Palofox received sentences of 30 years to life in prison based on the\ngang-related robbery convictions on Counts 11 and 16. Concurrent terms were imposed\nfor Counts 13, 14, 15, and 18. All other sentences were stayed.\n       Rivas was sentenced to a total of 22 years in prison as follows: The upper term of\n9 years under Count 2 for robbery in concert, plus consecutive two-year terms (one-third\nof the middle term) for each robbery in concert conviction under Counts 5, 9, 11 and 16,\nplus a consecutive three-year term for Count 4, and a consecutive two-year term for\nCount 13. Concurrent terms were imposed as to Counts 8, 14, 15, and 18. Stayed\nsentences were imposed for all remaining counts.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n   I. Palofox’s Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim\n       Palofox contends that one or more attorneys who represented him below failed to\nconvey material information about a plea offer. If true, such failures might entitle him to\nrelief on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record, however, does not\nsubstantiate his allegations of deficient performance and prejudice. We therefore reject\nhis claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\fBackground\n        Palofox was represented at the earliest hearings in the case by Nancy Wong, who\nthen worked as a deputy public defender in Fresno County. Ms. Wong made at least four\ncourt appearances on behalf of Palofox during the months of June, September, and\nDecember 2010. While stating her appearance on September 14, 2010, Ms. Wong noted\nthat she was “standing in for Roberto Dulce,” referring to another deputy public defender\nin her office. Mr. Dulce had at that point made two prior court appearances with Palofox\nduring the month of August, and later represented him at a hearing held on October 12,\n2010.\n        On December 3, 2010, Ms. Wong attended a court hearing with Palofox where the\ntopic of plea bargains arose during a discussion about scheduling. The reporter’s\ntranscript reflects that an unidentified defense attorney said, “My only concern is that we\njust got handed written offers in court today, and it says that the offer will remain open\nuntil the next pre-prelim set after today’s date. Does that mean and only then, or then\nthey will be withdrawn or will it be – ” The prosecutor interrupted with the following\nremarks: “Your Honor, I did hand written offers to each counsel today. Those will\nremain open until the next pre-prelim hearing date. The People’s understanding, that\nwould be January 13. I don’t want set beyond that.”\n        The next hearing took place on January 13, 2011. Palofox’s eventual trial counsel,\ndeputy public defender Peter Pacheco, appeared with him in court on this date. The\nhearing began with the prosecutor stating: “There were written offers submitted at the last\npre-preliminary hearing on December 3rd. All of those written offers are being\nwithdrawn this date as per the written offer.” Mr. Pacheco responded, “And the record\nshould note, also, your Honor, on behalf of Mr. Palofox, Mr. Dulce was the attorney of\nrecord previously. I do not know whether Mr. Dulce ever discussed the written offer\n\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fwith Mr. Palofox. However, I am substituting in today for the public defender and I\nguess I’ll need to talk to the DA concerning the written offer.”2\n       The next mention in the record of plea bargaining is found within the transcript of\na hearing held on October 24, 2011. Mr. Pacheco and Palofox were present in court\nwhen the following statements were made:\n\n       Trial Court: “One last thing before I go off the record completely, I want to say\n                    this with the defendants present. We’ve had some discussion in\n                    chambers about the settlement offers that have been made by the\n                    People pursuant to a letter that I understand was provided to all\n                    counsel [i.e., the December 2010 written offer]. Although this may\n                    have been a letter that was provided so early on that some of you\n                    attorneys were not actually counsel of record at this particular point\n                    in time when this was done, it was – as I understand it from you,\n                    [prosecutor], this was a letter that was sent by the District Attorney’s\n                    office making an offer of possible disposition of this case to the\n                    defendants based on a term of years. And it was conveyed before\n                    this case went to grand jury indictment, correct?\n\n       Prosecutor:   That’s correct.\n\n       Trial Court: And from the People’s point of view, at least at the moment, those\n                    offers are considered having been rejected?\n\n       Prosecutor:   That’s correct.\n\n       Trial Court: I’m not going to inquire on the record whether any of you counsel\n                    agree with that interpretation. But I do want to say, and I don’t want\n                    there to be any misunderstanding about this subject, the People have\n                    alleged a gang enhancement on alleged home invasion robberies.\n                    And I think it is understood by all counsel here that at least under\n                    [section] 186.22(b)(4) –\n\n       Prosecutor:   Correct.\n\n       Trial Court: – the penalty for that is 15 years to life in the state prison? No\n                    misunderstanding about that?\n\n       2The written offer does not appear in the record, but the parties agree that Palofox\nwould have been able to plea out for a fixed term of 16 years and 8 months in prison. As\nnoted above, he was ultimately sentenced to an indeterminate term of 30 years to life.\n\n\n                                             8.\n\f       Prosecutor:   That’s correct.\n       The trial court made another reference to the expired December 2010 offer at a\nhearing held on January 6, 2012. Further settlement discussions occurred during\nproceedings conducted on March 29, 2012 and April 12, 2012. Mr. Pacheco and Palofox\nwere present in court on each of these dates.\n       On April 19, 2012, Mr. Pacheco made statements in court upon which Palofox\nnow bases his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We reproduce here the relevant\nportion of the transcript from that hearing:\n\n       Trial Court: And, um, the [current settlement] offer to Mr. Palofox, is it\n                    [33 years]?\n\n       Prosecutor:   It is, Your Honor.\n\n       Trial Court: It is with the 45-year-to-life exposure. That’s you, sir? You\n                    understand all of this?\n\n       Palofox:      Yes, I do.\n\n       Trial Court: You’ve had a chance to talk to Mr. Pacheco about, you know, what\n                    you have at risk, what the case looks like. And you know what the\n                    People’s offer is –\n\n       Palofox:      Yes.\n\n       Trial Court: – right? And you made a decision?\n\n       Palofox:      Yes, I have.\n\n       Trial Court: What do you want to do, sir?\n\n       Palofox:      Take it to trial.\n\n       Trial Court: You are satisfied you know what this – what this means, right?\n\n       Palofox:      Yes, I do.\n\n       Trial Court: And Mr. Pacheco, you are satisfied that Mr. Palofox here knows\n                    what he’s got at risk and is making a reasoned decision in this\n                    matter?\n\n\n\n                                               9.\n\f       Pacheco:      Yes, Your Honor. There was a little wrinkle that we discussed\n                     yesterday. When this case was first assigned it was assigned to\n                     Roberto Dulce. And it was [assigned] to Kathy Marousek. It was –\n                     both left on stress leave. I inherited this case. As [to] the [offer of]\n                     16 years eight months, I believe that was a time sensitive letter that I\n                     was never, um – let’s say due to the transfer of the case to myself\n                     there was an issue whether that was conveyed to Mr. Palofox,\n                     whether it was time sensitive. Um-\n\n       Trial Court: Well –\n\n       Pacheco:      However, that’s the only thing I want to put on the record.\n\n       Trial Court: And I’ve allowed you to put it on the record and you have. But from\n                    your point of view, what does it mean? Should the court do\n                    something?\n\n       Pacheco:      Well, I just wanted the People to know he would have accepted the\n                     16 years, eight months, but for the fact that it was time sensitive.\n                     And he was not advised of that by [his] prior [] counsel. We’re\n                     ready to go on the 21st.\n\n       Trial Court: Anything you want to say about that?\n\n       Prosecutor:   Just that I put all these offers on the record including the time\n                     sensitive nature of them for everyone to hear.\n\n       Trial Court: In other words, you made – you didn’t just send a letter. You\n                    actually stated it in court?\n\n       Prosecutor:   I did both, yes.\n       Palofox’s contention on appeal is that his attorneys failed to make him aware of\nthe time-sensitive nature of the December 2010 offer before it expired. He further\nsubmits that he would have accepted the offer had he known it would only be available\nfor a limited time. The remedy sought is reversal and remand, with an order requiring the\nprosecution to “reoffer” the original plea deal.\nAnalysis\n       “To demonstrate that a defendant has received constitutionally inadequate\nrepresentation by counsel, he or she must show that (1) counsel’s representation was\n\n\n\n                                             10.\n\fdeficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms; and (2) counsel’s deficient performance subjected the defendant to\nprejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s failings, the result\nwould have been more favorable to the defendant.” (In re Alvernaz (1992) 2 Cal.4th 924,\n936-937.) Proof of a defense attorney’s failure to adequately advise his or her client\nabout the terms of an offered plea bargain satisfies the element of deficient performance.\n(Id. at p. 937.) To show prejudice in this context, an appellant must further prove there is\na reasonable probability he or she would have accepted the plea bargain but for counsel’s\nsubpar representation. (Ibid.)\n       Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel made on direct appeal are disfavored\nand often unsuitable for review. (People v. Duff (2014) 58 Cal.4th 527, 550, fn. 9 (Duff).\n[“It is rarely appropriate to resolve an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal….”];\nPeople v. Mai (2013) 57 Cal.4th 986, 1009 (Mai).) This is particularly true when, as\nhere, elements of the claim cannot be established without further investigation and/or\nconsideration of evidence outside the record. (People v. Williams (2013) 56 Cal.4th 630,\n691.) The appropriate avenue for relief is a petition for writ of habeas corpus. (Id. at pp.\n690-691, 693.)\n       The record before us contains no explanations by attorneys Wong or Dulce of\nwhat they did or did not do during the relevant time period. Mr. Pacheco’s measured\nstatements to the trial court on April 19, 2012 avoided the issue of his own performance\non January 13, 2011, when the prosecution’s original offer had apparently not yet\nexpired. Palofox never presented his side of the story, and does not explain how he\nremained unaware of the time-sensitive nature of the plea offer when he was present in\ncourt during both the December 3, 2010 and January 13, 2011 hearings.3 We cannot\n\n\n\n       3We note Palofox filed a notice of appeal with an attachment containing a\nhandwritten message which reads: “I would really like to appeal on the fact that due to\n\n                                              11.\n\fsimply take it on faith that he received deficient performance and was prejudiced. The\nineffective assistance claim fails for lack of affirmative proof of these elements.\n   II. Wheeler/Batson Motion\n       Leon alleges error in the prosecution’s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse an\nAfrican-American prospective juror. The issue was raised below by Centeno’s trial\ncounsel, who made an objection pursuant to the holdings of People v. Wheeler (1978)\n22 Cal.3d 258 (Wheeler) and Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson). The other\ndefense attorneys joined in the objection, and Leon’s counsel unsuccessfully moved to\nremedy the alleged error. Centeno, Palofox, and Rivas now summarily join in Leon’s\narguments on appeal. We find no error.\nBackground\n       Jury selection began with a venire of 18 prospective jurors whose racial and ethnic\nbackgrounds are, for the most part, indiscernible from the record. Two members of the\noriginal panel were excused by the trial court during its initial round of questioning and\nreplaced by other people in the jury pool. Peremptory challenges were made after further\nquestioning by the prosecution and each of the four defense attorneys, which resulted in\nthe removal of seven panel members, each of whom was replaced by a new prospective\njuror. The reconstituted panel included Prospective Juror No. 23, hereafter referred to as\n“Juror 23.”\n       Juror 23 is described in the record as an African-American male. His oral voir\ndire responses disclosed a four-year career as a military police officer and an educational\nbackground that included one year of law school. When asked by the trial court if his\nlegal education might impact his ability to remain impartial, he replied, “No. Actually,\nthe reason I stayed is I keep thinking I would – if I was in [the defendants’] shoes I would\n\n\nthe fact I was not properly addressed with a deal that I would have [benefitted] from, due\nto the fact I was not being represented [by] an attorney!”\n\n\n                                             12.\n\fwant somebody on me because I’ve got all the reasons in the world to get out of this.\nBut, you know, I could be fair.” Leon’s trial counsel sought to clarify the meaning of this\nanswer by asking, “I think you said earlier if – these gentlemen who are on trial here\nwould probably want you as a member of their jury. Now, I’m going to ask you to\ncorrect me if I’m wrong, but – well, do you mean by that that you are going to bend over\nbackwards to favor them?” Juror 23 responded, “No, just be fair. That’s all anybody\nwould want is somebody to be fair.”\n       The other defense attorneys questioned Juror 23 about a variety of topics including\nhis views on a defendant’s decision not to testify, the reliability of eyewitness testimony,\nthe reliability of confessions made by suspects to police, and the prosecution’s burden of\nproof. He indicated that a defendant’s decision not to testify would have no impact on\nhis verdict. Regarding eyewitness accounts, he said, “I believe that the eyewitness\nbelieves what they see … but whether that’s the whole truth of the matter, I’d be able to\nexamine all the evidence to make a determination.” He agreed with the proposition that a\nsuspect could be tricked into confessing to something they did not actually do. When\nasked for his thoughts on the prosecution having the sole burden of proof, he replied, “I\nlove it.”\n       After defense counsel had asked their questions, the prosecution made two\ninquiries of Juror 23. The first called for a yes or no answer regarding whether, if\nnecessary, he could bring himself to find a defendant guilty of a crime. He replied,\n“Won’t be – that won’t be my problem.” The prosecutor then said, “Okay. Um, if the\nevidence proves the defendants are guilty, can you come back with a verdict that says ‘I\nfind you guilty?’” His response was, “Yes, I can.” The prosecution passed on its next\nopportunity to exercise a peremptory challenge, and thereafter elected to remove Juror 23\nfrom the panel.\n       The defense objected to the prosecution’s challenge on grounds that Juror 23\n“seemed as down the line and fair as it could get,” was “a person of a particular protected\n\n                                             13.\n\fclass,” and was allegedly one of only two African-American members of the prospective\njuror panel. The Wheeler/Batson motion prompted the following exchange between the\nprosecutor and the trial court:\n\n       Trial Court: [L]et me just ask, first of all, from your point of view, has the prima\n                    facie showing been made? And do you want to be heard with\n                    respect to [Centeno’s attorney’s] representation about the racial\n                    composite of the prospective jurors?\n\n       Prosecutor:   Sure.\n\n       Trial Court: Composition, I should say.\n\n       Prosecutor:   Yes. As I currently have seen, there’s three – there were three\n                     potential jurors in the box that appeared to be African-American.\n                     One is [Prospective Juror No. 10]. The other is [Prospective Juror\n                     No. 30], both of which are still on the panel. The prosecution has\n                     passed as to those two jurors. Um, as to [Juror] 23, the prosecution,\n                     even though I don’t feel a prima facie case has been shown in any\n                     regard, I’ll still offer my reasons.\n\n       Trial Court: Good. Go ahead.\n\n       Prosecutor:   The reason why the prosecution thanked and excused him is for two\n                     reasons. One, he said he had completed a year of law school, and\n                     I’m suspicious of people with a little limited amount of legal training\n                     being left on the jury. Secondly, he volunteered that if he were in\n                     their shoes, and he looked over towards the defendants, he would\n                     want someone like himself on the jury. Now, I understand he\n                     rehabilitated himself in his answers, but that still goes a long way\n                     towards what I believe his initial state of mind was.\n       Next, the trial court addressed the defense attorneys: “Without having concluded,\nas the People have allowed, that there is a prima facie showing here, um, why isn’t that a\nlegitimate reason, the very last thing you heard [the prosecutor] say?” Centeno’s attorney\nsubmitted, without further explanation, that he believed the prosecutor’s challenge was\nracially motivated. Rivas’s lawyer opined that Juror 23’s voir dire responses were\nindicative of fairness and impartiality. Leon’s trial counsel said, “I think there are a\nnumber of people who have told us they had a little bit of legal training that [the\n\n\n                                             14.\n\fprosecution] has passed on. I’m just looking at his sheet; that would include [Prospective\nJuror No. 5]. But a number of people know attorneys or have taken a certain amount of\nlegal education. And [the prosecution] passed on those. And I think that [Juror] 23 was\nrehabilitated in response to – I mean I think that [he] was rehabilitated – was sufficiently\nrehabilitated.” Counsel for Palofox joined in the argument regarding “rehabilitation.”\nAfter considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled as follows:\n\n               I guess all of you are [using the term] rehabilitated – this isn’t a challenge\n       for cause. The fundamental issue before the court is if there’s a prima facie\n       showing that this was a race-based challenge. [The People have conceded] that\n       there is some possible construct of the circumstances [that] might allow for that\n       conclusion. Although it’s the court’s view that – that there is at least one other\n       African-American remaining on the jury on which the People have passed.\n\n              Nevertheless, accepting that this – some court might conclude that there has\n       been a prima facie showing, its seems to me that the issue before this court now is\n       whether there is a neutral ground for – non race-based ground for the prosecution\n       to have exercised that peremptory challenge. And the court is not entitled to\n       reweigh that judgment, no more than the court’s entitled to weigh [] your\n       judgments about the exercise of peremptory challenges. The only real question\n       before the court is whether the court is to disbelieve [] the People’s grounds and\n       find there really isn’t any basis in the record here to support the People’s purported\n       grounds for exercising that peremptory challenge.\n\n              I think under the circumstances there is sufficient demonstration to the\n       court’s satisfaction that there are neutral grounds for the exercise of [the]\n       peremptory challenge. So I’m denying the motion with respect to Wheeler. And\n       that’s why I, frankly, after everything I heard I did not suggest to [Juror] 23 that he\n       should have a seat here in case that the defense might be seeking to reseat him as\n       opposed to starting the whole panel over. But nevertheless the motion is denied.\nAnalysis\n       State and federal law prohibits the use of peremptory challenges to strike\nprospective jurors on the basis of race or ethnicity. (People v. Avila (2006) 38 Cal.4th\n491, 541, citing Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 88; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-\n277.) A three-step procedure is used to evaluate allegations of such discrimination.\n“First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‘by showing that the totality of the\n\n\n                                             15.\n\frelevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.’ [Citation.] Second,\nonce the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the ‘burden shifts to the State to\nexplain adequately the racial exclusion’ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications\nfor the strikes. [Citations.] Third, ‘[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial\ncourt must then decide … whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial\ndiscrimination.’” (Johnson v. California (2005) 545 U.S. 162, 168, fn. omitted.)\n       The parties disagree about whether the existence of a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination is reviewable since the trial judge considered arguments pertaining to the\nthird stage of the Wheeler/Batson analysis. The rule is that “[w]hen a trial court solicits\nan explanation of the strike without first declaring its views on the first stage, we infer an\n‘implied prima facie finding’ of discrimination and proceed directly to review of the\nultimate question of purposeful discrimination.” (People v. Scott (2015) 61 Cal.4th 363,\n387, fn. 1.) Here, the trial court’s equivocal assessment of the threshold question likely\nresulted in an implied prima facie finding. We thus focus on the third stage of the\nanalysis, where “‘the issue comes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutor’s\nrace-neutral explanations to be credible.’” (People v. Lenix (2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 613\n(Lenix), quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell (2003) 537 U.S. 322, 339.)\n       Our review of the trial court’s ruling examines “only whether substantial evidence\nsupports its conclusions.” (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) We presume the\nprosecution used its peremptory challenges in a lawful manner and accord “great\ndeference to the trial court’s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.”\n(People v. Burgener (2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 864.) “So long as the trial court makes a\nsincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications offered, its\nconclusions are entitled to deference on appeal.” (Ibid.)\n       The prosecution’s stated reasons for challenging Juror 23 were (1) an aversion to\njurors who possess a “limited amount of legal training” and (2) suspicion of the\nprospective juror’s bias in favor of the defense. Attorneys have the right to strike a\n\n                                              16.\n\fprospective juror “based upon facial expressions, gestures, hunches, and even for\narbitrary or idiosyncratic reasons.” (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) Likewise, “the\nlaw recognizes that a peremptory challenge may be predicated on a broad spectrum of\nevidence suggestive of juror partiality. The evidence may range from the obviously\nserious to the apparently trivial, from the virtually certain to the highly speculative.”\n(Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 275.) Under these well-established principles, the\nprosecution offered permissible, race-neutral grounds for exercising its peremptory\nchallenge.\n         Leon’s trial counsel insinuated that the first explanation was pretextual because\nthe prosecution had supposedly passed on several people who had “a little bit of legal\ntraining,” including Prospective Juror No. 5. The record does not support this contention.\nAlthough Prospective Juror No. 5 said that his father was a civil defense attorney, he\nhimself was a community college student who had plans to matriculate to the Academy\nof Art University in San Francisco. When asked about a basic legal concept, this\nprospective juror claimed ignorance of the prosecution’s burden of proof in a criminal\ntrial.\n         At the time of the Wheeler/Batson motion, three other panel members had\nreferenced educational backgrounds that were tangentially related to the field of law.\nProspective Jurors Nos. 11 and 13 studied criminology at the undergraduate level. The\nlatter individual was excused by the trial court and the former was stricken by the defense\nduring the first round of peremptory challenges. Prospective Juror No. 30 was pursuing a\ndegree in criminal justice. This panel member was also African-American and ultimately\nserved on the jury.\n         Leon points out that no challenges were made against Alternate Juror No. 45, who\nwas added to the panel after the denial of the Wheeler/Batson motion, despite that juror’s\ncareer as a workers’ compensation attorney. This fact is of questionable relevance since\nthe prosecution was allegedly concerned about people with a “limited amount of legal\n\n                                              17.\n\ftraining,” not licensed professionals who had obtained a J.D. and been admitted to the\nstate bar. To the extent the record allows for a comparative juror analysis, such analysis\ndoes not support appellants’ claim of racial discrimination. (See Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat p. 607 [“Comparative juror analysis is evidence that, while subject to inherent\nlimitations, must be considered when reviewing claims of error at Wheeler/Batson’s third\nstage when the defendant relies on such evidence and the record is adequate to permit the\ncomparisons.”].)\n       The prosecutor’s explanation regarding a suspicion of Juror 23’s bias towards the\ndefense was not without evidentiary support. Juror 23 provided a number of ambiguous\nand unusual answers to questions designed to gauge his impartiality, including the\nresponse of “I love it,” when asked about the prosecution’s burden of proof. He was also\nthe only person to speak up when defense counsel asked the panel if any of them believed\nlaw enforcement officers might lie when giving testimony; he said, “I believe that.”\nAlthough Leon insists Juror 23 was an ideal candidate for jury service, the moving\nparty’s favorable opinion of a challenged panelist is not proof that a prosecutor’s race-\nneutral justifications are pretextual. (See People v. Hensley (2014) 59 Cal.4th 788, 803\n[“The fact that the objector thinks his opponent should feel comfortable with the\ncandidate is not the relevant question. The question is whether the advocate exercising\nthe challenge had an honest and racially neutral reason for doing so.”].) Given the\nplausibility of the prosecutor’s explanations, we must defer to the trial court’s assessment\nof their genuineness. (People v. Silva (2001) 25 Cal.4th 345, 385-386.)\n       It is also significant that the prosecution made no attempt to challenge Prospective\nJuror No. 30, who was reportedly of the same race as Juror 23. “Although not\nconclusive, the fact that the jury included a member of the group allegedly discriminated\nagainst ‘is an indication of good faith in exercising peremptories.’” (People v. Johnson\n(2015) 61 Cal.4th 734, 760.) This consideration, combined with the factual\ncircumstances discussed above, leads us to conclude the challenged ruling is supported\n\n                                            18.\n\fby substantial evidence. Therefore, we will not reverse the trial court’s denial of the\nWheeler/Batson motion.\n   III.      Admissibility of Leon’s Custodial Statements to Police\n       Leon made incriminating statements during a recorded interview with law\nenforcement officials on the day of his arrest. A partial audio recording of that interview\nwas played for the jury during the prosecution’s case-in-chief. Although the\nadmissibility of Leon’s confession was not contested at trial, he now asserts that his\nstatements were induced by implied promises of leniency. To circumvent forfeiture of\nthis argument, he alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial attorney’s\nfailure to dispute the voluntariness of his statements. The claim fails under the applicable\nstandard of review.\nForfeiture\n       “Evidence Code section 353, subdivision (a) allows a judgment to be reversed\nbecause of erroneous admission of evidence only if an objection to the evidence or a\nmotion to strike it was ‘timely made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of\nthe objection.’” (People v. Demetrulias (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1, 20.) This code section\noperates as a rule of forfeiture (People v. Nelson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 198, 223), even in the\ncontext of a constitutional challenge to the voluntariness of a defendant’s confession\n(People v. Tully (2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 979-980, 983, fn.10 (Tully); People v. Williams\n(2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 435 (Williams).) Leon’s failure to dispute the voluntariness of his\nconfession at trial makes appellate review impractical because “the parties had no\nincentive to fully litigate this theory below, and the trial court had no opportunity to\nresolve material factual disputes and make necessary factual findings.” (People v. Ray\n(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 339.) “Under such circumstances, a claim of involuntariness\ngenerally will not be addressed for the first time on appeal.” (Ibid.) For these reasons,\nLeon’s direct challenge to the admissibility of his confession has been forfeited.\n\n\n\n                                             19.\n\fIneffective Assistance of Counsel\n1. Background\n       Leon and his brother, Eric Rodriguez, were arrested together at their home in\nArizona. They were transported to a local police station in a vehicle equipped with a\nhidden recording device which allowed investigators to hear their conversations with\neach other. Leon told Eric something to the effect of, “Don’t say anything, [just] tell\nthem we went to the beach in California.” When they arrived at police headquarters, the\nbrothers were separated and interrogated. Eric was later brought into Leon’s interview\nroom for joint questioning.\n       After waiving his right to remain silent, Leon responded to questioning by\nDetectives John Willow of the Clovis Police Department, Jon Sims of the Fresno County\nSheriff’s Office, and Dwayne Pavelski of the Merced County Sheriff’s Department. He\nacknowledged taking a road trip to California with a group of people on unspecified\ndates, but said that he could not recall any locations he had visited except for a beach\ntown that began with a “V,” possibly Venice Beach. He feigned ignorance as to why he\nwas being questioned until the detectives told him they were investigating a “crime\nspree” and claimed to “have eyewitnesses that put [him] inside the locations.” Leon\nreacted by saying, “That put me inside? … You got fingerprints though or what? You\ngot proof that I was in there… [?]” After the detectives assured him they had ample\nevidence of his involvement, Leon admitted to participating in the subject events.\n       Leon’s initial admissions were vague. For example, when asked why the group\nhad targeted the home in Clovis, he responded, “I didn’t see no house, I was just right\nthere … I didn’t – I’m telling you right now, I didn’t beat nobody down, I didn’t do\nnothing like that.” He portrayed himself as a peripheral participant in the conspiracy and\ndenied being at three of the five crime scenes. When the detectives pressed him for\ndetails about each incident, he told them, “Honestly, I wanna say like, I didn’t leave all\nthe time, I’m just saying like that one time is when I went and then that one time I was [a]\n\n                                            20.\n\flookout, that’s about it.” He made denials regarding the use of a firearm, but eventually\nadmitted to having a gun in his hand during one of the robberies. By the end of the\ninterview Leon had confessed to being inside of the two homes that were robbed on\nMarch 16, 2010. He and his brother denied having any involvement in the incident that\noccurred at night (i.e., the robbery in Atwater on February 24, 2010).\n       On appeal, Leon claims his trial counsel should have realized the investigators\nmade promises of leniency in exchange for admissions of guilt. He cites first to a\ncomment by Detective Sims during the early stages of the interview: “[W]e’re here to\nhelp you so that we can kind of work as an advocate for the – for you on behalf of the\n[District Attorney], ‘cause the DA wants to, you know, you’ve got this, this, this, this,\nthis, this. Okay, this case, this case, this case, this case. They’ve laid it out.” As the\ninterview progressed, Detective Sims continued to tell Leon that he wanted to “help”\nhim. In the midst of Leon’s denials regarding the use of a gun, the detective said, “Okay,\nlook at me, look at me right in the eyes dude … I need to know this, it’s for you… It’s\nnot for me, it’s for you… help me help you.”\n       Leon also complains of being tricked into believing that expressing remorse would\nengender some form of prosecutorial leniency. Detective Sims urged him to make a\nwritten confession and apology, and said that he would deliver the apology to the district\nattorney. Later, a deputy district attorney from Fresno County named Greg Anderson\ncame into the room and spoke with Leon. The extent of their conversation is unclear\nfrom the record, but the following statements were made concerning the alleged\nsignificance of Leon’s remorse:\n\n       Anderson:      You know, if you have remorse in this case, if you feel remorse for\n                      what you did, okay, let me know, ‘cause that makes a difference.\n                      Okay, there are victims in this case, and they’ve gone through a lot\n                      in this case, um, I know that a number of people in this case have\n                      written letters of apology.\n\n       Leon:          Yeah.\n\n\n                                              21.\n\f       Anderson:     I think that’s a great idea.\n\n       Leon:         Yeah. It’s cause, like – I mean like, I wasn’t planning to do this, I\n                     mean like, I was just like, I was like, I went with them, they’re like\n                     ‘hey, we’re gonna do this’ – so I was just like –\n\n       Anderson:     Yeah, you got caught up in it, you got caught up in the robberies, the\n                     next thing you know it’s happening.\n\n       Leon:         Yeah, yeah.\n\n       Anderson:     If you feel bad about that, this is the time to write that letter, okay?\n                     Because that’s what’s gonna tell the judge and the jury and the\n                     people that you feel bad about it. Okay? And that’s – that’s not a\n                     bad thing, that means you have a conscience. Alright? Which is a\n                     good thing.\n       Following his statements about remorse, Mr. Anderson made the following\nremarks: “I may want you to talk to your brother. ‘Cause your brother ain’t seeing the\nlight. Okay? For some reason when you guys initially had that talk – ok, he’s like no I\nnever was there. Nothing ever happened and everything… and the problem is he’s the\nonly one who is doing that. So if anyone is going down it’s him which is kinda sad.”\n(Original ellipsis.) Leon urges us to interpret the last statement as “implying that\nconfessing meant not going down.” (Original italics.)\n2. Analysis\n       We have already explained that an appellant must establish two things in order to\nprevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim: (1) the performance of his or her\nattorney fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) prejudice occurred as\na result. (Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687 (Strickland); People v.\nAnderson (2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 569.) Leon’s briefs gloss over the first prong of the\nanalysis, but we are inclined to agree with respondent that the required showing has not\nbeen made. In any event, the claim fails due to Leon’s inability to establish prejudice.\n       “When examining an ineffective assistance claim, a reviewing court defers to\ncounsel’s reasonable tactical decisions, and there is a presumption counsel acted within\n\n\n                                             22.\n\fthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance. It is particularly difficult to prevail\non an appellate claim of ineffective assistance. On direct appeal, a conviction will be\nreversed for ineffective assistance only if (1) the record affirmatively discloses counsel\nhad no rational tactical purpose for the challenged act or omission, (2) counsel was asked\nfor a reason and failed to provide one, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory\nexplanation.” (Mai, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 1009.) “All other claims of ineffective\nassistance are more appropriately resolved in a habeas corpus proceeding.” (Ibid.)\n       Leon’s arguments speak to the disputed existence of a factual and legal basis for\nmoving to suppress his custodial statements. “There may be cases, however, where for\ntactical reasons counsel foregoes [sic] making a motion [to suppress] even though the\nmotion has merit.” (People v. Gonzalez (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 432, 437, fn. 1\n(Gonzalez).) On the one hand, a defendant’s own confession is generally considered to\nbe the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him. (Skilling\nv. United States (2010) 561 U.S. 358, 383.) On the other hand, Leon’s interview\ncontained numerous denials and mitigating statements. Respondent argues that\nindependent evidence of Leon’s participation in the robberies was strong enough to\njustify a strategic decision to allow his interview statements to come into evidence. In\nother words, defense counsel may have perceived a legitimate benefit in allowing the jury\nto hear Leon deny and/or minimize his role in most of the crimes without having to\nsubject him to cross-examination on the witness stand. (See People v. Kelly (1992)\n1 Cal.4th 495, 521-523 [“Counsel had to make the difficult decision whether on balance\nthe defense would benefit from the jury hearing the tape of defendant’s confession as part\nof the prosecution case-in-chief at the guilt phase. This is precisely the type of tactical\ndecision defense counsel must be allowed to make without fear of appellate second-\nguessing…”].]\n       Respondent supports its position by citing to testimony by the victim of the\nMarch 16, 2010 robbery in Atwater, who claimed to be “one hundred percent” certain\n\n                                             23.\n\fthat Leon was one of the perpetrators who entered his home. The Attorney General\nfurther notes: “Just a few hours after the fifth robbery on McCall Avenue [in Selma],\nLeon and his green Tahoe were both photographed with a group that included\ncoconspirator Beltran, who later pawned a ring stolen in that robbery. In addition, a cell\nphone registered to someone with Leon’s Arizona home address was in the vicinity of all\nfive robberies, while in frequent contact with phones belonging to codefendant Rivas and\ncoconspirators Landeros and Zazueta.” Thus, given the probability of Leon’s conviction\non the counts relating to the two robberies on March 16, 2010, defense counsel could\nhave reasonably concluded that the exculpatory value of his statements about the other\ncrimes outweighed the damaging impact of his admissions.\n       Respondent’s theory is plausible, especially in light of the jury’s verdict. The\ndefense evidence consisted of employment records which ostensibly showed that Leon\nwas in Arizona on February 24, 2010 when the first two robberies were committed.\nHowever, eyewitnesses from both of those incidents not only identified him as one of the\nperpetrators, but also claimed he was the man who viciously attacked an occupant of the\nhouse in Atwater. In light of the conflicting evidence, Leon’s attorney may have wanted\nthe jury to hear his client’s denials in order to bolster his alibi. If this was counsel’s\nstrategy, it is entirely possible that Leon benefited from it since the jury acquitted him of\nall counts arising from the February 24, 2010 robberies.\n       In his reply brief, Leon counters that the potential consequences of true findings\non the gang enhancement allegations negated any strategic benefit of forgoing a motion\nto suppress the interview statements. To accept this argument, we would have to\nspeculate as to defense counsel’s overall assessment of the evidence and his belief in the\nprobability of success at the bifurcated trial on the gang issues. “[W]here counsel’s trial\ntactics or strategic reasons for challenged decisions do not appear on the record, we will\nnot find ineffective assistance of counsel on [direct] appeal unless there could be no\nconceivable reason for counsel’s acts or omissions.” (People v. Weaver (2001)\n\n                                              24.\n\f26 Cal.4th 876, 926.) Leon has not demonstrated that there could be no conceivable\nreason for his trial attorney’s performance in regards to the custodial interview evidence.\nHis claim fails for this reason alone.\n       Were we to assume Leon could clear the first hurdle of the Strickland test, he\nwould still have to show prejudice. “To establish prejudice, however, the defendant must\ndo more than show the motion [his attorney neglected to make] would have been\nmeritorious. When the alleged deficiency is the failure to make a suppression motion, the\ndefendant must show, in addition, the motion would have been successful.” (Gonzalez,\nsupra, 64 Cal.App.4th at p. 438.) Such a showing cannot be made on the present record.\n       According to Leon, a motion to suppress his interview statements would have\nsucceeded on grounds of involuntariness. “‘In general, a confession is considered\nvoluntary “if the accused’s decision to speak is entirely ‘self-motivated’ [citation], i.e., if\nhe freely and voluntarily chooses to speak without ‘any form of compulsion or promise of\nreward. . . .’ [Citation.]” [Citation.] However, where a person in authority makes an\nexpress or clearly implied promise of leniency or advantage for the accused which is a\nmotivating cause of the decision to confess, the confession is involuntary and\ninadmissible as a matter of law.’” (Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at pp. 985-986.) Leon’s\nargument thus raises two distinct questions: were there any promises of leniency, and if\nso, were they the “motivating cause” of his decision to admit guilt? (People v. Linton\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 1146, 1176 (Linton); Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 986.) To answer\nthese questions we must evaluate the totality of the circumstances, keeping in mind that\nthe prosecution need only prove voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.\n(Tully, at pp. 986, 993.)\n       We consider first Detective Sims’s stated intention to act as an “advocate” for\nLeon and to “help” him. Such use of the term “help” does not necessarily constitute an\nimplied promise of leniency. (People v. Vance (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1212 [no\nimplied promise of leniency in detective saying “[w]e are here to listen and then to help\n\n                                              25.\n\fyou out.”].) Detective Sims may have pushed the envelope by calling himself an\nadvocate, but the vagueness of his statements and lack of any specified terms of quid pro\nquo weigh against a finding of an improper promise. (See People v. Jones (1998)\n17 Cal.4th 279, 297-298 [“the detective’s offers of intercession with the district attorney\namounted to truthful implications that his cooperation might be useful in later plea\nbargain negotiations”]; People v. Higareda (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1399, 1409\n[investigating officer promised nothing more than to speak with the prosecutor if\ndefendant was truthful]; cf. People v. Cahill (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 296, 314 (Cahill)\n[implied promises of leniency found where detectives claimed they were trying to help\nthe defendant and represented that he could avoid a first degree murder conviction by\nadmitting guilt and denying premeditation].)\n       There is, of course, a fine line “between urging a suspect to tell the truth by\nfactually outlining the benefits that may flow from confessing, which is permissible, and\nimpliedly promising lenient treatment in exchange for a confession, which is not.”\n(People v. Holloway (2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 117 (Holloway).) Detective Sims and deputy\ndistrict attorney Greg Anderson both treaded close to this line by emphasizing the\nsupposed importance of Leon’s willingness to show remorse. However, the California\nSupreme Court has said “there is nothing improper in pointing out that a jury probably\nwill be more favorably impressed by a confession and a show of remorse than by\ndemonstrably false denials.” (Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 444.) The interrogators\ndid not phrase their statements exactly in this way, but they arguably refrained from\nimplying anything more than the benefits that flow naturally from a truthful and honest\ncourse of conduct. (See Holloway, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 116; People v. Andersen\n(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 563, 579 [“statements of police officers to the effect that a\nshowing of remorse is a factor which mitigates punishment” are not improper].)\n       As for the remark about Leon’s brother being the only one “going down,” the\nstatement must be read in context. (See People v. Carrington (2009) 47 Cal.4th 145, 170\n\n                                             26.\n\f(Carrington).) It does not appear Mr. Anderson was attempting to elicit further\nadmissions from Leon. He was most likely trying to increase the chances that Leon’s\nbrother would also provide incriminating statements. We do not interpret the ambiguous\ncomment as implying a benefit to Leon in exchange for Leon’s own admissions.\n       To the extent any of the challenged statements can be construed as improper\npromises, Leon has not established the element of causation. This is due in part to his\nfailure to provide an adequate record, which is admittedly a consequence of the issue\nnever being litigated at trial (and underscores why the claim should have been raised, if at\nall, by way of a habeas corpus petition). He presents us with two alternate transcripts of\nhis interview, but both are redacted and show gaps of unknown length between various\nquestions and answers. Each version contains material not present in the other, with\nsome statements being cut off in mid-sentence. We cannot conduct a proper analysis\nwithout knowing facts such as the amount of time that elapsed between the alleged\npromises of leniency and Leon’s statements of admission, and whether intervening\nquestions or discussions may have had a causal effect on his decision to reveal certain\ninformation.\n       Notwithstanding the incomplete record, we are unconvinced that the alleged\npromises of leniency were the motivating cause of Leon’s admissions. He seems instead\nto have been affected by the extent of the investigators’ knowledge of the crimes and a\ndesire to separate himself from those whose involvement in the conspiracy was allegedly\nmore extensive and egregious than his own. Accordingly, and for the reasons explained\nabove, the claim must be rejected.\n   IV. Admissibility of Centeno’s Custodial Statements to Police\n       Centeno also disputes the voluntariness of a confession he made to law\nenforcement officers during a custodial interview. Like Leon, he argues his incriminating\nstatements were induced by promises of leniency. The parties seem to agree that the\nissue was not preserved for appellate review. The claim is therefore characterized as one\n\n                                            27.\n\fof ineffective assistance of counsel. Based on the limited evidence in the record, Centeno\ncannot satisfy his burden of demonstrating a causal connection between the alleged\npromises of leniency and his admissions of guilt. We are thus constrained to uphold the\njudgment regardless of whether any improper promises were made during his\ninterrogation.\nBackground\n       Centeno was interrogated at a juvenile detention facility in Arizona. According to\nhis probation report, he was being held at the facility on unrelated charges when\ndetectives spoke with him about the events in this case. His age at the time of the\ninterrogation was approximately 17 years and 5 months.\n       Our knowledge of what occurred during the custodial interview is limited to the\ncontents of a 20-page transcript containing portions of the questioning, but the transcript\nhas been redacted to an unknown degree. The length of the interview is also unknown.\nThe entire session was reportedly documented in an audio recording, but we have only\nheard a 29-minute excerpt that was played for the jury, which corresponds to a slightly\ndifferent and shorter transcript used at trial.4\n       The material in the record begins during a question and answer session between\nCenteno and Detective Alexander Archuleta of the Phoenix Police Department, then\nseemingly cuts to Detective Dwayne Pavelski advising the suspect of his Miranda rights\n(Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436 (Miranda)). After Centeno confirms his\nunderstanding of the Miranda advisement, Detective Pavelski transitions into series of\nnarratives which include anecdotes from his own life, commentary about the criminal\n\n\n       4 Neither Leon nor Centeno designated the partial audio recordings of their police\ninterviews for inclusion in the record on appeal. Those items, respectively marked as\nPeople’s Exhibits Nos. 621 and 623, were transmitted at our request. (Cal. Rules of\nCourt, rules 8.224(d) [transmission of exhibits] and 8.320(e) [exhibits admitted in\nevidence are deemed part of the record in a criminal appeal].)\n\n\n                                              28.\n\fjustice system, and contentions regarding the importance of a forthright confession. His\nlengthy statements are separated by Centeno’s occasional responses of “Mm-hmm” and\n“Yeah.” In the edited audio recording, approximately 14 minutes of such exchanges\nprecede Centeno’s disclosure of information about the conspiracy and acknowledgment\nof his role in two of the robberies.\n       Centeno claims Detective Pavelski promised him leniency in exchange for\nadmissions by saying things like, “I’m the guy that steps in and actually works to defend\nyou, in a way…” and “I need your side of the story so I can speak for you.” Centeno\nfurther objects to certain misrepresentations about the legal consequences of his actions.\nThese arguments are based on the following excerpts:\n\n       Pavelski:      […] I believe in getting the truth, because if you shut down and tell\n                      me, ‘I’m not saying nothing to you,’ that means I can’t get up and\n                      speak for you and say, ‘this, no – this is what actually happened.’\n                      Because I can prove everything.\n\n       Centeno:       Yeah.\n\n       Pavelski:      They’ve already done it. That’s why I’m here now. My job is to get\n                      up and say, ‘look, Victor did take part in something, he fucked up,’\n                      I’m not gonna say that in court, but –\n\n       Centeno:       Say I messed up.\n\n       Pavelski:      Yeah. I’m gonna say, you know, he – he made a bad decision\n                      because he’s a juvenile for one, but this is what actually happened,\n                      he was, he shows that he can be rehabilitated because he was honest\n                      and he actually told the truth about everything that happened. He\n                      was sorry for what he did. He was influenced by his friends or\n                      something like that. […] Um, and, you know, it comes to mind, do\n                      you even realize, has anybody ever told you why juveniles are\n                      separated from adults? Why you go to a different jail?\n\n       Centeno:       Nah.\n\n       Pavelski:      It’s not just because you’re under eighteen. That’s just a formality.\n                      The real-\n\n\n\n                                             29.\n\fCenteno:    Probably influenced by them.\n\nPavelski:   Not even that. It’s because the state of Arizona, actually, it’s every\n            state in the United States, believes that a minor can be reabil –\n            rehabilitated. That’s why your guys’ sentences for whatever crime is\n            different. They don’t just smack three years on you for something.\n            They – they look at, is he able to be rehabilitated, and then they base\n            your sentence on your personality, what it is you did, how you\n            cooperated with cops, how you talk, how you present yourself, and\n            that kinda deal. And then they go, okay, does this guy need\n            probation or does he need some jail time, and while he’s in jail, he’ll\n            probably have to do these classes, all that kinda stuff.\n\nCenteno:    Mm-hmm.\n\nPavelski:   Because they want to see that you are able to be reab – rehabilitated\n            so they can put you in society and you’re gonna be productive and\n            lead a good life at some point. […]\n            So, that’s why I need your truth, because everybody else has talked.\n            And I’ve told everybody the same thing, that I talked to, is, we\n            didn’t come from California because we think we – you did it, we\n            came because we know you did it, and that’s not even a question, I\n            can see you’re agreeing with me by nodding your head.\n\nCenteno:    Yeah.\n\nPavelski:   Um, my job here is to make sure I get your side of it. About all of it.\n            So I know that when things go to court, I’m going ‘no, he shouldn’t\n            get charged with that,’ or the DA’s office will go ‘no, he shouldn’t\n            get charged with that, he shouldn’t get charged with that.’ Um,\n            matter of fact, we have a DA that I can talk to, and that will talk to\n            you, when we’re done, to let you know, like, okay, hey, this is\n            what’s happening, but um, he comes because I come. Because I’m\n            the one, the guys at work always freaking make fun of me, they\n            think I picked the wrong occupation, I shoulda been a freaking\n            lawyer, but, because I want to be able to present you as the kid that\n            made the mistake that’s gonna be rehabilitated, not the kid that is the\n            hardened criminal, that went [unintelligible].\n\nCenteno:    Yeah.\n\nPavelski    Um, it would benefit you to be as detailed as you could with me, and\n            I also wanna know how you were feeling during all this time. […]\n\n\n\n                                   30.\n\f       On the eighth day of trial, Centeno’s attorney, Linden Lindahl, requested a hearing\npursuant to Evidence Code section 402 to determine the validity of his client’s Miranda\nwaiver. Before the hearing started, the trial court said, “Counsel, just to clarify here, this\nis a very limited issue which, although I think to some degree defense has earlier waived,\nwe’re going to allow it to be heard in any event having to do with the admissibility of\nMr. Centeno’s statement, whether he was properly Mirandized and his statement was\notherwise voluntary. Just that limited subject.” The hearing itself consisted of testimony\nfrom Detective Pavelski, who was briefly questioned about the Miranda advisement.\nMr. Lindahl’s questions focused on the detective’s failure to solicit an explicit waiver\nfrom Centeno after Centeno said that he understood his rights.\n       At the conclusion of Detective Pavelski’s testimony, Mr. Lindahl argued: “Your\nHonor, I would submit that this was not a full and complete Miranda advisement in that\nafter reading the minor at that time his rights, they launched into an interrogation without\nasking him whether he wished to exercise his rights. I feel a combination of the\ndetective’s presence and his youthfulness, it’s my position that [his] will was overborne\nand he wasn’t fully advised. I’d ask his statement be excluded as a Miranda violation.”\nThe prosecution argued that an implied waiver had been made. The trial court ruled as\nfollows: “Under the circumstances, I’m satisfied that the preponderance of the evidence\ndemonstrated that the defendant was advised of his rights and understood them and\nanswered questions voluntarily. And that, therefore, the statements [are] otherwise\nadmissible in the People’s case-in-chief if they seek to use [them]. That’s subject, of\ncourse, to the redactions that I think the two of you have already agreed to.”\nForfeiture\n       When challenged, a Miranda waiver must be “shown by a preponderance of the\nevidence to be voluntary, knowing and intelligent under the totality of the circumstances\nsurrounding the interrogation. [Citations.] The waiver must be ‘voluntary in the sense\nthat it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,\n\n                                             31.\n\for deception’ [citation], and knowing in the sense that it was ‘made with a full awareness\nof both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to\nabandon it.’” (People v. Sauceda-Contreras (2012) 55 Cal.4th 203, 219.) Here, the\nparties’ arguments and the trial court’s analysis focused on the knowing and intelligent\nnature of the Miranda waiver. To the extent the trial court evaluated voluntariness, it did\nso exclusively in regards to the motivation behind Centeno’s initial waiver of his right to\nremain silent, and without consideration of any interrogation tactics employed thereafter.\n       A claim of erroneously admitted evidence is cognizable on appeal only if the\noriginal challenge to the evidence was timely and specific. (Evid. Code, § 353, subd. (a);\nPeople v. Abel (2012) 53 Cal.4th 891, 924 [review of trial court’s admission of evidence\nis limited to the stated grounds for the objection].) Such challenges must be specific\nenough to “fairly inform the trial court, as well as the party offering the evidence, of the\nspecific reason or reasons the objecting party believes the evidence should be excluded,\nso the party offering the evidence can respond appropriately and the court can make a\nfully informed ruling.” (People v. Partida (2005) 37 Cal.4th 428, 435.) Pursuant to these\nrules, “[a] defendant ordinarily forfeits elements of a voluntariness claim that were not\nraised below.” (Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 435.)\n       The trial court was never asked to consider whether Centeno’s admissions were\ninfluenced by promises of leniency, and does not appear to have reviewed any recordings\nor transcripts of the interrogation in conjunction with its ruling on the admissibility of his\nstatements. Centeno all but concedes respondent’s forfeiture argument, emphasizing that\nthe failure to allege promises of leniency as a ground for suppression is the very reason\nwhy his trial attorney’s performance was constitutionally deficient. We agree that the\nissue was forfeited, and will consider the question of voluntariness only within the\ncontext of the ineffective assistance claim.5\n\n       5In this instance, we are not persuaded by respondent’s argument that defense\ncounsel may have “strategically declined to exclude favorable statements” by his client.\n\n                                             32.\n\fAnalysis\n       “The use of deceptive statements during an investigation does not invalidate a\nconfession as involuntary unless the deception is the type likely to procure an untrue\nstatement.” (People v. McCurdy (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1063, 1088.) However,\nmisrepresentations that involve promises of leniency are prohibited. (Cahill, supra,\n22 Cal.App.4th at p. 315.) Detective Pavelski obviously lied to Centeno about being tried\nas a juvenile and receiving more lenient treatment than an adult could expect under the\nsame circumstances. Centeno makes a compelling argument that these tactics were\nimproper, especially when combined with the detective’s insinuation that he had the\nability to influence certain aspects of the case.\n       The challenged comments are fairly interpreted as implying that Detective\nPavelski could play a role in deciding what charges would be filed against Centeno. (Cf.\nCarrington, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 174 [“The interviewing officers did not suggest they\ncould influence the decisions of the district attorney, but simply informed defendant that\nfull cooperation might be beneficial in an unspecified way.”].) The other implication was\nthat Centeno’s punishment would be dependent upon his cooperation with police. The\nrepeated emphasis on “rehabilitation” suggested his sentence would be less harsh if a\njudge found him capable of being rehabilitated, and the clear message was that the\nlikelihood of such a finding would increase if he confessed (in which case the detective\nwould advocate for leniency on his behalf) and decrease if he did not confess.\n       Despite the strength of Centeno’s argument regarding promises of leniency, we are\nunable to conclude that a suppression motion on grounds of involuntariness would have\nbeen successful. The viability of such a motion would have hinged on the element of\n\n\nThe proposition is illogical given the defense attorney’s effort to suppress the statements\non other grounds. Furthermore, unlike Leon, Centeno was not identified by any of the\nvictims. The prosecution’s case against Centeno was entirely circumstantial save for the\nevidence of his admissions during the custodial interview.\n\n\n                                              33.\n\fcausation, i.e., whether an improper promise was the motivating cause of his decision to\nconfess, and no single factor is dispositive of that issue. (People v. Williams (1997)\n16 Cal.4th 635, 661 [rejecting the view that an offer of leniency necessarily renders a\nstatement involuntary].) The ultimate question is “‘whether the defendant’s “will was\noverborne at the time he confessed.”’” (People v. McWhorter (2009) 47 Cal.4th 318,\n346-347 (McWhorter).) To answer this question, we would need to evaluate “the totality\nof all the surrounding circumstances – both the characteristics of the accused and the\ndetails of the interrogation.” (Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973) 412 U.S. 218, 226\n(Schneckloth); accord, Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1176.) Due to the state of the\nrecord, we do not know the totality of the relevant circumstances.\n       The voluntariness of a confession is subject to independent review on direct appeal\nif the relevant facts have been “actually and reliably determined.” (Jackson v. Denno\n(1964) 378 U.S. 368, 380; see People v. Bacon (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1082, 1105 [“we\nindependently determine, from the undisputed facts and facts properly found by the trial\ncourt, whether the challenged statement was illegally obtained.”].) Ordinarily, the facts\nsurrounding a defendant’s confession are considered undisputed if the interrogation was\nmemorialized in an audio or video recording, and it is the undisputed nature of the facts\nthat makes de novo review possible in that scenario. (Duff, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 551.)\nHowever, the recording must be complete or at least substantially reliable in terms of its\nportrayal of the circumstances that led to the defendant’s decision to confess. (See\nMcWhorter, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 347-348 [trial court properly examined the totality\nof the circumstances by viewing recording of police interview in its entirety, not “in\nsnippets or parts”].) Because Centeno’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nrequires analysis of circumstances that are unknown due to evidentiary gaps in the record,\nthe missing evidence must be construed against him. (See People v. Lucas (1995)\n12 Cal.4th 415, 443 [“The sparseness of the record on appeal reflects not the merits of\ndefendant’s voluntariness claim but the reality that the issue was not fully litigated below\n\n                                            34.\n\fand that the People were not put to their burden of proof…. Defendant fails to recognize\nthat the silence of the record works against him…”]; Denham v. Superior Court (1970)\n2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [“‘All intendments and presumptions are indulged to support [the\njudgment] on matters as to which the record is silent, and error must be affirmatively\nshown.’”].)\n       Under the totality of the circumstances test, relevant “characteristics of the\naccused” include the defendant’s age, maturity, education, intelligence, mental health,\nand physical condition at the time of the interrogation. (Schneckloth, supra, 412 U.S. at\np. 226; People v. Boyette (2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 411 (Boyette.) Centeno’s probation\nreport indicates that he was a minor and had only completed the eighth grade. Both of\nthose factors weigh in his favor. On the other hand, he was about seven months away\nfrom his eighteenth birthday and had been arrested four times since the age of 16, which\nsuggests a familiarity with law enforcement procedures and the legal system. The brief\nexcerpt of his interview with Detective Archuleta (prior to his exchanges with Detective\nPavelski) shows him complaining that police officers searched through his cell phone\nduring a recent arrest and questioning whether the searches were allowed without his\npermission. On balance, Centeno appears to be at least moderately intelligent and\ncapable of making rational decisions for himself.\n       Relevant “details of the interrogation” include evidence of the location, length,\nand continuity of the interview, the nature of the questioning (such as aggressive,\nrepeated, or prolonged questioning), the use of physical force or deprivation of food or\nsleep, and the lack of advice as to the defendant’s constitutional rights. (Schneckloth,\nsupra, 412 U.S. at p. 226; Carrington, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 175; Boyette, supra,\n29 Cal.4th at p. 411.) The record discloses little in terms of the setting where Centeno’s\ninterview occurred or the factors of length and continuity. The tone of the interview\nseems calm and conversational. As best we can tell, Centeno waived his rights freely and\nprovided incriminating statements without any hesitation. There are no obvious signs\n\n                                             35.\n\fthat his will to resist confessing was overborne. To the extent the audio recording\nprovides a reliable timeline, he began to admit guilt within 15 minutes of speaking with\nDetective Pavelski.\n       Although promises of leniency are a significant consideration in the overall\nanalysis, we are left with questions regarding the extent to which detectives may have\nrevealed to Centeno what they already knew about the crimes and whether he was\nmotivated by a desire to partially exculpate himself, minimize his involvement, or simply\nclear his conscience. For example, Detective Pavelski makes casual references to a prior\nconversation with “Isabelle,” who is identified elsewhere in the record as Centeno’s\ngirlfriend. We infer from the redacted transcript that Centeno made incriminating\nstatements of remorse to Isabelle, she conveyed some or all of those statements to police,\nand Centeno was aware of this fact at the time of his interview with Detective Pavelski.\nWithout a complete picture of what occurred during his interview, we cannot conclude\nthat his burden of showing reversible error on the basis of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel has been met. (See People v. Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 691 [concluding\nappellant’s ineffective assistance claims “can be fully addressed only in a habeas corpus\npetition because they require investigation of evidence outside the record in order to\npotentially establish prejudice.”].)\n   V. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n       Appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions\nfor assault with a semiautomatic firearm as alleged in Count 13 of the indictment. They\nargue the prosecution failed to establish the semiautomatic characteristics of the\nweapon(s) used in the offense. Rivas additionally argues that his conviction under\nCount 4 for attempting to dissuade a witness within the meaning of section 136.1,\nsubdivision (c)(1) lacks evidentiary support. Respondent concedes only the latter\nargument. We agree with appellants on both issues.\n\n\n\n                                            36.\n\fStandard of Review\n       “To determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, an appellate\ncourt reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine\nwhether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, from which a\nrational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” (People\nv. Kipp (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1100, 1128.) This analysis is applied to every element of the\noffense. (People v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 89.) In considering the\nrecord as a whole, we “‘must accept logical inferences that the jury might have drawn\nfrom the circumstantial evidence.’” (People v. Zamudio (2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 357.)\n“‘A reasonable inference, however, “may not be based on suspicion alone, or on\nimagination, speculation, supposition, surmise, conjecture, or guess work.”’” (People v.\nRaley (1992) 2 Cal.4th 870, 891.)\nAssault with a Semiautomatic Firearm\n       Appellants were accused of committing assault with a semiautomatic firearm in\nviolation of section 245, subdivision (b) against Fernando Guzman. Mr. Guzman was\nvictimized during the robbery that occurred in Atwater on the morning of March 16,\n2010. We suspect the prosecution elected to charge appellants as it did in light of\nMr. Guzman’s testimony before the grand jury, during which he claimed to be\n“experienced with weapons,” confirmed his ability to distinguish between\n“semiautomatic firearms as opposed to revolvers,” and testified to being assaulted with a\n“semiautomatic handgun.” His trial testimony, however, did not include those details.\n       At trial, Mr. Guzman described encountering eight to ten men inside of his home,\nall of whom were armed with handguns, which he referred to as “pistols.” He responded\naffirmatively when the prosecutor asked if he knew the difference between a pistol and a\nrifle, but no further explanation of the term “pistol” was asked for or provided.\nMr. Guzman thereafter testified to being knocked to the ground, beaten, and tied up\nduring the robbery. An unidentified man had stood over him with a “pistol” while he was\n\n                                            37.\n\flying on the floor. He watched as the man “cock[ed] back the gun,” aimed at his leg, and\npulled the trigger. The gun made a “trigger noise” but did not fire.\n       Section 245, subdivision (a)(2) provides: “Any person who commits an assault\nupon the person of another with a firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state\nprison for two, three, or four years….” In comparison, section 245, subdivision (b),\nstates: “Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a\nsemiautomatic firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three,\nsix, or nine years.” (Italics added.) The statute does not define “semiautomatic firearm,”\nbut our Supreme Court has described the term in other contexts as referring to a gun that\n“‘fires once for each pull on the trigger and reloads automatically, but requires the\nshooter to release the trigger lever before another shot can be fired.’” (In re Jorge M.\n(2000) 23 Cal.4th 866, 874, fn. 4, quoting Walter, Rifles of the World (2d ed. 1998)\np. 498.) This broad definition encompasses most types of modern handguns, and\narguably includes revolvers.\n       The jury below was instructed on the elements of assault with a semiautomatic\nfirearm pursuant to CALCRIM No. 875. The instruction reads, in pertinent part: “A\nfirearm is any device designed to be used as a weapon, from which a projectile is\ndischarged or expelled through a barrel by the force of an explosion or other form of\ncombustion. [¶] A semiautomatic pistol extracts a fired cartridge and chambers a fresh\ncartridge with each single pull of the trigger.”\n       The drafters of CALCRIM No. 875 took the definition of a “semiautomatic pistol”\n(italics added) from section 17140, which appears in an unrelated part of the Penal Code\ndevoted to the control of deadly weapons. (Judicial Council of Cal., Crim. Jury Instns.\n(2015) Bench Notes to CALCRIM No. 875, p. 667; see § 16000.) Section 17140 is\nexpressly intended to define “semiautomatic pistol” as that term is used in sections 16900\nand 31910. If section 17140 is applicable to section 245, subdivision (b), then the legal\ndefinition of a “semiautomatic firearm” is narrowed to exclude revolvers. (See People v.\n\n                                             38.\n\fDokins (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1184 [“Unlike semiautomatic weapons, a revolver\ndoes not automatically eject the casings as it is fired.”].) We question whether the\nLegislature intended to make such a nuanced distinction, as it would effectively\nencourage criminals to choose revolvers over of other types of handguns when\ncommitting certain crimes.6 Earlier versions of section 245, subdivision (b) proscribed\nassault with a “semiautomatic rifle,” and the amendment which replaced that term with\n“semiautomatic firearm” was apparently done to broaden the scope of the statute. (Stats\n1993, ch. 369 § 1 (AB 1344) and explanatory notes for same [“substituted ‘firearm’ for\n‘rifle’ after ‘semiautomatic’ wherever it appears in subds (b) and (d)(2)”]; Assem. Com.\non Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1344 (1993–1994 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 13,\n1993.) We need not resolve this question of statutory interpretation since the prosecution\nfailed to introduce any evidence concerning the mechanical operation of the gun or guns\nthat were used in the Count 13 offense.\n       The Attorney General argues that Mr. Guzman’s use of the word “pistol” provided\nsufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude he was assaulted with a semiautomatic\nfirearm under the definition provided in CALCRIM No. 875. She submits that in\ncommon parlance, “a ‘pistol’ is usually, though not always, synonymous with a\nsemiautomatic handgun,” and a revolver is generally not considered to be a type of pistol.\nA number of secondary sources are cited in support of these contentions. Respondent’s\nneed to resort to extrinsic authorities only demonstrates that such matters are not of\nuniversal common knowledge and experience. If Mr. Guzman understood his use of the\nword “pistol” to be synonymous with the legal definition of a “semiautomatic firearm”\n(whatever that may be), it was the prosecution’s burden to elicit that information during\n\n       6 CALCRIM pattern instructions are the official instructions for use in the criminal\ncourts of this state, but “are not themselves the law, and are not authority to establish\nlegal propositions or precedent. … At most, when they are accurate, … they restate the\nlaw.” (People v. Morales (2001) 25 Cal.4th 34, 48, fn. 7; Cal. Rules of Court, rule\n2.1050.)\n\n                                            39.\n\fhis testimony. In the absence of such testimony, and without any further evidence of the\ntype of weapon(s) used, the jury had no basis upon which to conclude beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the victim was assaulted with a semiautomatic firearm.\n       Respondent also argues that the verdict is supported by circumstantial evidence.\nA victim of the second robbery committed on February 24, 2010 (which occurred almost\nthree weeks before the assault of Mr. Guzman) testified to seeing an unidentified\nperpetrator holding a semiautomatic nine-millimeter gun. The victim was able to provide\nthose details because he personally owned the same type of weapon. Elsewhere in the\nrecord is testimony from Deputy Robert Woodrum, who offered hearsay statements about\nhis conversation with a non-victim eyewitness who allegedly claimed to have seen\nEstevan Landeros hand a “silver revolver” to Palofox on one occasion, and also saw\nLanderos in possession of a semiautomatic gun at a hotel on the night of March 16,\n2010.7 Since Landeros was identified as a participant in both the February 24 and\nMarch 16 robberies, respondent infers he likely used a semiautomatic firearm while\nrobbing Mr. Guzman’s home. In addition, Palofox was reportedly found in possession of\na nine-millimeter “semiautomatic pistol” during a traffic stop conducted in Arizona on\nMarch 29, 2010, and police discovered a “.45 caliber semiautomatic Ruger handgun”\nduring a search of his living space in May of that year.\n       The relationship of the facts relied upon by respondent to the assault on\nMr. Guzman are too attenuated to constitute substantial evidence of guilt under\nsection 245, subdivision (b). Even if the necessary inferences could be drawn from those\ncircumstances, the witnesses who made references to “semiautomatic” guns testified in\nnon-expert capacities and offered no insight into their own understanding of that\nterminology. The jury had no way of knowing if any of the weapons used in any of the\n\n       7 Interestingly enough, the eyewitness’s trial testimony described the weapon\ngiven to Palofox as a silver “pistol.” She had no memory of seeing any guns at the\nreferenced hotel.\n\n\n                                            40.\n\frobberies actually satisfied the definition provided in the CALCRIM No. 875 instruction.\nTherefore, appellants’ convictions for assault with a semiautomatic firearm must be\nreversed.\n       Appellants do not otherwise dispute that a firearm was used to assault\nMr. Guzman. Assault with an unspecified type of firearm in violation of section 245,\nsubdivision (a)(2) is a lesser included offense of assault with a semiautomatic firearm as\nproscribed by subdivision (b) of the same code section. (People v. Martinez (2012)\n208 Cal.App.4th 197, 199.) We therefore agree with the parties that the appropriate\nremedy is to modify the judgments to reflect convictions under Count 13 for the lesser\nincluded offense of assault with a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2).\n(§ 1260; People v. Navarro (2007) 40 Cal.4th 668, 678-679 [an appellate court can\nmodify the judgment to reflect conviction of a lesser included offense if the evidence\nsupports the lesser offense but not the charged crime]; People v. Howard (2002) 100\nCal.App.4th 94, 99 [same].) Appellants shall be resentenced accordingly on remand.\nAttempting to Dissuade a Witness by Force or Threats\n       Rivas was charged as a co-conspirator in Count 4 of the indictment as follows:\n“[C]ommitting the crime of ATTEMPTING TO DISSUADE A WITNESS in violation of\nPenal Code section 136.1(c)(1), a felony, in the County of Fresno, in that on or about\nFebruary 24, 2010, [defendants] did knowingly and maliciously by an express or implied\nthreat of force or violence attempt to prevent and dissuade a witness and victim,\nDarshawn [sic] Walia and Gurmuph Singh[,] from making a report of that victimization\nto any peace officer or law enforcement agency as authorized by law.” (Original\ncapitalization.)\n       Count 4 pertained to the robbery in Clovis. Because victim Darshan Walia was\ndeceased at the time of trial, the prosecution relied on the testimony of Gurmuph Singh to\nprove the elements of the offense. Mr. Singh’s testimony described his encounter with\nfive armed intruders who ransacked his home in search of “gold and cash.” The robbers\n\n                                            41.\n\fwere in the house for approximately 30 minutes, during which time they brought him into\nhis living room, made him lie face down on the floor, and tied up his legs with “electrical\nwires.” Mr. Singh also testified that the men “took off all the receivers” from the\ntelephones in the home. When the prosecutor asked for clarification of this testimony, he\nreplied, “They picked up all the receivers so we can’t talk to anybody.”\n       Section 136.1 addresses multiple forms of witness intimidation.\n“Subdivision (a)(1) proscribes knowingly and maliciously preventing or dissuading any\nwitness or victim from attending or giving testimony at any trial, proceeding, or inquiry\nauthorized by law, and subdivision (a)(2) proscribes attempting to do so.” (People v.\nTorres (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1138.) “Subdivision (b) proscribes three other\nwobblers with the common element of attempting to prevent or dissuade a crime victim\nor witness from doing any of the following: reporting the victimization to anyone in law\nenforcement, including a law enforcement officer, a peace officer, probation, parole, or\ncorrectional officer, a prosecuting agency, or a judge (subd. (b)(1)); causing a complaint,\nindictment, information, probation or parole violation to be prosecuted and assisting in\nthe prosecution (subd. (b)(2)); or seeking or causing the arrest or arresting a person in\nconnection with ‘that victimization’ (subd. (b)(3)). Unlike the subdivision (a) offenses,\nthe subdivision (b) offenses do not expressly include the mental element of knowingly\nand maliciously.” (Ibid.)\n       The provision under which Rivas was found guilty, subdivision (c)(1), provides:\n“Every person doing any of the acts described in subdivision (a) or (b) knowingly and\nmaliciously under any one or more of the following circumstances, is guilty of a felony\npunishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years under any of\nthe following circumstances: … Where the act is accompanied by force or by an express\nor implied threat of force or violence, upon a witness or victim or any third person or the\nproperty of any victim, witness, or any third person.” Rivas argues, and the Attorney\n\n\n\n                                             42.\n\fGeneral concedes, that the evidence is insufficient to establish the element of dissuasion\nby force or threats.\n       We are willing to accept the Attorney General’s position, but are unclear about the\nextent of the concession. Respondent’s brief states, in pertinent part: “Rivas’s conviction\non count 4 must be reversed for insufficient evidence, and his sentence reduced\naccordingly.” This is followed by a citation to People v. Bechler (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th\n373, 378-379, which discusses an appellate court’s ability to modify judgments to reflect\na lesser included offense if such a conviction is supported by the evidence. Whether or\nnot respondent intended to suggest the evidence is sufficient to hold Rivas accountable\nfor committing a lesser included offense of section 136.1, subdivision (c)(1), we have\nindependently reached that conclusion after reviewing the record in the light most\nfavorable to the judgment.\n       The jury could have reasonably inferred that removal of the receivers from\nMr. Singh’s telephones was done to prevent him from reporting his victimization to law\nenforcement for purposes of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1). (See People v. McElroy\n(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 874, 878, 882 [elements of subdivision (b)(1) satisfied by\ndefendant’s unplugging of victim’s home telephone to prevent her from using it].)\nUnlike subdivisions (a) and (c) of the statute, subdivision (b)(1) does not require the\npredicate act to be committed “knowingly and maliciously” or to be accompanied by\nforce or threats. It is enough to show the defendant attempted to “prevent or dissuade\nanother person who has been the victim of a crime or who is witness to a crime from …\n[m]aking any report of that victimization to any peace officer or state or local law\nenforcement officer….” (§ 136.1, subd. (b)(1).)\n       Rivas contends that “[a]t most, the evidence showed the men inside the house\ndisconnected the phones in order to delay any efforts to contact police, not to prevent\nthem from reporting the crime altogether.” He cites no authority for reading such\ntemporal distinctions into the statute, and we are not persuaded by his argument. The\n\n                                            43.\n\fonly remaining question is whether his violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1)\nconstituted a lesser included offense of the crime for which he was convicted.\n       “Two tests have traditionally been applied in determining whether an uncharged\noffense is necessarily included within a charged offense – the statutory or legal\n‘elements’ test and the ‘accusatory pleading’ test. (People v. Sloan (2007) 42 Cal.4th\n110, 117 (Sloan), italics omitted.) The elements test asks whether the statutory elements\nof the greater offense include all of the statutory elements of the lesser offense. (Ibid.)\nPut differently, “‘where an offense cannot be committed without necessarily committing\nanother offense, the latter is a necessarily included offense.’” (People v. Pearson (1986)\n42 Cal.3d 351, 355.) Under the accusatory pleading test, an uncharged offense is\nincluded within the charged offense if the facts alleged in the accusatory pleading include\nall of the elements of the uncharged crime. (Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 117.)\n       Under the elements test, a violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1) is\nnecessarily included within the offenses set forth in section 136.1, subdivision (c).\n(People v. Upsher (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1321.) The accusatory pleadings test\nshows that the factual allegations in Count 4 encompassed every element of subdivision\n(b)(1), and thus provided Rivas with adequate notice of his potential liability for this\nlesser included offense. Therefore, we find it appropriate to modify the judgment to\nreflect a conviction under Count 4 for attempting to prevent a victim or witness from\nreporting a crime in violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1). Rivas is to be\nresentenced accordingly on remand. Since the lesser included offense is a “wobbler,” the\ntrial court will have discretion to treat the conviction as either a felony or a misdemeanor.\n(§ 17, subd. (b); People v. Superior Court (Alvarez) (1997) 14 Cal.4th 968, 974, 977.)\n   VI. Gang Findings\n       A bifurcated jury trial was conducted as to the gang-related allegations in Counts\n9, 11, and 16. Each of those counts involved the substantive offense of robbery\ncommitted within an inhabited dwelling house and in concert with two or more other\n\n                                             44.\n\fpersons (§§ 211, 213, subd. (a)(1)(A)). The gang allegations were made pursuant to\nsection 186.22, subdivision (b), which provides for increased punishment when an\noffense is committed “for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any\ncriminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal\nconduct by gang members.” (Id., subd. (b)(1) and (4).) The jury’s findings ultimately\ndetermined whether appellants received life sentences (Centeno, Leon, and Palofox) or a\nsentence for a term of years (Rivas).8\n       The prosecution argued that appellants knowingly committed the underlying\noffenses in association with members of a criminal street gang, and were therefore liable\nunder section 186.22, subdivision (b) regardless of their personal gang affiliations or lack\nthereof. To support this theory, evidence was presented regarding admissions made by\ncertain individuals during jail classification interviews that followed their arrest for the\nsubject robberies, including those of third party accomplices/co-conspirators Gilbert\n\n\n       8  Most felonies committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association\nwith a criminal street gang are subject to the enhancement of an additional prison term\nranging from two to ten years. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(A)-(C).) However, if the gang-\nrelated crime is a “home invasion robbery,” the defendant faces a sentence of 15 years to\nlife. (Id., subd. (b)(4)(B); People v. Jones (2009) 47 Cal.4th 566, 571 (Jones).) Section\n186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B) is not an enhancement, but rather an “alternate penalty\nprovision,” meaning it sets forth an alternate penalty for the underlying offense if the jury\nfinds the conditions specified in the provision have been satisfied. (Jones, supra, 47\nCal.4th at p. 576.) Standing alone, a home invasion robbery conviction carries a\nmaximum sentence of nine years in prison. (§ 213, subd. (a)(1)(A).) If the offense is\nfound to be gang-related within the meaning of section 186.22, the punishment is life in\nprison with a minimum parole eligibility period of 15 years. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(4)(B).)\n       We note the indictment actually cited to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), which\nis an enhancement provision, and made no reference to subdivision (b)(4)(B). Appellants\ndo not allege prejudice in this regard, and thus impliedly acknowledge that they received\nadequate notice of their potential exposure to a life sentence under the alternate penalty\nprovision. (See § 960; People v. Thomas (1987) 43 Cal.3d 818, 826-827 [failure to cite\nthe correct code section is inconsequential if the accusatory pleading alleges all facts\nnecessary to establish its applicability].)\n\n\n                                              45.\n\fBeltran, Christopher Escobedo, Estevan Landeros, and Christian Rodriguez. Evidence of\nan admission made by Centeno during the jail intake process was introduced over an\nobjection that it was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. Leon, Palofox, and\nRivas each denied having gang ties during their own jail classification interviews, but the\njury learned Palofox subsequently admitted his gang status in conjunction with a request\nto be transferred out of general population housing for safety reasons. The gang\nallegations were found true as to Centeno, Leon, and Palofox, but not true with respect to\nRivas.\n         On appeal, Centeno renews his Miranda objection and summarily joins in\narguments made by Leon. Leon’s briefing challenges all of the prosecution’s jail\nclassification evidence on grounds that its admission contravened Miranda principles and\nresulted in a violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution. In a related argument, Leon contends that the prosecution\nintroduced testimonial hearsay through the opinions of its gang expert in violation of his\nconstitutional right to confront adverse witnesses. Palofox summarily joins in the\npositions taken by Centeno and Leon.\n         During the pendency of this appeal, the California Supreme Court issued its\ndecision in Elizalde, supra, which addresses and resolves the Miranda issue raised by\nCenteno. It is now settled that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is\nimplicated when law enforcement officers ask “routine questions about gang affiliation”\nwhile processing a defendant into jail. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 527.) As will be\nexplained, the admission of evidence concerning Centeno’s jail classification statements\nwas erroneous under Elizalde. The more difficult question is whether the error was\nprejudicial, and the answer depends in part on the admissibility of the statements made by\naccomplices/co-conspirators who were not parties to the case. We conclude appellants\ndo not have standing to assert the constitutional rights of those third parties, nor could\nthey have asserted their own Sixth Amendment confrontation rights as a basis for\n\n                                             46.\n\fexcluding evidence of the third-party admissions. Given the significance of the\naccomplices’ self-incriminating statements in combination with other admissible\nevidence presented at trial, the violation of Centeno’s Miranda rights did not constitute\nreversible error.\nAdditional Background Information\n       Trial of the gang allegations began with a hearing conducted pursuant to Evidence\nCode section 402 in regards to Centeno’s jail classification admissions. The trial court\nhad previously advised defense counsel of its belief that the law was “fairly settled” in\nterms of there being “no grounds for arguing that there’s some kind of Fifth Amendment\nviolation” in the use of such evidence. Each defendant was given the opportunity to\nargue otherwise, but only Centeno chose to do so. Relying on pre-Elizalde case law, the\ntrial court ruled that Centeno’s statements during the jail intake process were admissible.\n       The prosecution’s case-in-chief included testimony by correctional officers from\nthe Fresno County jail. Witness Cynthia Diaz described herself as a “jail classification\nofficer” or “population management officer.” Her duties involved placing inmates in the\nappropriate custodial setting based on their responses to a standardized intake interview.\nThe process required interviewees to answer questions listed on a pre-printed form,\nincluding, “Do you associate with any street/prison gangs? If yes, explain.” All inmates\nwere required to review and sign their completed form.\n       Officer Diaz conducted two classification interviews with Estevan Landeros. She\nobserved and documented the presence of tattoos on his body of the words “South Side”\nand of three dots grouped together in a triangular pattern. Recognizing the tattoos as\nbeing indicative of a connection to the “Sureno” gang, Officer Diaz was skeptical when\nLanderos initially denied being a gang member or associate. During the second\ninterview, she advised him that he needed to answer the gang association question\ntruthfully for his own safety. At trial she explained: “If he denied then I would have to\nput him in general population, [where] we have rival gangs and he would be assaulted.”\n\n                                            47.\n\fThe majority of inmates in general population housing were members of the regional\n“Bulldogs” gang, which viewed the Surenos as a rival group. Landeros eventually\ninformed Officer Diaz that he “associated with the Surenos.”\n        The correctional officer who interviewed Centeno testified that he admitted to\nbeing a “Sureno from Phoenix.” Christian Rodriguez similarly identified himself as a\n“Phoenix Sureno” during his jail classification interview. Christopher Escobedo admitted\nto being a “South Side associate from Phoenix,” and Gilbert Beltran claimed to be a\n“South Sider from Phoenix.” Beltran and Escobedo were noted to have tattoos of the\nletters “SS.” Escobedo reportedly obtained a three-dot tattoo subsequent to his admission\ninto the jail.\n        Detective Andrew Simonson of the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department testified\nas the prosecution’s gang expert. He explained, based on his training and experience,\nthat the Sureno criminal street gang is controlled by a prison gang known as the\n“Mexican Mafia.” Since most members of the Mexican Mafia are “locked down in\nprotective housing units throughout the state and federal system,” they rely on the\nSurenos to act as their “foot soldiers” outside of prison, generating money for the\norganization through criminal activity.\n        The Surenos have a nationwide presence and commonly identify with certain\nwords and symbols. The name itself translates to “southerner,” and terms such as “sur”\n(meaning “south”) “south side” or “south sider” are often used to indicate a Sureno\naffiliation. The number 13 has significance to Surenos because the thirteenth letter of the\nalphabet is “M,” which to them connotes the Mexican Mafia. Gang members will display\nthe number 13 using Roman numerals or a symbol from the Mayan numbering system of\ntwo horizontal lines underneath three dots. According to Detective Simonson, the most\ncommon tattoo used by Surenos to signify their membership is three dots grouped\ntogether in a triangular pattern.\n\n\n\n                                            48.\n\f       Detective Simonson opined that appellants and their accomplices were all Sureno\nmembers or associates. His opinions with respect to the accomplices were primarily\nbased on their admissions during jail classification interviews. The expert stressed that\nhe considered such admissions to be the most reliable form of evidence to determine gang\naffiliation (“For us it’s basically a stand-alone criteria”). As a practical matter, gang\nmembers are motived by “self-preservation” to answer jail classification questions\ntruthfully because “[t]hey don’t want to be placed in housing with rival gang members\nwhere they can be killed [or] assaulted.” Falsely claiming association with a particular\ngang can also be deadly. In Detective Simonson’s experience, the occupants of a\nsegregated Sureno “pod” will assault or kill non-Surenos if such individuals are housed\nwith them.\n       Leon denied having gang ties during his classification interview and was\naccordingly housed in a minimum security location. Nevertheless, Detective Simonson\nbelieved Leon was a Sureno “associate.” The expert had personally participated in the\nexecution of a search warrant at Leon’s residence in Arizona, and had observed\ndistinctive gang graffiti displayed in various locations on the property. He testified to\nseeing the number 13 carved into trees near the trailer in which Leon was living, and, in\nother locations, the three-dot imagery, the words “South Side” and “Hayden Park,” and\nthe letters “SS” and “VHPLS.” The letters VHPLS purportedly stood for “Vario Hayden\nPark Locos,” a Phoenix area subset of the Surenos. Photographs of the graffiti were\nadmitted into evidence.\n       The expert’s opinions about Leon were further based on his review of police\nreports and other information provided to him by members of the Phoenix Police\nDepartment. According to those sources, Leon had previously been seen wearing gang\nclothing and was known to associate with Estevan Landeros. Phoenix police believed\nLanderos and Leon were both part of the Vario Hayden Park Locos.\n\n\n\n                                             49.\n\f       As to Centeno, the expert relied on “jail classifications as well as Phoenix Police\nreports.” These records indicated that Centeno had gang tattoos and belonged to a\nSureno subset known as the “Vario Happy Homes Locos.” He was also known to\nassociate with Palofox and Gilbert Beltran.\n       On direct examination, Detective Simonson opined that Palofox was a Sureno\nmember based upon his review of “the Phoenix Police reports as well as local\nclassification documents.” On cross-examination, Palofox’s attorney elicited testimony\nfrom the expert regarding his client’s denial of gang membership during a classification\ninterview at the Fresno County Jail – information not previously disclosed in front of the\njury. Defense counsel also successfully moved to have Palofox’s signed jail\nclassification questionnaire admitted into evidence. This line of questioning led to the\nrevelation that Palofox had later requested to be transferred from general population\nhousing out of fear for his safety: “Originally he was placed with Bulldogs. He was – he\ntold the CO that the Bulldogs overheard him talking to his family and stated he slipped.\nAnd then he admitted to the classification officers that he was a South Sider and he no\nlonger [felt] comfortable housed with any Bulldogs.”\n       Finally, with respect to Rivas, the expert acknowledged there was no evidence to\nindicate he was a gang member. Detective Simonson believed Rivas had associated with\ngang members through his involvement with the codefendants and other accomplices, but\nconceded there was no evidence Rivas actually knew those individuals were members of\na gang. As stated above, the gang allegations against Rivas were found not to be true.\nThe Elizalde Decision\n       In Elizalde, the California Supreme Court considered “whether routine questions\nabout gang affiliation, posed to [a] defendant while processing him into jail on murder\ncharges, come within Miranda’s well-recognized booking exception.” (Elizalde, supra,\n61 Cal.4th at p. 527.) The key holding of the opinion is as follows: “Gang affiliation\nquestions do not conform to the narrow exception contemplated in [Rhode Island v. Innis\n\n                                              50.\n\f(1980) 446 U.S. 291 (Innis)] and [Pennsylvania v. Muniz (1990) 496 U.S. 582] for basic\nidentifying biographical data necessary for booking or pretrial services. Instead, they\nmust be measured under the general Innis test, which defines as ‘interrogation’ questions\nthe police should know are ‘reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.’”\n(Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 538.) Whether or not a gang-related inquiry by jail\npersonnel requires a Miranda admonition will depend on the nature of the charges the\ninmate is facing.\n       The Elizalde defendant was asked gang affiliation questions by sheriff’s deputies\nwho were aware he had been charged with murder but did not know the offense was\ngang-related. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 529.) Ignorance of the latter circumstance\nwas immaterial because murder is “a crime frequently committed for the benefit of\ncriminal street gangs, and a qualifying offense establishing a ‘“pattern of criminal gang\nactivity”’” for purposes of section 186.22. Therefore, the questions were likely to elicit\nan incriminating response and needed to be prefaced with a Miranda admonition, “even if\nthe deputies’ subjective intention was benign.” (Elizalde, at p. 540.) “While officers\nwere permitted to ask these questions for institutional security purposes, defendant’s un-\nMirandized responses were inadmissible against him during the [prosecution’s] case-in-\nchief.” (Id. at p. 527.)\n       Under Elizalde, Centeno’s objection to the admission of his jail classification\nstatements should have been sustained. The jail classification officer who interviewed\nhim knew of his connection to the other inmates from Arizona, and the record indicates\nthe officer would have also been aware of his charges. As discussed in footnote 8, ante,\nrobbery in concert in violation of section 213, subdivision (a)(1)(A) is subject to\npunishment under the alternate penalty provision in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B).\nThese circumstances made it reasonably likely that the gang affiliation question would\nelicit an incriminating response, and a Miranda admonishment was therefore required.\n\n\n\n                                            51.\n\f       Palofox’s situation does not fit squarely within the parameters of the Elizalde\ndecision. It appears he approached correctional officers on his own accord and\nvolunteered information about his gang status in conjunction with a request for alternate\nhousing arrangements. The record does not demonstrate that his admission was the\nproduct of interrogation. He has made no effort to argue this issue on appeal, and we will\nnot endeavor to make arguments on his behalf. (See People v. Bryant, Smith and\nWheeler (2014) 60 Cal.4th 335, 364 [although joinder of claims is broadly permitted,\n“‘each appellant has the burden of demonstrating error and prejudice’”].) Under current\nlaw, a gang expert’s opinion may be based on hearsay, and when testifying, he or she\nmay describe the material that forms the basis for their opinion. (People v. Gardeley\n(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 618.) We therefore assume Detective Simonson’s testimony in\nregards to Palofox’s admission was permissible.\nDue Process Considerations\n       Leon claims his due process rights were violated by the admission of evidence of\nhis co-conspirators’ jail classification statements. He argues those statements were\ncoerced in that each person faced a Hobson’s choice of providing self-incriminating\ninformation or jeopardizing their personal safety by being housed with rival gang\nmembers. Leon further alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial\nattorney’s failure to make these arguments below.\n       “It is settled that the accused has no standing to object to a violation of another’s\nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.” (People v. Badgett (1995)\n10 Cal.4th 330, 343 (Badgett).) However, a defendant does have limited standing to\nassert that his own due process right to a fair trial has been violated through the\nadmission of improperly obtained statements made by a third party. (Williams, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 452; People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 966 (Jenkins).) This\nrelatively uncommon issue has arisen in the context of a challenge to coerced trial\ntestimony, and in relation to the “fruits” of a third party’s involuntary out-of-court\n\n                                             52.\n\fstatements. (Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 452-454; Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at pp.\n966-967; Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at pp. 342-348; People v. Douglas (1990) 50 Cal.3d\n468, 501-505; People v. Varnum (1967) 66 Cal.2d 808, 811-813.) Leon cites to most of\nthese cases in his briefs, but provides no further authority regarding due process\nchallenges to the type of evidence at issue here.\n       “The violation of a third party’s privilege against self-incrimination may deprive a\ndefendant of his or her due process rights if such action adversely affects the reliability of\ntestimony offered against defendant at trial.” (Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 966.)\n“[W]hen the defendant’s claim is based upon the involuntariness of a third party’s\nstatement, the exclusionary rule applicable to a claimed violation of the privilege against\nself-incrimination does not apply. [Citation.] Rather, the defendant may prevail only by\ndemonstrating fundamental unfairness at trial, normally by establishing that evidence to\nbe produced at trial was made unreliable by coercion.” (Ibid.; see Badgett, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 348 [“Testimony of third parties that is offered at trial should not be\nsubject to exclusion unless the defendant demonstrates that improper coercion has\nimpaired the reliability of the testimony.”].)\n       Respondent argues there is no due process violation under the framework set forth\nin cases such as Jenkins and Badgett because the circumstances in which the statements\nof Leon’s co-conspirators were made, and the independent evidence of their gang\naffiliations, overwhelmingly demonstrate that the admissions were reliable. Leon does\nnot disagree with the reliability argument, but submits that a due process violation should\nbe found because the third-party admissions were procured by “outrageous police\nmisconduct.” We find respondent’s argument to be more persuasive given the authorities\nupon which the parties have relied. The Elizalde decision may inevitably lead to future\nclaims that even Mirandized jail classification admissions are inherently coercive, but we\nneed not resolve that issue in order to dispose of Leon’s current claim. The ineffective\nassistance claim fails pursuant to the foregoing analysis and given the state of the law at\n\n                                             53.\n\fthe time of trial. (See People v. Welch (1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, 237 [“Reviewing courts\nhave traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection\nwould have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence.”].)\nSixth Amendment Considerations\n       Leon alleges a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under Crawford v.\nWashington (2004) 541 U.S. 36 (Crawford). Two categories of evidence are relevant to\nhis claim. He describes the first category as “hearsay evidence from Phoenix police,”\nreferring to the documents and verbal information Detective Simonson obtained from\nArizona law enforcement officers and relied upon in forming his expert opinions. The\nsecond category is comprised of the jail classification admissions of his codefendants and\nthird-party accomplices.\n       “The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution,\nmade applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that ‘[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him.’ The right of confrontation includes the right of cross-\nexamination.” (People v. Fletcher (1996) 13 Cal.4th 451, 455.) In Crawford, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that the confrontation clause bars the admission of out-of-\ncourt testimonial hearsay statements except when “the declarant is unavailable …” and\nthe defendant “had a prior opportunity to cross-examine” the declarant. (Crawford,\nsupra, 541 U.S. at p. 59.)\n       The issue of whether a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is\nviolated by a gang expert’s reliance on testimonial hearsay is currently pending before\nthe California Supreme Court. (People v. Sanchez, review granted May 14, 2014,\nS216681; People v. Archuleta, review granted June 11, 2014, S218640 [briefing deferred\npending consideration and disposition of Sanchez]; People v. Eberhart, review granted\nNovember 24, 2015, S229864 [same].) We decline to speculate as to how the issue will\nbe decided, and conclude the verdict in this case would have been the same even without\n\n                                             54.\n\fDetective Simonson’s testimony regarding the contents of Phoenix police reports and his\nconversations with out-of-state law enforcement officers. (See further discussion, infra.)\nThe outcome would likely have been different if appellants’ Sixth Amendment rights\nwere implicated by evidence of their accomplices’ jail classification admissions, but for\nthe reasons that follow we conclude those admissions were not “testimonial” for purposes\nof Crawford.\n       In Elizalde, our Supreme Court determined that jail classification interviews are a\nform of custodial interrogation for purposes of the Fifth Amendment insofar as the\nquestioning is likely to elicit an incriminating response. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at\np. 531, 538-539.) However, while responses to such interrogation may be considered\n“testimonial” in a Fifth Amendment context, the same is not necessarily true for purposes\nof the Sixth Amendment. (Id. at p. 533, fn. 7.) The Elizalde opinion contains a footnote\non this point that states, in pertinent part: “This case in no way implicates the court’s\nCrawford jurisprudence.” (Ibid.)\n       The Crawford opinion does not define the term “testimonial,” but says it “applies\nat a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a\nformer trial; and to police interrogations.” (Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 68.) As\noriginally decided, Crawford left no room for debate over the last category: “Statements\ntaken by police officers in the course of interrogations are [] testimonial under even a\nnarrow standard.” (Id. at p. 52.) The high court revised its position in Davis v.\nWashington (2006) 547 U.S. 813 (Davis) to make an exception for emergency situations.\nThe Davis case instructs that “[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course\nof police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary\npurpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\nThey are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such\nongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or\nprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” (Davis, supra, 547\n\n                                             55.\n\fU.S. at p. 822.) This aspect of the opinion has come to be known as the “primary\npurpose” test. (Ohio v. Clark (2015) ___ U.S. ___ [135 S.Ct. 2173, 2179] (Clark).)\n       Since Davis, the United States Supreme Court has adopted the view that “not all\nthose questioned by the police are witnesses” for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and\nnot all “‘interrogations by law enforcement officers’ [citation], are subject to the\nConfrontation Clause.’” (Michigan v. Bryant (2011) 562 U.S. 344, 355 (Bryant), quoting\nCrawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 53.) Hearsay evidence must now satisfy the primary\npurpose test in order to be considered testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\nright to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. (Clark, supra, __ U.S. at p. __\n[135 S.Ct. at p. 2180]; People v. Chism (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1266, 1288-1289 (Chism).) In\nits current formulation, the test asks whether the statement at issue was “procured with a\nprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.” (Bryant,\nsupra, 562 U.S. at p. 358.) The California Supreme Court has described the test in\nsubstantially similar terms: “First, to be testimonial the statement must be made with\nsome degree of formality or solemnity. Second, the statement is testimonial only if its\nprimary purpose pertains in some fashion to a criminal prosecution.” (People v. Dungo\n(2012) 55 Cal.4th 608, 619.)\n       The primary purpose test is essentially a totality of the circumstances analysis.\n“[T]he relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved\nin a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have\nhad, as ascertained from the individuals’ statements and actions and the circumstances in\nwhich the encounter occurred.” (Bryant, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 360.) “In the end, the\nquestion is whether, in light of all the circumstances, viewed objectively, the ‘primary\npurpose’ of the conversation was to ‘creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for trial\ntestimony.’” (Clark, supra, __ U.S. at p. __ [135 S.Ct. at p. 2180].) “‘Where no such\nprimary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal\nrules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.’” (Ibid.)\n\n                                             56.\n\f       Here, the statements in dispute were made with a sufficient degree of formality.\nHowever, we cannot conclude the primary purpose of those statements – from the\nperspective of either the person asking the questions or the person answering them – was\nto create an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony or to otherwise contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution. Nothing suggests that Leon’s codefendants and\nthird-party accomplices disclosed gang membership or affiliation for the purpose of\nmaking a confession against themselves or an accusation against someone else.\nLikewise, based on all of the available evidence, including testimony by the correctional\nofficers who appeared at trial, we are convinced the primary purpose for the gang\naffiliation questions was to further institutional security objectives, i.e., to ensure the\nsafety of inmates and jail personnel. The answers to those questions also had evidentiary\nvalue from a prosecutorial standpoint, but the objective primary purpose “reasonable\nparticipants would have had” in this context was not the creation of an out-of-court\nsubstitute for trial testimony. (Bryant, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 360.) Therefore, appellants\ndid not have a Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine each other or their accomplices\nabout the jail classification admissions.\nPrejudice\n       The erroneous admission of a jail classification statement obtained in violation of\nMiranda is reviewed for prejudice under the standard articulated in Chapman v.\nCalifornia (1967) 386 U.S. 18. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 542.) The People must\nshow, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the jury’s verdict.\n(Ibid.) “‘To say that an error did not contribute to the ensuing verdict is … to find that\nerror unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in\nquestion, as revealed in the record.’ [Citation.] Thus, the focus is what the jury actually\ndecided and whether the error might have tainted its decision.” (People v. Neal (2003) 31\nCal.4th 63, 86.) The error in Elizalde was found to be harmless because the defendant’s\ngang connections were established through independent evidence.\n\n                                              57.\n\f       Focusing on what the jury actually decided in this case, we cannot ignore its\nfindings as to Rivas. Both Leon and Rivas denied having gang ties during their jail\nclassification interviews, but only Rivas was exonerated. Rivas stood apart from his co-\nconspirators as the only member of the conspiracy from California. The other men\nresided in or around Phoenix, Arizona. Rivas’s only apparent connection to the group\nwas that he had dated Estevan Landeros’s sister during the relevant time period. When\nRivas took the stand in the first phase of trial, he denied having any involvement in the\nrobberies and claimed to be barely acquainted with Landeros.\n       A trier of fact can rationally infer a crime was committed “in association” with a\ncriminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b) if the\ndefendant committed the offense in concert with gang members. (People v. Morales\n(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1198.) “There is no further requirement that the defendant\nact with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist a gang; the statute requires only\nthe specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by gang members.”\n(People v. Albillar (2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 67, italics omitted.) Rivas was convicted of\nparticipating in all five robberies, and there was overwhelming evidence that the crimes\nwere committed in association with gang members, yet the jury found the section 186.22\nsubdivision (b) allegations not true. Assuming jurors followed the instructions they were\ngiven, the only logical explanation for this outcome is that they believed Rivas did not\nactually know his accomplices were members of a gang. In assessing the potential for\nprejudice in the admission of Centeno’s jail classification statements, we must consider\nwhether the absence of such evidence could have raised similar doubts as to Leon,\nCenteno, and/or Palofox.\n       Only Leon and Rivas were convicted on Count 9, i.e., the robbery which took\nplace in Kerman on March 15, 2010. Because Centeno was not accused of participating\nin this offense, it stands to reason that his jail classification statements did not impact the\njury’s findings with respect to Leon on that count. Since the jury impliedly found Rivas\n\n                                              58.\n\fwas neither a gang member nor gang associate, it would appear Leon’s culpability under\nsection 186.22 was based on his association with the third-party accomplices, most likely\nEstevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez. Numerous victims had identified Landeros\nand Rodriguez to police and/or during their trial testimony, and both men were alleged to\nhave participated in all five robberies.\n       Cell phone evidence showed Leon was in contact with Landeros during the course\nof the conspiracy. Eyewitness testimony also placed Leon and Landeros together on\nvarious dates. Their connection to one another was sufficiently established even without\nthe information contained in the Phoenix police reports, which certainly reinforced the\nother evidence of Leon’s gang ties. Unlike with Rivas, Leon’s familiarity with the\nSurenos could be inferred from the gang graffiti displayed outside of his residence. The\ngraffiti evidence was based on Detective Simonson’s personal observations rather than\nhearsay, and the corresponding photographs were admitted at trial. In summary, the\nrecord demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the gang finding for Leon on Count 9\nwould have been the same with or without evidence of Centeno’s jail classification\nadmission.\n       Counts 11 and 16 respectively pertained to the robberies in Atwater and Selma on\nMarch 16, 2010. Since each appellant was convicted of these crimes, Palofox’s\nadmission of gang membership effectively forecloses any claims of prejudice by Leon\nand Centeno. As to them, the section 186.22 findings were further substantiated by the\nadmissions of their co-conspirators, most of whom were further shown to be Sureno\nmembers through evidence of their gang tattoos. Cell phone records indicated that\nCenteno had calls on March 16, 2010 to or from phones associated with Gilbert Beltran,\nChristopher Escobedo, and Christian Rodriguez. His phone was in regular contact with a\nnumber associated with Christian Rodriguez during February and March of that year.\nThus, even without evidence of his jail classification admission, it was firmly established\n\n\n\n                                            59.\n\fthat Centeno committed Counts 11 and 16 in association with gang members and with the\nintent to further or assist in the conduct of gang members.\n       Palofox’s gang findings were established through his own admissions and by\nevidence of co-defendant Leon’s gang associations. The victim of the Count 11 robbery\nhad also identified Estevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez as being among the\nperpetrators who entered his home, thus removing any doubt about the gang-related\nnature of that offense. The Count 16 findings were further established by evidence of\nGilbert Beltran’s involvement. Beltran pawned a ring that was stolen during this robbery\nafter the group returned to Arizona. Palofox was reportedly living with Beltran at the\ntime of his arrest, and the jury heard recordings of a discussion between Palofox and\nBeltran in which both incriminated themselves. For all of these reasons, it is evident\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the jury’s verdict was not tainted by the erroneous\nadmission of Centeno’s jail classification statements.\nSentencing\n   A. Consecutive Sentences for Gang-Related Home Invasion Robberies\n       Centeno, Leon, and Palofox received consecutive sentences of 15 years to life for\ntheir gang-related robbery convictions pursuant to the trial court’s conclusion that such\npunishment was mandatory under the holding of People v. Felix (2000) 22 Cal.4th 651\n(Felix). As a result, Leon’s convictions on Counts 9, 11, and 16 resulted in an aggregate\nterm of 45 years to life in prison. Centeno and Palofox each received sentences of 30\nyears to life for their convictions on Counts 11 and 16. On appeal, Centeno and Palofox\nargue the trial court misconstrued the Felix decision and acted under a mistaken belief\nthat it had no discretion to impose concurrent sentences for any of the robbery\nconvictions. Leon summarily joins in this claim.\n       The Attorney General submits that the issue is forfeited as a result of appellants’\nfailure to object at the time of sentencing. However, she impliedly concedes the merits of\nappellants’ argument by urging us to find, to the extent the claim is reviewable, that “the\n\n                                            60.\n\ftrial court fully understood its discretionary power” and “properly exercised its discretion\nto select consecutive sentences.” We conclude appellants have carried their burden of\nestablishing error.\n       Regarding forfeiture, the error complained of may fall within a narrow class of\nsentencing issues that are reviewable in the absence of a timely objection. “‘Failure to\nexercise a discretion conferred and compelled by law constitutes a denial of a fair hearing\nand a deprivation of fundamental procedural rights, and thus requires reversal.\n[Citations.]’ [Citation] Where, as here, a sentence choice is based on an erroneous\nunderstanding of the law, the matter must be remanded for an informed determination.”\n(People v. Downey (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 899, 912.) In any event, we would exercise\nour discretion to resolve the claim in the interests of fairness and judicial economy, since\nthe matter is already being remanded for other sentencing matters, and to forestall\nunnecessary ineffective assistance of counsel claims. (See People v. Williams (1998)\n17 Cal.4th 148, 161, fn. 6; People v. Lewis (1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 282.)\n1. Background\n       At Leon’s sentencing hearing, defense counsel made statements regarding the\nanticipated length of his client’s sentence given the section 186.22, subdivision (b)\nfindings. Following a response by the prosecutor, the trial court said: “People [v.] Felix,\n22 Cal.4th 651 in 2000. California Supreme Court directly concluded that indeterminate\nterms of this nature must be served fully consecutive to each other… We all fully\nunderstand it whether we agree with it or not. When I say ‘we,’ I mean the defense, not\nnecessarily the court.” Later, during the pronouncement of sentence, the court stated:\n“I’m ordering you committed to the Department of Corrections on count – each of these\ncounts Nine, Eleven, and Sixteen as required by law to the term of 15 years to life. Each\nof those 15 year-to-life terms to run consecutive to each other as pursuant to the case\nauthority that I just referenced here on the record.”\n\n\n\n                                             61.\n\f       While sentencing Centeno, the trial court indicated that it would have been\ninclined to grant him leniency if it had discretion to do so. The relevant statements were\nas follows:\n\n       “The issue, of course, is what sentence the court should impose. And it seems to\n       me I would agree with the prosecution that in light of everything that I’ve read\n       here, that the court really does not have authority to do otherwise but to impose the\n       sentences with respect to Counts Eleven and Sixteen. But I want to say, in\n       fairness to Mr. Centeno here, and to some future court evaluating this, that if the\n       court believed and understood that it did have the authority to exercise discretion, I\n       might. I might have done that with respect to Mr. Centeno, primarily because of\n       his age and his involvement with a lot of other adults who certainly should have\n       known better.\n\n       And so, you know, I think I want to make – leave that door open here, because I\n       don’t know what the Appellate Court might do in the future on this subject. But\n       this is a situation where, given his limited involvement in this matter and his age\n       as a minor – that’s the most important thing in this court’s view, being a minor at\n       the time of the commission of these crimes – that the court might have exercised\n       its discretion to do other than impose life terms on this case. But in the court’s\n       view, for the reasons that counsel here from the People have a cited authority\n       which is primarily the case of [[People v. Jones, supra, 47 Cal.4th 566] [the]\n       California Supreme Court has made it clear that sentencing for the crime of\n       robbery in concert, you know, in a home invasion robbery scenario for gang\n       purpose, which is what the jury found to be true here, that that’s not an\n       enhancement. And in this court’s view, therefore, is not subject to relief under\n       [section] 186.22(g) that the defense has asked the court to make – grant a motion\n       to strike. This is, in fact, an alternate sentence for this crime. And the court has\n       no authority but to impose that alternate sentence.\n\n       And under the cases that I think I’ve cited earlier, and I’ll make reference to now,\n       which is People [v.] Felix, that’s 22 Cal.4th 651, F-E-L-I-X, that’s a 2000 decision\n       of the California Supreme Court, Mr. Lindahl. 22 Cal.4th 651. Essentially, what\n       that says is where there is separate home invasion robberies they are required to be\n       served fully consecutive – mandatory full consecutive terms…[T]he mandatory\n       sentence, the only sentence this court can impose is 30 years to life.”\n       The trial court referenced Felix yet again during the pronouncement of sentence\nfor Palofox: “…I do agree with your attorney, however, that in light of your personal\ninvolvement that there is no good reason in this court’s view to impose any consecutive\n\n\n\n                                            62.\n\fsentencing on the other counts which are, essentially, derivative. Therefore, under\nPeople [v.] Felix which I’ve cited earlier and in light of the jury’s findings in this matter,\nI am ordering you with respect to Counts Eleven and [Sixteen] to be committed to the\nDepartment of Corrections for the term of 15 years to life in each of those counts.”\n2. Analysis\n       Contrary to the statements of the trial court, the Felix case does not involve\nalternate penalty provisions, nor does it reference home invasion robberies or section\n186.22. The opinion addresses how enhancements are applied to indeterminate\nsentences. (Felix, supra, 22 Cal.4th at pp. 654-659.) A term of imprisonment for life or\na specified number of years to life is an indeterminate sentence for purposes of\nCalifornia’s statutory sentencing scheme (§ 1170, et seq.). (Felix, supra, 22 Cal.4th at\npp. 657-659.) The Felix opinion merely holds that if a trial court elects to impose\nconsecutive sentences for two or more offenses that require indeterminate life terms, any\nenhancements attached thereto must be imposed for the full term of the enhancement,\nrather than one-third of the term as would ordinarily be done under the determinate\nsentencing laws. (Id. at p. 655-656.)\n       Under section 669, a trial court has discretion to determine whether to impose\nsentences consecutively or concurrently. The existence of such discretion is explicitly\nrecognized in the Felix opinion. (Felix, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 655 [“Whenever a person\nis convicted of two or more crimes, the court must impose either concurrent or\nconsecutive sentences. (§ 669.)”].) The Legislature may remove this discretion for\ncertain crimes, but exceptions are typically made clear in the statutory language of the\noffense. (See, e.g., § 667.6, subd. (d) [sex crimes committed under specified\ncircumstances]; § 4501.5 [battery committed by a prisoner against a non-prisoner].)\nUnless otherwise prohibited by statute, sentences for crimes that carry indeterminate life\nterms may be imposed concurrently. “That the court’s authority to impose either\nconcurrent or consecutive sentences includes life sentences is made clear by further\n\n                                              63.\n\flanguage in section 669, which provides: ‘Life sentences, whether with or without the\npossibility of parole, may be imposed to run consecutively with one another, with any\nterm imposed for applicable enhancements, or with any other term of imprisonment for a\nfelony conviction.’” (In re Maes (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1099.)\n       The trial court seems to have conflated two different provisions of section 186.22.\nSubdivision (b)(1) of the statute provides: “Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5),\nany person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of,\nor in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote,\nfurther, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that\nfelony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or\nattempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished [in accordance with\nsubdivision (b)(1)(A), (B) or (C)].” (Italics added.) In contrast, subdivision (b)(4)\nprovides, in pertinent part: “Any person who is convicted of a felony enumerated in this\nparagraph committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any\ncriminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal\nconduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, be sentenced to an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate\nsentence calculated as the greater of … (B) Imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years,\nif the felony is a home invasion robbery, in violation of subparagraph (A) of paragraph\n(1) of subdivision (a) of Section 213…”\n       As previously discussed, section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) is an enhancement\nprovision, while subdivision (b)(4) of the statute is an alternate penalty provision. (Jones,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 576; People v. Briceno (2004) 34 Cal.4th 451, 460, fn. 7.) The\nlatter does not expressly require consecutive sentencing. Trial courts have discretion\nunder section 669 to impose concurrent sentences for multiple convictions of crimes\nsubject to the alternate penalty of 15 years to life under section 186.22, subdivision\n(b)(4)(B), and Felix does not hold otherwise.\n\n                                             64.\n\f       Relief from a trial court’s misunderstanding of its sentencing discretion is\navailable on direct appeal when such misapprehension is affirmatively demonstrated by\nthe record. (See People v. Meloney (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1145, 1151; People v. Fuhrman\n(1997) 16 Cal.4th 930, 945.) Here, the trial court’s repeated citation to Felix, combined\nwith statements regarding its purported lack of discretion to impose anything other than\nconsecutive sentences for the gang-related home invasion robberies, is most reasonably\ninterpreted as confusion over the scope of its sentencing authority. Since the record does\nnot conclusively show whether the trial court would have exercised its discretion to\nimpose concurrent terms on the robbery convictions if it had known that it had such\ndiscretion, appellants are entitled to relief. (People v. Gamble (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th\n891, 901.) The appropriate remedy is a limited remand to give the trial court an\nopportunity to exercise its discretion under section 669 as to Counts 9, 11, and 16. (Ibid;\naccord, People v. Belmontes (1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 348, fn. 8; People v. Brown (2007)\n147 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1228 [“Generally, when the record shows that the trial court\nproceeded with sentencing on the erroneous assumption it lacked discretion, remand is\nnecessary so that the trial court may have the opportunity to exercise its sentencing\ndiscretion at a new sentencing hearing.”].) On remand, the trial court shall exercise its\ndiscretion to run the sentences for these counts consecutively or concurrently, and state\nthe reasons for its decision.9 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.406(b)(5).)\n\n\n\n\n       9 The transcript excerpts quoted above also reflect the trial court’s consideration of\na separate issue concerning whether it had discretion to strike the gang findings to\ncircumvent the alternate penalty requirements of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4).\nSimilar questions are currently pending before the California Supreme Court. (People v.\nVenegas, review granted Dec. 10, 2014, S221923; People v. Fuentes, review granted\nAug. 13, 2014, S219109.) We express no opinion on the issue, as it is not properly\nbefore us in this appeal. Remand on Counts 9, 11, and 16 shall be solely limited to the\ncourt’s discretion to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences.\n\n\n                                             65.\n\f   B. Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n       Centeno contends that the indeterminate sentence of 30 years to life in prison is a\n“de facto” sentence of life without parole, which, given that he was a 17-year-old juvenile\nat the time of the offenses, violates the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual\npunishment. The claim is effectively mooted by our remand for further proceedings on\nthe counts upon which his sentence is based. His argument is also meritless.\n       A prison term falling within the Legislature’s sentencing guidelines is considered\ncruel and unusual punishment in only the rarest of circumstances. (People v. Martinez\n(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 489, 494.) In People v. Caballero (2012) 55 Cal.4th 262\n(Caballero), our Supreme Court held that “sentencing a juvenile offender for a\nnonhomicide offense to a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the\njuvenile offender’s natural life expectancy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.” (Id. at p. 268.) The Caballero defendant was\nsentenced to 110 years to life for a gang-related attempted murder offense committed\nwhen he was 16 years old. (Id. at p. 265.) The length of the sentence was characterized\nas a de facto term of life without the possibility of parole. (Id. at p. 269, fn. 5.)\n       The trial court below observed that Centeno’s sentence of 30 years to life would\nmake him eligible for parole by the time he is 49 years old, “which is clearly not outside\nof any natural life expectancy he might have.” Centeno has not refuted this finding on\nappeal. Furthermore, the enactment of section 3051 ensures he will be eligible for release\non parole during his 20th year of incarceration. (§ 3051, subd. (b)(2).) We thus reject his\ncruel and unusual punishment claim.\n   C. Section 654 Issues\n       Appellants raise challenges under section 654 to the trial court’s imposition of\ncertain concurrent and consecutive sentences which they argue should have been stayed.\nPalofox and Rivas allege error in relation to Counts 13 and 14 with respect to the crimes\nof assault with a firearm and making criminal threats. Only Rivas was sentenced to\n\n                                              66.\n\fconsecutive terms for these offenses. Palofox and Rivas further complain of concurrent\nsentences imposed for their convictions of vehicle theft in Counts 8 (Rivas only), 15, and\n18. Centeno and Leon summarily join in these arguments to the extent they are relevant\nto their own sentences.\nApplicable Law\n       Section 654 prohibits multiple punishment for crimes arising out of a single act or\nindivisible course of conduct. (Id., subd, (a); People v. Hester (2000) 22 Cal.4th 290,\n294.) The defendant’s intent and objective determines whether two crimes are part of an\nindivisible course of conduct. (People v. Harrison (1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 335.) “When a\ntrial court sentences a defendant to separate terms without making an express finding the\ndefendant entertained separate objectives, the trial court is deemed to have made an\nimplied finding each offense had a separate objective.” (People v. Islas (2012) 210\nCal.App.4th 116, 129.) Such findings are upheld on appeal if supported by substantial\nevidence. (Ibid.)\n       In the absence of separate and distinct objectives, it is error to impose concurrent\nsentences instead of staying the execution of sentence for those convictions to which\nsection 654 applies. Errors of this nature are reviewable on appeal regardless of whether\na timely objection was made at the time of sentencing. (People v. Brents (2012)\n53 Cal.4th 599, 618.) “Accordingly, although there appears to be little practical\ndifference between imposing concurrent sentences, as the trial court did, and staying\nsentence on two of the convictions,” we must consider the merits of appellants’\narguments. (People v. Jones (2012) 54 Cal.4th 350, 353.)\nCriminal Threats and Aggravated Assault\n       Counts 13 and 14 pertained to the incident involving victim Fernando Guzman.\nOur modification of the judgment to reflect convictions under Count 13 of assault with a\nfirearm (§ 245, subd. (a)) does not alter the section 654 analysis. Appellants were\nconvicted under Count 14 of making criminal threats in violation of section 422. Rivas\n\n                                            67.\n\fand Palofox submit that threatening Mr. Guzman and assaulting him with a firearm\ncomprised a single act done pursuant to the objective of making him comply with their\ndemands for money. The trial court was not persuaded by this argument, nor are we.\n       Mr. Guzman was holding his infant daughter when he was accosted by\napproximately eight gunmen, each of whom pointed their weapons at him and his child.\nWhen he told the men there was no money in the house, one of them grabbed the baby\nout of his hands and another hit him in the back of the head with what he believed was a\ngun. After he fell to the ground, they punched and kicked him for an extended period of\ntime. He was then moved to another room, tied up, and left there with his daughter and\none of the robbers while the rest of the people ransacked his house.\n       Later, as he was lying tied up on the ground, the robbers reconvened and he heard\none of them say, “Let’s smoke this guy.” Fearing for his life, Mr. Guzman requested that\nhis daughter be taken into another room so she would not see him get shot. They ignored\nhis request, and one of them pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger. When the gun\ndid not fire, the robbers began to laugh.\n       We find the Fourth District’s conclusions in People v. Nguyen (1988)\n204 Cal.App.3d 181 particularly relevant here. “[A]t some point the means to achieve an\nobjective may become so extreme they can no longer be termed ‘incidental’ and must be\nconsidered to express a different and more sinister goal than mere successful commission\nof the original crime. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . [S]ection [654] cannot, and should not, be\nstretched to cover gratuitous violence or other criminal acts far beyond those reasonably\nnecessary to accomplish the original offense.” (Id. at p. 191.) The evidence supporting\nCounts 13 and 14 permits the finding of separate intents and objectives despite the related\ncourse of conduct. We therefore reject all section 654 arguments as to those offenses.\nRobbery and Vehicle Theft\n       In each of the robberies that occurred in Counts 5, 11, and 16, a vehicle was stolen\nfrom the victims’ home. The vehicles were later found abandoned at nearby locations.\n\n                                                68.\n\fAppellants were convicted of vehicle theft within the meaning of Vehicle Code section\n10851, subdivision (a) on Counts 8 (Rivas only), 15, and 18. None of the parties objected\nto the imposition of concurrent sentences on these counts, and the trial court’s reasons for\nnot applying section 654 do not appear in the record.\n       Robbery is a continuing offense that begins at the time property is taken from\nanother by force or fear and ends when the robber reaches a place of temporary safety.\n(People v. Anderson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 989, 994.) In People v. Bauer (1969) 1 Cal.3d\n368 (Bauer), two robbers entered a home, threatened the occupants with weapons, tied\nthem up, stole various items, and drove off in an automobile which belonged to one of the\nvictims. (Id. at p. 372.) The California Supreme Court held that section 654 precluded\nseparate punishment for the vehicle theft conviction under the circumstances of the case.\nThe decision was based on the general principle that “where a defendant robs his victim\nin one continuous transaction of several items of property, punishment for robbery on the\nbasis of the taking of one of the items and other crimes on the basis of the taking of the\nother items is not permissible.” (Id. at p. 377.)\n       After reviewing the record, we are unable to distinguish this case from Bauer in\nany material respect. Appellants are therefore entitled to have their sentences on Counts\n8, 15, and 18 stayed. We remand for resentencing on these counts with instructions that\nthe trial court comply with section 654.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgments are affirmed in part and reversed in part. As to Rivas, the\njudgment is modified to reflect a conviction under Count 4 of the lesser included offense\nof attempting to prevent a victim or witness from reporting a crime in violation of section\n136.1, subdivision (b)(1). As to Centeno, Leon, Palofox, and Rivas, the judgments are\nmodified to reflect convictions under Count 13 of the lesser included offense of assault\nwith a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2). Subject to these\n\n\n\n                                             69.\n\fmodifications, all convictions and all findings as Centeno, Leon, Palofox, and Rivas are\naffirmed.\n       As to Centeno, the sentences imposed for Counts 11, 13, 15, 16, and 18 are\nreversed subject to the conditions set forth herein. Centeno shall be resentenced for these\ncounts on remand in a manner consistent with this opinion. As to Leon, the sentences\nimposed for Counts 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, and 18 are reversed subject to the conditions set\nforth herein. Leon shall be resentenced for these counts on remand in a manner\nconsistent with this opinion. As to Palofox, the sentences imposed for Counts 11, 13, 15,\n16, and 18 are reversed subject to the conditions set forth herein. Palofox shall be\nresentenced for these counts on remand in a manner consistent with this opinion. As to\nRivas, the sentences imposed for Counts 4, 8, 13, 15, and 18 are reversed subject to the\nconditions set forth herein. Rivas shall be resentenced for these counts on remand in a\nmanner consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, the judgments are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                                _____________________\n                                                                            GOMES, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\nHILL, P.J.\n\n\n _____________________\nDETJEN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            70.\n\f",

Their trials were severed from those of alleged co-conspirators with whom\nthey were indicted in connection with these events. Centeno, Leon, and Palofox each\nreceived life sentences for their role in the conspiracy based on a jury’s findings that the\nrobberies were gang-related.

Our\n\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fpublished discussion further holds that trial courts have discretion under Penal Code1\nsection 669 to impose concurrent sentences for gang-related offenses punishable under\nthe alternate penalty provisions of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4).\n                               STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n       The underlying events occurred in February and March of 2010 when a group of\npeople from Arizona, working in conjunction with an individual who lived in California,\ncarried out a series of home invasion robberies in the cities of Atwater, Clovis, Kerman,\nand Selma. The crimes were carefully coordinated, sometimes involving upwards of 10\nperpetrators, and followed the same general pattern. The men would split up into two\ngroups of lookouts and intruders, with the former stationing themselves in parked cars at\nstrategically selected locations and maintaining communication with the intruders over\ncell phones and “walkie-talkies.” The intruders, meanwhile, would enter homes and\nforce the occupants inside to surrender cash, gold, and other items of value. Armed with\nguns, they threatened to kill their victims and used violence to extract information about\nthe location of money and valuables. The victims were sometimes tied up with electrical\ncords and other makeshift restraints. In three of the five incidents, an automobile was\nstolen during the course of the robbery.\n       A joint investigatory effort by law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona\nled to the arrest and prosecution of nine suspects. On March 22, 2011, a Fresno County\ngrand jury returned an 18-count indictment against appellants and their accomplices,\nGilbert Beltran, Christopher Escobedo, Estevan Landeros, Christian Rodriguez, and Eric\nRodriguez. Count 1 of the indictment charged all parties with criminal conspiracy in\nviolation of section 182, subdivision (a)(1). Leon and Rivas, along with co-conspirators\nEstevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez, were each charged in Counts 2 through 18 for\ntheir respective roles in the five robberies. All parties, including Centeno and Palofox,\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                               4.\n\fwere charged in Counts 11 through 18 for their participation in the last two of those\nrobberies. Centeno, who was 17 years old at the time of the offenses, was charged as an\nadult pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (d)(1).\n       Appellants were tried before a Fresno County jury in May and June 2012. A\nbifurcated trial was conducted on gang allegations that were made pursuant to section\n186.22, subdivision (b). Trial evidence relevant to the claims on appeal is described\nwithin the body of our Discussion.\n       The first two robberies occurred on February 24, 2010 in Clovis and Atwater. For\nhis part in the Clovis robbery, Rivas was convicted of robbery in concert (§§ 211, 213,\nsubd. (a)(1)(A); Count 2), false imprisonment by violence (§§ 236, 237; Count 3), and\nusing threats or violence to prevent or dissuade a victim from reporting a crime (§ 136.1,\nsubd. (c)(1); Count 4). In relation to the Atwater robbery, Rivas was convicted of\nrobbery in concert (Count 5), assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury (§ 245,\nsubd. (a)(1); Count 6), false imprisonment by violence (Count 7), and vehicle theft (Veh.\nCode, § 10851, subd. (a); Count 8). He was also found guilty of conspiracy under\nCount 1. Leon was convicted of conspiracy as well, but was acquitted on Counts 2\nthrough 8.\n       The third robbery took place in Kerman on March 15, 2010. For this incident,\nLeon and Rivas were convicted of robbery in concert (Count 9) and false imprisonment\nby violence (Count 10). As to Leon, the robbery was found to be gang-related within the\nmeaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b).\n       The fourth and fifth robberies occurred on March 16, 2010 in Atwater and Selma.\nFor the (second) Atwater robbery, all appellants were convicted of robbery in concert\n(Count 11), false imprisonment by violence (Count 12), assault with a semiautomatic\nfirearm (§ 245, subd. (b); Count 13), making criminal threats (§ 422; Count 14), and\nvehicle theft (Count 15). In regards to the Selma robbery, appellants were convicted of\nrobbery in concert (Count 16), false imprisonment (Count 17), and vehicle theft\n\n                                              5.\n\f(Count 18). As to Centeno, Leon, and Palofox, the robberies were found to be gang-\nrelated. Enhancement allegations for personal use of a firearm within the meaning of\nsection 12022.5, subdivision (a) were found true as to Leon on Counts 11 and 12.\n       Leon was sentenced to an aggregate term of 48 years to life in prison. For robbery\nin concert under Counts 9, 11, and 16, he received consecutive terms of 15 years to life\nbased on the alternate penalty set forth in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B). A\nconsecutive three-year term was imposed for the gun enhancement attached to Count 11.\nConcurrent terms were imposed for Counts 14, 15, and 18, with all other sentences\nstayed.\n       Centeno and Palofox received sentences of 30 years to life in prison based on the\ngang-related robbery convictions on Counts 11 and 16. Concurrent terms were imposed\nfor Counts 13, 14, 15, and 18. All other sentences were stayed.\n       Rivas was sentenced to a total of 22 years in prison as follows: The upper term of\n9 years under Count 2 for robbery in concert, plus consecutive two-year terms (one-third\nof the middle term) for each robbery in concert conviction under Counts 5, 9, 11 and 16,\nplus a consecutive three-year term for Count 4, and a consecutive two-year term for\nCount 13. Concurrent terms were imposed as to Counts 8, 14, 15, and 18. Stayed\nsentences were imposed for all remaining counts.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n   I. Palofox’s Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim\n       Palofox contends that one or more attorneys who represented him below failed to\nconvey material information about a plea offer. If true, such failures might entitle him to\nrelief on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record, however, does not\nsubstantiate his allegations of deficient performance and prejudice. We therefore reject\nhis claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\fBackground\n        Palofox was represented at the earliest hearings in the case by Nancy Wong, who\nthen worked as a deputy public defender in Fresno County. Ms. Wong made at least four\ncourt appearances on behalf of Palofox during the months of June, September, and\nDecember 2010. While stating her appearance on September 14, 2010, Ms. Wong noted\nthat she was “standing in for Roberto Dulce,” referring to another deputy public defender\nin her office. Mr. Dulce had at that point made two prior court appearances with Palofox\nduring the month of August, and later represented him at a hearing held on October 12,\n2010.\n        On December 3, 2010, Ms. Wong attended a court hearing with Palofox where the\ntopic of plea bargains arose during a discussion about scheduling. The reporter’s\ntranscript reflects that an unidentified defense attorney said, “My only concern is that we\njust got handed written offers in court today, and it says that the offer will remain open\nuntil the next pre-prelim set after today’s date. Does that mean and only then, or then\nthey will be withdrawn or will it be – ” The prosecutor interrupted with the following\nremarks: “Your Honor, I did hand written offers to each counsel today. Those will\nremain open until the next pre-prelim hearing date. The People’s understanding, that\nwould be January 13. I don’t want set beyond that.”\n        The next hearing took place on January 13, 2011. Palofox’s eventual trial counsel,\ndeputy public defender Peter Pacheco, appeared with him in court on this date. The\nhearing began with the prosecutor stating: “There were written offers submitted at the last\npre-preliminary hearing on December 3rd. All of those written offers are being\nwithdrawn this date as per the written offer.” Mr. Pacheco responded, “And the record\nshould note, also, your Honor, on behalf of Mr. Palofox, Mr. Dulce was the attorney of\nrecord previously. I do not know whether Mr. Dulce ever discussed the written offer\n\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\fwith Mr. Palofox. However, I am substituting in today for the public defender and I\nguess I’ll need to talk to the DA concerning the written offer.”2\n       The next mention in the record of plea bargaining is found within the transcript of\na hearing held on October 24, 2011. Mr. Pacheco and Palofox were present in court\nwhen the following statements were made:\n\n       Trial Court: “One last thing before I go off the record completely, I want to say\n                    this with the defendants present. We’ve had some discussion in\n                    chambers about the settlement offers that have been made by the\n                    People pursuant to a letter that I understand was provided to all\n                    counsel [i.e., the December 2010 written offer]. Although this may\n                    have been a letter that was provided so early on that some of you\n                    attorneys were not actually counsel of record at this particular point\n                    in time when this was done, it was – as I understand it from you,\n                    [prosecutor], this was a letter that was sent by the District Attorney’s\n                    office making an offer of possible disposition of this case to the\n                    defendants based on a term of years. And it was conveyed before\n                    this case went to grand jury indictment, correct?\n\n       Prosecutor:   That’s correct.\n\n       Trial Court: And from the People’s point of view, at least at the moment, those\n                    offers are considered having been rejected?\n\n       Prosecutor:   That’s correct.\n\n       Trial Court: I’m not going to inquire on the record whether any of you counsel\n                    agree with that interpretation. But I do want to say, and I don’t want\n                    there to be any misunderstanding about this subject, the People have\n                    alleged a gang enhancement on alleged home invasion robberies.\n                    And I think it is understood by all counsel here that at least under\n                    [section] 186.22(b)(4) –\n\n       Prosecutor:   Correct.\n\n       Trial Court: – the penalty for that is 15 years to life in the state prison? No\n                    misunderstanding about that?\n\n       2The written offer does not appear in the record, but the parties agree that Palofox\nwould have been able to plea out for a fixed term of 16 years and 8 months in prison. As\nnoted above, he was ultimately sentenced to an indeterminate term of 30 years to life.\n\n\n                                             8.\n\f       Prosecutor:   That’s correct.\n       The trial court made another reference to the expired December 2010 offer at a\nhearing held on January 6, 2012. Further settlement discussions occurred during\nproceedings conducted on March 29, 2012 and April 12, 2012. Mr. Pacheco and Palofox\nwere present in court on each of these dates.\n       On April 19, 2012, Mr. Pacheco made statements in court upon which Palofox\nnow bases his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We reproduce here the relevant\nportion of the transcript from that hearing:\n\n       Trial Court: And, um, the [current settlement] offer to Mr. Palofox, is it\n                    [33 years]?\n\n       Prosecutor:   It is, Your Honor.\n\n       Trial Court: It is with the 45-year-to-life exposure. That’s you, sir? You\n                    understand all of this?\n\n       Palofox:      Yes, I do.\n\n       Trial Court: You’ve had a chance to talk to Mr. Pacheco about, you know, what\n                    you have at risk, what the case looks like. And you know what the\n                    People’s offer is –\n\n       Palofox:      Yes.\n\n       Trial Court: – right? And you made a decision?\n\n       Palofox:      Yes, I have.\n\n       Trial Court: What do you want to do, sir?\n\n       Palofox:      Take it to trial.\n\n       Trial Court: You are satisfied you know what this – what this means, right?\n\n       Palofox:      Yes, I do.\n\n       Trial Court: And Mr. Pacheco, you are satisfied that Mr. Palofox here knows\n                    what he’s got at risk and is making a reasoned decision in this\n                    matter?\n\n\n\n                                               9.\n\f       Pacheco:      Yes, Your Honor. There was a little wrinkle that we discussed\n                     yesterday. When this case was first assigned it was assigned to\n                     Roberto Dulce. And it was [assigned] to Kathy Marousek. It was –\n                     both left on stress leave. I inherited this case. As [to] the [offer of]\n                     16 years eight months, I believe that was a time sensitive letter that I\n                     was never, um – let’s say due to the transfer of the case to myself\n                     there was an issue whether that was conveyed to Mr. Palofox,\n                     whether it was time sensitive. Um-\n\n       Trial Court: Well –\n\n       Pacheco:      However, that’s the only thing I want to put on the record.\n\n       Trial Court: And I’ve allowed you to put it on the record and you have. But from\n                    your point of view, what does it mean? Should the court do\n                    something?\n\n       Pacheco:      Well, I just wanted the People to know he would have accepted the\n                     16 years, eight months, but for the fact that it was time sensitive.\n                     And he was not advised of that by [his] prior [] counsel. We’re\n                     ready to go on the 21st.\n\n       Trial Court: Anything you want to say about that?\n\n       Prosecutor:   Just that I put all these offers on the record including the time\n                     sensitive nature of them for everyone to hear.\n\n       Trial Court: In other words, you made – you didn’t just send a letter. You\n                    actually stated it in court?\n\n       Prosecutor:   I did both, yes.\n       Palofox’s contention on appeal is that his attorneys failed to make him aware of\nthe time-sensitive nature of the December 2010 offer before it expired. He further\nsubmits that he would have accepted the offer had he known it would only be available\nfor a limited time. The remedy sought is reversal and remand, with an order requiring the\nprosecution to “reoffer” the original plea deal.\nAnalysis\n       “To demonstrate that a defendant has received constitutionally inadequate\nrepresentation by counsel, he or she must show that (1) counsel’s representation was\n\n\n\n                                             10.\n\fdeficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms; and (2) counsel’s deficient performance subjected the defendant to\nprejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s failings, the result\nwould have been more favorable to the defendant.” (In re Alvernaz (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1162685\"><a href=\"/opinion/1162685/in-re-alvernaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n936-937.) Proof of a defense attorney’s failure to adequately advise his or her client\nabout the terms of an offered plea bargain satisfies the element of deficient performance.\n(Id. at p. 937.) To show prejudice in this context, an appellant must further prove there is\na reasonable probability he or she would have accepted the plea bargain but for counsel’s\nsubpar representation. (Ibid.)\n       Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel made on direct appeal are disfavored\nand often unsuitable for review. (People v. Duff (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550, fn. 9 (Duff).\n[“It is rarely appropriate to resolve an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal….”];\nPeople v.

This is particularly true when, as\nhere, elements of the claim cannot be established without further investigation and/or\nconsideration of evidence outside the record. (People v. Williams (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n691.) The appropriate avenue for relief is a petition for writ of habeas corpus. (Id. at pp.\n690-691, 693.)\n       The record before us contains no explanations by attorneys Wong or Dulce of\nwhat they did or did not do during the relevant time period. Mr. Pacheco’s measured\nstatements to the trial court on April 19, 2012 avoided the issue of his own performance\non January 13, 2011, when the prosecution’s original offer had apparently not yet\nexpired. Palofox never presented his side of the story, and does not explain how he\nremained unaware of the time-sensitive nature of the plea offer when he was present in\ncourt during both the December 3, 2010 and January 13, 2011 hearings.3 We cannot\n\n\n\n       3We note Palofox filed a notice of appeal with an attachment containing a\nhandwritten message which reads: “I would really like to appeal on the fact that due to\n\n                                              11.\n\fsimply take it on faith that he received deficient performance and was prejudiced. The\nineffective assistance claim fails for lack of affirmative proof of these elements.\n   II. Wheeler/Batson Motion\n       Leon alleges error in the prosecution’s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse an\nAfrican-American prospective juror. The issue was raised below by Centeno’s trial\ncounsel, who made an objection pursuant to the holdings of People v. Wheeler (1978)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291154/people-v-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Wheeler) and Batson v. Kentucky (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Batson). The other\ndefense attorneys joined in the objection, and Leon’s counsel unsuccessfully moved to\nremedy the alleged error. Centeno, Palofox, and Rivas now summarily join in Leon’s\narguments on appeal. We find no error.\nBackground\n       Jury selection began with a venire of 18 prospective jurors whose racial and ethnic\nbackgrounds are, for the most part, indiscernible from the record. Two members of the\noriginal panel were excused by the trial court during its initial round of questioning and\nreplaced by other people in the jury pool. Peremptory challenges were made after further\nquestioning by the prosecution and each of the four defense attorneys, which resulted in\nthe removal of seven panel members, each of whom was replaced by a new prospective\njuror. The reconstituted panel included Prospective Juror No. 23, hereafter referred to as\n“Juror 23.”\n       Juror 23 is described in the record as an African-American male. His oral voir\ndire responses disclosed a four-year career as a military police officer and an educational\nbackground that included one year of law school. When asked by the trial court if his\nlegal education might impact his ability to remain impartial, he replied, “No. Actually,\nthe reason I stayed is I keep thinking I would – if I was in [the defendants’] shoes I would\n\n\nthe fact I was not properly addressed with a deal that I would have [benefitted] from, due\nto the fact I was not being represented [by] an attorney!”\n\n\n                                             12.\n\fwant somebody on me because I’ve got all the reasons in the world to get out of this.\nBut, you know, I could be fair.” Leon’s trial counsel sought to clarify the meaning of this\nanswer by asking, “I think you said earlier if – these gentlemen who are on trial here\nwould probably want you as a member of their jury. Now, I’m going to ask you to\ncorrect me if I’m wrong, but – well, do you mean by that that you are going to bend over\nbackwards to favor them?” Juror 23 responded, “No, just be fair. That’s all anybody\nwould want is somebody to be fair.”\n       The other defense attorneys questioned Juror 23 about a variety of topics including\nhis views on a defendant’s decision not to testify, the reliability of eyewitness testimony,\nthe reliability of confessions made by suspects to police, and the prosecution’s burden of\nproof. He indicated that a defendant’s decision not to testify would have no impact on\nhis verdict. Regarding eyewitness accounts, he said, “I believe that the eyewitness\nbelieves what they see … but whether that’s the whole truth of the matter, I’d be able to\nexamine all the evidence to make a determination.” He agreed with the proposition that a\nsuspect could be tricked into confessing to something they did not actually do. When\nasked for his thoughts on the prosecution having the sole burden of proof, he replied, “I\nlove it.”\n       After defense counsel had asked their questions, the prosecution made two\ninquiries of Juror 23. The first called for a yes or no answer regarding whether, if\nnecessary, he could bring himself to find a defendant guilty of a crime. He replied,\n“Won’t be – that won’t be my problem.” The prosecutor then said, “Okay. Um, if the\nevidence proves the defendants are guilty, can you come back with a verdict that says ‘I\nfind you guilty?’” His response was, “Yes, I can.” The prosecution passed on its next\nopportunity to exercise a peremptory challenge, and thereafter elected to remove Juror 23\nfrom the panel.\n       The defense objected to the prosecution’s challenge on grounds that Juror 23\n“seemed as down the line and fair as it could get,” was “a person of a particular protected\n\n                                             13.\n\fclass,” and was allegedly one of only two African-American members of the prospective\njuror panel. The Wheeler/Batson motion prompted the following exchange between the\nprosecutor and the trial court:\n\n       Trial Court: [L]et me just ask, first of all, from your point of view, has the prima\n                    facie showing been made? And do you want to be heard with\n                    respect to [Centeno’s attorney’s] representation about the racial\n                    composite of the prospective jurors?\n\n       Prosecutor:   Sure.\n\n       Trial Court: Composition, I should say.\n\n       Prosecutor:   Yes. As I currently have seen, there’s three – there were three\n                     potential jurors in the box that appeared to be African-American.\n                     One is [Prospective Juror No. 10]. The other is [Prospective Juror\n                     No. 30], both of which are still on the panel. The prosecution has\n                     passed as to those two jurors. Um, as to [Juror] 23, the prosecution,\n                     even though I don’t feel a prima facie case has been shown in any\n                     regard, I’ll still offer my reasons.\n\n       Trial Court: Good. Go ahead.\n\n       Prosecutor:   The reason why the prosecution thanked and excused him is for two\n                     reasons. One, he said he had completed a year of law school, and\n                     I’m suspicious of people with a little limited amount of legal training\n                     being left on the jury. Secondly, he volunteered that if he were in\n                     their shoes, and he looked over towards the defendants, he would\n                     want someone like himself on the jury. Now, I understand he\n                     rehabilitated himself in his answers, but that still goes a long way\n                     towards what I believe his initial state of mind was.\n       Next, the trial court addressed the defense attorneys: “Without having concluded,\nas the People have allowed, that there is a prima facie showing here, um, why isn’t that a\nlegitimate reason, the very last thing you heard [the prosecutor] say?” Centeno’s attorney\nsubmitted, without further explanation, that he believed the prosecutor’s challenge was\nracially motivated. Rivas’s lawyer opined that Juror 23’s voir dire responses were\nindicative of fairness and impartiality. Leon’s trial counsel said, “I think there are a\nnumber of people who have told us they had a little bit of legal training that [the\n\n\n                                             14.\n\fprosecution] has passed on. I’m just looking at his sheet; that would include [Prospective\nJuror No. 5]. But a number of people know attorneys or have taken a certain amount of\nlegal education. And [the prosecution] passed on those. And I think that [Juror] 23 was\nrehabilitated in response to – I mean I think that [he] was rehabilitated – was sufficiently\nrehabilitated.” Counsel for Palofox joined in the argument regarding “rehabilitation.”\nAfter considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled as follows:\n\n               I guess all of you are [using the term] rehabilitated – this isn’t a challenge\n       for cause. The fundamental issue before the court is if there’s a prima facie\n       showing that this was a race-based challenge. [The People have conceded] that\n       there is some possible construct of the circumstances [that] might allow for that\n       conclusion. Although it’s the court’s view that – that there is at least one other\n       African-American remaining on the jury on which the People have passed.\n\n              Nevertheless, accepting that this – some court might conclude that there has\n       been a prima facie showing, its seems to me that the issue before this court now is\n       whether there is a neutral ground for – non race-based ground for the prosecution\n       to have exercised that peremptory challenge. And the court is not entitled to\n       reweigh that judgment, no more than the court’s entitled to weigh [] your\n       judgments about the exercise of peremptory challenges. The only real question\n       before the court is whether the court is to disbelieve [] the People’s grounds and\n       find there really isn’t any basis in the record here to support the People’s purported\n       grounds for exercising that peremptory challenge.\n\n              I think under the circumstances there is sufficient demonstration to the\n       court’s satisfaction that there are neutral grounds for the exercise of [the]\n       peremptory challenge. So I’m denying the motion with respect to Wheeler. And\n       that’s why I, frankly, after everything I heard I did not suggest to [Juror] 23 that he\n       should have a seat here in case that the defense might be seeking to reseat him as\n       opposed to starting the whole panel over. But nevertheless the motion is denied.\nAnalysis\n       State and federal law prohibits the use of peremptory challenges to strike\nprospective jurors on the basis of race or ethnicity. (People v. Avila (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515784/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541, citing Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 88; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-\n277.) A three-step procedure is used to evaluate allegations of such discrimination.\n“First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‘by showing that the totality of the\n\n\n                                             15.\n\frelevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.’ [Citation.] Second,\nonce the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the ‘burden shifts to the State to\nexplain adequately the racial exclusion’ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications\nfor the strikes. [Citations.] Third, ‘[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial\ncourt must then decide … whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial\ndiscrimination.’” (Johnson v. California (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799972\"><a href=\"/opinion/799972/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168, fn. omitted.)\n       The parties disagree about whether the existence of a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination is reviewable since the trial judge considered arguments pertaining to the\nthird stage of the Wheeler/Batson analysis. The rule is that “[w]hen a trial court solicits\nan explanation of the strike without first declaring its views on the first stage, we infer an\n‘implied prima facie finding’ of discrimination and proceed directly to review of the\nultimate question of purposeful discrimination.” (People v. Scott (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n387, fn. 1.) Here, the trial court’s equivocal assessment of the threshold question likely\nresulted in an implied prima facie finding. We thus focus on the third stage of the\nanalysis, where “‘the issue comes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutor’s\nrace-neutral explanations to be credible.’” (People v. Lenix (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2584741\"><a href=\"/opinion/2584741/people-v-lenix/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613\n(Lenix), quoting Miller-El v.

We presume the\nprosecution used its peremptory challenges in a lawful manner and accord “great\ndeference to the trial court’s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.”\n(People v. Burgener (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621563/people-v-burgener/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864.) “So long as the trial court makes a\nsincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications offered, its\nconclusions are entitled to deference on appeal.” (Ibid.)\n       The prosecution’s stated reasons for challenging Juror 23 were (1) an aversion to\njurors who possess a “limited amount of legal training” and (2) suspicion of the\nprospective juror’s bias in favor of the defense. Attorneys have the right to strike a\n\n                                              16.\n\fprospective juror “based upon facial expressions, gestures, hunches, and even for\narbitrary or idiosyncratic reasons.” (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) Likewise, “the\nlaw recognizes that a peremptory challenge may be predicated on a broad spectrum of\nevidence suggestive of juror partiality. The evidence may range from the obviously\nserious to the apparently trivial, from the virtually certain to the highly speculative.”\n(Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 275.) Under these well-established principles, the\nprosecution offered permissible, race-neutral grounds for exercising its peremptory\nchallenge.\n         Leon’s trial counsel insinuated that the first explanation was pretextual because\nthe prosecution had supposedly passed on several people who had “a little bit of legal\ntraining,” including Prospective Juror No. 5. The record does not support this contention.\nAlthough Prospective Juror No. 5 said that his father was a civil defense attorney, he\nhimself was a community college student who had plans to matriculate to the Academy\nof Art University in San Francisco. When asked about a basic legal concept, this\nprospective juror claimed ignorance of the prosecution’s burden of proof in a criminal\ntrial.\n         At the time of the Wheeler/Batson motion, three other panel members had\nreferenced educational backgrounds that were tangentially related to the field of law.\nProspective Jurors Nos. 11 and 13 studied criminology at the undergraduate level. The\nlatter individual was excused by the trial court and the former was stricken by the defense\nduring the first round of peremptory challenges. Prospective Juror No. 30 was pursuing a\ndegree in criminal justice. This panel member was also African-American and ultimately\nserved on the jury.\n         Leon points out that no challenges were made against Alternate Juror No. 45, who\nwas added to the panel after the denial of the Wheeler/Batson motion, despite that juror’s\ncareer as a workers’ compensation attorney. This fact is of questionable relevance since\nthe prosecution was allegedly concerned about people with a “limited amount of legal\n\n                                              17.\n\ftraining,” not licensed professionals who had obtained a J.D. and been admitted to the\nstate bar. To the extent the record allows for a comparative juror analysis, such analysis\ndoes not support appellants’ claim of racial discrimination. (See Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat p. 607 [“Comparative juror analysis is evidence that, while subject to inherent\nlimitations, must be considered when reviewing claims of error at Wheeler/Batson’s third\nstage when the defendant relies on such evidence and the record is adequate to permit the\ncomparisons.”].)\n       The prosecutor’s explanation regarding a suspicion of Juror 23’s bias towards the\ndefense was not without evidentiary support. Juror 23 provided a number of ambiguous\nand unusual answers to questions designed to gauge his impartiality, including the\nresponse of “I love it,” when asked about the prosecution’s burden of proof. He was also\nthe only person to speak up when defense counsel asked the panel if any of them believed\nlaw enforcement officers might lie when giving testimony; he said, “I believe that.”\nAlthough Leon insists Juror 23 was an ideal candidate for jury service, the moving\nparty’s favorable opinion of a challenged panelist is not proof that a prosecutor’s race-\nneutral justifications are pretextual. (See People v. Hensley (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 803\n[“The fact that the objector thinks his opponent should feel comfortable with the\ncandidate is not the relevant question. The question is whether the advocate exercising\nthe challenge had an honest and racially neutral reason for doing so.”].) Given the\nplausibility of the prosecutor’s explanations, we must defer to the trial court’s assessment\nof their genuineness. (People v. Silva (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2551919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2551919/people-v-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385-386.)\n       It is also significant that the prosecution made no attempt to challenge Prospective\nJuror No. 30, who was reportedly of the same race as Juror 23. “Although not\nconclusive, the fact that the jury included a member of the group allegedly discriminated\nagainst ‘is an indication of good faith in exercising peremptories.’” (People v. Johnson\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760.) This consideration, combined with the factual\ncircumstances discussed above, leads us to conclude the challenged ruling is supported\n\n                                            18.\n\fby substantial evidence. Therefore, we will not reverse the trial court’s denial of the\nWheeler/Batson motion.\n   III.      Admissibility of Leon’s Custodial Statements to Police\n       Leon made incriminating statements during a recorded interview with law\nenforcement officials on the day of his arrest. A partial audio recording of that interview\nwas played for the jury during the prosecution’s case-in-chief. Although the\nadmissibility of Leon’s confession was not contested at trial, he now asserts that his\nstatements were induced by implied promises of leniency. To circumvent forfeiture of\nthis argument, he alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial attorney’s\nfailure to dispute the voluntariness of his statements. The claim fails under the applicable\nstandard of review.\nForfeiture\n       “Evidence Code section 353, subdivision (a) allows a judgment to be reversed\nbecause of erroneous admission of evidence only if an objection to the evidence or a\nmotion to strike it was ‘timely made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of\nthe objection.’” (People v.

This code section\noperates as a rule of forfeiture (People v. Nelson (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223), even in the\ncontext of a constitutional challenge to the voluntariness of a defendant’s confession\n(People v. Tully (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 979-980, 983, fn.10 (Tully); People v.

Leon’s failure to dispute the voluntariness of his\nconfession at trial makes appellate review impractical because “the parties had no\nincentive to fully litigate this theory below, and the trial court had no opportunity to\nresolve material factual disputes and make necessary factual findings.” (People v. Ray\n(1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1130099\"><a href=\"/opinion/1130099/people-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339.) “Under such circumstances, a claim of involuntariness\ngenerally will not be addressed for the first time on appeal.” (Ibid.) For these reasons,\nLeon’s direct challenge to the admissibility of his confession has been forfeited.\n\n\n\n                                             19.\n\fIneffective Assistance of Counsel\n1. Background\n       Leon and his brother, Eric Rodriguez, were arrested together at their home in\nArizona. They were transported to a local police station in a vehicle equipped with a\nhidden recording device which allowed investigators to hear their conversations with\neach other. Leon told Eric something to the effect of, “Don’t say anything, [just] tell\nthem we went to the beach in California.” When they arrived at police headquarters, the\nbrothers were separated and interrogated. Eric was later brought into Leon’s interview\nroom for joint questioning.\n       After waiving his right to remain silent, Leon responded to questioning by\nDetectives John Willow of the Clovis Police Department, Jon Sims of the Fresno County\nSheriff’s Office, and Dwayne Pavelski of the Merced County Sheriff’s Department. He\nacknowledged taking a road trip to California with a group of people on unspecified\ndates, but said that he could not recall any locations he had visited except for a beach\ntown that began with a “V,” possibly Venice Beach. He feigned ignorance as to why he\nwas being questioned until the detectives told him they were investigating a “crime\nspree” and claimed to “have eyewitnesses that put [him] inside the locations.” Leon\nreacted by saying, “That put me inside? … You got fingerprints though or what? You\ngot proof that I was in there… [?]” After the detectives assured him they had ample\nevidence of his involvement, Leon admitted to participating in the subject events.\n       Leon’s initial admissions were vague. For example, when asked why the group\nhad targeted the home in Clovis, he responded, “I didn’t see no house, I was just right\nthere … I didn’t – I’m telling you right now, I didn’t beat nobody down, I didn’t do\nnothing like that.” He portrayed himself as a peripheral participant in the conspiracy and\ndenied being at three of the five crime scenes. When the detectives pressed him for\ndetails about each incident, he told them, “Honestly, I wanna say like, I didn’t leave all\nthe time, I’m just saying like that one time is when I went and then that one time I was [a]\n\n                                            20.\n\flookout, that’s about it.” He made denials regarding the use of a firearm, but eventually\nadmitted to having a gun in his hand during one of the robberies. By the end of the\ninterview Leon had confessed to being inside of the two homes that were robbed on\nMarch 16, 2010. He and his brother denied having any involvement in the incident that\noccurred at night (i.e., the robbery in Atwater on February 24, 2010).\n       On appeal, Leon claims his trial counsel should have realized the investigators\nmade promises of leniency in exchange for admissions of guilt. He cites first to a\ncomment by Detective Sims during the early stages of the interview: “[W]e’re here to\nhelp you so that we can kind of work as an advocate for the – for you on behalf of the\n[District Attorney], ‘cause the DA wants to, you know, you’ve got this, this, this, this,\nthis, this. Okay, this case, this case, this case, this case. They’ve laid it out.” As the\ninterview progressed, Detective Sims continued to tell Leon that he wanted to “help”\nhim. In the midst of Leon’s denials regarding the use of a gun, the detective said, “Okay,\nlook at me, look at me right in the eyes dude … I need to know this, it’s for you… It’s\nnot for me, it’s for you… help me help you.”\n       Leon also complains of being tricked into believing that expressing remorse would\nengender some form of prosecutorial leniency. Detective Sims urged him to make a\nwritten confession and apology, and said that he would deliver the apology to the district\nattorney. Later, a deputy district attorney from Fresno County named Greg Anderson\ncame into the room and spoke with Leon. The extent of their conversation is unclear\nfrom the record, but the following statements were made concerning the alleged\nsignificance of Leon’s remorse:\n\n       Anderson:      You know, if you have remorse in this case, if you feel remorse for\n                      what you did, okay, let me know, ‘cause that makes a difference.\n                      Okay, there are victims in this case, and they’ve gone through a lot\n                      in this case, um, I know that a number of people in this case have\n                      written letters of apology.\n\n       Leon:          Yeah.\n\n\n                                              21.\n\f       Anderson:     I think that’s a great idea.\n\n       Leon:         Yeah. It’s cause, like – I mean like, I wasn’t planning to do this, I\n                     mean like, I was just like, I was like, I went with them, they’re like\n                     ‘hey, we’re gonna do this’ – so I was just like –\n\n       Anderson:     Yeah, you got caught up in it, you got caught up in the robberies, the\n                     next thing you know it’s happening.\n\n       Leon:         Yeah, yeah.\n\n       Anderson:     If you feel bad about that, this is the time to write that letter, okay?\n                     Because that’s what’s gonna tell the judge and the jury and the\n                     people that you feel bad about it. Okay? And that’s – that’s not a\n                     bad thing, that means you have a conscience. Alright? Which is a\n                     good thing.\n       Following his statements about remorse, Mr. Anderson made the following\nremarks: “I may want you to talk to your brother. ‘Cause your brother ain’t seeing the\nlight. Okay? For some reason when you guys initially had that talk – ok, he’s like no I\nnever was there. Nothing ever happened and everything… and the problem is he’s the\nonly one who is doing that. So if anyone is going down it’s him which is kinda sad.”\n(Original ellipsis.) Leon urges us to interpret the last statement as “implying that\nconfessing meant not going down.” (Original italics.)\n2. Analysis\n       We have already explained that an appellant must establish two things in order to\nprevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim: (1) the performance of his or her\nattorney fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) prejudice occurred as\na result. (Strickland v. Washington (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (Strickland); People v.\nAnderson (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623304/people-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569.) Leon’s briefs gloss over the first prong of the\nanalysis, but we are inclined to agree with respondent that the required showing has not\nbeen made. In any event, the claim fails due to Leon’s inability to establish prejudice.\n       “When examining an ineffective assistance claim, a reviewing court defers to\ncounsel’s reasonable tactical decisions, and there is a presumption counsel acted within\n\n\n                                             22.\n\fthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance. It is particularly difficult to prevail\non an appellate claim of ineffective assistance. On direct appeal, a conviction will be\nreversed for ineffective assistance only if (1) the record affirmatively discloses counsel\nhad no rational tactical purpose for the challenged act or omission, (2) counsel was asked\nfor a reason and failed to provide one, or (3) there simply could be no satisfactory\nexplanation.” (Mai, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p. 1009.) “All other claims of ineffective\nassistance are more appropriately resolved in a habeas corpus proceeding.” (Ibid.)\n       Leon’s arguments speak to the disputed existence of a factual and legal basis for\nmoving to suppress his custodial statements. “There may be cases, however, where for\ntactical reasons counsel foregoes [sic] making a motion [to suppress] even though the\nmotion has merit.” (People v. Gonzalez (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280219\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280219/people-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437, fn. 1\n(Gonzalez).) On the one hand, a defendant’s own confession is generally considered to\nbe the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him. (Skilling\nv. United States (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150540\"><a href=\"/opinion/150540/skilling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383.) On the other hand, Leon’s interview\ncontained numerous denials and mitigating statements. Respondent argues that\nindependent evidence of Leon’s participation in the robberies was strong enough to\njustify a strategic decision to allow his interview statements to come into evidence. In\nother words, defense counsel may have perceived a legitimate benefit in allowing the jury\nto hear Leon deny and/or minimize his role in most of the crimes without having to\nsubject him to cross-examination on the witness stand. (See People v. Kelly (1992)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119859\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119859/people-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521-523 [“Counsel had to make the difficult decision whether on balance\nthe defense would benefit from the jury hearing the tape of defendant’s confession as part\nof the prosecution case-in-chief at the guilt phase. This is precisely the type of tactical\ndecision defense counsel must be allowed to make without fear of appellate second-\nguessing…”].]\n       Respondent supports its position by citing to testimony by the victim of the\nMarch 16, 2010 robbery in Atwater, who claimed to be “one hundred percent” certain\n\n                                             23.\n\fthat Leon was one of the perpetrators who entered his home. The Attorney General\nfurther notes: “Just a few hours after the fifth robbery on McCall Avenue [in Selma],\nLeon and his green Tahoe were both photographed with a group that included\ncoconspirator Beltran, who later pawned a ring stolen in that robbery. In addition, a cell\nphone registered to someone with Leon’s Arizona home address was in the vicinity of all\nfive robberies, while in frequent contact with phones belonging to codefendant Rivas and\ncoconspirators Landeros and Zazueta.” Thus, given the probability of Leon’s conviction\non the counts relating to the two robberies on March 16, 2010, defense counsel could\nhave reasonably concluded that the exculpatory value of his statements about the other\ncrimes outweighed the damaging impact of his admissions.\n       Respondent’s theory is plausible, especially in light of the jury’s verdict. The\ndefense evidence consisted of employment records which ostensibly showed that Leon\nwas in Arizona on February 24, 2010 when the first two robberies were committed.\nHowever, eyewitnesses from both of those incidents not only identified him as one of the\nperpetrators, but also claimed he was the man who viciously attacked an occupant of the\nhouse in Atwater. In light of the conflicting evidence, Leon’s attorney may have wanted\nthe jury to hear his client’s denials in order to bolster his alibi. If this was counsel’s\nstrategy, it is entirely possible that Leon benefited from it since the jury acquitted him of\nall counts arising from the February 24, 2010 robberies.\n       In his reply brief, Leon counters that the potential consequences of true findings\non the gang enhancement allegations negated any strategic benefit of forgoing a motion\nto suppress the interview statements. To accept this argument, we would have to\nspeculate as to defense counsel’s overall assessment of the evidence and his belief in the\nprobability of success at the bifurcated trial on the gang issues. “[W]here counsel’s trial\ntactics or strategic reasons for challenged decisions do not appear on the record, we will\nnot find ineffective assistance of counsel on [direct] appeal unless there could be no\nconceivable reason for counsel’s acts or omissions.” (People v. Weaver (2001)\n\n                                              24.\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633370\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633370/people-v-weaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926.) Leon has not demonstrated that there could be no conceivable\nreason for his trial attorney’s performance in regards to the custodial interview evidence.\nHis claim fails for this reason alone.\n       Were we to assume Leon could clear the first hurdle of the Strickland test, he\nwould still have to show prejudice. “To establish prejudice, however, the defendant must\ndo more than show the motion [his attorney neglected to make] would have been\nmeritorious. When the alleged deficiency is the failure to make a suppression motion, the\ndefendant must show, in addition, the motion would have been successful.” (Gonzalez,\nsupra, 64 Cal.App.4th at p. 438.) Such a showing cannot be made on the present record.\n       According to Leon, a motion to suppress his interview statements would have\nsucceeded on grounds of involuntariness. “‘In general, a confession is considered\nvoluntary “if the accused’s decision to speak is entirely ‘self-motivated’ [citation], i.e., if\nhe freely and voluntarily chooses to speak without ‘any form of compulsion or promise of\nreward. . . .’ [Citation.]” [Citation.] However, where a person in authority makes an\nexpress or clearly implied promise of leniency or advantage for the accused which is a\nmotivating cause of the decision to confess, the confession is involuntary and\ninadmissible as a matter of law.’” (Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at pp. 985-986.) Leon’s\nargument thus raises two distinct questions: were there any promises of leniency, and if\nso, were they the “motivating cause” of his decision to admit guilt? (People v. Linton\n(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176 (Linton); Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 986.) To answer\nthese questions we must evaluate the totality of the circumstances, keeping in mind that\nthe prosecution need only prove voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.\n(Tully, at pp. 986, 993.)\n       We consider first Detective Sims’s stated intention to act as an “advocate” for\nLeon and to “help” him. Such use of the term “help” does not necessarily constitute an\nimplied promise of leniency. (People v. Vance (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277859\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277859/people-v-vance/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Detective Sims may have pushed the envelope by calling himself an\nadvocate, but the vagueness of his statements and lack of any specified terms of quid pro\nquo weigh against a finding of an improper promise.

Holloway (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508855\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508855/people-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117 (Holloway).) Detective Sims and deputy\ndistrict attorney Greg Anderson both treaded close to this line by emphasizing the\nsupposed importance of Leon’s willingness to show remorse. However, the California\nSupreme Court has said “there is nothing improper in pointing out that a jury probably\nwill be more favorably impressed by a confession and a show of remorse than by\ndemonstrably false denials.” (Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 444.) The interrogators\ndid not phrase their statements exactly in this way, but they arguably refrained from\nimplying anything more than the benefits that flow naturally from a truthful and honest\ncourse of conduct. (See Holloway, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 116; People v.

(See People v.

It does not appear Mr. Anderson was attempting to elicit further\nadmissions from Leon. He was most likely trying to increase the chances that Leon’s\nbrother would also provide incriminating statements. We do not interpret the ambiguous\ncomment as implying a benefit to Leon in exchange for Leon’s own admissions.\n       To the extent any of the challenged statements can be construed as improper\npromises, Leon has not established the element of causation. This is due in part to his\nfailure to provide an adequate record, which is admittedly a consequence of the issue\nnever being litigated at trial (and underscores why the claim should have been raised, if at\nall, by way of a habeas corpus petition). He presents us with two alternate transcripts of\nhis interview, but both are redacted and show gaps of unknown length between various\nquestions and answers. Each version contains material not present in the other, with\nsome statements being cut off in mid-sentence. We cannot conduct a proper analysis\nwithout knowing facts such as the amount of time that elapsed between the alleged\npromises of leniency and Leon’s statements of admission, and whether intervening\nquestions or discussions may have had a causal effect on his decision to reveal certain\ninformation.\n       Notwithstanding the incomplete record, we are unconvinced that the alleged\npromises of leniency were the motivating cause of Leon’s admissions. He seems instead\nto have been affected by the extent of the investigators’ knowledge of the crimes and a\ndesire to separate himself from those whose involvement in the conspiracy was allegedly\nmore extensive and egregious than his own. Accordingly, and for the reasons explained\nabove, the claim must be rejected.\n   IV. Admissibility of Centeno’s Custodial Statements to Police\n       Centeno also disputes the voluntariness of a confession he made to law\nenforcement officers during a custodial interview. Like Leon, he argues his incriminating\nstatements were induced by promises of leniency. The parties seem to agree that the\nissue was not preserved for appellate review. The claim is therefore characterized as one\n\n                                            27.\n\fof ineffective assistance of counsel. Based on the limited evidence in the record, Centeno\ncannot satisfy his burden of demonstrating a causal connection between the alleged\npromises of leniency and his admissions of guilt. We are thus constrained to uphold the\njudgment regardless of whether any improper promises were made during his\ninterrogation.\nBackground\n       Centeno was interrogated at a juvenile detention facility in Arizona. According to\nhis probation report, he was being held at the facility on unrelated charges when\ndetectives spoke with him about the events in this case. His age at the time of the\ninterrogation was approximately 17 years and 5 months.\n       Our knowledge of what occurred during the custodial interview is limited to the\ncontents of a 20-page transcript containing portions of the questioning, but the transcript\nhas been redacted to an unknown degree. The length of the interview is also unknown.\nThe entire session was reportedly documented in an audio recording, but we have only\nheard a 29-minute excerpt that was played for the jury, which corresponds to a slightly\ndifferent and shorter transcript used at trial.4\n       The material in the record begins during a question and answer session between\nCenteno and Detective Alexander Archuleta of the Phoenix Police Department, then\nseemingly cuts to Detective Dwayne Pavelski advising the suspect of his Miranda rights\n(Miranda v. Arizona (1966) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miranda)). After Centeno confirms his\nunderstanding of the Miranda advisement, Detective Pavelski transitions into series of\nnarratives which include anecdotes from his own life, commentary about the criminal\n\n\n       4 Neither Leon nor Centeno designated the partial audio recordings of their police\ninterviews for inclusion in the record on appeal. Those items, respectively marked as\nPeople’s Exhibits Nos. 621 and 623, were transmitted at our request. (Cal. Rules of\nCourt, rules 8.224(d) [transmission of exhibits] and 8.320(e) [exhibits admitted in\nevidence are deemed part of the record in a criminal appeal].)\n\n\n                                              28.\n\fjustice system, and contentions regarding the importance of a forthright confession. His\nlengthy statements are separated by Centeno’s occasional responses of “Mm-hmm” and\n“Yeah.” In the edited audio recording, approximately 14 minutes of such exchanges\nprecede Centeno’s disclosure of information about the conspiracy and acknowledgment\nof his role in two of the robberies.\n       Centeno claims Detective Pavelski promised him leniency in exchange for\nadmissions by saying things like, “I’m the guy that steps in and actually works to defend\nyou, in a way…” and “I need your side of the story so I can speak for you.” Centeno\nfurther objects to certain misrepresentations about the legal consequences of his actions.\nThese arguments are based on the following excerpts:\n\n       Pavelski:      […] I believe in getting the truth, because if you shut down and tell\n                      me, ‘I’m not saying nothing to you,’ that means I can’t get up and\n                      speak for you and say, ‘this, no – this is what actually happened.’\n                      Because I can prove everything.\n\n       Centeno:       Yeah.\n\n       Pavelski:      They’ve already done it. That’s why I’m here now. My job is to get\n                      up and say, ‘look, Victor did take part in something, he fucked up,’\n                      I’m not gonna say that in court, but –\n\n       Centeno:       Say I messed up.\n\n       Pavelski:      Yeah. I’m gonna say, you know, he – he made a bad decision\n                      because he’s a juvenile for one, but this is what actually happened,\n                      he was, he shows that he can be rehabilitated because he was honest\n                      and he actually told the truth about everything that happened. He\n                      was sorry for what he did. He was influenced by his friends or\n                      something like that. […] Um, and, you know, it comes to mind, do\n                      you even realize, has anybody ever told you why juveniles are\n                      separated from adults? Why you go to a different jail?\n\n       Centeno:       Nah.\n\n       Pavelski:      It’s not just because you’re under eighteen. That’s just a formality.\n                      The real-\n\n\n\n                                             29.\n\fCenteno:    Probably influenced by them.\n\nPavelski:   Not even that. It’s because the state of Arizona, actually, it’s every\n            state in the United States, believes that a minor can be reabil –\n            rehabilitated. That’s why your guys’ sentences for whatever crime is\n            different. They don’t just smack three years on you for something.\n            They – they look at, is he able to be rehabilitated, and then they base\n            your sentence on your personality, what it is you did, how you\n            cooperated with cops, how you talk, how you present yourself, and\n            that kinda deal. And then they go, okay, does this guy need\n            probation or does he need some jail time, and while he’s in jail, he’ll\n            probably have to do these classes, all that kinda stuff.\n\nCenteno:    Mm-hmm.\n\nPavelski:   Because they want to see that you are able to be reab – rehabilitated\n            so they can put you in society and you’re gonna be productive and\n            lead a good life at some point. […]\n            So, that’s why I need your truth, because everybody else has talked.\n            And I’ve told everybody the same thing, that I talked to, is, we\n            didn’t come from California because we think we – you did it, we\n            came because we know you did it, and that’s not even a question, I\n            can see you’re agreeing with me by nodding your head.\n\nCenteno:    Yeah.\n\nPavelski:   Um, my job here is to make sure I get your side of it. About all of it.\n            So I know that when things go to court, I’m going ‘no, he shouldn’t\n            get charged with that,’ or the DA’s office will go ‘no, he shouldn’t\n            get charged with that, he shouldn’t get charged with that.’ Um,\n            matter of fact, we have a DA that I can talk to, and that will talk to\n            you, when we’re done, to let you know, like, okay, hey, this is\n            what’s happening, but um, he comes because I come. Because I’m\n            the one, the guys at work always freaking make fun of me, they\n            think I picked the wrong occupation, I shoulda been a freaking\n            lawyer, but, because I want to be able to present you as the kid that\n            made the mistake that’s gonna be rehabilitated, not the kid that is the\n            hardened criminal, that went [unintelligible].\n\nCenteno:    Yeah.\n\nPavelski    Um, it would benefit you to be as detailed as you could with me, and\n            I also wanna know how you were feeling during all this time. […]\n\n\n\n                                   30.\n\f       On the eighth day of trial, Centeno’s attorney, Linden Lindahl, requested a hearing\npursuant to Evidence Code section 402 to determine the validity of his client’s Miranda\nwaiver. Before the hearing started, the trial court said, “Counsel, just to clarify here, this\nis a very limited issue which, although I think to some degree defense has earlier waived,\nwe’re going to allow it to be heard in any event having to do with the admissibility of\nMr. Centeno’s statement, whether he was properly Mirandized and his statement was\notherwise voluntary. Just that limited subject.” The hearing itself consisted of testimony\nfrom Detective Pavelski, who was briefly questioned about the Miranda advisement.\nMr. Lindahl’s questions focused on the detective’s failure to solicit an explicit waiver\nfrom Centeno after Centeno said that he understood his rights.\n       At the conclusion of Detective Pavelski’s testimony, Mr. Lindahl argued: “Your\nHonor, I would submit that this was not a full and complete Miranda advisement in that\nafter reading the minor at that time his rights, they launched into an interrogation without\nasking him whether he wished to exercise his rights. I feel a combination of the\ndetective’s presence and his youthfulness, it’s my position that [his] will was overborne\nand he wasn’t fully advised. I’d ask his statement be excluded as a Miranda violation.”\nThe prosecution argued that an implied waiver had been made. The trial court ruled as\nfollows: “Under the circumstances, I’m satisfied that the preponderance of the evidence\ndemonstrated that the defendant was advised of his rights and understood them and\nanswered questions voluntarily. And that, therefore, the statements [are] otherwise\nadmissible in the People’s case-in-chief if they seek to use [them]. That’s subject, of\ncourse, to the redactions that I think the two of you have already agreed to.”\nForfeiture\n       When challenged, a Miranda waiver must be “shown by a preponderance of the\nevidence to be voluntary, knowing and intelligent under the totality of the circumstances\nsurrounding the interrogation. [Citations.] The waiver must be ‘voluntary in the sense\nthat it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,\n\n                                             31.\n\for deception’ [citation], and knowing in the sense that it was ‘made with a full awareness\nof both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to\nabandon it.’” (People v. Sauceda-Contreras (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219.) Here, the\nparties’ arguments and the trial court’s analysis focused on the knowing and intelligent\nnature of the Miranda waiver. To the extent the trial court evaluated voluntariness, it did\nso exclusively in regards to the motivation behind Centeno’s initial waiver of his right to\nremain silent, and without consideration of any interrogation tactics employed thereafter.\n       A claim of erroneously admitted evidence is cognizable on appeal only if the\noriginal challenge to the evidence was timely and specific. (Evid. Code, § 353, subd. (a);\nPeople v. Abel (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844212\"><a href=\"/opinion/844212/people-v-abel/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924 [review of trial court’s admission of evidence\nis limited to the stated grounds for the objection].) Such challenges must be specific\nenough to “fairly inform the trial court, as well as the party offering the evidence, of the\nspecific reason or reasons the objecting party believes the evidence should be excluded,\nso the party offering the evidence can respond appropriately and the court can make a\nfully informed ruling.” (People v. Partida (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576438/people-v-partida/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435.) Pursuant to these\nrules, “[a] defendant ordinarily forfeits elements of a voluntariness claim that were not\nraised below.” (Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 435.)\n       The trial court was never asked to consider whether Centeno’s admissions were\ninfluenced by promises of leniency, and does not appear to have reviewed any recordings\nor transcripts of the interrogation in conjunction with its ruling on the admissibility of his\nstatements. Centeno all but concedes respondent’s forfeiture argument, emphasizing that\nthe failure to allege promises of leniency as a ground for suppression is the very reason\nwhy his trial attorney’s performance was constitutionally deficient. We agree that the\nissue was forfeited, and will consider the question of voluntariness only within the\ncontext of the ineffective assistance claim.5\n\n       5In this instance, we are not persuaded by respondent’s argument that defense\ncounsel may have “strategically declined to exclude favorable statements” by his client.\n\n                                             32.\n\fAnalysis\n       “The use of deceptive statements during an investigation does not invalidate a\nconfession as involuntary unless the deception is the type likely to procure an untrue\nstatement.” (People v. McCurdy (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088.) However,\nmisrepresentations that involve promises of leniency are prohibited. (Cahill, supra,\n22 Cal.App.4th at p. 315.) Detective Pavelski obviously lied to Centeno about being tried\nas a juvenile and receiving more lenient treatment than an adult could expect under the\nsame circumstances. Centeno makes a compelling argument that these tactics were\nimproper, especially when combined with the detective’s insinuation that he had the\nability to influence certain aspects of the case.\n       The challenged comments are fairly interpreted as implying that Detective\nPavelski could play a role in deciding what charges would be filed against Centeno. (Cf.\nCarrington, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 174 [“The interviewing officers did not suggest they\ncould influence the decisions of the district attorney, but simply informed defendant that\nfull cooperation might be beneficial in an unspecified way.”].) The other implication was\nthat Centeno’s punishment would be dependent upon his cooperation with police. The\nrepeated emphasis on “rehabilitation” suggested his sentence would be less harsh if a\njudge found him capable of being rehabilitated, and the clear message was that the\nlikelihood of such a finding would increase if he confessed (in which case the detective\nwould advocate for leniency on his behalf) and decrease if he did not confess.\n       Despite the strength of Centeno’s argument regarding promises of leniency, we are\nunable to conclude that a suppression motion on grounds of involuntariness would have\nbeen successful. The viability of such a motion would have hinged on the element of\n\n\nThe proposition is illogical given the defense attorney’s effort to suppress the statements\non other grounds. Furthermore, unlike Leon, Centeno was not identified by any of the\nvictims. The prosecution’s case against Centeno was entirely circumstantial save for the\nevidence of his admissions during the custodial interview.\n\n\n                                              33.\n\fcausation, i.e., whether an improper promise was the motivating cause of his decision to\nconfess, and no single factor is dispositive of that issue.

Williams (1997)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661 [rejecting the view that an offer of leniency necessarily renders a\nstatement involuntary].) The ultimate question is “‘whether the defendant’s “will was\noverborne at the time he confessed.”’” (People v. McWhorter (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590326/people-v-mcwhorter/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n346-347 (McWhorter).) To answer this question, we would need to evaluate “the totality\nof all the surrounding circumstances – both the characteristics of the accused and the\ndetails of the interrogation.” (Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108800\"><a href=\"/opinion/108800/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226\n(Schneckloth); accord, Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1176.) Due to the state of the\nrecord, we do not know the totality of the relevant circumstances.\n       The voluntariness of a confession is subject to independent review on direct appeal\nif the relevant facts have been “actually and reliably determined.” (Jackson v. Denno\n(1964) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380; see People v.

Ordinarily, the facts\nsurrounding a defendant’s confession are considered undisputed if the interrogation was\nmemorialized in an audio or video recording, and it is the undisputed nature of the facts\nthat makes de novo review possible in that scenario. (Duff, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 551.)\nHowever, the recording must be complete or at least substantially reliable in terms of its\nportrayal of the circumstances that led to the defendant’s decision to confess. (See\nMcWhorter, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 347-348 [trial court properly examined the totality\nof the circumstances by viewing recording of police interview in its entirety, not “in\nsnippets or parts”].) Because Centeno’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nrequires analysis of circumstances that are unknown due to evidentiary gaps in the record,\nthe missing evidence must be construed against him.

Centeno’s probation\nreport indicates that he was a minor and had only completed the eighth grade. Both of\nthose factors weigh in his favor. On the other hand, he was about seven months away\nfrom his eighteenth birthday and had been arrested four times since the age of 16, which\nsuggests a familiarity with law enforcement procedures and the legal system. The brief\nexcerpt of his interview with Detective Archuleta (prior to his exchanges with Detective\nPavelski) shows him complaining that police officers searched through his cell phone\nduring a recent arrest and questioning whether the searches were allowed without his\npermission. On balance, Centeno appears to be at least moderately intelligent and\ncapable of making rational decisions for himself.\n       Relevant “details of the interrogation” include evidence of the location, length,\nand continuity of the interview, the nature of the questioning (such as aggressive,\nrepeated, or prolonged questioning), the use of physical force or deprivation of food or\nsleep, and the lack of advice as to the defendant’s constitutional rights. (Schneckloth,\nsupra, 412 U.S. at p. 226; Carrington, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 175; Boyette, supra,\n29 Cal.4th at p. 411.) The record discloses little in terms of the setting where Centeno’s\ninterview occurred or the factors of length and continuity. The tone of the interview\nseems calm and conversational. As best we can tell, Centeno waived his rights freely and\nprovided incriminating statements without any hesitation. There are no obvious signs\n\n                                             35.\n\fthat his will to resist confessing was overborne. To the extent the audio recording\nprovides a reliable timeline, he began to admit guilt within 15 minutes of speaking with\nDetective Pavelski.\n       Although promises of leniency are a significant consideration in the overall\nanalysis, we are left with questions regarding the extent to which detectives may have\nrevealed to Centeno what they already knew about the crimes and whether he was\nmotivated by a desire to partially exculpate himself, minimize his involvement, or simply\nclear his conscience. For example, Detective Pavelski makes casual references to a prior\nconversation with “Isabelle,” who is identified elsewhere in the record as Centeno’s\ngirlfriend. We infer from the redacted transcript that Centeno made incriminating\nstatements of remorse to Isabelle, she conveyed some or all of those statements to police,\nand Centeno was aware of this fact at the time of his interview with Detective Pavelski.\nWithout a complete picture of what occurred during his interview, we cannot conclude\nthat his burden of showing reversible error on the basis of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel has been met. (See People v. Williams, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 691 [concluding\nappellant’s ineffective assistance claims “can be fully addressed only in a habeas corpus\npetition because they require investigation of evidence outside the record in order to\npotentially establish prejudice.”].)\n   V. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n       Appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions\nfor assault with a semiautomatic firearm as alleged in Count 13 of the indictment. They\nargue the prosecution failed to establish the semiautomatic characteristics of the\nweapon(s) used in the offense. Rivas additionally argues that his conviction under\nCount 4 for attempting to dissuade a witness within the meaning of section 136.1,\nsubdivision (c)(1) lacks evidentiary support. Respondent concedes only the latter\nargument. We agree with appellants on both issues.\n\n\n\n                                            36.\n\fStandard of Review\n       “To determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, an appellate\ncourt reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine\nwhether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, from which a\nrational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” (People\nv.

We suspect the prosecution elected to charge appellants as it did in light of\nMr. Guzman’s testimony before the grand jury, during which he claimed to be\n“experienced with weapons,” confirmed his ability to distinguish between\n“semiautomatic firearms as opposed to revolvers,” and testified to being assaulted with a\n“semiautomatic handgun.” His trial testimony, however, did not include those details.\n       At trial, Mr. Guzman described encountering eight to ten men inside of his home,\nall of whom were armed with handguns, which he referred to as “pistols.” He responded\naffirmatively when the prosecutor asked if he knew the difference between a pistol and a\nrifle, but no further explanation of the term “pistol” was asked for or provided.\nMr. Guzman thereafter testified to being knocked to the ground, beaten, and tied up\nduring the robbery. An unidentified man had stood over him with a “pistol” while he was\n\n                                            37.\n\flying on the floor. He watched as the man “cock[ed] back the gun,” aimed at his leg, and\npulled the trigger. The gun made a “trigger noise” but did not fire.\n       Section 245, subdivision (a)(2) provides: “Any person who commits an assault\nupon the person of another with a firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state\nprison for two, three, or four years….” In comparison, section 245, subdivision (b),\nstates: “Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a\nsemiautomatic firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three,\nsix, or nine years.” (Italics added.) The statute does not define “semiautomatic firearm,”\nbut our Supreme Court has described the term in other contexts as referring to a gun that\n“‘fires once for each pull on the trigger and reloads automatically, but requires the\nshooter to release the trigger lever before another shot can be fired.’” (In re Jorge M.\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874, fn. 4, quoting Walter, Rifles of the World (2d ed. 1998)\np. 498.) This broad definition encompasses most types of modern handguns, and\narguably includes revolvers.\n       The jury below was instructed on the elements of assault with a semiautomatic\nfirearm pursuant to CALCRIM No. 875. The instruction reads, in pertinent part: “A\nfirearm is any device designed to be used as a weapon, from which a projectile is\ndischarged or expelled through a barrel by the force of an explosion or other form of\ncombustion. [¶] A semiautomatic pistol extracts a fired cartridge and chambers a fresh\ncartridge with each single pull of the trigger.”\n       The drafters of CALCRIM No. 875 took the definition of a “semiautomatic pistol”\n(italics added) from section 17140, which appears in an unrelated part of the Penal Code\ndevoted to the control of deadly weapons. (Judicial Council of Cal., Crim. Jury Instns.\n(2015) Bench Notes to CALCRIM No. 875, p. 667; see § 16000.) Section 17140 is\nexpressly intended to define “semiautomatic pistol” as that term is used in sections 16900\nand 31910. If section 17140 is applicable to section 245, subdivision (b), then the legal\ndefinition of a “semiautomatic firearm” is narrowed to exclude revolvers. (See People v.\n\n                                             38.\n\fDokins (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We question whether the\nLegislature intended to make such a nuanced distinction, as it would effectively\nencourage criminals to choose revolvers over of other types of handguns when\ncommitting certain crimes.6 Earlier versions of section 245, subdivision (b) proscribed\nassault with a “semiautomatic rifle,” and the amendment which replaced that term with\n“semiautomatic firearm” was apparently done to broaden the scope of the statute. (Stats\n1993, ch. 369 § 1 (AB 1344) and explanatory notes for same [“substituted ‘firearm’ for\n‘rifle’ after ‘semiautomatic’ wherever it appears in subds (b) and (d)(2)”]; Assem. Com.\non Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1344 (1993–1994 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 13,\n1993.) We need not resolve this question of statutory interpretation since the prosecution\nfailed to introduce any evidence concerning the mechanical operation of the gun or guns\nthat were used in the Count 13 offense.\n       The Attorney General argues that Mr. Guzman’s use of the word “pistol” provided\nsufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude he was assaulted with a semiautomatic\nfirearm under the definition provided in CALCRIM No. 875. She submits that in\ncommon parlance, “a ‘pistol’ is usually, though not always, synonymous with a\nsemiautomatic handgun,” and a revolver is generally not considered to be a type of pistol.\nA number of secondary sources are cited in support of these contentions. Respondent’s\nneed to resort to extrinsic authorities only demonstrates that such matters are not of\nuniversal common knowledge and experience. If Mr. Guzman understood his use of the\nword “pistol” to be synonymous with the legal definition of a “semiautomatic firearm”\n(whatever that may be), it was the prosecution’s burden to elicit that information during\n\n       6 CALCRIM pattern instructions are the official instructions for use in the criminal\ncourts of this state, but “are not themselves the law, and are not authority to establish\nlegal propositions or precedent. … At most, when they are accurate, … they restate the\nlaw.” (People v.

In the absence of such testimony, and without any further evidence of the\ntype of weapon(s) used, the jury had no basis upon which to conclude beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the victim was assaulted with a semiautomatic firearm.\n       Respondent also argues that the verdict is supported by circumstantial evidence.\nA victim of the second robbery committed on February 24, 2010 (which occurred almost\nthree weeks before the assault of Mr. Guzman) testified to seeing an unidentified\nperpetrator holding a semiautomatic nine-millimeter gun. The victim was able to provide\nthose details because he personally owned the same type of weapon. Elsewhere in the\nrecord is testimony from Deputy Robert Woodrum, who offered hearsay statements about\nhis conversation with a non-victim eyewitness who allegedly claimed to have seen\nEstevan Landeros hand a “silver revolver” to Palofox on one occasion, and also saw\nLanderos in possession of a semiautomatic gun at a hotel on the night of March 16,\n2010.7 Since Landeros was identified as a participant in both the February 24 and\nMarch 16 robberies, respondent infers he likely used a semiautomatic firearm while\nrobbing Mr. Guzman’s home. In addition, Palofox was reportedly found in possession of\na nine-millimeter “semiautomatic pistol” during a traffic stop conducted in Arizona on\nMarch 29, 2010, and police discovered a “.45 caliber semiautomatic Ruger handgun”\nduring a search of his living space in May of that year.\n       The relationship of the facts relied upon by respondent to the assault on\nMr. Guzman are too attenuated to constitute substantial evidence of guilt under\nsection 245, subdivision (b). Even if the necessary inferences could be drawn from those\ncircumstances, the witnesses who made references to “semiautomatic” guns testified in\nnon-expert capacities and offered no insight into their own understanding of that\nterminology. The jury had no way of knowing if any of the weapons used in any of the\n\n       7 Interestingly enough, the eyewitness’s trial testimony described the weapon\ngiven to Palofox as a silver “pistol.” She had no memory of seeing any guns at the\nreferenced hotel.\n\n\n                                            40.\n\frobberies actually satisfied the definition provided in the CALCRIM No. 875 instruction.\nTherefore, appellants’ convictions for assault with a semiautomatic firearm must be\nreversed.\n       Appellants do not otherwise dispute that a firearm was used to assault\nMr. Guzman. Assault with an unspecified type of firearm in violation of section 245,\nsubdivision (a)(2) is a lesser included offense of assault with a semiautomatic firearm as\nproscribed by subdivision (b) of the same code section.

Because victim Darshan Walia was\ndeceased at the time of trial, the prosecution relied on the testimony of Gurmuph Singh to\nprove the elements of the offense. Mr. Singh’s testimony described his encounter with\nfive armed intruders who ransacked his home in search of “gold and cash.” The robbers\n\n                                            41.\n\fwere in the house for approximately 30 minutes, during which time they brought him into\nhis living room, made him lie face down on the floor, and tied up his legs with “electrical\nwires.” Mr. Singh also testified that the men “took off all the receivers” from the\ntelephones in the home. When the prosecutor asked for clarification of this testimony, he\nreplied, “They picked up all the receivers so we can’t talk to anybody.”\n       Section 136.1 addresses multiple forms of witness intimidation.\n“Subdivision (a)(1) proscribes knowingly and maliciously preventing or dissuading any\nwitness or victim from attending or giving testimony at any trial, proceeding, or inquiry\nauthorized by law, and subdivision (a)(2) proscribes attempting to do so.” (People v.\nTorres (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

It is enough to show the defendant attempted to “prevent or dissuade\nanother person who has been the victim of a crime or who is witness to a crime from …\n[m]aking any report of that victimization to any peace officer or state or local law\nenforcement officer….” (§ 136.1, subd.

The\n\n                                            43.\n\fonly remaining question is whether his violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1)\nconstituted a lesser included offense of the crime for which he was convicted.\n       “Two tests have traditionally been applied in determining whether an uncharged\noffense is necessarily included within a charged offense – the statutory or legal\n‘elements’ test and the ‘accusatory pleading’ test.

The elements test asks whether the statutory elements\nof the greater offense include all of the statutory elements of the lesser offense. (Ibid.)\nPut differently, “‘where an offense cannot be committed without necessarily committing\nanother offense, the latter is a necessarily included offense.’” (People v.

Under the accusatory pleading test, an uncharged offense is\nincluded within the charged offense if the facts alleged in the accusatory pleading include\nall of the elements of the uncharged crime. (Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 117.)\n       Under the elements test, a violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1) is\nnecessarily included within the offenses set forth in section 136.1, subdivision (c).\n(People v.

The accusatory pleadings test\nshows that the factual allegations in Count 4 encompassed every element of subdivision\n(b)(1), and thus provided Rivas with adequate notice of his potential liability for this\nlesser included offense. Therefore, we find it appropriate to modify the judgment to\nreflect a conviction under Count 4 for attempting to prevent a victim or witness from\nreporting a crime in violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1). Rivas is to be\nresentenced accordingly on remand. Since the lesser included offense is a “wobbler,” the\ntrial court will have discretion to treat the conviction as either a felony or a misdemeanor.\n(§ 17, subd. (b); People v.

Gang Findings\n       A bifurcated jury trial was conducted as to the gang-related allegations in Counts\n9, 11, and 16. Each of those counts involved the substantive offense of robbery\ncommitted within an inhabited dwelling house and in concert with two or more other\n\n                                             44.\n\fpersons (§§ 211, 213, subd. (a)(1)(A)). The gang allegations were made pursuant to\nsection 186.22, subdivision (b), which provides for increased punishment when an\noffense is committed “for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any\ncriminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal\nconduct by gang members.” (Id., subd. (b)(1) and (4).) The jury’s findings ultimately\ndetermined whether appellants received life sentences (Centeno, Leon, and Palofox) or a\nsentence for a term of years (Rivas).8\n       The prosecution argued that appellants knowingly committed the underlying\noffenses in association with members of a criminal street gang, and were therefore liable\nunder section 186.22, subdivision (b) regardless of their personal gang affiliations or lack\nthereof. To support this theory, evidence was presented regarding admissions made by\ncertain individuals during jail classification interviews that followed their arrest for the\nsubject robberies, including those of third party accomplices/co-conspirators Gilbert\n\n\n       8  Most felonies committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association\nwith a criminal street gang are subject to the enhancement of an additional prison term\nranging from two to ten years. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(A)-(C).) However, if the gang-\nrelated crime is a “home invasion robbery,” the defendant faces a sentence of 15 years to\nlife. (Id., subd. (b)(4)(B); People v. Jones (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801877\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801877/people-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 (Jones).) Section\n186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B) is not an enhancement, but rather an “alternate penalty\nprovision,” meaning it sets forth an alternate penalty for the underlying offense if the jury\nfinds the conditions specified in the provision have been satisfied. (Jones, supra, 47\nCal.4th at p. 576.) Standing alone, a home invasion robbery conviction carries a\nmaximum sentence of nine years in prison. (§ 213, subd. (a)(1)(A).) If the offense is\nfound to be gang-related within the meaning of section 186.22, the punishment is life in\nprison with a minimum parole eligibility period of 15 years. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(4)(B).)\n       We note the indictment actually cited to section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), which\nis an enhancement provision, and made no reference to subdivision (b)(4)(B). Appellants\ndo not allege prejudice in this regard, and thus impliedly acknowledge that they received\nadequate notice of their potential exposure to a life sentence under the alternate penalty\nprovision.

Evidence of\nan admission made by Centeno during the jail intake process was introduced over an\nobjection that it was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. Leon, Palofox, and\nRivas each denied having gang ties during their own jail classification interviews, but the\njury learned Palofox subsequently admitted his gang status in conjunction with a request\nto be transferred out of general population housing for safety reasons. The gang\nallegations were found true as to Centeno, Leon, and Palofox, but not true with respect to\nRivas.\n         On appeal, Centeno renews his Miranda objection and summarily joins in\narguments made by Leon. Leon’s briefing challenges all of the prosecution’s jail\nclassification evidence on grounds that its admission contravened Miranda principles and\nresulted in a violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution. In a related argument, Leon contends that the prosecution\nintroduced testimonial hearsay through the opinions of its gang expert in violation of his\nconstitutional right to confront adverse witnesses. Palofox summarily joins in the\npositions taken by Centeno and Leon.\n         During the pendency of this appeal, the California Supreme Court issued its\ndecision in Elizalde, supra, which addresses and resolves the Miranda issue raised by\nCenteno. It is now settled that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is\nimplicated when law enforcement officers ask “routine questions about gang affiliation”\nwhile processing a defendant into jail. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 527.) As will be\nexplained, the admission of evidence concerning Centeno’s jail classification statements\nwas erroneous under Elizalde. The more difficult question is whether the error was\nprejudicial, and the answer depends in part on the admissibility of the statements made by\naccomplices/co-conspirators who were not parties to the case. We conclude appellants\ndo not have standing to assert the constitutional rights of those third parties, nor could\nthey have asserted their own Sixth Amendment confrontation rights as a basis for\n\n                                             46.\n\fexcluding evidence of the third-party admissions. Given the significance of the\naccomplices’ self-incriminating statements in combination with other admissible\nevidence presented at trial, the violation of Centeno’s Miranda rights did not constitute\nreversible error.\nAdditional Background Information\n       Trial of the gang allegations began with a hearing conducted pursuant to Evidence\nCode section 402 in regards to Centeno’s jail classification admissions. The trial court\nhad previously advised defense counsel of its belief that the law was “fairly settled” in\nterms of there being “no grounds for arguing that there’s some kind of Fifth Amendment\nviolation” in the use of such evidence. Each defendant was given the opportunity to\nargue otherwise, but only Centeno chose to do so. Relying on pre-Elizalde case law, the\ntrial court ruled that Centeno’s statements during the jail intake process were admissible.\n       The prosecution’s case-in-chief included testimony by correctional officers from\nthe Fresno County jail. Witness Cynthia Diaz described herself as a “jail classification\nofficer” or “population management officer.” Her duties involved placing inmates in the\nappropriate custodial setting based on their responses to a standardized intake interview.\nThe process required interviewees to answer questions listed on a pre-printed form,\nincluding, “Do you associate with any street/prison gangs? If yes, explain.” All inmates\nwere required to review and sign their completed form.\n       Officer Diaz conducted two classification interviews with Estevan Landeros. She\nobserved and documented the presence of tattoos on his body of the words “South Side”\nand of three dots grouped together in a triangular pattern. Recognizing the tattoos as\nbeing indicative of a connection to the “Sureno” gang, Officer Diaz was skeptical when\nLanderos initially denied being a gang member or associate. During the second\ninterview, she advised him that he needed to answer the gang association question\ntruthfully for his own safety. At trial she explained: “If he denied then I would have to\nput him in general population, [where] we have rival gangs and he would be assaulted.”\n\n                                            47.\n\fThe majority of inmates in general population housing were members of the regional\n“Bulldogs” gang, which viewed the Surenos as a rival group. Landeros eventually\ninformed Officer Diaz that he “associated with the Surenos.”\n        The correctional officer who interviewed Centeno testified that he admitted to\nbeing a “Sureno from Phoenix.” Christian Rodriguez similarly identified himself as a\n“Phoenix Sureno” during his jail classification interview. Christopher Escobedo admitted\nto being a “South Side associate from Phoenix,” and Gilbert Beltran claimed to be a\n“South Sider from Phoenix.” Beltran and Escobedo were noted to have tattoos of the\nletters “SS.” Escobedo reportedly obtained a three-dot tattoo subsequent to his admission\ninto the jail.\n        Detective Andrew Simonson of the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department testified\nas the prosecution’s gang expert. He explained, based on his training and experience,\nthat the Sureno criminal street gang is controlled by a prison gang known as the\n“Mexican Mafia.” Since most members of the Mexican Mafia are “locked down in\nprotective housing units throughout the state and federal system,” they rely on the\nSurenos to act as their “foot soldiers” outside of prison, generating money for the\norganization through criminal activity.\n        The Surenos have a nationwide presence and commonly identify with certain\nwords and symbols. The name itself translates to “southerner,” and terms such as “sur”\n(meaning “south”) “south side” or “south sider” are often used to indicate a Sureno\naffiliation. The number 13 has significance to Surenos because the thirteenth letter of the\nalphabet is “M,” which to them connotes the Mexican Mafia. Gang members will display\nthe number 13 using Roman numerals or a symbol from the Mayan numbering system of\ntwo horizontal lines underneath three dots. According to Detective Simonson, the most\ncommon tattoo used by Surenos to signify their membership is three dots grouped\ntogether in a triangular pattern.\n\n\n\n                                            48.\n\f       Detective Simonson opined that appellants and their accomplices were all Sureno\nmembers or associates. His opinions with respect to the accomplices were primarily\nbased on their admissions during jail classification interviews. The expert stressed that\nhe considered such admissions to be the most reliable form of evidence to determine gang\naffiliation (“For us it’s basically a stand-alone criteria”). As a practical matter, gang\nmembers are motived by “self-preservation” to answer jail classification questions\ntruthfully because “[t]hey don’t want to be placed in housing with rival gang members\nwhere they can be killed [or] assaulted.” Falsely claiming association with a particular\ngang can also be deadly. In Detective Simonson’s experience, the occupants of a\nsegregated Sureno “pod” will assault or kill non-Surenos if such individuals are housed\nwith them.\n       Leon denied having gang ties during his classification interview and was\naccordingly housed in a minimum security location. Nevertheless, Detective Simonson\nbelieved Leon was a Sureno “associate.” The expert had personally participated in the\nexecution of a search warrant at Leon’s residence in Arizona, and had observed\ndistinctive gang graffiti displayed in various locations on the property. He testified to\nseeing the number 13 carved into trees near the trailer in which Leon was living, and, in\nother locations, the three-dot imagery, the words “South Side” and “Hayden Park,” and\nthe letters “SS” and “VHPLS.” The letters VHPLS purportedly stood for “Vario Hayden\nPark Locos,” a Phoenix area subset of the Surenos. Photographs of the graffiti were\nadmitted into evidence.\n       The expert’s opinions about Leon were further based on his review of police\nreports and other information provided to him by members of the Phoenix Police\nDepartment. According to those sources, Leon had previously been seen wearing gang\nclothing and was known to associate with Estevan Landeros. Phoenix police believed\nLanderos and Leon were both part of the Vario Hayden Park Locos.\n\n\n\n                                             49.\n\f       As to Centeno, the expert relied on “jail classifications as well as Phoenix Police\nreports.” These records indicated that Centeno had gang tattoos and belonged to a\nSureno subset known as the “Vario Happy Homes Locos.” He was also known to\nassociate with Palofox and Gilbert Beltran.\n       On direct examination, Detective Simonson opined that Palofox was a Sureno\nmember based upon his review of “the Phoenix Police reports as well as local\nclassification documents.” On cross-examination, Palofox’s attorney elicited testimony\nfrom the expert regarding his client’s denial of gang membership during a classification\ninterview at the Fresno County Jail – information not previously disclosed in front of the\njury. Defense counsel also successfully moved to have Palofox’s signed jail\nclassification questionnaire admitted into evidence. This line of questioning led to the\nrevelation that Palofox had later requested to be transferred from general population\nhousing out of fear for his safety: “Originally he was placed with Bulldogs. He was – he\ntold the CO that the Bulldogs overheard him talking to his family and stated he slipped.\nAnd then he admitted to the classification officers that he was a South Sider and he no\nlonger [felt] comfortable housed with any Bulldogs.”\n       Finally, with respect to Rivas, the expert acknowledged there was no evidence to\nindicate he was a gang member. Detective Simonson believed Rivas had associated with\ngang members through his involvement with the codefendants and other accomplices, but\nconceded there was no evidence Rivas actually knew those individuals were members of\na gang. As stated above, the gang allegations against Rivas were found not to be true.\nThe Elizalde Decision\n       In Elizalde, the California Supreme Court considered “whether routine questions\nabout gang affiliation, posed to [a] defendant while processing him into jail on murder\ncharges, come within Miranda’s well-recognized booking exception.” (Elizalde, supra,\n61 Cal.4th at p. 527.) The key holding of the opinion is as follows: “Gang affiliation\nquestions do not conform to the narrow exception contemplated in [Rhode Island v. Innis\n\n                                              50.\n\f(1980) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Innis)] and [Pennsylvania v.

Instead, they\nmust be measured under the general Innis test, which defines as ‘interrogation’ questions\nthe police should know are ‘reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.’”\n(Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 538.) Whether or not a gang-related inquiry by jail\npersonnel requires a Miranda admonition will depend on the nature of the charges the\ninmate is facing.\n       The Elizalde defendant was asked gang affiliation questions by sheriff’s deputies\nwho were aware he had been charged with murder but did not know the offense was\ngang-related. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 529.) Ignorance of the latter circumstance\nwas immaterial because murder is “a crime frequently committed for the benefit of\ncriminal street gangs, and a qualifying offense establishing a ‘“pattern of criminal gang\nactivity”’” for purposes of section 186.22. Therefore, the questions were likely to elicit\nan incriminating response and needed to be prefaced with a Miranda admonition, “even if\nthe deputies’ subjective intention was benign.” (Elizalde, at p. 540.) “While officers\nwere permitted to ask these questions for institutional security purposes, defendant’s un-\nMirandized responses were inadmissible against him during the [prosecution’s] case-in-\nchief.” (Id. at p. 527.)\n       Under Elizalde, Centeno’s objection to the admission of his jail classification\nstatements should have been sustained. The jail classification officer who interviewed\nhim knew of his connection to the other inmates from Arizona, and the record indicates\nthe officer would have also been aware of his charges. As discussed in footnote 8, ante,\nrobbery in concert in violation of section 213, subdivision (a)(1)(A) is subject to\npunishment under the alternate penalty provision in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B).\nThese circumstances made it reasonably likely that the gang affiliation question would\nelicit an incriminating response, and a Miranda admonishment was therefore required.\n\n\n\n                                            51.\n\f       Palofox’s situation does not fit squarely within the parameters of the Elizalde\ndecision. It appears he approached correctional officers on his own accord and\nvolunteered information about his gang status in conjunction with a request for alternate\nhousing arrangements. The record does not demonstrate that his admission was the\nproduct of interrogation. He has made no effort to argue this issue on appeal, and we will\nnot endeavor to make arguments on his behalf. (See People v. Bryant, Smith and\nWheeler (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 [although joinder of claims is broadly permitted,\n“‘each appellant has the burden of demonstrating error and prejudice’”].) Under current\nlaw, a gang expert’s opinion may be based on hearsay, and when testifying, he or she\nmay describe the material that forms the basis for their opinion. (People v. Gardeley\n(1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122997/people-v-gardeley/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618.) We therefore assume Detective Simonson’s testimony in\nregards to Palofox’s admission was permissible.\nDue Process Considerations\n       Leon claims his due process rights were violated by the admission of evidence of\nhis co-conspirators’ jail classification statements. He argues those statements were\ncoerced in that each person faced a Hobson’s choice of providing self-incriminating\ninformation or jeopardizing their personal safety by being housed with rival gang\nmembers. Leon further alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial\nattorney’s failure to make these arguments below.\n       “It is settled that the accused has no standing to object to a violation of another’s\nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.” (People v. Badgett (1995)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265814\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265814/people-v-badgett/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (Badgett).) However, a defendant does have limited standing to\nassert that his own due process right to a fair trial has been violated through the\nadmission of improperly obtained statements made by a third party. (Williams, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 452; People v. Jenkins (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195356/people-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 966 (Jenkins).) This\nrelatively uncommon issue has arisen in the context of a challenge to coerced trial\ntestimony, and in relation to the “fruits” of a third party’s involuntary out-of-court\n\n                                             52.\n\fstatements. (Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 452-454; Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at pp.\n966-967; Badgett, supra, 10 Cal.4th at pp. 342-348; People v.

Leon cites to most of\nthese cases in his briefs, but provides no further authority regarding due process\nchallenges to the type of evidence at issue here.\n       “The violation of a third party’s privilege against self-incrimination may deprive a\ndefendant of his or her due process rights if such action adversely affects the reliability of\ntestimony offered against defendant at trial.” (Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 966.)\n“[W]hen the defendant’s claim is based upon the involuntariness of a third party’s\nstatement, the exclusionary rule applicable to a claimed violation of the privilege against\nself-incrimination does not apply. [Citation.] Rather, the defendant may prevail only by\ndemonstrating fundamental unfairness at trial, normally by establishing that evidence to\nbe produced at trial was made unreliable by coercion.” (Ibid.; see Badgett, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 348 [“Testimony of third parties that is offered at trial should not be\nsubject to exclusion unless the defendant demonstrates that improper coercion has\nimpaired the reliability of the testimony.”].)\n       Respondent argues there is no due process violation under the framework set forth\nin cases such as Jenkins and Badgett because the circumstances in which the statements\nof Leon’s co-conspirators were made, and the independent evidence of their gang\naffiliations, overwhelmingly demonstrate that the admissions were reliable. Leon does\nnot disagree with the reliability argument, but submits that a due process violation should\nbe found because the third-party admissions were procured by “outrageous police\nmisconduct.” We find respondent’s argument to be more persuasive given the authorities\nupon which the parties have relied. The Elizalde decision may inevitably lead to future\nclaims that even Mirandized jail classification admissions are inherently coercive, but we\nneed not resolve that issue in order to dispose of Leon’s current claim. The ineffective\nassistance claim fails pursuant to the foregoing analysis and given the state of the law at\n\n                                             53.\n\fthe time of trial. (See People v. Welch (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1314019\"><a href=\"/opinion/1314019/people-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 [“Reviewing courts\nhave traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection\nwould have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence.”].)\nSixth Amendment Considerations\n       Leon alleges a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under Crawford v.\nWashington (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Crawford). Two categories of evidence are relevant to\nhis claim. He describes the first category as “hearsay evidence from Phoenix police,”\nreferring to the documents and verbal information Detective Simonson obtained from\nArizona law enforcement officers and relied upon in forming his expert opinions. The\nsecond category is comprised of the jail classification admissions of his codefendants and\nthird-party accomplices.\n       “The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution,\nmade applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that ‘[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him.’ The right of confrontation includes the right of cross-\nexamination.” (People v. Fletcher (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135884\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135884/people-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455.) In Crawford, the United\nStates Supreme Court held that the confrontation clause bars the admission of out-of-\ncourt testimonial hearsay statements except when “the declarant is unavailable …” and\nthe defendant “had a prior opportunity to cross-examine” the declarant. (Crawford,\nsupra, 541 U.S. at p. 59.)\n       The issue of whether a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is\nviolated by a gang expert’s reliance on testimonial hearsay is currently pending before\nthe California Supreme Court. (People v. Sanchez, review granted May 14, 2014,\nS216681; People v. Archuleta, review granted June 11, 2014, S218640 [briefing deferred\npending consideration and disposition of Sanchez]; People v. Eberhart, review granted\nNovember 24, 2015, S229864 [same].) We decline to speculate as to how the issue will\nbe decided, and conclude the verdict in this case would have been the same even without\n\n                                             54.\n\fDetective Simonson’s testimony regarding the contents of Phoenix police reports and his\nconversations with out-of-state law enforcement officers. (See further discussion, infra.)\nThe outcome would likely have been different if appellants’ Sixth Amendment rights\nwere implicated by evidence of their accomplices’ jail classification admissions, but for\nthe reasons that follow we conclude those admissions were not “testimonial” for purposes\nof Crawford.\n       In Elizalde, our Supreme Court determined that jail classification interviews are a\nform of custodial interrogation for purposes of the Fifth Amendment insofar as the\nquestioning is likely to elicit an incriminating response. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at\np. 531, 538-539.) However, while responses to such interrogation may be considered\n“testimonial” in a Fifth Amendment context, the same is not necessarily true for purposes\nof the Sixth Amendment. (Id. at p. 533, fn. 7.) The Elizalde opinion contains a footnote\non this point that states, in pertinent part: “This case in no way implicates the court’s\nCrawford jurisprudence.” (Ibid.)\n       The Crawford opinion does not define the term “testimonial,” but says it “applies\nat a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a\nformer trial; and to police interrogations.” (Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 68.) As\noriginally decided, Crawford left no room for debate over the last category: “Statements\ntaken by police officers in the course of interrogations are [] testimonial under even a\nnarrow standard.” (Id. at p. 52.) The high court revised its position in Davis v.\nWashington (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145641\"><a href=\"/opinion/145641/davis-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Davis) to make an exception for emergency situations.\nThe Davis case instructs that “[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course\nof police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary\npurpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\nThey are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such\nongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or\nprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” (Davis, supra, 547\n\n                                             55.\n\fU.S. at p. 822.) This aspect of the opinion has come to be known as the “primary\npurpose” test. (Ohio v. Clark (2015) ___ U.S. ___ [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2809764\"><a href=\"/opinion/2809764/ohio-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2179] (Clark).)\n       Since Davis, the United States Supreme Court has adopted the view that “not all\nthose questioned by the police are witnesses” for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and\nnot all “‘interrogations by law enforcement officers’ [citation], are subject to the\nConfrontation Clause.’” (Michigan v. Bryant (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (Bryant), quoting\nCrawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 53.) Hearsay evidence must now satisfy the primary\npurpose test in order to be considered testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\nright to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. (Clark, supra, __ U.S. at p. __\n[135 S.Ct. at p. 2180]; People v. Chism (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1288-1289 (Chism).) In\nits current formulation, the test asks whether the statement at issue was “procured with a\nprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.” (Bryant,\nsupra, 562 U.S. at p. 358.) The California Supreme Court has described the test in\nsubstantially similar terms: “First, to be testimonial the statement must be made with\nsome degree of formality or solemnity. Second, the statement is testimonial only if its\nprimary purpose pertains in some fashion to a criminal prosecution.” (People v. Dungo\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619.)\n       The primary purpose test is essentially a totality of the circumstances analysis.\n“[T]he relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved\nin a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have\nhad, as ascertained from the individuals’ statements and actions and the circumstances in\nwhich the encounter occurred.” (Bryant, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 360.) “In the end, the\nquestion is whether, in light of all the circumstances, viewed objectively, the ‘primary\npurpose’ of the conversation was to ‘creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for trial\ntestimony.’” (Clark, supra, __ U.S. at p. __ [135 S.Ct. at p. 2180].) “‘Where no such\nprimary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal\nrules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.’” (Ibid.)\n\n                                             56.\n\f       Here, the statements in dispute were made with a sufficient degree of formality.\nHowever, we cannot conclude the primary purpose of those statements – from the\nperspective of either the person asking the questions or the person answering them – was\nto create an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony or to otherwise contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution. Nothing suggests that Leon’s codefendants and\nthird-party accomplices disclosed gang membership or affiliation for the purpose of\nmaking a confession against themselves or an accusation against someone else.\nLikewise, based on all of the available evidence, including testimony by the correctional\nofficers who appeared at trial, we are convinced the primary purpose for the gang\naffiliation questions was to further institutional security objectives, i.e., to ensure the\nsafety of inmates and jail personnel. The answers to those questions also had evidentiary\nvalue from a prosecutorial standpoint, but the objective primary purpose “reasonable\nparticipants would have had” in this context was not the creation of an out-of-court\nsubstitute for trial testimony. (Bryant, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 360.) Therefore, appellants\ndid not have a Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine each other or their accomplices\nabout the jail classification admissions.\nPrejudice\n       The erroneous admission of a jail classification statement obtained in violation of\nMiranda is reviewed for prejudice under the standard articulated in Chapman v.\nCalifornia (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. (Elizalde, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 542.) The People must\nshow, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the jury’s verdict.\n(Ibid.) “‘To say that an error did not contribute to the ensuing verdict is … to find that\nerror unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in\nquestion, as revealed in the record.’ [Citation.] Thus, the focus is what the jury actually\ndecided and whether the error might have tainted its decision.” (People v. Neal (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2588587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2588587/people-v-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86.) The error in Elizalde was found to be harmless because the defendant’s\ngang connections were established through independent evidence.\n\n                                              57.\n\f       Focusing on what the jury actually decided in this case, we cannot ignore its\nfindings as to Rivas. Both Leon and Rivas denied having gang ties during their jail\nclassification interviews, but only Rivas was exonerated. Rivas stood apart from his co-\nconspirators as the only member of the conspiracy from California. The other men\nresided in or around Phoenix, Arizona. Rivas’s only apparent connection to the group\nwas that he had dated Estevan Landeros’s sister during the relevant time period. When\nRivas took the stand in the first phase of trial, he denied having any involvement in the\nrobberies and claimed to be barely acquainted with Landeros.\n       A trier of fact can rationally infer a crime was committed “in association” with a\ncriminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b) if the\ndefendant committed the offense in concert with gang members. (People v. Morales\n(2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2266131\"><a href=\"/opinion/2266131/people-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Albillar (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2373689\"><a href=\"/opinion/2373689/people-v-albillar/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67, italics omitted.) Rivas was convicted of\nparticipating in all five robberies, and there was overwhelming evidence that the crimes\nwere committed in association with gang members, yet the jury found the section 186.22\nsubdivision (b) allegations not true. Assuming jurors followed the instructions they were\ngiven, the only logical explanation for this outcome is that they believed Rivas did not\nactually know his accomplices were members of a gang. In assessing the potential for\nprejudice in the admission of Centeno’s jail classification statements, we must consider\nwhether the absence of such evidence could have raised similar doubts as to Leon,\nCenteno, and/or Palofox.\n       Only Leon and Rivas were convicted on Count 9, i.e., the robbery which took\nplace in Kerman on March 15, 2010. Because Centeno was not accused of participating\nin this offense, it stands to reason that his jail classification statements did not impact the\njury’s findings with respect to Leon on that count. Since the jury impliedly found Rivas\n\n                                              58.\n\fwas neither a gang member nor gang associate, it would appear Leon’s culpability under\nsection 186.22 was based on his association with the third-party accomplices, most likely\nEstevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez. Numerous victims had identified Landeros\nand Rodriguez to police and/or during their trial testimony, and both men were alleged to\nhave participated in all five robberies.\n       Cell phone evidence showed Leon was in contact with Landeros during the course\nof the conspiracy. Eyewitness testimony also placed Leon and Landeros together on\nvarious dates. Their connection to one another was sufficiently established even without\nthe information contained in the Phoenix police reports, which certainly reinforced the\nother evidence of Leon’s gang ties. Unlike with Rivas, Leon’s familiarity with the\nSurenos could be inferred from the gang graffiti displayed outside of his residence. The\ngraffiti evidence was based on Detective Simonson’s personal observations rather than\nhearsay, and the corresponding photographs were admitted at trial. In summary, the\nrecord demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the gang finding for Leon on Count 9\nwould have been the same with or without evidence of Centeno’s jail classification\nadmission.\n       Counts 11 and 16 respectively pertained to the robberies in Atwater and Selma on\nMarch 16, 2010. Since each appellant was convicted of these crimes, Palofox’s\nadmission of gang membership effectively forecloses any claims of prejudice by Leon\nand Centeno. As to them, the section 186.22 findings were further substantiated by the\nadmissions of their co-conspirators, most of whom were further shown to be Sureno\nmembers through evidence of their gang tattoos. Cell phone records indicated that\nCenteno had calls on March 16, 2010 to or from phones associated with Gilbert Beltran,\nChristopher Escobedo, and Christian Rodriguez. His phone was in regular contact with a\nnumber associated with Christian Rodriguez during February and March of that year.\nThus, even without evidence of his jail classification admission, it was firmly established\n\n\n\n                                            59.\n\fthat Centeno committed Counts 11 and 16 in association with gang members and with the\nintent to further or assist in the conduct of gang members.\n       Palofox’s gang findings were established through his own admissions and by\nevidence of co-defendant Leon’s gang associations. The victim of the Count 11 robbery\nhad also identified Estevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez as being among the\nperpetrators who entered his home, thus removing any doubt about the gang-related\nnature of that offense. The Count 16 findings were further established by evidence of\nGilbert Beltran’s involvement. Beltran pawned a ring that was stolen during this robbery\nafter the group returned to Arizona. Palofox was reportedly living with Beltran at the\ntime of his arrest, and the jury heard recordings of a discussion between Palofox and\nBeltran in which both incriminated themselves. For all of these reasons, it is evident\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the jury’s verdict was not tainted by the erroneous\nadmission of Centeno’s jail classification statements.\nSentencing\n   A. Consecutive Sentences for Gang-Related Home Invasion Robberies\n       Centeno, Leon, and Palofox received consecutive sentences of 15 years to life for\ntheir gang-related robbery convictions pursuant to the trial court’s conclusion that such\npunishment was mandatory under the holding of People v. Felix (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291712\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291712/people-v-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Felix). As a result, Leon’s convictions on Counts 9, 11, and 16 resulted in an aggregate\nterm of 45 years to life in prison. Centeno and Palofox each received sentences of 30\nyears to life for their convictions on Counts 11 and 16. On appeal, Centeno and Palofox\nargue the trial court misconstrued the Felix decision and acted under a mistaken belief\nthat it had no discretion to impose concurrent sentences for any of the robbery\nconvictions. Leon summarily joins in this claim.\n       The Attorney General submits that the issue is forfeited as a result of appellants’\nfailure to object at the time of sentencing. However, she impliedly concedes the merits of\nappellants’ argument by urging us to find, to the extent the claim is reviewable, that “the\n\n                                            60.\n\ftrial court fully understood its discretionary power” and “properly exercised its discretion\nto select consecutive sentences.” We conclude appellants have carried their burden of\nestablishing error.\n       Regarding forfeiture, the error complained of may fall within a narrow class of\nsentencing issues that are reviewable in the absence of a timely objection. “‘Failure to\nexercise a discretion conferred and compelled by law constitutes a denial of a fair hearing\nand a deprivation of fundamental procedural rights, and thus requires reversal.\n[Citations.]’ [Citation] Where, as here, a sentence choice is based on an erroneous\nunderstanding of the law, the matter must be remanded for an informed determination.”\n(People v.

Background\n       At Leon’s sentencing hearing, defense counsel made statements regarding the\nanticipated length of his client’s sentence given the section 186.22, subdivision (b)\nfindings. Following a response by the prosecutor, the trial court said: “People [v.] Felix,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291712\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291712/people-v-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> in 2000. California Supreme Court directly concluded that indeterminate\nterms of this nature must be served fully consecutive to each other… We all fully\nunderstand it whether we agree with it or not. When I say ‘we,’ I mean the defense, not\nnecessarily the court.” Later, during the pronouncement of sentence, the court stated:\n“I’m ordering you committed to the Department of Corrections on count – each of these\ncounts Nine, Eleven, and Sixteen as required by law to the term of 15 years to life. Each\nof those 15 year-to-life terms to run consecutive to each other as pursuant to the case\nauthority that I just referenced here on the record.”\n\n\n\n                                             61.\n\f       While sentencing Centeno, the trial court indicated that it would have been\ninclined to grant him leniency if it had discretion to do so. The relevant statements were\nas follows:\n\n       “The issue, of course, is what sentence the court should impose. And it seems to\n       me I would agree with the prosecution that in light of everything that I’ve read\n       here, that the court really does not have authority to do otherwise but to impose the\n       sentences with respect to Counts Eleven and Sixteen. But I want to say, in\n       fairness to Mr. Centeno here, and to some future court evaluating this, that if the\n       court believed and understood that it did have the authority to exercise discretion, I\n       might. I might have done that with respect to Mr. Centeno, primarily because of\n       his age and his involvement with a lot of other adults who certainly should have\n       known better.\n\n       And so, you know, I think I want to make – leave that door open here, because I\n       don’t know what the Appellate Court might do in the future on this subject. But\n       this is a situation where, given his limited involvement in this matter and his age\n       as a minor – that’s the most important thing in this court’s view, being a minor at\n       the time of the commission of these crimes – that the court might have exercised\n       its discretion to do other than impose life terms on this case. But in the court’s\n       view, for the reasons that counsel here from the People have a cited authority\n       which is primarily the case of [[People v.

And in this court’s view, therefore, is not subject to relief under\n       [section] 186.22(g) that the defense has asked the court to make – grant a motion\n       to strike. This is, in fact, an alternate sentence for this crime. And the court has\n       no authority but to impose that alternate sentence.\n\n       And under the cases that I think I’ve cited earlier, and I’ll make reference to now,\n       which is People [v.] Felix, that’s </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291712\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291712/people-v-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, F-E-L-I-X, that’s a 2000 decision\n       of the California Supreme Court, Mr. Lindahl. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291712\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291712/people-v-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Essentially, what\n       that says is where there is separate home invasion robberies they are required to be\n       served fully consecutive – mandatory full consecutive terms…[T]he mandatory\n       sentence, the only sentence this court can impose is 30 years to life.”\n       The trial court referenced Felix yet again during the pronouncement of sentence\nfor Palofox: “…I do agree with your attorney, however, that in light of your personal\ninvolvement that there is no good reason in this court’s view to impose any consecutive\n\n\n\n                                            62.\n\fsentencing on the other counts which are, essentially, derivative. Therefore, under\nPeople [v.] Felix which I’ve cited earlier and in light of the jury’s findings in this matter,\nI am ordering you with respect to Counts Eleven and [Sixteen] to be committed to the\nDepartment of Corrections for the term of 15 years to life in each of those counts.”\n2. Analysis\n       Contrary to the statements of the trial court, the Felix case does not involve\nalternate penalty provisions, nor does it reference home invasion robberies or section\n186.22. The opinion addresses how enhancements are applied to indeterminate\nsentences. (Felix, supra, 22 Cal.4th at pp. 654-659.) A term of imprisonment for life or\na specified number of years to life is an indeterminate sentence for purposes of\nCalifornia’s statutory sentencing scheme (§ 1170, et seq.). (Felix, supra, 22 Cal.4th at\npp. 657-659.) The Felix opinion merely holds that if a trial court elects to impose\nconsecutive sentences for two or more offenses that require indeterminate life terms, any\nenhancements attached thereto must be imposed for the full term of the enhancement,\nrather than one-third of the term as would ordinarily be done under the determinate\nsentencing laws. (Id. at p. 655-656.)\n       Under section 669, a trial court has discretion to determine whether to impose\nsentences consecutively or concurrently. The existence of such discretion is explicitly\nrecognized in the Felix opinion. (Felix, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 655 [“Whenever a person\nis convicted of two or more crimes, the court must impose either concurrent or\nconsecutive sentences. (§ 669.)”].) The Legislature may remove this discretion for\ncertain crimes, but exceptions are typically made clear in the statutory language of the\noffense. (See, e.g., § 667.6, subd. (d) [sex crimes committed under specified\ncircumstances]; § 4501.5 [battery committed by a prisoner against a non-prisoner].)\nUnless otherwise prohibited by statute, sentences for crimes that carry indeterminate life\nterms may be imposed concurrently. “That the court’s authority to impose either\nconcurrent or consecutive sentences includes life sentences is made clear by further\n\n                                              63.\n\flanguage in section 669, which provides: ‘Life sentences, whether with or without the\npossibility of parole, may be imposed to run consecutively with one another, with any\nterm imposed for applicable enhancements, or with any other term of imprisonment for a\nfelony conviction.’” (In re Maes (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2265250\"><a href=\"/opinion/2265250/in-re-maes/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1099.)\n       The trial court seems to have conflated two different provisions of section 186.22.\nSubdivision (b)(1) of the statute provides: “Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5),\nany person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of,\nor in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote,\nfurther, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that\nfelony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or\nattempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished [in accordance with\nsubdivision (b)(1)(A), (B) or (C)].” (Italics added.) In contrast, subdivision (b)(4)\nprovides, in pertinent part: “Any person who is convicted of a felony enumerated in this\nparagraph committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any\ncriminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal\nconduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, be sentenced to an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate\nsentence calculated as the greater of … (B) Imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years,\nif the felony is a home invasion robbery, in violation of subparagraph (A) of paragraph\n(1) of subdivision (a) of Section 213…”\n       As previously discussed, section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) is an enhancement\nprovision, while subdivision (b)(4) of the statute is an alternate penalty provision. (Jones,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 576; People v. Briceno (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2582113\"><a href=\"/opinion/2582113/people-v-briceno/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460, fn. 7.) The\nlatter does not expressly require consecutive sentencing. Trial courts have discretion\nunder section 669 to impose concurrent sentences for multiple convictions of crimes\nsubject to the alternate penalty of 15 years to life under section 186.22, subdivision\n(b)(4)(B), and Felix does not hold otherwise.\n\n                                             64.\n\f       Relief from a trial court’s misunderstanding of its sentencing discretion is\navailable on direct appeal when such misapprehension is affirmatively demonstrated by\nthe record. (See People v. Meloney (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1151; People v.

Here, the trial court’s repeated citation to Felix, combined\nwith statements regarding its purported lack of discretion to impose anything other than\nconsecutive sentences for the gang-related home invasion robberies, is most reasonably\ninterpreted as confusion over the scope of its sentencing authority. Since the record does\nnot conclusively show whether the trial court would have exercised its discretion to\nimpose concurrent terms on the robbery convictions if it had known that it had such\ndiscretion, appellants are entitled to relief. (People v. Gamble (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252993\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252993/people-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The appropriate remedy is a limited remand to give the trial court an\nopportunity to exercise its discretion under section 669 as to Counts 9, 11, and 16. (Ibid;\naccord, People v. Belmontes (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348, fn. 8; People v.

On remand, the trial court shall exercise its\ndiscretion to run the sentences for these counts consecutively or concurrently, and state\nthe reasons for its decision.9 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.406(b)(5).)\n\n\n\n\n       9 The transcript excerpts quoted above also reflect the trial court’s consideration of\na separate issue concerning whether it had discretion to strike the gang findings to\ncircumvent the alternate penalty requirements of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4).\nSimilar questions are currently pending before the California Supreme Court. (People v.\nVenegas, review granted Dec. 10, 2014, S221923; People v. Fuentes, review granted\nAug. 13, 2014, S219109.) We express no opinion on the issue, as it is not properly\nbefore us in this appeal. Remand on Counts 9, 11, and 16 shall be solely limited to the\ncourt’s discretion to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences.\n\n\n                                             65.\n\f   B. Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n       Centeno contends that the indeterminate sentence of 30 years to life in prison is a\n“de facto” sentence of life without parole, which, given that he was a 17-year-old juvenile\nat the time of the offenses, violates the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual\npunishment. The claim is effectively mooted by our remand for further proceedings on\nthe counts upon which his sentence is based. His argument is also meritless.\n       A prison term falling within the Legislature’s sentencing guidelines is considered\ncruel and unusual punishment in only the rarest of circumstances. (People v. Martinez\n(1999) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494.) In People v. Caballero (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Caballero), our Supreme Court held that “sentencing a juvenile offender for a\nnonhomicide offense to a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the\njuvenile offender’s natural life expectancy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.” (Id. at p. 268.) The Caballero defendant was\nsentenced to 110 years to life for a gang-related attempted murder offense committed\nwhen he was 16 years old. (Id. at p. 265.) The length of the sentence was characterized\nas a de facto term of life without the possibility of parole. (Id. at p. 269, fn. 5.)\n       The trial court below observed that Centeno’s sentence of 30 years to life would\nmake him eligible for parole by the time he is 49 years old, “which is clearly not outside\nof any natural life expectancy he might have.” Centeno has not refuted this finding on\nappeal. Furthermore, the enactment of section 3051 ensures he will be eligible for release\non parole during his 20th year of incarceration. (§ 3051, subd. (b)(2).) We thus reject his\ncruel and unusual punishment claim.\n   C. Section 654 Issues\n       Appellants raise challenges under section 654 to the trial court’s imposition of\ncertain concurrent and consecutive sentences which they argue should have been stayed.\nPalofox and Rivas allege error in relation to Counts 13 and 14 with respect to the crimes\nof assault with a firearm and making criminal threats. Only Rivas was sentenced to\n\n                                              66.\n\fconsecutive terms for these offenses. Palofox and Rivas further complain of concurrent\nsentences imposed for their convictions of vehicle theft in Counts 8 (Rivas only), 15, and\n18. Centeno and Leon summarily join in these arguments to the extent they are relevant\nto their own sentences.\nApplicable Law\n       Section 654 prohibits multiple punishment for crimes arising out of a single act or\nindivisible course of conduct. (Id., subd, (a); People v. Hester (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196992\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196992/people-v-hester/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n294.) The defendant’s intent and objective determines whether two crimes are part of an\nindivisible course of conduct. (People v. Harrison (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1175468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1175468/people-v-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335.) “When a\ntrial court sentences a defendant to separate terms without making an express finding the\ndefendant entertained separate objectives, the trial court is deemed to have made an\nimplied finding each offense had a separate objective.” (People v. Islas (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129.) Such findings are upheld on appeal if supported by substantial\nevidence. (Ibid.)\n       In the absence of separate and distinct objectives, it is error to impose concurrent\nsentences instead of staying the execution of sentence for those convictions to which\nsection 654 applies. Errors of this nature are reviewable on appeal regardless of whether\na timely objection was made at the time of sentencing. (People v. Brents (2012)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844221\"><a href=\"/opinion/844221/people-v-brents/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618.) “Accordingly, although there appears to be little practical\ndifference between imposing concurrent sentences, as the trial court did, and staying\nsentence on two of the convictions,” we must consider the merits of appellants’\narguments. (People v. Jones (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353.)\nCriminal Threats and Aggravated Assault\n       Counts 13 and 14 pertained to the incident involving victim Fernando Guzman.\nOur modification of the judgment to reflect convictions under Count 13 of assault with a\nfirearm (§ 245, subd. (a)) does not alter the section 654 analysis. Appellants were\nconvicted under Count 14 of making criminal threats in violation of section 422. Rivas\n\n                                            67.\n\fand Palofox submit that threatening Mr. Guzman and assaulting him with a firearm\ncomprised a single act done pursuant to the objective of making him comply with their\ndemands for money. The trial court was not persuaded by this argument, nor are we.\n       Mr. Guzman was holding his infant daughter when he was accosted by\napproximately eight gunmen, each of whom pointed their weapons at him and his child.\nWhen he told the men there was no money in the house, one of them grabbed the baby\nout of his hands and another hit him in the back of the head with what he believed was a\ngun. After he fell to the ground, they punched and kicked him for an extended period of\ntime. He was then moved to another room, tied up, and left there with his daughter and\none of the robbers while the rest of the people ransacked his house.\n       Later, as he was lying tied up on the ground, the robbers reconvened and he heard\none of them say, “Let’s smoke this guy.” Fearing for his life, Mr. Guzman requested that\nhis daughter be taken into another room so she would not see him get shot.

[S]ection [654] cannot, and should not, be\nstretched to cover gratuitous violence or other criminal acts far beyond those reasonably\nnecessary to accomplish the original offense.” (Id. at p. 191.) The evidence supporting\nCounts 13 and 14 permits the finding of separate intents and objectives despite the related\ncourse of conduct. We therefore reject all section 654 arguments as to those offenses.\nRobbery and Vehicle Theft\n       In each of the robberies that occurred in Counts 5, 11, and 16, a vehicle was stolen\nfrom the victims’ home. The vehicles were later found abandoned at nearby locations.\n\n                                                68.\n\fAppellants were convicted of vehicle theft within the meaning of Vehicle Code section\n10851, subdivision (a) on Counts 8 (Rivas only), 15, and 18.

(Id. at p. 372.) The California Supreme Court held that section 654 precluded\nseparate punishment for the vehicle theft conviction under the circumstances of the case.\nThe decision was based on the general principle that “where a defendant robs his victim\nin one continuous transaction of several items of property, punishment for robbery on the\nbasis of the taking of one of the items and other crimes on the basis of the taking of the\nother items is not permissible.” (Id. at p. 377.)\n       After reviewing the record, we are unable to distinguish this case from Bauer in\nany material respect. Appellants are therefore entitled to have their sentences on Counts\n8, 15, and 18 stayed. We remand for resentencing on these counts with instructions that\nthe trial court comply with section 654.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgments are affirmed in part and reversed in part. As to Rivas, the\njudgment is modified to reflect a conviction under Count 4 of the lesser included offense\nof attempting to prevent a victim or witness from reporting a crime in violation of section\n136.1, subdivision (b)(1). As to Centeno, Leon, Palofox, and Rivas, the judgments are\nmodified to reflect convictions under Count 13 of the lesser included offense of assault\nwith a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2).

Centeno shall be resentenced for these\ncounts on remand in a manner consistent with this opinion. As to Leon, the sentences\nimposed for Counts 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, and 18 are reversed subject to the conditions set\nforth herein.

Palofox shall be\nresentenced for these counts on remand in a manner consistent with this opinion.
