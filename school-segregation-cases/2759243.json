(<span><span>A</span></span>Guitar\r\nL.P.<span><span>@</span></span>)\r\ncontends the District exceeded its statutory authority under Chapter 36 when it\r\nadopted new rules for transfer permits that discriminate against\r\nsimilarly-situated landowners and rules for production permits that limit\r\nproduction based on a specific historic use period.<span>  </span>Guitar L.P. also complains that the District<span><span>=</span></span>s new transfer rules violate its equal\r\nprotection rights under the United\r\n  States and Texas Constitutions.<span>  </span>In addition, Guitar L.P. claims that the\r\nDistrict violated its vested rights by considering its permit applications\r\nunder the new rules, rather than the old rules that were in effect when Guitar\r\nL.P. initially filed its applications, an action that it asserts is contrary to\r\nthe Vested Rights Statute in Section 245.002 of the Texas Local Government Code.\r\n<span> </span>In a limited cross-appeal, the District\r\nchallenges the trial court<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ndenial of its attorney and expert fees, as well as the costs incurred in\r\npreparing the administrative record, and the court<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nruling in favor of Guitar L.P. on Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nclaim for a refund of administrative fees.<span> \r\n</span>The District also argues that the trial court erred in apportioning\r\npartial court costs against the District. <span> </span>We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in\r\npart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>FACTUAL\r\nAND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Bone\r\nSpring-Victorio Peak Aquifer (the <span><span>A</span></span>BS-VP\r\nAquifer<span><span>@</span></span> or <span><span>A</span></span>the Aquifer<span><span>@</span></span>)\r\nproduces groundwater for a region in west Texas\r\ncommonly referred to as the Dell Valley located in northeast Hudspeth County.<span>  </span>Prior to 1947, the Dell Valley\r\narea was primarily the site of cattle ranching.<span> \r\n</span>However, in the years that followed, an intense irrigated agricultural\r\nindustry developed in the region, which led to a marked increase in the use of\r\nits groundwater for irrigation purposes.<span> \r\n</span>In the mid-1950s, the <address>Hudspeth\r\n  County Commissioners Court</address>, by a petition followed\r\nby a confirmation election, created the District to conserve and protect the\r\nBS-VP Aquifer.<span>  </span>Irrigation pumpage in the\r\nDell Valley area peaked in the late 1970s,\r\nduring which time pumpage exceeded recharge, resulting in a decline in the\r\nwater table elevation for the BS-VP Aquifer.<span> \r\n</span>During the 1980s, irrigation pumpage diminished somewhat and water\r\nlevels remained relatively constant, however, by the mid-1990s, water levels\r\nonce again faced a downward trend.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section3\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1990, the\r\nDistrict enacted Rules (<span><span>A</span></span>the\r\n1990 Rules<span><span>@</span></span> or <span><span>A</span></span>old Rules<span><span>@</span></span>),\r\nwhich established a permitting system for drilling, equipping, or altering the\r\nsize of a well and a certification process for validating existing wells within\r\nthe district.<span>  </span>Under the 1990 Rules, the\r\nallowable rate for each water well within the district was limited to five\r\nacre-feet of water per year, regardless of the proposed use of the water.<span>  </span>However, the 1990 Rules placed stringent\r\nrestrictions on the transport of groundwater for use outside the district.<span>  </span>In 1998, the Board of the District adopted\r\nits groundwater management plan pursuant to Chapter 36 of the Texas Water\r\nCode.<span>  </span>The State Auditor<span><span>=</span></span>s Office audited the District<span><span>=</span></span>s implementation of its certified\r\ngroundwater management plan in 2000 and determined that the District had failed\r\nto meet its plan objectives and thus, was <span><span>A</span></span>not\r\noperational<span><span>@</span></span> and in\r\nviolation of the provisions of the Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By March 2002, the\r\nDistrict had developed a new management plan, which was later certified by the\r\nTexas Water Development Board.<span>  </span>According\r\nto the 2002 management plan, the best available information suggests that\r\n63,000 acre-feet per year is the long-term average amount of groundwater\r\navailable for consumptive use or transfer from the District from the BS-VP\r\nAquifer.<span>  </span>Effective May 31, 2002, the\r\nDistrict repealed its 1990 Rules and adopted new rules (the <span><span>A</span></span>2002 Rules<span><span>@</span></span>)\r\nregarding groundwater regulation within the district, which are now the subject\r\nof this appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section4\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s history in the region began in 1924\r\nwhen John Guitar, Sr. purchased over 52,000 acres of land in the Dell Valley.<span>  </span>Between the 1940s and 1960s, many parts of\r\nthe Guitar family<span><span>=</span></span>s land\r\nwas irrigated, but since that time period, the land has been used primarily for\r\ncattle ranching.<span>  </span>In 2002, Guitar L.P.\r\nwas formed to manage the property, which today consists of approximately 38,296\r\nacres, situated within the boundaries of the district.<span>  </span>There are fifteen existing groundwater wells\r\non the property, nine of which Guitar L.P. asserts have been used for\r\nirrigation purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On May 14, 2002,\r\nGuitar L.P. filed an application for validation certificates for the fifteen\r\nexisting wells, an application for fifty-two new water well drilling permits,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span>\r\nand an application for a permit to transfer water.<span>  </span>Despite Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nrequests, the District processed its validation and transport permits under the\r\n2002 Rules, not the 1990 Rules.<span>  </span>After an\r\nevidentiary hearing, the District issued validation and transport permits to\r\nGuitar L.P., which, based on the production limits established under the 2002 Rules\r\nthat<i> inter alia </i>designate an existing and historic use period, resulted\r\nin issuance of a validation permit for 57.96 irrigated acres, authorizing\r\nannual production of between 174 and 232 acre-feet of water depending on the\r\nlevel of the BS-VP Aquifer.<span>  </span>The District\r\nalso issued a transport permit authorizing Guitar L.P. to transport its water\r\nheld under the validation permit out of the district.<span>  </span>Appellees Cimarron Agricultural Ltd. (<span><span>A</span></span>Cimarron<span><span>@</span></span>),\r\nCL Machinery Company (<span><span>A</span></span>CLM<span><span>@</span></span>), the Rascoes, Robert L. Carpenter,\r\nGail Carpenter, and Triple B. Farms had also applied for validation and\r\ntransport permits, however, their permitted amounts of water production and its\r\nsubsequent transport were significantly greater than Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s permits despite Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s much larger property holdings within\r\nthe district.<span>  </span>This was due to Appellees\r\nprior use of groundwater during the designated existing and historic use period\r\nunder the 2002 Rules.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section5\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In four separate\r\nadministrative appeals to the 205th Judicial District Court of Hudspeth County,\r\nGuitar L.P. challenged the facial validity of the District<span><span>=</span></span>s adoption of new rules regarding\r\nproduction and transfer permits, raised an as-applied challenge to the validity\r\nof groundwater permits the District issued to <i>inter alia </i>Appellees\r\nCimarron and CLM, and appealed the District<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nadverse actions on its own permit applications.<span> \r\n</span>[<i>Guitar I</i>, <i>Guitar II</i>, and <i>Guitar III</i>].<span>  </span>In the fourth administrative appeal, Guitar\r\nL.P. also raised an as-applied challenge to the validity of the groundwater\r\npermits issued to Robert L.

class=\"Section19\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In essence, Guitar\r\nL.P. argues that because no landowner had ever transferred water outside the\r\nDistrict at the time the 2002 Rules were adopted, all of the transfer permit\r\napplications the District considered were <span><span>A</span></span>subsequent\r\nnew permit applications<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nfor the purposes of Section 36.113(e)(1) and therefore, the District<span><span>=</span></span>s rules which link a non-EHIL landowner<span><span>=</span></span>s groundwater allocation for transfer\r\npurposes to the amount allowable by his underlying validation or operating\r\npermit (which is substantially less than the allocation awarded to EHIL\r\nfarmers), constitutes a more restrictive transfer permit condition that is not\r\napplied to EHIL farmers<span><span>=</span></span>\r\ntransfer permit applications.<span>  </span>Guitar\r\nL.P. contends that District<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ntransfer

conclude,\r\nhowever, that Section 36.113(e) is not applicable in this case.<span>  </span>When read in the context of the other\r\nprovisions within Section 36.113, it is readily apparent that Subsection (e)\r\nmerely functions as a protective measure, by which the Legislature has granted\r\ngroundwater districts express authority to alter its permitting systems to\r\nimpose <span><span>A</span></span>more,<span><span>@</span></span> that is, additional, restrictive\r\npermit conditions on <i>new</i> permit applications and increased use by\r\nhistoric users, subject to certain qualifications listed in Subsection\r\n(e)(1)-(3) if future circumstances arise that warrant adjustments.<span>  </span>We must agree with the District that this\r\nstatutory provision serves as a safety valve for groundwater districts, in that\r\nit authorizes a district in later phases of groundwater regulation to <span><span>A</span></span>step up<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nits regulatory efforts in order to conserve and protect its groundwater\r\nresources.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span

underlying validation or\r\noperating permit, which presumably is a permit that offers EHIL-like water\r\nallocation, is a <span><span>A</span></span>restrictive\r\npermit condition<span><span>@</span></span> for\r\nnon-EHIL transfer permit applicants, we find that Section 36.113(e) does not\r\ncome into play until a district decides to require more, and perhaps tighter,\r\nrestrictions within its permitting system to new applicants or to historic\r\nusers who seek to increase their use.<span>  </span>We\r\nfind it of little import that as Guitar L.P. asserts in this case, no landowner\r\nhad ever transferred water outside the district.<span>  </span>We decide that this fact, standing alone,\r\nsimply does not make all transfer permit applications <span><span>A</span></span>subsequent\r\nnew permit applications<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nunder the District<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nexisting permitting system.<span>  </span>We

scheme for local\r\ngroundwater development and conservation.<span> \r\n</span>Given this conclusion, we need not reach Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s specific arguments regarding

on its claim for a partial refund of\r\nadministrative fees; and in assessing 25 percent of the court costs\r\nagainst the District.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The District\r\nargues that the

statutory\r\nconstruction, Section 36.066(g) does not apply to suits, such as this case,\r\nwhich are, in effect, administrative appeals.<span> \r\n</span>In so arguing, Guitar L.P. points to Section 36.102(d), which provides\r\nfor attorney fees in any suit to enforce its rules and argues that if the\r\nDistrict is correct, the mandatory award under Section 36.102(d) is mere\r\nstatutory

36.066(g) applies.<span>  </span>According to Guitar L.P., Section 36.066(g)\r\nis limited to the types of suits mentioned within Section 36.066, not judicial\r\nchallenges to the rules or appeals of administrative rule-making and\r\nadjudicatory decisions, as Guitar L.P. describes this case.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section31\">\r\n\r\n<p

other costs.<span>  </span>Moreover, nothing in the provision excludes\r\nthe suits described in Section 35.251.<span> \r\n</span>This construction of Section 36.066(g) is not inconsistent with other\r\nprovisions in Chapter 36, including Section 36.102(d).<span>  </span>Indeed, Section 36.102(d) merely clarifies\r\nthat the District may recover these costs in the enforcement proceedings\r\ndescribed in Section 36.102.<span>  </span>Further, as\r\nthe District rightly points out, it would not be a redundant provision in all\r\ncases, for example, a district may voluntarily intervene in another action,\r\nlike a citizen<span><span>=</span></span>s suit\r\nunder Section 36.119 for the purpose of enforcing its rules.<span>  </span>Under that circumstance, voluntarily\r\nintervening in a suit would preclude attorney<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nfees under Section 36.066(g), but such fees would be recoverable under Section\r\n36.102(d).<span>

District<span><span>=</span></span>s fee assessments against it.<span>  </span>In reply, Guitar L.P. asserts that even if\r\nSection 36.066(g) applies, the District did not wholly prevail in all of the\r\nappeals, arguing that because Section 36.066(g) does not contain any language\r\nthat would allow the District to recover its attorney fees in a case where it <span><span>A</span></span>substantially prevails<span><span>@</span></span> or <span><span>A</span></span>prevails\r\non any disputed issue,<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nthen it may only recover

expert consultant fees\r\nagainst Guitar L.P.<span>  </span>Guitar L.P. argues\r\nthat it was overcharged $1,358.73 ($450 and $908.73) for the attorney fees the\r\nDistrict incurred for attorney Renea Hicks.<span> \r\n</span>The record shows that the District had agreed at the administrative\r\nlevel that Guitar L.P. was overcharged $450 for Hicks<span><span>=</span></span>\r\nMay 2003 statement,

(<span><span>A</span></span>Guitar\r\nL.P.<span><span>@</span></span>)\r\ncontends the District exceeded its statutory authority under Chapter 36 when it\r\nadopted new rules for transfer permits that discriminate against\r\nsimilarly-situated landowners and rules for production permits that limit\r\nproduction based on a specific historic use period.<span>  </span>Guitar L.P. also complains that the District<span><span>=</span></span>s new transfer rules violate its equal\r\nprotection rights under the United\r\n  States and Texas Constitutions.<span>  </span>In addition, Guitar L.P. claims that the\r\nDistrict violated its vested rights by considering its permit applications\r\nunder the new rules, rather than the old rules that were in effect when Guitar\r\nL.P. initially filed its applications, an action that it asserts is contrary to\r\nthe Vested Rights Statute in Section 245.002 of the Texas Local Government Code.\r\n<span> </span>In a limited cross-appeal, the District\r\nchallenges the trial court<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ndenial of its attorney and expert fees, as well as the costs incurred in\r\npreparing the administrative record, and the court<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nruling in favor of Guitar L.P. on Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nclaim for a refund of administrative fees.<span> \r\n</span>The District also argues that the trial court erred in apportioning\r\npartial court costs against the District. <span> </span>We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in\r\npart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>FACTUAL\r\nAND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Bone\r\nSpring-Victorio Peak Aquifer (the <span><span>A</span></span>BS-VP\r\nAquifer<span><span>@</span></span> or <span><span>A</span></span>the Aquifer<span><span>@</span></span>)\r\nproduces groundwater for a region in west Texas\r\ncommonly referred to as the Dell Valley located in northeast Hudspeth County.<span>  </span>Prior to 1947, the Dell Valley\r\narea was primarily the site of cattle ranching.<span> \r\n</span>However, in the years that followed, an intense irrigated agricultural\r\nindustry developed in the region, which led to a marked increase in the use of\r\nits groundwater for irrigation purposes.<span> \r\n</span>In the mid-1950s, the <address>Hudspeth\r\n  County Commissioners Court</address>, by a petition followed\r\nby a confirmation election, created the District to conserve and protect the\r\nBS-VP Aquifer.<span>  </span>Irrigation pumpage in the\r\nDell Valley area peaked in the late 1970s,\r\nduring which time pumpage exceeded recharge, resulting in a decline in the\r\nwater table elevation for the BS-VP Aquifer.<span> \r\n</span>During the 1980s, irrigation pumpage diminished somewhat and water\r\nlevels remained relatively constant, however, by the mid-1990s, water levels\r\nonce again faced a downward trend.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section3\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1990, the\r\nDistrict enacted Rules (<span><span>A</span></span>the\r\n1990 Rules<span><span>@</span></span> or <span><span>A</span></span>old Rules<span><span>@</span></span>),\r\nwhich established a permitting system for drilling, equipping, or altering the\r\nsize of a well and a certification process for validating existing wells within\r\nthe district.<span>  </span>Under the 1990 Rules, the\r\nallowable rate for each water well within the district was limited to five\r\nacre-feet of water per year, regardless of the proposed use of the water.<span>  </span>However, the 1990 Rules placed stringent\r\nrestrictions on the transport of groundwater for use outside the district.<span>  </span>In 1998, the Board of the District adopted\r\nits groundwater management plan pursuant to Chapter 36 of the Texas Water\r\nCode.<span>  </span>The State Auditor<span><span>=</span></span>s Office audited the District<span><span>=</span></span>s implementation of its certified\r\ngroundwater management plan in 2000 and determined that the District had failed\r\nto meet its plan objectives and thus, was <span><span>A</span></span>not\r\noperational<span><span>@</span></span> and in\r\nviolation of the provisions of the Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By March 2002, the\r\nDistrict had developed a new management plan, which was later certified by the\r\nTexas Water Development Board.<span>  </span>According\r\nto the 2002 management plan, the best available information suggests that\r\n63,000 acre-feet per year is the long-term average amount of groundwater\r\navailable for consumptive use or transfer from the District from the BS-VP\r\nAquifer.<span>  </span>Effective May 31, 2002, the\r\nDistrict repealed its 1990 Rules and adopted new rules (the <span><span>A</span></span>2002 Rules<span><span>@</span></span>)\r\nregarding groundwater regulation within the district, which are now the subject\r\nof this appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section4\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s history in the region began in 1924\r\nwhen John Guitar, Sr. purchased over 52,000 acres of land in the Dell Valley.<span>  </span>Between the 1940s and 1960s, many parts of\r\nthe Guitar family<span><span>=</span></span>s land\r\nwas irrigated, but since that time period, the land has been used primarily for\r\ncattle ranching.<span>  </span>In 2002, Guitar L.P.\r\nwas formed to manage the property, which today consists of approximately 38,296\r\nacres, situated within the boundaries of the district.<span>  </span>There are fifteen existing groundwater wells\r\non the property, nine of which Guitar L.P. asserts have been used for\r\nirrigation purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On May 14, 2002,\r\nGuitar L.P. filed an application for validation certificates for the fifteen\r\nexisting wells, an application for fifty-two new water well drilling permits,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span>\r\nand an application for a permit to transfer water.<span>  </span>Despite Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nrequests, the District processed its validation and transport permits under the\r\n2002 Rules, not the 1990 Rules.<span>  </span>After an\r\nevidentiary hearing, the District issued validation and transport permits to\r\nGuitar L.P., which, based on the production limits established under the 2002 Rules\r\nthat<i> inter alia </i>designate an existing and historic use period, resulted\r\nin issuance of a validation permit for 57.96 irrigated acres, authorizing\r\nannual production of between 174 and 232 acre-feet of water depending on the\r\nlevel of the BS-VP Aquifer.<span>  </span>The District\r\nalso issued a transport permit authorizing Guitar L.P. to transport its water\r\nheld under the validation permit out of the district.<span>  </span>Appellees Cimarron Agricultural Ltd. (<span><span>A</span></span>Cimarron<span><span>@</span></span>),\r\nCL Machinery Company (<span><span>A</span></span>CLM<span><span>@</span></span>), the Rascoes, Robert L. Carpenter,\r\nGail Carpenter, and Triple B. Farms had also applied for validation and\r\ntransport permits, however, their permitted amounts of water production and its\r\nsubsequent transport were significantly greater than Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s permits despite Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s much larger property holdings within\r\nthe district.<span>  </span>This was due to Appellees\r\nprior use of groundwater during the designated existing and historic use period\r\nunder the 2002 Rules.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section5\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In four separate\r\nadministrative appeals to the 205th Judicial District Court of Hudspeth County,\r\nGuitar L.P. challenged the facial validity of the District<span><span>=</span></span>s adoption of new rules regarding\r\nproduction and transfer permits, raised an as-applied challenge to the validity\r\nof groundwater permits the District issued to <i>inter alia </i>Appellees\r\nCimarron and CLM, and appealed the District<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nadverse actions on its own permit applications.<span> \r\n</span>[<i>Guitar I</i>, <i>Guitar II</i>, and <i>Guitar III</i>].<span>  </span>In the fourth administrative appeal, Guitar\r\nL.P. also raised an as-applied challenge to the validity of the groundwater\r\npermits issued to Robert L.

class=\"Section19\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In essence, Guitar\r\nL.P. argues that because no landowner had ever transferred water outside the\r\nDistrict at the time the 2002 Rules were adopted, all of the transfer permit\r\napplications the District considered were <span><span>A</span></span>subsequent\r\nnew permit applications<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nfor the purposes of Section 36.113(e)(1) and therefore, the District<span><span>=</span></span>s rules which link a non-EHIL landowner<span><span>=</span></span>s groundwater allocation for transfer\r\npurposes to the amount allowable by his underlying validation or operating\r\npermit (which is substantially less than the allocation awarded to EHIL\r\nfarmers), constitutes a more restrictive transfer permit condition that is not\r\napplied to EHIL farmers<span><span>=</span></span>\r\ntransfer permit applications.<span>  </span>Guitar\r\nL.P. contends that District<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ntransfer rules are thus impermissible under Section 36.113(e).</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section20\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We conclude,\r\nhowever, that Section 36.113(e) is not applicable in this case.<span>  </span>When read in the context of the other\r\nprovisions within Section 36.113, it is readily apparent that Subsection (e)\r\nmerely functions as a protective measure, by which the Legislature has granted\r\ngroundwater districts express authority to alter its permitting systems to\r\nimpose <span><span>A</span></span>more,<span><span>@</span></span> that is, additional, restrictive\r\npermit conditions on <i>new</i> permit applications and increased use by\r\nhistoric users, subject to certain qualifications listed in Subsection\r\n(e)(1)-(3) if future circumstances arise that warrant adjustments.<span>  </span>We must agree with the District that this\r\nstatutory provision serves as a safety valve for groundwater districts, in that\r\nit authorizes a district in later phases of groundwater regulation to <span><span>A</span></span>step up<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nits regulatory efforts in order to conserve and protect its groundwater\r\nresources.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>Therefore, assuming, without deciding that\r\nhaving to satisfy the criteria for issuance of an underlying validation or\r\noperating permit, which presumably is a permit that offers EHIL-like water\r\nallocation, is a <span><span>A</span></span>restrictive\r\npermit condition<span><span>@</span></span> for\r\nnon-EHIL transfer permit applicants, we find that Section 36.113(e) does not\r\ncome into play until a district decides to require more, and perhaps tighter,\r\nrestrictions within its permitting system to new applicants or to historic\r\nusers who seek to increase their use.<span>  </span>We\r\nfind it of little import that as Guitar L.P. asserts in this case, no landowner\r\nhad ever transferred water outside the district.<span>  </span>We decide that this fact, standing alone,\r\nsimply does not make all transfer permit applications <span><span>A</span></span>subsequent\r\nnew permit applications<span><span>@</span></span>\r\nunder the District<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nexisting permitting system.<span>  </span>We agree\r\nwith the District that Section 36.113(e) does not address front-end\r\ndistinctions between the types of permits issued under the District<span><span>=</span></span>s current regulatory scheme for local\r\ngroundwater development and conservation.<span> \r\n</span>Given this conclusion, we need not reach Guitar L.P.<span><span>=</span></span>s specific arguments regarding

36.102(d), which provides\r\nfor attorney fees in any suit to enforce its rules and argues that if the\r\nDistrict is correct, the mandatory award under Section 36.102(d) is mere\r\nstatutory

expert consultant fees\r\nagainst Guitar L.P.<span>  </span>Guitar L.P. argues\r\nthat it was overcharged $1,358.73 ($450 and $908.73) for the attorney fees the\r\nDistrict incurred for attorney Renea
