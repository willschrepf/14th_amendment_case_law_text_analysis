The United States District Court for the\n                                   2\nWestern District of Missouri           certified a class of present and future\nMissouri death-row inmates.      The parties soon negotiated a detailed consent\ndecree regulating a number of aspects of day-to-day life on death row, and\nthe court approved the decree, following several addenda, in January 1987.\nWe first saw this case in 1988, when we affirmed the court’s award of\nattorney fees to counsel for the plaintiffs.           See McDonald v. Armontrout,\n860 F.2d 1456 (8th Cir. 1988).\n\n\n      The following year, the defendants filed motions to move death row\nto the newly constructed Potosi Correctional Center and to modify the\nconsent decree to reflect the different conditions at the new prison.               The\ncourt granted both motions.      On the plaintiffs’ appeal of the modification\nof the consent decree, we\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable John B. Jones, United States District Judge\nfor the District of South Dakota, sitting by designation.\n      2\n      The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge\nfor the Western District of Missouri.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fagain affirmed.    See McDonald v. Armontrout, 908 F.2d 388 (8th Cir. 1990)\n(McDonald II).    Because the Potosi prison is beyond the boundaries of the\nWestern District of Missouri, the modified decree provided for a transfer\nof jurisdiction to the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\n\n     Not long after their arrival in Potosi, the plaintiffs moved the\nDistrict Court3 to hold the defendants in contempt, challenging specific\nconditions of their confinement in the new prison.              Before the court acted\non that motion, the defendants “mainstreamed” the plaintiff class into the\ngeneral prisoner population.      (As a result, a true “death row” no longer\nexists in Missouri, but we will continue to use that term as a form of\nshorthand.)   The court denied the contempt motion.\n\n\n     The defendants filed a motion in 1991 to dismiss this case, which the\nDistrict Court interpreted as a motion to vacate the consent decree and\nterminate   its   continuing   jurisdiction.        The    court       received   written\nsubmissions   from    the   plaintiffs,    conducted      six    days    of   evidentiary\nhearings, and considered further materials submitted by both sides.\nFinally, in September 1995, the District Court filed an exhaustive eighty-\nfive-page   opinion    vacating   the     consent   decree       and    terminating   its\njurisdiction.     The plaintiffs appeal, and we affirm.\n\n\n     At the outset, we consider the effect on this action of a section of\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3626 (West Supp. 1997),\nwhich imposes restrictions on the duration of prospective relief in actions\nchallenging prison conditions.     See id. § 3626(b).           The Act took effect on\nApril 26, 1996, after the\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Honorable Edward L. Filippine, United States District\nJudge for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDistrict Court rendered its order dismissing this case, and so the District\nCourt did not have an opportunity to consider whether the Act should apply\nto this case.   The plaintiffs, who filed their opening brief in this appeal\nshortly after the Act became law, did not address the new law and have not\nfiled a reply brief.   The state’s brief argues in conclusory fashion that\nthe Act applies and that the dismissal of the case was proper.   Because the\nparties and the record have given us little to work with on this issue, we\nwill apply the law prevailing when the District Court filed its opinion and\nleave the Act for another day.4\n\n\n     We review the District Court’s decision to terminate its supervision\nover the consent decree for abuse of discretion.     See Heath v. DeCourcy,\n992 F.2d 630, 633 (6th Cir. 1993); see also McDonald II, 908 F.2d at 390\n(applying same standard to modification of terms of decree).     In deciding\nwhether to terminate its jurisdiction, a district court should consider\nseveral factors:\n\n\n     (1) any specific terms providing for continued supervision and\n     jurisdiction over the consent decree; (2) the consent decree’s\n     underlying goals; (3) whether there has been compliance with\n     prior court orders; (4) whether defendants made a good faith\n     effort to comply; (5) the length of time the consent decree has\n     been in effect; and\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We recognize that other prisoners, including some within\nour Circuit, have raised constitutional challenges to the\nvalidity of the Act. See, e.g., Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365,\n371-75 (4th Cir. 1996) (rejecting a number of constitutional\nchallenges); Gavin v. Ray, No. 4-78-CV-70062, 1996 WL 622556, at\n*2-4 (S.D. Iowa Sept. 18, 1996) (holding § 3626(b)(2)\nunconstitutional); Lyon v. Vande Krol, 940 F. Supp. 1433, 1436-39\n(S.D. Iowa 1996) (holding 28 U.S.C.A. § 1915(g), also added by\nthe Act but concerning in forma pauperis proceedings,\nunconstitutional). The district judges who decided Gavin and\nLyon have certified these cases for interlocutory appeal pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). In this case, we need not and do not\nreach any issues concerning the constitutionality of the Act.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f      (6) the continuing         efficacy     of   the   consent     decree’s\n      enforcement.\n\nHeath, 992 F.2d at 633; see also Board of Educ. of Okla. City Pub. Sch.,\nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 89 v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249 (1991) (noting that,\nin considering whether to lift desegregation decree, court should consider\npast compliance with court orders and defendant’s good faith); Johnson v.\nHeffron, 88 F.3d 404, 407 (6th Cir. 1996) (ordering prison consent decree\ndissolved where its goals had been achieved and no constitutional violation\nwas likely after dissolution); Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rufo, 12\nF.3d 286, 293 (1st Cir. 1993) (suggesting that court should consider\nwhether    constitutional   violation   has   been   remedied,     defendants   have\ncomplied with decree in good faith for reasonable period, and violation is\nunlikely to be repeated if decree is terminated) (dicta); Kindred v.\nDuckworth, 9 F.3d 638, 644 (7th Cir. 1993) (“[D]ecrees imposing obligations\nupon state institutions normally should be enforceable no longer than the\nneed for them.”).\n\n\n      We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when\nit dissolved the decree in the case at bar.          We begin with the goals and\nterms of the consent decree.     In McDonald II, we identified the purpose of\nthe decree at issue here as “to provide constitutionally acceptable\nconditions of confinement for inmates on death row.         The decree is simply\na   plan   for ensuring that the capital punishment unit complies with\nconstitutional requirements.”     McDonald II, 908 F.2d at 391.        As modified\nin 1989, the decree itself provides that jurisdiction is transferred to the\nEastern District “to insure compliance with the foregoing provisions until\nsuch time as all provisions of this decree have been fully implemented.”\nModified Decree ¶ 20.5      It follows that\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      The plaintiffs do not challenge the District Court’s\nconclusion that the only provisions of the decree presently in\neffect are those provisions set forth in Judge Wright’s May 10,\n1989 order modifying the decree in connection with the move to\nPotosi.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fonce the decree had accomplished its purpose, remedying any conditions of\ndeath row that may have fallen short of constitutional standards, the\nDistrict Court properly could vacate it and bring this case to a close.\n\n\n     We next consider whether the state complied or attempted in good\nfaith to comply with court orders (namely, the terms of the decree).    The\nsubstantive terms of the decree address the conditions of life on death row\nin some detail, but the decree does not provide the plaintiffs with all the\nprivileges they claim.   In particular, the following concerns raised by the\nplaintiffs in their objections to the District Court’s dismissal of the\ncase, although related to general topics covered in the decree, bear no\nreal connection to the actual terms of the decree:       (1) the number of\ntelephones, the lack of tables near telephones, and the requirement that\nadministrative segregation inmates be handcuffed during calls; (2) the\nmanner in which G.E.D. programs are provided; and (3) the presence of light\nearly in the morning and the absence of light late at night.   See Modified\nDecree ¶¶ 4, 12, 13.     Accordingly, these objections add nothing to the\nplaintiffs’ argument that the District Court abused its discretion in\nvacating the decree.6\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Similarly, the prisoners’ argument that the District Court\nshould have reopened the evidentiary hearings in light of new\ndevelopments (an increase in the population of the prison and a\nprison-wide lockdown in August 1995) is meritless. The District\nCourt correctly determined that none of these developments, and\nnone of the prisoners’ grievances attendant thereto, was relevant\nto the consent decree.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f        In two areas, the District Court did find that the defendants may\nhave violated the strict terms of the decree.             One provision of the decree\nrequires the defendants to take reasonable care to avoid the “scattering\nof legal materials” during cell searches.                Modified Decree ¶ 2(b).        The\nDistrict Court found some evidence that prisoners’ legal materials have\nbeen scattered during searches, but found that any scattering was not done\nin bad faith.     (This is not quite the same as finding that the defendants\ntook reasonable care to avoid scattering the materials, as the decree\nrequires.)      But the court also found that any scattering that occurred was\nnot for any improper purpose, was not retaliatory in nature, and did not\nactually interfere with the plaintiffs’ access to the courts.                   See Scher\nv. Engelke, 943 F.2d 921, 924 (8th Cir. 1991) (retaliation), cert. denied,\n503 U.S. 952 (1992); Lewis v. Casey, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2180 (1996) (access\nto courts).     The plaintiffs’ only objection to dismissal on this issue is\ntheir    bare    assertion   that   legal    materials      have,   on   occasion,     been\nscattered.      Without more--such as a pattern or practice of intentional\nscattering or an actual constitutional violation--we cannot conclude that\nthe District Court abused its discretion by vacating the decree over this\nobjection.\n\n\n        The   District   Court   also   noted     some    shortfalls     in   the   state’s\ncompliance with the decree’s provisions relating to medical services.                   The\ndecree requires that inmates be permitted to visit the eye clinic within\neight working days of making a request and that medication be dispensed\nwithin twenty-four hours of prescription.           See Modified Decree ¶ 5(d)-(e).\nThe court noted that prisoners now have, at most, a two- to four-week delay\nin seeing an optometrist and a five-day delay in receiving prescription\nmedication.     The court concluded that these delays were not caused by bad\nfaith on the part of the defendants, but rather by shift changes, the\noptometrist’s limited hours, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\flack of a pharmacy on the prison premises.        Furthermore, the court\nconcluded that any delays in no way constituted deliberate indifference to\nthe prisoners’ medical needs and thus posed no constitutional problems.\nSee, e.g., Givens v. Jones, 900 F.2d 1229, 1233 (8th Cir. 1990) (granting\njudgment to defendants in action alleging one-month delay in treatment of\nnon-acute condition).   In light of the defendants’ good-faith efforts to\ncomply with this section of the decree and the lack of any constitutional\ndifficulties presented by the delays, we cannot conclude that the District\nCourt abused its discretion in vacating the decree over this objection.\n\n\n     After determining that the defendants had complied with the other\nterms of the consent decree, the District Court considered whether the\nstate was likely to impose unconstitutional conditions on the prisoners if\nthe decree were vacated.   The court found no reason to believe that would\nhappen, and the plaintiffs have suggested none to us.   We hardly need to\nadd that the prisoners may challenge, by means of a separate lawsuit, any\nunconstitutional situation that may arise in the future.\n\n\n     After more than ten years of litigation, the District Court concluded\nthat the consent decree in this case should be vacated and the case\ndismissed.   In light of the deference we owe to that decision, see Heath,\n992 F.2d at 633, and to the day-to-day judgments of the defendants in the\noperation of the prison, see Lewis, 116 S. Ct. at 2185, we cannot say that\nthe order of the District Court dismissing the case is an abuse of that\ncourt’s discretion.\n\n\n     The order of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fA true copy.\n\n\n     Attest:\n\n\n           CLERK, U.

The United States District Court for the\n                                   2\nWestern District of Missouri           certified a class of present and future\nMissouri death-row inmates.      The parties soon negotiated a detailed consent\ndecree regulating a number of aspects of day-to-day life on death row, and\nthe court approved the decree, following several addenda, in January 1987.\nWe first saw this case in 1988, when we affirmed the court’s award of\nattorney fees to counsel for the plaintiffs.

Because the Potosi prison is beyond the boundaries of the\nWestern District of Missouri, the modified decree provided for a transfer\nof jurisdiction to the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\n\n     Not long after their arrival in Potosi, the plaintiffs moved the\nDistrict Court3 to hold the defendants in contempt, challenging specific\nconditions of their confinement in the new prison.              Before the court acted\non that motion, the defendants “mainstreamed” the plaintiff class into the\ngeneral prisoner population.      (As a result, a true “death row” no longer\nexists in Missouri, but we will continue to use that term as a form of\nshorthand.)   The court denied the contempt motion.\n\n\n     The defendants filed a motion in 1991 to dismiss this case, which the\nDistrict Court interpreted as a motion to vacate the consent decree and\nterminate   its   continuing   jurisdiction.        The    court       received   written\nsubmissions   from    the   plaintiffs,    conducted      six    days    of   evidentiary\nhearings, and considered further materials submitted by both sides.\nFinally, in September 1995, the District Court filed an exhaustive eighty-\nfive-page   opinion    vacating   the     consent   decree       and    terminating   its\njurisdiction.     The plaintiffs appeal, and we affirm.\n\n\n     At the outset, we consider the effect on this action of a section of\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3626 (West Supp. 1997),\nwhich imposes restrictions on the duration of prospective relief in actions\nchallenging prison conditions.     See id. § 3626(b).           The Act took effect on\nApril 26, 1996, after the\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Honorable Edward L. Filippine, United States District\nJudge for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDistrict Court rendered its order dismissing this case, and so the District\nCourt did not have an opportunity to consider whether the Act should apply\nto this case.   The plaintiffs, who filed their opening brief in this appeal\nshortly after the Act became law, did not address the new law and have not\nfiled a reply brief.   The state’s brief argues in conclusory fashion that\nthe Act applies and that the dismissal of the case was proper.   Because the\nparties and the record have given us little to work with on this issue, we\nwill apply the law prevailing when the District Court filed its opinion and\nleave the Act for another day.4\n\n\n     We review the District Court’s decision to terminate its supervision\nover the consent decree for abuse of discretion.

DeCourcy,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633 (6th Cir. 1993); see also McDonald II, 908 F.2d at 390\n(applying same standard to modification of terms of decree).     In deciding\nwhether to terminate its jurisdiction, a district court should consider\nseveral factors:\n\n\n     (1) any specific terms providing for continued supervision and\n     jurisdiction over the consent decree; (2) the consent decree’s\n     underlying goals; (3) whether there has been compliance with\n     prior court orders; (4) whether defendants made a good faith\n     effort to comply; (5) the length of time the consent decree has\n     been in effect; and\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We recognize that other prisoners, including some within\nour Circuit, have raised constitutional challenges to the\nvalidity of the Act.

We begin with the goals and\nterms of the consent decree.     In McDonald II, we identified the purpose of\nthe decree at issue here as “to provide constitutionally acceptable\nconditions of confinement for inmates on death row.         The decree is simply\na   plan   for ensuring that the capital punishment unit complies with\nconstitutional requirements.”     McDonald II, 908 F.2d at 391.        As modified\nin 1989, the decree itself provides that jurisdiction is transferred to the\nEastern District “to insure compliance with the foregoing provisions until\nsuch time as all provisions of this decree have been fully implemented.”\nModified Decree ¶ 20.5      It follows that\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      The plaintiffs do not challenge the District Court’s\nconclusion that the only provisions of the decree presently in\neffect are those provisions set forth in Judge Wright’s May 10,\n1989 order modifying the decree in connection with the move to\nPotosi.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fonce the decree had accomplished its purpose, remedying any conditions of\ndeath row that may have fallen short of constitutional standards, the\nDistrict Court properly could vacate it and bring this case to a close.\n\n\n     We next consider whether the state complied or attempted in good\nfaith to comply with court orders (namely, the terms of the decree).    The\nsubstantive terms of the decree address the conditions of life on death row\nin some detail, but the decree does not provide the plaintiffs with all the\nprivileges they claim.   In particular, the following concerns raised by the\nplaintiffs in their objections to the District Court’s dismissal of the\ncase, although related to general topics covered in the decree, bear no\nreal connection to the actual terms of the decree:       (1) the number of\ntelephones, the lack of tables near telephones, and the requirement that\nadministrative segregation inmates be handcuffed during calls; (2) the\nmanner in which G.E.D. programs are provided; and (3) the presence of light\nearly in the morning and the absence of light late at night.   See Modified\nDecree ¶¶ 4, 12, 13.     Accordingly, these objections add nothing to the\nplaintiffs’ argument that the District Court abused its discretion in\nvacating the decree.6\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Similarly, the prisoners’ argument that the District Court\nshould have reopened the evidentiary hearings in light of new\ndevelopments (an increase in the population of the prison and a\nprison-wide lockdown in August 1995) is meritless. The District\nCourt correctly determined that none of these developments, and\nnone of the prisoners’ grievances attendant thereto, was relevant\nto the consent decree.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f        In two areas, the District Court did find that the defendants may\nhave violated the strict terms of the decree.             One provision of the decree\nrequires the defendants to take reasonable care to avoid the “scattering\nof legal materials” during cell searches.                Modified Decree ¶ 2(b).        The\nDistrict Court found some evidence that prisoners’ legal materials have\nbeen scattered during searches, but found that any scattering was not done\nin bad faith.     (This is not quite the same as finding that the defendants\ntook reasonable care to avoid scattering the materials, as the decree\nrequires.)      But the court also found that any scattering that occurred was\nnot for any improper purpose, was not retaliatory in nature, and did not\nactually interfere with the plaintiffs’ access to the courts.

The plaintiffs’ only objection to dismissal on this issue is\ntheir    bare    assertion   that   legal    materials      have,   on   occasion,     been\nscattered.      Without more--such as a pattern or practice of intentional\nscattering or an actual constitutional violation--we cannot conclude that\nthe District Court abused its discretion by vacating the decree over this\nobjection.\n\n\n        The   District   Court   also   noted     some    shortfalls     in   the   state’s\ncompliance with the decree’s provisions relating to medical services.                   The\ndecree requires that inmates be permitted to visit the eye clinic within\neight working days of making a request and that medication be dispensed\nwithin twenty-four hours of prescription.           See Modified Decree ¶ 5(d)-(e).\nThe court noted that prisoners now have, at most, a two- to four-week delay\nin seeing an optometrist and a five-day delay in receiving prescription\nmedication.     The court concluded that these delays were not caused by bad\nfaith on the part of the defendants, but rather by shift changes, the\noptometrist’s limited hours, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\flack of a pharmacy on the prison premises.        Furthermore, the court\nconcluded that any delays in no way constituted deliberate indifference to\nthe prisoners’ medical needs and thus posed no constitutional problems.\nSee, e.g., Givens v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539906\"><a href=\"/opinion/539906/david-wayne-givens-v-jimmy-jones-terry-morris-zak-a-ajans-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1233 (8th Cir. 1990) (granting\njudgment to defendants in action alleging one-month delay in treatment of\nnon-acute condition).   In light of the defendants’ good-faith efforts to\ncomply with this section of the decree and the lack of any constitutional\ndifficulties presented by the delays, we cannot conclude that the District\nCourt abused its discretion in vacating the decree over this objection.\n\n\n     After determining that the defendants had complied with the other\nterms of the consent decree, the District Court considered whether the\nstate was likely to impose unconstitutional conditions on the prisoners if\nthe decree were vacated.   The court found no reason to believe that would\nhappen, and the plaintiffs have suggested none to us.   We hardly need to\nadd that the prisoners may challenge, by means of a separate lawsuit, any\nunconstitutional situation that may arise in the future.\n\n\n     After more than ten years of litigation, the District Court concluded\nthat the consent decree in this case should be vacated and the case\ndismissed.   In light of the deference we owe to that decision, see Heath,\n992 F.2d at 633, and to the day-to-day judgments of the defendants in the\noperation of the prison, see Lewis, 116 S. Ct. at 2185, we cannot say that\nthe order of the District Court dismissing the case is an abuse of that\ncourt’s discretion.\n\n\n     The order of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fA true copy.\n\n\n     Attest:\n\n\n           CLERK, U.
