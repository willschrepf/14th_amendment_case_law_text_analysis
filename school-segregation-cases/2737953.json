On October 31, 2000, the trial court found C.S.H. engaged\r\nin delinquent conduct under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 51.03(a)(1) (Vernon 2002) by committing\r\nburglary of a building, two misdemeanor theft offenses, and misdemeanor criminal mischief.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Pen. Code Ann. §§ 28.03(b)(2), 30.02(c)(1), 31.03(e)(2)(A)(I) (Vernon Supp. 2003).  The trial\r\ncourt adjudicated C.S.H. delinquent and placed him on two years' probation.  Among the\r\nrequirements of his probation, C.S.H. was ordered to \"commit no offense against the laws of this or\r\nany other State, or of the United States.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAbout a year later, the State moved to modify C.S.H.'s disposition, alleging he violated the\r\nrequirements of his probation by intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury to\r\nChristopher Levi Bevington by severely breaking his arm.  <em>See</em> Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 22.02(a)(1)\r\n(Vernon 1994) (aggravated assault).  After a hearing, the trial court found C.S.H. engaged in\r\ndelinquent conduct, modified his disposition, and committed him to TYC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. contends there is factually insufficient evidence that he intentionally or knowingly\r\ncaused serious bodily injury to Bevington.  At the hearing, Bevington testified as follows.  He and\r\nC.S.H. rode the same bus to and from school.  On the day of the alleged assault, he and C.S.H.\r\nbecame involved in a physical confrontation on the bus on the way home from school.  C.S.H.\r\nslapped Bevington on the cheek, and Bevington told him something to the effect of, \"I swear to all\r\nthe angels in heaven if you ever do that again I will . . . kick [your] ass.\"  C.S.H. then pinched him\r\nin the face, and the two began to scuffle. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBevington further testified that the bus driver ordered him to sit at the front of the bus and\r\nC.S.H. to sit in the middle.  C.S.H.'s stop was immediately before Bevington's, but the two stops\r\nwere separated by about one hundred feet.  Just before C.S.H.'s stop, Bevington obtained the bus\r\ndriver's permission to retrieve his bag, which was at the back of the bus.  As he walked past C.S.H.,\r\nhe heard C.S.H. say, \"We are going to finish this.\"  Other students asked him whether he was going\r\nto fight C.S.H., and he responded, \"If I have to I will go ahead and do it.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. exited the bus at his regular stop, but he immediately began walking toward\r\nBevington's stop.  Bevington exited the bus at his regular stop and walked about five or ten feet to\r\nmeet C.S.H.  The two faced each other, and C.S.H. told Bevington he was not going to do anything\r\nuntil the bus drove off.  Eventually, Bevington turned to walk away. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs he was walking away, C.S.H. \"grabbed [Bevington's] left arm and twisted it behind\r\n[Bevington's] back.\"  Bevington described the remainder of the altercation as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tWhy don't you stand up and show the judge how it happened?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tOkay.  He -- I will use the arm, he twisted it like that and back with\r\nhis other arm, he had his other arm up against my shoulder and like that he was going\r\nto try to push me back and he was trying to trip me and make me fall backward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAnd I was able to push forward where I would get loose from him and\r\nhis other arm got loose, was right across my shoulder and I was able to -- he had his\r\nother arm around behind me so I was trying to get behind him so I might be able to\r\nhold onto him and maybe calm him down with that spare arm I'm pretty sure that he\r\nwould hold my arm because there wasn't anything else that he could have kept it\r\nwith.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tDid he still have hold of your left arm at that time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tYes.  He still has my left arm twisted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tRight after that I heard a real loud crack sound and my arm throbbed\r\nin loss [sic] of pain.  I was pretty sure it was broken.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAfter that he just let my arm drop and just hang there.  It wasn't\r\nworking at all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tDid he say anything to you at that time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tYes.  Right afterward he said, \"How does that feel, bitch?\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tAfter that I was able to get behind him, my arm was still just dangling,\r\nI got one blow like into it but after that I tripped him and when he fell to the ground\r\nhe grabbed my shirt and pulled me with him and I landed on my right arm so I know\r\nI didn't break my arm when I landed on the ground.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAnd when we was [sic] on the ground he got up before I did and he\r\nput my other arm in a twist, too, like he was going to try to break it, my other arm,\r\njust twisted it like that, put it right toward his stomach area, I saw that his body was --\r\nI saw his head was right there and I thought I would take a chance and I kneed him\r\nin the face, after that he used his left arm and pulled me and hit me in the face and\r\nended up butting me and hit both of my wrists and made them pretty puffed up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Bevington sustained breaks to both bones in his left arm and had to have two surgeries to set the\r\nbones.  He later testified C.S.H. may have used his elbow to break his arm. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKeith Beason, who witnessed these events, testified that on the school bus, C.S.H. \"tapped\"\r\nBevington on the face, the two stood nose-to-nose, Bevington warned C.S.H. not to do it again,\r\nC.S.H. \"tapped him on the face again,\" the two began to scuffle, and the bus driver ordered the two\r\nseparated.  Beason testified he went to the front of the bus to throw away some trash, and Bevington\r\ntold him \"he was still mad about the whole situation and if he -- if they got in another fight he didn't\r\nwant me to break it up.\"  He testified he told C.S.H. about Bevington's comments. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBeason testified that when C.S.H. exited the school bus, he immediately began walking\r\ntoward Bevington's stop.  When Bevington exited the bus, he walked toward C.S.H., meeting him\r\nalmost halfway.  He testified, however, that he did not see who threw the first punch and did not see\r\nhow Bevington's arm was broken. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. testified he thought he and Bevington were \"playing\" on the bus when he \"tapped\"\r\nBevington on the face.  However, Bevington became angry and told C.S.H. that if C.S.H ever\r\ntouched him again, he would kill C.S.H. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. testified that after the bus driver separated them, Beason told him that \"[Bevington]\r\nwanted to make it even and if [Bevington] got into a fight [Bevington] didn't want anybody to break\r\nit up.\"  Beason also told him, \"[A] couple of times [Bevington] had got mad about something and\r\npulled a knife on a boy and threatened to kill him.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. testified he was puzzled about why Bevington was still mad, so when he exited the\r\nbus, he walked toward Bevington's bus stop to \"talk some sense into him.\"  Bevington met him about\r\nhalfway, \"got nose-to-nose\" with him, and said \"he was going to whip my butt.\"  He testified it was\r\nBevington who made the first move. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[H]e had put his arm around, threw me, he hit me right here with the ring and I\r\nfought my way back up and he grabbed hold of my face and I was right here and he\r\nhad my head like this and pushed my arm then he grabbed hold of my legs going to\r\nbring me down like a football tackle and my -- he twisted me around like this, he\r\ntwisted my face down with his arm under him and I landed on top of him and I heard\r\nsomething snap and I looked around, it wasn't no limbs or tree or anything, I knew\r\nthat he was going - that something had broke.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>He testified he did not intend to break Bevington's arm.  He testified that after Bevington's arm was\r\nbroken, the two went their separate ways. <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen considering a factual sufficiency challenge, we must consider and weigh all of the\r\nevidence, not just that evidence supporting the verdict.  <em>Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis</em>,<em> </em>971 S.W.2d\r\n402, 407 (Tex. 1998).  We may set aside the verdict only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming\r\nweight of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust.  <em>Id.</em>  We are not a fact-finder.  <em>Id.</em> \r\nAccordingly, we may not pass on the witnesses' credibility or substitute our judgment for the fact-finder's, even if the evidence would clearly support a different result.  <em>Id.</em></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. contends Bevington's version of the events is implausible because, according to\r\nBevington, he was able to get free from C.S.H., move behind him, hit him, and trip him, all after\r\nhaving his arm broken in two places and rendered useless.  He also observes the State failed to offer\r\nmedical testimony to show whether the breaks were caused by Bevington's arm being twisted, by\r\nhaving an elbow forced against it, or by being injured in a fall.  He contends a more plausible version\r\nof the events is that Bevington's arm was broken when the two young men fell to the ground.  At\r\nmost, C.S.H. contends the evidence shows he acted recklessly, but the State did not allege\r\nrecklessness as a culpable mental state.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAggravated assault is a result-of-conduct offense.  <em>Mendenhall v. State</em>, 15 S.W.3d 560, 567\r\n(Tex. App.-Waco 2000), <em>aff'd on other grounds</em>, 77 S.W.3d 815 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002); <em>Brooks\r\nv. State</em>, 967 S.W.2d 946, 950 (Tex. App.-Austin 1998, no pet.).  A person acts intentionally, or with\r\nintent, with respect to a result of his or her conduct when it is his or her conscious objective or desire\r\nto cause the result.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 6.03(a) (Vernon 1994).  A person acts knowingly, or\r\nwith knowledge, with respect to a result of his or her conduct when the person is aware his or her\r\nconduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 6.03(b) (Vernon 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere was evidence C.S.H. twisted Bevington's arm until it broke and then taunted him about\r\nhis injury.  Bevington also suggested C.S.H. used his elbow to break his arm.  From this testimony,\r\nthe trial court could have concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that it was C.S.H.'s\r\nconscious objective or desire to break Bevington's arm or that C.S.H. was aware his actions were\r\nreasonably certain to cause that result.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe verdict in this case revolved around the weight and credibility given to the witnesses'\r\ntestimony.  Because the only testimony regarding how Bevington's arm was broken came from\r\nBevington and C.S.H., the trial court was faced with a decision about whom to believe.  C.S.H.\r\ncontends that the failure of the State to put on medical evidence about the injury demonstrates a\r\nweakness in the State's case.  Either side could have offered such evidence.  We do not find the State\r\nfailed in its burden of proof by not presenting medical evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court watched Bevington demonstrate how he was injured.  It also heard him testify\r\nabout where his arm was broken.  As fact-finder, the trial court had sufficient evidence to find that\r\nC.S.H. engaged in delinquent conduct by breaking Bevington's arm.  Based on the record before us,\r\nwe cannot say the verdict is so against the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly\r\nwrong or unjust.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe judgment is affirmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tBen Z. Grant</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Date Submitted:\tSeptember 13, 2002</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Date Decided:\t\tDecember 10, 2002</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Do Not Publish</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nherewith, if compliance is prevented by, or if such failure is the result of, any such Law, Order, Rule\r\nor Regulation.\"  As such, the lease requires compliance to be \"prevented by\" or \"the result of, any\r\nsuch Law, Order, Rule or Regulation.\"  If the regulation is within the control of the lessee,\r\ncompliance is not prevented or the result of the regulation.  Here, the requirement that Moore post\r\nsecurity did not compel the termination of production, but imposed conditions for all producers to\r\ncomply with in order to continue production.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen construing a lease similar to the lease in this case, the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals\r\nreached a similar conclusion.  <em>See Albrecht</em>, 878 S.W.2d 236.  Similar to this lease, the lease did not\r\ncontain the phrase \"beyond the reasonable control of the lessee.\"  <em>See id.</em> at 242.  Because the\r\noperator had failed to comply with its regulations, the Railroad Commission ordered a well shut-in. \r\n<em>Id.</em> at 236.  The court held the force-majeure clause was not triggered because the compliance was\r\nwithin the reasonable control of the lessee.  <em>Id</em>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen construing a force-majeure clause identical to the clause in this case, the Tenth Circuit\r\nhas concluded the \"governmental regulation at issue must preclude a lessee from performing the\r\nsought-after relief.\"  <em>Watts v. Atl. Richfield Co.</em>, 115 F.3d 785, 796 (10th Cir. 1997).  The court\r\nreasoned that \"[m]ere compliance with a governmental regulation\" would not satisfy the force-majeure clause.  <em>Id</em>.  Because the lessee could have complied with the regulation at issue and still\r\nhave protected the unit from drainage, the court held the force-majeure clause did not protect the\r\nlessee.  <em>Id</em>.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream introduced summary judgment evidence that other producers in the area were able\r\nto comply with the financial assurance regulation.  In his summary judgment affidavit, William L.\r\nRudd, III, states he was able to comply with the financial assurance regulation and \"[o]ther operators\r\nof the size of T&amp;M Production were able to obtain financial assurance without a problem.\"  Once\r\nthe movant establishes that it is entitled to summary judgment, the burden shifts to the nonmovant\r\nto show why summary judgment should not be granted.  <em>Casso v. Brand</em>, 776 S.W.2d 551, 556 (Tex.\r\n1989).  In his summary judgment affidavit, Moore states he requested a hearing in 2002 \"because\r\nbonds were for all practical purposes not available.\"  Even if this is some evidence that bonds were\r\nnot available in 2002, this statement is not evidence that bonds were unavailable in 2004.  Further,\r\nthe financial assurance was not required to be a bond.  Ultimately, Moore obtained a letter of credit\r\nfrom a bank rather than obtaining a bond.  The statement does not indicate whether forms of\r\nfinancial assurance, other than bonds, were available.  Moore also introduced numerous articles from\r\n<em>The American Oil &amp; Gas Reporter</em>.  Moore claims these articles create a fact issue.  While the\r\narticles discuss that many small operators were unable to comply with the financial assurance\r\nrequirements, the articles also state that some operators were able to comply with the regulations. \r\nThus, Moore's own summary judgment evidence establishes at least some forms of financial\r\nassurance were available.  The summary judgment evidence conclusively established forms of\r\nfinancial assurance were available.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted by the Fifth Circuit:  \"[i]f a contractor were able to escape his responsibilities\r\nmerely by causing an excusing event to occur, he would have no effective 'obligation to perform.'\" <em>\r\nNissho-Iwai Co. v. Occidental Crude Sales, Inc.</em>, 729 F.2d 1530, 1540 (5th Cir. 1984) (whether\r\nforce-majeure clause in contract to deliver oil applied due to restrictions imposed by Libya). \r\nBecause the evidence conclusively established forms of financial assurance were available, the Texas\r\nRailroad Commission's regulation requiring financial assurance did not preclude compliance with\r\nthe lease.  Similar to <em>Watts</em>, the regulation was not a force-majeure event.  The trial court did not err\r\nin granting Jet Stream's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>II.</strong>\t<strong>Due Diligence Was Not an Issue Under the Force-Majeure Clause</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues there is a fact issue concerning whether he was diligent in obtaining the\r\nfinancial assurance requirements.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span>  While due diligence is required for certain provisions of oil and\r\ngas leases such as the implied covenant of reasonable development, due diligence is not an issue\r\nwhen deciding whether a force-majeure clause applies.  Unless the lease provides otherwise, Texas\r\nlaw is well established that due diligence is not required under force-majeure clauses.  <em>See Holt</em>, 984\r\nS.W.2d at 283.  Further, Moore did not argue there was a fact issue on diligence to the trial court. \r\nIn his motion for summary judgment, Moore argued there were no genuine issues of material fact\r\nconcerning the force-majeure clause.  This issue is not preserved for appellate review.  <em>See </em>Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. 33.1.  We overrule Moore's second point.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>III.\tProduction on the N.B. Perry Survey Did Not Hold the Lease</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore claims, in his third point of error, that there was production on the 1533.27 acres\r\noriginally leased under the 1943 lease.  The evidence conclusively established that at least one well\r\nwas producing in the N.B. Perry Survey.  The entire N.B. Perry Survey was among the property\r\nincluded in the original 1533.27 acres covered by the lease.  However, Rudd testified these wells\r\nwere released in 1954 from the 1943 lease.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>  For the sake of convenience, we will refer to the land\r\nreleased from the 1943 lease as the Perry Tract and refer to the remainder of the land under the 1943\r\nlease as the Rudd Tract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore claims that the production on the Perry Tract prevented the lease from terminating. \r\nThe Texas Supreme Court has disagreed.  In <em>Ridge Oil</em>, the Texas Supreme Court held that\r\nproduction on the Ridge Tract did not hold the lease on the Guinn Tract after the lease had\r\nterminated as to the Ridge Tract.  <em>Ridge Oil Co. v. Guinn Invs., Inc.</em>, 148 S.W.3d 143, 153 (Tex.\r\n2004).  Both tracts had previously been covered by the same 1937 lease.  <em>Id</em>.  However, when the\r\nparties executed a new lease for the Ridge tract, the 1937 lease effectively terminated for the Ridge\r\nTract.  <em>Id</em>.  After the lease terminated, the Texas Supreme Court held the production on the Ridge\r\nTract no longer held the lease for the Guinn Tract.  Similarly, the release of the Perry Tract from the\r\nlease terminated the lease as to the Perry Tract.  As such, production on the Perry Tract did not hold\r\nthe lease as to the Rudd Tract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues that the language of the lease requires all production to cease on all the\r\nproperty originally leased in 1943.  In essence, Moore argues the fact that some of the acreage had\r\nbeen released from the lease is irrelevant.  Moore directs us to two provisions in the lease:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t2.  Subject to the other provisions herein contained, this lease shall be for a\r\nterm of Five years, from this date (called \"primary term\") and as long thereafter as\r\noil, gas or other mineral is produced from said land or land which said land is pooled\r\nhereunder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t8.  The rights of either party hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part,\r\nand the provisions hereof shall extend to the heirs, successors and assigns of the\r\nparties hereto, but no change or division in ownership of the land, rental or royalties\r\nhowever accomplished shall operate to enlarge the obligations or diminish the rights\r\nof lessee; and no such change in ownership shall be binding on lessee nor impair the\r\neffectiveness of any payments made hereunder until lessee shall have been furnished,\r\nforty-five (45) days before payment is due, a certified copy recorded instrument\r\nevidencing any transfer, inheritance, sale, or other change in ownership.  In the event\r\nof assignment of this lease as to a segregated portion of said land, the rentals payable\r\nhereunder shall be apportionable as between the several leasehold owners ratably\r\naccording to the surface area of each, and default in rental payment by one shall not\r\naffect the rights of other leasehold owners, hereunder.  If six or more parties other\r\nthan the original lessor become entitled to royalty hereunder, lessee may withhold\r\npayment of royalty to such parties unless and until furnished with a recordable\r\ninstrument executed by all of such parties designating an agent to receive payment\r\nfor all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>According to Moore, the above provisions of the lease preclude the lease from terminating because\r\nproduction occurred on a tract of land described in the lease even though the tract upon which\r\nproduction had continued had been released from the lease. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues, because the lease provides \"no change or division in ownership of the land,\r\nrental or royalties however accomplished shall operate to enlarge the obligations or diminish the\r\nrights of lessee,\" the release from the lease of the only producing tract is not relevant.  The second\r\nprovision, contained in paragraph 8, appears to be an entirety clause.  An entirety clause is intended\r\n\"to preserve the lease as an indivisible operating unit despite transfers of title by the lessor.\" \r\n4 Kuntz, The Law of Oil &amp; Gas, § 48.2, p. 144 (1990); 4-6 Williams &amp; Meyers, Oil &amp; Gas Law\r\n§ 678 (Lexis 2006).  The clause in paragraph 8 references changes in rental payments and royalties\r\nbased on assignments or other changes in ownership.  It specifically provides \"rentals payable\r\nhereunder shall be apportionable.\"  One of the purposes of an entirety clause is to relieve the parties\r\nof the obligations of the nonapportionment rule.  4 Kuntz, The Law of Oil &amp; Gas, § 48.2, p. 144. \r\nThe nonapportionment rule provides that royalty payments will only be paid to the extent of the\r\nlessor's interest in the tract where the well is located.  <em>Id</em>. at p. 145.  The nonapportionment rule may\r\ncause a lessor to duplicate equipment and require a lessor to protect against internal drainage, i.e.,\r\ndrainage from another subdivided portion of the same leased premises.  <em>Id</em>. at pp. 144-46.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tParagraph 8 only prohibits changes in ownership under the lease from enlarging the\r\nobligations or diminishing the rights of the lessee; it does not apply to tracts of land which have been\r\nreleased from the lease.  Moore ignores the beginning phrase of the paragraph which provides \"[t]he\r\nrights of either party hereunder.\"  The use of the word \"hereunder\" implies the clause only applies\r\nto tracts of land to which the lease applies.  The rest of the paragraph indicates such a conclusion was\r\nthe intent of the parties.  The rest of the paragraph contains the following phrases:  \"payments made\r\nhereunder,\" \"assignment of this lease,\" and \"other leasehold owners hereunder.\"  We conclude the\r\nintent of the parties was for the paragraph to only apply to tracts of land still bound by the lease. \r\nTherefore, the prohibition in paragraph 8 does not apply to changes of ownership of tracts which\r\nhave been released from the lease.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe first provision, contained in paragraph 2 of the lease, merely references the land without\r\nany qualification for whether the acreage had been released from the lease.  Thus, Moore argues\r\nproduction on land described in the lease will hold the lease regardless of whether the lease still\r\napplies to the property.  The lessor is permitted, under the lease, to release tracts of land from the\r\nlease.  The lease provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t4.  . . . Lessee, or any assignee hereunder, may at any time execute and deliver\r\nto lessor, or to the depository above named, or place of record, a release or releases\r\ncovering any portion or portions of the premises held by him, and thereby surrender\r\nthis lease as to such portion or portions, and thereafter the rentals payable by him\r\nshall be reduced proportionately.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>When construing a lease, we must examine the entire lease and attempt to harmonize all its\r\nprovisions.  <em>Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v. Thompson</em>, 94 S.W.3d 550, 554 (Tex. 2002); <em>Coker v.\r\nCoker</em>, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983).  When the clauses are read together, the intent of the\r\nparties was for \"said land\" to refer to land subject to this lease.  Because the Perry Tract was released\r\nfrom the lease, it was no longer land subject to the lease.  As such, the phrase \"said land\" does not\r\nrefer to the Perry Tract. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore cites <em>Mathews v. Sun Oil Co.</em> for the proposition that, when an oil and gas lease covers\r\nland consisting of multiple tracts, production on one tract will operate to perpetuate the lease as to\r\nall tracts.  425 S.W.2d 330, 333 (Tex. 1968).  The present case, though, is distinguishable.  While\r\nthe lease in dispute covers multiple tracts, the only tracts on which there was production have been\r\npreviously released from the lease. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, Moore cites <em>Ridge Oil Co.</em> for the proposition that an oil and gas lease does not\r\nterminate when there are multiple operators under a lease and there is production by only one\r\noperator.  148 S.W.3d at 149-50.  As discussed above, the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Ridge Oil</em>\r\nultimately held production on the Ridge Tract did not hold the Guinn Tract.  <em>Id</em>. at 153.  We note the\r\nTexas Supreme Court did hold, when there are multiple operators under a lease and there is\r\nproduction by only one operator, the production holds the lease.  <em>Id</em>.  However, this holding required\r\nboth the nonproducing operator and the producing operator to be assignees of the same lease.  That\r\nis not the situation we have in this case.  In this case, the evidence shows the producing operator was\r\na lessee under a different lease.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Moore argues the lease has been pooled.  Moore, though, has not directed this Court\r\nto where there is evidence of pooling of the Rudd Tract.  Moore argues \"production from the Haddad\r\nNo. 1 Lease, which had been pooled with the acreage in the N.B. Perry Survey held his lease as\r\nshown by the Pooling Declaration and Agreement in the record.\"  The record citations merely show\r\nthat the Perry Tract was pooled.  The fact that land which has been released from the lease has been\r\npooled does not hold the lease.  The record does not contain any evidence that any tracts which have\r\nnot been released from the lease have been pooled with producing tracts.  Moore's third point of error\r\nis overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>IV.\tThe Doctrine of Implied Temporary Cessation Does Not Apply</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the alternative, Moore claims the implied temporary cessation doctrine precludes\r\ntermination.  Under the implied temporary cessation doctrine, a temporary cessation of production\r\nwill not cause the lease to terminate and the lessee is entitled to a reasonable time in which to remedy\r\nthe defect and resume production.  <em>See Midwest Oil Corp. v. Winsauer</em>, 159 Tex. 560, 323 S.W.2d\r\n944, 946 (1959).  The implied temporary cessation doctrine does not apply when a lease contains \"a\r\nprovision in the habendum clause which expresses a time limitation within which continued drilling\r\nor reworking operations must be conducted.\" <em> Holt</em>, 984 S.W.2d at 281-82; <em>Samano v. Sun Oil Co.</em>,\r\n621 S.W.2d 580, 581-84 (Tex. 1981); <em>Ridenour v. Herrington</em>, 47 S.W.3d 117, 120 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Waco 2001, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the lease at issue contained explicit language limiting the cessation of production\r\nto a specific time period, the doctrine of implied temporary cessation does not apply.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>V.\tMoore Is Not Entitled to Forty Acres Around Each Well</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifth point of error, Moore claims he is entitled to forty acres around each of the two\r\nwells.  The lease provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t9.  In case of cancellation or termination of this lease from any cause, Lessee\r\nshall have the right to retain, under the terms hereof, around each well producing,\r\nbeing worked on, or drilling hereunder, the number of acres in the form allocated to\r\neach such well under spacing and proration rules issued by Texas Railroad\r\nCommission of the State of Texas, or any other State or Federal authority having\r\ncontrol of such matters; or, in the absence of such rulings; forty (40) acres around\r\neach such well in as near a square form as practicable, and in the event lessor\r\nconsiders that operations are not being conducted in compliance with this contract,\r\nlessee shall be notified in writing of the facts relied upon as constituting a breach\r\nhereof and lessee shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice to comply\r\nwith the obligations imposed by virtue of this instrument.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Moore argues \"[i]t is uncontraverted [sic] that Appellant was producing two wells on his lease at the\r\ntime Appellees gave him notice that his lease had 'expired in accordance with its terms'\" and claims\r\nhe is entitled to retain forty acres around each well.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues, in a lease terminated due to nonproduction, there were producing wells.  The\r\nkey to this argument is that Moore defines a different date of termination than Jet Stream.  If the\r\nlease terminated due to nonproduction, Moore assumes termination occurred when he received the\r\nnotice of termination.  Two wells were producing at the time Moore received the notice of\r\ntermination sent by Jet Stream.  Jet Stream asserts the date of termination was thirty days after the\r\nproduction ceased.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Texas Supreme Court and this Court have both held a lease, after the primary term has\r\nexpired, automatically terminates after production is ceased.<em>  Watson v. Rochmill</em>, 137 Tex. 565, 155\r\nS.W.2d 783, 784 (1941) (\"It appears to be very well settled that under the terms of the lease, upon\r\ncessation of production after termination of the primary term, the lease automatically terminated.\");\r\n<em>Fuller v. Rainbow Res., Inc.</em>, 744 S.W.2d 232, 234 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1987, no writ); <em>see Pool</em>,\r\n124 S.W.3d at 203 (\"under the automatic termination rule, without a savings clause, cessation of\r\nproduction in the secondary term automatically terminates the lease, even if profitable production\r\nis later restored\");<em> Waggoner &amp; Zeller Oil Co. v. Deike</em>, 508 S.W.2d 163, 166 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Austin 1974, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  Production of oil or gas constitutes a special limitation on the\r\ndeterminable fee transferred.  <em>Id.</em> at 166.  If drilling operations are not commenced within the\r\nspecified time, the lease automatically terminates.  <em>Id</em>.  Because there is nothing a lessee could do\r\nto correct or begin to correct the breach of a special limitation, any notice provision does not apply. \r\n<em>Id</em>.  The lease automatically terminated when production was not resumed within the specified time,\r\nand notice of termination was not required.  At the time the lease automatically terminated, there\r\nwere no producing wells.<sup> (6)</sup></span><span>  As such, the clause does not apply.  Moore's fifth point of error is\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>VI.\tThe Trial Court Erred In Issuing an Injunction Prohibiting Moore From Recovering\r\nHis Equipment</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixth point of error, Moore argues the trial court erred in denying Moore's motion for\r\nsummary judgment seeking recovery of his equipment still on the land, including the well casings. \r\nMoore had brought a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that he had the right to remove\r\nhis equipment, including the casings.  Jet Stream failed to respond to this counterclaim in either his\r\nmotion for partial summary judgment or in the brief in support thereof.  After granting Jet Stream's\r\nmotion for partial summary judgment and denying Moore's motion for summary judgment, the trial\r\ncourt set the case for trial. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his answer and counterclaim, Moore pled that, in the event the lease terminated, he had\r\n\"the right at any time during or after the expiration of this Lease to remove all property and fixtures\r\nplaced by lessee on said land, including the right to draw and remove all casing on the property.\" \r\nThis issue was not disposed by the partial summary judgment.  Although not listed among the issues\r\nset for trial, the record indicates the trial was intended to resolve all remaining issues.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span>  Moore was\r\nafforded the opportunity to present evidence at the trial, and Jet Stream cross-examined Moore\r\nconcerning his testimony.  Neither party argues the trial court's judgment was not final or complains\r\nthat this issue was not among those set for trial.  The final judgment disposes of all parties and all\r\nclaims.  A judgment that disposes of all parties and all claims is final and appealable.  <em>Lehmann v.\r\nHar-Con Corp.</em>, 39 S.W.3d 191 (Tex. 2001).  The trial court's judgment is a final, appealable order. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Moore testified that the value of \"all the equipment and casing\" for the well\r\nsites would be approximately $100,000.00.  In its final judgment, the trial court issued a permanent\r\ninjunction enjoining Moore from \"taking any action to interfere with the current status of the wells\r\n. . . including specifically taking any action to remove equipment from the wells or otherwise\r\nchanging the current status of the well pending further order of this court.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream argues Moore is currently in possession of the fixtures, the issue is not ripe, and\r\na party cannot appeal the denial of a summary judgment.  First, there is no evidence in the record\r\nconcerning who is in possession of the equipment.  Second, Jet Stream fails to cite any authority for\r\nthe proposition the issue is not ripe for adjudication and as such the issue of ripeness is inadequately\r\nbriefed.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Thus, the only argument advanced by Jet Stream that merits\r\nattention is whether an appellant can appeal the denial of a motion for summary judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhere a motion for summary judgment is denied by the trial court and the case is tried on\r\nits merits, the order denying the summary judgment cannot be reviewed on appeal.  <em>Ackermann v.\r\nVordenbaum</em>, 403 S.W.2d 362, 365 (Tex. 1966); <em>Williams v. Colthurst</em>, 253 S.W.3d 353 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Eastland 2008, no pet.); <em>Cleaver v. Cundiff</em>, 203 S.W.3d 373, 379 (Tex. App.--Eastland\r\n2006, pet. denied); <em>Anderton v. Schindler</em>, 154 S.W.3d 928, 931 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2005, no pet.);\r\n<em>see Valencia v. Garza</em>, 765 S.W.2d 893 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1989, no writ).  Because Moore\r\ncannot appeal the denial of his summary judgment motion, we will, in the interest of justice, interpret\r\nMoore's sixth point of error as challenging the trial court's permanent injunction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe lease in this case provides the \"[l]essee shall have the right at any time during or after\r\nthe expiration of this lease to remove all property and fixtures placed by lessee on said land,\r\nincluding the right to draw and remove all casings.\"  An operator has an implied right to remove\r\nleasehold equipment \"within a reasonable time of the expiration of the lease, even in the absence of\r\na specific provision authorizing such removal.\"  <em>McCormick v. Krueger</em>, 593 S.W.2d 729, 731 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <em>cf. Exxon Corp. v. Pluff</em>, 94 S.W.3d 22, 30\r\n(Tex. App.--Tyler 2002, pet. denied) (no implied duty to remove equipment).  Leasehold equipment\r\nis considered personal property.  <em>See id</em>.; <em>Meers v. Frick-Reid Supply Corp</em>., 127 S.W.2d 493, 496\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1939, writ dism'd); <em>Orfic Gasoline Prod. Co. v. Herring</em>, 273 S.W. 944,\r\n945 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1925, no writ).  We note, though, the lessee does not have the right to\r\nremove the well casing if the well is producing or the removal would damage the well.  <em>See Patton\r\nv. Rogers</em>, 417 S.W.2d 470, 478 (Tex. Civ. App.--San Antonio 1967, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (\"an owner\r\nhas no right to remove casing from a producing oil and gas well\");<em> Eubank v. Twin Mountain Oil\r\nCorp.</em>, 406 S.W.2d 789, 791 (Tex. Civ. App.--Eastland 1966, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  \"Where the owner\r\nof the casing is precluded by the principle of equity . . . from removing the casings from a well\r\nproducing or capable of producing products in paying quantities, he is, nevertheless, entitled to just\r\ncompensation measured by the value of such casing in place less the cost of removing the same.\" \r\n<em>Fike v. Riddle</em>, 677 S.W.2d 722, 727 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1984, no writ).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore had the right to recover his equipment except the well casing.  Moore was also entitled\r\nto the value of the well casing less the cost of removal.  Moore testified that the value of \"all of the\r\nequipment and casing\" for the well sites would be approximately $100,000.00.  This is some\r\nevidence of the total value of all of the equipment and the well casing.  However, the record contains\r\nno evidence of the cost of removing the well casing.  Because it was Moore's burden to introduce\r\nevidence of both the value of the well casing and the cost of its removal, the trial court did not err\r\nin failing to enter a finding of damages for the casing.  Except for the well casing, the trial court\r\nerred in enjoining Moore from removing his equipment from the lease property.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>VII.\tThe Trial Court Erred in Awarding Gross Revenue</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his seventh point of error, Moore argues the trial court erred when it awarded Jet Stream\r\ndamages measured by the gross revenue from oil sales after Moore resumed production in 2005.  On\r\nrehearing, Moore directs this Court to Jet Stream's request in its petition that a temporary injunction\r\nbe issued prohibiting Moore from ceasing production during the pendency of the proceedings. \r\nMoore argues Jet Stream should be estopped from collecting damages for bad faith trespass and\r\nshould be limited to damages for good faith trespass.<sup> (8)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a producer trespasses and extracts oil, gas, or other minerals, the method by which\r\ndamages are calculated depends on whether the producer's actions are in good faith.  If a producer\r\ntrespasses in good faith, the measure of damages is the value of the minerals minus drilling and\r\noperating costs.  <em>Mayfield v. de Benavides</em>, 693 S.W.2d 500, 506 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1985,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.); <em>see Bender v. Brooks</em>, 103 Tex. 329, 335, 127 S.W. 168, 171 (1910).  \"To be in\r\ngood faith in developing a tract of land for oil or gas, one must have both an honest and a reasonable\r\nbelief in the superiority of one's title.\"  <em>Mayfield</em>, 693 S.W.2d at 504;<em> Gulf Prod. Co. v. Spear</em>, 125\r\nTex. 530, 84 S.W.2d 452, 457 (1935).  The measure of damages for bad faith trespass, though, is\r\n\"'the value of the things mined at the time of severance without making deduction for the cost of\r\nlabor and other expenses incurred in committing the wrongful act . . . or for any value he may have\r\nadded to the mineral by his labor.'\"  <em>Mayfield</em>, 693 S.W.2d at 506 (quoting <em>Cage Bros. v. Whiteman</em>,\r\n139 Tex. 522, 163 S.W.2d 638, 642 (1942)).  The measure of damages for bad faith trespass is\r\nintended to both compensate the owner and to punish the trespasser.  1 Kuntz, The Law of Oil &amp;\r\nGas, § 11.3, p. 309 (1987).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn our original opinion, we concluded the trial court did not err in awarding damages based\r\non a bad faith trespass because it was uncontested Moore extracted the oil with full knowledge of\r\nan adverse claim.<sup> (9)</sup>  After reconsideration, we conclude the facts that Jet Stream--1) affirmatively\r\nrequested production not be suspended, and 2) agreed to the temporary injunction--should estop Jet\r\nStream from obtaining damages based on bad faith trespass.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream denies, in its response to Moore's motion for rehearing, that it requested Moore\r\nbe temporarily enjoined from ceasing production.  According to Jet Stream, the agreed temporary\r\ninjunction represented \"a compromise as to the scope of the injunctive relief granted, specifically\r\ndenying the relief requested by Appellees that Appellant not be permitted to continue production.\"<sup> (10)</sup> \r\nJet Stream directs us to language in the petition that Moore be enjoined from \"continuing to produce\r\nthe property . . . .\"  This language, however, is contained in paragraph VIII of Jet Stream's original\r\npetition which requests a permanent injunction.<sup> (11)</sup>  Paragraph IX of Jet Stream's original petition\r\nprovides as follows, in pertinent part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefendant should be cited to appear and show cause why he or it should not be\r\n<em>temporarily restrained</em>, during the pendency of this action, <em>from shutting in\r\nproduction of oil, gas or other minerals from the Property</em>, from removing the\r\nequipment or plugging the Wells located on the Property, from accepting the\r\nproceeds of sale for gas produced from the Property from any third party, and upon\r\nhearing, why a receiver should not be appointed to operate the Wells.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  As demonstrated by the quoted language, Jet Stream affirmatively requested in\r\nits original petition that production continue.<sup> (12)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note the Austin Court of Appeals has held a party cannot rely on a temporary injunction\r\nas evidence of good faith because a temporary injunction is merely intended to preserve the status\r\nquo.  <em>Rauch</em>, 905 S.W.2d at 410.  We agree with the Austin court that most temporary injunctions\r\nwill not be evidence of good faith.  This case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Rauch</em>.  The\r\ntemporary injunction in <em>Rauch</em> was not an agreed temporary injunction, and there is no indication\r\nthat the mineral owner affirmatively requested the operator be temporarily enjoined from ceasing\r\nproduction.  In this case, Jet Stream affirmatively requested production to continue in its original\r\npetition and agreed to a temporary injunction which was signed several months later.  In the\r\ntemporary injunction, Jet Stream agreed \"the Defendant is required to continue to operate the wells\r\nas has been operated in the past without any discontinuation of production.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore does not specify which form of estoppel should apply in this case.  We conclude\r\nquasi-estoppel is most applicable here.  The doctrine of quasi-estoppel precludes a party from\r\nasserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken.  <em>Lopez v.\r\nMunoz, Hockema &amp; Reed</em>, 22 S.W.3d 857, 864 (Tex. 2000).  The doctrine applies when it would be\r\nunconscionable to allow a person to maintain a position inconsistent with one to which he or she\r\nacquiesced, or from which he or she accepted a benefit.  <em>See id.</em>; <em>Maguire Oil Co. v. City of Houston</em>,\r\n69 S.W.3d 350, 367 n.7 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2002, pet. denied); <em>Vessels v. Anschutz Corp</em>., 823\r\nS.W.2d 762, 765-66 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1992, writ denied).  Jet Stream successfully requested\r\nthat Moore be temporarily enjoined from ceasing production and accepted the benefit of that\r\nposition.  As such, Jet Stream should be estopped from alleging Moore's conduct, which Jet Stream\r\nrequested and benefitted from, was wrongful.  Moore should not be punished for the conduct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its response, Jet Stream also argues Moore failed to present any evidence regarding the\r\ncosts of production.  Moore testified the costs of production account for approximately sixty percent\r\nof gross revenues.  While Moore could have presented better evidence, Moore's testimony is more\r\nthan a scintilla of evidence.  There is some evidence of the value of the minerals minus drilling and\r\noperating costs.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream affirmatively requested, in its petition and in the agreed temporary injunction, that\r\nproduction continue.  As such, Jet Stream is estopped from seeking damages for bad faith trespass. \r\nJet Stream's recovery should be limited to damages for good faith trespass--the value of the minerals\r\nminus drilling and operating costs.  The trial court erred in awarding damages for bad faith trespass\r\nbased on gross revenues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>VIII.\tThe Evidence Supporting the Award for Underpayment of Royalties Is Sufficient</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his last point of error, Moore argues the only evidence concerning the underpayment of\r\nroyalties is hearsay and the evidence is insufficient.<sup> (13)</sup></span><span>  At trial, William L. Rudd, III, testified he\r\ncalculated the underpayment of royalties from a review of the Texas Railroad Commission reports\r\nposted online.  Rudd failed to testify how he made these calculations and failed to provide the proper\r\nfoundation for the online reports.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe admission and exclusion of evidence is committed to the trial court's sound discretion;\r\nthus, we review this issue under an abuse of discretion standard.  <em>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</em>,\r\n897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995).  A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts without regard for\r\nany guiding rules or principles.  <em>Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc.</em>, 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42\r\n(Tex. 1985).  Moore failed to object in the trial court to the evidence.  In fact, Moore stated he had\r\n\"no objection\" to the evidence.  Whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the hearsay\r\nis not preserved for appellate review.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven if the evidence is hearsay, we can consider, in an evidentiary sufficiency review,\r\nhearsay evidence admitted without an objection.<sup> (14)</sup></span><span> <em> Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 812 n.29; <em>see </em>Tex. R.\r\nEvid. 802 (\"Inadmissible hearsay admitted without objection shall not be denied probative value\r\nmerely because it is hearsay.\").  The test for legal sufficiency is \"whether the evidence at trial would\r\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.\" <em> Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d\r\nat 827.  When conducting a factual sufficiency review, a court of appeals can set aside the verdict\r\nonly if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that the verdict is clearly wrong\r\nand unjust.  <em>Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis</em>, 971 S.W.2d 402, 407 (Tex. 1998); <em>Cain v. Bain</em>, 709\r\nS.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).  The evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence and the evidence\r\nis not controverted.  The evidence is legally and factually sufficient.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>IX.\tOur Opinion Might Affect the Award of Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn rehearing, Moore argues because he obtained some relief, \"the award of attorney's fees\r\nfor appeal should either be set aside or awarded to both Appellant and Appellee.\"  Jet Stream\r\nrequested and obtained attorney's fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act.  Under Section 37.009,\r\na trial court may award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees that are \"equitable and just.\"  Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008).  \"A prevailing party in a declaratory\r\njudgment action \"is not entitled to attorney's fees simply as a matter of law; entitlement depends on\r\nwhat is equitable and just, and the trial court's power is, in that respect, discretionary.\"  <em>Save Our\r\nSprings Alliance, Inc. v. Lazy Nine Mun. Util. Dist.</em>, 198 S.W.3d 300, 319 (Tex. App.--Texarkana\r\n2006, pet. denied); <em>see Sharp v. Hobart Corp</em>., 957 S.W.2d 650, 654 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, no\r\npet.).  An award of attorney's fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act is not dependent on a finding\r\nthat a party \"substantially prevailed.\"  <em>Barshop v. Medina County Underground Water Conservation\r\nDist</em>., 925 S.W.2d 618, 637 (Tex. 1996); <em>see Bocquet v. Herring</em>, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20 (Tex. 1998);\r\n<em>Flagship Hotel, Ltd. v. City of Galveston</em>, 117 S.W.3d 552, 566 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2003, pet.\r\ndenied).  As such, the fact that Moore prevailed on two issues<sup> (15)</sup> does not dictate that attorney's fees\r\nshould be awarded.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA reversal of the trial court's decision does not necessarily mean the award of attorney's fees\r\nwas an abuse of discretion.  <em>Sava Gumarska in Kemijska Industria D.D. v. Advanced Polymer Scis.,\r\nInc.</em>, 128 S.W.3d 304, 324 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2004, no pet.).  Although, under the facts of this case,\r\nthe trial court's award would not be an abuse of discretion, the trial court might exercise its discretion\r\ndifferently in light of our opinion in this case.  When a judgment is reversed on appeal, the reversal\r\nmay affect whether the award of attorney's fees is equitable and just.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also Barshop</em>, 925\r\nS.W.2d at 637.  \"The trial court's decision whether to award attorney's fees in a declaratory judgment\r\ncase depends on the court's conclusion whether it is just and equitable to do so under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case . . . .\"  <em>In re Estate of Kuykendall</em>, 206 S.W.3d 766, 772 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 2006, no pet.).  Because our opinion on rehearing might affect the trial court's\r\ndetermination, we will remand the award of attorney's fees to the trial court for a determination of\r\nwhether, in light of our opinion, the award is equitable and just.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe modify the trial court's judgment, affirm as modified in part, and reverse and remand in\r\npart.  We reverse the award of damages for bad faith trespass and remand that portion of the case to\r\nthe trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We also reverse the portion of\r\nthe judgment awarding attorney's fees to Jet Stream and remand this portion of the case to the trial\r\ncourt for a determination of whether, in light of our opinion, an award of such fees to Jet Stream is\r\n\"equitable and just.\"  We modify the trial court's judgment to remove the permanent injunction\r\nprohibiting Moore from removing his equipment, with the exception of the well casing, from the\r\nlease property.  As modified, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJack Carter</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Date Submitted:\tAugust 7, 2008</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Date Decided:\t\tAugust 8, 2008</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <span>Moore states in his summary judgment affidavit that coverage was denied due to insufficient\r\nliquid collateral and the lack of general liability insurance, which he had never been required to\r\ncarry.  According to Moore, \"[i]n essence, I was rejected because I was too small an operator.\" \r\n<p>2. </p></span><span>Of the numerous copies of the lease introduced into the record, none of the copies contains\r\na complete legible copy of the statement at issue.  This quotation is the product of combining two\r\nincomplete copies of the lease.  We emphasize that the parties should make sure the record\r\naccurately reflects the entire document at issue--particularly the clauses being disputed.\r\n<p>3. </p></span><span>Moore argues in his brief:  \"[i]f Appellant is not entitled to defend Appellee's suit under the\r\nforce majeure clause as argument in Issue No. 1 above under the theory that he was diligent in\r\nmeeting the financial assurance requirements of the Railroad Commission, then he is entitled to a\r\ntrial on that issue.\"  Moore concludes the argument with the assertion that \"[i]f his diligence is an\r\nissue, Appellant should be able to try this issue and summary judgment should be deemed\r\ninappropriate because of this fact.\"  If Moore is raising the issue of due diligence in the context of\r\na defense other than the force-majeure clause, Moore's brief fails to specify what defense is being\r\nargued.  To the extent this argument can be interpreted as raising a defense other than the force-majeure clause, the argument is inadequately briefed. <em> See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Further, Moore\r\nhas failed to preserve any other defenses by raising them in the trial court.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\r\n<p>4. </p></span><span>The record contains a release dated April 1, 1952, from Phillips Petroleum Company in\r\nwhich Phillips surrenders all interest in the Perry Tract.  The parties have not directed us to where\r\nthe record contains evidence of how Phillips obtained its interest under the lease.  To the extent the\r\nbest evidence rule would require the introduction of the writing proving Phillips' interest, Moore\r\nwaived any error by failing to object in the trial court. <em> See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; Tex. R. Evid. 1002. \r\nMoore did not introduce any evidence contradicting Rudd's testimony.\r\n<p>5. </p></span><span>We note paragraph 5 of the lease contains two specific time limits:  a thirty-day provision\r\nand a sixty-day provision.  Jet Stream argues the thirty-day limit applies.  This opinion should not\r\nbe interpreted as holding the thirty-day provision applies to the facts of this case.  It is not necessary\r\nfor us to decide which specific time limit applies because it is uncontested that production ceased\r\nfor more than sixty days.  \r\n<p>6. </p></span><span>We note the Beaumont Court of Appeals has construed a similar provision and awarded the\r\nlessee forty acres around each producing well.  <em>Hunt Oil Co. v. Dishman</em>, 352 S.W.2d 760 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Beaumont 1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  <em>Hunt Oil</em>, though, is clearly distinguishable from the\r\ncurrent case.  In <em>Hunt Oil</em>, the lease was not terminated for lack of production and there were wells\r\nproducing when the lease terminated.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n<p>7. </p></span><span>Jet Stream did not object when Moore presented evidence concerning the value of the\r\noilfield equipment.  In its brief, Jet Stream alleges this issue was set for trial on the merits. \r\n<p>8. Moore presented the estoppel theory to the trial court in his arguments in support of his\r\nmotion for new trial. \r\n</p><p>9. \"When one enters into possession of land and makes improvements thereon with full\r\nknowledge of the pendency of an action to enforce an adverse claim to the premises, one is\r\nconclusively considered a trespasser in bad faith.\"  <em>Mayfield</em>, 693 S.W.2d at 504; <em>see Houston Prod.\r\nCo. v. Mecom Oil Co.</em>, 62 S.W.2d 75 (Tex. Comm'n App. 1933); <em>NRG Exploration, Inc. v. Rauch</em>,\r\n905 S.W.2d 405, 410 (Tex. App.--Austin 1995, writ denied).  <em>But see</em> <em>Byrom v. Pendley</em>, 717\r\nS.W.2d 602, 604 (Tex. 1986) (no bad faith trespass when cotenant leases mineral rights).  \r\n</p><p>10. Jet Stream claims the \"agreement was that Appellant Moore is permitted to continue\r\nproduction, and the prevailing party to the litigation recovers the proceeds of production.\"  This\r\nargument, though, would require us to go outside the record for facts not in evidence.  This we\r\ndecline to do.\r\n</p><p>11. We note the relevant language in Jet Stream's amended petition is identical to Jet Stream's\r\noriginal petition.  Because the issue here is what position Jet Stream successfully requested, we will\r\nrefer to the original petition rather than the amended petition.\r\n</p><p>12. We note Jet Stream requested that a receiver be appointed to operate the wells.  While this\r\nis evidence that Jet Stream did not desire Moore to continue production, it indicates a desire not to\r\ncease production.  Further, as noted above, Jet Stream agreed to a temporary injunction requiring\r\nMoore to continue production.\r\n</p><p>13. </p></span><span>Although the record contains evidence that Moore accepted the reduced royalty payments\r\nand Moore complains that Jet Stream failed to introduce any of the division orders, Moore does not\r\nargue on appeal that Jet Stream is estopped from collecting underpayment of royalties.  Moore's\r\ncomplaint on appeal is limited to challenging the evidence introduced by Jet Stream.\r\n<p>14. </p></span><span>We note the Texas Supreme Court has stated, \"[i]t has long been the rule in Texas that\r\nincompetent evidence is legally insufficient to support a judgment, even if admitted without\r\nobjection.\"  <em>City of Keller v. Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 812 &amp; n.29 (Tex. 2005).  On rehearing, Moore\r\nargues Rudd's testimony is incompetent because Rudd failed to introduce \"division orders or some\r\ntitle history of the royalties.\"  Moore has failed to cite any authority that such a failure would render\r\nthe testimony incompetent.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).\r\n<p>15. This Court has held the prevailing party is the party to the suit who successfully prosecutes\r\nthe action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the\r\nextent of its original contention.  <em>Flagship Hotel</em>, 117 S.W.3d at 564.  Moore is not the prevailing\r\nparty because he did not prevail on the main issue--the termination of the lease.\r\n\r\n</p></span></p></div>",

On October 31, 2000, the trial court found C.S.H. engaged\r\nin delinquent conduct under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 51.03(a)(1) (Vernon 2002) by committing\r\nburglary of a building, two misdemeanor theft offenses, and misdemeanor criminal mischief.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. Pen. Code Ann. §§ 28.03(b)(2), 30.02(c)(1), 31.03(e)(2)(A)(I) (Vernon Supp. 2003).  The trial\r\ncourt adjudicated C.S.H. delinquent and placed him on two years' probation.  Among the\r\nrequirements of his probation, C.S.H. was ordered to \"commit no offense against the laws of this or\r\nany other State, or of the United States.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAbout a year later, the State moved to modify C.S.H.'s disposition, alleging he violated the\r\nrequirements of his probation by intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury to\r\nChristopher Levi Bevington by severely breaking his arm.  <em>See</em> Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 22.02(a)(1)\r\n(Vernon 1994) (aggravated assault).  After a hearing, the trial court found C.S.H. engaged in\r\ndelinquent conduct, modified his disposition, and committed him to TYC.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. contends there is factually insufficient evidence that he intentionally or knowingly\r\ncaused serious bodily injury to Bevington.  At the hearing, Bevington testified as follows.  He and\r\nC.S.H. rode the same bus to and from school.  On the day of the alleged assault, he and C.S.H.\r\nbecame involved in a physical confrontation on the bus on the way home from school.  C.S.H.\r\nslapped Bevington on the cheek, and Bevington told him something to the effect of, \"I swear to all\r\nthe angels in heaven if you ever do that again I will . . . kick [your] ass.\"  C.S.H. then pinched him\r\nin the face, and the two began to scuffle. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBevington further testified that the bus driver ordered him to sit at the front of the bus and\r\nC.S.H. to sit in the middle.  C.S.H.'s stop was immediately before Bevington's, but the two stops\r\nwere separated by about one hundred feet.  Just before C.S.H.'s stop, Bevington obtained the bus\r\ndriver's permission to retrieve his bag, which was at the back of the bus.  As he walked past C.S.H.,\r\nhe heard C.S.H. say, \"We are going to finish this.\"  Other students asked him whether he was going\r\nto fight C.S.H., and he responded, \"If I have to I will go ahead and do it.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. exited the bus at his regular stop, but he immediately began walking toward\r\nBevington's stop.  Bevington exited the bus at his regular stop and walked about five or ten feet to\r\nmeet C.S.H.  The two faced each other, and C.S.H. told Bevington he was not going to do anything\r\nuntil the bus drove off.  Eventually, Bevington turned to walk away. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs he was walking away, C.S.H. \"grabbed [Bevington's] left arm and twisted it behind\r\n[Bevington's] back.\"  Bevington described the remainder of the altercation as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tWhy don't you stand up and show the judge how it happened?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tOkay.  He -- I will use the arm, he twisted it like that and back with\r\nhis other arm, he had his other arm up against my shoulder and like that he was going\r\nto try to push me back and he was trying to trip me and make me fall backward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAnd I was able to push forward where I would get loose from him and\r\nhis other arm got loose, was right across my shoulder and I was able to -- he had his\r\nother arm around behind me so I was trying to get behind him so I might be able to\r\nhold onto him and maybe calm him down with that spare arm I'm pretty sure that he\r\nwould hold my arm because there wasn't anything else that he could have kept it\r\nwith.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tDid he still have hold of your left arm at that time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tYes.  He still has my left arm twisted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tRight after that I heard a real loud crack sound and my arm throbbed\r\nin loss [sic] of pain.  I was pretty sure it was broken.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAfter that he just let my arm drop and just hang there.  It wasn't\r\nworking at all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tDid he say anything to you at that time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tYes.  Right afterward he said, \"How does that feel, bitch?\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tQ\tOkay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tA\tAfter that I was able to get behind him, my arm was still just dangling,\r\nI got one blow like into it but after that I tripped him and when he fell to the ground\r\nhe grabbed my shirt and pulled me with him and I landed on my right arm so I know\r\nI didn't break my arm when I landed on the ground.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\tAnd when we was [sic] on the ground he got up before I did and he\r\nput my other arm in a twist, too, like he was going to try to break it, my other arm,\r\njust twisted it like that, put it right toward his stomach area, I saw that his body was --\r\nI saw his head was right there and I thought I would take a chance and I kneed him\r\nin the face, after that he used his left arm and pulled me and hit me in the face and\r\nended up butting me and hit both of my wrists and made them pretty puffed up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Bevington sustained breaks to both bones in his left arm and had to have two surgeries to set the\r\nbones.  He later testified C.S.H. may have used his elbow to break his arm. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKeith Beason, who witnessed these events, testified that on the school bus, C.S.H. \"tapped\"\r\nBevington on the face, the two stood nose-to-nose, Bevington warned C.S.H. not to do it again,\r\nC.S.H. \"tapped him on the face again,\" the two began to scuffle, and the bus driver ordered the two\r\nseparated.  Beason testified he went to the front of the bus to throw away some trash, and Bevington\r\ntold him \"he was still mad about the whole situation and if he -- if they got in another fight he didn't\r\nwant me to break it up.\"  He testified he told C.S.H. about Bevington's comments. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBeason testified that when C.S.H. exited the school bus, he immediately began walking\r\ntoward Bevington's stop.  When Bevington exited the bus, he walked toward C.S.H., meeting him\r\nalmost halfway.  He testified, however, that he did not see who threw the first punch and did not see\r\nhow Bevington's arm was broken. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. testified he thought he and Bevington were \"playing\" on the bus when he \"tapped\"\r\nBevington on the face.  However, Bevington became angry and told C.S.H. that if C.S.H ever\r\ntouched him again, he would kill C.S.H. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. testified that after the bus driver separated them, Beason told him that \"[Bevington]\r\nwanted to make it even and if [Bevington] got into a fight [Bevington] didn't want anybody to break\r\nit up.\"  Beason also told him, \"[A] couple of times [Bevington] had got mad about something and\r\npulled a knife on a boy and threatened to kill him.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tC.S.H. testified he was puzzled about why Bevington was still mad, so when he exited the\r\nbus, he walked toward Bevington's bus stop to \"talk some sense into him.\"  Bevington met him about\r\nhalfway, \"got nose-to-nose\" with him, and said \"he was going to whip my butt.\"  He testified it was\r\nBevington who made the first move. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[H]e had put his arm around, threw me, he hit me right here with the ring and I\r\nfought my way back up and he grabbed hold of my face and I was right here and he\r\nhad my head like this and pushed my arm then he grabbed hold of my legs going to\r\nbring me down like a football tackle and my -- he twisted me around like this, he\r\ntwisted my face down with his arm under him and I landed on top of him and I heard\r\nsomething snap and I looked around, it wasn't no limbs or tree or anything, I knew\r\nthat he was going - that something had broke.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>He testified he did not intend to break Bevington's arm.  He testified that after Bevington's arm was\r\nbroken, the two went their separate ways. <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen considering a factual sufficiency challenge, we must consider and weigh all of the\r\nevidence, not just that evidence supporting the verdict.  <em>Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis</em>,<em> </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572837/maritime-overseas-corp-v-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 407 (Tex. 1998).

He also observes the State failed to offer\r\nmedical testimony to show whether the breaks were caused by Bevington's arm being twisted, by\r\nhaving an elbow forced against it, or by being injured in a fall.  He contends a more plausible version\r\nof the events is that Bevington's arm was broken when the two young men fell to the ground.

Here, the requirement that Moore post\r\nsecurity did not compel the termination of production, but imposed conditions for all producers to\r\ncomply with in order to continue production.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen construing a lease similar to the lease in this case, the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals\r\nreached a similar conclusion.  <em>See Albrecht</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410327\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410327/atkinson-gas-co-v-albrecht/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>.  Similar to this lease, the lease did not\r\ncontain the phrase \"beyond the reasonable control of the lessee.\"  <em>See id.</em> at 242.  Because the\r\noperator had failed to comply with its regulations, the Railroad Commission ordered a well shut-in. \r\n<em>Id.</em> at 236.  The court held the force-majeure clause was not triggered because the compliance was\r\nwithin the reasonable control of the lessee.  <em>Id</em>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen construing a force-majeure clause identical to the clause in this case, the Tenth Circuit\r\nhas concluded the \"governmental regulation at issue must preclude a lessee from performing the\r\nsought-after relief.\"  <em>Watts v.

Richfield Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741837\"><a href=\"/opinion/741837/mose-c-watts-individually-mose-c-watts-co-trustee-of-the-mose-c-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span>, 796 (10th Cir. 1997).  The court\r\nreasoned that \"[m]ere compliance with a governmental regulation\" would not satisfy the force-majeure clause.  <em>Id</em>.  Because the lessee could have complied with the regulation at issue and still\r\nhave protected the unit from drainage, the court held the force-majeure clause did not protect the\r\nlessee.  <em>Id</em>.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream introduced summary judgment evidence that other producers in the area were able\r\nto comply with the financial assurance regulation.  In his summary judgment affidavit, William L.\r\nRudd, III, states he was able to comply with the financial assurance regulation and \"[o]ther operators\r\nof the size of T&amp;M Production were able to obtain financial assurance without a problem.\"  Once\r\nthe movant establishes that it is entitled to summary judgment, the burden shifts to the nonmovant\r\nto show why summary judgment should not be granted.  <em>Casso v.

In his summary judgment affidavit, Moore states he requested a hearing in 2002 \"because\r\nbonds were for all practical purposes not available.\"  Even if this is some evidence that bonds were\r\nnot available in 2002, this statement is not evidence that bonds were unavailable in 2004.  Further,\r\nthe financial assurance was not required to be a bond.  Ultimately, Moore obtained a letter of credit\r\nfrom a bank rather than obtaining a bond.  The statement does not indicate whether forms of\r\nfinancial assurance, other than bonds, were available.  Moore also introduced numerous articles from\r\n<em>The American Oil &amp; Gas Reporter</em>.  Moore claims these articles create a fact issue.  While the\r\narticles discuss that many small operators were unable to comply with the financial assurance\r\nrequirements, the articles also state that some operators were able to comply with the regulations. \r\nThus, Moore's own summary judgment evidence establishes at least some forms of financial\r\nassurance were available.  The summary judgment evidence conclusively established forms of\r\nfinancial assurance were available.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted by the Fifth Circuit:  \"[i]f a contractor were able to escape his responsibilities\r\nmerely by causing an excusing event to occur, he would have no effective 'obligation to perform.'\" <em>\r\nNissho-Iwai Co. v.

Similar to <em>Watts</em>, the regulation was not a force-majeure event.  The trial court did not err\r\nin granting Jet Stream's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>II.</strong>\t<strong>Due Diligence Was Not an Issue Under the Force-Majeure Clause</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues there is a fact issue concerning whether he was diligent in obtaining the\r\nfinancial assurance requirements.<sup> (3)</sup></span><span>  While due diligence is required for certain provisions of oil and\r\ngas leases such as the implied covenant of reasonable development, due diligence is not an issue\r\nwhen deciding whether a force-majeure clause applies.  Unless the lease provides otherwise, Texas\r\nlaw is well established that due diligence is not required under force-majeure clauses.  <em>See Holt</em>, 984\r\nS.W.2d at 283.  Further, Moore did not argue there was a fact issue on diligence to the trial court. \r\nIn his motion for summary judgment, Moore argued there were no genuine issues of material fact\r\nconcerning the force-majeure clause.  This issue is not preserved for appellate review.  <em>See </em>Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. 33.1.  We overrule Moore's second point.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>III.\tProduction on the N.B. Perry Survey Did Not Hold the Lease</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore claims, in his third point of error, that there was production on the 1533.27 acres\r\noriginally leased under the 1943 lease.  The evidence conclusively established that at least one well\r\nwas producing in the N.B. Perry Survey.  The entire N.B. Perry Survey was among the property\r\nincluded in the original 1533.27 acres covered by the lease.  However, Rudd testified these wells\r\nwere released in 1954 from the 1943 lease.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>  For the sake of convenience, we will refer to the land\r\nreleased from the 1943 lease as the Perry Tract and refer to the remainder of the land under the 1943\r\nlease as the Rudd Tract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore claims that the production on the Perry Tract prevented the lease from terminating. \r\nThe Texas Supreme Court has disagreed.  In <em>Ridge Oil</em>, the Texas Supreme Court held that\r\nproduction on the Ridge Tract did not hold the lease on the Guinn Tract after the lease had\r\nterminated as to the Ridge Tract.  <em>Ridge Oil Co. v. Guinn Invs., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894591\"><a href=\"/opinion/894591/ridge-oil-co-inc-v-guinn-investments-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 153 (Tex.\r\n2004).  Both tracts had previously been covered by the same 1937 lease.  <em>Id</em>.  However, when the\r\nparties executed a new lease for the Ridge tract, the 1937 lease effectively terminated for the Ridge\r\nTract.  <em>Id</em>.  After the lease terminated, the Texas Supreme Court held the production on the Ridge\r\nTract no longer held the lease for the Guinn Tract.  Similarly, the release of the Perry Tract from the\r\nlease terminated the lease as to the Perry Tract.  As such, production on the Perry Tract did not hold\r\nthe lease as to the Rudd Tract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues that the language of the lease requires all production to cease on all the\r\nproperty originally leased in 1943.  In essence, Moore argues the fact that some of the acreage had\r\nbeen released from the lease is irrelevant.  Moore directs us to two provisions in the lease:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t2.  Subject to the other provisions herein contained, this lease shall be for a\r\nterm of Five years, from this date (called \"primary term\") and as long thereafter as\r\noil, gas or other mineral is produced from said land or land which said land is pooled\r\nhereunder.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t8.  The rights of either party hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part,\r\nand the provisions hereof shall extend to the heirs, successors and assigns of the\r\nparties hereto, but no change or division in ownership of the land, rental or royalties\r\nhowever accomplished shall operate to enlarge the obligations or diminish the rights\r\nof lessee; and no such change in ownership shall be binding on lessee nor impair the\r\neffectiveness of any payments made hereunder until lessee shall have been furnished,\r\nforty-five (45) days before payment is due, a certified copy recorded instrument\r\nevidencing any transfer, inheritance, sale, or other change in ownership.  In the event\r\nof assignment of this lease as to a segregated portion of said land, the rentals payable\r\nhereunder shall be apportionable as between the several leasehold owners ratably\r\naccording to the surface area of each, and default in rental payment by one shall not\r\naffect the rights of other leasehold owners, hereunder.  If six or more parties other\r\nthan the original lessor become entitled to royalty hereunder, lessee may withhold\r\npayment of royalty to such parties unless and until furnished with a recordable\r\ninstrument executed by all of such parties designating an agent to receive payment\r\nfor all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>According to Moore, the above provisions of the lease preclude the lease from terminating because\r\nproduction occurred on a tract of land described in the lease even though the tract upon which\r\nproduction had continued had been released from the lease. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues, because the lease provides \"no change or division in ownership of the land,\r\nrental or royalties however accomplished shall operate to enlarge the obligations or diminish the\r\nrights of lessee,\" the release from the lease of the only producing tract is not relevant.  The second\r\nprovision, contained in paragraph 8, appears to be an entirety clause.  An entirety clause is intended\r\n\"to preserve the lease as an indivisible operating unit despite transfers of title by the lessor.\" \r\n4 Kuntz, The Law of Oil &amp; Gas, § 48.2, p. 144 (1990); 4-6 Williams &amp; Meyers, Oil &amp; Gas Law\r\n§ 678 (Lexis 2006).  The clause in paragraph 8 references changes in rental payments and royalties\r\nbased on assignments or other changes in ownership.  It specifically provides \"rentals payable\r\nhereunder shall be apportionable.\"  One of the purposes of an entirety clause is to relieve the parties\r\nof the obligations of the nonapportionment rule.  4 Kuntz, The Law of Oil &amp; Gas, § 48.2, p. 144. \r\nThe nonapportionment rule provides that royalty payments will only be paid to the extent of the\r\nlessor's interest in the tract where the well is located.  <em>Id</em>. at p. 145.  The nonapportionment rule may\r\ncause a lessor to duplicate equipment and require a lessor to protect against internal drainage, i.e.,\r\ndrainage from another subdivided portion of the same leased premises.  <em>Id</em>. at pp. 144-46.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tParagraph 8 only prohibits changes in ownership under the lease from enlarging the\r\nobligations or diminishing the rights of the lessee; it does not apply to tracts of land which have been\r\nreleased from the lease.  Moore ignores the beginning phrase of the paragraph which provides \"[t]he\r\nrights of either party hereunder.\"  The use of the word \"hereunder\" implies the clause only applies\r\nto tracts of land to which the lease applies.  The rest of the paragraph indicates such a conclusion was\r\nthe intent of the parties.  The rest of the paragraph contains the following phrases:  \"payments made\r\nhereunder,\" \"assignment of this lease,\" and \"other leasehold owners hereunder.\"  We conclude the\r\nintent of the parties was for the paragraph to only apply to tracts of land still bound by the lease. \r\nTherefore, the prohibition in paragraph 8 does not apply to changes of ownership of tracts which\r\nhave been released from the lease.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe first provision, contained in paragraph 2 of the lease, merely references the land without\r\nany qualification for whether the acreage had been released from the lease.  Thus, Moore argues\r\nproduction on land described in the lease will hold the lease regardless of whether the lease still\r\napplies to the property.  The lessor is permitted, under the lease, to release tracts of land from the\r\nlease.  The lease provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t4.  . . . Lessee, or any assignee hereunder, may at any time execute and deliver\r\nto lessor, or to the depository above named, or place of record, a release or releases\r\ncovering any portion or portions of the premises held by him, and thereby surrender\r\nthis lease as to such portion or portions, and thereafter the rentals payable by him\r\nshall be reduced proportionately.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>When construing a lease, we must examine the entire lease and attempt to harmonize all its\r\nprovisions.  <em>Anadarko Petroleum Corp. v. Thompson</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></span>, 554 (Tex. 2002); <em>Coker v.\r\nCoker</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502612\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502612/coker-v-coker/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 393 (Tex. 1983).  When the clauses are read together, the intent of the\r\nparties was for \"said land\" to refer to land subject to this lease.  Because the Perry Tract was released\r\nfrom the lease, it was no longer land subject to the lease.  As such, the phrase \"said land\" does not\r\nrefer to the Perry Tract. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore cites <em>Mathews v. Sun Oil Co.</em> for the proposition that, when an oil and gas lease covers\r\nland consisting of multiple tracts, production on one tract will operate to perpetuate the lease as to\r\nall tracts.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449056\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449056/mathews-v-sun-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 333 (Tex. 1968).  The present case, though, is distinguishable.  While\r\nthe lease in dispute covers multiple tracts, the only tracts on which there was production have been\r\npreviously released from the lease. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, Moore cites <em>Ridge Oil Co.</em> for the proposition that an oil and gas lease does not\r\nterminate when there are multiple operators under a lease and there is production by only one\r\noperator.  148 S.W.3d at 149-50.  As discussed above, the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Ridge Oil</em>\r\nultimately held production on the Ridge Tract did not hold the Guinn Tract.  <em>Id</em>. at 153.  We note the\r\nTexas Supreme Court did hold, when there are multiple operators under a lease and there is\r\nproduction by only one operator, the production holds the lease.  <em>Id</em>.  However, this holding required\r\nboth the nonproducing operator and the producing operator to be assignees of the same lease.  That\r\nis not the situation we have in this case.  In this case, the evidence shows the producing operator was\r\na lessee under a different lease.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Moore argues the lease has been pooled.  Moore, though, has not directed this Court\r\nto where there is evidence of pooling of the Rudd Tract.  Moore argues \"production from the Haddad\r\nNo. 1 Lease, which had been pooled with the acreage in the N.B. Perry Survey held his lease as\r\nshown by the Pooling Declaration and Agreement in the record.\"  The record citations merely show\r\nthat the Perry Tract was pooled.  The fact that land which has been released from the lease has been\r\npooled does not hold the lease.  The record does not contain any evidence that any tracts which have\r\nnot been released from the lease have been pooled with producing tracts.  Moore's third point of error\r\nis overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>IV.\tThe Doctrine of Implied Temporary Cessation Does Not Apply</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the alternative, Moore claims the implied temporary cessation doctrine precludes\r\ntermination.  Under the implied temporary cessation doctrine, a temporary cessation of production\r\nwill not cause the lease to terminate and the lessee is entitled to a reasonable time in which to remedy\r\nthe defect and resume production.  <em>See Midwest Oil Corp. v. Winsauer</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2457759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2457759/midwest-oil-corporation-v-winsauer/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 946 (1959).  The implied temporary cessation doctrine does not apply when a lease contains \"a\r\nprovision in the habendum clause which expresses a time limitation within which continued drilling\r\nor reworking operations must be conducted.\" <em> Holt</em>, 984 S.W.2d at 281-82; <em>Samano v.

The lease provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t9.  In case of cancellation or termination of this lease from any cause, Lessee\r\nshall have the right to retain, under the terms hereof, around each well producing,\r\nbeing worked on, or drilling hereunder, the number of acres in the form allocated to\r\neach such well under spacing and proration rules issued by Texas Railroad\r\nCommission of the State of Texas, or any other State or Federal authority having\r\ncontrol of such matters; or, in the absence of such rulings; forty (40) acres around\r\neach such well in as near a square form as practicable, and in the event lessor\r\nconsiders that operations are not being conducted in compliance with this contract,\r\nlessee shall be notified in writing of the facts relied upon as constituting a breach\r\nhereof and lessee shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice to comply\r\nwith the obligations imposed by virtue of this instrument.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Moore argues \"[i]t is uncontraverted [sic] that Appellant was producing two wells on his lease at the\r\ntime Appellees gave him notice that his lease had 'expired in accordance with its terms'\" and claims\r\nhe is entitled to retain forty acres around each well.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore argues, in a lease terminated due to nonproduction, there were producing wells.  The\r\nkey to this argument is that Moore defines a different date of termination than Jet Stream.  If the\r\nlease terminated due to nonproduction, Moore assumes termination occurred when he received the\r\nnotice of termination.  Two wells were producing at the time Moore received the notice of\r\ntermination sent by Jet Stream.  Jet Stream asserts the date of termination was thirty days after the\r\nproduction ceased.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Texas Supreme Court and this Court have both held a lease, after the primary term has\r\nexpired, automatically terminates after production is ceased.<em>  Watson v.

Jet Stream failed to respond to this counterclaim in either his\r\nmotion for partial summary judgment or in the brief in support thereof.  After granting Jet Stream's\r\nmotion for partial summary judgment and denying Moore's motion for summary judgment, the trial\r\ncourt set the case for trial. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his answer and counterclaim, Moore pled that, in the event the lease terminated, he had\r\n\"the right at any time during or after the expiration of this Lease to remove all property and fixtures\r\nplaced by lessee on said land, including the right to draw and remove all casing on the property.\" \r\nThis issue was not disposed by the partial summary judgment.  Although not listed among the issues\r\nset for trial, the record indicates the trial was intended to resolve all remaining issues.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span>  Moore was\r\nafforded the opportunity to present evidence at the trial, and Jet Stream cross-examined Moore\r\nconcerning his testimony.  Neither party argues the trial court's judgment was not final or complains\r\nthat this issue was not among those set for trial.  The final judgment disposes of all parties and all\r\nclaims.  A judgment that disposes of all parties and all claims is final and appealable.  <em>Lehmann v.\r\nHar-Con Corp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1947466\"><a href=\"/opinion/1947466/lehmann-v-har-con-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span> (Tex. 2001).  The trial court's judgment is a final, appealable order. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Moore testified that the value of \"all the equipment and casing\" for the well\r\nsites would be approximately $100,000.00.  In its final judgment, the trial court issued a permanent\r\ninjunction enjoining Moore from \"taking any action to interfere with the current status of the wells\r\n. . . including specifically taking any action to remove equipment from the wells or otherwise\r\nchanging the current status of the well pending further order of this court.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream argues Moore is currently in possession of the fixtures, the issue is not ripe, and\r\na party cannot appeal the denial of a summary judgment.  First, there is no evidence in the record\r\nconcerning who is in possession of the equipment.  Second, Jet Stream fails to cite any authority for\r\nthe proposition the issue is not ripe for adjudication and as such the issue of ripeness is inadequately\r\nbriefed.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Thus, the only argument advanced by Jet Stream that merits\r\nattention is whether an appellant can appeal the denial of a motion for summary judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhere a motion for summary judgment is denied by the trial court and the case is tried on\r\nits merits, the order denying the summary judgment cannot be reviewed on appeal.  <em>Ackermann v.\r\nVordenbaum</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456648\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456648/ackermann-v-vordenbaum/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 365 (Tex. 1966); <em>Williams v.

Moore was also entitled\r\nto the value of the well casing less the cost of removal.  Moore testified that the value of \"all of the\r\nequipment and casing\" for the well sites would be approximately $100,000.00.  This is some\r\nevidence of the total value of all of the equipment and the well casing.  However, the record contains\r\nno evidence of the cost of removing the well casing.  Because it was Moore's burden to introduce\r\nevidence of both the value of the well casing and the cost of its removal, the trial court did not err\r\nin failing to enter a finding of damages for the casing.  Except for the well casing, the trial court\r\nerred in enjoining Moore from removing his equipment from the lease property.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>VII.\tThe Trial Court Erred in Awarding Gross Revenue</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his seventh point of error, Moore argues the trial court erred when it awarded Jet Stream\r\ndamages measured by the gross revenue from oil sales after Moore resumed production in 2005.  On\r\nrehearing, Moore directs this Court to Jet Stream's request in its petition that a temporary injunction\r\nbe issued prohibiting Moore from ceasing production during the pendency of the proceedings. \r\nMoore argues Jet Stream should be estopped from collecting damages for bad faith trespass and\r\nshould be limited to damages for good faith trespass.<sup> (8)</sup></span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a producer trespasses and extracts oil, gas, or other minerals, the method by which\r\ndamages are calculated depends on whether the producer's actions are in good faith.

The measure of damages for bad faith trespass is\r\nintended to both compensate the owner and to punish the trespasser.  1 Kuntz, The Law of Oil &amp;\r\nGas, § 11.3, p. 309 (1987).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn our original opinion, we concluded the trial court did not err in awarding damages based\r\non a bad faith trespass because it was uncontested Moore extracted the oil with full knowledge of\r\nan adverse claim.<sup> (9)</sup>  After reconsideration, we conclude the facts that Jet Stream--1) affirmatively\r\nrequested production not be suspended, and 2) agreed to the temporary injunction--should estop Jet\r\nStream from obtaining damages based on bad faith trespass.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream denies, in its response to Moore's motion for rehearing, that it requested Moore\r\nbe temporarily enjoined from ceasing production.  According to Jet Stream, the agreed temporary\r\ninjunction represented \"a compromise as to the scope of the injunctive relief granted, specifically\r\ndenying the relief requested by Appellees that Appellant not be permitted to continue production.\"<sup> (10)</sup> \r\nJet Stream directs us to language in the petition that Moore be enjoined from \"continuing to produce\r\nthe property . . . .\"  This language, however, is contained in paragraph VIII of Jet Stream's original\r\npetition which requests a permanent injunction.<sup> (11)</sup>  Paragraph IX of Jet Stream's original petition\r\nprovides as follows, in pertinent part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefendant should be cited to appear and show cause why he or it should not be\r\n<em>temporarily restrained</em>, during the pendency of this action, <em>from shutting in\r\nproduction of oil, gas or other minerals from the Property</em>, from removing the\r\nequipment or plugging the Wells located on the Property, from accepting the\r\nproceeds of sale for gas produced from the Property from any third party, and upon\r\nhearing, why a receiver should not be appointed to operate the Wells.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  As demonstrated by the quoted language, Jet Stream affirmatively requested in\r\nits original petition that production continue.<sup> (12)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note the Austin Court of Appeals has held a party cannot rely on a temporary injunction\r\nas evidence of good faith because a temporary injunction is merely intended to preserve the status\r\nquo.  <em>Rauch</em>, 905 S.W.2d at 410.  We agree with the Austin court that most temporary injunctions\r\nwill not be evidence of good faith.  This case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Rauch</em>.  The\r\ntemporary injunction in <em>Rauch</em> was not an agreed temporary injunction, and there is no indication\r\nthat the mineral owner affirmatively requested the operator be temporarily enjoined from ceasing\r\nproduction.  In this case, Jet Stream affirmatively requested production to continue in its original\r\npetition and agreed to a temporary injunction which was signed several months later.  In the\r\ntemporary injunction, Jet Stream agreed \"the Defendant is required to continue to operate the wells\r\nas has been operated in the past without any discontinuation of production.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMoore does not specify which form of estoppel should apply in this case.  We conclude\r\nquasi-estoppel is most applicable here.  The doctrine of quasi-estoppel precludes a party from\r\nasserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken.  <em>Lopez v.\r\nMunoz, Hockema &amp; Reed</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376524/lopez-v-munoz-hockema-reed-llp/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, 864 (Tex. 2000).  The doctrine applies when it would be\r\nunconscionable to allow a person to maintain a position inconsistent with one to which he or she\r\nacquiesced, or from which he or she accepted a benefit.  <em>See id.</em>; <em>Maguire Oil Co. v.

Moore should not be punished for the conduct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its response, Jet Stream also argues Moore failed to present any evidence regarding the\r\ncosts of production.  Moore testified the costs of production account for approximately sixty percent\r\nof gross revenues.  While Moore could have presented better evidence, Moore's testimony is more\r\nthan a scintilla of evidence.  There is some evidence of the value of the minerals minus drilling and\r\noperating costs.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJet Stream affirmatively requested, in its petition and in the agreed temporary injunction, that\r\nproduction continue.  As such, Jet Stream is estopped from seeking damages for bad faith trespass. \r\nJet Stream's recovery should be limited to damages for good faith trespass--the value of the minerals\r\nminus drilling and operating costs.  The trial court erred in awarding damages for bad faith trespass\r\nbased on gross revenues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>VIII.\tThe Evidence Supporting the Award for Underpayment of Royalties Is Sufficient</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his last point of error, Moore argues the only evidence concerning the underpayment of\r\nroyalties is hearsay and the evidence is insufficient.<sup> (13)</sup></span><span>  At trial, William L. Rudd, III, testified he\r\ncalculated the underpayment of royalties from a review of the Texas Railroad Commission reports\r\nposted online.  Rudd failed to testify how he made these calculations and failed to provide the proper\r\nfoundation for the online reports.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe admission and exclusion of evidence is committed to the trial court's sound discretion;\r\nthus, we review this issue under an abuse of discretion standard.  <em>City of Brownsville v.

Moore failed to object in the trial court to the evidence.  In fact, Moore stated he had\r\n\"no objection\" to the evidence.  Whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the hearsay\r\nis not preserved for appellate review.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven if the evidence is hearsay, we can consider, in an evidentiary sufficiency review,\r\nhearsay evidence admitted without an objection.<sup> (14)</sup></span><span> <em> Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 812 n.29; <em>see </em>Tex.

The test for legal sufficiency is \"whether the evidence at trial would\r\nenable reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.\" <em> Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d\r\nat 827.

As such, the fact that Moore prevailed on two issues<sup> (15)</sup> does not dictate that attorney's fees\r\nshould be awarded.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA reversal of the trial court's decision does not necessarily mean the award of attorney's fees\r\nwas an abuse of discretion.  <em>Sava Gumarska in Kemijska Industria D.D. v. Advanced Polymer Scis.,\r\nInc.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></span>, 324 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2004, no pet.).  Although, under the facts of this case,\r\nthe trial court's award would not be an abuse of discretion, the trial court might exercise its discretion\r\ndifferently in light of our opinion in this case.  When a judgment is reversed on appeal, the reversal\r\nmay affect whether the award of attorney's fees is equitable and just.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also Barshop</em>, 925\r\nS.W.2d at 637.  \"The trial court's decision whether to award attorney's fees in a declaratory judgment\r\ncase depends on the court's conclusion whether it is just and equitable to do so under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case . . . .\"  <em>In re Estate of Kuykendall</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span>, 772 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 2006, no pet.).  Because our opinion on rehearing might affect the trial court's\r\ndetermination, we will remand the award of attorney's fees to the trial court for a determination of\r\nwhether, in light of our opinion, the award is equitable and just.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe modify the trial court's judgment, affirm as modified in part, and reverse and remand in\r\npart.  We reverse the award of damages for bad faith trespass and remand that portion of the case to\r\nthe trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We also reverse the portion of\r\nthe judgment awarding attorney's fees to Jet Stream and remand this portion of the case to the trial\r\ncourt for a determination of whether, in light of our opinion, an award of such fees to Jet Stream is\r\n\"equitable and just.\"  We modify the trial court's judgment to remove the permanent injunction\r\nprohibiting Moore from removing his equipment, with the exception of the well casing, from the\r\nlease property.  As modified, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJack Carter</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tJustice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Date Submitted:\tAugust 7, 2008</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Date Decided:\t\tAugust 8, 2008</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <span>Moore states in his summary judgment affidavit that coverage was denied due to insufficient\r\nliquid collateral and the lack of general liability insurance, which he had never been required to\r\ncarry.  According to Moore, \"[i]n essence, I was rejected because I was too small an operator.\" \r\n<p>2. </p></span><span>Of the numerous copies of the lease introduced into the record, none of the copies contains\r\na complete legible copy of the statement at issue.  This quotation is the product of combining two\r\nincomplete copies of the lease.  We emphasize that the parties should make sure the record\r\naccurately reflects the entire document at issue--particularly the clauses being disputed.\r\n<p>3. </p></span><span>Moore argues in his brief:  \"[i]f Appellant is not entitled to defend Appellee's suit under the\r\nforce majeure clause as argument in Issue No. 1 above under the theory that he was diligent in\r\nmeeting the financial assurance requirements of the Railroad Commission, then he is entitled to a\r\ntrial on that issue.\"  Moore concludes the argument with the assertion that \"[i]f his diligence is an\r\nissue, Appellant should be able to try this issue and summary judgment should be deemed\r\ninappropriate because of this fact.\"  If Moore is raising the issue of due diligence in the context of\r\na defense other than the force-majeure clause, Moore's brief fails to specify what defense is being\r\nargued.  To the extent this argument can be interpreted as raising a defense other than the force-majeure clause, the argument is inadequately briefed. <em> See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Further, Moore\r\nhas failed to preserve any other defenses by raising them in the trial court.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\r\n<p>4. </p></span><span>The record contains a release dated April 1, 1952, from Phillips Petroleum Company in\r\nwhich Phillips surrenders all interest in the Perry Tract.  The parties have not directed us to where\r\nthe record contains evidence of how Phillips obtained its interest under the lease.  To the extent the\r\nbest evidence rule would require the introduction of the writing proving Phillips' interest, Moore\r\nwaived any error by failing to object in the trial court. <em> See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; Tex. R. Evid. 1002. \r\nMoore did not introduce any evidence contradicting Rudd's testimony.\r\n<p>5. </p></span><span>We note paragraph 5 of the lease contains two specific time limits:  a thirty-day provision\r\nand a sixty-day provision.  Jet Stream argues the thirty-day limit applies.  This opinion should not\r\nbe interpreted as holding the thirty-day provision applies to the facts of this case.  It is not necessary\r\nfor us to decide which specific time limit applies because it is uncontested that production ceased\r\nfor more than sixty days.  \r\n<p>6. </p></span><span>We note the Beaumont Court of Appeals has construed a similar provision and awarded the\r\nlessee forty acres around each producing well.  <em>Hunt Oil Co. v. Dishman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1680503\"><a href=\"/opinion/1680503/hunt-oil-company-v-dishman/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span> (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Beaumont 1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  <em>Hunt Oil</em>, though, is clearly distinguishable from the\r\ncurrent case.  In <em>Hunt Oil</em>, the lease was not terminated for lack of production and there were wells\r\nproducing when the lease terminated.  <em>Id</em>.\r\n<p>7. </p></span><span>Jet Stream did not object when Moore presented evidence concerning the value of the\r\noilfield equipment.  In its brief, Jet Stream alleges this issue was set for trial on the merits. \r\n<p>8. Moore presented the estoppel theory to the trial court in his arguments in support of his\r\nmotion for new trial. \r\n</p><p>9. \"When one enters into possession of land and makes improvements thereon with full\r\nknowledge of the pendency of an action to enforce an adverse claim to the premises, one is\r\nconclusively considered a trespasser in bad faith.\"  <em>Mayfield</em>, 693 S.W.2d at 504; <em>see Houston Prod.\r\nCo. v. Mecom Oil Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></span> (Tex.

App.--Austin 1995, writ denied).  <em>But see</em> <em>Byrom v. Pendley</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2461215\"><a href=\"/opinion/2461215/byrom-v-pendley/\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 604 (Tex. 1986) (no bad faith trespass when cotenant leases mineral rights).  \r\n</p><p>10. Jet Stream claims the \"agreement was that Appellant Moore is permitted to continue\r\nproduction, and the prevailing party to the litigation recovers the proceeds of production.\"  This\r\nargument, though, would require us to go outside the record for facts not in evidence.  This we\r\ndecline to do.\r\n</p><p>11. We note the relevant language in Jet Stream's amended petition is identical to Jet Stream's\r\noriginal petition.  Because the issue here is what position Jet Stream successfully requested, we will\r\nrefer to the original petition rather than the amended petition.\r\n</p><p>12. We note Jet Stream requested that a receiver be appointed to operate the wells.  While this\r\nis evidence that Jet Stream did not desire Moore to continue production, it indicates a desire not to\r\ncease production.  Further, as noted above, Jet Stream agreed to a temporary injunction requiring\r\nMoore to continue production.\r\n</p><p>13. </p></span><span>Although the record contains evidence that Moore accepted the reduced royalty payments\r\nand Moore complains that Jet Stream failed to introduce any of the division orders, Moore does not\r\nargue on appeal that Jet Stream is estopped from collecting underpayment of royalties.  Moore's\r\ncomplaint on appeal is limited to challenging the evidence introduced by Jet Stream.\r\n<p>14. </p></span><span>We note the Texas Supreme Court has stated, \"[i]t has long been the rule in Texas that\r\nincompetent evidence is legally insufficient to support a judgment, even if admitted without\r\nobjection.\"  <em>City of Keller v. Wilson</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span>, 812 &amp; n.29 (Tex. 2005).  On rehearing, Moore\r\nargues Rudd's testimony is incompetent because Rudd failed to introduce \"division orders or some\r\ntitle history of the royalties.\"  Moore has failed to cite any authority that such a failure would render\r\nthe testimony incompetent.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).\r\n<p>15. This Court has held the prevailing party is the party to the suit who successfully prosecutes\r\nthe action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the\r\nextent of its original contention.  <em>Flagship Hotel</em>, 117 S.W.3d at 564.  Moore is not the prevailing\r\nparty because he did not prevail on the main issue--the termination of the lease.\r\n\r\n</p></span></p></div>",
