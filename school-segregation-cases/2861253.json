Matthew Eric Mann entered a\nconditional guilty plea to one count of possessing child\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B). The\ndistrict court sentenced Mann to sixty-three months\nimprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised\nrelease. Police discovered evidence supporting the child\npornography charges while executing a warrant to\nsearch Mann’s computers and hard drives for the\n\f2                                            No. 08-3041\n\nunrelated crime of voyeurism. Mann preserved the right\nto appeal the district court’s denial of his motion to\nsuppress the child pornography on the grounds that\nthe search exceeded the scope of the warrant. Although\nwe are troubled by some aspects of the search, we ulti-\nmately conclude that, with one immaterial exception,\nthe officer executing the search did not exceed the scope\nof the original warrant.\n\n\n                           I.\n  While working as a life guard instructor in May 2007\nfor the Red Cross in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, Mann\ncovertly installed a video camera in the women’s locker\nroom to capture footage of women changing their\nclothes. Unfortunately for Mann, he also captured footage\nof himself installing the camera in an open locker. One\nof the female students in his class later discovered the\ncamera. She recognized Mann in the video when she\nrewound and viewed the tape. She and two other\nwomen in Mann’s class contacted the Lafayette Police\nDepartment and turned over the video camera and\nthe videotape.\n  Three days later, an Indiana state prosecutor sought\nand received a search warrant for officers to search\nMann’s residence for “video tapes, CD’s or other digital\nmedia, computers, and the contents of said computers,\ntapes, or other electronic media, to search for images of\nwomen in locker rooms or other private areas.” As\nrelevant here, officers executing the warrant seized a\nDell desktop computer with a Samsung hard drive, a\n\fNo. 08-3041                                             3\n\nDell laptop, an e-machine, and a Western Digital\nexternal hard drive. The following day officers arrested\nMann and charged him with voyeurism in violation of\nthe Indiana Code. See Ind. Code Ann. § 35-45-4-5(a)(2)-\n(b)(1) (defining voyeurism and making it a class D\nfelony when committed by means of any type of video\nrecording device).\n  Nearly two months later, at the end of July 2007, Detec-\ntive Paul Huff of the Lafayette Police Department began\nhis search of Mann’s computers. At the suppression\nhearing, Detective Huff testified that he searched the\ncomputers by first using a “write blocker” to protect the\nhard drives from being altered and then created an\nexact match of each hard drive. He then used software\nknown as “forensic tool kit” (“FTK”) to catalogue the\nimages on the computer into a viewable format.\nDetective Huff explained that once this indexing process\nusing FTK is completed, an “overview screen” is generated\nthat lets him know how many images, videos, and docu-\nments are on the computer and whether there are en-\ncrypted documents or files that may be ignored (such as\nprogram files). The overview screen also lists files\nflagged by the software as “KFF (Known File Filter)\nAlert” and “KFF Ignorable” files. The “KFF Alert” flags\nthose files identifiable from a library of known files\npreviously submitted by law enforcement—most of\nwhich are images of child pornography.\n  On the first computer, Detective Huff discovered evi-\ndence that Mann had visited a web site called “Perverts\nAre Us,” where he had read and possibly downloaded\n\f4                                              No. 08-3041\n\nstories about child molestation. On the Dell laptop, Detec-\ntive Huff uncovered still images taken in the Jefferson\nHigh school locker room, child pornography, and\nevidence that the Western Digital external hard drive\nhad been connected to the laptop. Detective Huff then\nsearched the final computer, where he again found child\npornography, along with a disturbing story (presumably\nwritten by Mann) about a swim coach masturbating\nwhile watching young girls swim.\n  It was not until nearly another two months later, on\nSeptember 18, 2007, that Detective Huff first searched the\nWestern Digital external hard drive. As with the other\ncomputers, Detective Huff used FTK to index the\ncontents of the hard drive. The FTK software identified\nfour “KFF Alert” files and 677 “flagged thumbnails.”\nDetective Huff proceeded to open the files on the\ncomputer and discovered “many, many images of child\npornography” as well as two videos from the Jefferson\nHigh School locker room.\n  Mann moved in the district court to suppress all of the\nevidence seized from his home and computers as a\nresult of the May 2007 warrant, arguing that the\nwarrant lacked probable cause and that the executing\nofficers exceeded the scope of the warrant’s authorization.\nThe district court denied Mann’s motion, concluding\nthat the magistrate judge had probable cause to issue\nthe warrant based on the evidence of Mann’s voyeurism\nat Jefferson High School and the probability that Mann\npossessed evidence of his crime at his residence. The\ndistrict court also rejected Mann’s claim that the\n\fNo. 08-3041                                                  5\n\nexecuting officers had exceeded the scope of the warrant\nwhen they opened the files containing child pornogra-\nphy. Specifically, the district court found as a factual\nmatter that Detective Huff believed the search warrant\nauthorized him to examine any digital file located on the\ncomputer hard drives or storage devices and that he never\nabandoned his search for evidence of voyeurism and began\nlooking for child pornography. The court ultimately\nconcluded that “with limited exceptions” the search was\nwithin the scope of the warrant, and that any images\nuncovered outside the scope of the warrant were discov-\nered in plain view. Mann then entered a conditional guilty\nplea to the one count of possession of child pornography in\nthe indictment, reserving his right to challenge on appeal\nthe district court’s denial of his motion to suppress.\n\n\n                              II.\n  On appeal, Mann maintains that the district court\nerred by denying his motion to suppress. In particular,\nMann claims that the searches that uncovered the child\npornography on his computer exceeded the scope of the\noriginal warrant and that the plain view doctrine does not\napply on these facts. The government insists that the\nsearches did not exceed the scope of the original war-\nrant, and that the incriminating child pornography was\nin any event discovered in plain view. When reviewing\na motion to suppress, we review the district court’s\nlegal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for\nclear error. E.g., United States v. Marrocco, 578 F.3d 627, 632\n(7th Cir. 2009).\n\f6                                               No. 08-3041\n\n  We begin with Mann’s contention that Detective\nHuff’s search of the computers exceeded the scope of the\nwarrant. The Fourth Amendment requires that a\nwarrant describe the things to be seized with sufficient\nparticularity to prevent a general exploratory rum-\nmaging through one’s belongings. See, e.g., Marron v. United\nStates, 275 U.S. 192, 196 (1927) (“The requirement that\nwarrants shall particularly describe the things to be\nseized makes general searches under them impossible\nand prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant\ndescribing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is\nleft to the discretion of the officer executing the war-\nrant.”). The description of items to be seized limits the\nscope of the search to areas where those items are likely\nto be discovered. Platteville Area Ap’t. Ass. v. City of\nPlatteville, 179 F.3d 574, 579 (7th Cir. 1999). Thus, our\nquestion is whether, in light of the limitations in the\nwarrant, the execution of the search was reasonable—the\ntouchstone for all Fourth Amendment inquiries. Id.; see\nalso Ill. v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 330 (2001).\n   Mann maintains that given the warrant’s directive to\nsearch in those places likely to contain “images of\nwomen in locker rooms and other private places,” it was\nunreasonable for Detective Huff to employ the FTK\nsoftware and its accompanying “KFF Alert” system, which\nordinarily identifies files containing child pornography.\nUndoubtedly the warrant’s description serves as a limita-\ntion on what files may reasonably be searched. The prob-\nlem with applying this principle to computer searches\nlies in the fact that such images could be nearly any-\nwhere on the computers. Unlike a physical object that\n\fNo. 08-3041                                              7\n\ncan be immediately identified as responsive to the\nwarrant or not, computer files may be manipulated to\nhide their true contents. See United States v. Hill, 459\nF.3d 966, 978 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Images can be hidden in\nall manner of files, even word processing documents\nand spreadsheets. Criminals will do all they can to\nconceal contraband, including the simple expedient of\nchanging the names and extensions of files to disguise\ntheir content from the casual observer.”).\n  So although the officers were limited by the warrant to\na search likely to yield “images of women in locker\nrooms and other private places,” those images could be\nessentially anywhere on the computer. Detective Huff\ntestified at the suppression hearing that “[r]egardless of\nwhat I found, I would search in all the files if I felt it\nnecessary, if I felt that it contained information that was\npertinent to my case or even exculpatory.” Thus, the\ngovernment’s argument goes, Detective Huff was at all\nrelevant times searching for the type of image detailed\nin the warrant, and the fact that he uncovered child\npornography does not invalidate the lawful search.\n  Mann, however, maintains that Detective Huff ignored\nthe limitations in the warrant and instead conducted a\ngeneral search for crimes unrelated to voyeurism. Mann\nrelies heavily on a Tenth Circuit decision, United States\nv. Carey, 172 F.3d 1268 (10th Cir. 1999), for the proposi-\ntion that the seizure of the child pornography on his\ncomputer was unauthorized. In Carey, police obtained a\nwarrant to search the defendant’s computers for “ ‘names,\ntelephone numbers, ledger receipts, addresses and other\n\f8                                              No. 08-3041\n\ndocumentary evidence pertaining to the sale and dis-\ntribution of controlled substances.’ ” Carey, 172 F.3d at\n1270. After unsuccessfully searching the computers’ text\nfiles using key words such as “money” and “accounts,” the\nofficers searched the directories and downloaded and\nthen opened JPG (image) files containing child pornogra-\nphy. After opening the first JPG file and finding child\npornography, the officer in Carey “continued to open\nevery JPG file to confirm his expectations” of finding\nchild pornography. Id. at 1273. The Tenth Circuit con-\ncluded that the seized images of child pornography\nwere neither authorized by the warrant nor found in\nplain view. Rather than delve into the “intriguing” ques-\ntion of “what constitutes ‘plain view’ in the context of\ncomputer files,” the panel judged the case “only by its\nown facts.” Id. The panel concluded that discovery of\nthe child pornography was not “inadvertent” as\nrequired by the plain view doctrine, and that by looking\nfor child pornography in the JPG files on the computer\nthe officer exceeded the scope of the warrant and executed\nan unconstitutional general search. Id. at 1276.\n  More recently, the Tenth Circuit decided United States\nv. Burgess, 576 F.3d 1078 (10th Cir. 2009), where the court\nupheld the admission of child pornography discovered\non the defendant’s computer when officers were\nexecuting a warrant to search his motor home and com-\nputer records for evidence of transportation and\ndelivery of controlled substances, id. at 1088-89. In\nBurgess, the court reiterated that “the Carey holding was\nlimited.” Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1092. The court in Burgess\nnoted specifically that both the majority and the\n\fNo. 08-3041                                              9\n\nconcurring opinions in Carey “were careful to warn that\nthe case was fact intense.” Id. (citing Carey, 172 F.3d at\n1276); see also Carey, 172 F.3d at 1276 (emphasizing that\n“the questions presented in this case are extremely\nclose calls and, in my opinion, are totally fact driven”)\n(Baldock, J., concurring).\n  In particular, the court in Carey premised its holding on\na few key facts that are absent here. First, the warrant in\nCarey authorized a search of the computer solely for\n“documentary” evidence of drug dealing; thus, the\ncourt found it significant that officers downloaded and\nviewed numerous image files containing child pornogra-\nphy. Id. at 1271, 1273 (noting that “scope of the search\nwas . . . circumscribed to evidence pertaining to drug\ntrafficking”). In contrast, Officer Mann was searching for\n“images” of women—a type of file that he could not\nsearch thoroughly for without stumbling upon Mann’s\nextensive collection of child pornography. In this\nrespect, the search of Mann’s computer more closely\nresembles the search in Wong, where the Ninth Circuit\nupheld the denial of a motion to suppress child pornogra-\nphy found on a defendant’s computer incident to a\nmurder investigation. United States v. Wong, 334 F.3d\n831 (9th Cir. 2003). There, the court concluded that the\nofficer was within the scope of the warrant to search\nfor evidence pertaining to a murder investigation when\nhe opened images of child pornography, made a note of\nthe files’ location, and continued with his search for\nevidence relating to the murder. Id. at 835, 837-38.\n  Second, the court in Carey found as a factual matter\nthat the officer conducting the search “made clear as he\n\f10                                            No. 08-3041\n\nopened each of the JPG files he was not looking for evi-\ndence of drug trafficking” and had “abandoned that\nsearch to look for more child pornography.” Carey, 172\nF.3d at 1273. In contrast, the district court here in its\nfactual findings credited Detective Huff’s testimony that\nat all times during the search, “I continued to look for\nitems with voyeurism, and as I came across the child\npornography, then I would not ignore it obviously.” Thus,\nDetective Huff’s actions are much closer to the detective\nin Wong, who discovered child pornography as he\nsearched for items within the scope of the original\nwarrant for evidence tied to a murder investigation. See\nWong, 334 F.3d at 838; see also United States v. Gray, 78\nF. Supp.2d 524, 529 (E.D. Va. 1999) (“In searching for the\nitems listed in the warrant, Agent Ehuan was entitled to\nexamine all of defendant’s files to determine whether\nthey contained items that fell within the scope of the\nwarrant. In the course of doing so, he inadvertently\ndiscovered evidence of child pornography, which was\nclearly incriminating on its face.”). And although intent\nis not generally relevant when assessing whether a given\nsearch falls within the scope of the warrant, Platteville,\n179 F.3d at 580, Detective Huff’s focus on finding\nimages related to the voyeurism charges serves to\nfurther distinguish this case from Carey. Compare Carey,\n172 F.3d at 1273 (noting that searching detective knew\nhe was expanding scope of search and had abandoned\nthe drug-related search to search for more child pornogra-\nphy) with Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1092 (upholding search\nwhere officer “was only looking for ‘trophy photos’ when\nhe came upon the child pornography”); see also Gray, 78\n\fNo. 08-3041                                               11\n\nF. Supp.2d at 527 (agent opened subdirectory entitled\n“Tiny Teen” not “because he believed it might contain\nchild pornography, but rather because it was the next\nsubdirectory listed and he was opening all of the sub-\ndirectories as part of his routine search for the items\nlisted in the warrant”).\n   Additionally, we note that Mann’s primary complaint\nwith Detective Huff’s search—that he used FTK software\nemploying a filter and viewed those files flagged with the\n“KFF Alert”—does not impact the outcome here. First,\nas to the use of the filtering software itself, Detective\nHuff used it to index and catalogue the files into a\nviewable format. Given the nature of Detective Huff’s\nsearch and the fact that Mann could have images of\nwomen in locker rooms virtually anywhere on his com-\nputers, there is no reason to believe that Detective\nHuff exceeded the scope of the warrant by employing\nthe FTK software without more. But see United States v.\nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 579 F.3d 989, 999 (9th Cir.\n2009) (admonishing that government’s “sophisticated\nhashing tools . . . that allow the identification of well-\nknown illegal files . . . and similar search tools may not\nbe used without specific authorization in the warrant”).\nThe same cannot be said of the four flagged “KFF Alert”\nfiles. Once those files had been flagged, Detective Huff\nknew (or should have known) that files in a database\nof known child pornography images would be outside\nthe scope of the warrant to search for images of women\nin locker rooms—presumably images that Mann himself\nhad captured. Unfortunately for Mann, suppressing those\nfour images has no impact on the outcome here. Without\n\f12                                                No. 08-3041\n\nthose images, the government still possessed ample\nevidence of child pornography to sustain both Mann’s\nconviction and sentence. Although we hold that Officer\nHuff exceeded the scope of the warrant by opening the\nfour flagged “KFF Alert” files, those files are severable\nfrom the remaining files seized. See United States v.\nBuckley, 4 F.3d 552, 557-58 (7th Cir. 1993). We thus\nreject Mann’s suggestion that all of the evidence of child\npornography should be suppressed because Officer\nHuff exceeded the authorization of the warrant when\nopening the “KFF Alert” files.\n  We also reject Mann’s suggestion that we take our cue\nfrom the more comprehensive rules regarding computer\nsearches recently outlined by the Ninth Circuit. In\nUnited States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., an\nen banc panel of the Ninth Circuit rejected the govern-\nment’s attempt to justify its seizure of drug testing\nrecords for hundreds of Major League Baseball Players\ndespite a warrant authorizing the seizure of only ten\nplayers’ records. 579 F.3d 989, 993, 1000 (9th Cir. 2009).1\nIn so doing, the Ninth Circuit laid down a series of rules\nto address the difficulties posed by searches and\nseizures of digital media. The court set forth the\nfollowing guidelines applicable when officers conduct\ncomputer searches and seizures. First, the opinion directs\n\n\n1\n  The Ninth Circuit recently (November 4, 2009) entered an\norder asking the parties in this case to brief the question of\nwhether the case should be reheard by the full en banc court\n(comprised of all active judges as opposed to the 11 ordinarily\nselected randomly for standard en banc review).\n\fNo. 08-3041                                              13\n\nmagistrate judges to insist that the government\nwaive reliance on the plain view doctrine. See Comprehen-\nsive Drug Testing, 579 F.3d at 998, 1006. Second, the\nwarrant application should include protocol “for pre-\nventing agents involved in the investigation from ex-\namining or retaining any data other than that for\nwhich probable cause is shown”—preferably by\nrequiring segregation to be done by specially trained\ncomputer personnel unconnected to the investigation\nwho agree not to “communicate any information they\nlearn during the segregation process absent further ap-\nproval of the court.” Id. at 1000. Third, the government\nmust use search protocol tailored to uncover only infor-\nmation for which it has probable cause. Id. at 999-1001,\n1006. Finally, the government must either destroy or\nreturn any non-responsive data and inform the\nmagistrate what it has kept, destroyed, or returned. Id. at\n1000-01, 1006.\n  Mann urges us to apply the Ninth Circuit’s rationale\nto conclude that Detective Huff’s search was unconstitu-\ntional. Although the Ninth Circuit’s rules provide some\nguidance in a murky area, we are inclined to find more\ncommon ground with the dissent’s position that\njettisoning the plain view doctrine entirely in digital\nevidence cases is an “efficient but overbroad approach.” Id.\nat 1013 (Callahan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). As the dissent recognizes, there is nothing in the\nSupreme Court’s case law (or the Ninth Circuit’s for\nthat matter) counseling the complete abandonment of\nthe plain view doctrine in digital evidence cases. Id. We\ntoo believe the more considered approach “would be to\n\f14                                            No. 08-3041\n\nallow the countours of the plain view doctrine to\ndevelop incrementally through the normal course of fact-\nbased case adjudication.” Id. We are also skeptical of a\nrule requiring officers to always obtain pre-approval\nfrom a magistrate judge to use the electronic tools neces-\nsary to conduct searches tailored to uncovering\nevidence that is responsive to a properly circumscribed\nwarrant.\n  Instead, we simply counsel officers and others involved\nin searches of digital media to exercise caution to\nensure that warrants describe with particularity the\nthings to be seized and that searches are narrowly\ntailored to uncover only those things described. As dis-\ncussed above, with the exception of the four “KFF Alert”\nimages, Detective Huff’s search was indeed targeted to\nuncovering evidence of voyeurism as described in what\nMann now concedes was a lawful warrant.2 In so doing,\nhe uncovered obvious evidence of child pornography.\nAlthough we now hold that his actions were within\nthe scope of the warrant, we emphasize that his failure\nto stop his search and request a separate warrant for\nchild pornography is troubling. Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1095\n(noting that when searching detective “observed a\npossible criminal violation outside the scope of the war-\nrant’s search authorization” he “immediately closed the\ngallery view . . . and did not renew the search until he\n\n\n\n2\n  Although Mann argued in the district court that the\nwarrant lacked probable cause, he has since abandoned that\nchallenge.\n\fNo. 08-3041                                           15\n\nobtained a new warrant”). Because Detective Huff\nwas not in a rapidly unfolding situation or searching a\nlocation where evidence was likely to move or change,\nthere was no downside to halting the search to obtain\na second warrant. Indeed, we find it problematic that\nnearly two months elapsed before Detective Huff began\nhis search of the Western Digital hard drive despite\nhaving found child pornography on the Dell laptop.\nHowever, notwithstanding our distaste for the timeline\nof the investigation, we conclude that the original\nwarrant authorized Detective Huff’s search of the\nexternal hard drive for images of voyeurism. Given this,\nwe ultimately conclude that, with the exception of the\nfour “KFF alert” images, the search was lawful, particu-\nlarly since Detective Huff did indeed uncover further\nevidence of voyeurism on the external hard drive.\nBecause Detective Huff discovered the child pornography\nwhile conducting a systematic search for evidence of\nvoyeurism, we conclude that his actions were reasonable\nand within the scope of the warrant’s authorization.

Grimmett, 439 F.3d 1263, 1270 (10th Cir.\n2006) (recognizing that computer search may be “‘as\nextensive as reasonably required to locate the items\ndescribed in the warrant.’ ” (quoting United States v.\nWuagneux, 683 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir. 1982))).\n  For the foregoing reasons we A FFIRM the judgment of\nthe district court denying Mann’s motion to suppress.\n\n\n\n                         1-20-10\n\f",

Matthew Eric Mann entered a\nconditional guilty plea to one count of possessing child\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B). The\ndistrict court sentenced Mann to sixty-three months\nimprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised\nrelease. Police discovered evidence supporting the child\npornography charges while executing a warrant to\nsearch Mann’s computers and hard drives for the\n\f2                                            No. 08-3041\n\nunrelated crime of voyeurism. Mann preserved the right\nto appeal the district court’s denial of his motion to\nsuppress the child pornography on the grounds that\nthe search exceeded the scope of the warrant. Although\nwe are troubled by some aspects of the search, we ulti-\nmately conclude that, with one immaterial exception,\nthe officer executing the search did not exceed the scope\nof the original warrant.\n\n\n                           I.\n  While working as a life guard instructor in May 2007\nfor the Red Cross in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, Mann\ncovertly installed a video camera in the women’s locker\nroom to capture footage of women changing their\nclothes. Unfortunately for Mann, he also captured footage\nof himself installing the camera in an open locker. One\nof the female students in his class later discovered the\ncamera. She recognized Mann in the video when she\nrewound and viewed the tape. She and two other\nwomen in Mann’s class contacted the Lafayette Police\nDepartment and turned over the video camera and\nthe videotape.\n  Three days later, an Indiana state prosecutor sought\nand received a search warrant for officers to search\nMann’s residence for “video tapes, CD’s or other digital\nmedia, computers, and the contents of said computers,\ntapes, or other electronic media, to search for images of\nwomen in locker rooms or other private areas.” As\nrelevant here, officers executing the warrant seized a\nDell desktop computer with a Samsung hard drive, a\n\fNo. 08-3041                                             3\n\nDell laptop, an e-machine, and a Western Digital\nexternal hard drive. The following day officers arrested\nMann and charged him with voyeurism in violation of\nthe Indiana Code. See Ind. Code Ann. § 35-45-4-5(a)(2)-\n(b)(1) (defining voyeurism and making it a class D\nfelony when committed by means of any type of video\nrecording device).\n  Nearly two months later, at the end of July 2007, Detec-\ntive Paul Huff of the Lafayette Police Department began\nhis search of Mann’s computers. At the suppression\nhearing, Detective Huff testified that he searched the\ncomputers by first using a “write blocker” to protect the\nhard drives from being altered and then created an\nexact match of each hard drive. He then used software\nknown as “forensic tool kit” (“FTK”) to catalogue the\nimages on the computer into a viewable format.\nDetective Huff explained that once this indexing process\nusing FTK is completed, an “overview screen” is generated\nthat lets him know how many images, videos, and docu-\nments are on the computer and whether there are en-\ncrypted documents or files that may be ignored (such as\nprogram files). The overview screen also lists files\nflagged by the software as “KFF (Known File Filter)\nAlert” and “KFF Ignorable” files. The “KFF Alert” flags\nthose files identifiable from a library of known files\npreviously submitted by law enforcement—most of\nwhich are images of child pornography.\n  On the first computer, Detective Huff discovered evi-\ndence that Mann had visited a web site called “Perverts\nAre Us,” where he had read and possibly downloaded\n\f4                                              No. 08-3041\n\nstories about child molestation. On the Dell laptop, Detec-\ntive Huff uncovered still images taken in the Jefferson\nHigh school locker room, child pornography, and\nevidence that the Western Digital external hard drive\nhad been connected to the laptop. Detective Huff then\nsearched the final computer, where he again found child\npornography, along with a disturbing story (presumably\nwritten by Mann) about a swim coach masturbating\nwhile watching young girls swim.\n  It was not until nearly another two months later, on\nSeptember 18, 2007, that Detective Huff first searched the\nWestern Digital external hard drive. As with the other\ncomputers, Detective Huff used FTK to index the\ncontents of the hard drive. The FTK software identified\nfour “KFF Alert” files and 677 “flagged thumbnails.”\nDetective Huff proceeded to open the files on the\ncomputer and discovered “many, many images of child\npornography” as well as two videos from the Jefferson\nHigh School locker room.\n  Mann moved in the district court to suppress all of the\nevidence seized from his home and computers as a\nresult of the May 2007 warrant, arguing that the\nwarrant lacked probable cause and that the executing\nofficers exceeded the scope of the warrant’s authorization.\nThe district court denied Mann’s motion, concluding\nthat the magistrate judge had probable cause to issue\nthe warrant based on the evidence of Mann’s voyeurism\nat Jefferson High School and the probability that Mann\npossessed evidence of his crime at his residence. The\ndistrict court also rejected Mann’s claim that the\n\fNo. 08-3041                                                  5\n\nexecuting officers had exceeded the scope of the warrant\nwhen they opened the files containing child pornogra-\nphy. Specifically, the district court found as a factual\nmatter that Detective Huff believed the search warrant\nauthorized him to examine any digital file located on the\ncomputer hard drives or storage devices and that he never\nabandoned his search for evidence of voyeurism and began\nlooking for child pornography. The court ultimately\nconcluded that “with limited exceptions” the search was\nwithin the scope of the warrant, and that any images\nuncovered outside the scope of the warrant were discov-\nered in plain view. Mann then entered a conditional guilty\nplea to the one count of possession of child pornography in\nthe indictment, reserving his right to challenge on appeal\nthe district court’s denial of his motion to suppress.\n\n\n                              II.\n  On appeal, Mann maintains that the district court\nerred by denying his motion to suppress. In particular,\nMann claims that the searches that uncovered the child\npornography on his computer exceeded the scope of the\noriginal warrant and that the plain view doctrine does not\napply on these facts. The government insists that the\nsearches did not exceed the scope of the original war-\nrant, and that the incriminating child pornography was\nin any event discovered in plain view. When reviewing\na motion to suppress, we review the district court’s\nlegal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for\nclear error. E.g., United States v. Marrocco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456522/united-states-v-marrocco/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632\n(7th Cir. 2009).\n\f6                                               No. 08-3041\n\n  We begin with Mann’s contention that Detective\nHuff’s search of the computers exceeded the scope of the\nwarrant. The Fourth Amendment requires that a\nwarrant describe the things to be seized with sufficient\nparticularity to prevent a general exploratory rum-\nmaging through one’s belongings. See, e.g., Marron v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101164\"><a href=\"/opinion/101164/marron-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (1927) (“The requirement that\nwarrants shall particularly describe the things to be\nseized makes general searches under them impossible\nand prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant\ndescribing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is\nleft to the discretion of the officer executing the war-\nrant.”). The description of items to be seized limits the\nscope of the search to areas where those items are likely\nto be discovered. Platteville Area Ap’t. Ass. v. City of\nPlatteville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764714\"><a href=\"/opinion/764714/platteville-area-apartment-association-v-city-of-platteville/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 (7th Cir. 1999). Thus, our\nquestion is whether, in light of the limitations in the\nwarrant, the execution of the search was reasonable—the\ntouchstone for all Fourth Amendment inquiries. Id.; see\nalso Ill. v. McArthur, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118405\"><a href=\"/opinion/118405/illinois-v-mcarthur/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (2001).\n   Mann maintains that given the warrant’s directive to\nsearch in those places likely to contain “images of\nwomen in locker rooms and other private places,” it was\nunreasonable for Detective Huff to employ the FTK\nsoftware and its accompanying “KFF Alert” system, which\nordinarily identifies files containing child pornography.\nUndoubtedly the warrant’s description serves as a limita-\ntion on what files may reasonably be searched. The prob-\nlem with applying this principle to computer searches\nlies in the fact that such images could be nearly any-\nwhere on the computers. Unlike a physical object that\n\fNo. 08-3041                                              7\n\ncan be immediately identified as responsive to the\nwarrant or not, computer files may be manipulated to\nhide their true contents. See United States v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795398\"><a href=\"/opinion/795398/united-states-v-justin-barrett-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 978 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Images can be hidden in\nall manner of files, even word processing documents\nand spreadsheets. Criminals will do all they can to\nconceal contraband, including the simple expedient of\nchanging the names and extensions of files to disguise\ntheir content from the casual observer.”).\n  So although the officers were limited by the warrant to\na search likely to yield “images of women in locker\nrooms and other private places,” those images could be\nessentially anywhere on the computer. Detective Huff\ntestified at the suppression hearing that “[r]egardless of\nwhat I found, I would search in all the files if I felt it\nnecessary, if I felt that it contained information that was\npertinent to my case or even exculpatory.” Thus, the\ngovernment’s argument goes, Detective Huff was at all\nrelevant times searching for the type of image detailed\nin the warrant, and the fact that he uncovered child\npornography does not invalidate the lawful search.\n  Mann, however, maintains that Detective Huff ignored\nthe limitations in the warrant and instead conducted a\ngeneral search for crimes unrelated to voyeurism. Mann\nrelies heavily on a Tenth Circuit decision, United States\nv. Carey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763086\"><a href=\"/opinion/763086/united-states-v-patrick-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1999), for the proposi-\ntion that the seizure of the child pornography on his\ncomputer was unauthorized. In Carey, police obtained a\nwarrant to search the defendant’s computers for “ ‘names,\ntelephone numbers, ledger receipts, addresses and other\n\f8                                              No. 08-3041\n\ndocumentary evidence pertaining to the sale and dis-\ntribution of controlled substances.’ ” Carey, 172 F.3d at\n1270. After unsuccessfully searching the computers’ text\nfiles using key words such as “money” and “accounts,” the\nofficers searched the directories and downloaded and\nthen opened JPG (image) files containing child pornogra-\nphy. After opening the first JPG file and finding child\npornography, the officer in Carey “continued to open\nevery JPG file to confirm his expectations” of finding\nchild pornography. Id. at 1273. The Tenth Circuit con-\ncluded that the seized images of child pornography\nwere neither authorized by the warrant nor found in\nplain view. Rather than delve into the “intriguing” ques-\ntion of “what constitutes ‘plain view’ in the context of\ncomputer files,” the panel judged the case “only by its\nown facts.” Id. The panel concluded that discovery of\nthe child pornography was not “inadvertent” as\nrequired by the plain view doctrine, and that by looking\nfor child pornography in the JPG files on the computer\nthe officer exceeded the scope of the warrant and executed\nan unconstitutional general search. Id. at 1276.\n  More recently, the Tenth Circuit decided United States\nv. Burgess, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172511\"><a href=\"/opinion/172511/united-states-v-burgess/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2009), where the court\nupheld the admission of child pornography discovered\non the defendant’s computer when officers were\nexecuting a warrant to search his motor home and com-\nputer records for evidence of transportation and\ndelivery of controlled substances, id. at 1088-89. In\nBurgess, the court reiterated that “the Carey holding was\nlimited.” Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1092. The court in Burgess\nnoted specifically that both the majority and the\n\fNo. 08-3041                                              9\n\nconcurring opinions in Carey “were careful to warn that\nthe case was fact intense.” Id. (citing Carey, 172 F.3d at\n1276); see also Carey, 172 F.3d at 1276 (emphasizing that\n“the questions presented in this case are extremely\nclose calls and, in my opinion, are totally fact driven”)\n(Baldock, J., concurring).\n  In particular, the court in Carey premised its holding on\na few key facts that are absent here. First, the warrant in\nCarey authorized a search of the computer solely for\n“documentary” evidence of drug dealing; thus, the\ncourt found it significant that officers downloaded and\nviewed numerous image files containing child pornogra-\nphy. Id. at 1271, 1273 (noting that “scope of the search\nwas . . . circumscribed to evidence pertaining to drug\ntrafficking”). In contrast, Officer Mann was searching for\n“images” of women—a type of file that he could not\nsearch thoroughly for without stumbling upon Mann’s\nextensive collection of child pornography. In this\nrespect, the search of Mann’s computer more closely\nresembles the search in Wong, where the Ninth Circuit\nupheld the denial of a motion to suppress child pornogra-\nphy found on a defendant’s computer incident to a\nmurder investigation. United States v. Wong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782563\"><a href=\"/opinion/782563/united-states-v-raymond-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2003). There, the court concluded that the\nofficer was within the scope of the warrant to search\nfor evidence pertaining to a murder investigation when\nhe opened images of child pornography, made a note of\nthe files’ location, and continued with his search for\nevidence relating to the murder. Id. at 835, 837-38.\n  Second, the court in Carey found as a factual matter\nthat the officer conducting the search “made clear as he\n\f10                                            No. 08-3041\n\nopened each of the JPG files he was not looking for evi-\ndence of drug trafficking” and had “abandoned that\nsearch to look for more child pornography.” Carey, 172\nF.3d at 1273. In contrast, the district court here in its\nfactual findings credited Detective Huff’s testimony that\nat all times during the search, “I continued to look for\nitems with voyeurism, and as I came across the child\npornography, then I would not ignore it obviously.” Thus,\nDetective Huff’s actions are much closer to the detective\nin Wong, who discovered child pornography as he\nsearched for items within the scope of the original\nwarrant for evidence tied to a murder investigation. See\nWong, 334 F.3d at 838; see also United States v. Gray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568986\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568986/united-states-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (E.D. Va. 1999) (“In searching for the\nitems listed in the warrant, Agent Ehuan was entitled to\nexamine all of defendant’s files to determine whether\nthey contained items that fell within the scope of the\nwarrant. In the course of doing so, he inadvertently\ndiscovered evidence of child pornography, which was\nclearly incriminating on its face.”). And although intent\nis not generally relevant when assessing whether a given\nsearch falls within the scope of the warrant, Platteville,\n179 F.3d at 580, Detective Huff’s focus on finding\nimages related to the voyeurism charges serves to\nfurther distinguish this case from Carey. Compare Carey,\n172 F.3d at 1273 (noting that searching detective knew\nhe was expanding scope of search and had abandoned\nthe drug-related search to search for more child pornogra-\nphy) with Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1092 (upholding search\nwhere officer “was only looking for ‘trophy photos’ when\nhe came upon the child pornography”); see also Gray, 78\n\fNo. 08-3041                                               11\n\nF. Supp.2d at 527 (agent opened subdirectory entitled\n“Tiny Teen” not “because he believed it might contain\nchild pornography, but rather because it was the next\nsubdirectory listed and he was opening all of the sub-\ndirectories as part of his routine search for the items\nlisted in the warrant”).\n   Additionally, we note that Mann’s primary complaint\nwith Detective Huff’s search—that he used FTK software\nemploying a filter and viewed those files flagged with the\n“KFF Alert”—does not impact the outcome here. First,\nas to the use of the filtering software itself, Detective\nHuff used it to index and catalogue the files into a\nviewable format. Given the nature of Detective Huff’s\nsearch and the fact that Mann could have images of\nwomen in locker rooms virtually anywhere on his com-\nputers, there is no reason to believe that Detective\nHuff exceeded the scope of the warrant by employing\nthe FTK software without more. But see United States v.\nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1358518\"><a href=\"/opinion/1358518/united-states-v-comprehensive-drug-testing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999 (9th Cir.\n2009) (admonishing that government’s “sophisticated\nhashing tools . . . that allow the identification of well-\nknown illegal files . . . and similar search tools may not\nbe used without specific authorization in the warrant”).\nThe same cannot be said of the four flagged “KFF Alert”\nfiles. Once those files had been flagged, Detective Huff\nknew (or should have known) that files in a database\nof known child pornography images would be outside\nthe scope of the warrant to search for images of women\nin locker rooms—presumably images that Mann himself\nhad captured. Unfortunately for Mann, suppressing those\nfour images has no impact on the outcome here. Without\n\f12                                                No. 08-3041\n\nthose images, the government still possessed ample\nevidence of child pornography to sustain both Mann’s\nconviction and sentence. Although we hold that Officer\nHuff exceeded the scope of the warrant by opening the\nfour flagged “KFF Alert” files, those files are severable\nfrom the remaining files seized. See United States v.\nBuckley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629183\"><a href=\"/opinion/629183/united-states-v-kim-m-buckley-and-mark-r-herman/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557-58 (7th Cir. 1993). We thus\nreject Mann’s suggestion that all of the evidence of child\npornography should be suppressed because Officer\nHuff exceeded the authorization of the warrant when\nopening the “KFF Alert” files.\n  We also reject Mann’s suggestion that we take our cue\nfrom the more comprehensive rules regarding computer\nsearches recently outlined by the Ninth Circuit. In\nUnited States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., an\nen banc panel of the Ninth Circuit rejected the govern-\nment’s attempt to justify its seizure of drug testing\nrecords for hundreds of Major League Baseball Players\ndespite a warrant authorizing the seizure of only ten\nplayers’ records. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1358518\"><a href=\"/opinion/1358518/united-states-v-comprehensive-drug-testing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 993, 1000 (9th Cir. 2009).1\nIn so doing, the Ninth Circuit laid down a series of rules\nto address the difficulties posed by searches and\nseizures of digital media. The court set forth the\nfollowing guidelines applicable when officers conduct\ncomputer searches and seizures. First, the opinion directs\n\n\n1\n  The Ninth Circuit recently (November 4, 2009) entered an\norder asking the parties in this case to brief the question of\nwhether the case should be reheard by the full en banc court\n(comprised of all active judges as opposed to the 11 ordinarily\nselected randomly for standard en banc review).\n\fNo. 08-3041                                              13\n\nmagistrate judges to insist that the government\nwaive reliance on the plain view doctrine. See Comprehen-\nsive Drug Testing, 579 F.3d at 998, 1006. Second, the\nwarrant application should include protocol “for pre-\nventing agents involved in the investigation from ex-\namining or retaining any data other than that for\nwhich probable cause is shown”—preferably by\nrequiring segregation to be done by specially trained\ncomputer personnel unconnected to the investigation\nwho agree not to “communicate any information they\nlearn during the segregation process absent further ap-\nproval of the court.” Id. at 1000. Third, the government\nmust use search protocol tailored to uncover only infor-\nmation for which it has probable cause. Id. at 999-1001,\n1006. Finally, the government must either destroy or\nreturn any non-responsive data and inform the\nmagistrate what it has kept, destroyed, or returned. Id. at\n1000-01, 1006.\n  Mann urges us to apply the Ninth Circuit’s rationale\nto conclude that Detective Huff’s search was unconstitu-\ntional. Although the Ninth Circuit’s rules provide some\nguidance in a murky area, we are inclined to find more\ncommon ground with the dissent’s position that\njettisoning the plain view doctrine entirely in digital\nevidence cases is an “efficient but overbroad approach.” Id.\nat 1013 (Callahan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). As the dissent recognizes, there is nothing in the\nSupreme Court’s case law (or the Ninth Circuit’s for\nthat matter) counseling the complete abandonment of\nthe plain view doctrine in digital evidence cases. Id. We\ntoo believe the more considered approach “would be to\n\f14                                            No. 08-3041\n\nallow the countours of the plain view doctrine to\ndevelop incrementally through the normal course of fact-\nbased case adjudication.” Id. We are also skeptical of a\nrule requiring officers to always obtain pre-approval\nfrom a magistrate judge to use the electronic tools neces-\nsary to conduct searches tailored to uncovering\nevidence that is responsive to a properly circumscribed\nwarrant.\n  Instead, we simply counsel officers and others involved\nin searches of digital media to exercise caution to\nensure that warrants describe with particularity the\nthings to be seized and that searches are narrowly\ntailored to uncover only those things described. As dis-\ncussed above, with the exception of the four “KFF Alert”\nimages, Detective Huff’s search was indeed targeted to\nuncovering evidence of voyeurism as described in what\nMann now concedes was a lawful warrant.2 In so doing,\nhe uncovered obvious evidence of child pornography.\nAlthough we now hold that his actions were within\nthe scope of the warrant, we emphasize that his failure\nto stop his search and request a separate warrant for\nchild pornography is troubling. Burgess, 576 F.3d at 1095\n(noting that when searching detective “observed a\npossible criminal violation outside the scope of the war-\nrant’s search authorization” he “immediately closed the\ngallery view . . . and did not renew the search until he\n\n\n\n2\n  Although Mann argued in the district court that the\nwarrant lacked probable cause, he has since abandoned that\nchallenge.\n\fNo. 08-3041                                           15\n\nobtained a new warrant”). Because Detective Huff\nwas not in a rapidly unfolding situation or searching a\nlocation where evidence was likely to move or change,\nthere was no downside to halting the search to obtain\na second warrant. Indeed, we find it problematic that\nnearly two months elapsed before Detective Huff began\nhis search of the Western Digital hard drive despite\nhaving found child pornography on the Dell laptop.\nHowever, notwithstanding our distaste for the timeline\nof the investigation, we conclude that the original\nwarrant authorized Detective Huff’s search of the\nexternal hard drive for images of voyeurism. Given this,\nwe ultimately conclude that, with the exception of the\nfour “KFF alert” images, the search was lawful, particu-\nlarly since Detective Huff did indeed uncover further\nevidence of voyeurism on the external hard drive.\nBecause Detective Huff discovered the child pornography\nwhile conducting a systematic search for evidence of\nvoyeurism, we conclude that his actions were reasonable\nand within the scope of the warrant’s authorization.
