Mello, J.\n\nDennis M. Wygmans, Addison County Deputy State’s Attorney, Middlebury, for\n Plaintiff-Appellee.\n\nAllison N. Fulcher of Martin & Associates, Barre, for Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\nPRESENT: Reiber, C.J., Dooley, Skoglund, Robinson and Eaton, JJ.\n\n\n        ¶ 1.   DOOLEY, J.      Defendant appeals his conviction in Addison Superior Court on\n\nthe grounds that the court erred by: (1) admitting the victim’s out-of-court statements under\n\nVermont Rule of Evidence 804a; (2) admitting expert testimony under Vermont Rule of\n\nEvidence 702; and (3) coercing a jury verdict. We affirm.\n\n        ¶ 2.   Defendant was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a minor under the age of\n\nthirteen in violation of 13 V.S.A. § 3253(a)(8). The victim, T.B., was twelve years old at the\n\ntime of the incident that gave rise to this case. Evidence presented at trial demonstrates the\n\nfollowing. On November 14, 2012, T.B. arrived home from school and was alone in the house\n\nwith defendant, her uncle, with whom she lived. Defendant followed T.B. into her bedroom and\n\fasked her for a “hand job.” He then asked T.B. to come sit in the living room where he again\n\nasked for a hand job. When she refused, he slapped her across the face and on the back of her\n\nhead and forced her hand down his pants. He then told her that he wanted her to watch a video\n\non his cell phone of a girl giving a man a hand job so that she would know how to do it.\n\nEventually, defendant told T.B. to go in the bedroom where he forced her onto the bed, fondled\n\nand performed oral sex on her, and forced her to perform oral sex on him. After the incident,\n\nT.B. left the house and waited in the farm store across the street until her aunt came home. Later\n\nthat night, T.B. wrote a letter about the incident and about how she no longer felt safe in her\n\nhome. The next morning on the bus, she showed the letter to a friend, who encouraged her to tell\n\nthe school principal. T.B. showed the letter to the vice principal, and the school officials called\n\nthe police and a Department for Children and Families case worker.\n\n       ¶ 3.    Prior to trial, the parties submitted two motions in limine that are the focus of this\n\nappeal.1 The State moved to admit T.B.’s letter under Rule 804a, which allows admission of out-\n\nof-court statements made by a child of age twelve years or under, if several factors are met.\n\nDefendant moved to exclude the testimony of the State’s expert witness regarding the extraction\n\nof data from defendant’s cell phone. The court held motion hearings on October 8 and 9, 2013,\n\nand ruled both the letter and expert testimony admissible. The findings and conclusions of the\n\ncourt with respect to these motions, as well as the arguments of the parties, are discussed in more\n\ndetail in the opinion below.\n\n       ¶ 4.    After a three-day trial, the jury found defendant guilty. Defendant appeals his\n\nconviction and raises three claims of error: (1) the trial court erred in admitting T.B.’s letter\n\nunder Rule 804a because the State failed to establish that the time, content, and circumstances of\n\nthe statements provided a substantial indicia of trustworthiness; (2) the trial court erred in\n\n\n       1\n         Defendant also submitted a motion to exclude evidence of his prior bad acts under\nVermont Rule of Evidence 404(b), but the decision on that motion is not part of this appeal.\n                                              2\n\fadmitting the expert testimony regarding the extraction of data from defendant’s cell phone\n\nbecause the State failed to establish that the software and methods used are sufficiently reliable\n\nunder Rule 702; and (3) the trial court coerced a jury verdict by telling the jury that if they did\n\nnot reach a verdict by the end of the day they would have to stop deliberating and return\n\nMonday. We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court on all three points.\n\n       ¶ 5.    We turn first to defendant’s Rule 804a claim.           We review the trial court’s\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. State v. Breed, 2015 VT 43, ¶ 46, ___ Vt. ___, ___\n\nA.3d ___. “We uphold the trial court’s conclusion that hearsay statements are trustworthy under\n\nRule 804a(a)(4) if it is supported by the findings, which must be supported by credible evidence\n\nin the record.” State v. Reid, 2012 VT 65, ¶ 20, 192 Vt. 356, 59 A.3d 711.\n\n       ¶ 6.    Vermont Rule of Evidence 804a(a) allows admission of out-of-court statements\n\nmade by putative victims of aggravated sexual assault if “the time, content, and circumstances of\n\nthe statements provide substantial indicia of trustworthiness.” V.R.E. 804a(a)(4). 2 Essentially,\n\ndefendant argues that the court’s conclusion as to the trustworthiness of the letter is not\n\nsupported by credible evidence in the record.         Specifically, defendant maintains that T.B.\n\nfabricated the entire story and that the letter was the start of that fabrication. He emphasizes that\n\nthe “only evidence presented in support of admission of the letter was the letter itself, and the\n\ntestimony of [T.B.’s friend and the detective],” and that “[n]o one witnessed T.B. write the\n\nletter.” Defendant’s argument appears to be that the circumstances surrounding T.B.’s disclosure\n\nof the letter are not relevant here for establishing the letter’s trustworthiness, but that the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the actual writing of the letter must prove it to be trustworthy. The\n\nState, on the other hand, explains that “it is the disclosure of the note relative to the occurrence of\n\nthe assault that provides indicia of trustworthiness.” Defendant relies on one case, State v. Reid,\n\n\n       2\n          Rule 804a(a) provides other factors that must be met for the testimony to be admitted,\nbut those factors are not at issue here.\n                                                3\n\f2012 VT 65, which provides a nonexclusive list of factors relevant to determining the\n\ntrustworthiness of Rule 804a statements.\n\n       ¶ 7.    The factors outlined in Reid provide a starting point for our analysis and help us\n\nestablish a framework for reviewing the trial court’s conclusion. As explained in Reid, courts\n\nmay consider such factors as: the circumstances of the initial disclosure, including the setting and\n\nperson to whom the disclosures were made; internal consistency and detail of disclosures; timing\n\nand conduct of interviews, including whether nonleading questions were asked; freshness and\n\nspontaneity of disclosures; appropriate body language; risk of fabrication; evidence of coercion\n\nor manipulation; accuracy of peripheral detail; the child’s affect, intelligence, memory, and\n\nconcern for the truth; and corroboration by medical and other evidence. Id. ¶ 24; see also State\n\nv. Tester, 2006 VT 24, ¶ 17, 179 Vt. 627, 895 A.2d 215 (mem.); State v. LaBounty, 168 Vt. 129,\n\n136-38, 716 A.2d 1, 7 (1998); State v. Fisher, 167 Vt. 36, 40-41, 702 A.2d 41, 44 (1997); State v.\n\nLawton, 164 Vt. 179, 190, 667 A.2d 50, 59 (1995); In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 69, 605 A.2d 515,\n\n518 (1992); State v. Gallagher, 150 Vt. 341, 348, 554 A.2d 221, 225 (1988). As Reid states, and\n\nthe cases cited therein make clear, this list is not exhaustive, and the court need not consider all\n\nthe factors in finding the testimony admissible. For example, in State v. Lawton, we affirmed the\n\ntrial court’s admission of a child’s statements as trustworthy because they were made in response\n\nto the first time the mother asked the child about incidents involving the father and were\n\ntherefore not a product of repeated interviewing, coercion, or manipulation. 164 Vt. at 190, 667\n\nA.2d at 59.\n\n       ¶ 8.    Here, the court found T.B.’s letter trustworthy because she wrote the letter to the\n\nvice principal—a trusted adult—expressing her need to tell someone about the incident and her\n\nfear of going back home. The court also found the language, spelling, and writing of the letter\n\nall age appropriate, indicating that T.B. was not coached or prompted by anyone. Furthermore,\n\nthe court found that when T.B. and her friend were discussing the letter on the bus—right after\n\n                                                 4\n\fthe friend read the letter—the statements were made spontaneously at a time when T.B. and her\n\nfriend were not otherwise talking about sexual issues or abuse; the statements were made to a\n\ntrusted friend in a safe place; T.B.’s body language was consistent with that of someone alleging\n\nsexual abuse; and T.B.’s statements were consistent with those she made to the police. The\n\ncourt’s findings here reflect many of the factors discussed in Reid, 2012 VT 64, ¶ 24; see supra,\n\n¶ 7.\n\n       ¶ 9.    Defendant maintains, however, that these findings are not sufficient to alleviate\n\nconcerns that the contents of the letter were fabricated because, as defendant stresses, “[n]o one\n\nwitnessed T.B. write the letter.” We find no case—and defendant cites no case—where such\n\nstatements have been held inadmissible merely because the putative victim penned the letter in\n\nprivate where nobody was around to attest to the circumstances surrounding its creation; in fact,\n\nit is likely that most letters of this nature, particularly those written by children, are written in\n\nprivate and later disclosed to a trusted peer or adult.\n\n       ¶ 10.   Courts generally consider written statements equally as trustworthy as oral\n\nstatements when reviewing such statements under hearsay exceptions like Rule 804a or under\n\nresidual hearsay exception rules. See, e.g., State v. John G., 837 A.2d 829, 837 (Conn. App. Ct.\n\n2004) (“[T]he dispositive factor in deciding whether a victim’s statement properly is admissible\n\nas constancy of accusation evidence is not whether such statement is written or oral.”);\n\nCommonwealth v. Lanning, 589 N.E.2d 318, 323 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992) (“[W]e can think of no\n\nreason why the admissibility of [the victim’s statement] should turn on whether the [statement]\n\nwas written or oral.”).\n\n       ¶ 11.   In fact, a handful of courts have discussed the trustworthiness of written\n\nstatements and admitted the statements for reasons comparable to those given by the trial court\n\nhere. The most instructive of these cases is United States v. Morgan, 385 F.3d 196 (2d Cir.\n\n2004). There, the defendant appealed her conviction for conspiracy to import, importation, and\n\n                                                   5\n\fpossession with the intent to distribute controlled substances. She argued that an inculpatory\n\nletter written by her co-defendant to the co-defendant’s boyfriend was hearsay that the court\n\nerred in admitting at trial. The letter was admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 807, the\n\nresidual hearsay exception, which requires that evidence be “particularly trustworthy.” Id. at 208\n\n(quoting United States v. Bryce, 208 F.3d 346, 350-51 (2d Cir. 1999)).\n\n       ¶ 12.   In affirming the trial court’s admission of the letter, the circuit court looked to\n\nprecedent that recognizes an exception to the general prohibition on the admission of an\n\naccomplice’s inculpatory hearsay statement to prove the guilt of the accused when “the statement\n\nis made to a person whom the declarant believes is an ally rather than a law enforcement\n\nofficial” and the inculpatory portions of the statement are as trustworthy as the portions\n\nincriminating the accomplice. Id. at 208-09 (quoting United States v. Matthews, 20 F.3d 538,\n\n546 (2d Cir. 1994)). The circuit court found the letter sufficiently trustworthy because it “was\n\nnot in response to police questioning”; “was not written in a coercive atmosphere”; “was not\n\naddressed to law enforcement authorities”; and was written “to an intimate acquaintance . . . in\n\nthe privacy of her hotel room.” Id. at 209.\n\n       ¶ 13.   As noted above, the court found that T.B. wrote this letter to a trusted adult for\n\nhelp in a matter that concerned and frightened her and that there was no evidence of coercion.\n\nLike the letter in Morgan, the letter here was written in private. While defendant seems to argue\n\nthat private letter-writing somehow undermines the trustworthiness of the contents, the circuit\n\ncourt found the act of writing in private to be an indicator of trustworthiness—likely because it\n\ndemonstrates absence of outside influences. We agree with the Morgan court’s analysis and\n\nconclude that the trial court’s finding of trustworthiness is supported by the record and that the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting T.B.’s letter.\n\n       ¶ 14.   We turn next to defendant’s Rule 702 claim, again keeping in mind our\n\ndeferential, abuse-of-discretion review. See USGen New Eng., Inc. v. Town of Rockingham,\n\n                                                  6\n\f2004 VT 90, ¶ 21, 177 Vt. 193, 862 A.2d 269 (reviewing trial court’s decision to admit expert\n\ntestimony for abuse of discretion); see also Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 141-42 (1997)\n\n(holding that, although liberal standard exists for admissibility of expert testimony, appellate\n\nreview must remain consistent with that for other evidentiary rulings).\n\n       ¶ 15.   As to this issue, defendant argues that the court erred in admitting the forensic\n\nexpert’s testimony regarding his use of the Cellebrite software for retrieving the contents of\n\ndefendant’s cell phone.3 Defendant’s primary claim is that, while the forensic expert had a\n\n“general understanding of how the program works[,] . . . he did not have any understanding of\n\nthe programming behind the software.”         Defendant also challenges the reliability of the\n\ntestimony, arguing that the State was unable to satisfy any of the factors outlined in Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). Specifically, defendant contends that\n\nthe forensic expert’s responses were “conclusory”; that he self-tested the program “using other\n\nsoftware equally under scrutiny”; and that he read some periodicals about the program and is\n\naware of its capabilities, but has no knowledge of its error rates and believes the program is\n\nreliable merely “because it [is] the most popular program used to examine cell phones and\n\nbecause he was told it was reliable.”\n\n       ¶ 16.   We start with the law governing the admissibility of expert testimony. Vermont\n\nRule of Evidence 702 provides:\n\n                 If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist\n               the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n               issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,\n               experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form\n               of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon\n               sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable\n               principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the\n               principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\n\n\n\n       3\n          The search of defendant’s cell phone revealed URLs from a pornographic website,\nincluding one linking to a video involving a teenage girl.\n                                                 7\n\fAs the Reporter’s Notes explain, Rule 702 is identical to its federal counterpart, as originally\n\ndrafted and as amended in response to a trilogy of United States Supreme Court cases, beginning\n\nwith Daubert, that expound the limits of admissibility for expert testimony and create workable\n\nstandards for use by trial judges in assessing the qualifications of experts and the reliability of the\n\nmethods by which they reached their proffered opinions. The Daubert Court held that Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 702 superseded the traditional “general acceptance” test established in Frye v.\n\nUnited States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), by removing the barriers to admissibility inherent in\n\nthe general acceptance test and instead instituting a flexible standard guided by the dual\n\nprinciples of relevance and reliability. 985 Assocs. v. Daewoo Elecs. Am., Inc., 2008 VT 14,\n\n¶ 6, 183 Vt. 208, 945 A.2d 381 (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 588-89).\n\n       ¶ 17.   To assist trial judges in determining whether an expert’s opinion is sufficiently\n\nrooted in scientific knowledge, the Daubert Court delineated four nonexclusive factors a judge\n\nmay consider when assessing admissibility: (1) whether the theory or technique involved is\n\ncapable of being tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review\n\nand publication; (3) the known or potential error rate associated with the scientific technique; and\n\n(4) whether the theory or technique has been generally accepted in the scientific community.\n\nState v. Streich, 163 Vt. 331, 343, 658 A.2d 38, 47 (1995) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591-94).\n\nWe adopted those factors in State v. Brooks, 162 Vt. 26, 30, 643 A.2d 226, 229 (1993), to\n\n“promote more liberal admission of expert evidence.” State v. Scott, 2013 VT 103, ¶ 12, 195 Vt.\n\n330, 88 A.3d 1173. Following Daubert, trial judges “must now act as gatekeepers who screen\n\nexpert testimony ensuring that it is reliable and helpful to the issue at hand before the jury hears\n\nit.” USGen, 2004 VT 90, ¶ 19. Although courts have diverged on how exacting the Daubert\n\ninquiry must be, we have focused on the “liberal thrust” of Rule 702, stating that “the trial\n\ncourt’s inquiry into expert testimony should primarily focus on excluding ‘junk science’—\n\nbecause of its potential to confuse or mislead the trier of fact—rather than serving as a\n\n                                                  8\n\fpreliminary inquiry into the merits of the case.” Daewoo, 2008 VT 14, ¶¶ 8-10 (“We adopted\n\nthe Daubert decision precisely because it comported with the ‘liberal thrust’ of the rules of\n\nevidence and broadened the types of evidence that could be considered by the jury at trial.”\n\n(quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 588)).\n\n       ¶ 18.   The United States Supreme Court issued a subsequent decision that provides\n\nguidance here. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999), expanded the applicability\n\nof Daubert to nonscientific expert testimony—i.e., testimony relying upon “technical” and “other\n\nspecialized knowledge,” as termed in the amendments to Rule 702. Prior to Kumho, the question\n\nof Daubert’s reach remained unanswered, with states taking either a liberal or conservative\n\napproach to the admissibility of nonscientific testimony.       See 1 K. Broun, McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 13 (7th ed. 2013). The Supreme Court resolved this issue in Kumho, holding that the\n\ntrial judge’s gatekeeping obligation applies equally to testimony based on “technical” and “other\n\nspecialized knowledge.” 526 U.S. at 141. In so holding, the Court explained that Daubert is not\n\na one-size-fits-all analysis, but rather the trial judge may consider one or more of the factors\n\n“when doing so will help determine the testimony’s reliability.” Id. It further explained that the\n\nfactors are not a “definitive checklist or test” and “neither necessarily nor exclusively appl[y] to\n\nall experts or in every case.” Id. at 141, 150 (quotations omitted). “[T]here are many different\n\nkinds of experts, and many different kinds of expertise,” the Court observed, and in some cases\n\n“the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal knowledge or experience.” Id. at 150.\n\nThe Court further emphasized that “Rule 702 [does not] create[] a schematism that segregates\n\nexpertise by type while mapping certain kinds of questions to certain kinds of experts.” Id. at\n\n151. In light of this expanded view of Rule 702 and the Daubert inquiry, the Court rearticulated\n\nthe objective of the gatekeeping requirement as “ensur[ing] the reliability and relevancy of\n\nexpert testimony” and “mak[ing] certain that an expert . . . employs in the courtroom the same\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\flevel of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Id. at\n\n152.\n\n       ¶ 19.   We have endorsed this approach, stating that the Daubert factors “are not\n\nexhaustive, and a trial court has broad discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether\n\nsome or any of the factors are relevant in evaluating the reliability of expert evidence before it.”\n\nScott, 2013 VT 103, ¶ 10 (quotation omitted). We further explained in State v. Kinney, 171 Vt.\n\n239, 762 A.2d 833 (2000), that a mechanical application of the Daubert factors to expert\n\ntestimony is not necessary where the scientific or technical evidence is not novel and its\n\nreliability otherwise can be established. Id. at 249-50. Notably, we concluded that the State was\n\nnot obligated to present independent evidence, nor was the trial court required to make\n\nindependent findings, on each of the Daubert factors because the reliability of the expert\n\ntestimony could be established through other means, particularly through analogy to comparable\n\ntechnical evidence we have allowed trial courts the discretion to admit and through evaluation of\n\nthe same type of evidence by other courts. Id. at 250.\n\n       ¶ 20.   Having established the flexibility with which we apply Rule 702 and the Daubert\n\nfactors to nonscientific expert testimony, we must determine what type of foundation for\n\nreliability is required for the admissibility of the testimony here, particularly keeping in mind\n\ndefendant’s argument that the forensic expert’s lack of knowledge about the underlying\n\nprogramming of the Cellebrite software is fatal to his testimony’s reliability. Although we can\n\nfind no case from this Court directly on point, several other courts have taken a liberal approach\n\nin admitting testimony regarding computer software and other technical devices upon reliability\n\nfoundations similar to that laid by the State here.4\n\n\n\n       4\n           We note that some of these courts still rely on a version of the Frye “general\nacceptance” standard, or some hybrid of Frye and their own common law standards. We do not\nbelieve that this alters the applicability or persuasive value of these cases because the analyses\n                                                  10\n\f        ¶ 21.   Closely on point is United States v. Chiaradio, 684 F.3d 265 (1st Cir. 2012). In\n\nChiaradio, an FBI agent testified to his investigatory technique of using an enhanced peer-to-peer\n\n(EP2P) file sharing program to identify Internet Protocol addresses where child pornography has\n\nbeen downloaded. The defendant objected to the court’s admission of the agent’s testimony\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702 because the EP2P technology was “too untested to form an\n\nadequate foundation” for the agent’s testimony. Id. at 277. In affirming the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt, the circuit court concluded:\n\n                Although [the agent] was not a programmer, did not know the\n                program’s authors, and had never seen the source code, he had\n                significant specialized experience with both EP2P and the manual\n                re-creation of EP2P sessions. He testified that the program, with\n                respect to identifying the source of particular files, had no error\n                rate.    He also demonstrated how the results of an EP2P\n                investigation could be independently verified and made it clear that\n                EP2P had never yielded a false positive.\n\nId. at 278.\n\n        ¶ 22.   Also on point is Krause v. State, 243 S.W.3d 95 (Tex. App. 2007). In Krause, the\n\ncourt considered the qualifications of a forensic examiner using specialized software called I-\n\nLook to create an exact duplicate of the defendant’s computer hard drive in order to search for\n\nevidence of child pornography. The forensic examiner testified that the hard drive was an exact\n\ncopy because the “Hash value”—or “fingerprint”—of the copy matched that of the original. He\n\nconceded that he was “not sure exactly how the formula or algorithm works” and did not know\n\n“from where the mathematical formula for the Hash values came.” Id. at 101. He stated,\n\nhowever, that the formula had “been approved by our headquarters and it’s the formula that we\n\nuse to get that value” and that the program “was industry standard and generally accepted in the\n\nscientific community.” Id. The defendant objected that the testimony was “not sufficiently\n\nreliable” because the forensic examiner did not know how the program reproduced the copies of\n\n\nconducted by those courts comport with the flexible principles of Daubert as applied by this\nCourt.\n                                           11\n\fthe original hard drives. Id. In approving the trial court’s admission of the testimony, the\n\nappellate court discussed the forensic examiner’s qualifications; his experience in data recovery\n\nand analysis and computer investigation; his work with the FBI; his 200 hours of training in\n\nforensic examination, including training in software programs like I-Look; and his experience\n\nconducting around 150 forensic examinations for the FBI, half of which involved I-Look. Id. at\n\n109. With respect to the reliability of the software, the court stated:\n\n                   Regarding the clarity with which the underlying scientific theory\n                 and technique can be explained to the court, [the expert] explained\n                 that he had used I-Look on computer files taken from [the\n                 defendant’s] external hard drive and computers. I-Look indexed\n                 the files, and [the expert] was able to retrieve files containing child\n                 pornography from [the defendant’s] hard drives. When [the\n                 examiner] took a hard drive from a computer, he used a program\n                 like I-Look to automate the task of searching and finding the files\n                 on it. An image of the drive was taken; the files were copied; and\n                 I-Look validated the copy by a “Hash value,” an algorithm that\n                 verifies the image. [The expert’s] testimony established I-Look’s\n                 reliability.\n\nId. at 109-10.\n\n       ¶ 23.     In reaching its conclusion, the appellate court relied on an earlier decision that we\n\nalso find instructive here. In Williford v. State, 127 S.W.3d 309 (Tex. App. 2004), the court\n\nconsidered a detective’s testimony regarding a program called EnCase, which copies data from\n\none computer hard drive to another. The defendant objected to this testimony “on the ground\n\nthat [the detective] was not qualified as an expert to testify about the theory or technique in\n\ndeveloping the EnCase software or its reliability.” Id. at 311. In approving the admission of the\n\ntestimony, the appellate court concluded the it was reliable because the detective was\n\nknowledgeable about using EnCase and had used it in the past; the software was generally\n\naccepted in the computer forensic community worldwide, had a low potential error rate, and had\n\nbeen reviewed in publications; and the accuracy of the software had been verified by the\n\ndetective and, because of its commercial availability, could be tested. Id. at 312-13; see also\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fSanders v. State, 191 S.W.3d 272, 277-78 (Tex. App. 2006) (approving admission of expert\n\ntestimony on use of EnCase where detective had training and experience using software,\n\ndiscussed periodicals writing about software, and testified that software was “field standard” for\n\nforensic computer examination).\n\n       ¶ 24.   Forensic investigation increasingly requires the use of computer software or other\n\ntechnological devices for the extraction of data. While an investigator must have specialized\n\nknowledge in the use of the particular software or device, it is not required—nor is it practical—\n\nfor an investigator to have expertise in or knowledge about the underlying programming,\n\nmathematical formulas, or other innerworkings of the software. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nSpringstead, 520 F. App’x 168, 169-70 (4th Cir. 2013) (approving trial court’s admission of\n\ncomputer forensic examination software, against defendant’s objection that agent “lacked the\n\nrequisite knowledge and training to explain how the [forensic] software used in this case was\n\ndesigned and functioned,” because agent testified to his training and experience with software);\n\nState v. Roberts, 2015 UT 24, ¶ 55, 345 P.3d 1226 (approving trial court’s admission of\n\ncomputer forensic examination software, against objection from defendant that software “relies\n\non undefined scientific methods,” because software was “readily available” and “fairly common”\n\nand officers were well trained in its use); cf. Moorman v. State, 574 So. 2d 953, 958-59 (Ala.\n\nCrim. App. 1990) (approving admissibility of toxicology technician’s testimony regarding\n\ntesting of defendant’s blood sample to determine blood-alcohol content, against defendant’s\n\nobjection that technician’s knowledge of how machine worked was not based on her personal\n\nknowledge but on manufacturer’s manual, because evidence demonstrated that blood sample was\n\n“analyzed by an instrument generally accepted in the medical community” and “commonly\n\nemployed by hospitals for both ‘legal and medical purposes’ ” and that “instrument was operated\n\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fby a qualified technician who followed standard operating procedure in performing the test” and\n\n“was in proper operating order at the time of the test”).5\n\n       ¶ 25.   Returning to the testimony presented by the forensic expert, we conclude that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony. Our conclusion is supported by\n\nthe principles discussed above: our deferential, abuse-of-discretion review; the liberal\n\nadmissibility under Rule 702 and Daubert; and the flexible, nonmechanical application of the\n\nDaubert factors, specifically to nonscientific testimony.\n\n       ¶ 26.   As to the forensic expert’s qualifications, he testified that he had over 800 hours\n\nof training in the forensic examination of computer hard drives, digital media, and cell phones\n\nand a week of specific training in Cellebrite with a company that specializes in training and\n\nassistance to law enforcement. He also testified that he has used the program to extract data\n\nfrom hundreds of phones since 2010. He conceded that someone in his position would not be\n\nable to speak about the underlying programming, stating, “[W]e’re actually trained . . . to be very\n\ncareful about how we talk about how the software and hardware works . . . we’re not experts on\n\n\n\n       5\n          A handful of courts have considered testimony regarding the use of the Cellebrite\nsoftware and have ruled the testimony admissible where the witness had no knowledge of the\nprogramming behind the software. For example, in In re D.H., No. A140779, 2015 WL 514336\n(Cal. App. Feb. 6, 2015), the court explained that\n\n               [t]he testimony was not for the purpose of explaining how the\n               Cellebrite technology worked, and [the detective] did not opine\n               about the technological means by which the transfer occurred.\n               Instead, he essentially testified to his experience that attaching a\n               phone to his machine resulted in a display of photographic and\n               other information that was contained in the phone, and identified\n               the type of machine he used to download the material from [the\n               phone].\n\nId. at *6. Although this case supports our reasoning above, we do not find it entirely applicable\nbecause the court there held that the detective’s testimony was not expert testimony because data\nextraction is merely an “investigative technique.” Id. We consider the forensic expert’s\ntestimony here to be expert testimony because he has “specialized knowledge” about the use of\nCellebrite that is helpful to a jury.\n                                                 14\n\fthat.” He testified, however, that he read about the program, what it can do, what information it\n\ncan reveal, and how he can search and sort through the data.\n\n       ¶ 27.   As to the reliability of the program, the forensic expert testified that “numerous\n\nagencies use the software” and that it is “the most popular hardware and software solution for\n\nexamining cell phones.”     He testified that the program is routinely tested in the forensics\n\ncommunity; the results are tested in his agency by defense experts and through peer review of\n\ndata reports; and that because the program is commercially available, it is subject to testing. He\n\nalso stated that he self-tests his extraction results by comparing the computerized results to the\n\nresults of a manual examination to verify the data that has been extracted and that he compares\n\nthe results of his extraction with results from other forensic programs that overlap with\n\nCellebrite. He further stated that he has learned of the program’s reliability in the forensic\n\nindustry through his trainings, correspondence with colleagues, and email lists. He testified that,\n\nalthough the program’s error rate never was expressly discussed in his training, the program’s\n\nlimitations were.\n\n       ¶ 28.   The trial court concluded that the testimony was sufficiently reliable to meet the\n\nrequirements of Rule 702. The court focused specifically on the forensic expert’s training and\n\nexperience with Cellebrite, the software’s widespread use by law enforcement nationally, and\n\nthat the expert verified the accuracy of the data extraction through testing against manual\n\nextraction and other software programs. In response to defendant’s specific concern about the\n\nforensic expert’s lack of knowledge at the “programmatic level,” the court explained that such\n\nprogramming information is rarely understood by its users because it is “typically highly\n\nproprietary information known only to the manufacturer of the product.”\n\n       ¶ 29.   As the above-cited cases demonstrate, this is precisely the type of inquiry that\n\nestablishes the reliability of such technical evidence. A computer program for extracting cell\n\nphone data is hardly novel. While this particular program has not been the subject of many court\n\n                                                15\n\fdecisions, its reliability clearly has been established through the forensic expert’s foundational\n\ntestimony, and his qualifications to present such testimony, and through evaluation of similar\n\ntechnical evidence by this Court and others. And as discussed above, the State was not obligated\n\nto present evidence on each Daubert factor. The forensic expert’s testimony is not about basic\n\nscientific principles, and he is not drawing inferences from the facts. He merely is explaining\n\nhow he extracted the data from the cell phone and how he read that data—specialized knowledge\n\nthat he acquired through his training and experience. Many of the Daubert factors—and the\n\nheightened scrutiny given to scientific evidence—are impractical here and would do little to\n\ndraw out the reliability of Cellebrite. See Broun, supra, § 13 (explaining that when testimony\n\nsummarizes or describes experience in field, rather than drawing inferences from facts based on\n\nscientific theories or techniques, foundation that demonstrates expert’s experience in field may\n\nbe sufficient).\n\n        ¶ 30.     Furthermore, any deficiencies in the program should be drawn out through the\n\nadversarial process, including “vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence,\n\nand careful instruction on the burden of proof.” Daewoo, 2008 VT 14, ¶ 16 (quoting Daubert,\n\n509 U.S. at 596).       “So long as scientific or technical evidence has a sound factual and\n\nmethodological basis and is relevant to the issues at hand, it is within the purview of the trier of\n\nfact to assess its credibility and determine the weight to be assigned to it.” Id. As the trial court\n\nhere noted, the fact that the Cellebrite software did not extract all the data from defendant’s cell\n\nphone does not affect the admissibility of the testimony but instead goes to the weight of that\n\ntestimony. Counsel for defendant had access to the cell phone and had the opportunity to have it\n\nscanned by his own computer experts. The trial court here properly exercised its discretion as\n\ngatekeeper; the software used by the forensic expert hardly can be characterized as “junk\n\nscience.” It is left to the fact finder to weigh its credibility.\n\n\n\n                                                    16\n\f       ¶ 31.   Finally, we note that, although the State argued this issue based on Rule 702, and\n\nthe trial court conducted its analysis on that basis, defendant’s claim that the forensic expert’s\n\ntestimony is unreliable because he lacked a general understanding of the programming behind\n\nthe software also can be framed as a Vermont Rule of Evidence 703 issue not requiring Daubert\n\nanalysis at this point in the case. Rule 703 permits experts to base their opinions on facts or data\n\n“of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or\n\ninferences upon the subject,” V.R.E. 703, and “the facts or data need not be admissible in\n\nevidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted.” Id. The Reporter’s Notes to Rule\n\n703 explain that the rule is identical to the federal rule and is intended, in part, to allow\n\nadmission of data presented to the expert “outside the trial and not reflecting his personal\n\nexperience.” Reporter’s Notes, V.R.E. 703. The Reporter’s Notes to the concomitant federal\n\nrule further explain that “the rule is designed to broaden the basis for expert opinions . . . and to\n\nbring the judicial practice into line with the practice of the experts themselves when not in\n\ncourt.” Advisory Committee Notes, F.R.E. 703.\n\n       ¶ 32.   For example, in In re Jam Golf, LLC, 2008 VT 110, 185 Vt. 201, 969 A.2d 47, we\n\npermitted a wildlife expert to rely upon topographic features and wildlife movement that he had\n\nnot observed firsthand because they are “the type of facts and data with which wildlife experts\n\nare familiar.” Id. ¶ 10. Courts have applied similar reasoning when considering the admissibility\n\nof expert testimony on the use of computer software. See, e.g., McReynolds v. Sodexho Marriott\n\nServs., Inc., 349 F. Supp. 2d 30, 36-37 (D.D.C. 2004) (admitting expert testimony under Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 703 where expert was not personally familiar with computer programming but\n\nrelied upon assistant’s knowledge of programming). We note the possible application of Rule\n\n703 only to explain that there may be an alternative route to the same holding, but we ultimately\n\nground our decision on Rule 702.\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f       ¶ 33.   Defendant makes one final argument as to the admissibility of the expert\n\ntestimony. He contends that the State failed to establish a sufficient chain of custody for\n\ndefendant’s cell phone, specifically that the forensic expert could not account for its whereabouts\n\nat all times before it reached his office and acknowledged that the phone was stored improperly\n\nfor some period of time. We note that this is not a Rule 702 issue, State v. Tester, 2009 VT 3,\n\n¶ 18, 185 Vt. 241, 968 A.2d 895, but merely one of admissibility and authentication of evidence\n\ngenerally, State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 107, 807 A.2d 407, 413 (2002). “[T]he test for\n\nauthenticating evidence is not a demanding one, and . . . some questions regarding a piece of\n\nevidence’s origin or chain of custody are permissible.” Id. We do not require absolute certainty\n\nin laying a foundation for admissibility but require that “the evidence be of demonstrable\n\nrelevance and of sufficient meaningful substance to be justifiably relied upon” and not “an\n\ninsubstantial invitation to conjecture.” Id. (quotation omitted). Furthermore, a chain of custody\n\nneed not be established perfectly; imperfections go to the weight, not the admissibility. State v.\n\nMercier, 138 Vt. 149, 153, 412 A.2d 291, 294 (1980). Rather, the circumstances need to\n\nestablish only a “reasonable assurance” that the evidence is authentic and has not been tampered\n\nwith. State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 477, 408 A.2d 622, 625 (1979).\n\n       ¶ 34.   The forensic expert testified that the cell phone was sent from defendant’s home\n\nto the barracks in New Haven and then to his office where it was stored in the evidence room.\n\nHe acknowledged that he did not know exactly what happened to the phone between leaving\n\ndefendant’s possession and arriving at his office and also acknowledged that it had been stored\n\nimproperly (turned on) at some point before reaching his office. He also testified, however, that\n\nthe fact that the phone was left on had no effect on the data he subsequently extracted from the\n\nphone. There is no evidence of a break in the chain of custody, and other than the phone being\n\nleft on, there is no other evidence to suggest tampering.\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f       ¶ 35.   We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting\n\nthe forensic expert’s testimony regarding the extraction of data from defendant’s cell phone.\n\n       ¶ 36.   Lastly, we turn to defendant’s claim that the jury verdict was coerced. Defendant\n\nargues that the trial court improperly coerced a jury verdict when it informed the jury that they\n\nwould have two hours that day to deliberate and then added: “but if you don’t have a verdict by\n\n5:30 that’s fine, but we will then suspend and have you back on Monday.” The court also\n\nadvised the jury “to take all the time you need.” Defendant’s complaint is that the court should\n\nhave given the jury a choice to start deliberations that day or wait until Monday. Defendant\n\nbears the burden of presenting facts sufficient to support his claim that the verdict was coerced.\n\nState v. Hudson, 163 Vt. 316, 324, 658 A.2d 531, 536 (1995).\n\n       ¶ 37.   In support of his argument, defendant cites a litany of cases that stand for the\n\nproposition that a court cannot place time limits on a jury’s deliberations or in any way indicate\n\nthat speed is more important than thoughtfulness. None of those cases support a finding of\n\ncoercion here. In Hudson, we rejected the defendant’s claim that the court improperly coerced a\n\njury verdict by informing the jurors that they would be sent to a hotel if they did not reach a\n\nverdict by 10:00 p.m. Id. at 323, 658 A.2d at 535. We explained that the court already had\n\nadvised the jurors to be prepared to stay overnight and “made it clear that it did not intend to\n\nsuggest that it was imposing a time limit for reaching a verdict.” Id. at 324, 658 A.2d at 536; see\n\nState v. James, 499 So. 2d 721, 727 (La. Ct. App. 1986) (finding no error where jurors were\n\ninformed they would spend night in hotel if verdict was not reached because “the jury members\n\nwere entitled to know . . . what would happen if they could not reach a verdict that night”).\n\n       ¶ 38.   Here, we see no coercion in the trial court’s statement to the jury. The court never\n\ntold the jury that it must reach a decision that night. The court merely was explaining the fact\n\nthat it was the end of the week and that deliberations would resume on Monday if necessary—\n\nthis is something the jury members were entitled to know. Further, the court stressed that it was\n\n                                                19\n\f“fine” if the jurors did not reach a decision by the end of the day and told them to “take all the\n\ntime you need.”     We also fail to see how explicitly giving the jury a choice of starting\n\ndeliberations on Friday or waiting until Monday would make any practical difference in how the\n\njury approaches deliberations. We therefore find no error in the trial court’s statement to the\n\njury.\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                              FOR THE COURT:\n\n\n\n                                              Associate Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\f",

Defendant appeals his conviction in Addison Superior Court on\n\nthe grounds that the court erred by: (1) admitting the victim’s out-of-court statements under\n\nVermont Rule of Evidence 804a; (2) admitting expert testimony under Vermont Rule of\n\nEvidence 702; and (3) coercing a jury verdict. We affirm.\n\n        ¶ 2.   Defendant was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a minor under the age of\n\nthirteen in violation of 13 V.S.A. § 3253(a)(8). The victim, T.B., was twelve years old at the\n\ntime of the incident that gave rise to this case. Evidence presented at trial demonstrates the\n\nfollowing. On November 14, 2012, T.B. arrived home from school and was alone in the house\n\nwith defendant, her uncle, with whom she lived. Defendant followed T.B. into her bedroom and\n\fasked her for a “hand job.” He then asked T.B. to come sit in the living room where he again\n\nasked for a hand job. When she refused, he slapped her across the face and on the back of her\n\nhead and forced her hand down his pants. He then told her that he wanted her to watch a video\n\non his cell phone of a girl giving a man a hand job so that she would know how to do it.\n\nEventually, defendant told T.B. to go in the bedroom where he forced her onto the bed, fondled\n\nand performed oral sex on her, and forced her to perform oral sex on him. After the incident,\n\nT.B. left the house and waited in the farm store across the street until her aunt came home. Later\n\nthat night, T.B. wrote a letter about the incident and about how she no longer felt safe in her\n\nhome. The next morning on the bus, she showed the letter to a friend, who encouraged her to tell\n\nthe school principal. T.B. showed the letter to the vice principal, and the school officials called\n\nthe police and a Department for Children and Families case worker.\n\n       ¶ 3.    Prior to trial, the parties submitted two motions in limine that are the focus of this\n\nappeal.1 The State moved to admit T.B.’s letter under Rule 804a, which allows admission of out-\n\nof-court statements made by a child of age twelve years or under, if several factors are met.\n\nDefendant moved to exclude the testimony of the State’s expert witness regarding the extraction\n\nof data from defendant’s cell phone. The court held motion hearings on October 8 and 9, 2013,\n\nand ruled both the letter and expert testimony admissible. The findings and conclusions of the\n\ncourt with respect to these motions, as well as the arguments of the parties, are discussed in more\n\ndetail in the opinion below.\n\n       ¶ 4.    After a three-day trial, the jury found defendant guilty. Defendant appeals his\n\nconviction and raises three claims of error: (1) the trial court erred in admitting T.B.’s letter\n\nunder Rule 804a because the State failed to establish that the time, content, and circumstances of\n\nthe statements provided a substantial indicia of trustworthiness; (2) the trial court erred in\n\n\n       1\n         Defendant also submitted a motion to exclude evidence of his prior bad acts under\nVermont Rule of Evidence 404(b), but the decision on that motion is not part of this appeal.\n                                              2\n\fadmitting the expert testimony regarding the extraction of data from defendant’s cell phone\n\nbecause the State failed to establish that the software and methods used are sufficiently reliable\n\nunder Rule 702; and (3) the trial court coerced a jury verdict by telling the jury that if they did\n\nnot reach a verdict by the end of the day they would have to stop deliberating and return\n\nMonday. We find no error and affirm the judgment of the trial court on all three points.\n\n       ¶ 5.    We turn first to defendant’s Rule 804a claim.           We review the trial court’s\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. State v. Breed, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 46, ___ Vt. ___, ___\n\nA.3d ___. “We uphold the trial court’s conclusion that hearsay statements are trustworthy under\n\nRule 804a(a)(4) if it is supported by the findings, which must be supported by credible evidence\n\nin the record.” State v.

Vermont Rule of Evidence 804a(a) allows admission of out-of-court statements\n\nmade by putative victims of aggravated sexual assault if “the time, content, and circumstances of\n\nthe statements provide substantial indicia of trustworthiness.” V.R.E. 804a(a)(4). 2 Essentially,\n\ndefendant argues that the court’s conclusion as to the trustworthiness of the letter is not\n\nsupported by credible evidence in the record.         Specifically, defendant maintains that T.B.\n\nfabricated the entire story and that the letter was the start of that fabrication. He emphasizes that\n\nthe “only evidence presented in support of admission of the letter was the letter itself, and the\n\ntestimony of [T.B.’s friend and the detective],” and that “[n]o one witnessed T.B. write the\n\nletter.” Defendant’s argument appears to be that the circumstances surrounding T.B.’s disclosure\n\nof the letter are not relevant here for establishing the letter’s trustworthiness, but that the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the actual writing of the letter must prove it to be trustworthy. The\n\nState, on the other hand, explains that “it is the disclosure of the note relative to the occurrence of\n\nthe assault that provides indicia of trustworthiness.” Defendant relies on one case, State v. Reid,\n\n\n       2\n          Rule 804a(a) provides other factors that must be met for the testimony to be admitted,\nbut those factors are not at issue here.\n                                                3\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which provides a nonexclusive list of factors relevant to determining the\n\ntrustworthiness of Rule 804a statements.\n\n       ¶ 7.    The factors outlined in Reid provide a starting point for our analysis and help us\n\nestablish a framework for reviewing the trial court’s conclusion. As explained in Reid, courts\n\nmay consider such factors as: the circumstances of the initial disclosure, including the setting and\n\nperson to whom the disclosures were made; internal consistency and detail of disclosures; timing\n\nand conduct of interviews, including whether nonleading questions were asked; freshness and\n\nspontaneity of disclosures; appropriate body language; risk of fabrication; evidence of coercion\n\nor manipulation; accuracy of peripheral detail; the child’s affect, intelligence, memory, and\n\nconcern for the truth; and corroboration by medical and other evidence.

As Reid states, and\n\nthe cases cited therein make clear, this list is not exhaustive, and the court need not consider all\n\nthe factors in finding the testimony admissible. For example, in State v. Lawton, we affirmed the\n\ntrial court’s admission of a child’s statements as trustworthy because they were made in response\n\nto the first time the mother asked the child about incidents involving the father and were\n\ntherefore not a product of repeated interviewing, coercion, or manipulation. 164 Vt. at 190, 667\n\nA.2d at 59.\n\n       ¶ 8.    Here, the court found T.B.’s letter trustworthy because she wrote the letter to the\n\nvice principal—a trusted adult—expressing her need to tell someone about the incident and her\n\nfear of going back home. The court also found the language, spelling, and writing of the letter\n\nall age appropriate, indicating that T.B. was not coached or prompted by anyone. Furthermore,\n\nthe court found that when T.B. and her friend were discussing the letter on the bus—right after\n\n                                                 4\n\fthe friend read the letter—the statements were made spontaneously at a time when T.B. and her\n\nfriend were not otherwise talking about sexual issues or abuse; the statements were made to a\n\ntrusted friend in a safe place; T.B.’s body language was consistent with that of someone alleging\n\nsexual abuse; and T.B.’s statements were consistent with those she made to the police. The\n\ncourt’s findings here reflect many of the factors discussed in Reid, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 24; see supra,\n\n¶ 7.\n\n       ¶ 9.    Defendant maintains, however, that these findings are not sufficient to alleviate\n\nconcerns that the contents of the letter were fabricated because, as defendant stresses, “[n]o one\n\nwitnessed T.B. write the letter.” We find no case—and defendant cites no case—where such\n\nstatements have been held inadmissible merely because the putative victim penned the letter in\n\nprivate where nobody was around to attest to the circumstances surrounding its creation; in fact,\n\nit is likely that most letters of this nature, particularly those written by children, are written in\n\nprivate and later disclosed to a trusted peer or adult.\n\n       ¶ 10.   Courts generally consider written statements equally as trustworthy as oral\n\nstatements when reviewing such statements under hearsay exceptions like Rule 804a or under\n\nresidual hearsay exception rules. See, e.g., State v. John G., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (Conn. App. Ct.\n\n2004) (“[T]he dispositive factor in deciding whether a victim’s statement properly is admissible\n\nas constancy of accusation evidence is not whether such statement is written or oral.”);\n\nCommonwealth v. Lanning, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239949\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239949/commonwealth-v-lanning/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992) (“[W]e can think of no\n\nreason why the admissibility of [the victim’s statement] should turn on whether the [statement]\n\nwas written or oral.”).\n\n       ¶ 11.   In fact, a handful of courts have discussed the trustworthiness of written\n\nstatements and admitted the statements for reasons comparable to those given by the trial court\n\nhere. The most instructive of these cases is United States v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787946\"><a href=\"/opinion/787946/united-states-of-america-appellant-cross-appellee-v-wendy-lynn-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir.\n\n2004). There, the defendant appealed her conviction for conspiracy to import, importation, and\n\n                                                   5\n\fpossession with the intent to distribute controlled substances. She argued that an inculpatory\n\nletter written by her co-defendant to the co-defendant’s boyfriend was hearsay that the court\n\nerred in admitting at trial. The letter was admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 807, the\n\nresidual hearsay exception, which requires that evidence be “particularly trustworthy.” Id. at 208\n\n(quoting United States v. Bryce, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350-51 (2d Cir. 1999)).\n\n       ¶ 12.   In affirming the trial court’s admission of the letter, the circuit court looked to\n\nprecedent that recognizes an exception to the general prohibition on the admission of an\n\naccomplice’s inculpatory hearsay statement to prove the guilt of the accused when “the statement\n\nis made to a person whom the declarant believes is an ally rather than a law enforcement\n\nofficial” and the inculpatory portions of the statement are as trustworthy as the portions\n\nincriminating the accomplice. Id. at 208-09 (quoting United States v. Matthews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666859\"><a href=\"/opinion/666859/united-states-v-michael-lee-matthews-and-robert-g-prater/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n546 (2d Cir. 1994)). The circuit court found the letter sufficiently trustworthy because it “was\n\nnot in response to police questioning”; “was not written in a coercive atmosphere”; “was not\n\naddressed to law enforcement authorities”; and was written “to an intimate acquaintance . . . in\n\nthe privacy of her hotel room.” Id. at 209.\n\n       ¶ 13.   As noted above, the court found that T.B. wrote this letter to a trusted adult for\n\nhelp in a matter that concerned and frightened her and that there was no evidence of coercion.\n\nLike the letter in Morgan, the letter here was written in private. While defendant seems to argue\n\nthat private letter-writing somehow undermines the trustworthiness of the contents, the circuit\n\ncourt found the act of writing in private to be an indicator of trustworthiness—likely because it\n\ndemonstrates absence of outside influences. We agree with the Morgan court’s analysis and\n\nconclude that the trial court’s finding of trustworthiness is supported by the record and that the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting T.B.’s letter.\n\n       ¶ 14.   We turn next to defendant’s Rule 702 claim, again keeping in mind our\n\ndeferential, abuse-of-discretion review. See USGen New Eng., Inc. v. Town of Rockingham,\n\n                                                  6\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 21, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (reviewing trial court’s decision to admit expert\n\ntestimony for abuse of discretion); see also Gen.

As to this issue, defendant argues that the court erred in admitting the forensic\n\nexpert’s testimony regarding his use of the Cellebrite software for retrieving the contents of\n\ndefendant’s cell phone.3 Defendant’s primary claim is that, while the forensic expert had a\n\n“general understanding of how the program works[,] . . . he did not have any understanding of\n\nthe programming behind the software.”         Defendant also challenges the reliability of the\n\ntestimony, arguing that the State was unable to satisfy any of the factors outlined in Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Specifically, defendant contends that\n\nthe forensic expert’s responses were “conclusory”; that he self-tested the program “using other\n\nsoftware equally under scrutiny”; and that he read some periodicals about the program and is\n\naware of its capabilities, but has no knowledge of its error rates and believes the program is\n\nreliable merely “because it [is] the most popular program used to examine cell phones and\n\nbecause he was told it was reliable.”\n\n       ¶ 16.   We start with the law governing the admissibility of expert testimony. Vermont\n\nRule of Evidence 702 provides:\n\n                 If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist\n               the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n               issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,\n               experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form\n               of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon\n               sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable\n               principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the\n               principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\n\n\n\n       3\n          The search of defendant’s cell phone revealed URLs from a pornographic website,\nincluding one linking to a video involving a teenage girl.\n                                                 7\n\fAs the Reporter’s Notes explain, Rule 702 is identical to its federal counterpart, as originally\n\ndrafted and as amended in response to a trilogy of United States Supreme Court cases, beginning\n\nwith Daubert, that expound the limits of admissibility for expert testimony and create workable\n\nstandards for use by trial judges in assessing the qualifications of experts and the reliability of the\n\nmethods by which they reached their proffered opinions. The Daubert Court held that Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 702 superseded the traditional “general acceptance” test established in Frye v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

To assist trial judges in determining whether an expert’s opinion is sufficiently\n\nrooted in scientific knowledge, the Daubert Court delineated four nonexclusive factors a judge\n\nmay consider when assessing admissibility: (1) whether the theory or technique involved is\n\ncapable of being tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review\n\nand publication; (3) the known or potential error rate associated with the scientific technique; and\n\n(4) whether the theory or technique has been generally accepted in the scientific community.\n\nState v.

Although courts have diverged on how exacting the Daubert\n\ninquiry must be, we have focused on the “liberal thrust” of Rule 702, stating that “the trial\n\ncourt’s inquiry into expert testimony should primarily focus on excluding ‘junk science’—\n\nbecause of its potential to confuse or mislead the trier of fact—rather than serving as a\n\n                                                  8\n\fpreliminary inquiry into the merits of the case.” Daewoo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057376\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057376/985-assocs-ltd-v-daewoo-electronics-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 8-10 (“We adopted\n\nthe Daubert decision precisely because it comported with the ‘liberal thrust’ of the rules of\n\nevidence and broadened the types of evidence that could be considered by the jury at trial.”\n\n(quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 588)).\n\n       ¶ 18.   The United States Supreme Court issued a subsequent decision that provides\n\nguidance here. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118271\"><a href=\"/opinion/118271/kumho-tire-co-v-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999), expanded the applicability\n\nof Daubert to nonscientific expert testimony—i.e., testimony relying upon “technical” and “other\n\nspecialized knowledge,” as termed in the amendments to Rule 702. Prior to Kumho, the question\n\nof Daubert’s reach remained unanswered, with states taking either a liberal or conservative\n\napproach to the admissibility of nonscientific testimony.       See 1 K. Broun, McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 13 (7th ed. 2013). The Supreme Court resolved this issue in Kumho, holding that the\n\ntrial judge’s gatekeeping obligation applies equally to testimony based on “technical” and “other\n\nspecialized knowledge.” 526 U.S. at 141. In so holding, the Court explained that Daubert is not\n\na one-size-fits-all analysis, but rather the trial judge may consider one or more of the factors\n\n“when doing so will help determine the testimony’s reliability.” Id. It further explained that the\n\nfactors are not a “definitive checklist or test” and “neither necessarily nor exclusively appl[y] to\n\nall experts or in every case.” Id. at 141, 150 (quotations omitted). “[T]here are many different\n\nkinds of experts, and many different kinds of expertise,” the Court observed, and in some cases\n\n“the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal knowledge or experience.” Id. at 150.\n\nThe Court further emphasized that “Rule 702 [does not] create[] a schematism that segregates\n\nexpertise by type while mapping certain kinds of questions to certain kinds of experts.” Id. at\n\n151. In light of this expanded view of Rule 702 and the Daubert inquiry, the Court rearticulated\n\nthe objective of the gatekeeping requirement as “ensur[ing] the reliability and relevancy of\n\nexpert testimony” and “mak[ing] certain that an expert . . . employs in the courtroom the same\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\flevel of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Id. at\n\n152.\n\n       ¶ 19.   We have endorsed this approach, stating that the Daubert factors “are not\n\nexhaustive, and a trial court has broad discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether\n\nsome or any of the factors are relevant in evaluating the reliability of expert evidence before it.”\n\nScott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 10 (quotation omitted).

Id. at 249-50. Notably, we concluded that the State was\n\nnot obligated to present independent evidence, nor was the trial court required to make\n\nindependent findings, on each of the Daubert factors because the reliability of the expert\n\ntestimony could be established through other means, particularly through analogy to comparable\n\ntechnical evidence we have allowed trial courts the discretion to admit and through evaluation of\n\nthe same type of evidence by other courts. Id. at 250.\n\n       ¶ 20.   Having established the flexibility with which we apply Rule 702 and the Daubert\n\nfactors to nonscientific expert testimony, we must determine what type of foundation for\n\nreliability is required for the admissibility of the testimony here, particularly keeping in mind\n\ndefendant’s argument that the forensic expert’s lack of knowledge about the underlying\n\nprogramming of the Cellebrite software is fatal to his testimony’s reliability. Although we can\n\nfind no case from this Court directly on point, several other courts have taken a liberal approach\n\nin admitting testimony regarding computer software and other technical devices upon reliability\n\nfoundations similar to that laid by the State here.4\n\n\n\n       4\n           We note that some of these courts still rely on a version of the Frye “general\nacceptance” standard, or some hybrid of Frye and their own common law standards. We do not\nbelieve that this alters the applicability or persuasive value of these cases because the analyses\n                                                  10\n\f        ¶ 21.   Closely on point is United States v. Chiaradio, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2012). In\n\nChiaradio, an FBI agent testified to his investigatory technique of using an enhanced peer-to-peer\n\n(EP2P) file sharing program to identify Internet Protocol addresses where child pornography has\n\nbeen downloaded. The defendant objected to the court’s admission of the agent’s testimony\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 702 because the EP2P technology was “too untested to form an\n\nadequate foundation” for the agent’s testimony. Id. at 277. In affirming the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt, the circuit court concluded:\n\n                Although [the agent] was not a programmer, did not know the\n                program’s authors, and had never seen the source code, he had\n                significant specialized experience with both EP2P and the manual\n                re-creation of EP2P sessions. He testified that the program, with\n                respect to identifying the source of particular files, had no error\n                rate.    He also demonstrated how the results of an EP2P\n                investigation could be independently verified and made it clear that\n                EP2P had never yielded a false positive.\n\nId. at 278.\n\n        ¶ 22.   Also on point is Krause v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2356312\"><a href=\"/opinion/2356312/krause-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App. 2007). In Krause, the\n\ncourt considered the qualifications of a forensic examiner using specialized software called I-\n\nLook to create an exact duplicate of the defendant’s computer hard drive in order to search for\n\nevidence of child pornography. The forensic examiner testified that the hard drive was an exact\n\ncopy because the “Hash value”—or “fingerprint”—of the copy matched that of the original. He\n\nconceded that he was “not sure exactly how the formula or algorithm works” and did not know\n\n“from where the mathematical formula for the Hash values came.” Id. at 101. He stated,\n\nhowever, that the formula had “been approved by our headquarters and it’s the formula that we\n\nuse to get that value” and that the program “was industry standard and generally accepted in the\n\nscientific community.” Id. The defendant objected that the testimony was “not sufficiently\n\nreliable” because the forensic examiner did not know how the program reproduced the copies of\n\n\nconducted by those courts comport with the flexible principles of Daubert as applied by this\nCourt.\n                                           11\n\fthe original hard drives. Id. In approving the trial court’s admission of the testimony, the\n\nappellate court discussed the forensic examiner’s qualifications; his experience in data recovery\n\nand analysis and computer investigation; his work with the FBI; his 200 hours of training in\n\nforensic examination, including training in software programs like I-Look; and his experience\n\nconducting around 150 forensic examinations for the FBI, half of which involved I-Look. Id. at\n\n109. With respect to the reliability of the software, the court stated:\n\n                   Regarding the clarity with which the underlying scientific theory\n                 and technique can be explained to the court, [the expert] explained\n                 that he had used I-Look on computer files taken from [the\n                 defendant’s] external hard drive and computers. I-Look indexed\n                 the files, and [the expert] was able to retrieve files containing child\n                 pornography from [the defendant’s] hard drives. When [the\n                 examiner] took a hard drive from a computer, he used a program\n                 like I-Look to automate the task of searching and finding the files\n                 on it. An image of the drive was taken; the files were copied; and\n                 I-Look validated the copy by a “Hash value,” an algorithm that\n                 verifies the image. [The expert’s] testimony established I-Look’s\n                 reliability.\n\nId. at 109-10.\n\n       ¶ 23.     In reaching its conclusion, the appellate court relied on an earlier decision that we\n\nalso find instructive here. In Williford v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652217\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652217/williford-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App. 2004), the court\n\nconsidered a detective’s testimony regarding a program called EnCase, which copies data from\n\none computer hard drive to another. The defendant objected to this testimony “on the ground\n\nthat [the detective] was not qualified as an expert to testify about the theory or technique in\n\ndeveloping the EnCase software or its reliability.” Id. at 311. In approving the admission of the\n\ntestimony, the appellate court concluded the it was reliable because the detective was\n\nknowledgeable about using EnCase and had used it in the past; the software was generally\n\naccepted in the computer forensic community worldwide, had a low potential error rate, and had\n\nbeen reviewed in publications; and the accuracy of the software had been verified by the\n\ndetective and, because of its commercial availability, could be tested. Id. at 312-13; see also\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fSanders v.

Forensic investigation increasingly requires the use of computer software or other\n\ntechnological devices for the extraction of data. While an investigator must have specialized\n\nknowledge in the use of the particular software or device, it is not required—nor is it practical—\n\nfor an investigator to have expertise in or knowledge about the underlying programming,\n\nmathematical formulas, or other innerworkings of the software. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nSpringstead, 520 F. App’x 168, 169-70 (4th Cir. 2013) (approving trial court’s admission of\n\ncomputer forensic examination software, against defendant’s objection that agent “lacked the\n\nrequisite knowledge and training to explain how the [forensic] software used in this case was\n\ndesigned and functioned,” because agent testified to his training and experience with software);\n\nState v.

Returning to the testimony presented by the forensic expert, we conclude that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony. Our conclusion is supported by\n\nthe principles discussed above: our deferential, abuse-of-discretion review; the liberal\n\nadmissibility under Rule 702 and Daubert; and the flexible, nonmechanical application of the\n\nDaubert factors, specifically to nonscientific testimony.\n\n       ¶ 26.   As to the forensic expert’s qualifications, he testified that he had over 800 hours\n\nof training in the forensic examination of computer hard drives, digital media, and cell phones\n\nand a week of specific training in Cellebrite with a company that specializes in training and\n\nassistance to law enforcement. He also testified that he has used the program to extract data\n\nfrom hundreds of phones since 2010. He conceded that someone in his position would not be\n\nable to speak about the underlying programming, stating, “[W]e’re actually trained . . . to be very\n\ncareful about how we talk about how the software and hardware works . . . we’re not experts on\n\n\n\n       5\n          A handful of courts have considered testimony regarding the use of the Cellebrite\nsoftware and have ruled the testimony admissible where the witness had no knowledge of the\nprogramming behind the software. For example, in In re D.H., No. A140779, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">514336</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Cal. App. Feb. 6, 2015), the court explained that\n\n               [t]he testimony was not for the purpose of explaining how the\n               Cellebrite technology worked, and [the detective] did not opine\n               about the technological means by which the transfer occurred.\n               Instead, he essentially testified to his experience that attaching a\n               phone to his machine resulted in a display of photographic and\n               other information that was contained in the phone, and identified\n               the type of machine he used to download the material from [the\n               phone].\n\nId. at *6. Although this case supports our reasoning above, we do not find it entirely applicable\nbecause the court there held that the detective’s testimony was not expert testimony because data\nextraction is merely an “investigative technique.” Id. We consider the forensic expert’s\ntestimony here to be expert testimony because he has “specialized knowledge” about the use of\nCellebrite that is helpful to a jury.\n                                                 14\n\fthat.” He testified, however, that he read about the program, what it can do, what information it\n\ncan reveal, and how he can search and sort through the data.\n\n       ¶ 27.   As to the reliability of the program, the forensic expert testified that “numerous\n\nagencies use the software” and that it is “the most popular hardware and software solution for\n\nexamining cell phones.”     He testified that the program is routinely tested in the forensics\n\ncommunity; the results are tested in his agency by defense experts and through peer review of\n\ndata reports; and that because the program is commercially available, it is subject to testing. He\n\nalso stated that he self-tests his extraction results by comparing the computerized results to the\n\nresults of a manual examination to verify the data that has been extracted and that he compares\n\nthe results of his extraction with results from other forensic programs that overlap with\n\nCellebrite. He further stated that he has learned of the program’s reliability in the forensic\n\nindustry through his trainings, correspondence with colleagues, and email lists. He testified that,\n\nalthough the program’s error rate never was expressly discussed in his training, the program’s\n\nlimitations were.\n\n       ¶ 28.   The trial court concluded that the testimony was sufficiently reliable to meet the\n\nrequirements of Rule 702. The court focused specifically on the forensic expert’s training and\n\nexperience with Cellebrite, the software’s widespread use by law enforcement nationally, and\n\nthat the expert verified the accuracy of the data extraction through testing against manual\n\nextraction and other software programs. In response to defendant’s specific concern about the\n\nforensic expert’s lack of knowledge at the “programmatic level,” the court explained that such\n\nprogramming information is rarely understood by its users because it is “typically highly\n\nproprietary information known only to the manufacturer of the product.”\n\n       ¶ 29.   As the above-cited cases demonstrate, this is precisely the type of inquiry that\n\nestablishes the reliability of such technical evidence. A computer program for extracting cell\n\nphone data is hardly novel. While this particular program has not been the subject of many court\n\n                                                15\n\fdecisions, its reliability clearly has been established through the forensic expert’s foundational\n\ntestimony, and his qualifications to present such testimony, and through evaluation of similar\n\ntechnical evidence by this Court and others. And as discussed above, the State was not obligated\n\nto present evidence on each Daubert factor. The forensic expert’s testimony is not about basic\n\nscientific principles, and he is not drawing inferences from the facts. He merely is explaining\n\nhow he extracted the data from the cell phone and how he read that data—specialized knowledge\n\nthat he acquired through his training and experience. Many of the Daubert factors—and the\n\nheightened scrutiny given to scientific evidence—are impractical here and would do little to\n\ndraw out the reliability of Cellebrite. See Broun, supra, § 13 (explaining that when testimony\n\nsummarizes or describes experience in field, rather than drawing inferences from facts based on\n\nscientific theories or techniques, foundation that demonstrates expert’s experience in field may\n\nbe sufficient).\n\n        ¶ 30.     Furthermore, any deficiencies in the program should be drawn out through the\n\nadversarial process, including “vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence,\n\nand careful instruction on the burden of proof.” Daewoo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057376\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057376/985-assocs-ltd-v-daewoo-electronics-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 16 (quoting Daubert,\n\n509 U.S. at 596).       “So long as scientific or technical evidence has a sound factual and\n\nmethodological basis and is relevant to the issues at hand, it is within the purview of the trier of\n\nfact to assess its credibility and determine the weight to be assigned to it.” Id. As the trial court\n\nhere noted, the fact that the Cellebrite software did not extract all the data from defendant’s cell\n\nphone does not affect the admissibility of the testimony but instead goes to the weight of that\n\ntestimony. Counsel for defendant had access to the cell phone and had the opportunity to have it\n\nscanned by his own computer experts. The trial court here properly exercised its discretion as\n\ngatekeeper; the software used by the forensic expert hardly can be characterized as “junk\n\nscience.” It is left to the fact finder to weigh its credibility.\n\n\n\n                                                    16\n\f       ¶ 31.   Finally, we note that, although the State argued this issue based on Rule 702, and\n\nthe trial court conducted its analysis on that basis, defendant’s claim that the forensic expert’s\n\ntestimony is unreliable because he lacked a general understanding of the programming behind\n\nthe software also can be framed as a Vermont Rule of Evidence 703 issue not requiring Daubert\n\nanalysis at this point in the case. Rule 703 permits experts to base their opinions on facts or data\n\n“of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or\n\ninferences upon the subject,” V.R.E. 703, and “the facts or data need not be admissible in\n\nevidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted.” Id. The Reporter’s Notes to Rule\n\n703 explain that the rule is identical to the federal rule and is intended, in part, to allow\n\nadmission of data presented to the expert “outside the trial and not reflecting his personal\n\nexperience.” Reporter’s Notes, V.R.E. 703. The Reporter’s Notes to the concomitant federal\n\nrule further explain that “the rule is designed to broaden the basis for expert opinions . . . and to\n\nbring the judicial practice into line with the practice of the experts themselves when not in\n\ncourt.” Advisory Committee Notes, F.R.E. 703.\n\n       ¶ 32.

Defendant makes one final argument as to the admissibility of the expert\n\ntestimony. He contends that the State failed to establish a sufficient chain of custody for\n\ndefendant’s cell phone, specifically that the forensic expert could not account for its whereabouts\n\nat all times before it reached his office and acknowledged that the phone was stored improperly\n\nfor some period of time. We note that this is not a Rule 702 issue, State v. Tester, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057301\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057301/state-v-tester/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n¶ 18, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057301\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057301/state-v-tester/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, but merely one of admissibility and authentication of evidence\n\ngenerally, State v.

We do not require absolute certainty\n\nin laying a foundation for admissibility but require that “the evidence be of demonstrable\n\nrelevance and of sufficient meaningful substance to be justifiably relied upon” and not “an\n\ninsubstantial invitation to conjecture.” Id. (quotation omitted). Furthermore, a chain of custody\n\nneed not be established perfectly; imperfections go to the weight, not the admissibility. State v.\n\nMercier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1981828\"><a href=\"/opinion/1981828/state-v-mecier/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (1980). Rather, the circumstances need to\n\nestablish only a “reasonable assurance” that the evidence is authentic and has not been tampered\n\nwith. State v. Stevens, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2295643\"><a href=\"/opinion/2295643/state-v-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (1979).\n\n       ¶ 34.   The forensic expert testified that the cell phone was sent from defendant’s home\n\nto the barracks in New Haven and then to his office where it was stored in the evidence room.\n\nHe acknowledged that he did not know exactly what happened to the phone between leaving\n\ndefendant’s possession and arriving at his office and also acknowledged that it had been stored\n\nimproperly (turned on) at some point before reaching his office. He also testified, however, that\n\nthe fact that the phone was left on had no effect on the data he subsequently extracted from the\n\nphone. There is no evidence of a break in the chain of custody, and other than the phone being\n\nleft on, there is no other evidence to suggest tampering.\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f       ¶ 35.   We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting\n\nthe forensic expert’s testimony regarding the extraction of data from defendant’s cell phone.\n\n       ¶ 36.   Lastly, we turn to defendant’s claim that the jury verdict was coerced. Defendant\n\nargues that the trial court improperly coerced a jury verdict when it informed the jury that they\n\nwould have two hours that day to deliberate and then added: “but if you don’t have a verdict by\n\n5:30 that’s fine, but we will then suspend and have you back on Monday.” The court also\n\nadvised the jury “to take all the time you need.” Defendant’s complaint is that the court should\n\nhave given the jury a choice to start deliberations that day or wait until Monday. Defendant\n\nbears the burden of presenting facts sufficient to support his claim that the verdict was coerced.\n\nState v. Hudson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536 (1995).\n\n       ¶ 37.   In support of his argument, defendant cites a litany of cases that stand for the\n\nproposition that a court cannot place time limits on a jury’s deliberations or in any way indicate\n\nthat speed is more important than thoughtfulness. None of those cases support a finding of\n\ncoercion here. In Hudson, we rejected the defendant’s claim that the court improperly coerced a\n\njury verdict by informing the jurors that they would be sent to a hotel if they did not reach a\n\nverdict by 10:00 p.m. Id. at 323, 658 A.2d at 535. We explained that the court already had\n\nadvised the jurors to be prepared to stay overnight and “made it clear that it did not intend to\n\nsuggest that it was imposing a time limit for reaching a verdict.” Id. at 324, 658 A.2d at 536; see\n\nState v. James, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1839353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1839353/state-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 727 (La. Ct. App. 1986) (finding no error where jurors were\n\ninformed they would spend night in hotel if verdict was not reached because “the jury members\n\nwere entitled to know . . . what would happen if they could not reach a verdict that night”).\n\n       ¶ 38.   Here, we see no coercion in the trial court’s statement to the jury. The court never\n\ntold the jury that it must reach a decision that night. The court merely was explaining the fact\n\nthat it was the end of the week and that deliberations would resume on Monday if necessary—\n\nthis is something the jury members were entitled to know. Further, the court stressed that it was\n\n                                                19\n\f“fine” if the jurors did not reach a decision by the end of the day and told them to “take all the\n\ntime you need.”     We also fail to see how explicitly giving the jury a choice of starting\n\ndeliberations on Friday or waiting until Monday would make any practical difference in how the\n\njury approaches deliberations. We therefore find no error in the trial court’s statement to the\n\njury.\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                              FOR THE COURT:\n\n\n\n                                              Associate Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\f</pre>",
