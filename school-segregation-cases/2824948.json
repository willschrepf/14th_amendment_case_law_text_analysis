The representatives of Cleavenger and his\nfamily filed a broad complaint for damages against all of the health-\ncare providers involved in Cleavenger’s care, as well as against the\ncompanies insuring and managing Cleavenger’s healthcare benefits\nprovided by his employer. Their complaint, filed in a West Virginia\nState court, alleged medical malpractice, negligent supervision, negli-\ngent monitoring, negligent healthcare management, and vicarious lia-\nbility, all under the State law of West Virginia.\n\n   Cleavenger’s healthcare insurer removed the case to federal court\nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441 and 1331, asserting that the claims against\nit and related defendants were \"completely preempted\" by § 502(a) of\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). The plain-\ntiffs moved to remand the case to State court on the ground that their\nclaims challenged mixed decisions of plan administration and patient\ntreatment and that, under Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211 (2000),\nsuch claims are not preempted by ERISA. The district court denied\nthe plaintiffs’ motion to remand because their claims against the\nhealthcare insurers challenged purely administrative decisions under\nthe plan and were thus completely preempted by ERISA. The district\ncourt then considered the merits of plaintiffs’ preempted claims,\nwhich it treated as ERISA claims, and entered summary judgment\nagainst the plaintiffs on those claims. Finally, the court remanded the\nremaining state-law claims to State court.\n\n  On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge (1) the district court’s order\ndenying their motion to remand and (2) the district court’s summary\n\f4                         MARKS v. WATTERS\njudgment on the ERISA claims. For the reasons that follow, we\naffirm.\n\n                                    I\n\n   Robert Cleavenger was employed by Mountaineer Retreading, Inc.\nin Clarksburg, West Virginia, and in connection with his employment,\nMountaineer Retreading provided Cleavenger employee benefits,\nincluding healthcare benefits through a preferred provider organiza-\ntion plan (a \"PPO plan\") insured by Health Assurance. For the premi-\nums paid, Health Assurance agreed to pay Mountaineer Retreading’s\nemployees for 100% of the costs of medical care provided to them by\nparticipating healthcare providers — those who agreed to offer\nhealthcare pursuant to a fee schedule — and 80% of the costs of care\nprovided by nonparticipating providers. Cleavenger’s PPO plan,\nwhich detailed the scope of coverage as well as its limitations, pro-\nvided coverage for mental illness, including coverage for 45 days in\nan inpatient mental health facility and outpatient psychiatric consulta-\ntions.\n\n   Health Assurance subcontracted with Managed Care Services\nMainstay of Central Pennsylvania, Inc. (\"Mainstay\") to manage the\nbehavioral healthcare component of its PPO plan. This subcontract\nrequired Mainstay to provide \"certain mental health and chemical\ndependency outpatient and inpatient professional and technical ser-\nvices and related provider contracting and credentialing, utilization\nmanagement and quality improvement services.\" These services that\nMainstay undertook to provide included determinations of employee\neligibility, the medical necessity of services, the resolution of griev-\nances, and claims payment. Mainstay provided these services to\nemployees through case managers whom they designated in connec-\ntion with each claim. In this case, Mainstay designated Shelley Watt-\ners as the case manager to perform utilization review services in\nconnection with Cleavenger’s treatment.\n\n   In October 1998, while covered by his employee benefit plan,\nCleavenger was hospitalized at the William R. Sharpe, Jr. Hospital\n(\"Sharpe Hospital\") in Weston, West Virginia, after he attempted sui-\ncide by ingesting three bottles of pills and slitting his wrist. His sui-\ncide attempt came shortly after he assaulted his wife upon learning\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                           5\nthat she was having an affair with another man. He wrote a suicide\nnote describing his inability to bear the pain of his wife’s rejection.\nCleavenger was rushed to the emergency room, treated, and involun-\ntarily committed to Sharpe Hospital for monitoring and treatment.\n\n   At Sharpe Hospital, Cleavenger received four days of inpatient\ntreatment for depression. After he was admitted, Mary Ann Iquinto,\na Sharpe Hospital nurse, called Cleavenger’s insurer to determine\nCleavenger’s insurance coverage, as she routinely did for newly\nadmitted patients. Health Assurance referred Iquinto to Mainstay and\nto Shelley Watters. After learning of Cleavenger’s suicide attempt and\nself-injurious behavior, Watters authorized payment to Sharpe Hospi-\ntal for Cleavenger’s inpatient services. She also told Iquinto that\nbecause Sharpe Hospital was not a participating provider under Clea-\nvenger’s insurance policy, Cleavenger would be responsible for a\n20% co-pay.\n\n   The next day, October 7, 1998, Watters called Iquinto to inquire\nabout Cleavenger’s condition and was advised that Cleavenger\nremained on a suicide watch and that Sharpe Hospital planned to con-\ntinue to monitor him closely to see if he would stabilize and to\nincrease his social interaction. During the conversation, Watters\nauthorized payment for Cleavenger’s continued inpatient care.\n\n   Dr. Ahmed Aboraya, Cleavenger’s treating physician at Sharpe\nHospital, observed that over the next two days Cleavenger was doing\n\"fairly well,\" and he stopped the 15-minute checks made as part of the\nsuicide watch. He also noted Cleavenger was neither delusional nor\npsychotic and that he no longer posed a risk of harm to himself or oth-\ners.\n\n   After the first couple of days in the hospital, Cleavenger began to\nexpress concern to Dr. Aboraya that if he stayed in the hospital too\nlong he would lose his job. Dr. Aboraya noted that it was Clea-\nvenger’s \"will and his request that he want[ed] to go home and con-\ntinue to his job and continue the therapy as an outpatient.\" Based on\nCleavenger’s improved condition, Dr. Aboraya did not believe that\nthe hospital could keep Cleavenger against his will. Dr. Aboraya met\nwith a team of nurses and a social worker, explained that Cleavenger\nrequested discharge, and asked whether there were any concerns\n\f6                         MARKS v. WATTERS\nabout releasing him. Everybody on the team agreed that, under West\nVirginia law, there was no basis for holding Cleavenger against his\nwill, and so Dr. Aboraya noted on Cleavenger’s chart, \"Discharge the\npatient on Friday [October 9, 1998].\" Dr. Pollard, a Sharpe Hospital\ndoctor who observed Cleavenger and who had the authority to over-\nride Dr. Aboraya’s discharge decision, agreed with Dr. Aboraya’s\ndecision.\n\n   Cleavenger was released on Friday, October 9, 1998, from Sharpe\nHospital. Florence Hatton, the social worker on the unit at that time,\nwrote up a psychological assessment of Cleavenger and a plan for his\noutpatient care. Dr. Aboraya had only specified that Cleavenger\nneeded a psychologist who specialized in marital problems, and he\ndid not specify where Cleavenger should go for outpatient care. He\nleft that decision to Florence Hatton. Although both Valley Commu-\nnity Mental Health Center, Inc. (\"Valley Center\") and University\nHealth Associates at Chestnut Ridge Hospital (\"University Asso-\nciates\") were options for outpatient care — and both were, in Dr.\nAboraya’s estimation, \"similar clinics\" — Hatton noted that Clea-\nvenger \"stated he did not want to go to Valley [Center],\" even though\nit was the facility closer to Cleavenger’s residence. Hatton thus con-\ntacted University Associates and set up an appointment for Clea-\nvenger for October 12, 1998.\n\n   Watters, who had learned that Cleavenger was being released, sent\nCleavenger a letter, introducing herself as his case manager and indi-\ncating that she would continue to follow his treatment after discharge\nand contact him by telephone to assess his post-hospitalization status.\nShe also learned that Sharpe Hospital had set up an appointment for\nCleavenger at University Associates for October 12. After October\n12, Watters called Cleavenger to determine whether he had kept his\nappointment at University Associates, but Cleavenger never returned\nher call. Watters’ October 15 notes indicate that University Associates\ntold her that Cleavenger kept his first appointment, although Univer-\nsity Associates doubts that they would have communicated that infor-\nmation, as Cleavenger never showed up. Watters continued to attempt\nto reach Cleavenger but to no avail. Having not heard from him and\nassuming that Cleavenger was keeping his appointments, Watters\nclosed her file on Cleavenger.\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                             7\n   In fact, on the day of his release from the hospital, Cleavenger con-\ntacted University Associates to change his outpatient appointment that\nwas scheduled for October 12 because it conflicted with his return to\nwork. Cleavenger also postponed his next appointment on October 16\nin order to take his son to the dentist. One day later, on October 17,\n1998, Cleavenger killed his wife and daughter with a knife, injured\nhis son, and committed suicide by jumping head first from a second-\nstory window of the family’s home.\n\n   The plaintiffs, who are representatives of the estates of Cleavenger,\nhis wife, and his daughter, as well as the guardian of his surviving\nson, commenced this action for damages in State court, asserting vari-\nous state-law claims of negligence and vicarious liability against doc-\ntors, healthcare organizations, and insurance-related entities based on\nthe decision to release Cleavenger from the hospital to outpatient\ncare. In their complaint against Watters, the plaintiffs alleged that she\nwas negligent in\n\n    a) failing to adequately monitor Robert Cleavenger during\n    his out-patient treatment; b) failing to obtain or otherwise\n    cause the readmission of Robert Cleavenger to the Sharpe\n    Hospital or other inpatient facility once it became apparent\n    that Robert Cleavenger was non-compliant with out-patient\n    treatment services designed to monitor his recovery from his\n    mental illness; and c) failing to provide adequate warnings\n    to Robert Cleavenger’s family members, who were foresee-\n    able victims of Robert Cleavenger’s mental illness, as to\n    signs and symptoms of Robert Cleavenger’s remission.\n\nTheir complaint against Mainstay alleged only that Mainstay was\nvicariously liable for Watters’ negligence. Plaintiffs sought damages\nfor funeral and medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost earn-\nings, among other things.\n\n   After Health Assurance, with the consent of the other defendants,\nremoved this case to federal court on the ground that the claims\nagainst it as well as Mainstay and Watters were preempted by ERISA,\nplaintiffs filed a motion to remand this case to State court, arguing\nthat Mainstay and Watters had an active role in \"the decision as to the\ntype and quality of health care Robert Cleavenger received in October\n\f8                         MARKS v. WATTERS\nof 1998\" and that such mixed decisions involving both eligibility for\ncoverage and treatment were not subject to preemption under ERISA,\nbut rather were subject to state-law malpractice jurisprudence. The\ndistrict court rejected that argument and denied plaintiffs’ motion to\nremand, concluding that because plaintiffs’ case against Mainstay and\nWatters \"related to the administration of plan benefits, and not to the\nprovision of medical care,\" it had to be brought under ERISA, if at\nall. The court concluded:\n\n    [P]laintiffs cannot escape the facts that Mainstay never pur-\n    ported to provide Cleavenger with medical services, that\n    Cleavenger’s treating physicians were fully insulated from\n    the utilization review procedures performed by Mainstay,\n    and that Watters never spoke directly with Cleavenger’s\n    physicians and had no input into Cleavenger’s referral to\n    outpatient care. Cleavenger was discharged and referred to\n    outpatient therapy not because of a Mainstay policy that\n    determined level of care, but because his treating physicians\n    concluded that was the most appropriate level of treatment.\n    It was the treating physicians at Sharpe who were the\n    arrangers of Cleavenger’s care, not Mainstay or Shelley\n    Watters. Mainstay was performing a purely administrative\n    role.\n\n                                ***\n\n      At bottom, plaintiffs’ claims against Shelley Watters and\n    Mainstay attack the administration of Cleavenger’s benefits.\n    Plaintiffs essentially complain that the administration of the\n    PPO Plan led to Cleavenger’s being referred to outpatient\n    care. These claims go to plan administration, not provision\n    of medical services.\n\nThe district court also concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish a\nclaim under ERISA and entered summary judgment against them.\n\n  From the district court’s orders denying remand and granting sum-\nmary judgment to Mainstay and Watters, the plaintiffs filed this\nappeal.\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                           9\n                                  II\n\n   Plaintiffs’ principal argument on appeal is that the district court\nerred in concluding that their state-law claims against Mainstay and\nWatters were preempted by ERISA and in denying their motion to\nremand this case to State court on that basis. They contend that\nERISA does not preempt their claims against Mainstay and Watters\nbecause these claims challenge \"mixed eligibility and treatment\" deci-\nsions — i.e., decisions in which plan administration and medical\njudgment are inextricably intertwined. Such mixed eligibility and\ntreatment claims, they assert, remain state-law claims and are not pre-\nempted by ERISA under the rationale of Pegram v. Herdrich, 530\nU.S. 211, 235 (2000) (holding that a claim of fiduciary breach by an\nHMO physician making a mixed decision of eligibility and treatment\n\"boil[s] down to a malpractice claim, and the fiduciary standard could\nbe nothing but the malpractice standard traditionally applied in\nactions against physicians\" so that ERISA would not govern such a\nclaim).\n\n   We begin by reviewing the nature and scope of ERISA’s preemp-\ntion generally. ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of partici-\npants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by, among\nother things, \"establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and\nobligation for fiduciaries of employment benefit plans, and by provid-\ning for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Fed-\neral courts.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1001(b). Its regulation \"extends to [plans]\nthat provide ‘medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits’ for plan\nparticipants or their beneficiaries ‘through the purchase of insurance\nor otherwise.’\" New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue\nShield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 650-51 (1995) (quot-\ning ERISA § 3(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1)). Recognizing \"the reservation\nto Federal authority [of] the sole power to regulate the field of\nemployee benefit plans as ERISA’s crowning achievement,\" the legis-\nlation’s sponsors \"emphasized both the breadth and importance of the\npre-emption provisions\" to \"establish pension plan regulation as\nexclusively a federal concern.\" Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481\nU.S. 41, 46 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nThus, § 514(a) of ERISA provides that ERISA \"shall supersede any\nand all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any\nemployee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). This \"broad\" and \"ex-\n\f10                        MARKS v. WATTERS\npansive\" preemption clause, Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 47, thus provides\na federal law defense to all common-law causes of action that \"relate\nto\" an employee benefit plan, unless ERISA expressly excepts the\ncause of action from ERISA’s preemption provision, id. at 48.\n\n   Having preempted a field defined by claims relating to an ERISA\nplan, ERISA precludes the prosecution of preempted state-law claims\nthat are not otherwise saved from preemption under § 514(b)(2)(A)\nunless they fall within the scope of the exclusive civil enforcement\nmechanism provided by § 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), in\nwhich case they must be treated as federal causes of action under\n§ 502(a). Section 502(a) authorizes participants or beneficiaries to file\ncivil actions to, among other things, recover benefits, enforce rights\nconferred by an ERISA plan, remedy breaches of fiduciary duty, clar-\nify rights to benefits, and enjoin violations of ERISA. Thus, if a state-\nlaw claim preempted by § 514 is not included within the scope of\n§ 502(a), the claim is susceptible to a § 514 defense, whether it is\nbrought in State or federal court. But if a state-law claim falls within\nthe scope of § 502(a), it is \"completely preempted\" and therefore\ntreated as a federal cause of action. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.\nTaylor, 481 U.S. 58, 66-67 (1987).\n\n   Stated otherwise, under the scheme established by Congress,\nERISA § 514 preempts a field defined by claims relating to employee\nbenefit plans regulated by ERISA that are not otherwise subject to\nERISA’s saving clause and, once having occupied that field, limits\ncivil enforcement to claims provided in § 502(a). Any claim falling\nwithin the field but not within the scope of § 502(a) is preempted and\nmust be dismissed, and any claim falling within the scope of § 502(a)\nbecomes exclusively a federal cause of action. Thus, simple preemp-\ntion under § 514 precludes prosecution of the preempted state-law\nclaim, but \"complete preemption\" exists when the preempted state-\nlaw claim falls within the scope of the exclusive civil enforcement\nmechanism of § 502, in which case the state-law claim is converted\ninto a federal cause of action removable to federal court. Metropolitan\nLife, 481 U.S. at 66-67; see also In re U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 193 F.3d\n151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999) (\"It is important to distinguish complete pre-\nemption under § 502(a) of ERISA, which is used in this sense as a\njurisdictional concept, from express preemption under § 514(a) of\nERISA, which is a substantive concept governing the applicable\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                            11\nlaw\"); Warner v. Ford Motor Co., 46 F.3d 531, 535 (6th Cir. 1995)\n(\"Removal and preemption are two distinct concepts\").\n\n   Because a state-law claim that is completely preempted under\n§ 502(a) becomes a federal cause of action, it may be removed to fed-\neral court under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1441 even if it is pleaded only\nas a state-law claim. As the Supreme Court explained in Metropolitan\nLife,\n\n    Federal pre-emption is ordinarily a federal defense to the\n    plaintiff’s suit. As a defense, it does not appear on the face\n    of a well-pleaded complaint, and, therefore, does not autho-\n    rize removal to a federal court. Gully v. First National Bank,\n    [299 U.S. 109 (1936)]. One corollary of the well-pleaded\n    complaint rule developed in the case law, however, is that\n    Congress may so completely pre-empt a particular area that\n    any civil complaint raising this select group of claims\n    [within the scope of § 502(a)] is necessarily federal in char-\n    acter.\n\n481 U.S. at 63-64.\n\n   Accordingly, the question presented in this case is whether the\nplaintiffs’ claims against Mainstay and Watters fell within the scope\nof § 502(a). If they did, then their claims were properly treated as fed-\neral causes of action and their removal to federal court was appropri-\nate. On the other hand, if they did not fall within the scope of\n§ 502(a), then their remand to State court would be required, even\nthough § 514 might provide a defense to them in State court.\n\n   We now turn to plaintiffs’ claims and begin by noting that plain-\ntiffs have conceded that they are beneficiaries or participants under an\nemployee benefit plan provided by Mountaineer Retreading, Inc. to\nRobert Cleavenger, one of its employees. They also concede that\nthere is no dispute that the inpatient and outpatient care that is\ninvolved in this action was \"covered under Mr. Cleavenger’s health\ncare plan\" provided by Mountaineer Retreading and that the plan was\nregulated by ERISA. Finally, they recognize that Cleavenger’s bene-\nfits for mental illness were managed by Mainstay pursuant to a con-\ntractual arrangement between it and the plan.\n\f12                        MARKS v. WATTERS\n   Plaintiffs’ argument focuses on the contention that their claims\nagainst Mainstay and Watters arise out of \"mixed eligibility and treat-\nment decisions\" made by Mainstay and Watters. They argue that such\nmixed eligibility and treatment decisions are governed by State law\nunder the holding of Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211 (2000), which\nessentially held that duties exercised in such mixed decisions arise\nfrom State common-law malpractice jurisprudence, which Congress\ndid not preempt under § 514 of ERISA.\n\n   In Pegram, the Supreme Court considered an HMO’s simultaneous\nduties as both an ERISA plan administrator and a healthcare provider,\nrecognizing that in acting as a plan administrator, an HMO functions\nas a plan fiduciary regulated by ERISA and that in providing treat-\nment of a patient’s medical conditions, the HMO functions as a\nhealthcare provider regulated by State malpractice jurisprudence.\nAnalyzing this \"dual medical/administrative role[ ] of HMOs,\" the\nSupreme Court concluded that an HMO’s activities can be placed into\nthree categories: (1) pure administrative eligibility decisions, (2)\nmixed eligibility and treatment decisions, and (3) pure treatment deci-\nsions. Pegram, 530 U.S. at 228-29. Pure eligibility decisions relate to\n\"the plan’s coverage of a particular condition or medical procedure\nfor its treatment.\" Id. at 228. \"‘Treatment decisions,’ by contrast, are\nchoices about how to go about diagnosing and treating a patient’s\ncondition: given a patient’s constellation of symptoms, what is the\nappropriate medical response?\" Id. Mixed eligibility and treatment\ndecisions exist when those two decisions are \"practically inextricable\nfrom one another\" such that \"eligibility decisions cannot be untangled\nfrom physicians’ judgments about reasonable medical treatment.\" Id.\nat 228-29. The Court noted that while an HMO acts as an ERISA\nfiduciary when making pure eligibility decisions, it does not act as an\nERISA fiduciary when making pure treatment decisions. Addressing\nthe third category, the Court held that Congress did not intend for any\nHMO \"to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed\neligibility decisions acting through its physicians.\" Id. at 231. The\nCourt explained that \"for all practical purposes, every claim of fidu-\nciary breach by an HMO physician making a mixed decision would\nboil down to a malpractice claim, and the fiduciary standard would\nbe nothing but the malpractice standard traditionally applied in\nactions against physicians.\" Id. at 235. The Court thus concluded that\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                              13\n\"mixed eligibility decisions by HMO physicians are not fiduciary\ndecisions under ERISA.\" Id. at 237.\n\n   Under the teaching of Pegram, when an HMO diagnoses and treats\na patient’s condition with an appropriate medical response, even if it\nis at the same time also making an eligibility determination, it does\nnot act as a fiduciary under ERISA because the mixed eligibility and\ntreatment decisions as a practical matter reduce to the stuff of State\nmalpractice claims and not to traditional breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims. But when an HMO acts as a fiduciary in relation to an ERISA\nplan, performing the functions of a fiduciary as defined in ERISA,\nthen a claim against it for breach of that fiduciary duty must be\nbrought exclusively under ERISA.\n\n   A person undertaking to act as a fiduciary under ERISA is required\nto \"discharge his duties with respect to [an ERISA] plan solely in the\ninterest of participants and beneficiaries,\" for the exclusive purpose\nof \"(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and\n(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" 29\nU.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A). A person functions as a fiduciary only\n\n    to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or\n    discretionary control respecting management of [a] plan or\n    exercises any authority or control respecting management or\n    disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for\n    a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect\n    to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any\n    authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discre-\n    tionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the\n    administration of such plan.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A). Thus, to the extent that a civil complaint\nchallenges the conduct of a fiduciary, as defined in ERISA and\nexplained by Pegram, the complaint must be brought under § 502(a)\nof ERISA, or not at all.\n\n   In this case, Mainstay was a contractor hired by Health Assurance\nto manage, as a utilization review agent, the behavioral healthcare\ncomponent of its PPO health plan issued to Mountaineer Retreading.\nHealth Assurance was not an HMO but a preferred provider organiza-\n\f14                       MARKS v. WATTERS\ntion or PPO that provided reimbursement for healthcare coverage sup-\nplied by third parties. Under the plan, Cleavenger, as a covered\nemployee, was free to choose his own healthcare providers. If he\nchose a participating provider — one who had a contractual arrange-\nment with Health Assurance or Mainstay to provide healthcare to\ninsureds at an agreed-upon fee schedule — then Health Assurance\nwould pay 100% of the cost of services rendered to Cleavenger. If,\non the other hand, Cleavenger chose to go outside the network estab-\nlished by Health Assurance, Health Assurance agreed to pay 80% of\nthe usual and customary charges and Cleavenger would become\nresponsible for the remaining 20%.\n\n   Under its contract with Health Assurance, Mainstay did not treat\npatients. Rather, it managed Cleavenger’s utilization of healthcare\nprovided by others to accommodate the benefits of the plan. Thus, it\nagreed to perform network development, credentialing of healthcare\nproviders, utilization review, and quality assurance functions in the\narea of behavioral healthcare. And under its utilization review pro-\ncess, Mainstay supplied case managers, such as Shelley Watters, to\nconfirm with healthcare providers that the healthcare being delivered\nor proposed was approved for payment under the patient’s healthcare\nplan. The case managers, however, had no authority to decline\napproval for payment. If a case manager was unable to confirm cover-\nage upon reviewing the specifics of the patient’s healthcare plan and\nthe applicable medical necessity criteria, the case manager was\nrequired to refer the matter to Mainstay’s medical director. Most\nimportantly to this case, Shelley Watters was never engaged to actu-\nally provide treatment or to make treatment decisions for Cleavenger.\nAnd for this reason, the district court concluded that, based on the\nrecord before it, \"Mainstay never purported to provide Cleavenger\nwith medical services, that Cleavenger’s treating physicians were\nfully insulated from the utilization review procedures performed by\nMainstay, and that Watters never spoke directly with Cleavenger’s\nphysicians and had no input into Cleavenger’s referral to outpatient\ncare.\"\n\n   Cleavenger’s estate and representatives of his family as beneficia-\nries filed their claims against Watters for negligence in the perfor-\nmance of services as a case manager for Mainstay. Although the\ncomplaint also attributes to Watters negligent medical treatment deci-\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                           15\nsions, the record indisputably establishes that Watters was never\nengaged as a provider of medical treatment and that she never made\na treatment decision. Indeed, there is no evidence that she even talked\nwith the doctors who did treat Cleavenger. Stated otherwise, there\nwas no evidence that eligibility decisions made by Watters as an inde-\npendent utilization review agent for Health Assurance were \"practi-\ncally inextricable\" from the treatment decisions made by\nCleavenger’s physicians such that one could conclude that Watters’\ndecisions amounted to mixed eligibility and treatment decisions.\nIndeed, the record demonstrates that the physician treating Clea-\nvenger neither spoke to Watters nor had even heard of Mainstay.\nThus, as the Supreme Court noted in Pegram, even though the dis-\ntinction between pure eligibility decisions and treatment decisions\nmay tend to blur when the treating physician is also responsible for\nmaking eligibility decisions, as is the case in a traditional HMO, that\nis not the case here where the treating physicians and Watters were\ninstitutionally segregated from one another. Watters worked for an\nindependent utilization review agent that was under contract with\nHealth Assurance, a PPO, and the treating physicians were simply\nemployed by, or connected with, the hospital to which Cleavenger\nwas admitted. Under this arrangement, treatment decisions and eligi-\nbility decisions were made by different people at different times\naccording to different policies. Indeed, in this case Mary Ann Iquinto\nof Sharpe Hospital apprised Watters of medical treatment decisions\nand diagnoses only after the doctors had already made them.\n\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that Watters or Mainstay had covert or\nundisclosed communications with any of Cleavenger’s healthcare\nproviders. Rather, they argue that Watters’ administration of the plan\nhad the effect of causing the healthcare providers to discharge Clea-\nvenger prematurely. They also allege maladministration of the plan to\nthe extent that Cleavenger’s referral to the outpatient facility at Uni-\nversity Associates amounted to a violation of Mainstay’s \"geographic\naccessibility standards,\" which elaborate a preference for referring\npatients to the nearest outpatient facilities. They additionally allege\nthat Watters’ conduct was deficient because she did not properly fol-\nlow up on Cleavenger’s outpatient progress as required by the plan.\nAll of these claims, however, attack only Watters’ administration of\nthe plan.\n\f16                        MARKS v. WATTERS\n    Claims challenging the administration of an employee welfare ben-\nefit plan fall squarely within the scope of § 502(a) of ERISA. Such\nclaims include allegations that a plan benefit was denied based on\nnoncompliance with the terms of a plan or allegations that an ERISA\nfiduciary breached a duty to a plaintiff by improperly denying a bene-\nfit based solely on financial motivations. The core allegation underly-\ning a § 502(a) claim is that a plan participant or beneficiary was\ndenied a benefit to which the participant or beneficiary was entitled\nunder an ERISA plan or that the manner of administering the benefits\ncaused the participants or beneficiaries some injury. These are pre-\ncisely the types of claims that plaintiffs are making against Watters\nand, vicariously, against Mainstay. Plaintiffs cannot transform what\nis properly considered a § 502(a) claim into a state-law claim for mal-\npractice simply by making unsubstantiated and incorrect statements\nthat an independent utilization review agent was responsible for medi-\ncal decisions.\n\n   In sum, we conclude that plaintiffs’ claims are claims for malad-\nministration against Mainstay and Watters that fall within the scope\nof § 502(a) of ERISA and therefore were properly treated as federal\nclaims and removed to federal court. Accordingly, we affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s order based on the doctrine of complete preemption,\ndenying the plaintiffs’ motion to remand this case to State court.\n\n                                  III\n\n   Taking plaintiffs’ claims as claims for breach of fiduciary duty\nunder § 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), we must still deter-\nmine whether the district court erred in entering summary judgment\nin favor of Watters and Mainstay for an alleged violation of ERISA.\nWe conclude that the district court did not err.\n\n   Plaintiffs have offered nothing more than innuendo to support a\nclaim of wrongdoing by Watters and Mainstay. They argue, for exam-\nple, that through Watters’ administration of the plan, Mainstay chan-\nneled Cleavenger to University Associates rather than the more local\nfacility, Valley Center: \"It is clear that the reason why Mainstay pro-\ncured Robert Cleavenger’s referral to a lower level of care at [Univer-\nsity Associates] was motivated by financial considerations . . . . Dr.\nWallendjack specifically testified that referring members to a partici-\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                          17\npating provider inures to the benefit of the PPO.\" To support this\nargument, plaintiffs pulled selected references from the record, such\nas a handwritten note with the words \"non-par[ticipating]\" next to\nValley Center, to suggest that Valley Center was not a participating\nprovider in the Health Assurance network, while University Asso-\nciates was. Plaintiffs’ assertion, however, is disingenuous, because in\nfact, both University Associates and Valley Center were participating\nproviders in October 1998. When faced with this fact at oral argu-\nment, plaintiffs’ counsel revised their position, arguing that Watters\nand Mainstay channeled Cleavenger away from Valley Center\nbecause, although it was a participating provider, Watters and Main-\nstay thought it was not. This argument, too, is supported by nothing\nmore than innuendo.\n\n   The uncontroverted facts support both that Cleavenger insisted on\nleaving Sharpe Hospital to return to work and that he expressed a\npreference for the further-away outpatient facility. Cleavenger was\nonly released from Sharpe Hospital after a team of doctors, nurses,\nand a social worker determined that he could not legally be kept\nagainst his will based on his medical condition at the time. The thrust\nof plaintiffs’ complaint is directed at this medical decision made by\nother defendants and not against the administration provided by Watt-\ners and Mainstay. Whether plaintiffs can establish a breach of duty\ngiving rise to malpractice against defendants other than Mainstay and\nWatters for releasing Cleavenger and sending him to University Asso-\nciates is a question on which we express no opinion because that\nforms the core of plaintiffs’ State malpractice claims against the\nhealthcare providers. We only conclude that, on the record before us,\nthe facts do not support a claim that Mainstay and Watters breached\nany fiduciary duty in violation of ERISA.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s order granting sum-\nmary judgment to Watters and Mainstay is affirmed.\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED\n\f",

The representatives of Cleavenger and his\nfamily filed a broad complaint for damages against all of the health-\ncare providers involved in Cleavenger’s care, as well as against the\ncompanies insuring and managing Cleavenger’s healthcare benefits\nprovided by his employer. Their complaint, filed in a West Virginia\nState court, alleged medical malpractice, negligent supervision, negli-\ngent monitoring, negligent healthcare management, and vicarious lia-\nbility, all under the State law of West Virginia.\n\n   Cleavenger’s healthcare insurer removed the case to federal court\nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441 and 1331, asserting that the claims against\nit and related defendants were \"completely preempted\" by § 502(a) of\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). The plain-\ntiffs moved to remand the case to State court on the ground that their\nclaims challenged mixed decisions of plan administration and patient\ntreatment and that, under Pegram v. Herdrich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118372\"><a href=\"/opinion/118372/pegram-v-herdrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000),\nsuch claims are not preempted by ERISA. The district court denied\nthe plaintiffs’ motion to remand because their claims against the\nhealthcare insurers challenged purely administrative decisions under\nthe plan and were thus completely preempted by ERISA. The district\ncourt then considered the merits of plaintiffs’ preempted claims,\nwhich it treated as ERISA claims, and entered summary judgment\nagainst the plaintiffs on those claims. Finally, the court remanded the\nremaining state-law claims to State court.\n\n  On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge (1) the district court’s order\ndenying their motion to remand and (2) the district court’s summary\n\f4                         MARKS v. WATTERS\njudgment on the ERISA claims. For the reasons that follow, we\naffirm.\n\n                                    I\n\n   Robert Cleavenger was employed by Mountaineer Retreading, Inc.\nin Clarksburg, West Virginia, and in connection with his employment,\nMountaineer Retreading provided Cleavenger employee benefits,\nincluding healthcare benefits through a preferred provider organiza-\ntion plan (a \"PPO plan\") insured by Health Assurance. For the premi-\nums paid, Health Assurance agreed to pay Mountaineer Retreading’s\nemployees for 100% of the costs of medical care provided to them by\nparticipating healthcare providers — those who agreed to offer\nhealthcare pursuant to a fee schedule — and 80% of the costs of care\nprovided by nonparticipating providers. Cleavenger’s PPO plan,\nwhich detailed the scope of coverage as well as its limitations, pro-\nvided coverage for mental illness, including coverage for 45 days in\nan inpatient mental health facility and outpatient psychiatric consulta-\ntions.\n\n   Health Assurance subcontracted with Managed Care Services\nMainstay of Central Pennsylvania, Inc. (\"Mainstay\") to manage the\nbehavioral healthcare component of its PPO plan. This subcontract\nrequired Mainstay to provide \"certain mental health and chemical\ndependency outpatient and inpatient professional and technical ser-\nvices and related provider contracting and credentialing, utilization\nmanagement and quality improvement services.\" These services that\nMainstay undertook to provide included determinations of employee\neligibility, the medical necessity of services, the resolution of griev-\nances, and claims payment. Mainstay provided these services to\nemployees through case managers whom they designated in connec-\ntion with each claim. In this case, Mainstay designated Shelley Watt-\ners as the case manager to perform utilization review services in\nconnection with Cleavenger’s treatment.\n\n   In October 1998, while covered by his employee benefit plan,\nCleavenger was hospitalized at the William R. Sharpe, Jr. Hospital\n(\"Sharpe Hospital\") in Weston, West Virginia, after he attempted sui-\ncide by ingesting three bottles of pills and slitting his wrist. His sui-\ncide attempt came shortly after he assaulted his wife upon learning\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                           5\nthat she was having an affair with another man. He wrote a suicide\nnote describing his inability to bear the pain of his wife’s rejection.\nCleavenger was rushed to the emergency room, treated, and involun-\ntarily committed to Sharpe Hospital for monitoring and treatment.\n\n   At Sharpe Hospital, Cleavenger received four days of inpatient\ntreatment for depression. After he was admitted, Mary Ann Iquinto,\na Sharpe Hospital nurse, called Cleavenger’s insurer to determine\nCleavenger’s insurance coverage, as she routinely did for newly\nadmitted patients. Health Assurance referred Iquinto to Mainstay and\nto Shelley Watters. After learning of Cleavenger’s suicide attempt and\nself-injurious behavior, Watters authorized payment to Sharpe Hospi-\ntal for Cleavenger’s inpatient services. She also told Iquinto that\nbecause Sharpe Hospital was not a participating provider under Clea-\nvenger’s insurance policy, Cleavenger would be responsible for a\n20% co-pay.\n\n   The next day, October 7, 1998, Watters called Iquinto to inquire\nabout Cleavenger’s condition and was advised that Cleavenger\nremained on a suicide watch and that Sharpe Hospital planned to con-\ntinue to monitor him closely to see if he would stabilize and to\nincrease his social interaction. During the conversation, Watters\nauthorized payment for Cleavenger’s continued inpatient care.\n\n   Dr. Ahmed Aboraya, Cleavenger’s treating physician at Sharpe\nHospital, observed that over the next two days Cleavenger was doing\n\"fairly well,\" and he stopped the 15-minute checks made as part of the\nsuicide watch. He also noted Cleavenger was neither delusional nor\npsychotic and that he no longer posed a risk of harm to himself or oth-\ners.\n\n   After the first couple of days in the hospital, Cleavenger began to\nexpress concern to Dr. Aboraya that if he stayed in the hospital too\nlong he would lose his job. Dr. Aboraya noted that it was Clea-\nvenger’s \"will and his request that he want[ed] to go home and con-\ntinue to his job and continue the therapy as an outpatient.\" Based on\nCleavenger’s improved condition, Dr. Aboraya did not believe that\nthe hospital could keep Cleavenger against his will. Dr. Aboraya met\nwith a team of nurses and a social worker, explained that Cleavenger\nrequested discharge, and asked whether there were any concerns\n\f6                         MARKS v. WATTERS\nabout releasing him. Everybody on the team agreed that, under West\nVirginia law, there was no basis for holding Cleavenger against his\nwill, and so Dr. Aboraya noted on Cleavenger’s chart, \"Discharge the\npatient on Friday [October 9, 1998].\" Dr. Pollard, a Sharpe Hospital\ndoctor who observed Cleavenger and who had the authority to over-\nride Dr. Aboraya’s discharge decision, agreed with Dr. Aboraya’s\ndecision.\n\n   Cleavenger was released on Friday, October 9, 1998, from Sharpe\nHospital. Florence Hatton, the social worker on the unit at that time,\nwrote up a psychological assessment of Cleavenger and a plan for his\noutpatient care. Dr. Aboraya had only specified that Cleavenger\nneeded a psychologist who specialized in marital problems, and he\ndid not specify where Cleavenger should go for outpatient care. He\nleft that decision to Florence Hatton. Although both Valley Commu-\nnity Mental Health Center, Inc. (\"Valley Center\") and University\nHealth Associates at Chestnut Ridge Hospital (\"University Asso-\nciates\") were options for outpatient care — and both were, in Dr.\nAboraya’s estimation, \"similar clinics\" — Hatton noted that Clea-\nvenger \"stated he did not want to go to Valley [Center],\" even though\nit was the facility closer to Cleavenger’s residence. Hatton thus con-\ntacted University Associates and set up an appointment for Clea-\nvenger for October 12, 1998.\n\n   Watters, who had learned that Cleavenger was being released, sent\nCleavenger a letter, introducing herself as his case manager and indi-\ncating that she would continue to follow his treatment after discharge\nand contact him by telephone to assess his post-hospitalization status.\nShe also learned that Sharpe Hospital had set up an appointment for\nCleavenger at University Associates for October 12. After October\n12, Watters called Cleavenger to determine whether he had kept his\nappointment at University Associates, but Cleavenger never returned\nher call. Watters’ October 15 notes indicate that University Associates\ntold her that Cleavenger kept his first appointment, although Univer-\nsity Associates doubts that they would have communicated that infor-\nmation, as Cleavenger never showed up. Watters continued to attempt\nto reach Cleavenger but to no avail. Having not heard from him and\nassuming that Cleavenger was keeping his appointments, Watters\nclosed her file on Cleavenger.\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                             7\n   In fact, on the day of his release from the hospital, Cleavenger con-\ntacted University Associates to change his outpatient appointment that\nwas scheduled for October 12 because it conflicted with his return to\nwork. Cleavenger also postponed his next appointment on October 16\nin order to take his son to the dentist. One day later, on October 17,\n1998, Cleavenger killed his wife and daughter with a knife, injured\nhis son, and committed suicide by jumping head first from a second-\nstory window of the family’s home.\n\n   The plaintiffs, who are representatives of the estates of Cleavenger,\nhis wife, and his daughter, as well as the guardian of his surviving\nson, commenced this action for damages in State court, asserting vari-\nous state-law claims of negligence and vicarious liability against doc-\ntors, healthcare organizations, and insurance-related entities based on\nthe decision to release Cleavenger from the hospital to outpatient\ncare. In their complaint against Watters, the plaintiffs alleged that she\nwas negligent in\n\n    a) failing to adequately monitor Robert Cleavenger during\n    his out-patient treatment; b) failing to obtain or otherwise\n    cause the readmission of Robert Cleavenger to the Sharpe\n    Hospital or other inpatient facility once it became apparent\n    that Robert Cleavenger was non-compliant with out-patient\n    treatment services designed to monitor his recovery from his\n    mental illness; and c) failing to provide adequate warnings\n    to Robert Cleavenger’s family members, who were foresee-\n    able victims of Robert Cleavenger’s mental illness, as to\n    signs and symptoms of Robert Cleavenger’s remission.\n\nTheir complaint against Mainstay alleged only that Mainstay was\nvicariously liable for Watters’ negligence. Plaintiffs sought damages\nfor funeral and medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost earn-\nings, among other things.\n\n   After Health Assurance, with the consent of the other defendants,\nremoved this case to federal court on the ground that the claims\nagainst it as well as Mainstay and Watters were preempted by ERISA,\nplaintiffs filed a motion to remand this case to State court, arguing\nthat Mainstay and Watters had an active role in \"the decision as to the\ntype and quality of health care Robert Cleavenger received in October\n\f8                         MARKS v. WATTERS\nof 1998\" and that such mixed decisions involving both eligibility for\ncoverage and treatment were not subject to preemption under ERISA,\nbut rather were subject to state-law malpractice jurisprudence. The\ndistrict court rejected that argument and denied plaintiffs’ motion to\nremand, concluding that because plaintiffs’ case against Mainstay and\nWatters \"related to the administration of plan benefits, and not to the\nprovision of medical care,\" it had to be brought under ERISA, if at\nall. The court concluded:\n\n    [P]laintiffs cannot escape the facts that Mainstay never pur-\n    ported to provide Cleavenger with medical services, that\n    Cleavenger’s treating physicians were fully insulated from\n    the utilization review procedures performed by Mainstay,\n    and that Watters never spoke directly with Cleavenger’s\n    physicians and had no input into Cleavenger’s referral to\n    outpatient care. Cleavenger was discharged and referred to\n    outpatient therapy not because of a Mainstay policy that\n    determined level of care, but because his treating physicians\n    concluded that was the most appropriate level of treatment.\n    It was the treating physicians at Sharpe who were the\n    arrangers of Cleavenger’s care, not Mainstay or Shelley\n    Watters. Mainstay was performing a purely administrative\n    role.\n\n                                ***\n\n      At bottom, plaintiffs’ claims against Shelley Watters and\n    Mainstay attack the administration of Cleavenger’s benefits.\n    Plaintiffs essentially complain that the administration of the\n    PPO Plan led to Cleavenger’s being referred to outpatient\n    care. These claims go to plan administration, not provision\n    of medical services.\n\nThe district court also concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish a\nclaim under ERISA and entered summary judgment against them.\n\n  From the district court’s orders denying remand and granting sum-\nmary judgment to Mainstay and Watters, the plaintiffs filed this\nappeal.\n\f                          MARKS v.

They contend that\nERISA does not preempt their claims against Mainstay and Watters\nbecause these claims challenge \"mixed eligibility and treatment\" deci-\nsions — i.e., decisions in which plan administration and medical\njudgment are inextricably intertwined.

This \"broad\" and \"ex-\n\f10                        MARKS v. WATTERS\npansive\" preemption clause, Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 47, thus provides\na federal law defense to all common-law causes of action that \"relate\nto\" an employee benefit plan, unless ERISA expressly excepts the\ncause of action from ERISA’s preemption provision, id. at 48.\n\n   Having preempted a field defined by claims relating to an ERISA\nplan, ERISA precludes the prosecution of preempted state-law claims\nthat are not otherwise saved from preemption under § 514(b)(2)(A)\nunless they fall within the scope of the exclusive civil enforcement\nmechanism provided by § 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), in\nwhich case they must be treated as federal causes of action under\n§ 502(a). Section 502(a) authorizes participants or beneficiaries to file\ncivil actions to, among other things, recover benefits, enforce rights\nconferred by an ERISA plan, remedy breaches of fiduciary duty, clar-\nify rights to benefits, and enjoin violations of ERISA. Thus, if a state-\nlaw claim preempted by § 514 is not included within the scope of\n§ 502(a), the claim is susceptible to a § 514 defense, whether it is\nbrought in State or federal court. But if a state-law claim falls within\nthe scope of § 502(a), it is \"completely preempted\" and therefore\ntreated as a federal cause of action. See Metropolitan Life Ins.

One corollary of the well-pleaded\n    complaint rule developed in the case law, however, is that\n    Congress may so completely pre-empt a particular area that\n    any civil complaint raising this select group of claims\n    [within the scope of § 502(a)] is necessarily federal in char-\n    acter.\n\n481 U.S. at 63-64.\n\n   Accordingly, the question presented in this case is whether the\nplaintiffs’ claims against Mainstay and Watters fell within the scope\nof § 502(a). If they did, then their claims were properly treated as fed-\neral causes of action and their removal to federal court was appropri-\nate. On the other hand, if they did not fall within the scope of\n§ 502(a), then their remand to State court would be required, even\nthough § 514 might provide a defense to them in State court.\n\n   We now turn to plaintiffs’ claims and begin by noting that plain-\ntiffs have conceded that they are beneficiaries or participants under an\nemployee benefit plan provided by Mountaineer Retreading, Inc. to\nRobert Cleavenger, one of its employees. They also concede that\nthere is no dispute that the inpatient and outpatient care that is\ninvolved in this action was \"covered under Mr. Cleavenger’s health\ncare plan\" provided by Mountaineer Retreading and that the plan was\nregulated by ERISA. Finally, they recognize that Cleavenger’s bene-\nfits for mental illness were managed by Mainstay pursuant to a con-\ntractual arrangement between it and the plan.\n\f12                        MARKS v. WATTERS\n   Plaintiffs’ argument focuses on the contention that their claims\nagainst Mainstay and Watters arise out of \"mixed eligibility and treat-\nment decisions\" made by Mainstay and Watters. They argue that such\nmixed eligibility and treatment decisions are governed by State law\nunder the holding of Pegram v. Herdrich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118372\"><a href=\"/opinion/118372/pegram-v-herdrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), which\nessentially held that duties exercised in such mixed decisions arise\nfrom State common-law malpractice jurisprudence, which Congress\ndid not preempt under § 514 of ERISA.\n\n   In Pegram, the Supreme Court considered an HMO’s simultaneous\nduties as both an ERISA plan administrator and a healthcare provider,\nrecognizing that in acting as a plan administrator, an HMO functions\nas a plan fiduciary regulated by ERISA and that in providing treat-\nment of a patient’s medical conditions, the HMO functions as a\nhealthcare provider regulated by State malpractice jurisprudence.\nAnalyzing this \"dual medical/administrative role[ ] of HMOs,\" the\nSupreme Court concluded that an HMO’s activities can be placed into\nthree categories: (1) pure administrative eligibility decisions, (2)\nmixed eligibility and treatment decisions, and (3) pure treatment deci-\nsions. Pegram, 530 U.S. at 228-29. Pure eligibility decisions relate to\n\"the plan’s coverage of a particular condition or medical procedure\nfor its treatment.\" Id. at 228. \"‘Treatment decisions,’ by contrast, are\nchoices about how to go about diagnosing and treating a patient’s\ncondition: given a patient’s constellation of symptoms, what is the\nappropriate medical response?\" Id. Mixed eligibility and treatment\ndecisions exist when those two decisions are \"practically inextricable\nfrom one another\" such that \"eligibility decisions cannot be untangled\nfrom physicians’ judgments about reasonable medical treatment.\" Id.\nat 228-29. The Court noted that while an HMO acts as an ERISA\nfiduciary when making pure eligibility decisions, it does not act as an\nERISA fiduciary when making pure treatment decisions. Addressing\nthe third category, the Court held that Congress did not intend for any\nHMO \"to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed\neligibility decisions acting through its physicians.\" Id. at 231. The\nCourt explained that \"for all practical purposes, every claim of fidu-\nciary breach by an HMO physician making a mixed decision would\nboil down to a malpractice claim, and the fiduciary standard would\nbe nothing but the malpractice standard traditionally applied in\nactions against physicians.\" Id. at 235. The Court thus concluded that\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                              13\n\"mixed eligibility decisions by HMO physicians are not fiduciary\ndecisions under ERISA.\" Id. at 237.\n\n   Under the teaching of Pegram, when an HMO diagnoses and treats\na patient’s condition with an appropriate medical response, even if it\nis at the same time also making an eligibility determination, it does\nnot act as a fiduciary under ERISA because the mixed eligibility and\ntreatment decisions as a practical matter reduce to the stuff of State\nmalpractice claims and not to traditional breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims. But when an HMO acts as a fiduciary in relation to an ERISA\nplan, performing the functions of a fiduciary as defined in ERISA,\nthen a claim against it for breach of that fiduciary duty must be\nbrought exclusively under ERISA.\n\n   A person undertaking to act as a fiduciary under ERISA is required\nto \"discharge his duties with respect to [an ERISA] plan solely in the\ninterest of participants and beneficiaries,\" for the exclusive purpose\nof \"(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and\n(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" 29\nU.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A). A person functions as a fiduciary only\n\n    to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or\n    discretionary control respecting management of [a] plan or\n    exercises any authority or control respecting management or\n    disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for\n    a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect\n    to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any\n    authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discre-\n    tionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the\n    administration of such plan.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A). Thus, to the extent that a civil complaint\nchallenges the conduct of a fiduciary, as defined in ERISA and\nexplained by Pegram, the complaint must be brought under § 502(a)\nof ERISA, or not at all.\n\n   In this case, Mainstay was a contractor hired by Health Assurance\nto manage, as a utilization review agent, the behavioral healthcare\ncomponent of its PPO health plan issued to Mountaineer Retreading.\nHealth Assurance was not an HMO but a preferred provider organiza-\n\f14                       MARKS v. WATTERS\ntion or PPO that provided reimbursement for healthcare coverage sup-\nplied by third parties. Under the plan, Cleavenger, as a covered\nemployee, was free to choose his own healthcare providers. If he\nchose a participating provider — one who had a contractual arrange-\nment with Health Assurance or Mainstay to provide healthcare to\ninsureds at an agreed-upon fee schedule — then Health Assurance\nwould pay 100% of the cost of services rendered to Cleavenger. If,\non the other hand, Cleavenger chose to go outside the network estab-\nlished by Health Assurance, Health Assurance agreed to pay 80% of\nthe usual and customary charges and Cleavenger would become\nresponsible for the remaining 20%.\n\n   Under its contract with Health Assurance, Mainstay did not treat\npatients. Rather, it managed Cleavenger’s utilization of healthcare\nprovided by others to accommodate the benefits of the plan. Thus, it\nagreed to perform network development, credentialing of healthcare\nproviders, utilization review, and quality assurance functions in the\narea of behavioral healthcare. And under its utilization review pro-\ncess, Mainstay supplied case managers, such as Shelley Watters, to\nconfirm with healthcare providers that the healthcare being delivered\nor proposed was approved for payment under the patient’s healthcare\nplan. The case managers, however, had no authority to decline\napproval for payment. If a case manager was unable to confirm cover-\nage upon reviewing the specifics of the patient’s healthcare plan and\nthe applicable medical necessity criteria, the case manager was\nrequired to refer the matter to Mainstay’s medical director. Most\nimportantly to this case, Shelley Watters was never engaged to actu-\nally provide treatment or to make treatment decisions for Cleavenger.\nAnd for this reason, the district court concluded that, based on the\nrecord before it, \"Mainstay never purported to provide Cleavenger\nwith medical services, that Cleavenger’s treating physicians were\nfully insulated from the utilization review procedures performed by\nMainstay, and that Watters never spoke directly with Cleavenger’s\nphysicians and had no input into Cleavenger’s referral to outpatient\ncare.\"\n\n   Cleavenger’s estate and representatives of his family as beneficia-\nries filed their claims against Watters for negligence in the perfor-\nmance of services as a case manager for Mainstay. Although the\ncomplaint also attributes to Watters negligent medical treatment deci-\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                           15\nsions, the record indisputably establishes that Watters was never\nengaged as a provider of medical treatment and that she never made\na treatment decision. Indeed, there is no evidence that she even talked\nwith the doctors who did treat Cleavenger. Stated otherwise, there\nwas no evidence that eligibility decisions made by Watters as an inde-\npendent utilization review agent for Health Assurance were \"practi-\ncally inextricable\" from the treatment decisions made by\nCleavenger’s physicians such that one could conclude that Watters’\ndecisions amounted to mixed eligibility and treatment decisions.\nIndeed, the record demonstrates that the physician treating Clea-\nvenger neither spoke to Watters nor had even heard of Mainstay.\nThus, as the Supreme Court noted in Pegram, even though the dis-\ntinction between pure eligibility decisions and treatment decisions\nmay tend to blur when the treating physician is also responsible for\nmaking eligibility decisions, as is the case in a traditional HMO, that\nis not the case here where the treating physicians and Watters were\ninstitutionally segregated from one another. Watters worked for an\nindependent utilization review agent that was under contract with\nHealth Assurance, a PPO, and the treating physicians were simply\nemployed by, or connected with, the hospital to which Cleavenger\nwas admitted. Under this arrangement, treatment decisions and eligi-\nbility decisions were made by different people at different times\naccording to different policies. Indeed, in this case Mary Ann Iquinto\nof Sharpe Hospital apprised Watters of medical treatment decisions\nand diagnoses only after the doctors had already made them.\n\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that Watters or Mainstay had covert or\nundisclosed communications with any of Cleavenger’s healthcare\nproviders. Rather, they argue that Watters’ administration of the plan\nhad the effect of causing the healthcare providers to discharge Clea-\nvenger prematurely. They also allege maladministration of the plan to\nthe extent that Cleavenger’s referral to the outpatient facility at Uni-\nversity Associates amounted to a violation of Mainstay’s \"geographic\naccessibility standards,\" which elaborate a preference for referring\npatients to the nearest outpatient facilities. They additionally allege\nthat Watters’ conduct was deficient because she did not properly fol-\nlow up on Cleavenger’s outpatient progress as required by the plan.\nAll of these claims, however, attack only Watters’ administration of\nthe plan.\n\f16                        MARKS v. WATTERS\n    Claims challenging the administration of an employee welfare ben-\nefit plan fall squarely within the scope of § 502(a) of ERISA. Such\nclaims include allegations that a plan benefit was denied based on\nnoncompliance with the terms of a plan or allegations that an ERISA\nfiduciary breached a duty to a plaintiff by improperly denying a bene-\nfit based solely on financial motivations. The core allegation underly-\ning a § 502(a) claim is that a plan participant or beneficiary was\ndenied a benefit to which the participant or beneficiary was entitled\nunder an ERISA plan or that the manner of administering the benefits\ncaused the participants or beneficiaries some injury. These are pre-\ncisely the types of claims that plaintiffs are making against Watters\nand, vicariously, against Mainstay. Plaintiffs cannot transform what\nis properly considered a § 502(a) claim into a state-law claim for mal-\npractice simply by making unsubstantiated and incorrect statements\nthat an independent utilization review agent was responsible for medi-\ncal decisions.\n\n   In sum, we conclude that plaintiffs’ claims are claims for malad-\nministration against Mainstay and Watters that fall within the scope\nof § 502(a) of ERISA and therefore were properly treated as federal\nclaims and removed to federal court. Accordingly, we affirm the dis-\ntrict court’s order based on the doctrine of complete preemption,\ndenying the plaintiffs’ motion to remand this case to State court.\n\n                                  III\n\n   Taking plaintiffs’ claims as claims for breach of fiduciary duty\nunder § 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), we must still deter-\nmine whether the district court erred in entering summary judgment\nin favor of Watters and Mainstay for an alleged violation of ERISA.\nWe conclude that the district court did not err.\n\n   Plaintiffs have offered nothing more than innuendo to support a\nclaim of wrongdoing by Watters and Mainstay. They argue, for exam-\nple, that through Watters’ administration of the plan, Mainstay chan-\nneled Cleavenger to University Associates rather than the more local\nfacility, Valley Center: \"It is clear that the reason why Mainstay pro-\ncured Robert Cleavenger’s referral to a lower level of care at [Univer-\nsity Associates] was motivated by financial considerations . . . . Dr.\nWallendjack specifically testified that referring members to a partici-\n\f                          MARKS v. WATTERS                          17\npating provider inures to the benefit of the PPO.\" To support this\nargument, plaintiffs pulled selected references from the record, such\nas a handwritten note with the words \"non-par[ticipating]\" next to\nValley Center, to suggest that Valley Center was not a participating\nprovider in the Health Assurance network, while University Asso-\nciates was. Plaintiffs’ assertion, however, is disingenuous, because in\nfact, both University Associates and Valley Center were participating\nproviders in October 1998. When faced with this fact at oral argu-\nment, plaintiffs’ counsel revised their position, arguing that Watters\nand Mainstay channeled Cleavenger away from Valley Center\nbecause, although it was a participating provider, Watters and Main-\nstay thought it was not. This argument, too, is supported by nothing\nmore than innuendo.\n\n   The uncontroverted facts support both that Cleavenger insisted on\nleaving Sharpe Hospital to return to work and that he expressed a\npreference for the further-away outpatient facility. Cleavenger was\nonly released from Sharpe Hospital after a team of doctors, nurses,\nand a social worker determined that he could not legally be kept\nagainst his will based on his medical condition at the time. The thrust\nof plaintiffs’ complaint is directed at this medical decision made by\nother defendants and not against the administration provided by Watt-\ners and Mainstay. Whether plaintiffs can establish a breach of duty\ngiving rise to malpractice against defendants other than Mainstay and\nWatters for releasing Cleavenger and sending him to University Asso-\nciates is a question on which we express no opinion because that\nforms the core of plaintiffs’ State malpractice claims against the\nhealthcare providers. We only conclude that, on the record before us,\nthe facts do not support a claim that Mainstay and Watters breached\nany fiduciary duty in violation of ERISA.\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s order granting sum-\nmary judgment to Watters and Mainstay is affirmed.\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED\n\f</pre>",
