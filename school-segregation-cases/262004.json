GALLOWAY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12–696.      Argued November 6, 2013—Decided May 5, 2014\nSince 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York,\n  have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance,\n  and a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in\n  a local directory. While the prayer program is open to all creeds,\n  nearly all of the local congregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of\n  the participating prayer givers have been too. Respondents, citizens\n  who attend meetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that\n  the town violated the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by\n  preferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sec-\n  tarian prayers. They sought to limit the town to “inclusive and ecu-\n  menical” prayers that referred only to a “generic God.” The District\n  Court upheld the prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no\n  impermissible preference for Christianity; concluding that the Chris-\n  tian identity of most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly\n  Christian character of the town’s congregations, not an official policy\n  or practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that the\n  First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from con-\n  gregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity; and re-\n  jecting the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian. The\n  Second Circuit reversed, holding that some aspects of the prayer pro-\n  gram, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the\n  message that Greece was endorsing Christianity.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n681 F. 3d 20, reversed.\n    JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part II–B, concluding that the town’s prayer practice does not violate\n  the Establishment Clause. Pp. 6–18.\n\f2                  TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been un-\n    derstood as compatible with the Establishment Clause. Marsh v.\n    Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, 792. In Marsh, the Court concluded that it\n    was not necessary to define the Establishment Clause’s precise\n    boundary in order to uphold Nebraska’s practice of employing a legis-\n    lative chaplain because history supported the conclusion that the\n    specific practice was permitted. The First Congress voted to appoint\n    and pay official chaplains shortly after approving language for the\n    First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained the office virtu-\n    ally uninterrupted since then. See id., at 787–789, and n. 10. A ma-\n    jority of the States have also had a consistent practice of legislative\n    prayer. Id., at 788–790, and n. 11. There is historical precedent for\n    the practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as well.\n    Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted\n    “by reference to historical practices and understandings.” County of\n    Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh\n    Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 670 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Thus, any test\n    must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and\n    has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change. The\n    Court’s inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer prac-\n    tice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in\n    Congress and the state legislatures. Pp. 6–9.\n       (b) Respondents’ insistence on nonsectarian prayer is not con-\n    sistent with this tradition. The prayers in Marsh were consistent\n    with the First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic\n    theism but because the Nation’s history and tradition have shown\n    that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t] with the principles\n    of disestablishment and religious freedom.” 463 U. S., at 786. Dic-\n    tum in County of Allegheny suggesting that Marsh permitted only\n    prayer with no overtly Christian references is irreconcilable with the\n    facts, holding, and reasoning of Marsh, which instructed that the\n    “content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided “there is\n    no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to prose-\n    lytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.”\n    463 U. S., at 794–795. To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian\n    would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts decid-\n    ing these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,\n    thus involving government in religious matters to a far greater de-\n    gree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither ed-\n    iting nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content\n    after the fact. Respondents’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive.\n    It is doubtful that consensus could be reached as to what qualifies as\n    a generic or nonsectarian prayer. It would also be unwise to conclude\n    that only those religious words acceptable to the majority are permis-\n\f                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsible, for the First Amendment is not a majority rule and government\nmay not seek to define permissible categories of religious speech. In\nrejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian,\nthe Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content.\nThe relevant constraint derives from the prayer’s place at the open-\ning of legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the oc-\ncasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. From the\nNation’s earliest days, invocations have been addressed to assemblies\ncomprising many different creeds, striving for the idea that people of\nmany faiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion,\neven if they disagree as to religious doctrine. The prayers delivered\nin Greece do not fall outside this tradition. They may have invoked,\ne.g., the name of Jesus, but they also invoked universal themes, e.g.,\nby calling for a “spirit of cooperation.” Absent a pattern of prayers\nthat over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible gov-\nernment purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a par-\nticular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation. See\n463 U. S., at 794–795. Finally, so long as the town maintains a policy\nof nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search\nbeyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to\nachieve religious balancing. Pp. 9–18.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,\nconcluded in Part II–B that a fact-sensitive inquiry that considers\nboth the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom\nit is directed shows that the town is not coercing its citizens to engage\nin a religious observance. The prayer opportunity is evaluated\nagainst the backdrop of a historical practice showing that prayer has\nbecome part of the Nation’s heritage and tradition. It is presumed\nthat the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and\nunderstands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceed-\nings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many\nprivate citizens. Furthermore, the principal audience for these invo-\ncations is not the public, but the lawmakers themselves. And those\nlawmakers did not direct the public to participate, single out dissi-\ndents for opprobrium, or indicate that their decisions might be influ-\nenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity. Re-\nspondents claim that the prayers gave them offense and made them\nfeel excluded and disrespected, but offense does not equate to coer-\ncion. In contrast to Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, where the Court\nfound coercive a religious invocation at a high school graduation, id.,\nat 592–594, the record here does not suggest that citizens are dis-\nsuaded from leaving the meeting room during the prayer, arriving\nlate, or making a later protest. That the prayer in Greece is deliv-\nered during the opening ceremonial portion of the town’s meeting, not\n\f4                  TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the policymaking portion, also suggests that its purpose and effect\n    are to acknowledge religious leaders and their institutions, not to ex-\n    clude or coerce nonbelievers. Pp. 18–23.\n      JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA as to Part II, agreed\n    that the town’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment\n    Clause, but concluded that, even if the Establishment Clause were\n    properly incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth\n    Amendment, the Clause is not violated by the kind of subtle pres-\n    sures respondents allegedly suffered, which do not amount to actual\n    legal coercion. The municipal prayers in this case bear no resem-\n    blance to the coercive state establishments that existed at the found-\n    ing, which exercised government power in order to exact financial\n    support of the church, compel religious observance, or control reli-\n    gious doctrine.

It\nmust be concluded, consistent with the Court’s opinion in\nMarsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), that no violation\nof the Constitution has been shown.\n                             I\n  Greece, a town with a population of 94,000, is in upstate\nNew York. For some years, it began its monthly town\nboard meetings with a moment of silence. In 1999, the\nnewly elected town supervisor, John Auberger, decided to\nreplicate the prayer practice he had found meaningful\nwhile serving in the county legislature. Following the roll\ncall and recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, Auberger\nwould invite a local clergyman to the front of the room to\ndeliver an invocation. After the prayer, Auberger would\n——————\n  * THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO join this opinion in full.\nJUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE THOMAS join this opinion except as to Part\nII–B.\n\f2             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthank the minister for serving as the board’s “chaplain for\nthe month” and present him with a commemorative\nplaque. The prayer was intended to place town board\nmembers in a solemn and deliberative frame of mind,\ninvoke divine guidance in town affairs, and follow a tradi­\ntion practiced by Congress and dozens of state legisla­\ntures. App. 22a–25a.\n   The town followed an informal method for selecting\nprayer givers, all of whom were unpaid volunteers. A\ntown employee would call the congregations listed in a\nlocal directory until she found a minister available for that\nmonth’s meeting. The town eventually compiled a list of\nwilling “board chaplains” who had accepted invitations\nand agreed to return in the future. The town at no point\nexcluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer\ngiver. Its leaders maintained that a minister or layperson\nof any persuasion, including an atheist, could give the\ninvocation. But nearly all of the congregations in town\nwere Christian; and from 1999 to 2007, all of the partici­\npating ministers were too.\n   Greece neither reviewed the prayers in advance of the\nmeetings nor provided guidance as to their tone or con­\ntent, in the belief that exercising any degree of control\nover the prayers would infringe both the free exercise and\nspeech rights of the ministers. Id., at 22a. The town\ninstead left the guest clergy free to compose their own\ndevotions. The resulting prayers often sounded both civic\nand religious themes. Typical were invocations that asked\nthe divinity to abide at the meeting and bestow blessings\non the community:\n    “Lord we ask you to send your spirit of servanthood\n    upon all of us gathered here this evening to do your\n    work for the benefit of all in our community. We ask\n    you to bless our elected and appointed officials so they\n    may deliberate with wisdom and act with courage.\n    Bless the members of our community who come here\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

Lord we ask you\n    to bless us all, that everything we do here tonight will\n    move you to welcome us one day into your kingdom as\n    good and faithful servants. We ask this in the name\n    of our brother Jesus. Amen.” Id., at 45a.\nSome of the ministers spoke in a distinctly Christian\nidiom; and a minority invoked religious holidays, scrip­\nture, or doctrine, as in the following prayer:\n    “Lord, God of all creation, we give you thanks and\n    praise for your presence and action in the world. We\n    look with anticipation to the celebration of Holy Week\n    and Easter. It is in the solemn events of next week\n    that we find the very heart and center of our Chris­\n    tian faith. We acknowledge the saving sacrifice of\n    Jesus Christ on the cross. We draw strength, vitality,\n    and confidence from his resurrection at Easter. . . .\n    We pray for peace in the world, an end to terrorism,\n    violence, conflict, and war.

Praise and glory be yours,\n    O Lord, now and forever more. Amen.” Id., at 88a–\n    89a.\n   Respondents Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens\nattended town board meetings to speak about issues of\nlocal concern, and they objected that the prayers violated\ntheir religious or philosophical views. At one meeting,\nGalloway admonished board members that she found\nthe prayers “offensive,” “intolerable,” and an affront to a\n“diverse community.”      Complaint in No. 08–cv–6088\n(WDNY), ¶66. After respondents complained that Chris­\ntian themes pervaded the prayers, to the exclusion of\ncitizens who did not share those beliefs, the town invited a\nJewish layman and the chairman of the local Baha’i tem­\nple to deliver prayers. A Wiccan priestess who had read\n\f4             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npress reports about the prayer controversy requested, and\nwas granted, an opportunity to give the invocation.\n   Galloway and Stephens brought suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of New\nYork. They alleged that the town violated the First\nAmendment’s Establishment Clause by preferring Chris­\ntians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian\nprayers, such as those given “in Jesus’ name.” 732\nF. Supp. 2d 195, 203 (2010). They did not seek an end to\nthe prayer practice, but rather requested an injunction\nthat would limit the town to “inclusive and ecumenical”\nprayers that referred only to a “generic God” and would\nnot associate the government with any one faith or belief.\nId., at 210, 241.\n   The District Court on summary judgment upheld the\nprayer practice as consistent with the First Amendment.\nIt found no impermissible preference for Christianity,\nnoting that the town had opened the prayer program to all\ncreeds and excluded none. Although most of the prayer\ngivers were Christian, this fact reflected only the predom­\ninantly Christian identity of the town’s congregations,\nrather than an official policy or practice of discriminating\nagainst minority faiths. The District Court found no\nauthority for the proposition that the First Amendment\nrequired Greece to invite clergy from congregations be­\nyond its borders in order to achieve a minimum level of\nreligious diversity.\n   The District Court also rejected the theory that legisla­\ntive prayer must be nonsectarian. The court began its\ninquiry with the opinion in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S.\n783, which permitted prayer in state legislatures by a\nchaplain paid from the public purse, so long as the prayer\nopportunity was not “exploited to proselytize or advance\nany one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief,” id., at\n794–795. With respect to the prayer in Greece, the Dis­\ntrict Court concluded that references to Jesus, and the\noccasional request that the audience stand for the prayer,\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not amount to impermissible proselytizing. It located\nin Marsh no additional requirement that the prayers be\npurged of sectarian content. In this regard the court\nquoted recent invocations offered in the U. S. House of\nRepresentatives “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,”\ne.g., 156 Cong Rec. H5205 (June 30, 2010), and situated\nprayer in this context as part a long tradition. Finally, the\ntrial court noted this Court’s statement in County of Alle-\ngheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pitts-\nburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 603 (1989), that the prayers\nin Marsh did not offend the Establishment Clause “be­\ncause the particular chaplain had ‘removed all references\nto Christ.’ ” But the District Court did not read that\nstatement to mandate that legislative prayer be nonsec­\ntarian, at least in circumstances where the town permitted\nclergy from a variety of faiths to give invocations. By\nwelcoming many viewpoints, the District Court concluded,\nthe town would be unlikely to give the impression that it\nwas affiliating itself with any one religion.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.\n681 F. 3d 20, 34 (2012). It held that some aspects of the\nprayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable\nobserver, conveyed the message that Greece was endors­\ning Christianity. The town’s failure to promote the prayer\nopportunity to the public, or to invite ministers from con­\ngregations outside the town limits, all but “ensured a\nChristian viewpoint.” Id., at 30–31. Although the court\nfound no inherent problem in the sectarian content of the\nprayers, it concluded that the “steady drumbeat” of Chris­\ntian prayer, unbroken by invocations from other faith\ntraditions, tended to affiliate the town with Christianity.\nId., at 32. Finally, the court found it relevant that guest\nclergy sometimes spoke on behalf of all present at the\nmeeting, as by saying “let us pray,” or by asking audience\nmembers to stand and bow their heads: “The invitation . . .\nto participate in the prayer . . . placed audience members\n\f6             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwho are nonreligious or adherents of non-Christian reli­\ngion in the awkward position of either participating in\nprayers invoking beliefs they did not share or appearing to\nshow disrespect for the invocation.” Ibid. That board\nmembers bowed their heads or made the sign of the cross\nfurther conveyed the message that the town endorsed\nChristianity. The Court of Appeals emphasized that it\nwas the “interaction of the facts present in this case,”\nrather than any single element, that rendered the prayer\nunconstitutional. Id., at 33.\n  Having granted certiorari to decide whether the town’s\nprayer practice violates the Establishment Clause, 569\nU. S. ___ (2013), the Court now reverses the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n                              II\n   In Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, the Court found\nno First Amendment violation in the Nebraska Legisla­\nture’s practice of opening its sessions with a prayer deliv­\nered by a chaplain paid from state funds. The decision\nconcluded that legislative prayer, while religious in na­\nture, has long been understood as compatible with the\nEstablishment Clause. As practiced by Congress since the\nframing of the Constitution, legislative prayer lends grav-\nity to public business, reminds lawmakers to transcend\npetty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and ex­\npresses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful soci-\nety. See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 693 (1984)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring); cf. A. Adams & C. Emmerich, A\nNation Dedicated to Religious Liberty 83 (1990). The\nCourt has considered this symbolic expression to be a\n“tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held,” Marsh,\n463 U. S., at 792, rather than a first, treacherous step\ntowards establishment of a state church.\n   Marsh is sometimes described as “carving out an excep­\ntion” to the Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence,\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause it sustained legislative prayer without subjecting\nthe practice to “any of the formal ‘tests’ that have tradi­\ntionally structured” this inquiry. Id., at 796, 813 (Bren­\nnan, J., dissenting). The Court in Marsh found those tests\nunnecessary because history supported the conclusion that\nlegislative invocations are compatible with the Establish­\nment Clause. The First Congress made it an early item of\nbusiness to appoint and pay official chaplains, and both\nthe House and Senate have maintained the office virtually\nuninterrupted since that time. See id., at 787–789, and\nn. 10; N. Feldman, Divided by God 109 (2005).

When\nMarsh was decided, in 1983, legislative prayer had per­\nsisted in the Nebraska Legislature for more than a cen-\ntury, and the majority of the other States also had the\nsame, consistent practice. 463 U. S., at 788–790, and n. 11.\nAlthough no information has been cited by the parties to\nindicate how many local legislative bodies open their\nmeetings with prayer, this practice too has historical\nprecedent. See Reports of Proceedings of the City Council\nof Boston for the Year Commencing Jan. 1, 1909, and\nEnding Feb. 5, 1910, pp. 1–2 (1910) (Rev. Arthur Little)\n(“And now we desire to invoke Thy presence, Thy blessing,\nand Thy guidance upon those who are gathered here this\nmorning . . .”). “In light of the unambiguous and unbroken\nhistory of more than 200 years, there can be no doubt that\nthe practice of opening legislative sessions with a prayer\nhas become part of the fabric of our society.” Marsh,\nsupra, at 792.\n   Yet Marsh must not be understood as permitting a\npractice that would amount to a constitutional violation if\nnot for its historical foundation. The case teaches instead\nthat the Establishment Clause must be interpreted “by\n\f8             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreference to historical practices and understandings.”\nCounty of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 670 (KENNEDY, J., con­\ncurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). That\nthe First Congress provided for the appointment of chap­\nlains only days after approving language for the First\nAmendment demonstrates that the Framers considered\nlegislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion’s\nrole in society. D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress:\nThe Federalist Period 1789–1801, pp. 12–13 (1997). In the\n1850’s, the judiciary committees in both the House and\nSenate reevaluated the practice of official chaplaincies\nafter receiving petitions to abolish the office. The commit­\ntees concluded that the office posed no threat of an estab­\nlishment because lawmakers were not compelled to attend\nthe daily prayer, S. Rep. No. 376, 32d Cong., 2d Sess., 2\n(1853); no faith was excluded by law, nor any favored, id.,\nat 3; and the cost of the chaplain’s salary imposed a van­\nishingly small burden on taxpayers, H. Rep. No. 124, 33d\nCong., 1st Sess., 6 (1854). Marsh stands for the proposi­\ntion that it is not necessary to define the precise boundary\nof the Establishment Clause where history shows that the\nspecific practice is permitted. Any test the Court adopts\nmust acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the\nFramers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time\nand political change.

A test that would sweep away\nwhat has so long been settled would create new controversy\nand begin anew the very divisions along religious lines\nthat the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent.

Respondents assert that the town’s prayer exercise\nfalls outside that tradition and transgresses the Estab­\nlishment Clause for two independent but mutually rein­\nforcing reasons. First, they argue that Marsh did not\napprove prayers containing sectarian language or themes,\nsuch as the prayers offered in Greece that referred to the\n“death, resurrection, and ascension of the Savior Jesus\nChrist,” App. 129a, and the “saving sacrifice of Jesus\nChrist on the cross,” id., at 88a. Second, they argue that\nthe setting and conduct of the town board meetings create\nsocial pressures that force nonadherents to remain in the\nroom or even feign participation in order to avoid offend­\ning the representatives who sponsor the prayer and will\nvote on matters citizens bring before the board. The sec­\ntarian content of the prayers compounds the subtle coer­\ncive pressures, they argue, because the nonbeliever who\nmight tolerate ecumenical prayer is forced to do the same\nfor prayer that might be inimical to his or her beliefs.\n                              A\n   Respondents maintain that prayer must be nonsectarian,\nor not identifiable with any one religion; and they fault\nthe town for permitting guest chaplains to deliver prayers\nthat “use overtly Christian terms” or “invoke specifics of\nChristian theology.” Brief for Respondents 20. A prayer is\nfitting for the public sphere, in their view, only if it con­\ntains the ‘ “most general, nonsectarian reference to God,’ ”\nid., at 33 (quoting M. Meyerson, Endowed by Our Creator:\nThe Birth of Religious Freedom in America 11–12 (2012)),\nand eschews mention of doctrines associated with any one\nfaith, Brief for Respondents 32–33. They argue that prayer\nwhich contemplates “the workings of the Holy Spirit, the\nevents of Pentecost, and the belief that God ‘has raised\n\f10            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nup the Lord Jesus’ and ‘will raise us, in our turn, and put\nus by His side’ ” would be impermissible, as would any\nprayer that reflects dogma particular to a single faith\ntradition. Id., at 34 (quoting App. 89a and citing id., at\n56a, 123a, 134a).\n   An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a\nsingle, fixed standard is not consistent with the tradition\nof legislative prayer outlined in the Court’s cases. The\nCourt found the prayers in Marsh consistent with the\nFirst Amendment not because they espoused only a ge-\nneric theism but because our history and tradition have\nshown that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t]\nwith the principles of disestablishment and religious\nfreedom.” 463 U. S., at 786. The Congress that drafted\nthe First Amendment would have been accustomed to\ninvocations containing explicitly religious themes of the\nsort respondents find objectionable. One of the Senate’s\nfirst chaplains, the Rev. William White, gave prayers in a\nseries that included the Lord’s Prayer, the Collect for\nAsh Wednesday, prayers for peace and grace, a general\nthanksgiving, St. Chrysostom’s Prayer, and a prayer\nseeking “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, &c.” Letter\nfrom W. White to H. Jones (Dec. 29, 1830), in B. Wilson,\nMemoir of the Life of the Right Reverend William White,\nD. D., Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the\nState of Pennsylvania 322 (1839); see also New Hampshire\nPatriot & State Gazette, Dec. 15, 1823, p. 1 (describing a\nSenate prayer addressing the “Throne of Grace”); Cong.\nGlobe, 37th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1861) (reciting the Lord’s\nPrayer). The decidedly Christian nature of these prayers\nmust not be dismissed as the relic of a time when our\nNation was less pluralistic than it is today. Congress\ncontinues to permit its appointed and visiting chaplains to\nexpress themselves in a religious idiom. It acknowledges\nour growing diversity not by proscribing sectarian content\nbut by welcoming ministers of many creeds. See, e.g., 160\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

H5633 (Aug. 2, 2012)\n(Imam Nayyar Imam) (“The final prophet of God, Mu­\nhammad, peace be upon him, stated: ‘The leaders of a\npeople are a representation of their deeds’ ”).\n   The contention that legislative prayer must be generic\nor nonsectarian derives from dictum in County of Allegheny,\n492 U. S. 573, that was disputed when written and has\nbeen repudiated by later cases. There the Court held that\na crèche placed on the steps of a county courthouse to\ncelebrate the Christmas season violated the Establish­\nment Clause because it had “the effect of endorsing a\npatently Christian message.” Id., at 601. Four dissenting\nJustices disputed that endorsement could be the proper\ntest, as it likely would condemn a host of traditional prac­\ntices that recognize the role religion plays in our society,\namong them legislative prayer and the “forthrightly reli­\ngious” Thanksgiving proclamations issued by nearly every\nPresident since Washington. Id., at 670–671. The Court\nsought to counter this criticism by recasting Marsh to\npermit only prayer that contained no overtly Christian\nreferences:\n    “However history may affect the constitutionality of\n    nonsectarian references to religion by the government,\n    history cannot legitimate practices that demonstrate\n    the government’s allegiance to a particular sect or\n    creed . . . . The legislative prayers involved in Marsh\n    did not violate this principle because the particular\n\f12             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     chaplain had ‘removed all references to Christ.’ ” Id.,\n     at 603 (quoting Marsh, supra, at 793, n. 14; footnote\n     omitted).\n  This proposition is irreconcilable with the facts of Marsh\nand with its holding and reasoning. Marsh nowhere sug­\ngested that the constitutionality of legislative prayer turns\non the neutrality of its content. The opinion noted that\nNebraska’s chaplain, the Rev. Robert E. Palmer, modu-\nlated the “explicitly Christian” nature of his prayer and\n“removed all references to Christ” after a Jewish law­\nmaker complained. 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14. With this foot­\nnote, the Court did no more than observe the practical\ndemands placed on a minister who holds a permanent,\nappointed position in a legislature and chooses to write his\nor her prayers to appeal to more members, or at least to\ngive less offense to those who object. See Mallory, “An\nOfficer of the House Which Chooses Him, and Nothing\nMore”: How Should Marsh v. Chambers Apply to Rotating\nChaplains?, 73 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1421, 1445 (2006). Marsh\ndid not suggest that Nebraska’s prayer practice would\nhave failed had the chaplain not acceded to the legislator’s\nrequest. Nor did the Court imply the rule that prayer\nviolates the Establishment Clause any time it is given in\nthe name of a figure deified by only one faith or creed. See\nVan Orden, 545 U. S., at 688, n. 8 (recognizing that the\nprayers in Marsh were “often explicitly Christian” and\nrejecting the view that this gave rise to an establishment\nviolation). To the contrary, the Court instructed that the\n“content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided\n“there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has\nbeen exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to\ndisparage any other, faith or belief.” 463 U. S., at 794–\n795.\n  To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would\nforce the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors\nand censors of religious speech, a rule that would involve\ngovernment in religious matters to a far greater degree\nthan is the case under the town’s current practice of nei­\nther editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticiz­\ning their content after the fact. Cf. Hosanna-Tabor Evan-\ngelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 13–14). Our Government is\nprohibited from prescribing prayers to be recited in our\npublic institutions in order to promote a preferred system\nof belief or code of moral behavior. Engel v. Vitale, 370\nU. S. 421, 430 (1962). It would be but a few steps removed\nfrom that prohibition for legislatures to require chaplains\nto redact the religious content from their message in order\nto make it acceptable for the public sphere. Government\nmay not mandate a civic religion that stifles any but the\nmost generic reference to the sacred any more than it may\nprescribe a religious orthodoxy. See Lee v. Weisman, 505\nU. S. 577, 590 (1992) (“The suggestion that government\nmay establish an official or civic religion as a means of\navoiding the establishment of a religion with more specific\ncreeds strikes us as a contradiction that cannot be ac-\ncepted”); Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306 (Goldberg, J., concur­\nring) (arguing that “untutored devotion to the concept of\nneutrality” must not lead to “a brooding and pervasive\ndevotion to the secular”).\n  Respondents argue, in effect, that legislative prayer may\nbe addressed only to a generic God. The law and the\nCourt could not draw this line for each specific prayer or\nseek to require ministers to set aside their nuanced and\ndeeply personal beliefs for vague and artificial ones.\nThere is doubt, in any event, that consensus might be\nreached as to what qualifies as generic or nonsectarian.\nHonorifics like “Lord of Lords” or “King of Kings” might\nstrike a Christian audience as ecumenical, yet these titles\nmay have no place in the vocabulary of other faith tradi­\n\f14             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. The difficulty, indeed the futility, of sifting sectarian\nfrom nonsectarian speech is illustrated by a letter that\na lawyer for the respondents sent the town in the early\nstages of this litigation. The letter opined that references\nto “Father, God, Lord God, and the Almighty” would be\nacceptable in public prayer, but that references to “Jesus\nChrist, the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Trinity” would not.\nApp. 21a. Perhaps the writer believed the former group­\ning would be acceptable to monotheists. Yet even seem­\ningly general references to God or the Father might alien­\nate nonbelievers or polytheists. McCreary County v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 893\n(2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because it is unlikely that\nprayer will be inclusive beyond dispute, it would be un­\nwise to adopt what respondents think is the next-best\noption: permitting those religious words, and only those\nwords, that are acceptable to the majority, even if they\nwill exclude some. Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488, 495\n(1961). The First Amendment is not a majority rule, and\ngovernment may not seek to define permissible categories\nof religious speech. Once it invites prayer into the public\nsphere, government must permit a prayer giver to address\nhis or her own God or gods as conscience dictates, unfet­\ntered by what an administrator or judge considers to be\nnonsectarian.\n   In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must\nbe nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no con­\nstraints remain on its content. The relevant constraint\nderives from its place at the opening of legislative ses­\nsions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and\nreflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. Prayer\nthat is solemn and respectful in tone, that invites law­\nmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends\nbefore they embark on the fractious business of governing,\nserves that legitimate function. If the course and practice\nover time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbeliev­\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ners or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach\nconversion, many present may consider the prayer to fall\nshort of the desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion\nand to unite lawmakers in their common effort. That\ncircumstance would present a different case than the one\npresently before the Court.\n   The tradition reflected in Marsh permits chaplains to\nask their own God for blessings of peace, justice, and\nfreedom that find appreciation among people of all faiths.\nThat a prayer is given in the name of Jesus, Allah, or\nJehovah, or that it makes passing reference to religious\ndoctrines, does not remove it from that tradition. These\nreligious themes provide particular means to universal\nends. Prayer that reflects beliefs specific to only some\ncreeds can still serve to solemnize the occasion, so long as\nthe practice over time is not “exploited to proselytize or\nadvance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or be­\nlief.” Marsh, 463 U. S., at 794–795.\n   It is thus possible to discern in the prayers offered to\nCongress a commonality of theme and tone. While these\nprayers vary in their degree of religiosity, they often seek\npeace for the Nation, wisdom for its lawmakers, and jus­\ntice for its people, values that count as universal and that\nare embodied not only in religious traditions, but in our\nfounding documents and laws. The first prayer delivered\nto the Continental Congress by the Rev. Jacob Duché on\nSept. 7, 1774, provides an example:\n      “Be Thou present O God of Wisdom and direct the\n    counsel of this Honorable Assembly; enable them to\n    settle all things on the best and surest foundations;\n    that the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that\n    Order, Harmony, and Peace be effectually restored,\n    and the Truth and Justice, Religion and Piety, prevail\n    and flourish among the people.\n      “Preserve the health of their bodies, and the vigor of\n\f16            TOWN OF GREECE v.

All\n     this we ask in the name and through the merits of\n     Jesus Christ, Thy Son and our Saviour, Amen.” W.\n     Federer, America’s God and Country 137 (2000).\n   From the earliest days of the Nation, these invocations\nhave been addressed to assemblies comprising many\ndifferent creeds. These ceremonial prayers strive for the\nidea that people of many faiths may be united in a com­\nmunity of tolerance and devotion. Even those who dis-\nagree as to religious doctrine may find common ground in\nthe desire to show respect for the divine in all aspects of\ntheir lives and being. Our tradition assumes that adult\ncitizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and per­\nhaps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person\nof a different faith. See Letter from John Adams to Abi­\ngail Adams (Sept. 16, 1774), in C. Adams, Familiar Letters\nof John Adams and His Wife Abigail Adams, During the\nRevolution 37–38 (1876).\n   The prayers delivered in the town of Greece do not fall\noutside the tradition this Court has recognized. A number\nof the prayers did invoke the name of Jesus, the Heavenly\nFather, or the Holy Spirit, but they also invoked universal\nthemes, as by celebrating the changing of the seasons or\ncalling for a “spirit of cooperation” among town leaders.\nApp. 31a, 38a. Among numerous examples of such prayer\nin the record is the invocation given by the Rev. Richard\nBarbour at the September 2006 board meeting:\n     “Gracious God, you have richly blessed our nation\n     and this community. Help us to remember your gen­\n     erosity and give thanks for your goodness. Bless the\n     elected leaders of the Greece Town Board as they con­\n     duct the business of our town this evening.

Respectful of every religious tradition, I offer\n    this prayer in the name of God’s only son Jesus\n    Christ, the Lord, Amen.” Id., at 98a–99a.\n   Respondents point to other invocations that disparaged\nthose who did not accept the town’s prayer practice. One\nguest minister characterized objectors as a “minority” who\nare “ignorant of the history of our country,” id., at 108a,\nwhile another lamented that other towns did not have\n“God-fearing” leaders, id., at 79a. Although these two\nremarks strayed from the rationale set out in Marsh, they\ndo not despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and\nembraces our tradition. Absent a pattern of prayers that\nover time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissi­\nble government purpose, a challenge based solely on the\ncontent of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional\nviolation. Marsh, indeed, requires an inquiry into the\nprayer opportunity as a whole, rather than into the con­\ntents of a single prayer. 463 U. S., at 794–795.\n   Finally, the Court disagrees with the view taken by the\nCourt of Appeals that the town of Greece contravened the\nEstablishment Clause by inviting a predominantly Chris­\ntian set of ministers to lead the prayer. The town made\nreasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations\nlocated within its borders and represented that it would\nwelcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished\nto give one. That nearly all of the congregations in town\nturned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or\nbias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths.\nSo long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimina­\ntion, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond\nits borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to\n\f18            TOWN OF GREECE v.

The quest to promote “a\n‘diversity’ of religious views” would require the town “to\nmake wholly inappropriate judgments about the number\nof religions [it] should sponsor and the relative frequency\nwith which it should sponsor each,” Lee, 505 U. S., at 617\n(Souter, J., concurring), a form of government entangle­\nment with religion that is far more troublesome than the\ncurrent approach.\n                             B\n  Respondents further seek to distinguish the town’s\nprayer practice from the tradition upheld in Marsh on the\nground that it coerces participation by nonadherents.\nThey and some amici contend that prayer conducted in the\nintimate setting of a town board meeting differs in funda­\nmental ways from the invocations delivered in Congress\nand state legislatures, where the public remains segregated\nfrom legislative activity and may not address the body\nexcept by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town\nmeetings, on the other hand, to accept awards; speak on\nmatters of local importance; and petition the board for\naction that may affect their economic interests, such as\nthe granting of permits, business licenses, and zoning\nvariances. Respondents argue that the public may feel\nsubtle pressure to participate in prayers that violate their\nbeliefs in order to please the board members from whom\nthey are about to seek a favorable ruling. In their view\nthe fact that board members in small towns know many of\ntheir constituents by name only increases the pressure to\nconform.\n  It is an elemental First Amendment principle that\ngovernment may not coerce its citizens “to support or\nparticipate in any religion or its exercise.” County of\nAllegheny, 492 U. S., at 659 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); see also Van\nOrden, 545 U. S., at 683 (plurality opinion) (recognizing\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

On the record in this case the Court\nis not persuaded that the town of Greece, through the act\nof offering a brief, solemn, and respectful prayer to open\nits monthly meetings, compelled its citizens to engage in a\nreligious observance. The inquiry remains a fact-sensitive\none that considers both the setting in which the prayer\narises and the audience to whom it is directed.\n   The prayer opportunity in this case must be evaluated\nagainst the backdrop of historical practice. As a practice\nthat has long endured, legislative prayer has become part\nof our heritage and tradition, part of our expressive idiom,\nsimilar to the Pledge of Allegiance, inaugural prayer, or\nthe recitation of “God save the United States and this\nhonorable Court” at the opening of this Court’s sessions.\nSee Lynch, 465 U. S., at 693 (O’Connor, J., concurring). It\nis presumed that the reasonable observer is acquainted\nwith this tradition and understands that its purposes are\nto lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge\nthe place religion holds in the lives of many private citi­\nzens, not to afford government an opportunity to proselyt­\nize or force truant constituents into the pews. See Salazar\nv. Buono, 559 U. S. 700, 720–721 (2010) (plurality opin­\nion); Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S.\n290, 308 (2000). That many appreciate these acknowl­\nedgments of the divine in our public institutions does not\nsuggest that those who disagree are compelled to join the\nexpression or approve its content. West Virginia Bd. of\nEd. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943).\n   The principal audience for these invocations is not,\nindeed, the public but lawmakers themselves, who may\nfind that a moment of prayer or quiet reflection sets the\nmind to a higher purpose and thereby eases the task of\ngoverning. The District Court in Marsh described the\nprayer exercise as “an internal act” directed at the Ne­\nbraska Legislature’s “own members,” Chambers v. Marsh,\n\f20             TOWN OF GREECE v.

But their\npurpose is largely to accommodate the spiritual needs of\nlawmakers and connect them to a tradition dating to the\ntime of the Framers. For members of town boards and\ncommissions, who often serve part-time and as volunteers,\nceremonial prayer may also reflect the values they hold as\nprivate citizens. The prayer is an opportunity for them to\nshow who and what they are without denying the right to\ndissent by those who disagree.\n   The analysis would be different if town board members\ndirected the public to participate in the prayers, singled\nout dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their\ndecisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence\nin the prayer opportunity. No such thing occurred in the\ntown of Greece. Although board members themselves\nstood, bowed their heads, or made the sign of the cross\nduring the prayer, they at no point solicited similar ges­\ntures by the public. Respondents point to several occa­\nsions where audience members were asked to rise for the\nprayer. These requests, however, came not from town\nleaders but from the guest ministers, who presumably are\naccustomed to directing their congregations in this way\nand might have done so thinking the action was inclusive,\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

Respondents suggest that constituents\nmight feel pressure to join the prayers to avoid irritating\nthe officials who would be ruling on their petitions, but\nthis argument has no evidentiary support. Nothing in the\nrecord indicates that town leaders allocated benefits and\nburdens based on participation in the prayer, or that\ncitizens were received differently depending on whether\nthey joined the invocation or quietly declined. In no in­\nstance did town leaders signal disfavor toward nonpartici­\npants or suggest that their stature in the community was\nin any way diminished. A practice that classified citizens\nbased on their religious views would violate the Constitu­\ntion, but that is not the case before this Court.\n   In their declarations in the trial court, respondents\nstated that the prayers gave them offense and made them\nfeel excluded and disrespected. Offense, however, does not\nequate to coercion. Adults often encounter speech they\nfind disagreeable; and an Establishment Clause violation\nis not made out any time a person experiences a sense of\naffront from the expression of contrary religious views in a\nlegislative forum, especially where, as here, any member\nof the public is welcome in turn to offer an invocation\nreflecting his or her own convictions. See Elk Grove Uni-\nfied School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 44 (2004)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring) (“The compulsion of which\nJustice Jackson was concerned . . . was of the direct sort—\nthe Constitution does not guarantee citizens a right\nentirely to avoid ideas with which they disagree”).

But the showing has not been made here,\nwhere the prayers neither chastised dissenters nor at­\ntempted lengthy disquisition on religious dogma. Courts\nremain free to review the pattern of prayers over time to\ndetermine whether they comport with the tradition of\nsolemn, respectful prayer approved in Marsh, or whether\ncoercion is a real and substantial likelihood. But in the\ngeneral course legislative bodies do not engage in imper­\nmissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer\nthey would rather not hear and in which they need not\nparticipate. See County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 670\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent­\ning in part).\n  This case can be distinguished from the conclusions and\nholding of Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577. There the Court\nfound that, in the context of a graduation where school\nauthorities maintained close supervision over the conduct\nof the students and the substance of the ceremony, a\nreligious invocation was coercive as to an objecting stu­\ndent. Id., at 592–594; see also Santa Fe Independent\nSchool Dist., 530 U. S., at 312. Four Justices dissented in\nLee, but the circumstances the Court confronted there are\nnot present in this case and do not control its outcome.\nNothing in the record suggests that members of the public\nare dissuaded from leaving the meeting room during the\nprayer, arriving late, or even, as happened here, making a\nlater protest. In this case, as in Marsh, board members\nand constituents are “free to enter and leave with little\ncomment and for any number of reasons.” Lee, supra, at\n597. Should nonbelievers choose to exit the room during a\nprayer they find distasteful, their absence will not stand\nout as disrespectful or even noteworthy. And should they\nremain, their quiet acquiescence will not, in light of our\ntraditions, be interpreted as an agreement with the words\nor ideas expressed. Neither choice represents an unconsti­\ntutional imposition as to mature adults, who “presumably”\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

S., at 792 (internal quota­\ntion marks and citations omitted).\n   In the town of Greece, the prayer is delivered during the\nceremonial portion of the town’s meeting. Board members\nare not engaged in policymaking at this time, but in more\ngeneral functions, such as swearing in new police officers,\ninducting high school athletes into the town hall of fame,\nand presenting proclamations to volunteers, civic groups,\nand senior citizens. It is a moment for town leaders to\nrecognize the achievements of their constituents and the\naspects of community life that are worth celebrating. By\ninviting ministers to serve as chaplain for the month, and\nwelcoming them to the front of the room alongside civic\nleaders, the town is acknowledging the central place that\nreligion, and religious institutions, hold in the lives of\nthose present. Indeed, some congregations are not simply\nspiritual homes for town residents but also the provider of\nsocial services for citizens regardless of their beliefs. See\nApp. 31a (thanking a pastor for his “community involve­\nment”); id., at 44a (thanking a deacon “for the job that you\nhave done on behalf of our community”). The inclusion of\na brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise in\ncivic recognition suggests that its purpose and effect are to\nacknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they\nrepresent rather than to exclude or coerce nonbelievers.\n   Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this\nNation was founded and until the present day, many\nAmericans deem that their own existence must be under­\nstood by precepts far beyond the authority of government\nto alter or define and that willing participation in civic\naffairs can be consistent with a brief acknowledgment of\ntheir belief in a higher power, always with due respect for\nthose who adhere to other beliefs. The prayer in this case\nhas a permissible ceremonial purpose. It is not an uncon­\nstitutional establishment of religion.\n\f24            TOWN OF GREECE v.

The town decided\nto emulate a practice long established in Congress and\nstate legislatures by having a brief prayer before sessions\nof the town board. The task of lining up clergy members\nwilling to provide such a prayer was given to the town’s\noffice of constituent services. 732 F. Supp. 2d 195, 197–\n198 (WDNY 2010). For the first four years of the practice,\na clerical employee in the office would randomly call reli­\ngious organizations listed in the Greece “Community\nGuide,” a local directory published by the Greece Chamber\nof Commerce, until she was able to find somebody willing\nto give the invocation. Id., at 198. This employee eventu­\n\f2                TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                         ALITO, J., concurring\n\nally began keeping a list of individuals who had agreed to\ngive the invocation, and when a second clerical employee\ntook over the task of finding prayer-givers, the first em­\nployee gave that list to the second. Id., at 198, 199. The\nsecond employee then randomly called organizations on\nthat list—and possibly others in the Community Guide—\nuntil she found someone who agreed to provide the prayer.\nId., at 199.\n  Apparently, all the houses of worship listed in the local\nCommunity Guide were Christian churches. Id., at 198–\n200, 203. That is unsurprising given the small number of\nnon-Christians in the area. Although statistics for the\ntown of Greece alone do not seem to be available, statistics\nhave been compiled for Monroe County, which includes\nboth the town of Greece and the city of Rochester. Accord­\ning to these statistics, of the county residents who have a\nreligious affiliation, about 3% are Jewish, and for other\nnon-Christian faiths, the percentages are smaller.1 There\nare no synagogues within the borders of the town of\nGreece, id., at 203, but there are several not far away\nacross the Rochester border. Presumably, Jewish resi­\ndents of the town worship at one or more of those syna­\ngogues, but because these synagogues fall outside the\ntown’s borders, they were not listed in the town’s local\ndirectory, and the responsible town employee did not\ninclude them on her list. Ibid. Nor did she include any\nother non-Christian house of worship. Id., at 198–200.2\n——————\n  1 See Assn. of Statisticians of Am. Religious Bodies, C. Grammich\n\net al., 2010 U. S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations & Member­\nship Study 400–401 (2012).\n  2 It appears that there is one non-Christian house of worship, a Bud­\n\ndhist temple, within the town’s borders, but it was not listed in the\ntown directory. 732 F. Supp. 2d, at 203. Although located within the\ntown’s borders, the temple has a Rochester mailing address. And while\nthe respondents “each lived in the Town more than thirty years, neither\nwas personally familiar with any mosques, synagogues, temples, or\nother non-Christian places of worship within the Town.” Id., at 197.\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

But respondents do not claim that\nthe list was attributable to religious bias or favoritism,\nand the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the town had\n“no religious animus.” 681 F. 3d 20, 32 (CA2 2012).\n  For some time, the town’s practice does not appear to\nhave elicited any criticism, but when complaints were\nreceived, the town made it clear that it would permit any\ninterested residents, including nonbelievers, to provide an\ninvocation, and the town has never refused a request to\noffer an invocation. Id., at 23, 25; 732 F. Supp. 2d, at 197.\nThe most recent list in the record of persons available to\nprovide an invocation includes representatives of many\nnon-Christian faiths. App. in No. 10–3635 (CA2), pp.\nA1053–A1055 (hereinafter CA2 App.).\n  Meetings of the Greece Town Board appear to have been\nsimilar to most other town council meetings across the\ncountry. The prayer took place at the beginning of the\nmeetings. The board then conducted what might be\ntermed the “legislative” portion of its agenda, during\nwhich residents were permitted to address the board.\nAfter this portion of the meeting, a separate stage of the\nmeetings was devoted to such matters as formal requests\nfor variances. See Brief for Respondents 5–6; CA2 App.\nA929–A930; e.g., CA2 App. A1058, A1060.\n  No prayer occurred before this second part of the pro­\nceedings, and therefore I do not understand this case to\ninvolve the constitutionality of a prayer prior to what may\nbe characterized as an adjudicatory proceeding. The\nprayer preceded only the portion of the town board meet­\ning that I view as essentially legislative. While it is true\nthat the matters considered by the board during this\ninitial part of the meeting might involve very specific\nquestions, such as the installation of a traffic light or stop\n\f4                 TOWN OF GREECE v.

According to the\nprincipal dissent, the town could have avoided any consti­\ntutional problem in either of two ways.\n                              A\n  First, the principal dissent writes, “[i]f the Town Board\nhad let its chaplains know that they should speak in non­\nsectarian terms, common to diverse religious groups, then\nno one would have valid grounds for complaint.” Post, at\n18–19. “Priests and ministers, rabbis and imams,” the\nprincipal dissent continues, “give such invocations all the\ntime” without any great difficulty. Post, at 19.\n  Both Houses of Congress now advise guest chaplains\nthat they should keep in mind that they are addressing\nmembers from a variety of faith traditions, and as a mat­\nter of policy, this advice has much to recommend it. But\nany argument that nonsectarian prayer is constitutionally\nrequired runs headlong into a long history of contrary\ncongressional practice. From the beginning, as the Court\nnotes, many Christian prayers were offered in the House\nand Senate, see ante, at 7, and when rabbis and other non-\nChristian clergy have served as guest chaplains, their\nprayers have often been couched in terms particular to\ntheir faith traditions.3\n——————\n  3 For example, when a rabbi first delivered a prayer at a session of\n\nthe House of Representatives in 1860, he appeared “in full rabbinic\ndress, ‘piously bedecked in a white tallit and a large velvet skullcap,’ ”\nand his prayer “invoked several uniquely Jewish themes and repeated\nthe Biblical priestly blessing in Hebrew.” See Brief for Nathan Lewin\nas Amicus Curiae 9. Many other rabbis have given distinctively Jewish\nprayers, id., at 10, and n. 3, and distinctively Islamic, Buddhist, and\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                         ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   Not only is there no historical support for the proposi­\ntion that only generic prayer is allowed, but as our country\nhas become more diverse, composing a prayer that is\nacceptable to all members of the community who hold\nreligious beliefs has become harder and harder. It was\none thing to compose a prayer that is acceptable to both\nChristians and Jews; it is much harder to compose a prayer\nthat is also acceptable to followers of Eastern religions\nthat are now well represented in this country. Many local\nclergy may find the project daunting, if not impossible,\nand some may feel that they cannot in good faith deliver\nsuch a vague prayer.\n   In addition, if a town attempts to go beyond simply\nrecommending that a guest chaplain deliver a prayer that\nis broadly acceptable to all members of a particular com­\nmunity (and the groups represented in different communi­\nties will vary), the town will inevitably encounter sensitive\nproblems. Must a town screen and, if necessary, edit\nprayers before they are given? If prescreening is not\nrequired, must the town review prayers after they are\ndelivered in order to determine if they were sufficiently\ngeneric? And if a guest chaplain crosses the line, what\nmust the town do? Must the chaplain be corrected on the\nspot? Must the town strike this chaplain (and perhaps his\nor her house of worship) from the approved list?\n                              B\n  If a town wants to avoid the problems associated with\nthis first option, the principal dissent argues, it has an­\nother choice: It may “invit[e] clergy of many faiths.” Post,\nat 19. “When one month a clergy member refers to Jesus,\nand the next to Allah or Jehovah,” the principal dissent\nexplains, “the government does not identify itself with one\nreligion or align itself with that faith’s citizens, and the\n—————— \n\nHindu prayers have also been delivered, see ante, at 10–11. \n\n\f6             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\neffect of even sectarian prayer is transformed.” Ibid.\n   If, as the principal dissent appears to concede, such a\nrotating system would obviate any constitutional prob­\nlems, then despite all its high rhetoric, the principal dis­\nsent’s quarrel with the town of Greece really boils down to\nthis: The town’s clerical employees did a bad job in compil­\ning the list of potential guest chaplains. For that is really\nthe only difference between what the town did and what\nthe principal dissent is willing to accept. The Greece\nclerical employee drew up her list using the town directory\ninstead of a directory covering the entire greater Roches­\nter area. If the task of putting together the list had been\nhandled in a more sophisticated way, the employee in\ncharge would have realized that the town’s Jewish resi­\ndents attended synagogues on the Rochester side of the\nborder and would have added one or more synagogues to\nthe list. But the mistake was at worst careless, and it was\nnot done with a discriminatory intent. (I would view this\ncase very differently if the omission of these synagogues\nwere intentional.)\n   The informal, imprecise way in which the town lined up\nguest chaplains is typical of the way in which many things\nare done in small and medium-sized units of local govern­\nment. In such places, the members of the governing body\nalmost always have day jobs that occupy much of their\ntime. The town almost never has a legal office and instead\nrelies for legal advice on a local attorney whose practice is\nlikely to center on such things as land-use regulation,\ncontracts, and torts. When a municipality like the town of\nGreece seeks in good faith to emulate the congressional\npractice on which our holding in Marsh v. Chambers, 463\nU. S. 783 (1983), was largely based, that municipality\nshould not be held to have violated the Constitution sim­\nply because its method of recruiting guest chaplains lacks\nthe demographic exactitude that might be regarded as\noptimal.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   The effect of requiring such exactitude would be to\npressure towns to forswear altogether the practice of\nhaving a prayer before meetings of the town council.\nMany local officials, puzzled by our often puzzling Estab­\nlishment Clause jurisprudence and terrified of the legal\nfees that may result from a lawsuit claiming a constitu­\ntional violation, already think that the safest course is to\nensure that local government is a religion-free zone.\nIndeed, the Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case advised\ntowns that constitutional difficulties “may well prompt\nmunicipalities to pause and think carefully before adopt­\ning legislative prayer.” 681 F. 3d, at 34. But if, as prece­\ndent and historic practice make clear (and the principal\ndissent concedes), prayer before a legislative session is not\ninherently inconsistent with the First Amendment, then a\nunit of local government should not be held to have violated\nthe First Amendment simply because its procedure for\nlining up guest chaplains does not comply in all respects\nwith what might be termed a “best practices” standard.\n                               III\n   While the principal dissent, in the end, would demand\nno more than a small modification in the procedure that\nthe town of Greece initially followed, much of the rhetoric\nin that opinion sweeps more broadly. Indeed, the logical\nthrust of many of its arguments is that prayer is never\npermissible prior to meetings of local government legisla­\ntive bodies. At Greece Town Board meetings, the principal\ndissent pointedly notes, ordinary citizens (and even chil­\ndren!) are often present. Post, at 10–11. The guest chap­\nlains stand in front of the room facing the public. “[T]he\nsetting is intimate,” and ordinary citizens are permitted to\nspeak and to ask the board to address problems that have\na direct effect on their lives. Post, at 11. The meetings are\n“occasions for ordinary citizens to engage with and peti­\ntion their government, often on highly individualized\n\f8                TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                          ALITO, J., concurring\n\nmatters.” Post, at 9. Before a session of this sort, the\nprincipal dissent argues, any prayer that is not acceptable\nto all in attendance is out of bounds.\n  The features of Greece meetings that the principal\ndissent highlights are by no means unusual.4 It is com­\nmon for residents to attend such meetings, either to speak\non matters on the agenda or to request that the town\naddress other issues that are important to them. Nor is\nthere anything unusual about the occasional attendance of\nstudents, and when a prayer is given at the beginning of\nsuch a meeting, I expect that the chaplain generally\nstands at the front of the room and faces the public. To do\notherwise would probably be seen by many as rude. Fi-\nnally, although the principal dissent, post, at 13, attaches\nimportance to the fact that guest chaplains in the town of\nGreece often began with the words “Let us pray,” that is\nalso commonplace and for many clergy, I suspect, almost\nreflexive.5 In short, I see nothing out of the ordinary\nabout any of the features that the principal dissent notes.\nTherefore, if prayer is not allowed at meetings with those\ncharacteristics, local government legislative bodies, unlike\ntheir national and state counterparts, cannot begin their\nmeetings with a prayer. I see no sound basis for drawing\nsuch a distinction.\n\n\n——————\n    4 See,\n         e.g., prayer practice of Saginaw City Council in Michigan, de­\nscribed in Letter from Freedom from Religion Foundation to City\nManager, Saginaw City Council (Jan. 31, 2014), online at\nhttp://media.mlive.com/saginawnews_impact/other/Saginaw%20prayer\n%20at%20meetings%20letter.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May\n2, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); prayer practice of\nCobb County commissions in Georgia, described in Pelphrey v.

Chambers, which upheld the constitu­\ntionality of the Nebraska Legislature’s practice of prayer\nat the beginning of legislative sessions, but the principal\ndissent’s acceptance of Marsh appears to be predicated on\nthe view that the prayer at issue in that case was little\nmore than a formality to which the legislators paid scant\nattention. The principal dissent describes this scene: A\nsession of the state legislature begins with or without\nmost members present; a strictly nonsectarian prayer is\nrecited while some legislators remain seated; and few\nmembers of the public are exposed to the experience. Post,\nat 8–9. This sort of perfunctory and hidden-away prayer,\nthe principal dissent implies, is all that Marsh and the\nFirst Amendment can tolerate.\n   It is questionable whether the principal dissent accu­\nrately describes the Nebraska practice at issue in Marsh,6\nbut what is important is not so much what happened in\nNebraska in the years prior to Marsh, but what happened\nbefore congressional sessions during the period leading up\nto the adoption of the First Amendment.

The First Continental Congress convened in Phila­\ndelphia, and the need for the 13 colonies to unite was\nimperative. But “[m]any things set colony apart from\ncolony,” and prominent among these sources of division\nwas religion.7 “Purely as a practical matter,” however, the\nproject of bringing the colonies together required that\nthese divisions be overcome.8\n   Samuel Adams sought to bridge these differences by\nprodding a fellow Massachusetts delegate to move to open\nthe session with a prayer.9 As John Adams later recounted,\nthis motion was opposed on the ground that the dele-\ngates were “so divided in religious sentiments, some Epis­\ncopalians, some Quakers, some Anabaptists, some\nPresbyterians, and some Congregationalists, that [they]\ncould not join in the same act of worship.”10 In response,\nSamuel Adams proclaimed that “he was no bigot, and\ncould hear a prayer from a gentleman of piety and virtue,\nwho was at the same time a friend to his country.”11 Put­\nting aside his personal prejudices,12 he moved to invite a\nlocal Anglican minister, Jacob Duché, to lead the first\nprayer.13\n   The following morning, Duché appeared in full “pontifi­\n——————\n   7 G.

But\nDuché’s prayer met with wide approval—John Adams\nwrote that it “filled the bosom of every man” in attend­\nance15—and the practice was continued. This first con­\ngressional prayer was emphatically Christian, and it was\nneither an empty formality nor strictly nondenominational.16\nBut one of its purposes, and presumably one of its\neffects, was not to divide, but to unite.\n   It is no wonder, then, that the practice of beginning\ncongressional sessions with a prayer was continued after\nthe Revolution ended and the new Constitution was\nadopted. One of the first actions taken by the new Con­\ngress when it convened in 1789 was to appoint chaplains\nfor both Houses. The first Senate chaplain, an Episcopa-\nlian, was appointed on April 25, 1789, and the first House\nchaplain, a Presbyterian, was appointed on May 1.17\nThree days later, Madison announced that he planned to\nintroduce proposed constitutional amendments to protect\nindividual rights; on June 8, 1789, those amendments\nwere introduced; and on September 26, 1789, the amend­\nments were approved to be sent to the States for ratifica­\ntion.18 In the years since the adoption of the First\n——————\n  14 Ibid.\n  15 Ibid.; see W.

GALLOWAY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nAmendment, the practice of prayer before sessions of the\nHouse and Senate has continued, and opening prayers\nfrom a great variety of faith traditions have been offered.\n  This Court has often noted that actions taken by the\nFirst Congress are presumptively consistent with the Bill\nof Rights, see, e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957,\n980 (1991), Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 150–\n152 (1925), and this principle has special force when it\ncomes to the interpretation of the Establishment Clause.\nThis Court has always purported to base its Establish­\nment Clause decisions on the original meaning of that\nprovision. Thus, in Marsh, when the Court was called\nupon to decide whether prayer prior to sessions of a state\nlegislature was consistent with the Establishment Clause,\nwe relied heavily on the history of prayer before sessions\nof Congress and held that a state legislature may follow a\nsimilar practice. See 463 U. S., at 786–792.\n  There can be little doubt that the decision in Marsh\nreflected the original understanding of the First Amend­\nment. It is virtually inconceivable that the First Congress,\nhaving appointed chaplains whose responsibilities promi­\nnently included the delivery of prayers at the beginning of\neach daily session, thought that this practice was incon­\nsistent with the Establishment Clause. And since this\npractice was well established and undoubtedly well\nknown, it seems equally clear that the state legislatures\nthat ratified the First Amendment had the same under­\nstanding. In the case before us, the Court of Appeals\nappeared to base its decision on one of the Establishment\nClause “tests” set out in the opinions of this Court, see 681\nF. 3d, at 26, 30, but if there is any inconsistency between\nany of those tests and the historic practice of legislative\nprayer, the inconsistency calls into question the validity of\nthe test, not the historic practice.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

I am troubled by the\nmessage that some readers may take from the principal\ndissent’s rhetoric and its highly imaginative hypotheticals.\nFor example, the principal dissent conjures up the image\nof a litigant awaiting trial who is asked by the presiding\njudge to rise for a Christian prayer, of an official at a\npolling place who conveys the expectation that citizens\nwishing to vote make the sign of the cross before casting\ntheir ballots, and of an immigrant seeking naturalization\nwho is asked to bow her head and recite a Christian\nprayer. Although I do not suggest that the implication is\nintentional, I am concerned that at least some readers will\ntake these hypotheticals as a warning that this is where\ntoday’s decision leads—to a country in which religious\nminorities are denied the equal benefits of citizenship.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. All that the\nCourt does today is to allow a town to follow a practice\nthat we have previously held is permissible for Congress\nand state legislatures. In seeming to suggest otherwise,\nthe principal dissent goes far astray.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

If the Establishment Clause is not\nincorporated, then it has no application here, where only\nmunicipal action is at issue.\n  As an initial matter, the Clause probably prohibits\nCongress from establishing a national religion.

The text of the Clause also suggests that Congress\n“could not interfere with state establishments, notwith-\nstanding any argument that could be made based on\nCongress’ power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.”\nNewdow, supra, at 50 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The lan-\nguage of the First Amendment (“Congress shall make no\nlaw”) “precisely tracked and inverted the exact wording” of\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause (“Congress shall have\npower . . . to make all laws which shall be necessary and\nproper . . . ”), which was the subject of fierce criticism by\nAnti-Federalists at the time of ratification. A. Amar, The\nBill of Rights 39 (1998) (hereinafter Amar); see also Natel-\nson, The Framing and Adoption of the Necessary and\nProper Clause, in The Origins of the Necessary and Proper\nClause 84, 94–96 (G. Lawson, G. Miller, R. Natelson,\n& G. Seidman eds. 2010) (summarizing Anti-Federalist\nclaims that the Necessary and Proper Clause would ag-\ngrandize the powers of the Federal Government). That\nchoice of language—“Congress shall make no law”—\neffectively denied Congress any power to regulate state\nestablishments.\n  Construing the Establishment Clause as a federalism\nprovision accords with the variety of church-state ar-\nrangements that existed at the Founding. At least six\nStates had established churches in 1789.

Virginia, by contrast, had\nrecently abolished its official state establishment and\nended direct government funding of clergy after a legisla-\ntive battle led by James Madison. See T. Buckley, Church\nand State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776–1787, pp. 155–\n164 (1977).      Other States—principally Rhode Island,\nPennsylvania, and Delaware, which were founded by\nreligious dissenters—had no history of formal establish-\nments at all, although they still maintained religious tests\nfor office. See McConnell, The Origins and Historical\nUnderstanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1409, 1425–1426, 1430 (1990).\n   The import of this history is that the relationship be-\ntween church and state in the fledgling Republic was far\nfrom settled at the time of ratification. See Muñoz, The\nOriginal Meaning of the Establishment Clause and the\nImpossibility of Its Incorporation, 8 U. Pa. J. Constitu-\ntional L. 585, 605 (2006). Although the remaining state\nestablishments were ultimately dismantled—Massachusetts,\nthe last State to disestablish, would do so in 1833, see Levy\n42—that outcome was far from assured when the Bill of\nRights was ratified in 1791. That lack of consensus sug-\ngests that the First Amendment was simply agnostic on\nthe subject of state establishments; the decision to estab-\nlish or disestablish religion was reserved to the States.\nAmar 41.\n   The Federalist logic of the original Establishment\nClause poses a special barrier to its mechanical incorpora-\ntion against the States through the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. See id., at 33. Unlike the Free Exercise Clause,\nwhich “plainly protects individuals against congressional\ninterference with the right to exercise their religion,” the\n\f4             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nEstablishment Clause “does not purport to protect indi-\nvidual rights.” Newdow, 542 U. S., at 50 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Instead, the States are the particular benefi-\nciaries of the Clause. Incorporation therefore gives rise to\na paradoxical result: Applying the Clause against the\nStates eliminates their right to establish a religion free\nfrom federal interference, thereby “prohibit[ing] exactly\nwhat the Establishment Clause protected.” Id., at 51; see\nAmar 33–34.\n    Put differently, the structural reasons that counsel\nagainst incorporating the Tenth Amendment also apply to\nthe Establishment Clause. Id., at 34. To my knowledge,\nno court has ever suggested that the Tenth Amendment,\nwhich “reserve[s] to the States” powers not delegated to\nthe Federal Government, could or should be applied\nagainst the States. To incorporate that limitation would\nbe to divest the States of all powers not specifically dele-\ngated to them, thereby inverting the original import of the\nAmendment. Incorporating the Establishment Clause has\nprecisely the same effect.\n    The most cogent argument in favor of incorporation may\nbe that, by the time of Reconstruction, the framers of the\nFourteenth Amendment had come to reinterpret the Es-\ntablishment Clause (notwithstanding its Federalist ori-\ngins) as expressing an individual right. On this question,\nhistorical evidence from the 1860’s is mixed. Congressmen\nwho catalogued the personal rights protected by the First\nAmendment commonly referred to speech, press, petition,\nand assembly, but not to a personal right of nonestablish-\nment; instead, they spoke only of “ ‘free exercise’ ” or\n“ ‘freedom of conscience.’ ” Amar 253, and 385, n. 91 (col-\nlecting sources). There may be reason to think these lists\nwere abbreviated, and silence on the issue is not disposi-\ntive. See Lash, The Second Adoption of the Establishment\nClause: The Rise of the Nonestablishment Principle, 27\nAriz. St. L. J. 1085, 1141–1145 (1995); but cf. S.

Given the\ntextual and logical difficulties posed by incorporation,\nhowever, there is no warrant for transforming the mean-\ning of the Establishment Clause without a firm historical\nfoundation.    See Newdow, supra, at 51 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). The burden of persuasion therefore rests\nwith those who claim that the Clause assumed a different\nmeaning upon adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.1\n                             II\n  Even if the Establishment Clause were properly incor-\nporated against the States, the municipal prayers at issue\nin this case bear no resemblance to the coercive state\nestablishments that existed at the founding. “The coercion\nthat was a hallmark of historical establishments of reli-\ngion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial\nsupport by force of law and threat of penalty.” Lee v.\nWeisman, 505 U. S. 577, 640 (1992) (SCALIA, J., dissent-\n——————\n   1 This Court has never squarely addressed these barriers to the in-\n\ncorporation of the Establishment Clause. When the issue was first\npresented in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), the\nCourt casually asserted that “the Fourteenth Amendment [has been]\ninterpreted to make the prohibitions of the First applicable to state\naction abridging religious freedom. There is every reason to give the\nsame application and broad interpretation to the ‘establishment of\nreligion’ clause.” Id., at 15 (footnote omitted). The cases the Court\ncited in support of that proposition involved the Free Exercise Clause—\nwhich had been incorporated seven years earlier, in Cantwell v. Con-\nnecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940)—not the Establishment Clause. 330\nU. S., at 15, n. 22 (collecting cases). Thus, in the space of a single\nparagraph and a nonresponsive string citation, the Everson Court glibly\neffected a sea change in constitutional law. The Court’s inattention to\nthese doctrinal questions might be explained, although not excused, by\nthe rise of popular conceptions about “separation of church and state”\nas an “American” constitutional right. See generally P. Hamburger,\nSeparation of Church and State 454–463 (2002); see also id., at 391–\n454 (discussing the role of nativist sentiment in the campaign for\n“separation” as an American ideal).\n\f6             TOWN OF GREECE v.

In a typical case, attendance at the estab-\nlished church was mandatory, and taxes were levied to\ngenerate church revenue. McConnell, Establishment and\nDisestablishment, at 2144–2146, 2152–2159. Dissenting\nministers were barred from preaching, and political partic-\nipation was limited to members of the established church.\nId., at 2161–2168, 2176–2180.\n   This is not to say that the state establishments in exist-\nence when the Bill of Rights was ratified were uniform.\nAs previously noted, establishments in the South were\ntypically governed through the state legislature or State\nConstitution, while establishments in New England were\nadministered at the municipal level. See supra, at 2–3.\nNotwithstanding these variations, both state and local\nforms of establishment involved “actual legal coercion,”\nNewdow, supra, at 52 (opinion of THOMAS, J.): They exer-\ncised government power in order to exact financial support\nof the church, compel religious observance, or control\nreligious doctrine.\n   None of these founding-era state establishments re-\nmained at the time of Reconstruction. But even assuming\nthat the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment recon-\nceived the nature of the Establishment Clause as a con-\nstraint on the States, nothing in the history of the inter-\nvening period suggests a fundamental transformation in\ntheir understanding of what constituted an establishment.\nAt a minimum, there is no support for the proposition that\nthe framers of the Fourteenth Amendment embraced\nwholly modern notions that the Establishment Clause is\nviolated whenever the “reasonable observer” feels “subtle\npressure,” ante, at 18, 19, or perceives governmental “en-\ndors[ement],” ante, at 5–6.

Moreover, the\nstate constitutional provisions that prohibited religious\n“comp[ulsion]” made clear that the relevant sort of com-\npulsion was legal in nature, of the same type that had\ncharacterized founding-era establishments.2 These provi-\nsions strongly suggest that, whatever nonestablishment\nprinciples existed in 1868, they included no concern for the\nfiner sensibilities of the “reasonable observer.”\n   Thus, to the extent coercion is relevant to the Estab-\nlishment Clause analysis, it is actual legal coercion that\ncounts—not the “subtle coercive pressures” allegedly felt\nby respondents in this case, ante, at 9.

GALLOWAY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntional speaker.” Id., at 31–32 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   The Court of Appeals further emphasized what it was\nnot holding. It did not hold that “the town may not open\nits public meetings with a prayer,” or that “any prayers\noffered in this context must be blandly ‘nonsectarian.’ ”\nId., at 33. In essence, the Court of Appeals merely held\nthat the town must do more than it had previously done to\ntry to make its prayer practices inclusive of other faiths.\nAnd it did not prescribe a single constitutionally required\nmethod for doing so.\n   In my view, the Court of Appeals’ conclusion and its\nreasoning are convincing. JUSTICE KAGAN’s dissent is\nconsistent with that view, and I join it. I also here empha-\nsize several factors that I believe underlie the conclusion\nthat, on the particular facts of this case, the town’s prayer\npractice violated the Establishment Clause.\n   First, Greece is a predominantly Christian town, but it\nis not exclusively so. A map of the town’s houses of wor-\nship introduced in the District Court shows many Chris-\ntian churches within the town’s limits. It also shows a\nBuddhist temple within the town and several Jewish\nsynagogues just outside its borders, in the adjacent city of\nRochester, New York. Id., at 24. Yet during the more\nthan 120 monthly meetings at which prayers were deliv-\nered during the record period (from 1999 to 2010), only\nfour prayers were delivered by non-Christians. And all of\nthese occurred in 2008, shortly after the plaintiffs began\ncomplaining about the town’s Christian prayer practice\nand nearly a decade after that practice had commenced.\nSee post, at 14, 21.\n   To be precise: During 2008, two prayers were delivered\nby a Jewish layman, one by the chairman of a Baha’i\ncongregation, and one by a Wiccan priestess. The Jewish\nand Wiccan prayer givers were invited only after they\nreached out to the town to inquire about giving an invoca-\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion. The town apparently invited the Baha’i chairman on\nits own initiative. The inclusivity of the 2008 meetings,\nwhich contrasts starkly with the exclusively single-\ndenomination prayers every year before and after, is\ncommendable. But the Court of Appeals reasonably de-\ncided not to give controlling weight to that inclusivity, for it\narose only in response to the complaints that presaged this\nlitigation, and it did not continue into the following years.\n   Second, the town made no significant effort to inform\nthe area’s non-Christian houses of worship about the\npossibility of delivering an opening prayer. See post, at\n21. Beginning in 1999, when it instituted its practice of\nopening its monthly board meetings with prayer, Greece\nselected prayer givers as follows: Initially, the town’s\nemployees invited clergy from each religious organization\nlisted in a “Community Guide” published by the Greece\nChamber of Commerce. After that, the town kept a list of\nclergy who had accepted invitations and reinvited those\nclergy to give prayers at future meetings. From time to\ntime, the town supplemented this list in response to re-\nquests from citizens and to new additions to the Commu-\nnity Guide and a town newspaper called the Greece Post.\n   The plaintiffs do not argue that the town intentionally\ndiscriminated against non-Christians when choosing\nwhom to invite, 681 F. 3d, at 26, and the town claims,\nplausibly, that it would have allowed anyone who asked to\ngive an invocation to do so. Rather, the evident reasons\nwhy the town consistently chose Christian prayer givers\nare that the Buddhist and Jewish temples mentioned\nabove were not listed in the Community Guide or the\nGreece Post and that the town limited its list of clergy\nalmost exclusively to representatives of houses of worship\nsituated within Greece’s town limits (again, the Buddhist\ntemple on the map was within those limits, but the syna-\ngogues were just outside them). Id., at 24, 31.\n   Third, in this context, the fact that nearly all of the\n\f4             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprayers given reflected a single denomination takes on\nsignificance. That significance would have been the same\nhad all the prayers been Jewish, or Hindu, or Buddhist, or\nof any other denomination. The significance is that, in a\ncontext where religious minorities exist and where more\ncould easily have been done to include their participation,\nthe town chose to do nothing. It could, for example, have\nposted its policy of permitting anyone to give an invocation\non its website, greeceny.gov, which provides dates and\ntimes of upcoming town board meetings along with\nminutes of prior meetings. It could have announced inclu-\nsive policies at the beginning of its board meetings, just\nbefore introducing the month’s prayer giver. It could have\nprovided information to those houses of worship of all\nfaiths that lie just outside its borders and include citizens\nof Greece among their members. Given that the town\ncould easily have made these or similar efforts but chose\nnot to, the fact that all of the prayers (aside from the 2008\noutliers) were given by adherents of a single religion re-\nflects a lack of effort to include others. And that is what I\ntake to be a major point of JUSTICE KAGAN’s related dis-\ncussion. See post, at 2–4, 9, 14–15, 21–23.\n   Fourth, the fact that the board meeting audience in-\ncluded citizens with business to conduct also contributes\nto the importance of making more of an effort to include\nmembers of other denominations. It does not, however,\nautomatically change the nature of the meeting from one\nwhere an opening prayer is permissible under the Estab-\nlishment Clause to one where it is not. Cf. post, at 8–14,\n16–17, 20.\n   Fifth, it is not normally government’s place to rewrite,\nto parse, or to critique the language of particular prayers.\nAnd it is always possible that members of one religious\ngroup will find that prayers of other groups (or perhaps\neven a moment of silence) are not compatible with their\nfaith. Despite this risk, the Constitution does not forbid\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nopening prayers. But neither does the Constitution forbid\nefforts to explain to those who give the prayers the nature\nof the occasion and the audience.\n   The U. S. House of Representatives, for example, pro-\nvides its guest chaplains with the following guidelines,\nwhich are designed to encourage the sorts of prayer that\nare consistent with the purpose of an invocation for a\ngovernment body in a religiously pluralistic Nation:\n    “The guest chaplain should keep in mind that the\n    House of Representatives is comprised of Members of\n    many different faith traditions.\n    “The length of the prayer should not exceed 150\n    words.\n    “The prayer must be free from personal political views\n    or partisan politics, from sectarian controversies, and\n    from any intimations pertaining to foreign or domestic\n    policy.” App. to Brief for Respondents 2a.\nThe town made no effort to promote a similarly inclusive\nprayer practice here. See post, at 21–22.\n  As both the Court and JUSTICE KAGAN point out, we are\na Nation of many religions. Ante, at 10–11; post, at 1–2,\n18. And the Constitution’s Religion Clauses seek to “pro-\ntec[t] the Nation’s social fabric from religious conflict.”\nZelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 717 (2002)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting). The question in this case is\nwhether the prayer practice of the town of Greece, by\ndoing too little to reflect the religious diversity of its citi-\nzens, did too much, even if unintentionally, to promote the\n“political division along religious lines” that “was one of\nthe principal evils against which the First Amendment\nwas intended to protect.” Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S.\n602, 622 (1971).\n  In seeking an answer to that fact-sensitive question, “I\nsee no test-related substitute for the exercise of legal\njudgment.” Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 700 (2005)\n\f6             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). Having applied my\nlegal judgment to the relevant facts, I conclude, like\nJUSTICE KAGAN, that the town of Greece failed to make\nreasonable efforts to include prayer givers of minority\nfaiths, with the result that, although it is a community of\nseveral faiths, its prayer givers were almost exclusively\npersons of a single faith. Under these circumstances, I\nwould affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that\nGreece’s prayer practice violated the Establishment\nClause.\n  I dissent from the Court’s decision to the contrary.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

Our Constitution promises that they\nmay worship in their own way, without fear of penalty or\ndanger, and that in itself is a momentous offering. Yet our\nConstitution makes a commitment still more remarkable—\nthat however those individuals worship, they will count\nas full and equal American citizens. A Christian, a Jew,\na Muslim (and so forth)—each stands in the same re­\nlationship with her country, with her state and local\ncommunities, and with every level and body of govern­\nment. So that when each person performs the duties or\nseeks the benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an\nadherent to one or another religion, but simply as an\nAmerican.\n  I respectfully dissent from the Court’s opinion because I\nthink the Town of Greece’s prayer practices violate that\nnorm of religious equality—the breathtakingly generous\nconstitutional idea that our public institutions belong no\nless to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or\nEpiscopalian. I do not contend that principle translates\nhere into a bright separationist line. To the contrary, I\n\f2             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nagree with the Court’s decision in Marsh v. Chambers, 463\nU. S. 783 (1983), upholding the Nebraska Legislature’s tra­\ndition of beginning each session with a chaplain’s prayer.\nAnd I believe that pluralism and inclusion in a town hall\ncan satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutrality;\nsuch a forum need not become a religion-free zone. But\nstill, the Town of Greece should lose this case. The prac­\ntice at issue here differs from the one sustained in Marsh\nbecause Greece’s town meetings involve participation by\nordinary citizens, and the invocations given—directly to\nthose citizens—were predominantly sectarian in content.\nStill more, Greece’s Board did nothing to recognize reli­\ngious diversity: In arranging for clergy members to open\neach meeting, the Town never sought (except briefly when\nthis suit was filed) to involve, accommodate, or in any way\nreach out to adherents of non-Christian religions. So\nmonth in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped\nin only one faith, addressed toward members of the public,\ncommenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute\ngovernment benefits. In my view, that practice does not\nsquare with the First Amendment’s promise that every\ncitizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in\nher government.\n                              I\n  To begin to see what has gone wrong in the Town of\nGreece, consider several hypothetical scenarios in which\nsectarian prayer—taken straight from this case’s record—\ninfuses governmental activities. None involves, as this\ncase does, a proceeding that could be characterized as a\nlegislative session, but they are useful to elaborate some\ngeneral principles. In each instance, assume (as was true\nin Greece) that the invocation is given pursuant to gov­\nernment policy and is representative of the prayers gener­\nally offered in the designated setting:\n\f              Cite as: 572 U.

The judge bangs his gavel\n  to call the court to order, asks a minister to come to\n  the front of the room, and instructs the 10 or so in­\n  dividuals present to rise for an opening prayer.\n  The clergyman faces those in attendance and says:\n  “Lord, God of all creation, . . . . We acknowledge\n  the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.\n  We draw strength . . . from his resurrection at\n  Easter. Jesus Christ, who took away the sins of the\n  world, destroyed our death, through his dying and\n  in his rising, he has restored our life. Blessed are\n  you, who has raised up the Lord Jesus, you who\n  will raise us, in our turn, and put us by His\n  side. . . . Amen.” App. 88a–89a.

He says: “We pray this [day] for the guid­\n   ance of the Holy Spirit as [we vote] . . . . Let’s just\n   say the Our Father together. ‘Our Father, who art\n   in Heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy King-\n   dom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in\n   Heaven. . . .’ ” Id., at 56a.

The\n       pastor steps to the front of the room, asks everyone\n       to bow their heads, and recites: “[F]ather, son, and\n       Holy Spirit—it is with a due sense of reverence and\n       awe that we come before you [today] seeking your\n       blessing . . . . You are . . . a wise God, oh Lord, . . .\n       as evidenced even in the plan of redemption that is\n       fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

Amen.” Id., at 99a–100a.\n\nI would hold that the government officials responsible for\nthe above practices—that is, for prayer repeatedly invok­\ning a single religion’s beliefs in these settings—crossed a\nconstitutional line. I have every confidence the Court\nwould agree. See ante, at 13 (ALITO, J., concurring). And\neven Greece’s attorney conceded that something like the\nfirst hypothetical (he was not asked about the others)\nwould violate the First Amendment. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n3–4. Why?\n   The reason, of course, has nothing to do with Christian­\nity as such. This opinion is full of Christian prayers, be­\ncause those were the only invocations offered in the Town\nof Greece. But if my hypotheticals involved the prayer of\nsome other religion, the outcome would be exactly the\nsame. Suppose, for example, that government officials in\na predominantly Jewish community asked a rabbi to begin\nall public functions with a chanting of the Sh’ma and\nV’ahavta. (“Hear O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is\nOne. . . . Bind [these words] as a sign upon your hand; let\nthem be a symbol before your eyes; inscribe them on the\ndoorposts of your house, and on your gates.”) Or assume\nofficials in a mostly Muslim town requested a muezzin to\ncommence such functions, over and over again, with a\n\f                   Cite as: 572 U.

I bear wit­\nness that Muhammed is the Messenger of God.”) In any\ninstance, the question would be why such government­\nsponsored prayer of a single religion goes beyond the\nconstitutional pale.\n   One glaring problem is that the government in all these\nhypotheticals has aligned itself with, and placed its im­\nprimatur on, a particular religious creed. “The clearest\ncommand of the Establishment Clause,” this Court has\nheld, “is that one religious denomination cannot be offi-\ncially preferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S.\n228, 244 (1982). Justices have often differed about a\nfurther issue: whether and how the Clause applies to\ngovernmental policies favoring religion (of all kinds) over\nnon-religion. Compare, e.g., McCreary County v. American\nCivil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 860 (2005)\n(“[T]he First Amendment mandates governmental neutral­\nity between . . . religion and nonreligion”), with, e.g., id., at\n885 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Court’s oft repeated\nassertion that the government cannot favor religious\npractice [generally] is false”). But no one has disagreed\nwith this much:\n    “[O]ur constitutional tradition, from the Declaration\n    of Independence and the first inaugural address of\n    Washington . . . down to the present day, has . . . ruled\n    out of order government-sponsored endorsement of re­\n    ligion . . . where the endorsement is sectarian, in the\n    sense of specifying details upon which men and women\n    who believe in a benevolent, omnipotent Creator\n    and Ruler of the world are known to differ (for exam­\n    ple, the divinity of Christ).” Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S.\n    577, 641 (1992) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nSee also County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties\nUnion, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.

They have em-\nbarked on a course of religious favoritism anathema to the\nFirst Amendment.\n  And making matters still worse: They have done so in a\nplace where individuals come to interact with, and partici­\n\n——————\n   1 That principle meant as much to the founders as it does today. The\n\ndemand for neutrality among religions is not a product of 21st century\n“political correctness,” but of the 18th century view—rendered no less\nwise by time—that, in George Washington’s words, “[r]eligious contro­\nversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconciliable\nhatreds than those which spring from any other cause.” Letter to\nEdward Newenham (June 22, 1792), in 10 Papers of George Washing­\nton: Presidential Series 493 (R. Haggard & M. Mastromarino eds. 2002)\n(hereinafter PGW). In an age when almost no one in this country was\nnot a Christian of one kind or another, Washington consistently de­\nclined to use language or imagery associated only with that religion.\nSee Brief for Paul Finkelman et al. as Amici Curiae 15–19 (noting, for\nexample, that in revising his first inaugural address, Washington\ndeleted the phrase “the blessed Religion revealed in the word of God”\nbecause it was understood to denote only Christianity). Thomas\nJefferson, who followed the same practice throughout his life, explained\nthat he omitted any reference to Jesus Christ in Virginia’s Bill for\nEstablishing Religious Freedom (a precursor to the Establishment\nClause) in order “to comprehend, within the mantle of [the law’s]\nprotection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the\nHindoo, and infidel of every denomination.” 1 Writings of Thomas\nJefferson 62 (P. Ford ed. 1892). And James Madison, who again used\nonly nonsectarian language in his writings and addresses, warned that\nreligious proclamations might, “if not strictly guarded,” express only\n“the creed of the majority and a single sect.” Madison’s “Detached\nMemoranda,” 3 Wm. & Mary Quarterly 534, 561 (1946).\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

A person goes to court, to the polls, to a naturaliza­\ntion ceremony—and a government official or his hand­\npicked minister asks her, as the first order of official\nbusiness, to stand and pray with others in a way conflict­\ning with her own religious beliefs. Perhaps she feels suffi-\ncient pressure to go along—to rise, bow her head, and join\nin whatever others are saying: After all, she wants,\nvery badly, what the judge or poll worker or immigration\nofficial has to offer. Or perhaps she is made of stronger\nmettle, and she opts not to participate in what she does not\nbelieve—indeed, what would, for her, be something like\nblasphemy. She then must make known her dissent from\nthe common religious view, and place herself apart from\nother citizens, as well as from the officials responsible for\nthe invocations. And so a civic function of some kind\nbrings religious differences to the fore: That public pro­\nceeding becomes (whether intentionally or not) an instru­\nment for dividing her from adherents to the community’s\nmajority religion, and for altering the very nature of her\nrelationship with her government.\n   That is not the country we are, because that is not what\nour Constitution permits. Here, when a citizen stands\nbefore her government, whether to perform a service or\nrequest a benefit, her religious beliefs do not enter into the\npicture. See Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Act for Establish­\ning Religious Freedom (Oct. 31, 1785), in 5 The Founders’\nConstitution 85 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987)\n(“[O]pinion[s] in matters of religion . . . shall in no wise\ndiminish, enlarge, or affect [our] civil capacities”). The\ngovernment she faces favors no particular religion, either\nby word or by deed. And that government, in its various\nprocesses and proceedings, imposes no religious tests on\nits citizens, sorts none of them by faith, and permits no\nexclusion based on belief.

They all participate in\nthe business of government not as Christians, Jews, Mus­\nlims (and more), but only as Americans—none of them\ndifferent from any other for that civic purpose. Why not,\nthen, at a town meeting?\n                             II\n   In both Greece’s and the majority’s view, everything I\nhave discussed is irrelevant here because this case in­\nvolves “the tradition of legislative prayer outlined” in\nMarsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783. Ante, at 10. And\nbefore I dispute the Town and Court, I want to give them\ntheir due: They are right that, under Marsh, legislative\nprayer has a distinctive constitutional warrant by virtue of\ntradition. As the Court today describes, a long history,\nstretching back to the first session of Congress (when\nchaplains began to give prayers in both Chambers), “ha[s]\nshown that prayer in this limited context could ‘coexis[t]\nwith the principles of disestablishment and religious\nfreedom.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting Marsh, 463 U. S., at 786).\nRelying on that “unbroken” national tradition, Marsh\nupheld (I think correctly) the Nebraska Legislature’s\npractice of opening each day with a chaplain’s prayer as “a\ntolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among\nthe people of this country.” Id., at 792. And so I agree\nwith the majority that the issue here is “whether the\nprayer practice in the Town of Greece fits within the tradi­\ntion long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.”\nAnte, at 9.\n   Where I depart from the majority is in my reply to that\nquestion. The town hall here is a kind of hybrid. Greece’s\nBoard indeed has legislative functions, as Congress and\nstate assemblies do—and that means some opening pray­\ners are allowed there. But much as in my hypotheticals,\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U.

That feature calls for\nBoard members to exercise special care to ensure that the\nprayers offered are inclusive—that they respect each and\nevery member of the community as an equal citizen.2 But\nthe Board, and the clergy members it selected, made no\nsuch effort. Instead, the prayers given in Greece, ad­\ndressed directly to the Town’s citizenry, were more sec­\ntarian, and less inclusive, than anything this Court sus­\ntained in Marsh. For those reasons, the prayer in Greece\ndeparts from the legislative tradition that the majority\ntakes as its benchmark.\n                              A\n  Start by comparing two pictures, drawn precisely from\nreality. The first is of Nebraska’s (unicameral) Legisla­\nture, as this Court and the state senators themselves\ndescribed it. The second is of town council meetings in\nGreece, as revealed in this case’s record.\n  It is morning in Nebraska, and senators are beginning\nto gather in the State’s legislative chamber: It is the be­\nginning of the official workday, although senators may not\nyet need to be on the floor. See Chambers v. Marsh, 504\nF. Supp. 585, 590, and n. 12 (D. Neb. 1980); Lee, 505 U. S.,\nat 597. The chaplain rises to give the daily invocation.\nThat prayer, as the senators emphasized when their case\ncame to this Court, is “directed only at the legislative\n\n——————\n  2 Because  JUSTICE ALITO questions this point, it bears repeating. I do\nnot remotely contend that “prayer is not allowed” at participatory\nmeetings of “local government legislative bodies”; nor is that the\n“logical thrust” of any argument I make. Ante, at 7–8. Rather, what I\nsay throughout this opinion is that in this citizen-centered venue,\ngovernment officials must take steps to ensure—as none of Greece’s\nBoard members ever did—that opening prayers are inclusive of differ­\nent faiths, rather than always identified with a single religion.\n\f10            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmembership, not at the public at large.” Brief for Peti­\ntioners in Marsh 30. Any members of the public who\nhappen to be in attendance—not very many at this early\nhour—watch only from the upstairs visitors’ gallery. See\nApp. 72 in Marsh (senator’s testimony that “as a practical\nmatter the public usually is not there” during the prayer).\n   The longtime chaplain says something like the following\n(the excerpt is from his own amicus brief supporting\nGreece in this case): “O God, who has given all persons\ntalents and varying capacities, Thou dost only require of\nus that we utilize Thy gifts to a maximum. In this Legis­\nlature to which Thou has entrusted special abilities and\nopportunities, may each recognize his stewardship for the\npeople of the State.” Brief for Robert E. Palmer 9. The\nchaplain is a Presbyterian minister, and “some of his\nearlier prayers” explicitly invoked Christian beliefs, but he\n“removed all references to Christ” after a single legislator\ncomplained. Marsh, 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14; Brief for\nPetitioners in Marsh 12. The chaplain also previously\ninvited other clergy members to give the invocation, in­\ncluding local rabbis. See ibid.\n   Now change the channel: It is evening in Greece, New\nYork, and the Supervisor of the Town Board calls its\nmonthly public meeting to order. Those meetings (so says\nthe Board itself) are “the most important part of Town\ngovernment.” See Town of Greece, Town Board, online at\nhttp://greeceny.gov/planning/townboard (as visited May 2,\n2014 and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). They\nserve assorted functions, almost all actively involving\nmembers of the public. The Board may swear in new\nTown employees and hand out awards for civic accom­\nplishments; it always provides an opportunity (called a\nPublic Forum) for citizens to address local issues and ask\nfor improved services or new policies (for example, better\naccommodations for the disabled or actions to ameliorate\ntraffic congestion, see Pl. Exhs. 718, 755, in No. 6:08–cv–\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

But the setting is intimate: There are\nlikely to be only 10 or so citizens in attendance. A few\nmay be children or teenagers, present to receive an award\nor fulfill a high school civics requirement.\n   As the first order of business, the Town Supervisor\nintroduces a local Christian clergy member—denominated\nthe chaplain of the month—to lead the assembled persons\nin prayer. The pastor steps up to a lectern (emblazoned\nwith the Town’s seal) at the front of the dais, and with his\nback to the Town officials, he faces the citizens present.\nHe asks them all to stand and to “pray as we begin this\nevening’s town meeting.” App. 134a. (He does not suggest\nthat anyone should feel free not to participate.) And he\nsays:\n    “The beauties of spring . . . are an expressive symbol\n    of the new life of the risen Christ. The Holy Spirit\n    was sent to the apostles at Pentecost so that they\n    would be courageous witnesses of the Good News to\n    different regions of the Mediterranean world and be­\n    yond. The Holy Spirit continues to be the inspiration\n    and the source of strength and virtue, which we all\n    need in the world of today. And so . . . [w]e pray this\n    evening for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as the\n    Greece Town Board meets.” Ibid.\nAfter the pastor concludes, Town officials behind him\nmake the sign of the cross, as do some members of the\naudience, and everyone says “Amen.” See 681 F. 3d 20, 24\n(CA2 2012). The Supervisor then announces the start of\nthe Public Forum, and a citizen stands up to complain\n\f12            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nabout the Town’s contract with a cable company. See App.\nin No. 10–3635 (CA2), p. A574.\n                             B\n   Let’s count the ways in which these pictures diverge.\nFirst, the governmental proceedings at which the prayers\noccur differ significantly in nature and purpose. The\nNebraska Legislature’s floor sessions—like those of the\nU. S. Congress and other state assemblies—are of, by, and\nfor elected lawmakers. Members of the public take no part\nin those proceedings; any few who attend are spectators\nonly, watching from a high-up visitors’ gallery. (In that\nrespect, note that neither the Nebraska Legislature nor\nthe Congress calls for prayer when citizens themselves\nparticipate in a hearing—say, by giving testimony rele­\nvant to a bill or nomination.) Greece’s town meetings, by\ncontrast, revolve around ordinary members of the commu­\nnity. Each and every aspect of those sessions provides\nopportunities for Town residents to interact with public\nofficials. And the most important parts enable those\ncitizens to petition their government. In the Public Fo­\nrum, they urge (or oppose) changes in the Board’s policies\nand priorities; and then, in what are essentially adjudica­\ntory hearings, they request the Board to grant (or deny)\napplications for various permits, licenses, and zoning\nvariances. So the meetings, both by design and in opera­\ntion, allow citizens to actively participate in the Town’s\ngovernance—sharing concerns, airing grievances, and\nboth shaping the community’s policies and seeking their\nbenefits.\n   Second (and following from what I just said), the pray­\ners in these two settings have different audiences. In the\nNebraska Legislature, the chaplain spoke to, and only to,\nthe elected representatives. Nebraska’s senators were\nadamant on that point in briefing Marsh, and the facts\nfully supported them: As the senators stated, “[t]he activ­\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nity is a matter of internal daily procedure directed only at\nthe legislative membership, not at [members of] the pub­\nlic.” Brief for Petitioners in Marsh 30; see Reply Brief for\nPetitioners in Marsh 8 (“The [prayer] practice involves no\nfunction or power of government vis-à-vis the Nebraska\ncitizenry, but merely concerns an internal decision of the\nNebraska Legislature as to the daily procedure by which it\nconducts its own affairs”). The same is true in the U. S.\nCongress and, I suspect, in every other state legislature.\nSee Brief for Members of Congress as Amici Curiae 6\n(“Consistent with the fact that attending citizens are mere\npassive observers, prayers in the House are delivered for\nthe Representatives themselves, not those citizens”). As\nseveral Justices later noted (and the majority today\nagrees, see ante, at 19–20),3 Marsh involved “government\nofficials invok[ing] spiritual inspiration entirely for their\nown benefit without directing any religious message at the\ncitizens they lead.” Lee, 505 U. S., at 630, n. 8 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   The very opposite is true in Greece: Contrary to the\nmajority’s characterization, see ante, at 19–20, the prayers\nthere are directed squarely at the citizens. Remember\nthat the chaplain of the month stands with his back to the\nTown Board; his real audience is the group he is facing—\nthe 10 or so members of the public, perhaps including\nchildren. See supra, at 10. And he typically addresses\nthose people, as even the majority observes, as though he\nis “directing [his] congregation.” Ante, at 21. He almost\nalways begins with some version of “Let us all pray to­\ngether.” See, e.g., App. 75a, 93a, 106a, 109a. Often, he\ncalls on everyone to stand and bow their heads, and he\n\n——————\n  3 For ease of reference and to avoid confusion, I refer to JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s opinion as “the majority.” But the language I cite that\nappears in Part II–B of that opinion is, in fact, only attributable to a\nplurality of the Court.\n\f14             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmay ask them to recite a common prayer with him. See,\ne.g., id., at 28a, 42a, 43a, 56a, 77a. He refers, constantly,\nto a collective “we”—to “our” savior, for example, to the\npresence of the Holy Spirit in “our” lives, or to “our brother\nthe Lord Jesus Christ.” See, e.g., id., at 32a, 45a, 47a, 69a,\n71a. In essence, the chaplain leads, as the first part of a\ntown meeting, a highly intimate (albeit relatively brief)\nprayer service, with the public serving as his congregation.\n   And third, the prayers themselves differ in their content\nand character. Marsh characterized the prayers in the\nNebraska Legislature as “in the Judeo-Christian tradi­\ntion,” and stated, as a relevant (even if not dispositive)\npart of its analysis, that the chaplain had removed all\nexplicitly Christian references at a senator’s request. 463\nU. S., at 793, n. 14. And as the majority acknowledges,\nsee ante, at 12, Marsh hinged on the view that “that the\nprayer opportunity ha[d] [not] been exploited to proselyt­\nize or advance any one . . . faith or belief ”; had it been\notherwise, the Court would have reached a different deci­\nsion. 463 U. S., at 794–795.\n   But no one can fairly read the prayers from Greece’s\nTown meetings as anything other than explicitly Chris­\ntian—constantly and exclusively so. From the time Greece\nestablished its prayer practice in 1999 until litigation\nloomed nine years later, all of its monthly chaplains were\nChristian clergy. And after a brief spell surrounding the\nfiling of this suit (when a Jewish layman, a Wiccan priest­\ness, and a Baha’i minister appeared at meetings), the\nTown resumed its practice of inviting only clergy from\nneighboring Protestant and Catholic churches. See App.\n129a–143a. About two-thirds of the prayers given over\nthis decade or so invoked “Jesus,” “Christ,” “Your Son,” or\n“the Holy Spirit”; in the 18 months before the record\nclosed, 85% included those references. See generally id.,\nat 27a–143a. Many prayers contained elaborations of\nChristian doctrine or recitations of scripture. See, e.g., id.,\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  15\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nat 129a (“And in the life and death, resurrection and\nascension of the Savior Jesus Christ, the full extent of\nyour kindness shown to the unworthy is forever demon­\nstrated”); id., at 94a (“For unto us a child is born; unto us\na son is given. And the government shall be upon his\nshoulder . . .”). And the prayers usually close with phrases\nlike “in the name of Jesus Christ” or “in the name of Your\nson.” See, e.g., id., at 55a, 65a, 73a, 85a.\n   Still more, the prayers betray no understanding that the\nAmerican community is today, as it long has been, a rich\nmosaic of religious faiths. See Braunfeld v. Brown, 366\nU. S. 599, 606 (1961) (plurality opinion) (recognizing even\nhalf a century ago that “we are a cosmopolitan nation\nmade up of people of almost every conceivable religious\npreference”). The monthly chaplains appear almost al­\nways to assume that everyone in the room is Christian\n(and of a kind who has no objection to government­\nsponsored worship4). The Town itself has never urged its\nchaplains to reach out to members of other faiths, or even\nto recall that they might be present. And accordingly, few\nchaplains have made any effort to be inclusive; none has\nthought even to assure attending members of the public\nthat they need not participate in the prayer session.\nIndeed, as the majority forthrightly recognizes, see ante,\nat 17, when the plaintiffs here began to voice concern over\nprayers that excluded some Town residents, one pastor\npointedly thanked the Board “[o]n behalf of all God-fearing\npeople” for holding fast, and another declared the objectors\n“in the minority and . . . ignorant of the history of our\ncountry.” App. 137a, 108a.\n——————\n  4 Leaders of several Baptist and other Christian congregations have\n\nexplained to the Court that “many Christians believe . . . that their\nfreedom of conscience is violated when they are pressured to participate\nin government prayer, because such acts of worship should only be\nperformed voluntarily.” Brief for Baptist Joint Committee for Religious\nLiberty et al. as Amici Curiae 18.\n\f16            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n                              C\n   Those three differences, taken together, remove this\ncase from the protective ambit of Marsh and the history on\nwhich it relied. To recap: Marsh upheld prayer addressed\nto legislators alone, in a proceeding in which citizens had\nno role—and even then, only when it did not “proselytize\nor advance” any single religion. 463 U. S., at 794. It was\nthat legislative prayer practice (not every prayer in a body\nexercising any legislative function) that the Court found\nconstitutional given its “unambiguous and unbroken\nhistory.” Id., at 792. But that approved practice, as I have\nshown, is not Greece’s. None of the history Marsh cited—\nand none the majority details today—supports calling on\ncitizens to pray, in a manner consonant with only a single\nreligion’s beliefs, at a participatory public proceeding,\nhaving both legislative and adjudicative components. Or\nto use the majority’s phrase, no “history shows that th[is]\nspecific practice is permitted.” Ante, at 8. And so, contra\nthe majority, Greece’s prayers cannot simply ride on the\nconstitutional coattails of the legislative tradition Marsh\ndescribed. The Board’s practice must, in its own particu­\nlars, meet constitutional requirements.\n   And the guideposts for addressing that inquiry include\nthe principles of religious neutrality I discussed earlier.\nSee supra, at 4–8. The government (whether federal,\nstate, or local) may not favor, or align itself with, any\nparticular creed. And that is nowhere more true than\nwhen officials and citizens come face to face in their\nshared institutions of governance. In performing civic\nfunctions and seeking civic benefits, each person of this\nnation must experience a government that belongs to one\nand all, irrespective of belief. And for its part, each gov­\nernment must ensure that its participatory processes will\nnot classify those citizens by faith, or make relevant their\nreligious differences.\n   To decide how Greece fares on that score, think again\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nabout how its prayer practice works, meeting after meet­\ning. The case, I think, has a fair bit in common with my\nearlier hypotheticals. See supra, at 2–4, 7. Let’s say that\na Muslim citizen of Greece goes before the Board to share\nher views on policy or request some permit. Maybe she\nwants the Board to put up a traffic light at a dangerous\nintersection; or maybe she needs a zoning variance to\nbuild an addition on her home. But just before she gets to\nsay her piece, a minister deputized by the Town asks her\nto pray “in the name of God’s only son Jesus Christ.” App.\n99a. She must think—it is hardly paranoia, but only the\ntruth—that Christian worship has become entwined with\nlocal governance. And now she faces a choice—to pray\nalongside the majority as one of that group or somehow to\nregister her deeply felt difference. She is a strong person,\nbut that is no easy call—especially given that the room is\nsmall and her every action (or inaction) will be noticed.\nShe does not wish to be rude to her neighbors, nor does\nshe wish to aggravate the Board members whom she will\nsoon be trying to persuade. And yet she does not want to\nacknowledge Christ’s divinity, any more than many of her\nneighbors would want to deny that tenet. So assume she\ndeclines to participate with the others in the first act of\nthe meeting—or even, as the majority proposes, that she\nstands up and leaves the room altogether, see ante, at 21.\nAt the least, she becomes a different kind of citizen, one\nwho will not join in the religious practice that the Town\nBoard has chosen as reflecting its own and the communi­\nty’s most cherished beliefs. And she thus stands at a\nremove, based solely on religion, from her fellow citizens\nand her elected representatives.\n   Everything about that situation, I think, infringes the\nFirst Amendment. (And of course, as I noted earlier, it\nwould do so no less if the Town’s clergy always used the\nliturgy of some other religion. See supra, at 4–5.) That\nthe Town Board selects, month after month and year after\n\f18            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nyear, prayergivers who will reliably speak in the voice of\nChristianity, and so places itself behind a single creed.\nThat in offering those sectarian prayers, the Board’s cho­\nsen clergy members repeatedly call on individuals, prior to\nparticipating in local governance, to join in a form of wor­\nship that may be at odds with their own beliefs. That the\nclergy thus put some residents to the unenviable choice of\neither pretending to pray like the majority or declining to\njoin its communal activity, at the very moment of petition­\ning their elected leaders. That the practice thus divides\nthe citizenry, creating one class that shares the Board’s\nown evident religious beliefs and another (far smaller)\nclass that does not. And that the practice also alters a\ndissenting citizen’s relationship with her government,\nmaking her religious difference salient when she seeks\nonly to engage her elected representatives as would any\nother citizen.\n   None of this means that Greece’s town hall must be\nreligion- or prayer-free. “[W]e are a religious people,”\nMarsh observed, 463 U. S., at 792, and prayer draws some\nwarrant from tradition in a town hall, as well as in Con­\ngress or a state legislature, see supra, at 8–9. What the\ncircumstances here demand is the recognition that we are\na pluralistic people too. When citizens of all faiths come\nto speak to each other and their elected representatives\nin a legislative session, the government must take espe-\ncial care to ensure that the prayers they hear will seek\nto include, rather than serve to divide. No more is\nrequired—but that much is crucial—to treat every citizen,\nof whatever religion, as an equal participant in her\ngovernment.\n   And contrary to the majority’s (and JUSTICE ALITO’s)\nview, see ante, at 13–14; ante, at 4–7, that is not difficult\nto do. If the Town Board had let its chaplains know that\nthey should speak in nonsectarian terms, common to\ndiverse religious groups, then no one would have valid\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            19\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ngrounds for complaint. See Joyner v. Forsyth County, 653\nF. 3d 341, 347 (CA4 2011) (Wilkinson, J.) (Such prayers\nshow that “those of different creeds are in the end kindred\nspirits, united by a respect paid higher providence and by\na belief in the importance of religious faith”). Priests and\nministers, rabbis and imams give such invocations all the\ntime; there is no great mystery to the project. (And\nproviding that guidance would hardly have caused the\nBoard to run afoul of the idea that “[t]he First Amendment\nis not a majority rule,” as the Court (headspinningly)\nsuggests, ante, at 14; what does that is the Board’s refusal\nto reach out to members of minority religious groups.) Or\nif the Board preferred, it might have invited clergy of\nmany faiths to serve as chaplains, as the majority notes\nthat Congress does. See ante, at 10–11. When one month\na clergy member refers to Jesus, and the next to Allah or\nJehovah—as the majority hopefully though counterfactu­\nally suggests happened here, see ante, at 10–11, 15—the\ngovernment does not identify itself with one religion or\nalign itself with that faith’s citizens, and the effect of even\nsectarian prayer is transformed. So Greece had multiple\nways of incorporating prayer into its town meetings—\nreflecting all the ways that prayer (as most of us know\nfrom daily life) can forge common bonds, rather than\ndivide. See also ante, at 4 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   But Greece could not do what it did: infuse a participa­\ntory government body with one (and only one) faith, so\nthat month in and month out, the citizens appearing\nbefore it become partly defined by their creed—as those\nwho share, and those who do not, the community’s major-\nity religious belief. In this country, when citizens go before\nthe government, they go not as Christians or Muslims or\nJews (or what have you), but just as Americans (or here,\nas Grecians). That is what it means to be an equal citizen,\nirrespective of religion. And that is what the Town of\nGreece precluded by so identifying itself with a single\n\f20            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nfaith.\n                              III\n   How, then, does the majority go so far astray, allowing\nthe Town of Greece to turn its assemblies for citizens into\na forum for Christian prayer? The answer does not lie in\nfirst principles: I have no doubt that every member of this\nCourt believes as firmly as I that our institutions of gov­\nernment belong equally to all, regardless of faith. Rather,\nthe error reflects two kinds of blindness. First, the major-\nity misapprehends the facts of this case, as distinct from\nthose characterizing traditional legislative prayer. And\nsecond, the majority misjudges the essential meaning of\nthe religious worship in Greece’s town hall, along with its\ncapacity to exclude and divide.\n   The facts here matter to the constitutional issue; in-\ndeed, the majority itself acknowledges that the requisite\ninquiry—a “fact-sensitive” one—turns on “the setting in\nwhich the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is\ndirected.” Ante, at 19. But then the majority glides right\nover those considerations—at least as they relate to the\nTown of Greece. When the majority analyzes the “setting”\nand “audience” for prayer, it focuses almost exclusively on\nCongress and the Nebraska Legislature, see ante, at 6–8,\n10–11, 15–16, 19–20; it does not stop to analyze how far\nthose factors differ in Greece’s meetings. The majority\nthus gives short shrift to the gap—more like, the chasm—\nbetween a legislative floor session involving only elected\nofficials and a town hall revolving around ordinary citi­\nzens. And similarly the majority neglects to consider how\nthe prayers in Greece are mostly addressed to members of\nthe public, rather than (as in the forums it discusses) to\nthe lawmakers. “The District Court in Marsh,” the major­\nity expounds, “described the prayer exercise as ‘an inter­\nnal act’ directed at the Nebraska Legislature’s ‘own mem­\nbers.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting Chambers v. Marsh, 504\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nF. Supp., at 588); see ante, at 20 (similarly noting that\nNebraska senators “invoke[d] spiritual inspiration entirely\nfor their own benefit” and that prayer in Congress is “reli­\ngious worship for national representatives” only). Well,\nyes, so it is in Lincoln, and on Capitol Hill. But not in\nGreece, where as I have described, the chaplain faces the\nTown’s residents—with the Board watching from on\nhigh—and calls on them to pray together. See supra, at\n10, 12.\n   And of course—as the majority sidesteps as well—to\npray in the name of Jesus Christ. In addressing the sec­\ntarian content of these prayers, the majority again chang­\nes the subject, preferring to explain what happens in other\ngovernment bodies. The majority notes, for example, that\nCongress “welcom[es] ministers of many creeds,” who\ncommonly speak of “values that count as universal,” ante,\nat 11, 15; and in that context, the majority opines, the fact\n“[t]hat a prayer is given in the name of Jesus, Allah, or\nJehovah . . . does not remove it from” Marsh’s protection,\nsee ante, at 15. But that case is not this one, as I have\nshown, because in Greece only Christian clergy members\nspeak, and then mostly in the voice of their own religion;\nno Allah or Jehovah ever is mentioned. See supra, at 13–\n14. So all the majority can point to in the Town’s practice\nis that the Board “maintains a policy of nondiscrimina­\ntion,” and “represent[s] that it would welcome a prayer by\nany minister or layman who wishe[s] to give one.” Ante, at\n17–18. But that representation has never been publicized;\nnor has the Board (except for a few months surrounding\nthis suit’s filing) offered the chaplain’s role to any non-\nChristian clergy or layman, in either Greece or its envi­\nrons; nor has the Board ever provided its chaplains with\nguidance about reaching out to members of other faiths, as\nmost state legislatures and Congress do. See 732 F. Supp.\n2d 195, 197–203 (WDNY 2010); National Conference of\nState Legislatures, Inside the Legislative Process: Prayer\n\f22                TOWN OF GREECE v.

The majority thus errs in assimilating\nthe Board’s prayer practice to that of Congress or the Ne-\nbraska Legislature. Unlike those models, the Board is\ndeterminedly—and relentlessly—noninclusive.5\n   And the month in, month out sectarianism the Board\nchose for its meetings belies the majority’s refrain that the\nprayers in Greece were “ceremonial” in nature.

Ceremonial references to the divine surely\nabound: The majority is right that “the Pledge of Alle­\ngiance, inaugural prayer, or the recitation of ‘God save the\nUnited States and this honorable Court’ ” each fits the bill.\nAnte, at 19. But prayers evoking “the saving sacrifice of\nJesus Christ on the cross,” “the plan of redemption that is\nfulfilled in Jesus Christ,” “the life and death, resurrection\nand ascension of the Savior Jesus Christ,” the workings of\nthe Holy Spirit, the events of Pentecost, and the belief that\nGod “has raised up the Lord Jesus” and “will raise us, in\nour turn, and put us by His side”? See App. 56a, 88a–89a,\n99a, 123a, 129a, 134a. No. These are statements of pro­\nfound belief and deep meaning, subscribed to by many,\ndenied by some. They “speak of the depths of [one’s] life,\nof the source of [one’s] being, of [one’s] ultimate concern, of\nwhat [one] take[s] seriously without any reservation.” P.\n——————\n   5 JUSTICE ALITO similarly falters in attempting to excuse the Town\n\nBoard’s constant sectarianism. His concurring opinion takes great\npains to show that the problem arose from a sort of bureaucratic glitch:\nThe Town’s clerks, he writes, merely “did a bad job in compiling the\nlist” of chaplains. Ante, at 6; see ante, at 1–3. Now I suppose one\nquestion that account raises is why in over a decade, no member of the\nBoard noticed that the clerk’s list was producing prayers of only one\nkind. But put that aside. Honest oversight or not, the problem re­\nmains: Every month for more than a decade, the Board aligned itself,\nthrough its prayer practices, with a single religion. That the concurring\nopinion thinks my objection to that is “really quite niggling,” ante, at 4,\nsays all there is to say about the difference between our respective\nviews.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

If they\n(and the central tenets of other religions) ever become\nmere ceremony, this country will be a fundamentally\ndifferent—and, I think, poorer—place to live.\n   But just for that reason, the not-so-implicit message of\nthe majority’s opinion—“What’s the big deal, anyway?”—is\nmistaken. The content of Greece’s prayers is a big deal, to\nChristians and non-Christians alike. A person’s response\nto the doctrine, language, and imagery contained in those\ninvocations reveals a core aspect of identity—who that\nperson is and how she faces the world. And the responses\nof different individuals, in Greece and across this country,\nof course vary. Contrary to the majority’s apparent view,\nsuch sectarian prayers are not “part of our expressive\nidiom” or “part of our heritage and tradition,” assuming\nthe word “our” refers to all Americans. Ante, at 19. They\nexpress beliefs that are fundamental to some, foreign to\nothers—and because that is so they carry the ever-present\npotential to both exclude and divide. The majority, I\nthink, assesses too lightly the significance of these reli­\ngious differences, and so fears too little the “religiously\nbased divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to\navoid.” Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 704 (2005)\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). I would treat more\nseriously the multiplicity of Americans’ religious commit­\nments, along with the challenge they can pose to the\nproject—the distinctively American project—of creating\none from the many, and governing all as united.\n                              IV\n  In 1790, George Washington traveled to Newport, Rhode\nIsland, a longtime bastion of religious liberty and the\nhome of one of the first communities of American Jews. Among\nthe citizens he met there was Moses Seixas, one of that\ncongregation’s lay officials. The ensuing exchange be­\ntween the two conveys, as well as anything I know, the\n\f24             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\npromise this country makes to members of every religion.\n   Seixas wrote first, welcoming Washington to Newport.\nHe spoke of “a deep sense of gratitude” for the new Ameri­\ncan Government—“a Government, which to bigotry gives\nno sanction, to persecution no assistance—but generously\naffording to All liberty of conscience, and immunities of\nCitizenship: deeming every one, of whatever Nation,\ntongue, or language, equal parts of the great governmental\nMachine.” Address from Newport Hebrew Congregation\n(Aug. 17, 1790), in 6 PGW 286, n. 1 (M. Mastromarino ed.\n1996). The first phrase there is the more poetic: a gov­\nernment that to “bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution\nno assistance.” But the second is actually the more star­\ntling and transformative: a government that, beyond not\naiding persecution, grants “immunities of citizenship” to\nthe Christian and the Jew alike, and makes them “equal\nparts” of the whole country.\n   Washington responded the very next day. Like any\nsuccessful politician, he appreciated a great line when he\nsaw one—and knew to borrow it too. And so he repeated,\nword for word, Seixas’s phrase about neither sanctioning\nbigotry nor assisting persecution. But he no less embraced\nthe point Seixas had made about equality of citizenship.\n“It is now no more,” Washington said, “that toleration is\nspoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of\npeople” to another, lesser one. For “[a]ll possess alike . . .\nimmunities of citizenship.” Letter to Newport Hebrew\nCongregation (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 PGW 285. That is\nAmerica’s promise in the First Amendment: full and equal\nmembership in the polity for members of every religious\ngroup, assuming only that they, like anyone “who live[s]\nunder [the Government’s] protection[,] should demean\nthemselves as good citizens.” Ibid.\n   For me, that remarkable guarantee means at least this\nmuch: When the citizens of this country approach their\ngovernment, they do so only as Americans, not as mem­\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

And that means that even\nin a partly legislative body, they should not confront\ngovernment-sponsored worship that divides them along\nreligious lines. I believe, for all the reasons I have given,\nthat the Town of Greece betrayed that promise. I there­\nfore respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision.\n\f",

GALLOWAY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12–696.      Argued November 6, 2013—Decided May 5, 2014\nSince 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York,\n  have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance,\n  and a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in\n  a local directory. While the prayer program is open to all creeds,\n  nearly all of the local congregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of\n  the participating prayer givers have been too. Respondents, citizens\n  who attend meetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that\n  the town violated the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by\n  preferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sec-\n  tarian prayers. They sought to limit the town to “inclusive and ecu-\n  menical” prayers that referred only to a “generic God.” The District\n  Court upheld the prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no\n  impermissible preference for Christianity; concluding that the Chris-\n  tian identity of most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly\n  Christian character of the town’s congregations, not an official policy\n  or practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that the\n  First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from con-\n  gregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity; and re-\n  jecting the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian. The\n  Second Circuit reversed, holding that some aspects of the prayer pro-\n  gram, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the\n  message that Greece was endorsing Christianity.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"800030\"><a href=\"/opinion/800030/galloway-v-town-of-greece/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, reversed.\n    JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part II–B, concluding that the town’s prayer practice does not violate\n  the Establishment Clause.

In Marsh, the Court concluded that it\n    was not necessary to define the Establishment Clause’s precise\n    boundary in order to uphold Nebraska’s practice of employing a legis-\n    lative chaplain because history supported the conclusion that the\n    specific practice was permitted. The First Congress voted to appoint\n    and pay official chaplains shortly after approving language for the\n    First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained the office virtu-\n    ally uninterrupted since then. See id., at 787–789, and n. 10. A ma-\n    jority of the States have also had a consistent practice of legislative\n    prayer. Id., at 788–790, and n. 11. There is historical precedent for\n    the practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as well.\n    Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted\n    “by reference to historical practices and understandings.” County of\n    Allegheny v.

Thus, any test\n    must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and\n    has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change. The\n    Court’s inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer prac-\n    tice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in\n    Congress and the state legislatures. Pp. 6–9.\n       (b) Respondents’ insistence on nonsectarian prayer is not con-\n    sistent with this tradition. The prayers in Marsh were consistent\n    with the First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic\n    theism but because the Nation’s history and tradition have shown\n    that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t] with the principles\n    of disestablishment and religious freedom.” 463 U. S., at 786. Dic-\n    tum in County of Allegheny suggesting that Marsh permitted only\n    prayer with no overtly Christian references is irreconcilable with the\n    facts, holding, and reasoning of Marsh, which instructed that the\n    “content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided “there is\n    no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to prose-\n    lytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.”\n    463 U. S., at 794–795. To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian\n    would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts decid-\n    ing these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,\n    thus involving government in religious matters to a far greater de-\n    gree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither ed-\n    iting nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content\n    after the fact. Respondents’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive.\n    It is doubtful that consensus could be reached as to what qualifies as\n    a generic or nonsectarian prayer. It would also be unwise to conclude\n    that only those religious words acceptable to the majority are permis-\n\f                   Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsible, for the First Amendment is not a majority rule and government\nmay not seek to define permissible categories of religious speech. In\nrejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian,\nthe Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content.\nThe relevant constraint derives from the prayer’s place at the open-\ning of legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the oc-\ncasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. From the\nNation’s earliest days, invocations have been addressed to assemblies\ncomprising many different creeds, striving for the idea that people of\nmany faiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion,\neven if they disagree as to religious doctrine. The prayers delivered\nin Greece do not fall outside this tradition. They may have invoked,\ne.g., the name of Jesus, but they also invoked universal themes, e.g.,\nby calling for a “spirit of cooperation.” Absent a pattern of prayers\nthat over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible gov-\nernment purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a par-\nticular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation. See\n463 U. S., at 794–795. Finally, so long as the town maintains a policy\nof nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search\nbeyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to\nachieve religious balancing. Pp. 9–18.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,\nconcluded in Part II–B that a fact-sensitive inquiry that considers\nboth the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom\nit is directed shows that the town is not coercing its citizens to engage\nin a religious observance. The prayer opportunity is evaluated\nagainst the backdrop of a historical practice showing that prayer has\nbecome part of the Nation’s heritage and tradition. It is presumed\nthat the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and\nunderstands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceed-\nings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many\nprivate citizens. Furthermore, the principal audience for these invo-\ncations is not the public, but the lawmakers themselves. And those\nlawmakers did not direct the public to participate, single out dissi-\ndents for opprobrium, or indicate that their decisions might be influ-\nenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity. Re-\nspondents claim that the prayers gave them offense and made them\nfeel excluded and disrespected, but offense does not equate to coer-\ncion. In contrast to Lee v.

Pp. 18–23.\n      JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA as to Part II, agreed\n    that the town’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment\n    Clause, but concluded that, even if the Establishment Clause were\n    properly incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth\n    Amendment, the Clause is not violated by the kind of subtle pres-\n    sures respondents allegedly suffered, which do not amount to actual\n    legal coercion. The municipal prayers in this case bear no resem-\n    blance to the coercive state establishments that existed at the found-\n    ing, which exercised government power in order to exact financial\n    support of the church, compel religious observance, or control reli-\n    gious doctrine.

The prayer was intended to place town board\nmembers in a solemn and deliberative frame of mind,\ninvoke divine guidance in town affairs, and follow a tradi­\ntion practiced by Congress and dozens of state legisla­\ntures. App. 22a–25a.\n   The town followed an informal method for selecting\nprayer givers, all of whom were unpaid volunteers. A\ntown employee would call the congregations listed in a\nlocal directory until she found a minister available for that\nmonth’s meeting. The town eventually compiled a list of\nwilling “board chaplains” who had accepted invitations\nand agreed to return in the future. The town at no point\nexcluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer\ngiver. Its leaders maintained that a minister or layperson\nof any persuasion, including an atheist, could give the\ninvocation. But nearly all of the congregations in town\nwere Christian; and from 1999 to 2007, all of the partici­\npating ministers were too.\n   Greece neither reviewed the prayers in advance of the\nmeetings nor provided guidance as to their tone or con­\ntent, in the belief that exercising any degree of control\nover the prayers would infringe both the free exercise and\nspeech rights of the ministers.

We ask this in the name\n    of our brother Jesus. Amen.” Id., at 45a.\nSome of the ministers spoke in a distinctly Christian\nidiom; and a minority invoked religious holidays, scrip­\nture, or doctrine, as in the following prayer:\n    “Lord, God of all creation, we give you thanks and\n    praise for your presence and action in the world. We\n    look with anticipation to the celebration of Holy Week\n    and Easter. It is in the solemn events of next week\n    that we find the very heart and center of our Chris­\n    tian faith.

They did not seek an end to\nthe prayer practice, but rather requested an injunction\nthat would limit the town to “inclusive and ecumenical”\nprayers that referred only to a “generic God” and would\nnot associate the government with any one faith or belief.\nId., at 210, 241.\n   The District Court on summary judgment upheld the\nprayer practice as consistent with the First Amendment.\nIt found no impermissible preference for Christianity,\nnoting that the town had opened the prayer program to all\ncreeds and excluded none. Although most of the prayer\ngivers were Christian, this fact reflected only the predom­\ninantly Christian identity of the town’s congregations,\nrather than an official policy or practice of discriminating\nagainst minority faiths. The District Court found no\nauthority for the proposition that the First Amendment\nrequired Greece to invite clergy from congregations be­\nyond its borders in order to achieve a minimum level of\nreligious diversity.\n   The District Court also rejected the theory that legisla­\ntive prayer must be nonsectarian. The court began its\ninquiry with the opinion in Marsh v.

With respect to the prayer in Greece, the Dis­\ntrict Court concluded that references to Jesus, and the\noccasional request that the audience stand for the prayer,\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not amount to impermissible proselytizing. It located\nin Marsh no additional requirement that the prayers be\npurged of sectarian content. In this regard the court\nquoted recent invocations offered in the U. S. House of\nRepresentatives “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,”\ne.g., 156 Cong Rec. H5205 (June 30, 2010), and situated\nprayer in this context as part a long tradition. Finally, the\ntrial court noted this Court’s statement in County of Alle-\ngheny v.

By\nwelcoming many viewpoints, the District Court concluded,\nthe town would be unlikely to give the impression that it\nwas affiliating itself with any one religion.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"800030\"><a href=\"/opinion/800030/galloway-v-town-of-greece/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (2012). It held that some aspects of the\nprayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable\nobserver, conveyed the message that Greece was endors­\ning Christianity. The town’s failure to promote the prayer\nopportunity to the public, or to invite ministers from con­\ngregations outside the town limits, all but “ensured a\nChristian viewpoint.” Id., at 30–31. Although the court\nfound no inherent problem in the sectarian content of the\nprayers, it concluded that the “steady drumbeat” of Chris­\ntian prayer, unbroken by invocations from other faith\ntraditions, tended to affiliate the town with Christianity.\nId., at 32. Finally, the court found it relevant that guest\nclergy sometimes spoke on behalf of all present at the\nmeeting, as by saying “let us pray,” or by asking audience\nmembers to stand and bow their heads: “The invitation . . .\nto participate in the prayer . . . placed audience members\n\f6             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwho are nonreligious or adherents of non-Christian reli­\ngion in the awkward position of either participating in\nprayers invoking beliefs they did not share or appearing to\nshow disrespect for the invocation.” Ibid. That board\nmembers bowed their heads or made the sign of the cross\nfurther conveyed the message that the town endorsed\nChristianity. The Court of Appeals emphasized that it\nwas the “interaction of the facts present in this case,”\nrather than any single element, that rendered the prayer\nunconstitutional. Id., at 33.\n  Having granted certiorari to decide whether the town’s\nprayer practice violates the Establishment Clause, 569\nU. S. ___ (2013), the Court now reverses the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n                              II\n   In Marsh v.

The decision\nconcluded that legislative prayer, while religious in na­\nture, has long been understood as compatible with the\nEstablishment Clause. As practiced by Congress since the\nframing of the Constitution, legislative prayer lends grav-\nity to public business, reminds lawmakers to transcend\npetty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and ex­\npresses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful soci-\nety. See Lynch v. Donnelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693 (1984)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring); cf. A. Adams & C. Emmerich, A\nNation Dedicated to Religious Liberty 83 (1990). The\nCourt has considered this symbolic expression to be a\n“tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held,” Marsh,\n463 U. S., at 792, rather than a first, treacherous step\ntowards establishment of a state church.\n   Marsh is sometimes described as “carving out an excep­\ntion” to the Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence,\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause it sustained legislative prayer without subjecting\nthe practice to “any of the formal ‘tests’ that have tradi­\ntionally structured” this inquiry. Id., at 796, 813 (Bren­\nnan, J., dissenting). The Court in Marsh found those tests\nunnecessary because history supported the conclusion that\nlegislative invocations are compatible with the Establish­\nment Clause. The First Congress made it an early item of\nbusiness to appoint and pay official chaplains, and both\nthe House and Senate have maintained the office virtually\nuninterrupted since that time. See id., at 787–789, and\nn. 10; N. Feldman, Divided by God 109 (2005). But see\nMarsh, supra, at 791–792, and n. 12 (noting dissenting\nviews among the Framers); Madison, “Detached Memo­\nranda”, 3 Wm. & Mary Quarterly 534, 558–559 (1946)\n(hereinafter Madison’s Detached Memoranda).           When\nMarsh was decided, in 1983, legislative prayer had per­\nsisted in the Nebraska Legislature for more than a cen-\ntury, and the majority of the other States also had the\nsame, consistent practice. 463 U. S., at 788–790, and n. 11.\nAlthough no information has been cited by the parties to\nindicate how many local legislative bodies open their\nmeetings with prayer, this practice too has historical\nprecedent. See Reports of Proceedings of the City Council\nof Boston for the Year Commencing Jan. 1, 1909, and\nEnding Feb. 5, 1910, pp. 1–2 (1910) (Rev. Arthur Little)\n(“And now we desire to invoke Thy presence, Thy blessing,\nand Thy guidance upon those who are gathered here this\nmorning . . .”). “In light of the unambiguous and unbroken\nhistory of more than 200 years, there can be no doubt that\nthe practice of opening legislative sessions with a prayer\nhas become part of the fabric of our society.” Marsh,\nsupra, at 792.\n   Yet Marsh must not be understood as permitting a\npractice that would amount to a constitutional violation if\nnot for its historical foundation. The case teaches instead\nthat the Establishment Clause must be interpreted “by\n\f8             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreference to historical practices and understandings.”\nCounty of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 670 (KENNEDY, J., con­\ncurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). That\nthe First Congress provided for the appointment of chap­\nlains only days after approving language for the First\nAmendment demonstrates that the Framers considered\nlegislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion’s\nrole in society. D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress:\nThe Federalist Period 1789–1801, pp. 12–13 (1997). In the\n1850’s, the judiciary committees in both the House and\nSenate reevaluated the practice of official chaplaincies\nafter receiving petitions to abolish the office. The commit­\ntees concluded that the office posed no threat of an estab­\nlishment because lawmakers were not compelled to attend\nthe daily prayer, S. Rep. No. 376, 32d Cong., 2d Sess., 2\n(1853); no faith was excluded by law, nor any favored, id.,\nat 3; and the cost of the chaplain’s salary imposed a van­\nishingly small burden on taxpayers, H. Rep. No. 124, 33d\nCong., 1st Sess., 6 (1854). Marsh stands for the proposi­\ntion that it is not necessary to define the precise boundary\nof the Establishment Clause where history shows that the\nspecific practice is permitted. Any test the Court adopts\nmust acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the\nFramers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time\nand political change.

Respondents assert that the town’s prayer exercise\nfalls outside that tradition and transgresses the Estab­\nlishment Clause for two independent but mutually rein­\nforcing reasons. First, they argue that Marsh did not\napprove prayers containing sectarian language or themes,\nsuch as the prayers offered in Greece that referred to the\n“death, resurrection, and ascension of the Savior Jesus\nChrist,” App. 129a, and the “saving sacrifice of Jesus\nChrist on the cross,” id., at 88a. Second, they argue that\nthe setting and conduct of the town board meetings create\nsocial pressures that force nonadherents to remain in the\nroom or even feign participation in order to avoid offend­\ning the representatives who sponsor the prayer and will\nvote on matters citizens bring before the board. The sec­\ntarian content of the prayers compounds the subtle coer­\ncive pressures, they argue, because the nonbeliever who\nmight tolerate ecumenical prayer is forced to do the same\nfor prayer that might be inimical to his or her beliefs.\n                              A\n   Respondents maintain that prayer must be nonsectarian,\nor not identifiable with any one religion; and they fault\nthe town for permitting guest chaplains to deliver prayers\nthat “use overtly Christian terms” or “invoke specifics of\nChristian theology.” Brief for Respondents 20. A prayer is\nfitting for the public sphere, in their view, only if it con­\ntains the ‘ “most general, nonsectarian reference to God,’ ”\nid., at 33 (quoting M. Meyerson, Endowed by Our Creator:\nThe Birth of Religious Freedom in America 11–12 (2012)),\nand eschews mention of doctrines associated with any one\nfaith, Brief for Respondents 32–33. They argue that prayer\nwhich contemplates “the workings of the Holy Spirit, the\nevents of Pentecost, and the belief that God ‘has raised\n\f10            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nup the Lord Jesus’ and ‘will raise us, in our turn, and put\nus by His side’ ” would be impermissible, as would any\nprayer that reflects dogma particular to a single faith\ntradition. Id., at 34 (quoting App. 89a and citing id., at\n56a, 123a, 134a).\n   An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a\nsingle, fixed standard is not consistent with the tradition\nof legislative prayer outlined in the Court’s cases. The\nCourt found the prayers in Marsh consistent with the\nFirst Amendment not because they espoused only a ge-\nneric theism but because our history and tradition have\nshown that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t]\nwith the principles of disestablishment and religious\nfreedom.” 463 U. S., at 786. The Congress that drafted\nthe First Amendment would have been accustomed to\ninvocations containing explicitly religious themes of the\nsort respondents find objectionable. One of the Senate’s\nfirst chaplains, the Rev. William White, gave prayers in a\nseries that included the Lord’s Prayer, the Collect for\nAsh Wednesday, prayers for peace and grace, a general\nthanksgiving, St. Chrysostom’s Prayer, and a prayer\nseeking “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, &c.” Letter\nfrom W. White to H. Jones (Dec. 29, 1830), in B. Wilson,\nMemoir of the Life of the Right Reverend William White,\nD. D., Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the\nState of Pennsylvania 322 (1839); see also New Hampshire\nPatriot & State Gazette, Dec. 15, 1823, p. 1 (describing a\nSenate prayer addressing the “Throne of Grace”); Cong.\nGlobe, 37th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1861) (reciting the Lord’s\nPrayer). The decidedly Christian nature of these prayers\nmust not be dismissed as the relic of a time when our\nNation was less pluralistic than it is today. Congress\ncontinues to permit its appointed and visiting chaplains to\nexpress themselves in a religious idiom. It acknowledges\nour growing diversity not by proscribing sectarian content\nbut by welcoming ministers of many creeds. See, e.g., 160\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

There the Court held that\na crèche placed on the steps of a county courthouse to\ncelebrate the Christmas season violated the Establish­\nment Clause because it had “the effect of endorsing a\npatently Christian message.” Id., at 601. Four dissenting\nJustices disputed that endorsement could be the proper\ntest, as it likely would condemn a host of traditional prac­\ntices that recognize the role religion plays in our society,\namong them legislative prayer and the “forthrightly reli­\ngious” Thanksgiving proclamations issued by nearly every\nPresident since Washington. Id., at 670–671. The Court\nsought to counter this criticism by recasting Marsh to\npermit only prayer that contained no overtly Christian\nreferences:\n    “However history may affect the constitutionality of\n    nonsectarian references to religion by the government,\n    history cannot legitimate practices that demonstrate\n    the government’s allegiance to a particular sect or\n    creed . . . . The legislative prayers involved in Marsh\n    did not violate this principle because the particular\n\f12             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     chaplain had ‘removed all references to Christ.’ ” Id.,\n     at 603 (quoting Marsh, supra, at 793, n. 14; footnote\n     omitted).\n  This proposition is irreconcilable with the facts of Marsh\nand with its holding and reasoning. Marsh nowhere sug­\ngested that the constitutionality of legislative prayer turns\non the neutrality of its content. The opinion noted that\nNebraska’s chaplain, the Rev. Robert E. Palmer, modu-\nlated the “explicitly Christian” nature of his prayer and\n“removed all references to Christ” after a Jewish law­\nmaker complained. 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14. With this foot­\nnote, the Court did no more than observe the practical\ndemands placed on a minister who holds a permanent,\nappointed position in a legislature and chooses to write his\nor her prayers to appeal to more members, or at least to\ngive less offense to those who object. See Mallory, “An\nOfficer of the House Which Chooses Him, and Nothing\nMore”: How Should Marsh v. Chambers Apply to Rotating\nChaplains?, 73 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1421, 1445 (2006). Marsh\ndid not suggest that Nebraska’s prayer practice would\nhave failed had the chaplain not acceded to the legislator’s\nrequest. Nor did the Court imply the rule that prayer\nviolates the Establishment Clause any time it is given in\nthe name of a figure deified by only one faith or creed. See\nVan Orden, 545 U. S., at 688, n. 8 (recognizing that the\nprayers in Marsh were “often explicitly Christian” and\nrejecting the view that this gave rise to an establishment\nviolation). To the contrary, the Court instructed that the\n“content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided\n“there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has\nbeen exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to\ndisparage any other, faith or belief.” 463 U. S., at 794–\n795.\n  To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would\nforce the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

It would be but a few steps removed\nfrom that prohibition for legislatures to require chaplains\nto redact the religious content from their message in order\nto make it acceptable for the public sphere.

The difficulty, indeed the futility, of sifting sectarian\nfrom nonsectarian speech is illustrated by a letter that\na lawyer for the respondents sent the town in the early\nstages of this litigation.

Perhaps the writer believed the former group­\ning would be acceptable to monotheists. Yet even seem­\ningly general references to God or the Father might alien­\nate nonbelievers or polytheists.

Because it is unlikely that\nprayer will be inclusive beyond dispute, it would be un­\nwise to adopt what respondents think is the next-best\noption: permitting those religious words, and only those\nwords, that are acceptable to the majority, even if they\nwill exclude some.

The First Amendment is not a majority rule, and\ngovernment may not seek to define permissible categories\nof religious speech. Once it invites prayer into the public\nsphere, government must permit a prayer giver to address\nhis or her own God or gods as conscience dictates, unfet­\ntered by what an administrator or judge considers to be\nnonsectarian.\n   In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must\nbe nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no con­\nstraints remain on its content. The relevant constraint\nderives from its place at the opening of legislative ses­\nsions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and\nreflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. Prayer\nthat is solemn and respectful in tone, that invites law­\nmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends\nbefore they embark on the fractious business of governing,\nserves that legitimate function. If the course and practice\nover time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbeliev­\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ners or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach\nconversion, many present may consider the prayer to fall\nshort of the desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion\nand to unite lawmakers in their common effort. That\ncircumstance would present a different case than the one\npresently before the Court.\n   The tradition reflected in Marsh permits chaplains to\nask their own God for blessings of peace, justice, and\nfreedom that find appreciation among people of all faiths.\nThat a prayer is given in the name of Jesus, Allah, or\nJehovah, or that it makes passing reference to religious\ndoctrines, does not remove it from that tradition. These\nreligious themes provide particular means to universal\nends. Prayer that reflects beliefs specific to only some\ncreeds can still serve to solemnize the occasion, so long as\nthe practice over time is not “exploited to proselytize or\nadvance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or be­\nlief.” Marsh, 463 U. S., at 794–795.\n   It is thus possible to discern in the prayers offered to\nCongress a commonality of theme and tone. While these\nprayers vary in their degree of religiosity, they often seek\npeace for the Nation, wisdom for its lawmakers, and jus­\ntice for its people, values that count as universal and that\nare embodied not only in religious traditions, but in our\nfounding documents and laws. The first prayer delivered\nto the Continental Congress by the Rev. Jacob Duché on\nSept. 7, 1774, provides an example:\n      “Be Thou present O God of Wisdom and direct the\n    counsel of this Honorable Assembly; enable them to\n    settle all things on the best and surest foundations;\n    that the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that\n    Order, Harmony, and Peace be effectually restored,\n    and the Truth and Justice, Religion and Piety, prevail\n    and flourish among the people.\n      “Preserve the health of their bodies, and the vigor of\n\f16            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     their minds, shower down on them, and the millions\n     they here represent, such temporal Blessings as Thou\n     seest expedient for them in this world, and crown\n     them with everlasting Glory in the world to come. All\n     this we ask in the name and through the merits of\n     Jesus Christ, Thy Son and our Saviour, Amen.” W.\n     Federer, America’s God and Country 137 (2000).\n   From the earliest days of the Nation, these invocations\nhave been addressed to assemblies comprising many\ndifferent creeds. These ceremonial prayers strive for the\nidea that people of many faiths may be united in a com­\nmunity of tolerance and devotion. Even those who dis-\nagree as to religious doctrine may find common ground in\nthe desire to show respect for the divine in all aspects of\ntheir lives and being. Our tradition assumes that adult\ncitizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and per­\nhaps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person\nof a different faith. See Letter from John Adams to Abi­\ngail Adams (Sept. 16, 1774), in C. Adams, Familiar Letters\nof John Adams and His Wife Abigail Adams, During the\nRevolution 37–38 (1876).\n   The prayers delivered in the town of Greece do not fall\noutside the tradition this Court has recognized. A number\nof the prayers did invoke the name of Jesus, the Heavenly\nFather, or the Holy Spirit, but they also invoked universal\nthemes, as by celebrating the changing of the seasons or\ncalling for a “spirit of cooperation” among town leaders.\nApp. 31a, 38a. Among numerous examples of such prayer\nin the record is the invocation given by the Rev. Richard\nBarbour at the September 2006 board meeting:\n     “Gracious God, you have richly blessed our nation\n     and this community. Help us to remember your gen­\n     erosity and give thanks for your goodness. Bless the\n     elected leaders of the Greece Town Board as they con­\n     duct the business of our town this evening.

We ask your bless­\n    ing on all public servants, and especially on our police\n    force, firefighters, and emergency medical person­\n    nel. . . . Respectful of every religious tradition, I offer\n    this prayer in the name of God’s only son Jesus\n    Christ, the Lord, Amen.” Id., at 98a–99a.\n   Respondents point to other invocations that disparaged\nthose who did not accept the town’s prayer practice. One\nguest minister characterized objectors as a “minority” who\nare “ignorant of the history of our country,” id., at 108a,\nwhile another lamented that other towns did not have\n“God-fearing” leaders, id., at 79a. Although these two\nremarks strayed from the rationale set out in Marsh, they\ndo not despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and\nembraces our tradition. Absent a pattern of prayers that\nover time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissi­\nble government purpose, a challenge based solely on the\ncontent of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional\nviolation. Marsh, indeed, requires an inquiry into the\nprayer opportunity as a whole, rather than into the con­\ntents of a single prayer. 463 U. S., at 794–795.\n   Finally, the Court disagrees with the view taken by the\nCourt of Appeals that the town of Greece contravened the\nEstablishment Clause by inviting a predominantly Chris­\ntian set of ministers to lead the prayer. The town made\nreasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations\nlocated within its borders and represented that it would\nwelcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished\nto give one. That nearly all of the congregations in town\nturned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or\nbias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths.\nSo long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimina­\ntion, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond\nits borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to\n\f18            TOWN OF GREECE v.

The quest to promote “a\n‘diversity’ of religious views” would require the town “to\nmake wholly inappropriate judgments about the number\nof religions [it] should sponsor and the relative frequency\nwith which it should sponsor each,” Lee, 505 U. S., at 617\n(Souter, J., concurring), a form of government entangle­\nment with religion that is far more troublesome than the\ncurrent approach.\n                             B\n  Respondents further seek to distinguish the town’s\nprayer practice from the tradition upheld in Marsh on the\nground that it coerces participation by nonadherents.\nThey and some amici contend that prayer conducted in the\nintimate setting of a town board meeting differs in funda­\nmental ways from the invocations delivered in Congress\nand state legislatures, where the public remains segregated\nfrom legislative activity and may not address the body\nexcept by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town\nmeetings, on the other hand, to accept awards; speak on\nmatters of local importance; and petition the board for\naction that may affect their economic interests, such as\nthe granting of permits, business licenses, and zoning\nvariances. Respondents argue that the public may feel\nsubtle pressure to participate in prayers that violate their\nbeliefs in order to please the board members from whom\nthey are about to seek a favorable ruling. In their view\nthe fact that board members in small towns know many of\ntheir constituents by name only increases the pressure to\nconform.\n  It is an elemental First Amendment principle that\ngovernment may not coerce its citizens “to support or\nparticipate in any religion or its exercise.” County of\nAllegheny, 492 U. S., at 659 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); see also Van\nOrden, 545 U. S., at 683 (plurality opinion) (recognizing\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

On the record in this case the Court\nis not persuaded that the town of Greece, through the act\nof offering a brief, solemn, and respectful prayer to open\nits monthly meetings, compelled its citizens to engage in a\nreligious observance. The inquiry remains a fact-sensitive\none that considers both the setting in which the prayer\narises and the audience to whom it is directed.\n   The prayer opportunity in this case must be evaluated\nagainst the backdrop of historical practice. As a practice\nthat has long endured, legislative prayer has become part\nof our heritage and tradition, part of our expressive idiom,\nsimilar to the Pledge of Allegiance, inaugural prayer, or\nthe recitation of “God save the United States and this\nhonorable Court” at the opening of this Court’s sessions.\nSee Lynch, 465 U. S., at 693 (O’Connor, J., concurring). It\nis presumed that the reasonable observer is acquainted\nwith this tradition and understands that its purposes are\nto lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge\nthe place religion holds in the lives of many private citi­\nzens, not to afford government an opportunity to proselyt­\nize or force truant constituents into the pews.

But their\npurpose is largely to accommodate the spiritual needs of\nlawmakers and connect them to a tradition dating to the\ntime of the Framers. For members of town boards and\ncommissions, who often serve part-time and as volunteers,\nceremonial prayer may also reflect the values they hold as\nprivate citizens. The prayer is an opportunity for them to\nshow who and what they are without denying the right to\ndissent by those who disagree.\n   The analysis would be different if town board members\ndirected the public to participate in the prayers, singled\nout dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their\ndecisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence\nin the prayer opportunity. No such thing occurred in the\ntown of Greece. Although board members themselves\nstood, bowed their heads, or made the sign of the cross\nduring the prayer, they at no point solicited similar ges­\ntures by the public. Respondents point to several occa­\nsions where audience members were asked to rise for the\nprayer. These requests, however, came not from town\nleaders but from the guest ministers, who presumably are\naccustomed to directing their congregations in this way\nand might have done so thinking the action was inclusive,\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

Respondents suggest that constituents\nmight feel pressure to join the prayers to avoid irritating\nthe officials who would be ruling on their petitions, but\nthis argument has no evidentiary support. Nothing in the\nrecord indicates that town leaders allocated benefits and\nburdens based on participation in the prayer, or that\ncitizens were received differently depending on whether\nthey joined the invocation or quietly declined. In no in­\nstance did town leaders signal disfavor toward nonpartici­\npants or suggest that their stature in the community was\nin any way diminished. A practice that classified citizens\nbased on their religious views would violate the Constitu­\ntion, but that is not the case before this Court.\n   In their declarations in the trial court, respondents\nstated that the prayers gave them offense and made them\nfeel excluded and disrespected. Offense, however, does not\nequate to coercion. Adults often encounter speech they\nfind disagreeable; and an Establishment Clause violation\nis not made out any time a person experiences a sense of\naffront from the expression of contrary religious views in a\nlegislative forum, especially where, as here, any member\nof the public is welcome in turn to offer an invocation\nreflecting his or her own convictions.

Courts\nremain free to review the pattern of prayers over time to\ndetermine whether they comport with the tradition of\nsolemn, respectful prayer approved in Marsh, or whether\ncoercion is a real and substantial likelihood. But in the\ngeneral course legislative bodies do not engage in imper­\nmissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer\nthey would rather not hear and in which they need not\nparticipate.

There the Court\nfound that, in the context of a graduation where school\nauthorities maintained close supervision over the conduct\nof the students and the substance of the ceremony, a\nreligious invocation was coercive as to an objecting stu­\ndent.

Four Justices dissented in\nLee, but the circumstances the Court confronted there are\nnot present in this case and do not control its outcome.\nNothing in the record suggests that members of the public\nare dissuaded from leaving the meeting room during the\nprayer, arriving late, or even, as happened here, making a\nlater protest. In this case, as in Marsh, board members\nand constituents are “free to enter and leave with little\ncomment and for any number of reasons.” Lee, supra, at\n597. Should nonbelievers choose to exit the room during a\nprayer they find distasteful, their absence will not stand\nout as disrespectful or even noteworthy. And should they\nremain, their quiet acquiescence will not, in light of our\ntraditions, be interpreted as an agreement with the words\nor ideas expressed.

S., at 792 (internal quota­\ntion marks and citations omitted).\n   In the town of Greece, the prayer is delivered during the\nceremonial portion of the town’s meeting. Board members\nare not engaged in policymaking at this time, but in more\ngeneral functions, such as swearing in new police officers,\ninducting high school athletes into the town hall of fame,\nand presenting proclamations to volunteers, civic groups,\nand senior citizens. It is a moment for town leaders to\nrecognize the achievements of their constituents and the\naspects of community life that are worth celebrating. By\ninviting ministers to serve as chaplain for the month, and\nwelcoming them to the front of the room alongside civic\nleaders, the town is acknowledging the central place that\nreligion, and religious institutions, hold in the lives of\nthose present. Indeed, some congregations are not simply\nspiritual homes for town residents but also the provider of\nsocial services for citizens regardless of their beliefs. See\nApp. 31a (thanking a pastor for his “community involve­\nment”); id., at 44a (thanking a deacon “for the job that you\nhave done on behalf of our community”). The inclusion of\na brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise in\ncivic recognition suggests that its purpose and effect are to\nacknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they\nrepresent rather than to exclude or coerce nonbelievers.\n   Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this\nNation was founded and until the present day, many\nAmericans deem that their own existence must be under­\nstood by precepts far beyond the authority of government\nto alter or define and that willing participation in civic\naffairs can be consistent with a brief acknowledgment of\ntheir belief in a higher power, always with due respect for\nthose who adhere to other beliefs. The prayer in this case\nhas a permissible ceremonial purpose. It is not an uncon­\nstitutional establishment of religion.\n\f24            TOWN OF GREECE v.

Presumably, Jewish resi­\ndents of the town worship at one or more of those syna­\ngogues, but because these synagogues fall outside the\ntown’s borders, they were not listed in the town’s local\ndirectory, and the responsible town employee did not\ninclude them on her list.

According to the\nprincipal dissent, the town could have avoided any consti­\ntutional problem in either of two ways.\n                              A\n  First, the principal dissent writes, “[i]f the Town Board\nhad let its chaplains know that they should speak in non­\nsectarian terms, common to diverse religious groups, then\nno one would have valid grounds for complaint.” Post, at\n18–19. “Priests and ministers, rabbis and imams,” the\nprincipal dissent continues, “give such invocations all the\ntime” without any great difficulty. Post, at 19.\n  Both Houses of Congress now advise guest chaplains\nthat they should keep in mind that they are addressing\nmembers from a variety of faith traditions, and as a mat­\nter of policy, this advice has much to recommend it. But\nany argument that nonsectarian prayer is constitutionally\nrequired runs headlong into a long history of contrary\ncongressional practice. From the beginning, as the Court\nnotes, many Christian prayers were offered in the House\nand Senate, see ante, at 7, and when rabbis and other non-\nChristian clergy have served as guest chaplains, their\nprayers have often been couched in terms particular to\ntheir faith traditions.3\n——————\n  3 For example, when a rabbi first delivered a prayer at a session of\n\nthe House of Representatives in 1860, he appeared “in full rabbinic\ndress, ‘piously bedecked in a white tallit and a large velvet skullcap,’ ”\nand his prayer “invoked several uniquely Jewish themes and repeated\nthe Biblical priestly blessing in Hebrew.” See Brief for Nathan Lewin\nas Amicus Curiae 9. Many other rabbis have given distinctively Jewish\nprayers, id., at 10, and n. 3, and distinctively Islamic, Buddhist, and\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)             5\n\n                         ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   Not only is there no historical support for the proposi­\ntion that only generic prayer is allowed, but as our country\nhas become more diverse, composing a prayer that is\nacceptable to all members of the community who hold\nreligious beliefs has become harder and harder. It was\none thing to compose a prayer that is acceptable to both\nChristians and Jews; it is much harder to compose a prayer\nthat is also acceptable to followers of Eastern religions\nthat are now well represented in this country. Many local\nclergy may find the project daunting, if not impossible,\nand some may feel that they cannot in good faith deliver\nsuch a vague prayer.\n   In addition, if a town attempts to go beyond simply\nrecommending that a guest chaplain deliver a prayer that\nis broadly acceptable to all members of a particular com­\nmunity (and the groups represented in different communi­\nties will vary), the town will inevitably encounter sensitive\nproblems. Must a town screen and, if necessary, edit\nprayers before they are given? If prescreening is not\nrequired, must the town review prayers after they are\ndelivered in order to determine if they were sufficiently\ngeneric? And if a guest chaplain crosses the line, what\nmust the town do? Must the chaplain be corrected on the\nspot? Must the town strike this chaplain (and perhaps his\nor her house of worship) from the approved list?\n                              B\n  If a town wants to avoid the problems associated with\nthis first option, the principal dissent argues, it has an­\nother choice: It may “invit[e] clergy of many faiths.” Post,\nat 19. “When one month a clergy member refers to Jesus,\nand the next to Allah or Jehovah,” the principal dissent\nexplains, “the government does not identify itself with one\nreligion or align itself with that faith’s citizens, and the\n—————— \n\nHindu prayers have also been delivered, see ante, at 10–11. \n\n\f6             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\neffect of even sectarian prayer is transformed.” Ibid.\n   If, as the principal dissent appears to concede, such a\nrotating system would obviate any constitutional prob­\nlems, then despite all its high rhetoric, the principal dis­\nsent’s quarrel with the town of Greece really boils down to\nthis: The town’s clerical employees did a bad job in compil­\ning the list of potential guest chaplains. For that is really\nthe only difference between what the town did and what\nthe principal dissent is willing to accept. The Greece\nclerical employee drew up her list using the town directory\ninstead of a directory covering the entire greater Roches­\nter area. If the task of putting together the list had been\nhandled in a more sophisticated way, the employee in\ncharge would have realized that the town’s Jewish resi­\ndents attended synagogues on the Rochester side of the\nborder and would have added one or more synagogues to\nthe list. But the mistake was at worst careless, and it was\nnot done with a discriminatory intent. (I would view this\ncase very differently if the omission of these synagogues\nwere intentional.)\n   The informal, imprecise way in which the town lined up\nguest chaplains is typical of the way in which many things\nare done in small and medium-sized units of local govern­\nment. In such places, the members of the governing body\nalmost always have day jobs that occupy much of their\ntime. The town almost never has a legal office and instead\nrelies for legal advice on a local attorney whose practice is\nlikely to center on such things as land-use regulation,\ncontracts, and torts. When a municipality like the town of\nGreece seeks in good faith to emulate the congressional\npractice on which our holding in Marsh v. Chambers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111014\"><a href=\"/opinion/111014/marsh-v-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), was largely based, that municipality\nshould not be held to have violated the Constitution sim­\nply because its method of recruiting guest chaplains lacks\nthe demographic exactitude that might be regarded as\noptimal.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   The effect of requiring such exactitude would be to\npressure towns to forswear altogether the practice of\nhaving a prayer before meetings of the town council.\nMany local officials, puzzled by our often puzzling Estab­\nlishment Clause jurisprudence and terrified of the legal\nfees that may result from a lawsuit claiming a constitu­\ntional violation, already think that the safest course is to\nensure that local government is a religion-free zone.\nIndeed, the Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case advised\ntowns that constitutional difficulties “may well prompt\nmunicipalities to pause and think carefully before adopt­\ning legislative prayer.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 34. But if, as prece­\ndent and historic practice make clear (and the principal\ndissent concedes), prayer before a legislative session is not\ninherently inconsistent with the First Amendment, then a\nunit of local government should not be held to have violated\nthe First Amendment simply because its procedure for\nlining up guest chaplains does not comply in all respects\nwith what might be termed a “best practices” standard.\n                               III\n   While the principal dissent, in the end, would demand\nno more than a small modification in the procedure that\nthe town of Greece initially followed, much of the rhetoric\nin that opinion sweeps more broadly. Indeed, the logical\nthrust of many of its arguments is that prayer is never\npermissible prior to meetings of local government legisla­\ntive bodies. At Greece Town Board meetings, the principal\ndissent pointedly notes, ordinary citizens (and even chil­\ndren!) are often present. Post, at 10–11. The guest chap­\nlains stand in front of the room facing the public. “[T]he\nsetting is intimate,” and ordinary citizens are permitted to\nspeak and to ask the board to address problems that have\na direct effect on their lives. Post, at 11. The meetings are\n“occasions for ordinary citizens to engage with and peti­\ntion their government, often on highly individualized\n\f8                TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                          ALITO, J., concurring\n\nmatters.” Post, at 9. Before a session of this sort, the\nprincipal dissent argues, any prayer that is not acceptable\nto all in attendance is out of bounds.\n  The features of Greece meetings that the principal\ndissent highlights are by no means unusual.4 It is com­\nmon for residents to attend such meetings, either to speak\non matters on the agenda or to request that the town\naddress other issues that are important to them. Nor is\nthere anything unusual about the occasional attendance of\nstudents, and when a prayer is given at the beginning of\nsuch a meeting, I expect that the chaplain generally\nstands at the front of the room and faces the public. To do\notherwise would probably be seen by many as rude. Fi-\nnally, although the principal dissent, post, at 13, attaches\nimportance to the fact that guest chaplains in the town of\nGreece often began with the words “Let us pray,” that is\nalso commonplace and for many clergy, I suspect, almost\nreflexive.5 In short, I see nothing out of the ordinary\nabout any of the features that the principal dissent notes.\nTherefore, if prayer is not allowed at meetings with those\ncharacteristics, local government legislative bodies, unlike\ntheir national and state counterparts, cannot begin their\nmeetings with a prayer. I see no sound basis for drawing\nsuch a distinction.\n\n\n——————\n    4 See,\n         e.g., prayer practice of Saginaw City Council in Michigan, de­\nscribed in Letter from Freedom from Religion Foundation to City\nManager, Saginaw City Council (Jan. 31, 2014), online at\nhttp://media.mlive.com/saginawnews_impact/other/Saginaw%20prayer\n%20at%20meetings%20letter.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May\n2, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); prayer practice of\nCobb County commissions in Georgia, described in Pelphrey v.

Chambers, which upheld the constitu­\ntionality of the Nebraska Legislature’s practice of prayer\nat the beginning of legislative sessions, but the principal\ndissent’s acceptance of Marsh appears to be predicated on\nthe view that the prayer at issue in that case was little\nmore than a formality to which the legislators paid scant\nattention. The principal dissent describes this scene: A\nsession of the state legislature begins with or without\nmost members present; a strictly nonsectarian prayer is\nrecited while some legislators remain seated; and few\nmembers of the public are exposed to the experience. Post,\nat 8–9. This sort of perfunctory and hidden-away prayer,\nthe principal dissent implies, is all that Marsh and the\nFirst Amendment can tolerate.\n   It is questionable whether the principal dissent accu­\nrately describes the Nebraska practice at issue in Marsh,6\nbut what is important is not so much what happened in\nNebraska in the years prior to Marsh, but what happened\nbefore congressional sessions during the period leading up\nto the adoption of the First Amendment. By that time,\nprayer before legislative sessions already had an impres­\nsive pedigree, and it is important to recall that history and\nthe events that led to the adoption of the practice.\n   The principal dissent paints a picture of “morning in\n——————\n  6 See generally Brief for Robert E.

The First Continental Congress convened in Phila­\ndelphia, and the need for the 13 colonies to unite was\nimperative. But “[m]any things set colony apart from\ncolony,” and prominent among these sources of division\nwas religion.7 “Purely as a practical matter,” however, the\nproject of bringing the colonies together required that\nthese divisions be overcome.8\n   Samuel Adams sought to bridge these differences by\nprodding a fellow Massachusetts delegate to move to open\nthe session with a prayer.9 As John Adams later recounted,\nthis motion was opposed on the ground that the dele-\ngates were “so divided in religious sentiments, some Epis­\ncopalians, some Quakers, some Anabaptists, some\nPresbyterians, and some Congregationalists, that [they]\ncould not join in the same act of worship.”10 In response,\nSamuel Adams proclaimed that “he was no bigot, and\ncould hear a prayer from a gentleman of piety and virtue,\nwho was at the same time a friend to his country.”11 Put­\nting aside his personal prejudices,12 he moved to invite a\nlocal Anglican minister, Jacob Duché, to lead the first\nprayer.13\n   The following morning, Duché appeared in full “pontifi­\n——————\n   7 G.

But\nDuché’s prayer met with wide approval—John Adams\nwrote that it “filled the bosom of every man” in attend­\nance15—and the practice was continued. This first con­\ngressional prayer was emphatically Christian, and it was\nneither an empty formality nor strictly nondenominational.16\nBut one of its purposes, and presumably one of its\neffects, was not to divide, but to unite.\n   It is no wonder, then, that the practice of beginning\ncongressional sessions with a prayer was continued after\nthe Revolution ended and the new Constitution was\nadopted. One of the first actions taken by the new Con­\ngress when it convened in 1789 was to appoint chaplains\nfor both Houses. The first Senate chaplain, an Episcopa-\nlian, was appointed on April 25, 1789, and the first House\nchaplain, a Presbyterian, was appointed on May 1.17\nThree days later, Madison announced that he planned to\nintroduce proposed constitutional amendments to protect\nindividual rights; on June 8, 1789, those amendments\nwere introduced; and on September 26, 1789, the amend­\nments were approved to be sent to the States for ratifica­\ntion.18 In the years since the adoption of the First\n——————\n  14 Ibid.\n  15 Ibid.; see W.

Michigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n980 (1991), Carroll v.

Thus, in Marsh, when the Court was called\nupon to decide whether prayer prior to sessions of a state\nlegislature was consistent with the Establishment Clause,\nwe relied heavily on the history of prayer before sessions\nof Congress and held that a state legislature may follow a\nsimilar practice. See 463 U. S., at 786–792.\n  There can be little doubt that the decision in Marsh\nreflected the original understanding of the First Amend­\nment. It is virtually inconceivable that the First Congress,\nhaving appointed chaplains whose responsibilities promi­\nnently included the delivery of prayers at the beginning of\neach daily session, thought that this practice was incon­\nsistent with the Establishment Clause. And since this\npractice was well established and undoubtedly well\nknown, it seems equally clear that the state legislatures\nthat ratified the First Amendment had the same under­\nstanding. In the case before us, the Court of Appeals\nappeared to base its decision on one of the Establishment\nClause “tests” set out in the opinions of this Court, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 26, 30, but if there is any inconsistency between\nany of those tests and the historic practice of legislative\nprayer, the inconsistency calls into question the validity of\nthe test, not the historic practice.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

I am troubled by the\nmessage that some readers may take from the principal\ndissent’s rhetoric and its highly imaginative hypotheticals.\nFor example, the principal dissent conjures up the image\nof a litigant awaiting trial who is asked by the presiding\njudge to rise for a Christian prayer, of an official at a\npolling place who conveys the expectation that citizens\nwishing to vote make the sign of the cross before casting\ntheir ballots, and of an immigrant seeking naturalization\nwho is asked to bow her head and recite a Christian\nprayer. Although I do not suggest that the implication is\nintentional, I am concerned that at least some readers will\ntake these hypotheticals as a warning that this is where\ntoday’s decision leads—to a country in which religious\nminorities are denied the equal benefits of citizenship.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. All that the\nCourt does today is to allow a town to follow a practice\nthat we have previously held is permissible for Congress\nand state legislatures. In seeming to suggest otherwise,\nthe principal dissent goes far astray.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

Virginia, by contrast, had\nrecently abolished its official state establishment and\nended direct government funding of clergy after a legisla-\ntive battle led by James Madison. See T. Buckley, Church\nand State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776–1787, pp. 155–\n164 (1977).      Other States—principally Rhode Island,\nPennsylvania, and Delaware, which were founded by\nreligious dissenters—had no history of formal establish-\nments at all, although they still maintained religious tests\nfor office. See McConnell, The Origins and Historical\nUnderstanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv.\nL. Rev. 1409, 1425–1426, 1430 (1990).\n   The import of this history is that the relationship be-\ntween church and state in the fledgling Republic was far\nfrom settled at the time of ratification. See Muñoz, The\nOriginal Meaning of the Establishment Clause and the\nImpossibility of Its Incorporation, 8 U. Pa. J. Constitu-\ntional L. 585, 605 (2006). Although the remaining state\nestablishments were ultimately dismantled—Massachusetts,\nthe last State to disestablish, would do so in 1833, see Levy\n42—that outcome was far from assured when the Bill of\nRights was ratified in 1791. That lack of consensus sug-\ngests that the First Amendment was simply agnostic on\nthe subject of state establishments; the decision to estab-\nlish or disestablish religion was reserved to the States.\nAmar 41.\n   The Federalist logic of the original Establishment\nClause poses a special barrier to its mechanical incorpora-\ntion against the States through the Fourteenth Amend-\nment. See id., at 33. Unlike the Free Exercise Clause,\nwhich “plainly protects individuals against congressional\ninterference with the right to exercise their religion,” the\n\f4             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nEstablishment Clause “does not purport to protect indi-\nvidual rights.” Newdow, 542 U. S., at 50 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Instead, the States are the particular benefi-\nciaries of the Clause. Incorporation therefore gives rise to\na paradoxical result: Applying the Clause against the\nStates eliminates their right to establish a religion free\nfrom federal interference, thereby “prohibit[ing] exactly\nwhat the Establishment Clause protected.” Id., at 51; see\nAmar 33–34.\n    Put differently, the structural reasons that counsel\nagainst incorporating the Tenth Amendment also apply to\nthe Establishment Clause. Id., at 34. To my knowledge,\nno court has ever suggested that the Tenth Amendment,\nwhich “reserve[s] to the States” powers not delegated to\nthe Federal Government, could or should be applied\nagainst the States. To incorporate that limitation would\nbe to divest the States of all powers not specifically dele-\ngated to them, thereby inverting the original import of the\nAmendment. Incorporating the Establishment Clause has\nprecisely the same effect.\n    The most cogent argument in favor of incorporation may\nbe that, by the time of Reconstruction, the framers of the\nFourteenth Amendment had come to reinterpret the Es-\ntablishment Clause (notwithstanding its Federalist ori-\ngins) as expressing an individual right. On this question,\nhistorical evidence from the 1860’s is mixed. Congressmen\nwho catalogued the personal rights protected by the First\nAmendment commonly referred to speech, press, petition,\nand assembly, but not to a personal right of nonestablish-\nment; instead, they spoke only of “ ‘free exercise’ ” or\n“ ‘freedom of conscience.’ ” Amar 253, and 385, n. 91 (col-\nlecting sources). There may be reason to think these lists\nwere abbreviated, and silence on the issue is not disposi-\ntive. See Lash, The Second Adoption of the Establishment\nClause: The Rise of the Nonestablishment Principle, 27\nAriz. St. L. J. 1085, 1141–1145 (1995); but cf. S.

Given the\ntextual and logical difficulties posed by incorporation,\nhowever, there is no warrant for transforming the mean-\ning of the Establishment Clause without a firm historical\nfoundation.    See Newdow, supra, at 51 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.).

The Court of Appeals\ndid not believe that the Constitution forbids legislative\nprayers that incorporate content associated with a particu-\nlar denomination. Id., at 28. Rather, the court’s holding\ntook that content into account simply because it indicated\nthat the town had not followed a sufficiently inclusive\n“prayer-giver selection process.” Id., at 30. It also took\ninto account related “actions (and inactions) of prayer-\ngivers and town officials.” Ibid. Those actions and inac-\ntions included (1) a selection process that led to the selec-\ntion of “clergy almost exclusively from places of worship\nlocated within the town’s borders,” despite the likelihood\nthat significant numbers of town residents were members\nof congregations that gather just outside those borders; (2)\na failure to “infor[m] members of the general public that\nvolunteers” would be acceptable prayer givers; and (3) a\nfailure to “infor[m] prayer-givers that invocations were not\nto be exploited as an effort to convert others to the partic-\nular faith of the invocational speaker, nor to disparage\nany faith or belief different than that of the invoca-\n\f2             TOWN OF GREECE v.

It did not hold that “the town may not open\nits public meetings with a prayer,” or that “any prayers\noffered in this context must be blandly ‘nonsectarian.’ ”\nId., at 33. In essence, the Court of Appeals merely held\nthat the town must do more than it had previously done to\ntry to make its prayer practices inclusive of other faiths.\nAnd it did not prescribe a single constitutionally required\nmethod for doing so.\n   In my view, the Court of Appeals’ conclusion and its\nreasoning are convincing. JUSTICE KAGAN’s dissent is\nconsistent with that view, and I join it. I also here empha-\nsize several factors that I believe underlie the conclusion\nthat, on the particular facts of this case, the town’s prayer\npractice violated the Establishment Clause.\n   First, Greece is a predominantly Christian town, but it\nis not exclusively so. A map of the town’s houses of wor-\nship introduced in the District Court shows many Chris-\ntian churches within the town’s limits. It also shows a\nBuddhist temple within the town and several Jewish\nsynagogues just outside its borders, in the adjacent city of\nRochester, New York. Id., at 24. Yet during the more\nthan 120 monthly meetings at which prayers were deliv-\nered during the record period (from 1999 to 2010), only\nfour prayers were delivered by non-Christians. And all of\nthese occurred in 2008, shortly after the plaintiffs began\ncomplaining about the town’s Christian prayer practice\nand nearly a decade after that practice had commenced.\nSee post, at 14, 21.\n   To be precise: During 2008, two prayers were delivered\nby a Jewish layman, one by the chairman of a Baha’i\ncongregation, and one by a Wiccan priestess. The Jewish\nand Wiccan prayer givers were invited only after they\nreached out to the town to inquire about giving an invoca-\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              3\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion. The town apparently invited the Baha’i chairman on\nits own initiative. The inclusivity of the 2008 meetings,\nwhich contrasts starkly with the exclusively single-\ndenomination prayers every year before and after, is\ncommendable. But the Court of Appeals reasonably de-\ncided not to give controlling weight to that inclusivity, for it\narose only in response to the complaints that presaged this\nlitigation, and it did not continue into the following years.\n   Second, the town made no significant effort to inform\nthe area’s non-Christian houses of worship about the\npossibility of delivering an opening prayer. See post, at\n21. Beginning in 1999, when it instituted its practice of\nopening its monthly board meetings with prayer, Greece\nselected prayer givers as follows: Initially, the town’s\nemployees invited clergy from each religious organization\nlisted in a “Community Guide” published by the Greece\nChamber of Commerce. After that, the town kept a list of\nclergy who had accepted invitations and reinvited those\nclergy to give prayers at future meetings. From time to\ntime, the town supplemented this list in response to re-\nquests from citizens and to new additions to the Commu-\nnity Guide and a town newspaper called the Greece Post.\n   The plaintiffs do not argue that the town intentionally\ndiscriminated against non-Christians when choosing\nwhom to invite, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 26, and the town claims,\nplausibly, that it would have allowed anyone who asked to\ngive an invocation to do so. Rather, the evident reasons\nwhy the town consistently chose Christian prayer givers\nare that the Buddhist and Jewish temples mentioned\nabove were not listed in the Community Guide or the\nGreece Post and that the town limited its list of clergy\nalmost exclusively to representatives of houses of worship\nsituated within Greece’s town limits (again, the Buddhist\ntemple on the map was within those limits, but the syna-\ngogues were just outside them). Id., at 24, 31.\n   Third, in this context, the fact that nearly all of the\n\f4             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprayers given reflected a single denomination takes on\nsignificance. That significance would have been the same\nhad all the prayers been Jewish, or Hindu, or Buddhist, or\nof any other denomination. The significance is that, in a\ncontext where religious minorities exist and where more\ncould easily have been done to include their participation,\nthe town chose to do nothing. It could, for example, have\nposted its policy of permitting anyone to give an invocation\non its website, greeceny.gov, which provides dates and\ntimes of upcoming town board meetings along with\nminutes of prior meetings. It could have announced inclu-\nsive policies at the beginning of its board meetings, just\nbefore introducing the month’s prayer giver. It could have\nprovided information to those houses of worship of all\nfaiths that lie just outside its borders and include citizens\nof Greece among their members. Given that the town\ncould easily have made these or similar efforts but chose\nnot to, the fact that all of the prayers (aside from the 2008\noutliers) were given by adherents of a single religion re-\nflects a lack of effort to include others. And that is what I\ntake to be a major point of JUSTICE KAGAN’s related dis-\ncussion. See post, at 2–4, 9, 14–15, 21–23.\n   Fourth, the fact that the board meeting audience in-\ncluded citizens with business to conduct also contributes\nto the importance of making more of an effort to include\nmembers of other denominations. It does not, however,\nautomatically change the nature of the meeting from one\nwhere an opening prayer is permissible under the Estab-\nlishment Clause to one where it is not. Cf. post, at 8–14,\n16–17, 20.\n   Fifth, it is not normally government’s place to rewrite,\nto parse, or to critique the language of particular prayers.\nAnd it is always possible that members of one religious\ngroup will find that prayers of other groups (or perhaps\neven a moment of silence) are not compatible with their\nfaith. Despite this risk, the Constitution does not forbid\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)              5\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nopening prayers. But neither does the Constitution forbid\nefforts to explain to those who give the prayers the nature\nof the occasion and the audience.\n   The U. S. House of Representatives, for example, pro-\nvides its guest chaplains with the following guidelines,\nwhich are designed to encourage the sorts of prayer that\nare consistent with the purpose of an invocation for a\ngovernment body in a religiously pluralistic Nation:\n    “The guest chaplain should keep in mind that the\n    House of Representatives is comprised of Members of\n    many different faith traditions.\n    “The length of the prayer should not exceed 150\n    words.\n    “The prayer must be free from personal political views\n    or partisan politics, from sectarian controversies, and\n    from any intimations pertaining to foreign or domestic\n    policy.” App. to Brief for Respondents 2a.\nThe town made no effort to promote a similarly inclusive\nprayer practice here. See post, at 21–22.\n  As both the Court and JUSTICE KAGAN point out, we are\na Nation of many religions. Ante, at 10–11; post, at 1–2,\n18.

So that when each person performs the duties or\nseeks the benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an\nadherent to one or another religion, but simply as an\nAmerican.\n  I respectfully dissent from the Court’s opinion because I\nthink the Town of Greece’s prayer practices violate that\nnorm of religious equality—the breathtakingly generous\nconstitutional idea that our public institutions belong no\nless to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or\nEpiscopalian. I do not contend that principle translates\nhere into a bright separationist line. To the contrary, I\n\f2             TOWN OF GREECE v.

But\nstill, the Town of Greece should lose this case. The prac­\ntice at issue here differs from the one sustained in Marsh\nbecause Greece’s town meetings involve participation by\nordinary citizens, and the invocations given—directly to\nthose citizens—were predominantly sectarian in content.\nStill more, Greece’s Board did nothing to recognize reli­\ngious diversity: In arranging for clergy members to open\neach meeting, the Town never sought (except briefly when\nthis suit was filed) to involve, accommodate, or in any way\nreach out to adherents of non-Christian religions. So\nmonth in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped\nin only one faith, addressed toward members of the public,\ncommenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute\ngovernment benefits. In my view, that practice does not\nsquare with the First Amendment’s promise that every\ncitizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in\nher government.\n                              I\n  To begin to see what has gone wrong in the Town of\nGreece, consider several hypothetical scenarios in which\nsectarian prayer—taken straight from this case’s record—\ninfuses governmental activities. None involves, as this\ncase does, a proceeding that could be characterized as a\nlegislative session, but they are useful to elaborate some\ngeneral principles. In each instance, assume (as was true\nin Greece) that the invocation is given pursuant to gov­\nernment policy and is representative of the prayers gener­\nally offered in the designated setting:\n\f              Cite as: 572 U.

The judge bangs his gavel\n  to call the court to order, asks a minister to come to\n  the front of the room, and instructs the 10 or so in­\n  dividuals present to rise for an opening prayer.\n  The clergyman faces those in attendance and says:\n  “Lord, God of all creation, . . . . We acknowledge\n  the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.\n  We draw strength . . . from his resurrection at\n  Easter. Jesus Christ, who took away the sins of the\n  world, destroyed our death, through his dying and\n  in his rising, he has restored our life.

I have every confidence the Court\nwould agree. See ante, at 13 (ALITO, J., concurring). And\neven Greece’s attorney conceded that something like the\nfirst hypothetical (he was not asked about the others)\nwould violate the First Amendment. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n3–4. Why?\n   The reason, of course, has nothing to do with Christian­\nity as such. This opinion is full of Christian prayers, be­\ncause those were the only invocations offered in the Town\nof Greece. But if my hypotheticals involved the prayer of\nsome other religion, the outcome would be exactly the\nsame. Suppose, for example, that government officials in\na predominantly Jewish community asked a rabbi to begin\nall public functions with a chanting of the Sh’ma and\nV’ahavta. (“Hear O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is\nOne. . . . Bind [these words] as a sign upon your hand; let\nthem be a symbol before your eyes; inscribe them on the\ndoorposts of your house, and on your gates.”) Or assume\nofficials in a mostly Muslim town requested a muezzin to\ncommence such functions, over and over again, with a\n\f                   Cite as: 572 U.

I bear wit­\nness that Muhammed is the Messenger of God.”) In any\ninstance, the question would be why such government­\nsponsored prayer of a single religion goes beyond the\nconstitutional pale.\n   One glaring problem is that the government in all these\nhypotheticals has aligned itself with, and placed its im­\nprimatur on, a particular religious creed. “The clearest\ncommand of the Establishment Clause,” this Court has\nheld, “is that one religious denomination cannot be offi-\ncially preferred over another.” Larson v.

The\n\ndemand for neutrality among religions is not a product of 21st century\n“political correctness,” but of the 18th century view—rendered no less\nwise by time—that, in George Washington’s words, “[r]eligious contro­\nversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconciliable\nhatreds than those which spring from any other cause.” Letter to\nEdward Newenham (June 22, 1792), in 10 Papers of George Washing­\nton: Presidential Series 493 (R. Haggard & M. Mastromarino eds. 2002)\n(hereinafter PGW). In an age when almost no one in this country was\nnot a Christian of one kind or another, Washington consistently de­\nclined to use language or imagery associated only with that religion.\nSee Brief for Paul Finkelman et al. as Amici Curiae 15–19 (noting, for\nexample, that in revising his first inaugural address, Washington\ndeleted the phrase “the blessed Religion revealed in the word of God”\nbecause it was understood to denote only Christianity). Thomas\nJefferson, who followed the same practice throughout his life, explained\nthat he omitted any reference to Jesus Christ in Virginia’s Bill for\nEstablishing Religious Freedom (a precursor to the Establishment\nClause) in order “to comprehend, within the mantle of [the law’s]\nprotection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the\nHindoo, and infidel of every denomination.” 1 Writings of Thomas\nJefferson 62 (P. Ford ed. 1892). And James Madison, who again used\nonly nonsectarian language in his writings and addresses, warned that\nreligious proclamations might, “if not strictly guarded,” express only\n“the creed of the majority and a single sect.” Madison’s “Detached\nMemoranda,” 3 Wm. & Mary Quarterly 534, 561 (1946).\n\f                  Cite as: 572 U.

A person goes to court, to the polls, to a naturaliza­\ntion ceremony—and a government official or his hand­\npicked minister asks her, as the first order of official\nbusiness, to stand and pray with others in a way conflict­\ning with her own religious beliefs. Perhaps she feels suffi-\ncient pressure to go along—to rise, bow her head, and join\nin whatever others are saying: After all, she wants,\nvery badly, what the judge or poll worker or immigration\nofficial has to offer. Or perhaps she is made of stronger\nmettle, and she opts not to participate in what she does not\nbelieve—indeed, what would, for her, be something like\nblasphemy. She then must make known her dissent from\nthe common religious view, and place herself apart from\nother citizens, as well as from the officials responsible for\nthe invocations. And so a civic function of some kind\nbrings religious differences to the fore: That public pro­\nceeding becomes (whether intentionally or not) an instru­\nment for dividing her from adherents to the community’s\nmajority religion, and for altering the very nature of her\nrelationship with her government.\n   That is not the country we are, because that is not what\nour Constitution permits. Here, when a citizen stands\nbefore her government, whether to perform a service or\nrequest a benefit, her religious beliefs do not enter into the\npicture. See Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Act for Establish­\ning Religious Freedom (Oct. 31, 1785), in 5 The Founders’\nConstitution 85 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987)\n(“[O]pinion[s] in matters of religion . . . shall in no wise\ndiminish, enlarge, or affect [our] civil capacities”). The\ngovernment she faces favors no particular religion, either\nby word or by deed. And that government, in its various\nprocesses and proceedings, imposes no religious tests on\nits citizens, sorts none of them by faith, and permits no\nexclusion based on belief.

Ante, at 10. And\nbefore I dispute the Town and Court, I want to give them\ntheir due: They are right that, under Marsh, legislative\nprayer has a distinctive constitutional warrant by virtue of\ntradition. As the Court today describes, a long history,\nstretching back to the first session of Congress (when\nchaplains began to give prayers in both Chambers), “ha[s]\nshown that prayer in this limited context could ‘coexis[t]\nwith the principles of disestablishment and religious\nfreedom.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting Marsh, 463 U. S., at 786).\nRelying on that “unbroken” national tradition, Marsh\nupheld (I think correctly) the Nebraska Legislature’s\npractice of opening each day with a chaplain’s prayer as “a\ntolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among\nthe people of this country.” Id., at 792. And so I agree\nwith the majority that the issue here is “whether the\nprayer practice in the Town of Greece fits within the tradi­\ntion long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.”\nAnte, at 9.\n   Where I depart from the majority is in my reply to that\nquestion. The town hall here is a kind of hybrid. Greece’s\nBoard indeed has legislative functions, as Congress and\nstate assemblies do—and that means some opening pray­\ners are allowed there. But much as in my hypotheticals,\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U.

That feature calls for\nBoard members to exercise special care to ensure that the\nprayers offered are inclusive—that they respect each and\nevery member of the community as an equal citizen.2 But\nthe Board, and the clergy members it selected, made no\nsuch effort. Instead, the prayers given in Greece, ad­\ndressed directly to the Town’s citizenry, were more sec­\ntarian, and less inclusive, than anything this Court sus­\ntained in Marsh. For those reasons, the prayer in Greece\ndeparts from the legislative tradition that the majority\ntakes as its benchmark.\n                              A\n  Start by comparing two pictures, drawn precisely from\nreality. The first is of Nebraska’s (unicameral) Legisla­\nture, as this Court and the state senators themselves\ndescribed it. The second is of town council meetings in\nGreece, as revealed in this case’s record.\n  It is morning in Nebraska, and senators are beginning\nto gather in the State’s legislative chamber: It is the be­\nginning of the official workday, although senators may not\nyet need to be on the floor.

I do\nnot remotely contend that “prayer is not allowed” at participatory\nmeetings of “local government legislative bodies”; nor is that the\n“logical thrust” of any argument I make. Ante, at 7–8. Rather, what I\nsay throughout this opinion is that in this citizen-centered venue,\ngovernment officials must take steps to ensure—as none of Greece’s\nBoard members ever did—that opening prayers are inclusive of differ­\nent faiths, rather than always identified with a single religion.\n\f10            TOWN OF GREECE v.

Any members of the public who\nhappen to be in attendance—not very many at this early\nhour—watch only from the upstairs visitors’ gallery. See\nApp. 72 in Marsh (senator’s testimony that “as a practical\nmatter the public usually is not there” during the prayer).\n   The longtime chaplain says something like the following\n(the excerpt is from his own amicus brief supporting\nGreece in this case): “O God, who has given all persons\ntalents and varying capacities, Thou dost only require of\nus that we utilize Thy gifts to a maximum. In this Legis­\nlature to which Thou has entrusted special abilities and\nopportunities, may each recognize his stewardship for the\npeople of the State.” Brief for Robert E. Palmer 9. The\nchaplain is a Presbyterian minister, and “some of his\nearlier prayers” explicitly invoked Christian beliefs, but he\n“removed all references to Christ” after a single legislator\ncomplained. Marsh, 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14; Brief for\nPetitioners in Marsh 12. The chaplain also previously\ninvited other clergy members to give the invocation, in­\ncluding local rabbis. See ibid.\n   Now change the channel: It is evening in Greece, New\nYork, and the Supervisor of the Town Board calls its\nmonthly public meeting to order. Those meetings (so says\nthe Board itself) are “the most important part of Town\ngovernment.” See Town of Greece, Town Board, online at\nhttp://greeceny.gov/planning/townboard (as visited May 2,\n2014 and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). They\nserve assorted functions, almost all actively involving\nmembers of the public. The Board may swear in new\nTown employees and hand out awards for civic accom­\nplishments; it always provides an opportunity (called a\nPublic Forum) for citizens to address local issues and ask\nfor improved services or new policies (for example, better\naccommodations for the disabled or actions to ameliorate\ntraffic congestion, see Pl.

But the setting is intimate: There are\nlikely to be only 10 or so citizens in attendance. A few\nmay be children or teenagers, present to receive an award\nor fulfill a high school civics requirement.\n   As the first order of business, the Town Supervisor\nintroduces a local Christian clergy member—denominated\nthe chaplain of the month—to lead the assembled persons\nin prayer. The pastor steps up to a lectern (emblazoned\nwith the Town’s seal) at the front of the dais, and with his\nback to the Town officials, he faces the citizens present.\nHe asks them all to stand and to “pray as we begin this\nevening’s town meeting.” App. 134a. (He does not suggest\nthat anyone should feel free not to participate.) And he\nsays:\n    “The beauties of spring . . . are an expressive symbol\n    of the new life of the risen Christ.

The Supervisor then announces the start of\nthe Public Forum, and a citizen stands up to complain\n\f12            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nabout the Town’s contract with a cable company. See App.\nin No. 10–3635 (CA2), p. A574.\n                             B\n   Let’s count the ways in which these pictures diverge.\nFirst, the governmental proceedings at which the prayers\noccur differ significantly in nature and purpose. The\nNebraska Legislature’s floor sessions—like those of the\nU. S. Congress and other state assemblies—are of, by, and\nfor elected lawmakers. Members of the public take no part\nin those proceedings; any few who attend are spectators\nonly, watching from a high-up visitors’ gallery. (In that\nrespect, note that neither the Nebraska Legislature nor\nthe Congress calls for prayer when citizens themselves\nparticipate in a hearing—say, by giving testimony rele­\nvant to a bill or nomination.) Greece’s town meetings, by\ncontrast, revolve around ordinary members of the commu­\nnity. Each and every aspect of those sessions provides\nopportunities for Town residents to interact with public\nofficials. And the most important parts enable those\ncitizens to petition their government. In the Public Fo­\nrum, they urge (or oppose) changes in the Board’s policies\nand priorities; and then, in what are essentially adjudica­\ntory hearings, they request the Board to grant (or deny)\napplications for various permits, licenses, and zoning\nvariances. So the meetings, both by design and in opera­\ntion, allow citizens to actively participate in the Town’s\ngovernance—sharing concerns, airing grievances, and\nboth shaping the community’s policies and seeking their\nbenefits.\n   Second (and following from what I just said), the pray­\ners in these two settings have different audiences. In the\nNebraska Legislature, the chaplain spoke to, and only to,\nthe elected representatives. Nebraska’s senators were\nadamant on that point in briefing Marsh, and the facts\nfully supported them: As the senators stated, “[t]he activ­\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U.

The same is true in the U. S.\nCongress and, I suspect, in every other state legislature.\nSee Brief for Members of Congress as Amici Curiae 6\n(“Consistent with the fact that attending citizens are mere\npassive observers, prayers in the House are delivered for\nthe Representatives themselves, not those citizens”). As\nseveral Justices later noted (and the majority today\nagrees, see ante, at 19–20),3 Marsh involved “government\nofficials invok[ing] spiritual inspiration entirely for their\nown benefit without directing any religious message at the\ncitizens they lead.” Lee, 505 U. S., at 630, n. 8 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   The very opposite is true in Greece: Contrary to the\nmajority’s characterization, see ante, at 19–20, the prayers\nthere are directed squarely at the citizens. Remember\nthat the chaplain of the month stands with his back to the\nTown Board; his real audience is the group he is facing—\nthe 10 or so members of the public, perhaps including\nchildren. See supra, at 10. And he typically addresses\nthose people, as even the majority observes, as though he\nis “directing [his] congregation.” Ante, at 21. He almost\nalways begins with some version of “Let us all pray to­\ngether.” See, e.g., App. 75a, 93a, 106a, 109a. Often, he\ncalls on everyone to stand and bow their heads, and he\n\n——————\n  3 For ease of reference and to avoid confusion, I refer to JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s opinion as “the majority.” But the language I cite that\nappears in Part II–B of that opinion is, in fact, only attributable to a\nplurality of the Court.\n\f14             TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmay ask them to recite a common prayer with him. See,\ne.g., id., at 28a, 42a, 43a, 56a, 77a. He refers, constantly,\nto a collective “we”—to “our” savior, for example, to the\npresence of the Holy Spirit in “our” lives, or to “our brother\nthe Lord Jesus Christ.” See, e.g., id., at 32a, 45a, 47a, 69a,\n71a. In essence, the chaplain leads, as the first part of a\ntown meeting, a highly intimate (albeit relatively brief)\nprayer service, with the public serving as his congregation.\n   And third, the prayers themselves differ in their content\nand character. Marsh characterized the prayers in the\nNebraska Legislature as “in the Judeo-Christian tradi­\ntion,” and stated, as a relevant (even if not dispositive)\npart of its analysis, that the chaplain had removed all\nexplicitly Christian references at a senator’s request. 463\nU. S., at 793, n. 14. And as the majority acknowledges,\nsee ante, at 12, Marsh hinged on the view that “that the\nprayer opportunity ha[d] [not] been exploited to proselyt­\nize or advance any one . . . faith or belief ”; had it been\notherwise, the Court would have reached a different deci­\nsion. 463 U. S., at 794–795.\n   But no one can fairly read the prayers from Greece’s\nTown meetings as anything other than explicitly Chris­\ntian—constantly and exclusively so. From the time Greece\nestablished its prayer practice in 1999 until litigation\nloomed nine years later, all of its monthly chaplains were\nChristian clergy. And after a brief spell surrounding the\nfiling of this suit (when a Jewish layman, a Wiccan priest­\ness, and a Baha’i minister appeared at meetings), the\nTown resumed its practice of inviting only clergy from\nneighboring Protestant and Catholic churches. See App.\n129a–143a. About two-thirds of the prayers given over\nthis decade or so invoked “Jesus,” “Christ,” “Your Son,” or\n“the Holy Spirit”; in the 18 months before the record\nclosed, 85% included those references. See generally id.,\nat 27a–143a. Many prayers contained elaborations of\nChristian doctrine or recitations of scripture. See, e.g., id.,\n\f                     Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)                  15\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nat 129a (“And in the life and death, resurrection and\nascension of the Savior Jesus Christ, the full extent of\nyour kindness shown to the unworthy is forever demon­\nstrated”); id., at 94a (“For unto us a child is born; unto us\na son is given. And the government shall be upon his\nshoulder . . .”). And the prayers usually close with phrases\nlike “in the name of Jesus Christ” or “in the name of Your\nson.” See, e.g., id., at 55a, 65a, 73a, 85a.\n   Still more, the prayers betray no understanding that the\nAmerican community is today, as it long has been, a rich\nmosaic of religious faiths. See Braunfeld v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106251\"><a href=\"/opinion/106251/braunfeld-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606 (1961) (plurality opinion) (recognizing even\nhalf a century ago that “we are a cosmopolitan nation\nmade up of people of almost every conceivable religious\npreference”). The monthly chaplains appear almost al­\nways to assume that everyone in the room is Christian\n(and of a kind who has no objection to government­\nsponsored worship4). The Town itself has never urged its\nchaplains to reach out to members of other faiths, or even\nto recall that they might be present. And accordingly, few\nchaplains have made any effort to be inclusive; none has\nthought even to assure attending members of the public\nthat they need not participate in the prayer session.\nIndeed, as the majority forthrightly recognizes, see ante,\nat 17, when the plaintiffs here began to voice concern over\nprayers that excluded some Town residents, one pastor\npointedly thanked the Board “[o]n behalf of all God-fearing\npeople” for holding fast, and another declared the objectors\n“in the minority and . . . ignorant of the history of our\ncountry.” App. 137a, 108a.\n——————\n  4 Leaders of several Baptist and other Christian congregations have\n\nexplained to the Court that “many Christians believe . . . that their\nfreedom of conscience is violated when they are pressured to participate\nin government prayer, because such acts of worship should only be\nperformed voluntarily.” Brief for Baptist Joint Committee for Religious\nLiberty et al. as Amici Curiae 18.\n\f16            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n                              C\n   Those three differences, taken together, remove this\ncase from the protective ambit of Marsh and the history on\nwhich it relied. To recap: Marsh upheld prayer addressed\nto legislators alone, in a proceeding in which citizens had\nno role—and even then, only when it did not “proselytize\nor advance” any single religion. 463 U. S., at 794. It was\nthat legislative prayer practice (not every prayer in a body\nexercising any legislative function) that the Court found\nconstitutional given its “unambiguous and unbroken\nhistory.” Id., at 792. But that approved practice, as I have\nshown, is not Greece’s. None of the history Marsh cited—\nand none the majority details today—supports calling on\ncitizens to pray, in a manner consonant with only a single\nreligion’s beliefs, at a participatory public proceeding,\nhaving both legislative and adjudicative components. Or\nto use the majority’s phrase, no “history shows that th[is]\nspecific practice is permitted.” Ante, at 8. And so, contra\nthe majority, Greece’s prayers cannot simply ride on the\nconstitutional coattails of the legislative tradition Marsh\ndescribed. The Board’s practice must, in its own particu­\nlars, meet constitutional requirements.\n   And the guideposts for addressing that inquiry include\nthe principles of religious neutrality I discussed earlier.\nSee supra, at 4–8. The government (whether federal,\nstate, or local) may not favor, or align itself with, any\nparticular creed. And that is nowhere more true than\nwhen officials and citizens come face to face in their\nshared institutions of governance. In performing civic\nfunctions and seeking civic benefits, each person of this\nnation must experience a government that belongs to one\nand all, irrespective of belief. And for its part, each gov­\nernment must ensure that its participatory processes will\nnot classify those citizens by faith, or make relevant their\nreligious differences.\n   To decide how Greece fares on that score, think again\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nabout how its prayer practice works, meeting after meet­\ning. The case, I think, has a fair bit in common with my\nearlier hypotheticals. See supra, at 2–4, 7. Let’s say that\na Muslim citizen of Greece goes before the Board to share\nher views on policy or request some permit. Maybe she\nwants the Board to put up a traffic light at a dangerous\nintersection; or maybe she needs a zoning variance to\nbuild an addition on her home. But just before she gets to\nsay her piece, a minister deputized by the Town asks her\nto pray “in the name of God’s only son Jesus Christ.” App.\n99a. She must think—it is hardly paranoia, but only the\ntruth—that Christian worship has become entwined with\nlocal governance. And now she faces a choice—to pray\nalongside the majority as one of that group or somehow to\nregister her deeply felt difference. She is a strong person,\nbut that is no easy call—especially given that the room is\nsmall and her every action (or inaction) will be noticed.\nShe does not wish to be rude to her neighbors, nor does\nshe wish to aggravate the Board members whom she will\nsoon be trying to persuade. And yet she does not want to\nacknowledge Christ’s divinity, any more than many of her\nneighbors would want to deny that tenet. So assume she\ndeclines to participate with the others in the first act of\nthe meeting—or even, as the majority proposes, that she\nstands up and leaves the room altogether, see ante, at 21.\nAt the least, she becomes a different kind of citizen, one\nwho will not join in the religious practice that the Town\nBoard has chosen as reflecting its own and the communi­\nty’s most cherished beliefs. And she thus stands at a\nremove, based solely on religion, from her fellow citizens\nand her elected representatives.\n   Everything about that situation, I think, infringes the\nFirst Amendment. (And of course, as I noted earlier, it\nwould do so no less if the Town’s clergy always used the\nliturgy of some other religion. See supra, at 4–5.) That\nthe Town Board selects, month after month and year after\n\f18            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nyear, prayergivers who will reliably speak in the voice of\nChristianity, and so places itself behind a single creed.\nThat in offering those sectarian prayers, the Board’s cho­\nsen clergy members repeatedly call on individuals, prior to\nparticipating in local governance, to join in a form of wor­\nship that may be at odds with their own beliefs. That the\nclergy thus put some residents to the unenviable choice of\neither pretending to pray like the majority or declining to\njoin its communal activity, at the very moment of petition­\ning their elected leaders. That the practice thus divides\nthe citizenry, creating one class that shares the Board’s\nown evident religious beliefs and another (far smaller)\nclass that does not. And that the practice also alters a\ndissenting citizen’s relationship with her government,\nmaking her religious difference salient when she seeks\nonly to engage her elected representatives as would any\nother citizen.\n   None of this means that Greece’s town hall must be\nreligion- or prayer-free. “[W]e are a religious people,”\nMarsh observed, 463 U. S., at 792, and prayer draws some\nwarrant from tradition in a town hall, as well as in Con­\ngress or a state legislature, see supra, at 8–9. What the\ncircumstances here demand is the recognition that we are\na pluralistic people too. When citizens of all faiths come\nto speak to each other and their elected representatives\nin a legislative session, the government must take espe-\ncial care to ensure that the prayers they hear will seek\nto include, rather than serve to divide. No more is\nrequired—but that much is crucial—to treat every citizen,\nof whatever religion, as an equal participant in her\ngovernment.\n   And contrary to the majority’s (and JUSTICE ALITO’s)\nview, see ante, at 13–14; ante, at 4–7, that is not difficult\nto do.

(Such prayers\nshow that “those of different creeds are in the end kindred\nspirits, united by a respect paid higher providence and by\na belief in the importance of religious faith”). Priests and\nministers, rabbis and imams give such invocations all the\ntime; there is no great mystery to the project. (And\nproviding that guidance would hardly have caused the\nBoard to run afoul of the idea that “[t]he First Amendment\nis not a majority rule,” as the Court (headspinningly)\nsuggests, ante, at 14; what does that is the Board’s refusal\nto reach out to members of minority religious groups.) Or\nif the Board preferred, it might have invited clergy of\nmany faiths to serve as chaplains, as the majority notes\nthat Congress does. See ante, at 10–11. When one month\na clergy member refers to Jesus, and the next to Allah or\nJehovah—as the majority hopefully though counterfactu­\nally suggests happened here, see ante, at 10–11, 15—the\ngovernment does not identify itself with one religion or\nalign itself with that faith’s citizens, and the effect of even\nsectarian prayer is transformed. So Greece had multiple\nways of incorporating prayer into its town meetings—\nreflecting all the ways that prayer (as most of us know\nfrom daily life) can forge common bonds, rather than\ndivide. See also ante, at 4 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n   But Greece could not do what it did: infuse a participa­\ntory government body with one (and only one) faith, so\nthat month in and month out, the citizens appearing\nbefore it become partly defined by their creed—as those\nwho share, and those who do not, the community’s major-\nity religious belief. In this country, when citizens go before\nthe government, they go not as Christians or Muslims or\nJews (or what have you), but just as Americans (or here,\nas Grecians). That is what it means to be an equal citizen,\nirrespective of religion. And that is what the Town of\nGreece precluded by so identifying itself with a single\n\f20            TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nfaith.\n                              III\n   How, then, does the majority go so far astray, allowing\nthe Town of Greece to turn its assemblies for citizens into\na forum for Christian prayer? The answer does not lie in\nfirst principles: I have no doubt that every member of this\nCourt believes as firmly as I that our institutions of gov­\nernment belong equally to all, regardless of faith. Rather,\nthe error reflects two kinds of blindness. First, the major-\nity misapprehends the facts of this case, as distinct from\nthose characterizing traditional legislative prayer. And\nsecond, the majority misjudges the essential meaning of\nthe religious worship in Greece’s town hall, along with its\ncapacity to exclude and divide.\n   The facts here matter to the constitutional issue; in-\ndeed, the majority itself acknowledges that the requisite\ninquiry—a “fact-sensitive” one—turns on “the setting in\nwhich the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is\ndirected.” Ante, at 19. But then the majority glides right\nover those considerations—at least as they relate to the\nTown of Greece. When the majority analyzes the “setting”\nand “audience” for prayer, it focuses almost exclusively on\nCongress and the Nebraska Legislature, see ante, at 6–8,\n10–11, 15–16, 19–20; it does not stop to analyze how far\nthose factors differ in Greece’s meetings. The majority\nthus gives short shrift to the gap—more like, the chasm—\nbetween a legislative floor session involving only elected\nofficials and a town hall revolving around ordinary citi­\nzens. And similarly the majority neglects to consider how\nthe prayers in Greece are mostly addressed to members of\nthe public, rather than (as in the forums it discusses) to\nthe lawmakers. “The District Court in Marsh,” the major­\nity expounds, “described the prayer exercise as ‘an inter­\nnal act’ directed at the Nebraska Legislature’s ‘own mem­\nbers.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting Chambers v. Marsh, 504\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)           21\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nF. Supp., at 588); see ante, at 20 (similarly noting that\nNebraska senators “invoke[d] spiritual inspiration entirely\nfor their own benefit” and that prayer in Congress is “reli­\ngious worship for national representatives” only). Well,\nyes, so it is in Lincoln, and on Capitol Hill. But not in\nGreece, where as I have described, the chaplain faces the\nTown’s residents—with the Board watching from on\nhigh—and calls on them to pray together. See supra, at\n10, 12.\n   And of course—as the majority sidesteps as well—to\npray in the name of Jesus Christ. In addressing the sec­\ntarian content of these prayers, the majority again chang­\nes the subject, preferring to explain what happens in other\ngovernment bodies. The majority notes, for example, that\nCongress “welcom[es] ministers of many creeds,” who\ncommonly speak of “values that count as universal,” ante,\nat 11, 15; and in that context, the majority opines, the fact\n“[t]hat a prayer is given in the name of Jesus, Allah, or\nJehovah . . . does not remove it from” Marsh’s protection,\nsee ante, at 15. But that case is not this one, as I have\nshown, because in Greece only Christian clergy members\nspeak, and then mostly in the voice of their own religion;\nno Allah or Jehovah ever is mentioned. See supra, at 13–\n14. So all the majority can point to in the Town’s practice\nis that the Board “maintains a policy of nondiscrimina­\ntion,” and “represent[s] that it would welcome a prayer by\nany minister or layman who wishe[s] to give one.” Ante, at\n17–18. But that representation has never been publicized;\nnor has the Board (except for a few months surrounding\nthis suit’s filing) offered the chaplain’s role to any non-\nChristian clergy or layman, in either Greece or its envi­\nrons; nor has the Board ever provided its chaplains with\nguidance about reaching out to members of other faiths, as\nmost state legislatures and Congress do.

Unlike those models, the Board is\ndeterminedly—and relentlessly—noninclusive.5\n   And the month in, month out sectarianism the Board\nchose for its meetings belies the majority’s refrain that the\nprayers in Greece were “ceremonial” in nature.

Ceremonial references to the divine surely\nabound: The majority is right that “the Pledge of Alle­\ngiance, inaugural prayer, or the recitation of ‘God save the\nUnited States and this honorable Court’ ” each fits the bill.\nAnte, at 19. But prayers evoking “the saving sacrifice of\nJesus Christ on the cross,” “the plan of redemption that is\nfulfilled in Jesus Christ,” “the life and death, resurrection\nand ascension of the Savior Jesus Christ,” the workings of\nthe Holy Spirit, the events of Pentecost, and the belief that\nGod “has raised up the Lord Jesus” and “will raise us, in\nour turn, and put us by His side”? See App. 56a, 88a–89a,\n99a, 123a, 129a, 134a. No. These are statements of pro­\nfound belief and deep meaning, subscribed to by many,\ndenied by some. They “speak of the depths of [one’s] life,\nof the source of [one’s] being, of [one’s] ultimate concern, of\nwhat [one] take[s] seriously without any reservation.” P.\n——————\n   5 JUSTICE ALITO similarly falters in attempting to excuse the Town\n\nBoard’s constant sectarianism. His concurring opinion takes great\npains to show that the problem arose from a sort of bureaucratic glitch:\nThe Town’s clerks, he writes, merely “did a bad job in compiling the\nlist” of chaplains. Ante, at 6; see ante, at 1–3. Now I suppose one\nquestion that account raises is why in over a decade, no member of the\nBoard noticed that the clerk’s list was producing prayers of only one\nkind. But put that aside. Honest oversight or not, the problem re­\nmains: Every month for more than a decade, the Board aligned itself,\nthrough its prayer practices, with a single religion. That the concurring\nopinion thinks my objection to that is “really quite niggling,” ante, at 4,\nsays all there is to say about the difference between our respective\nviews.\n\f                 Cite as: 572 U.

If they\n(and the central tenets of other religions) ever become\nmere ceremony, this country will be a fundamentally\ndifferent—and, I think, poorer—place to live.\n   But just for that reason, the not-so-implicit message of\nthe majority’s opinion—“What’s the big deal, anyway?”—is\nmistaken. The content of Greece’s prayers is a big deal, to\nChristians and non-Christians alike. A person’s response\nto the doctrine, language, and imagery contained in those\ninvocations reveals a core aspect of identity—who that\nperson is and how she faces the world. And the responses\nof different individuals, in Greece and across this country,\nof course vary. Contrary to the majority’s apparent view,\nsuch sectarian prayers are not “part of our expressive\nidiom” or “part of our heritage and tradition,” assuming\nthe word “our” refers to all Americans. Ante, at 19. They\nexpress beliefs that are fundamental to some, foreign to\nothers—and because that is so they carry the ever-present\npotential to both exclude and divide.

Mastromarino ed.\n1996). The first phrase there is the more poetic: a gov­\nernment that to “bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution\nno assistance.” But the second is actually the more star­\ntling and transformative: a government that, beyond not\naiding persecution, grants “immunities of citizenship” to\nthe Christian and the Jew alike, and makes them “equal\nparts” of the whole country.\n   Washington responded the very next day. Like any\nsuccessful politician, he appreciated a great line when he\nsaw one—and knew to borrow it too. And so he repeated,\nword for word, Seixas’s phrase about neither sanctioning\nbigotry nor assisting persecution. But he no less embraced\nthe point Seixas had made about equality of citizenship.\n“It is now no more,” Washington said, “that toleration is\nspoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of\npeople” to another, lesser one. For “[a]ll possess alike . . .\nimmunities of citizenship.” Letter to Newport Hebrew\nCongregation (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 PGW 285.
