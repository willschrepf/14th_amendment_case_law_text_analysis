The district\ncourt denied Warden Michael Upshaw’s motion for summary judgment because\nit concluded there were facts to support that Upshaw, through his failure to\ntrain and supervise his staff, was deliberately indifferent to inmate Michael\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 11-20628    Document: 00512162562     Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/04/2013\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-20628\nDewayne Walker’s right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. We\nreverse.\n                                        I\n      Plaintiffs–Appellees Mary Walker and Michael Spencer (Plaintiffs) filed\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 individually and as personal representatives of the\nestate of their son, Michael Dewayne Walker (Walker), for Walker’s alleged\nwrongful death while in custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\n(TDCJ). Walker was serving a twenty-year prison sentence after being convicted\nfor aggravated sexual assault of a child and was assigned to the TDCJ’s\nFerguson Unit in Midway, Texas. Walker was placed in a cell with Wilber\n“Peanut” Hamilton (Hamilton). In the early morning hours the following day,\nWalker was pronounced dead after having been stomped and kicked to death by\nHamilton.\n      Plaintiffs sued the TDCJ, supervisory officials, and correctional officers\nalleging that their failure to protect Walker resulted in his wrongful death.\nInitially, Plaintiffs advanced multiple theories of recovery including violations\nof Walker’s rights under the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments. After multiple pretrial motions, the only remaining claims are\nagainst three correctional officers on duty the night Walker died and Appellant\nMichael Upshaw (Upshaw) for their alleged violation of Walker’s Eighth\nAmendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Upshaw was\nthe warden at the Ferguson Unit when Walker was killed. Plaintiffs contend\nthat Walker’s death was caused by, among other things, Upshaw’s failure to\ntrain and supervise the correctional officers and his failure to enforce or adopt\nadequate policies to ensure Walker’s safety.\n      Upshaw and other defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based\non qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion. It held that\n“significant factual issues prevent a determination that the supervisors’ conduct\n\n                                       2\n\f     Case: 11-20628      Document: 00512162562         Page: 3     Date Filed: 03/04/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-20628\nwas objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law” and determined\nthat Plaintiffs were entitled to more discovery on the issue. The district court\nalso held that “because genuine issues of material fact remain concerning the\ndeficient policies implemented and enforced at the Ferguson Unit . . . , the\nsupervisory officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.”\n       Upshaw, along with the other defendants, filed an interlocutory appeal of\nthe denial. This court dismissed a portion of Plaintiffs’ complaint against\nseveral parties and remanded so that Upshaw and two correctional officers who\nwere on duty at the time of Walker’s death could “be deposed to determine\nwhether they had an actual subjective awareness of the danger to Walker and\nif so, whether they were deliberately indifferent to that danger of which they\nwere actually subjectively aware.”\n       After Upshaw was deposed, he filed a second motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity. Again, the district court denied his\nmotion. The district court held that it was “unclear whether [Upshaw] failed to\nadequately train the prison staff under his supervision” and noted that\n“plaintiffs have offered expert testimony that Upshaw failed to adequately train\nand supervise his staff.” Though claims remain pending against the correctional\nofficers, only Upshaw is a party to this appeal.\n                                            II\n       “The denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified\nimmunity is immediately appealable notwithstanding that such denial was\npremised upon the existence of ‘[m]aterial issues of fact.’”1 “We determine\nwhether a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Thompson v.

Even accepting all of Plaintiffs’ evidence as true and\nconsidering it as a whole, the facts do not support a finding of Upshaw’s\ndeliberate indifference.\n      The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, reflects\nthat Hamilton had a history of violence, attempted to kill another cellmate the\nsame way he used his prison-issued boots to kill Walker, and was in\nadministrative segregation for over six years. Hamilton’s fear of other inmates\nwas documented in his files. Plaintiffs also offered evidence that other inmates\nand prison administrators knew of and reported Hamilton’s history of assaulting\ncellmates. One inmate testified that it would take no more than thirty or forty\nminutes for a fight to break out after Hamilton received a cellmate. After such\na fight, the prison staff would segregate Hamilton for fifteen days, return him\nto a cell with another cellmate, and the process would repeat again. Conversely,\nthese same inmates reported Walker as being “laid back” and “stay[ing] to\nhimself.” Evidence further suggests that Walker would have been classified as\n“vulnerable” under the Safe Prisons Program. Finally, inmates testified that\nthere were several empty cells on the 3 Row of B Block, meaning it was\nunnecessary to put Hamilton and Walker in the same cell.\n      As for the night of the attack, Plaintiffs offered evidence that Hamilton\nwarned the staff that “violence is going to happen” and that Hamilton told\nofficers, “If you put him in here, I’m going to kill him.” There is also evidence\n\n\n      7\n          Id. at 456.\n      8\n          Id. (citing Behrens, 516 U.S. at 842).\n\n                                                   5\n\f    Case: 11-20628     Document: 00512162562     Page: 6   Date Filed: 03/04/2013\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-20628\nthat Walker was crying for help for at least three hours and that no guards\nchecked on him during this time. After the attack, an inmate testified that one\nof Upshaw’s subordinates encouraged inmates to change their reports of the\nincident to state that a guard or rover completed his round every fifteen minutes\nthat night to “make it look good for her behalf and her officers.”\n      As for prison conditions, the row on which Hamilton and Walker were\nhoused had no air conditioning and was farthest from the fans, making it the\nhottest area of the unit in July. Upshaw testified that he was unaware of a\npolicy requiring inmates such as Hamilton, who may have been taking\npsychotropic medication, to be housed in areas that would not be as hot as the\n3 Row of B Block. Further, a guard testified that Ferguson was known as a\n“gladiator” prison for being a “rough unit.”\n      All parties agree that Upshaw had no actual, subjective knowledge of\nWalker’s situation on the night of his death. In fact, the undisputed evidence\nreveals that Upshaw was at home in bed the night of Walker’s death. With\nrespect to policies, Upshaw testified that as senior warden of the Ferguson Unit,\nhe was responsible for the “overall operation of the facility, all aspects of it.”\nWhen asked about the boots Hamilton wore, Upshaw explained that while soft,\ncanvas shoes—as opposed to the work boots Hamilton had—are available, they\nare usually only an option for inmates in administrative segregation. Upshaw\nalso stated, “I’ve had a lot of inmate assaults where shoes or boots, even tennis\nshoes, were used; but none . . . that resulted in the death of an offender.”\n      Plaintiffs submitted an expert report by Charles Montgomery, which\nconcluded that Upshaw, as the primary policymaker overseeing the Ferguson\nUnit, “failed to ensure that the necessary steps were taken insofar as the\nsupervision, training, and/or discipline of guards” and that “Upshaw’s deposition\ntestimony regarding [his handling of threats against cell mates was] utterly\npreposterous.” Plaintiffs rely on this expert report to contend that Upshaw’s\n\n                                        6\n\f     Case: 11-20628             Document: 00512162562           Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/04/2013\n\n\n\n                                              No. 11-20628\npolicy of handling an inmate’s threat against another inmate was to take\ninvestigative and corrective measures for a specific threat but not if the threat\nwas more general.\n                                                    III\n          The doctrine of qualified immunity grants “government officials\nperforming discretionary functions” a shield from liability for civil damages as\nlong “as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”9 “The\nfirst step in the qualified immunity analysis is to determine whether the\nplaintiff has alleged the violation of a clearly established federal constitutional\n. . . right.”10 An official need not demonstrate that he did not violate clearly\nestablished federal rights; this burden is placed upon the plaintiffs.11 Once the\nplaintiff has discharged that burden, “the Court must then assess whether the\ndefendant’s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of clearly established\nlaw.”12\n          It is well established that “prison officials have a duty . . . to\nprotect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.”13 “It is not,\nhowever, every injury suffered by one prisoner at the hands of another that\ntranslates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the\n\n\n          9\n         Estate of Davis, 406 F.3d at 380 (quoting Harlow v.

Plaintiffs make no attempt to show a pattern of Upshaw’s\nemployees failing to protect inmates. In fact, they acknowledge that “normally,\nthe rover on night patrol would come by every 15 to 20 minutes.” This suggests\nthat Upshaw’s training was usually effective but that his subordinates’ failure\nto make timely rounds the night Walker died played a significant role in\nWalker’s death. Plaintiffs instead focus on Hamilton’s violence and the fact that\nUpshaw, through his training and supervision of his employees, failed to prevent\nit. However, “mere proof that the injury could have been prevented if the officer\nhad received better or additional training cannot, without more, support\nliability.”33\n       The Supreme Court has acknowledged that “in a narrow range of\ncircumstances, a pattern of similar violations might not be necessary to show\ndeliberate indifference.”34        In so acknowledging, the Court discussed the\nhypothetical posed in City of Canton v.

We\nreverse.\n                                        I\n      Plaintiffs–Appellees Mary Walker and Michael Spencer (Plaintiffs) filed\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 individually and as personal representatives of the\nestate of their son, Michael Dewayne Walker (Walker), for Walker’s alleged\nwrongful death while in custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\n(TDCJ). Walker was serving a twenty-year prison sentence after being convicted\nfor aggravated sexual assault of a child and was assigned to the TDCJ’s\nFerguson Unit in Midway, Texas. Walker was placed in a cell with Wilber\n“Peanut” Hamilton (Hamilton). In the early morning hours the following day,\nWalker was pronounced dead after having been stomped and kicked to death by\nHamilton.\n      Plaintiffs sued the TDCJ, supervisory officials, and correctional officers\nalleging that their failure to protect Walker resulted in his wrongful death.\nInitially, Plaintiffs advanced multiple theories of recovery including violations\nof Walker’s rights under the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments. After multiple pretrial motions, the only remaining claims are\nagainst three correctional officers on duty the night Walker died and Appellant\nMichael Upshaw (Upshaw) for their alleged violation of Walker’s Eighth\nAmendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Upshaw was\nthe warden at the Ferguson Unit when Walker was killed. Plaintiffs contend\nthat Walker’s death was caused by, among other things, Upshaw’s failure to\ntrain and supervise the correctional officers and his failure to enforce or adopt\nadequate policies to ensure Walker’s safety.\n      Upshaw and other defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based\non qualified immunity. The district court denied the motion. It held that\n“significant factual issues prevent a determination that the supervisors’ conduct\n\n                                       2\n\f     Case: 11-20628      Document: 00512162562         Page: 3     Date Filed: 03/04/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-20628\nwas objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law” and determined\nthat Plaintiffs were entitled to more discovery on the issue. The district court\nalso held that “because genuine issues of material fact remain concerning the\ndeficient policies implemented and enforced at the Ferguson Unit . . . , the\nsupervisory officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.”\n       Upshaw, along with the other defendants, filed an interlocutory appeal of\nthe denial. This court dismissed a portion of Plaintiffs’ complaint against\nseveral parties and remanded so that Upshaw and two correctional officers who\nwere on duty at the time of Walker’s death could “be deposed to determine\nwhether they had an actual subjective awareness of the danger to Walker and\nif so, whether they were deliberately indifferent to that danger of which they\nwere actually subjectively aware.”\n       After Upshaw was deposed, he filed a second motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity. Again, the district court denied his\nmotion. The district court held that it was “unclear whether [Upshaw] failed to\nadequately train the prison staff under his supervision” and noted that\n“plaintiffs have offered expert testimony that Upshaw failed to adequately train\nand supervise his staff.” Though claims remain pending against the correctional\nofficers, only Upshaw is a party to this appeal.\n                                            II\n       “The denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified\nimmunity is immediately appealable notwithstanding that such denial was\npremised upon the existence of ‘[m]aterial issues of fact.’”1 “We determine\nwhether a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Thompson v.

Even accepting all of Plaintiffs’ evidence as true and\nconsidering it as a whole, the facts do not support a finding of Upshaw’s\ndeliberate indifference.\n      The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, reflects\nthat Hamilton had a history of violence, attempted to kill another cellmate the\nsame way he used his prison-issued boots to kill Walker, and was in\nadministrative segregation for over six years. Hamilton’s fear of other inmates\nwas documented in his files. Plaintiffs also offered evidence that other inmates\nand prison administrators knew of and reported Hamilton’s history of assaulting\ncellmates. One inmate testified that it would take no more than thirty or forty\nminutes for a fight to break out after Hamilton received a cellmate. After such\na fight, the prison staff would segregate Hamilton for fifteen days, return him\nto a cell with another cellmate, and the process would repeat again. Conversely,\nthese same inmates reported Walker as being “laid back” and “stay[ing] to\nhimself.” Evidence further suggests that Walker would have been classified as\n“vulnerable” under the Safe Prisons Program. Finally, inmates testified that\nthere were several empty cells on the 3 Row of B Block, meaning it was\nunnecessary to put Hamilton and Walker in the same cell.\n      As for the night of the attack, Plaintiffs offered evidence that Hamilton\nwarned the staff that “violence is going to happen” and that Hamilton told\nofficers, “If you put him in here, I’m going to kill him.” There is also evidence\n\n\n      7\n          Id. at 456.\n      8\n          Id.

After the attack, an inmate testified that one\nof Upshaw’s subordinates encouraged inmates to change their reports of the\nincident to state that a guard or rover completed his round every fifteen minutes\nthat night to “make it look good for her behalf and her officers.”\n      As for prison conditions, the row on which Hamilton and Walker were\nhoused had no air conditioning and was farthest from the fans, making it the\nhottest area of the unit in July. Upshaw testified that he was unaware of a\npolicy requiring inmates such as Hamilton, who may have been taking\npsychotropic medication, to be housed in areas that would not be as hot as the\n3 Row of B Block. Further, a guard testified that Ferguson was known as a\n“gladiator” prison for being a “rough unit.”\n      All parties agree that Upshaw had no actual, subjective knowledge of\nWalker’s situation on the night of his death. In fact, the undisputed evidence\nreveals that Upshaw was at home in bed the night of Walker’s death. With\nrespect to policies, Upshaw testified that as senior warden of the Ferguson Unit,\nhe was responsible for the “overall operation of the facility, all aspects of it.”\nWhen asked about the boots Hamilton wore, Upshaw explained that while soft,\ncanvas shoes—as opposed to the work boots Hamilton had—are available, they\nare usually only an option for inmates in administrative segregation. Upshaw\nalso stated, “I’ve had a lot of inmate assaults where shoes or boots, even tennis\nshoes, were used; but none . . . that resulted in the death of an offender.”\n      Plaintiffs submitted an expert report by Charles Montgomery, which\nconcluded that Upshaw, as the primary policymaker overseeing the Ferguson\nUnit, “failed to ensure that the necessary steps were taken insofar as the\nsupervision, training, and/or discipline of guards” and that “Upshaw’s deposition\ntestimony regarding [his handling of threats against cell mates was] utterly\npreposterous.” Plaintiffs rely on this expert report to contend that Upshaw’s\n\n                                        6\n\f     Case: 11-20628             Document: 00512162562           Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/04/2013\n\n\n\n                                              No. 11-20628\npolicy of handling an inmate’s threat against another inmate was to take\ninvestigative and corrective measures for a specific threat but not if the threat\nwas more general.\n                                                    III\n          The doctrine of qualified immunity grants “government officials\nperforming discretionary functions” a shield from liability for civil damages as\nlong “as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”9 “The\nfirst step in the qualified immunity analysis is to determine whether the\nplaintiff has alleged the violation of a clearly established federal constitutional\n. . . right.”10 An official need not demonstrate that he did not violate clearly\nestablished federal rights; this burden is placed upon the plaintiffs.11 Once the\nplaintiff has discharged that burden, “the Court must then assess whether the\ndefendant’s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of clearly established\nlaw.”12\n          It is well established that “prison officials have a duty . . . to\nprotect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.”13 “It is not,\nhowever, every injury suffered by one prisoner at the hands of another that\ntranslates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the\n\n\n          9\n         Estate of Davis, 406 F.3d at 380 (quoting Harlow v.

In fact, they acknowledge that “normally,\nthe rover on night patrol would come by every 15 to 20 minutes.” This suggests\nthat Upshaw’s training was usually effective but that his subordinates’ failure\nto make timely rounds the night Walker died played a significant role in\nWalker’s death.
