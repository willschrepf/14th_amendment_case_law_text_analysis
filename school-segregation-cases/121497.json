On\nappeal Navejar argues that the court erred by refusing\nto recruit counsel for him. Because the court applied\nthe wrong legal standard to Navejar’s motion, and the\nlack of counsel prejudiced him, we reverse.\n  We assume that the following factual allegations of\nthe complaint are true and draw all possible inferences\nin favor of Navejar. Biblia Abierta v. Banks, 129 F.3d 899,\n902 (7th Cir. 1997). Navejar was imprisoned in State-\nville Correctional Center in 2008. One evening while\nproceeding to the cafeteria, Navejar spoke to other\ninmates in their cells. Akinola Iyiola, a lieutenant at the\nprison, ordered him to get out of the cafeteria line\nbecause prison rules forbid inmates, while being trans-\nported, from stopping to speak to other inmates. Navejar\ndisobeyed the order, became belligerent, and punched\nIyiola. Other guards soon converged on the scene to\nassist Iyiola, and they wrestled Navejar to the ground\nwhere he was soon handcuffed.\n  Navejar described in an affidavit and at his deposi-\ntion the force that guards used after they handcuffed and\nsubdued him. He testified that Iyiola kicked him in\nthe forehead near his eye, and an unidentified guard\nstomped his head against the ground. Next another\nguard, Sergeant Michael Grant, pepper-sprayed Navejar.\n\fNo. 12-1182                                            3\n\nGuards then dragged Navejar along the floor and\ncarried him down some stairs where Iyiola sprayed\nmore pepper spray in Navejar’s face. Guards then\nleft Navejar alone for a half-hour in a segregation cell,\nwhile he screamed in pain, before he was allowed to\nwash off the pepper spray.\n  The next morning a guard brought Navejar to State-\nville’s health care unit, where nurses examined him.\nBut before a doctor could provide medical attention,\nLieutenant Glen Elberson escorted Navejar out of the\nhealth care facility, explaining that he was being trans-\nferred to Pontiac Correctional Center. That afternoon at\nPontiac, Navejar was examined by a physician, who\nconcluded, after administering X-rays, that he had\nsuffered only bruises and scratches.\n  Prison officials investigated the clash between Navejar\nand Iyiola and charged Navejar with four disciplinary\nviolations: assaulting prison staff, creating a dangerous\ndisturbance, insolence, and disobeying an order, all\nof which he denied. After a hearing, the disciplinary\nboard found Navejar guilty. It concluded that Navejar\nstarted the physical altercation when he “suddenly\nswung” at Iyiola and that Iyiola was “hit on the nose\nand upper lip” during the ensuing fight. Among other\npunishments, the board revoked one year of good time\ncredits. Navejar appealed the ruling and submitted a\ngrievance accusing the guards of using excessive force.\nHe lost both the appeal and the grievance.\n Navejar then sued Iyiola, Grant, Elberson, and other\nunnamed prison guards in federal court, alleging that\n\f4                                                No. 12-1182\n\nthe guards used excessive force and were deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment. See 42 U.S.C. § 1983. (He also\nbrought a claim, no longer pursued, that the discipline\nviolated his right to due process.) During discovery,\nthe defendants produced a few documents “as a cour-\ntesy” to Navejar. But they refused Navejar’s other\nrequests, including his request for more documents\nabout or recordings of the altercation, citing security\nrisks and burden.\n  Navejar moved four times for the recruitment of\npro bono counsel. He filed two of his motions at the start\nof the case, another after the guards moved to dismiss\nhis due-process claim, and a fourth after they moved\nfor summary judgment. His motions asserted why he\nbelieved he was incapable of representing himself: he\ndid not finish high school, he suffered from (an unspeci-\nfied) mental illness, he had difficulty with English, he\nhad repeatedly been moved from prison to prison and\nthus had trouble securing help for his case, and he had\nbeen denied access to the law library during prison\nlockdowns. Navejar’s first two motions did not assert\nthat he had sought counsel on his own; the district court\nnever ruled on these motions. The third and fourth mo-\ntions, though, explained that Navejar had contacted\nattorneys to represent him. The court denied these\ntwo motions.\n  But the court denied the latter two motions without\nciting Pruitt v. Mote, 503 F.3d 647 (7th Cir. 2007) (en banc),\nand instead relied on older cases in brief minute orders.\n\fNo. 12-1182                                              5\n\nIt began by applying the legal standard in Gil v.\nReed, 381 F.3d 649, 656 (7th Cir. 2004), in evaluating\n(1) whether the plaintiff appears competent “to try” the\ncase himself, and (2) whether recruiting counsel “would\nprovide a substantial benefit to the court or the parties,\npotentially affecting the outcome.” The court concluded\nthat counsel was unnecessary in Navejar’s case because\nhe “alleged no physical or mental disability” pre-\ncluding him from investigating the facts of his case and\n“[n]either the legal issues raised in the complaint nor\nthe evidence that might support Plaintiff’s claims are so\ncomplex or intricate that a trained attorney is necessary.”\n  The district court granted summary judgment for the\nprison guards. The court struck Navejar’s statement of\nmaterial facts and deemed admitted the defendants’\nstatement, reasoning that Navejar had committed two\ncritical errors: (1) impermissibly attempting to create\na fact dispute by citing “self-serving evidence”—his\naffidavit where he asserted that guards beat and pepper-\nsprayed him after he was cuffed and subdued; and\n(2) adding his own factual assertions in response to\nthe defendants’ statement of facts, rather than pre-\nsenting them in a separate statement, as required by\nN.D. ILL. L. R. 56.1(b)(3)(C). With the defendant’s version\nof events uncontradicted, the court concluded that no\nreasonable jury could determine that the guards used\nexcessive force against Navejar. Alternatively, the court\nreasoned, Navejar’s excessive-force claim was barred\nby Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994), because\nthe prison disciplinary board found Navejar guilty of\nassaulting Iyiola. Finally, the court concluded that\n\f6                                               No. 12-1182\n\nNavejar could not recover for deliberate indifference\nagainst Elberson because no evidence suggested that\nNavejar suffered from a serious medical condition or\nthat Elberson had a culpable mental state. (The district\ncourt’s treatment of deliberate indifference was clearly\ncorrect, so we say nothing further about it.)\n   Navejar makes only one argument on appeal: that\nthe district court abused its discretion by failing to\nrecruit him a lawyer. In a civil case, the court has dis-\ncretion to recruit counsel to represent a litigant who is\nunable to afford one. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); Ray v. Wexford\nHealth Sources, Inc., 706 F.3d 864, 866-67 (7th Cir. 2013).\nIn Pruitt we refined the standards for evaluating\nwhether to recruit counsel. If a plaintiff makes a rea-\nsonable attempt to secure counsel, the court must\nexamine “whether the difficulty of the case—factually and\nlegally—exceeds the particular plaintiff’s capacity as a\nlayperson to coherently present it.” Pruitt, 503 F.3d at\n655. This inquiry does not focus solely on the plain-\ntiff’s ability to try his case—it also includes other\n“tasks that normally attend litigation” such as “evidence\ngathering” and “preparing and responding to motions.”\nId. When ruling on a motion to recruit counsel, the\ncourt should take account of all evidence in the record\nrelevant to the plaintiff’s capacity to litigate. Id. We\nwill overturn the district court’s decision only when\nthe court has abused its discretion based on the\nevidence in the record when it ruled on the motion. Id.\nat 658-59. And even if the district court abuses its dis-\ncretion, we will reverse only if the plaintiff shows\nprejudice—“a reasonable likelihood that the presence\n\fNo. 12-1182                                                 7\n\nof counsel would have made a difference in the outcome\nof the litigation.” Id. at 659 (emphasis removed).\n  In its orders denying Navejar’s § 1915(e)(1) motions,\nthe court erred in three ways. First, by relying on Gil\ninstead of Pruitt, the court believed that it should decide\nwhether Navejar was competent to try his case. See Gil,\n381 F.3d at 656. But Pruitt clarified that the proper\ninquiry focuses on “whether the plaintiff appears com-\npetent to litigate his own claims,” 503 F.3d at 655\n(emphasis in original), with tactics like discovery and\nmotion practice “that normally attend litigation.” Id.\nSecond, by stating without elaboration that Navejar’s\nclaims are not “so complex or intricate that a trained\nattorney is necessary,” the district court resurrected\nboilerplate language that we disapproved of in Pruitt\nbecause it ignores the plaintiff’s abilities. Id. at 649, 660.\nAlthough the court briefly referred to Navejar’s compe-\ntence, stating that Navejar “alleged no physical or\nmental disability,” the record contradicts its statement.\nNavejar stressed his limited education, mental illness,\nlanguage difficulties, and lack of access to fellow\nprisoners or other resources for assistance after his\ntransfer from Stateville. See also ILL. A DMIN. C ODE tit. 20,\n§ 701.180(a) (restricting mail correspondence between\ninmates in different prisons). Third, the court asked\nwhether recruiting counsel would substantially benefit\n“the court or the parties, potentially affecting the out-\ncome.” But in Pruitt, we distinguished the district\ncourt’s inquiry from the standard of appellate review.\nSee 503 F.3d at 654. Pruitt nowhere suggests that\na district court should consider whether recruiting\n\f8                                                 No. 12-1182\n\ncounsel would affect the outcome of a case; instead, that\ninquiry is reserved for the appellate court’s review for\nprejudice. See id. at 659. By applying the wrong legal\nstandard and failing to consider the record, the district\ncourt abused its discretion. See Bracey v. Grondin, No. 12-\n1644, 2013 WL 1007709, at *2 (7th Cir. Mar. 15, 2013);\nSantiago v. Walls, 599 F.3d 749, 765 (7th Cir. 2010);\nPruitt, 503 F.3d at 660.\n   The district court, unfortunately, is not alone in\nrelying on pre-Pruitt case law. Many other district judges\nin the Northern District of Illinois have recently and\nregularly issued substantially similar rulings. We have\nfound more than 100 rulings from the Northern District\nof Illinois since Pruitt using the phrase “so complex or\nintricate that a trained attorney is necessary.” See, e.g.,\nVelasquez v. Kane Cnty. Jail Adult Judicial Center, No. 13\nC 0644, 2013 WL 523827, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 11, 2013);\nAllen v. Wexford Health Sources, No. 12 C 50380, 2012 WL\n6587792, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 17, 2012); Birks v. Dart,\nNo. 12 C 7701, 2012 WL 5363439, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 30,\n2012). Some of these orders (like the one in this case) do not\ncite Pruitt or subsequent case law. See, e.g., Hutcherson v.\nCook Cnty., No. 10 C 6215, 2010 WL 3951897, at *2 (N.D. Ill.\nOct. 6, 2010); Banks v. Mills, No. 10 C 1486, 2010 WL\n3307356, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 19, 2010); Logan v. Godinez, No.\n10 C 4418, 2010 WL 2836957, at *3 (N.D. Ill. July 19, 2010).\nAnd these are only the rulings searchable through pub-\nlic databases; doubtless district judges have also used\nthis obsolete language in orders not captured in these\ndatabases. We therefore take this opportunity to remind\ndistrict courts about the individualized analysis that\n\fNo. 12-1182                                                9\n\nPruitt requires, see 503 F.3d at 655-56, and caution\nagainst using boilerplate language that we criticized\nen banc.\n   Even though the district court applied the wrong stan-\ndard, we will not reverse without a showing of preju-\ndice—a “reasonable likelihood that the presence of\ncounsel would have made a difference in the outcome\nof the litigation.” Id. at 659 (emphasis removed).\nPrejudice (unlike abuse of discretion) may be estab-\nlished by an after-the-fact review “of a litigant’s poor\nperformance before or during trial.” Id. at 659-60.\n  In this case, the absence of counsel likely prejudiced\nNavejar because the district court’s ruling on summary\njudgment reveals two substantive errors. First, the court\nadopted the erroneous legal argument raised by the\ndefendants in moving for summary judgment that\nNavejar could not rely on “self-serving evidence” to\ncreate a material factual dispute. This is wrong. “[W]e\nlong ago buried—or at least tried to bury—the miscon-\nception that uncorroborated testimony from the non-\nmovant cannot prevent summary judgment because it\nis ‘self-serving.’ ” Berry v. Chicago Transit Auth., 618 F.3d\n688, 691 (7th Cir. 2010); see also Darchak v. City of Chicago\nBd. of Educ., 580 F.3d 622, 631 (7th Cir. 2009); Buie v.\nQuad/Graphics, Inc., 366 F.3d 496, 504-06 (7th Cir. 2004);\nPayne v. Pauley, 337 F.3d 767, 770-73 (7th Cir. 2003). Here,\nNavejar attempted to present his side of the story at\nsummary judgment through his affidavits and specific\nreferences to his deposition testimony. He contended\nthat after he was subdued and handcuffed, Iyiola\n\f10                                             No. 12-1182\n\nkicked him in the face, a prison guard stomped his\nhead, guards dragged him across the floor, Grant and\nIyiola pepper-sprayed him, and then left him alone for\n30 minutes screaming in pain. With Navejar lacking\ncounsel to reply to the defendants’ erroneous con-\ntention that the district court may safely disregard\nhis “self-serving” evidence, the district court accepted\nthat contention and thereby prejudiced Navejar.\n  Second, the defendants argued that Navejar’s excessive-\nforce claim was Heck-barred because the prison board\nfound Navejar guilty of disobeying orders and as-\nsaulting Iyiola. See Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 648\n(1997); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994). The\ndistrict court again agreed with the guards, ruling\nthat Heck bars the excessive-force claim. We disagree,\nobserving as we have before that pro se prisoners are\noften tripped up by Heck’s complexities. See Evans v.\nPoskon, 603 F.3d 362, 364 (7th Cir. 2010); Gilbert v. Cook,\n512 F.3d 899, 901 (7th Cir. 2008). Navejar cannot deny\nthat he disobeyed orders or assaulted Iyiola because\nthose denials would “necessarily imply” the invalidity\nof his discipline. See Moore v. Mahone, 652 F.3d 722, 724-\n25 (7th Cir. 2011); Evans, 603 F.3d at 364; Gilbert, 512\nF.3d at 900. But Navejar’s assault on Iyiola is not neces-\nsarily inconsistent with his sworn contention that the\nguards answered his assault with excessive force\nafter they subdued him. See Gilbert, 512 F.3d at 901-\n02 (reversing Heck-based judgment as a matter of\nlaw against inmate, remanding for trial on inmate’s\nexcessive-force claim despite prison board finding that\ninmate punched guard, and ordering district court to\n\fNo. 12-1182                                            11\n\nconsider recruiting counsel); Skrtich v. Thornton, 280\nF.3d 1295, 1301-02, 1304-05 (11th Cir. 2002). “Otherwise\nguards (and for that matter any public employee)\ncould maul anyone who strikes them, without risk of civil\nliability as long as the private party is punished by\ncriminal prosecution or prison discipline for the initial\nwrong.” Gilbert, 512 F.3d at 901. Without a lawyer for\nNavejar to advocate the limits of Heck, the court\nmistakenly barred Navejar from arguing that, after he\nassaulted Iyiola, the guards responded with dispropor-\ntionate force. See Gilbert, 512 F.3d at 901-02.\n  Beyond these two errors, Navejar was also prej-\nudiced by proceeding without a lawyer after he was\ntransferred from Stateville. Like the plaintiff who was\ntransferred to a new prison in Santiago, once Navejar\nwas transferred, he faced “significant problems” in liti-\ngating pro se because, once at another institution, he\nwas not readily able to “identify key witnesses, depose\nthe defendants and gather pertinent evidence,” or\nproceed against John Doe defendants because he\ncouldn’t ascertain their identities. Santiago, 599 F.3d\nat 763, 766; see also Pruitt, 503 F.3d at 660. Navejar em-\nphasizes that he was restricted from corresponding\nwith individuals at Stateville, including those who\nmight have been witnesses to the brawl. See ILL. A DMIN.\nC ODE tit. 20, § 701.180(a). Aware of these limits, the\nnamed defendants avoided producing virtually every-\nthing he requested in discovery. Counsel would\nlikely not have faced the same obstacles. See Santiago,\n599 F.3d at 765.\n\f12                                            No. 12-1182\n\n  We conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat Navejar would have overcome summary judgment\nwith the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we R EVERSE\nthe grant of summary judgment on the excessive-force\nclaim and R EMAND for further proceedings consistent\nwith this order, including the recruitment of counsel\nfor Navejar. See Pruitt, 503 F.3d at 661. In all other re-\nspects the judgment is A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                          5-29-13\n\f",

Other guards soon converged on the scene to\nassist Iyiola, and they wrestled Navejar to the ground\nwhere he was soon handcuffed.\n  Navejar described in an affidavit and at his deposi-\ntion the force that guards used after they handcuffed and\nsubdued him. He testified that Iyiola kicked him in\nthe forehead near his eye, and an unidentified guard\nstomped his head against the ground. Next another\nguard, Sergeant Michael Grant, pepper-sprayed Navejar.\n\fNo. 12-1182                                            3\n\nGuards then dragged Navejar along the floor and\ncarried him down some stairs where Iyiola sprayed\nmore pepper spray in Navejar’s face. Guards then\nleft Navejar alone for a half-hour in a segregation cell,\nwhile he screamed in pain, before he was allowed to\nwash off the pepper spray.\n  The next morning a guard brought Navejar to State-\nville’s health care unit, where nurses examined him.\nBut before a doctor could provide medical attention,\nLieutenant Glen Elberson escorted Navejar out of the\nhealth care facility, explaining that he was being trans-\nferred to Pontiac Correctional Center. That afternoon at\nPontiac, Navejar was examined by a physician, who\nconcluded, after administering X-rays, that he had\nsuffered only bruises and scratches.\n  Prison officials investigated the clash between Navejar\nand Iyiola and charged Navejar with four disciplinary\nviolations: assaulting prison staff, creating a dangerous\ndisturbance, insolence, and disobeying an order, all\nof which he denied. After a hearing, the disciplinary\nboard found Navejar guilty. It concluded that Navejar\nstarted the physical altercation when he “suddenly\nswung” at Iyiola and that Iyiola was “hit on the nose\nand upper lip” during the ensuing fight. Among other\npunishments, the board revoked one year of good time\ncredits. Navejar appealed the ruling and submitted a\ngrievance accusing the guards of using excessive force.\nHe lost both the appeal and the grievance.\n Navejar then sued Iyiola, Grant, Elberson, and other\nunnamed prison guards in federal court, alleging that\n\f4                                                No. 12-1182\n\nthe guards used excessive force and were deliberately\nindifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of\nthe Eighth Amendment. See 42 U.S.C. § 1983. (He also\nbrought a claim, no longer pursued, that the discipline\nviolated his right to due process.) During discovery,\nthe defendants produced a few documents “as a cour-\ntesy” to Navejar. But they refused Navejar’s other\nrequests, including his request for more documents\nabout or recordings of the altercation, citing security\nrisks and burden.\n  Navejar moved four times for the recruitment of\npro bono counsel. He filed two of his motions at the start\nof the case, another after the guards moved to dismiss\nhis due-process claim, and a fourth after they moved\nfor summary judgment. His motions asserted why he\nbelieved he was incapable of representing himself: he\ndid not finish high school, he suffered from (an unspeci-\nfied) mental illness, he had difficulty with English, he\nhad repeatedly been moved from prison to prison and\nthus had trouble securing help for his case, and he had\nbeen denied access to the law library during prison\nlockdowns. Navejar’s first two motions did not assert\nthat he had sought counsel on his own; the district court\nnever ruled on these motions. The third and fourth mo-\ntions, though, explained that Navejar had contacted\nattorneys to represent him. The court denied these\ntwo motions.\n  But the court denied the latter two motions without\nciting Pruitt v. Mote, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1218369\"><a href=\"/opinion/1218369/pruitt-v-mote/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2007) (en banc),\nand instead relied on older cases in brief minute orders.\n\fNo. 12-1182                                              5\n\nIt began by applying the legal standard in Gil v.\nReed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787537\"><a href=\"/opinion/787537/diego-gil-v-james-reed-jaime-penaflor-and-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (7th Cir. 2004), in evaluating\n(1) whether the plaintiff appears competent “to try” the\ncase himself, and (2) whether recruiting counsel “would\nprovide a substantial benefit to the court or the parties,\npotentially affecting the outcome.” The court concluded\nthat counsel was unnecessary in Navejar’s case because\nhe “alleged no physical or mental disability” pre-\ncluding him from investigating the facts of his case and\n“[n]either the legal issues raised in the complaint nor\nthe evidence that might support Plaintiff’s claims are so\ncomplex or intricate that a trained attorney is necessary.”\n  The district court granted summary judgment for the\nprison guards. The court struck Navejar’s statement of\nmaterial facts and deemed admitted the defendants’\nstatement, reasoning that Navejar had committed two\ncritical errors: (1) impermissibly attempting to create\na fact dispute by citing “self-serving evidence”—his\naffidavit where he asserted that guards beat and pepper-\nsprayed him after he was cuffed and subdued; and\n(2) adding his own factual assertions in response to\nthe defendants’ statement of facts, rather than pre-\nsenting them in a separate statement, as required by\nN.D. ILL. L. R. 56.1(b)(3)(C). With the defendant’s version\nof events uncontradicted, the court concluded that no\nreasonable jury could determine that the guards used\nexcessive force against Navejar. Alternatively, the court\nreasoned, Navejar’s excessive-force claim was barred\nby Heck v. Humphrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1994), because\nthe prison disciplinary board found Navejar guilty of\nassaulting Iyiola. Finally, the court concluded that\n\f6                                               No. 12-1182\n\nNavejar could not recover for deliberate indifference\nagainst Elberson because no evidence suggested that\nNavejar suffered from a serious medical condition or\nthat Elberson had a culpable mental state. (The district\ncourt’s treatment of deliberate indifference was clearly\ncorrect, so we say nothing further about it.)\n   Navejar makes only one argument on appeal: that\nthe district court abused its discretion by failing to\nrecruit him a lawyer. In a civil case, the court has dis-\ncretion to recruit counsel to represent a litigant who is\nunable to afford one. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); Ray v. Wexford\nHealth Sources, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 866-67 (7th Cir. 2013).\nIn Pruitt we refined the standards for evaluating\nwhether to recruit counsel. If a plaintiff makes a rea-\nsonable attempt to secure counsel, the court must\nexamine “whether the difficulty of the case—factually and\nlegally—exceeds the particular plaintiff’s capacity as a\nlayperson to coherently present it.” Pruitt, 503 F.3d at\n655. This inquiry does not focus solely on the plain-\ntiff’s ability to try his case—it also includes other\n“tasks that normally attend litigation” such as “evidence\ngathering” and “preparing and responding to motions.”\nId. When ruling on a motion to recruit counsel, the\ncourt should take account of all evidence in the record\nrelevant to the plaintiff’s capacity to litigate. Id. We\nwill overturn the district court’s decision only when\nthe court has abused its discretion based on the\nevidence in the record when it ruled on the motion. Id.\nat 658-59. And even if the district court abuses its dis-\ncretion, we will reverse only if the plaintiff shows\nprejudice—“a reasonable likelihood that the presence\n\fNo. 12-1182                                                 7\n\nof counsel would have made a difference in the outcome\nof the litigation.” Id. at 659 (emphasis removed).\n  In its orders denying Navejar’s § 1915(e)(1) motions,\nthe court erred in three ways. First, by relying on Gil\ninstead of Pruitt, the court believed that it should decide\nwhether Navejar was competent to try his case. See Gil,\n381 F.3d at 656. But Pruitt clarified that the proper\ninquiry focuses on “whether the plaintiff appears com-\npetent to litigate his own claims,” 503 F.3d at 655\n(emphasis in original), with tactics like discovery and\nmotion practice “that normally attend litigation.” Id.\nSecond, by stating without elaboration that Navejar’s\nclaims are not “so complex or intricate that a trained\nattorney is necessary,” the district court resurrected\nboilerplate language that we disapproved of in Pruitt\nbecause it ignores the plaintiff’s abilities. Id. at 649, 660.\nAlthough the court briefly referred to Navejar’s compe-\ntence, stating that Navejar “alleged no physical or\nmental disability,” the record contradicts its statement.\nNavejar stressed his limited education, mental illness,\nlanguage difficulties, and lack of access to fellow\nprisoners or other resources for assistance after his\ntransfer from Stateville. See also ILL. A DMIN. C ODE tit. 20,\n§ 701.180(a) (restricting mail correspondence between\ninmates in different prisons). Third, the court asked\nwhether recruiting counsel would substantially benefit\n“the court or the parties, potentially affecting the out-\ncome.” But in Pruitt, we distinguished the district\ncourt’s inquiry from the standard of appellate review.\nSee 503 F.3d at 654. Pruitt nowhere suggests that\na district court should consider whether recruiting\n\f8                                                 No. 12-1182\n\ncounsel would affect the outcome of a case; instead, that\ninquiry is reserved for the appellate court’s review for\nprejudice. See id. at 659. By applying the wrong legal\nstandard and failing to consider the record, the district\ncourt abused its discretion. See Bracey v. Grondin, No. 12-\n1644, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1007709</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (7th Cir.

Many other district judges\nin the Northern District of Illinois have recently and\nregularly issued substantially similar rulings. We have\nfound more than 100 rulings from the Northern District\nof Illinois since Pruitt using the phrase “so complex or\nintricate that a trained attorney is necessary.” See, e.g.,\nVelasquez v. Kane Cnty. Jail Adult Judicial Center, No. 13\nC 0644, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">523827</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (N.D.

We therefore take this opportunity to remind\ndistrict courts about the individualized analysis that\n\fNo. 12-1182                                                9\n\nPruitt requires, see 503 F.3d at 655-56, and caution\nagainst using boilerplate language that we criticized\nen banc.\n   Even though the district court applied the wrong stan-\ndard, we will not reverse without a showing of preju-\ndice—a “reasonable likelihood that the presence of\ncounsel would have made a difference in the outcome\nof the litigation.” Id. at 659 (emphasis removed).\nPrejudice (unlike abuse of discretion) may be estab-\nlished by an after-the-fact review “of a litigant’s poor\nperformance before or during trial.” Id. at 659-60.\n  In this case, the absence of counsel likely prejudiced\nNavejar because the district court’s ruling on summary\njudgment reveals two substantive errors. First, the court\nadopted the erroneous legal argument raised by the\ndefendants in moving for summary judgment that\nNavejar could not rely on “self-serving evidence” to\ncreate a material factual dispute. This is wrong. “[W]e\nlong ago buried—or at least tried to bury—the miscon-\nception that uncorroborated testimony from the non-\nmovant cannot prevent summary judgment because it\nis ‘self-serving.’ ” Berry v.

Here,\nNavejar attempted to present his side of the story at\nsummary judgment through his affidavits and specific\nreferences to his deposition testimony. He contended\nthat after he was subdued and handcuffed, Iyiola\n\f10                                             No. 12-1182\n\nkicked him in the face, a prison guard stomped his\nhead, guards dragged him across the floor, Grant and\nIyiola pepper-sprayed him, and then left him alone for\n30 minutes screaming in pain. With Navejar lacking\ncounsel to reply to the defendants’ erroneous con-\ntention that the district court may safely disregard\nhis “self-serving” evidence, the district court accepted\nthat contention and thereby prejudiced Navejar.\n  Second, the defendants argued that Navejar’s excessive-\nforce claim was Heck-barred because the prison board\nfound Navejar guilty of disobeying orders and as-\nsaulting Iyiola. See Edwards v. Balisok, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118112\"><a href=\"/opinion/118112/edwards-v-balisok/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 648\n(1997); Heck v.

The\ndistrict court again agreed with the guards, ruling\nthat Heck bars the excessive-force claim. We disagree,\nobserving as we have before that pro se prisoners are\noften tripped up by Heck’s complexities. See Evans v.\nPoskon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1941\"><a href=\"/opinion/1941/evans-v-poskon/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (7th Cir. 2010); Gilbert v.

Navejar cannot deny\nthat he disobeyed orders or assaulted Iyiola because\nthose denials would “necessarily imply” the invalidity\nof his discipline. See Moore v. Mahone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"221046\"><a href=\"/opinion/221046/moore-v-mahone/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 724-\n25 (7th Cir. 2011); Evans, 603 F.3d at 364; Gilbert, 512\nF.3d at 900. But Navejar’s assault on Iyiola is not neces-\nsarily inconsistent with his sworn contention that the\nguards answered his assault with excessive force\nafter they subdued him. See Gilbert, 512 F.3d at 901-\n02 (reversing Heck-based judgment as a matter of\nlaw against inmate, remanding for trial on inmate’s\nexcessive-force claim despite prison board finding that\ninmate punched guard, and ordering district court to\n\fNo. 12-1182                                            11\n\nconsider recruiting counsel); Skrtich v.

Without a lawyer for\nNavejar to advocate the limits of Heck, the court\nmistakenly barred Navejar from arguing that, after he\nassaulted Iyiola, the guards responded with dispropor-\ntionate force. See Gilbert, 512 F.3d at 901-02.\n  Beyond these two errors, Navejar was also prej-\nudiced by proceeding without a lawyer after he was\ntransferred from Stateville. Like the plaintiff who was\ntransferred to a new prison in Santiago, once Navejar\nwas transferred, he faced “significant problems” in liti-\ngating pro se because, once at another institution, he\nwas not readily able to “identify key witnesses, depose\nthe defendants and gather pertinent evidence,” or\nproceed against John Doe defendants because he\ncouldn’t ascertain their identities. Santiago, 599 F.3d\nat 763, 766; see also Pruitt, 503 F.3d at 660. Navejar em-\nphasizes that he was restricted from corresponding\nwith individuals at Stateville, including those who\nmight have been witnesses to the brawl. See ILL. A DMIN.\nC ODE tit. 20, § 701.180(a). Aware of these limits, the\nnamed defendants avoided producing virtually every-\nthing he requested in discovery. Counsel would\nlikely not have faced the same obstacles. See Santiago,\n599 F.3d at 765.\n\f12                                            No. 12-1182\n\n  We conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat Navejar would have overcome summary judgment\nwith the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we R EVERSE\nthe grant of summary judgment on the excessive-force\nclaim and R EMAND for further proceedings consistent\nwith this order, including the recruitment of counsel\nfor Navejar. See Pruitt, 503 F.3d at 661. In all other re-\nspects the judgment is A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                          5-29-13\n\f</pre>",
