BACKGROUND\r<br>\r<br>                    The  instant  case  stems   from  a  dispute  over  the\r<br>\r<br>          circumstances under which a Quadrennial Assembly (the \"Assembly\")\r<br>\r<br>          of  the  AEELA  was  held  on  July  8,  1995.    The  AEELA  has\r<br>\r<br>          approximately 180,000 members, all of whom are  regular or former\r<br>\r<br>          employees  of the government of  Puerto Rico.   Of these members,\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          1    These \"matters\"  included the  following:  1) the  AEELA was\r<br>          created as a quasi-public entity to provide financial services to\r<br>          government employees, which is a traditional government function;\r                                                       __________\r<br>          2)  membership in the  AEELA is  mandatory for  most Commonwealth\r<br>          employees  as is  the 3%  payroll deduction  to fund  the AEELA's\r<br>          operations; 3) the AEELA's  operations and delegate elections are\r<br>          heavily  regulated  by  statute  (e.g.,  number  of  members  per\r<br>          delegate);  4)  heads  of  government   departments  appoint  the\r<br>          Election Committee to run the delegate elections; 5) the Board of\r<br>          Directors  and  the  Election  committee members  often  work  on\r<br>          government time, and use  government facilities and equipment; 6)\r<br>          the  AEELA's  finances  are  supervised  by  the   Commonwealth's\r<br>          Comptroller; 7) the AEELA  is exempt from state taxation;  8) the\r<br>          Commonwealth collects  the 3%  membership  fee for  the AEELA  by\r<br>          making payroll deductions; 9) the AEELA may make investments only\r<br>          \"on advice\" from the  Commonwealth's Treasury Department; 10) the\r<br>          AEELA's  employees participate  in the  Commonwealth government's\r<br>          pension  plan; 11) the Commonwealth provides  the AEELA with some\r<br>          services  free of charge; and 12) the AEELA's members, delegates,\r<br>          and directors are all government employees.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          75%  are required by law to participate  in and be members of the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA,  and are  required to  provide 3%  of their  salary  to be\r<br>\r<br>          administered by the AEELA.  Only employees of public corporations\r<br>\r<br>          and municipalities may participate in the AEELA.\r<br>\r<br>                    Plaintiffs contend,  and this court  must assume, given\r<br>\r<br>          our  procedural posture,  that Defendants have  exercised control\r<br>\r<br>          over  the AEELA  since 1987,  and used  this control  to handpick\r<br>\r<br>          delegates  to the Assembly in question in order to maintain their\r<br>\r<br>          control, and that  of the Popular Democratic  Party (\"PDP\"), over\r<br>\r<br>          the AEELA.   We must further infer  that Defendants impermissibly\r<br>\r<br>          notified only those delegates  who shared their political beliefs\r<br>\r<br>          that  the Assembly  would  be  held,  and  refused  to  take  the\r<br>\r<br>          necessary  measures  to  notify  or  confirm  the  membership  of\r<br>\r<br>          delegates who do not support the PDP.  Furthermore, we infer that\r<br>\r<br>          Defendants  denied  Plaintiff-Appellant  Nieves  a  list  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          certified delegates,  thus hindering her candidacy  for President\r<br>\r<br>          of the AEELA's Board of Directors.\r<br>\r<br>                    Plaintiffs charge that these actions amount  to illegal\r<br>\r<br>          political discrimination  in violation of their  rights under the\r<br>\r<br>          Due Process Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment  and the enabling\r<br>\r<br>          law  of  the Commonwealth  Employees  Association,  3 L.P.R.A.   \r<br>\r<br>          862(b).   They  also  contend, contrary  to  the  district  court\r<br>\r<br>          opinion dismissing their claim  under 28 U.S.C.   1983,  that the\r<br>\r<br>          acts of Defendants are state action.\r<br>\r<br>                                   III.

The Supreme Court in Lebr n focused on the degree\r          ___                                  ______\r<br>\r<br>          of  control  that the  federal government  had  over Amtrak.   In\r<br>\r<br>          contrast, neither party  in the instant  case has contended  that\r<br>\r<br>                                         -8-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          the Government  of Puerto  Rico has retained  permanent authority\r<br>\r<br>          over  the  directors of  the  AEELA.   This  distinction  becomes\r<br>\r<br>          clearer  when we  compare  the facts  surrounding Amtrak  and the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA.     The  President  appoints  the   majority  of  Amtrak's\r<br>\r<br>          directors,  the federal  government owns  all of  Amtrak's voting\r<br>\r<br>          stock, and the government subsidizes Amtrak's \"perennial losses.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Id. at 967.  By contrast, the government of Puerto  Rico does not\r          ___\r<br>\r<br>          retain the  power  to  appoint  any  of  the  AEELA's  directors.\r<br>\r<br>          Instead, the  directors are  elected by delegates  who themselves\r<br>\r<br>          are elected by the AEELA's membership at large.  Furthermore, the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA's  losses, if  any,  are not  regularly  subsidized by  the\r<br>\r<br>          government of  Puerto  Rico.   As  a result  of  these facts,  we\r<br>\r<br>          conclude that the AEELA  does not constitute an extension  of the\r<br>\r<br>          government of Puerto Rico,  and so Defendants must be  treated as\r<br>\r<br>          private parties.   Thus, direct  state action is  not present  in\r<br>\r<br>          this case.\r<br>\r<br>                              B.  Indirect State Action\r                              B.

We\r<br>\r<br>          believe that the state's grant of authority  alone cannot justify\r<br>\r<br>          a conclusion of state action in this case.\r<br>\r<br>                    We  draw  this  conclusion  by  comparing  two  of  our\r<br>\r<br>          previous cases.  First, like the district court, we are persuaded\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -11-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          by  our holding in Rockwell,  26 F.3d at  258, that state-granted\r                             ________\r<br>\r<br>          authority  making possible  a private  party's actions  does not,\r<br>\r<br>          without more,  sufficiently show  that the specific  action taken\r<br>\r<br>          under that authority constitutes state action.

In contrast, there is no evidence that the government of\r<br>\r<br>          Puerto Rico  somehow profited from  the allegedly  discriminatory\r<br>\r<br>          actions of  Defendants.  Even  though the AEELA  receives legally\r<br>\r<br>          mandated funds from public employees, no contention has been made\r<br>\r<br>          that  this money  becomes  the  property  of  the  AEELA  or  the\r<br>\r<br>          government.   In fact,  Plaintiffs have  not disputed  that, upon\r<br>\r<br>          termination of employment,  public employees  receive back  their\r<br>\r<br>          funds.   While  the Puerto  Rico Secretary  of the  Treasury does\r<br>\r<br>          approve  the investments  made  by the  AEELA  with these  funds,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs  have not contended that  these funds are somehow used\r<br>\r<br>          to  the benefit  of the  government of  Puerto Rico,  rather than\r<br>\r<br>          invested at a market  rate of return.  Also,  Plaintiffs have not\r<br>\r<br>          even  attempted  to link  the  alleged election  rigging  to some\r<br>\r<br>          financial gain to the government of Puerto Rico, in  the way that\r<br>\r<br>          the discrimination  in Burton was  linked to the  state's returns\r                                 ______\r<br>\r<br>          from the venture.  Thus, whatever financial success the AEELA may\r<br>\r<br>          achieve is not shared with the government of Puerto Rico.\r<br>\r<br>                    Similarly, while  the lack  of financial enrichment  is\r<br>\r<br>          not dispositive, and  \"[t]he test is  one of interdependence  and\r<br>\r<br>          joint  participation,\"  we agree  with  the  district court  that\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs have  failed to contest the proposition that the AEELA\r<br>\r<br>          is essentially independent in  the conduct of its  daily affairs.\r<br>\r<br>          And no  attempt has been  made to link  the government of  Puerto\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -15-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          Rico to the  decisions of when  to hold the  Assembly and how  to\r<br>\r<br>          conduct  Board elections.    As a  result,  we conclude  that  no\r<br>\r<br>          symbiotic relationship exists  between the  government of  Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico and the AEELA.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  passing,  we  observe  that in  the  instant  case,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs  have not  premised their  claim on a  private party's\r<br>\r<br>          specific act, directed  by the government  of Puerto Rico,  which\r<br>\r<br>          somehow benefits the government via a symbiotic relationship with\r<br>\r<br>          the private actor.

Essentially, the government  of Puerto\r                    ___\r<br>\r<br>          Rico was found to be advantaged  by the specific act on which the\r<br>\r<br>          complaint was grounded, namely, forced membership in the Colegio.\r<br>\r<br>                    By  contrast, plaintiffs  in  the instant  case do  not\r<br>\r<br>          mount a  facial challenge to  the laws that  create the  AEELA or\r<br>\r<br>          require that it  hold elections.   Instead, they  argue that  the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA's    leadership    committed    discretionary    acts    of\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination, and did so  while exercising authority granted by\r<br>\r<br>          the  government of  Puerto Rico.   But  plaintiffs fall  short of\r<br>\r<br>          Schneider in at least two ways.  First, the conduct they complain\r          _________\r<br>\r<br>          of --  discrimination -- is  not specifically mandated  by Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico law, as forced  membership in the Colegio was for lawyers in\r<br>\r<br>          Schneider.  Unlike the plaintiffs in Schneider, Plaintiffs do not\r          _________                            _________\r<br>\r<br>          challenge conduct  specifically directed by Puerto  Rico law; for\r<br>\r<br>          example, their forced membership in the  AEELA or the requirement\r<br>\r<br>          that  the   AEELA  hold  assemblies  and   elections.    Instead,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs complain of the  manner in which the assembly  and the\r                                      ______\r<br>\r<br>          elections  were held -- this  manner is not  directed by statute.\r                                        ______\r<br>\r<br>          Second, Plaintiffs  have failed  to link  these specific  acts of\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in  the holding of AEELA's  assembly and elections\r<br>\r<br>          to  any symbiotic  relationship by  which the  government profits\r<br>\r<br>          from these specific discriminatory acts.

BACKGROUND\r<br>\r<br>                    The  instant  case  stems   from  a  dispute  over  the\r<br>\r<br>          circumstances under which a Quadrennial Assembly (the \"Assembly\")\r<br>\r<br>          of  the  AEELA  was  held  on  July  8,  1995.    The  AEELA  has\r<br>\r<br>          approximately 180,000 members, all of whom are  regular or former\r<br>\r<br>          employees  of the government of  Puerto Rico.   Of these members,\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          1    These \"matters\"  included the  following:  1) the  AEELA was\r<br>          created as a quasi-public entity to provide financial services to\r<br>          government employees, which is a traditional government function;\r                                                       __________\r<br>          2)  membership in the  AEELA is  mandatory for  most Commonwealth\r<br>          employees  as is  the 3%  payroll deduction  to fund  the AEELA's\r<br>          operations; 3) the AEELA's  operations and delegate elections are\r<br>          heavily  regulated  by  statute  (e.g.,  number  of  members  per\r<br>          delegate);  4)  heads  of  government   departments  appoint  the\r<br>          Election Committee to run the delegate elections; 5) the Board of\r<br>          Directors  and  the  Election  committee members  often  work  on\r<br>          government time, and use  government facilities and equipment; 6)\r<br>          the  AEELA's  finances  are  supervised  by  the   Commonwealth's\r<br>          Comptroller; 7) the AEELA  is exempt from state taxation;  8) the\r<br>          Commonwealth collects  the 3%  membership  fee for  the AEELA  by\r<br>          making payroll deductions; 9) the AEELA may make investments only\r<br>          \"on advice\" from the  Commonwealth's Treasury Department; 10) the\r<br>          AEELA's  employees participate  in the  Commonwealth government's\r<br>          pension  plan; 11) the Commonwealth provides  the AEELA with some\r<br>          services  free of charge; and 12) the AEELA's members, delegates,\r<br>          and directors are all government employees.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          75%  are required by law to participate  in and be members of the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA,  and are  required to  provide 3%  of their  salary  to be\r<br>\r<br>          administered by the AEELA.  Only employees of public corporations\r<br>\r<br>          and municipalities may participate in the AEELA.\r<br>\r<br>                    Plaintiffs contend,  and this court  must assume, given\r<br>\r<br>          our  procedural posture,  that Defendants have  exercised control\r<br>\r<br>          over  the AEELA  since 1987,  and used  this control  to handpick\r<br>\r<br>          delegates  to the Assembly in question in order to maintain their\r<br>\r<br>          control, and that  of the Popular Democratic  Party (\"PDP\"), over\r<br>\r<br>          the AEELA.   We must further infer  that Defendants impermissibly\r<br>\r<br>          notified only those delegates  who shared their political beliefs\r<br>\r<br>          that  the Assembly  would  be  held,  and  refused  to  take  the\r<br>\r<br>          necessary  measures  to  notify  or  confirm  the  membership  of\r<br>\r<br>          delegates who do not support the PDP.  Furthermore, we infer that\r<br>\r<br>          Defendants  denied  Plaintiff-Appellant  Nieves  a  list  of  the\r<br>\r<br>          certified delegates,  thus hindering her candidacy  for President\r<br>\r<br>          of the AEELA's Board of Directors.\r<br>\r<br>                    Plaintiffs charge that these actions amount  to illegal\r<br>\r<br>          political discrimination  in violation of their  rights under the\r<br>\r<br>          Due Process Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment  and the enabling\r<br>\r<br>          law  of  the Commonwealth  Employees  Association,  3 L.P.R.A.   \r<br>\r<br>          862(b).   They  also  contend, contrary  to  the  district  court\r<br>\r<br>          opinion dismissing their claim  under 28 U.S.C.   1983,  that the\r<br>\r<br>          acts of Defendants are state action.\r<br>\r<br>                                   III.

The Supreme Court in Lebr n focused on the degree\r          ___                                  ______\r<br>\r<br>          of  control  that the  federal government  had  over Amtrak.   In\r<br>\r<br>          contrast, neither party  in the instant  case has contended  that\r<br>\r<br>                                         -8-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          the Government  of Puerto  Rico has retained  permanent authority\r<br>\r<br>          over  the  directors of  the  AEELA.   This  distinction  becomes\r<br>\r<br>          clearer  when we  compare  the facts  surrounding Amtrak  and the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA.     The  President  appoints  the   majority  of  Amtrak's\r<br>\r<br>          directors,  the federal  government owns  all of  Amtrak's voting\r<br>\r<br>          stock, and the government subsidizes Amtrak's \"perennial losses.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Id. at 967.  By contrast, the government of Puerto  Rico does not\r          ___\r<br>\r<br>          retain the  power  to  appoint  any  of  the  AEELA's  directors.\r<br>\r<br>          Instead, the  directors are  elected by delegates  who themselves\r<br>\r<br>          are elected by the AEELA's membership at large.  Furthermore, the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA's  losses, if  any,  are not  regularly  subsidized by  the\r<br>\r<br>          government of  Puerto  Rico.   As  a result  of  these facts,  we\r<br>\r<br>          conclude that the AEELA  does not constitute an extension  of the\r<br>\r<br>          government of Puerto Rico,  and so Defendants must be  treated as\r<br>\r<br>          private parties.   Thus, direct  state action is  not present  in\r<br>\r<br>          this case.\r<br>\r<br>                              B.  Indirect State Action\r                              B.

As  a result, we find extraneous  Plaintiffs' arguments\r<br>\r<br>          highlighting  the facts that the  AEELA was created  by law, that\r<br>\r<br>          its members  and Directors  are  public employees,  and that  the\r<br>\r<br>          elective process is regulated  by law, except to the  degree that\r<br>\r<br>          these facts  demonstrate government coercion  or encouragement of\r<br>\r<br>          the complained-of conduct.\r<br>\r<br>                    Plaintiffs  contend  that   Defendants  derived   their\r<br>\r<br>          authority  to schedule  the Assembly  and election from  a Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico  law,  3  L.P.R.A.     862(d),   and  that  Defendants  were\r<br>\r<br>          government employees who  performed their  duties during  working\r<br>\r<br>          time  and using  government  equipment and  materials.   However,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs have  hung their claim on the  proposition that state-\r<br>\r<br>          granted authority suffices to find  state action, since they have\r<br>\r<br>          failed to  allege that the  government coerced or  encouraged the\r<br>\r<br>          specific election rigging that gives rise to their complaint.  We\r<br>\r<br>          believe that the state's grant of authority  alone cannot justify\r<br>\r<br>          a conclusion of state action in this case.\r<br>\r<br>                    We  draw  this  conclusion  by  comparing  two  of  our\r<br>\r<br>          previous cases.

In contrast, there is no evidence that the government of\r<br>\r<br>          Puerto Rico  somehow profited from  the allegedly  discriminatory\r<br>\r<br>          actions of  Defendants.  Even  though the AEELA  receives legally\r<br>\r<br>          mandated funds from public employees, no contention has been made\r<br>\r<br>          that  this money  becomes  the  property  of  the  AEELA  or  the\r<br>\r<br>          government.   In fact,  Plaintiffs have  not disputed  that, upon\r<br>\r<br>          termination of employment,  public employees  receive back  their\r<br>\r<br>          funds.   While  the Puerto  Rico Secretary  of the  Treasury does\r<br>\r<br>          approve  the investments  made  by the  AEELA  with these  funds,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs  have not contended that  these funds are somehow used\r<br>\r<br>          to  the benefit  of the  government of  Puerto Rico,  rather than\r<br>\r<br>          invested at a market  rate of return.  Also,  Plaintiffs have not\r<br>\r<br>          even  attempted  to link  the  alleged election  rigging  to some\r<br>\r<br>          financial gain to the government of Puerto Rico, in  the way that\r<br>\r<br>          the discrimination  in Burton was  linked to the  state's returns\r                                 ______\r<br>\r<br>          from the venture.  Thus, whatever financial success the AEELA may\r<br>\r<br>          achieve is not shared with the government of Puerto Rico.\r<br>\r<br>                    Similarly, while  the lack  of financial enrichment  is\r<br>\r<br>          not dispositive, and  \"[t]he test is  one of interdependence  and\r<br>\r<br>          joint  participation,\"  we agree  with  the  district court  that\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs have  failed to contest the proposition that the AEELA\r<br>\r<br>          is essentially independent in  the conduct of its  daily affairs.\r<br>\r<br>          And no  attempt has been  made to link  the government of  Puerto\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -15-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          Rico to the  decisions of when  to hold the  Assembly and how  to\r<br>\r<br>          conduct  Board elections.    As a  result,  we conclude  that  no\r<br>\r<br>          symbiotic relationship exists  between the  government of  Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico and the AEELA.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  passing,  we  observe  that in  the  instant  case,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs  have not  premised their  claim on a  private party's\r<br>\r<br>          specific act, directed  by the government  of Puerto Rico,  which\r<br>\r<br>          somehow benefits the government via a symbiotic relationship with\r<br>\r<br>          the private actor.

Instead, they  argue that  the\r<br>\r<br>          AEELA's    leadership    committed    discretionary    acts    of\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination, and did so  while exercising authority granted by\r<br>\r<br>          the  government of  Puerto Rico.   But  plaintiffs fall  short of\r<br>\r<br>          Schneider in at least two ways.  First, the conduct they complain\r          _________\r<br>\r<br>          of --  discrimination -- is  not specifically mandated  by Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico law, as forced  membership in the Colegio was for lawyers in\r<br>\r<br>          Schneider.  Unlike the plaintiffs in Schneider, Plaintiffs do not\r          _________                            _________\r<br>\r<br>          challenge conduct  specifically directed by Puerto  Rico law; for\r<br>\r<br>          example, their forced membership in the  AEELA or the requirement\r<br>\r<br>          that  the   AEELA  hold  assemblies  and   elections.    Instead,\r<br>\r<br>          Plaintiffs complain of the  manner in which the assembly  and the\r                                      ______\r<br>\r<br>          elections  were held -- this  manner is not  directed by statute.\r                                        ______\r<br>\r<br>          Second, Plaintiffs  have failed  to link  these specific  acts of\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination in  the holding of AEELA's  assembly and elections\r<br>\r<br>          to  any symbiotic  relationship by  which the  government profits\r<br>\r<br>          from these specific discriminatory acts.  No  allegation has been\r<br>\r<br>          made  that the government of Puerto Rico is somehow advantaged by\r<br>\r<br>          the  alleged  misconduct in  AEELA's assembly  or elections.   By\r<br>\r<br>          contrast, in  Schneider, bar  membership required by  Puerto Rico\r                        _________\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -17-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          law constituted  the conduct complained of, and  also was alleged\r<br>\r<br>          to  benefit  the  government  of Puerto  Rico,  since  compulsory\r<br>\r<br>          membership made possible the  Colegio's regulatory functions.  As\r<br>\r<br>          a  result of these distinctions,  we conclude that Schneider does\r                                                             _________\r<br>\r<br>          not avail Plaintiffs.\r<br>\r<br>                                      CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r<br>\r<br>                    To maintain a Section 1983 action, state action must be\r<br>\r<br>          present.   Because we conclude that, reading the pleadings in the\r<br>\r<br>          best light for  Plaintiffs, they can  prove no set of  facts that\r<br>\r<br>          would implicate state action, the judgment of the district  court\r<br>\r<br>          is\r<br>\r<br>          affirmed.\r          affirmed.\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -18-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",
