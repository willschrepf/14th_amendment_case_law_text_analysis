For the\n\nreasons discussed below, the motions will be granted in part and denied in part.\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n               Plaintiff Jillian Brown, an African-American female, began her employment at\n\nChildren’s Hospital National Medical Center (“CNMC”), Emergency Medical Services for\n\nChildren (“EMSC”), National Resource Center (“NRC”), as a temporary employee in October\n\n2002; she became a permanent employee, an Office Coordinator, in April 2003. Compl. at 8-9.\n\nAmong NRC’s employees were plaintiff’s direct supervisor, Edward Liao, id. at 9, Theresa\n\nMorrison-Quintana, Partnership Outreach Team Leader, see id. at 2, Susan Eads Role, Director\n\nof Partnerships and Public Policy, id. at 3, Jocelyn Hulbert, State Partnership Outreach\n\nCoordinator, id. at 2, 10, and Kenneth Allen, id. at 5, Director of Program Planning and Training,\n\fid. at 22, to whom Morrison-Quintana and Hulbert reported, id. at 12.1 After Liao resigned in\n\nJuly 2006, plaintiff assumed certain of his duties, including supervision of two Administrative\n\nAssistants, Patricia Thompson and Nanette Pierre, both African American. Id. at 7-8. Plaintiff\n\nthen reported directly to the NRC’s Executive Director, Dr. Jane Ball. Id. at 9, 21.\n\n               In the fall of 2006, Dr. Ball announced her retirement effective at the end of that\n\nyear. Compl. at 10. According to plaintiff, Role and Allen “began pressuring [plaintiff] to join,\n\nand later lead, a committee to align itself against Dr. Ball.” Id. Specifically, Role and Allen\n\nintended to coerce Dr. Ball either to appoint one of them as the new Executive Director, or to\n\nappoint both as Co-Directors, by threatening to accuse Dr. Ball of misappropriating federal\n\nfunds. Id. In furtherance of the plot, Role and Allen allegedly sought to obtain plaintiff’s\n\nsignature on a statement attesting to false allegations against Dr. Ball. Id. Plaintiff refused, and\n\ninstead reported these events to Kathryn Koepenick, the NRC’s Senior Human Resources\n\nConsultant, in October 2006. Id. Apparently there was an investigation into Dr. Ball’s activities,\n\nand in November 2006 she was “found . . . innocent.” Id. During the last week of December\n\n2006, Dr. Ball allegedly warned plaintiff that she and Hulbert should “keep a low profile”\n\nbecause Allen had them “on his radar.” Id. Dr. Ball allegedly shared her concerns with Tasmeen\n\nSingh, who became NRC’s Executive Director as of January 1, 2007. Id.\n\n               On January 3, 2007, Singh requested a meeting with plaintiff to discuss\n\n“accusations made against [her] by ‘many/several staff.’” Compl. at 12. Plaintiff was accused of\n\nhaving said that Hulbert earned more than Morrison-Quintana, having forced Morrison-Quintana\n\n\n\n       1\n               Plaintiff has named Theresa Morrison-Quintana and Jocelyn Hulbert as\ndefendants, as well as CNMC, Kathryn Kozpenick, and Tasmeen Singh.\n\n                                                  2\n\fto adjust her telecommuting schedule, and having behaved rudely to others because she was\n\ndissatisfied with her job. Id. According to plaintiff, the events giving rise to these complaints\n\noccurred several years earlier, see id. at 8; yet none had been raised with prior management\n\nbecause plaintiff “was supposedly viewed as ‘intimidating and physically intimidating’ and a\n\n‘favorite’ of [Dr.] Ball.” Id. During this meeting, Singh “made comments that made it obvious\n\nthat she was aware [plaintiff] had filed a charge of discrimination against a former employer\n\nalleging racial discrimination.” Id. at 37. When plaintiff asked who had made complaints\n\nagainst her, Singh responded that the complainant was Thompson, one of the administrative\n\nassistants whom plaintiff supervised; other staff members allegedly confirmed Thompson’s\n\nassertions. Id. at 12. Plaintiff later learned that Morrison-Quintana was her principal accuser.\n\nSee id. at 3, 14, 19.\n\n                Believing that “Dr. Ball’s fears were coming to fruition far sooner than [she]\n\nexpected,” on January 4, 2007, plaintiff called Hulbert to ask whether anyone had asked her\n\nquestions about plaintiff. Compl. at 13. Hulbert responded that, prior to January 3, 2007, Singh\n\n“solicited feedback from her [about plaintiff],” and Hulbert had repeated “what she had heard”\n\nfrom others. Id. Plaintiff allegedly warned Hulbert “to be careful because Dr. Ball . . . had the\n\nsame fears regarding . . . Hulbert.” Id.\n\n                On January 5, 2007, Singh and Koepenick informed plaintiff that she would be\n\nsuspended “for ‘bullying and intimidating’” Hulbert. Compl. at 13. Singh stated that “several\n\nemployees made allegations against [plaintiff],” and because “too many [were] saying the exact\n\nsame thing . . . an investigation would be conducted.” Id. Plaintiff believed that “she was being\n\nsubjected to a hostile work environment because one, or ‘many/several’ employees were making\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ffalse allegations against her, the fabricated allegations were only supported by gossip and\n\nhearsay,” and that no one had any “intention of interviewing, question[ing] or speaking with [her]\n\nto hear her side of the story.” Id. Rather, plaintiff “was already considered to be guilty of the\n\nallegations,” id., and indeed was found “guilty of the allegations, additional transgressions,\n\nand . . . was rude, had communication issues, was a bully, intimidating, physically intimidating,\n\nconfrontational, participates in unprofessional gossip discussions, and was retaliatory.” Id. at 14.\n\n                On January 11, 2007, plaintiff reported to the NRC “to learn of . . . the\n\ninvestigative findings.” Compl. at 14. On that date, Singh issued a Final Written Notice to\n\nplaintiff, id., which in relevant part stated:\n\n                [T]he notice is being issued because of concerns having to do with\n                1. intimidating conduct at the work place and 2. inappropriate\n                communications of confidential information and 3. inappropriate\n                conversations regarding other employees. As your manager, I have\n                learned about this behavior through my investigation and through\n                unsolicited complaints.\n\n                In response to these concerns and complaints, I spoke to you on\n                January 3, 2007 to allow you the opportunity to respond and present\n                your perspective. At the conclusion of this conversation I directed\n                you not to have any conversations regarding our meeting with any\n                staff member. However, the next morning it was brought to my\n                attention that you called a staff member directly to ask if that\n                individual had spoken to me regarding your performance and made\n                comments to that individual about her own job security. As a result\n                of this retaliatory and intimidating behavior, the decision was made\n                to immediately remove you from the workplace by initiating a\n                suspension pending the completion of the investigation. As part of\n                that process, we gave you an opportunity to respond to the complaints\n                made against you.\n\n                At this time, I have formally recommended that we lift the suspension\n                so you can return to work. This notice is to provide you with clear\n                expectations of the sorts of behaviors that are and are not permitted\n                [, and plaintiff was instructed to] refrain from:\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f1.     Conversations with employees about any NRC employee’s\n       salary (including your own) or budget information or any\n       other sensitive employment or contract information.\n\n2.     Unprofessional “gossip” such as discussions about who might\n       get fired or warning employees that they are “next to go” or\n       acting in other ways that lend themselves to a hostile work\n       environment for those around you.\n\n3.     Making inappropriate remarks to co-workers regarding the\n       reasonableness of compensation for NRC staff, the\n       qualifications of employees for their pay grade and job duties,\n       or the productivity of co-workers.\n\n4.     Being confrontational and/or intimidating in your demeanor\n       including the use of an unusually loud tone or the use of\n       physical gestures that may reasonably be construed as\n       intimidating to any employee.\n\n5.     Retaliatory conduct against other employees who may have\n       brought concerns about your conduct to the manager. This\n       includes harassing dialogue with employees such as asking\n       them directly whether they complained, engaging in\n       conversations with any employee about what was said or the\n       terms of the suspension or this final notice, or any other\n       conversations related to the complaints brought against you.\n\n                              * * *\n\nIt is expected that you demonstrate cooperative, courteous and\nprofessional behavior at all times. Any incidents of not responding\nto requests in a reasonable timeframe, or any other inappropriate\nactions/inaction or problematic communication is also not acceptable\nbehavior under the terms of this notice.\n\nWhile it is my sincere intention to work with you in good faith to\novercome these performance issues, I need to be absolutely clear that\nfailure to follow the instructions above, engagement in any form of\nretaliation or any continued performance problem will result in your\nimmediate termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fPl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. #9] (“Pl.’s First Opp’n”), Ex. F (Final\n\nWritten Notice) at 1-2 (emphasis added).2\n\n               On January 16, 2007, plaintiff “filed a complaint with the EEOC and copied . . .\n\nSingh, . . . Koepenick and the Human Resources Department on the complaint.” Compl. at 25;\n\nsee id. at 16, 33. The complaint took the form of correspondence to the Washington Field Office\n\nof the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”). Pl.’s First Opp’n, Ex. J (Letters\n\nfrom plaintiff to EEOC dated January 15, 2007). After describing at length her suspension and\n\nthe Final Written Notice, plaintiff requested that the EEOC “review [her] submission and . . .\n\ninvestigate this tangible employment action, discrimination/disparate treatment, retaliation,\n\nharassment, and hostile work environment.” Id., Ex. J at J2 (page number designated by\n\nplaintiff). Plaintiff submitted an additional letter to the EEOC. See id., Ex. K (Letter from\n\nplaintiff to Hal Budnick, Intake Officer, Washington Field Office, EEOC, dated May 11, 2007).\n\nThe outcome of this exchange is not clear.\n\n               After these events, plaintiff allegedly no longer received group e-mail messages,\n\nwas not notified of mandatory training, was denied access to CNMC’s personnel policies and\n\nwas prevented “from utilizing CNMC’s Employee Complaint process to file internal grievances.”\n\nCompl. at 24. Her workload was increased to include the taking of meeting minutes (previously\n\na task assigned to an employee at a lower grade), making photocopies, and covering the front\n\n\n       2\n                 Singh allegedly “made comments that made it obvious that she was aware that\n[plaintiff] filed a charge of discrimination against a former employer alleging racial\ndiscrimination.” Compl. at 37. These comments may have been made either at the meeting\nduring which the Final Written Notice was issued or at the time plaintiff was notified of her\ntermination. According to plaintiff, both the disciplinary actions taken against her and her\ntermination by RIF were “directly related to her prior protected activity.” Id.\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fdesk when the receptionist was not available, while in other respects she was “stripped . . . of her\n\nduties.” Id. at 25. For example, plaintiff no longer was responsible for processing and\n\nreconciling check and travel requests, id. at 6, was denied access to files containing budget\n\ninformation, id. at 8, was denied a master key which would have given plaintiff access to other\n\nemployees’ offices, id., and otherwise was “held up to all as an employee who could not be\n\ntrusted with keys, files, [and] confidential information[.]” Id. at 22. Singh allegedly “monitored\n\nand questioned [her] every move, evaluated and reevaluated every task [she] performed,\n\nmicromanaged . . ., marginalized [her] within the department, effectively demoted [her] and\n\n[became] an oppressive presence in [her] work environment.” Id. at 25.\n\n               Plaintiff took particular exception to the conditions set forth in the Final Written\n\nNotice directing her to refrain from using a tone of voice or physical gestures that reasonably\n\ncould be construed as intimidating to any employee. In her view, this provision allowed her\n\ncoworkers “to construe [her] movements in any way that they saw fit,” and the terms “were\n\nmeant to humiliate [her] and to place her in a subservient position to her Caucasian coworkers.”\n\nCompl. at 17. She believed that she “was prohibited from using body language,” and [e]ven\n\nthough communication is more nonverbal than verbal, [she] faced immediate termination if it\n\nwere construed that she used any body language.” Id. at 26. She was “in constant fear of losing\n\nher job because the language of the Final Written Notice was so subjective that . . . any employee\n\ncould . . . accuse [her] of ‘being confrontational and/or intimidating in [her] demeanor[.]’” Id. In\n\naddition, according to plaintiff, Singh, Koepenick and some of plaintiff’s co-workers allegedly\n\n“used stereotypes,” describing her “as the loud black woman who rolls her eyes, was angry,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fphysically intimidated everyone, used body language, was a bully and had a problem\n\ncommunicating.” Id. at 16.\n\n               Plaintiff’s employment came to an end on March 5, 2007, at which time Singh\n\nand Koepenick informed her that, “[a]s a result of an internal evaluation of the administrative\n\npersonnel needs at the [NRC], the position of Office Coordinator [was] being eliminated.”\n\nCompl. at 17. Pursuant to a reduction in force (“RIF”), four employees were terminated, three\n\nAfrican American (plaintiff, Thompson and Pierre) and one Caucasian. Id. at 3, 18. Three new\n\nadministrative positions were created, and the position of Staff Assistant “would assume all of\n\nthe prior responsibilities” of plaintiff and the two terminated African-American Administrative\n\nAssistants. Id. According to plaintiff, NRC merely terminated her, changed the position title,\n\nand transferred her responsibilities to a newly titled position, such that she “was terminated via a\n\npretextual RIF.” Id. Plaintiff deemed her termination by RIF the culmination of a series of\n\n“numerous negative tangible employment actions,” Compl. at 19, designed to accomplish what\n\notherwise could not have occurred under the prevailing law. Pl.’s First Opp’n at 4-5.\n\n               On July 12, 2007, plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Mem.\n\nin Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. #7-1] (“Defs.’ First Mem.”), Ex. A (Charge of Discrimination,\n\nNo. 570-2007-00866 dated July 12, 2007). According to the charge, plaintiff alleged that CNMC\n\ndiscriminated against her on the basis of her race and in retaliation for prior EEO activity\n\nbetween January 3, 2007 and March 13, 2007. Id., Ex. A. CNMC allegedly was responsible for\n\n“Race-Based and Retaliatory Discrimination; Retaliation; Harassment; Intentional Infliction Of\n\nEmotional Distress; Hostile Work Environment; Adverse/Tangible Employment Actions\n\n(Heightened Scrutiny, Disparate Treatment, Decreased Responsibilities, Reprimand, Negative\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fEvaluation, Demotion, Discharge); Pretextual Argument For My Termination; Constructive\n\nTermination; Actual termination (by way of the pretextual RIF[]).” Id., Attach. at 2.3 The EEOC\n\nwas “unable to conclude that the information obtained [during its investigation] establishes\n\nviolations” of the applicable employment discrimination statutes. Compl., Ex. A (Dismissal and\n\nNotice of Rights dated September 23, 2009).\n\n               Plaintiff brings this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title\n\nVII”), as amended, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (“Section 1981”), and\n\nunder the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”), see D.C. Code § 1-1402.01 et\n\nseq. In addition, she brings common law claims of defamation, negligence, intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress (“IIED”), and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Plaintiff\n\ndemands that any reference to her suspension and final written notice be expunged from her\n\npersonnel file, that each defendant send plaintiff a letter of apology, and that a letter of reprimand\n\nbe placed in each individual defendant’s personnel file. She also demands unspecified\n\ncompensation for past and future economic and non-economic losses.\n\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\n            A. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n               The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a complaint contain “‘a short\n\nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’ in order to ‘give\n\nthe defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’” Bell Atl.\n\nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957));\n\n\n       3\n             Plaintiff attached to her EEOC complaint a four-page typewritten document called\n“Complaint-Particulars.”\n\n                                                  9\n\faccord Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007) (per curiam). Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal\n\nsufficiency of a complaint. See Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). “To\n\nsurvive a [Rule 12(b)(6)] motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,\n\naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.\n\nCt. 1937, 1949 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. A complaint must be\n\ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) if it consists only of “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a\n\ncause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.\n\n                On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court treats the factual allegations of a plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint as if they were true, and draws all reasonable inferences stemming from such factual\n\nallegations in the plaintiff’s favor. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94; Maljack Prods., Inc.\n\nv. Motion Picture Ass’n of Am., Inc., 52 F.3d 373, 375 (D.C. Cir. 1995). While the complaint is\n\nto be “construed liberally in the [plaintiff’s] favor,” the Court “need not accept inferences drawn\n\nby plaintiff[] if such inferences are unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint.” Kowal v.\n\nMCI Commc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994); see also Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n\n550 U.S. at 555 (stating that a court is “not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as\n\na factual allegation”). Although “[a] pro se complaint . . . ‘must be held to less stringent\n\nstandards than formal pleadings by lawyers,’” Atherton v. D.C. Office of the Mayor, 567 F.3d\n\n672, 681 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. at 94), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct.\n\n2064 (2010), “a pro se complainant must plead ‘factual matter’ that permits the court to infer\n\n‘more than the mere possibility of misconduct.’” Id. at 681-82 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.\n\nCt. at 1950).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f                                 B.

Title VII\n\n               Under Title VII, it is “an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail\n\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\n\nindividual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n\nbecause of [her] race[.]” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Nor may an employer discriminate against\n\nan employee who has opposed an unlawful employment practice by making a charge, testifying,\n\nassisting or participating in an investigation or proceeding arising from a violation of Title VII.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). This language identifies “two elements for an employment\n\ndiscrimination case: (I) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action (ii) because of [her]\n\nrace” or prior protected activity. Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 493\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n               Defendants represent that the complaint “goes on for pages concerning the alleged\n\nharassing and retaliatory conduct [plaintiff] claims she experienced,” Defs. Children’s Nat’l\n\nMed. Ctr. and Kathryn Kopenick’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Second Mem.”)\n\n[Dkt. # 12-1] at 7, focusing on “her purported unfair treatment after . . . Singh became director of\n\nher department in January 2007.” Id. at 7-8. Yet, defendants continue, plaintiff’s “allegations of\n\nracial discrimination and retaliation are belied by her own factual assertions,” id. at 8, principally\n\nthose which “tie the alleged disciplinary action and purported hostile conduct . . . to her prior\n\nrelationship with the former department head,” id., her refusal to participate in a scheme to\n\nappoint the new Director of the NRC, id., and retribution for supporting Dr. Ball. Id. at 9.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f                 Defendants’ reading of the complaint is overly narrow and appears to ignore\n\nplaintiff’s awkward but perceptible efforts to tie defendants’ adverse employment actions to her\n\nrace. For example, plaintiff alleges that she, “an African-American employee of . . . CNMC, was\n\ntreated in a manner different from her similarly situated coworkers, and was subjected to . . .\n\nCNMC’s altering the terms and conditions of her employment.” Compl. at 15. She also alleges\n\nthat the RIF was a pretext for discrimination against her and other African American employees.\n\nId.; see id. at 17-19, 30. And with her assertion that “the disciplinary actions taken against her\n\nand the termination of her employment from CNMC . . . [were] directly related to her prior\n\nprotected activity,” Compl. at 37; see id. at 25, 33, plaintiff manages to allege a claim of\n\nretaliation in violation of Title VII. It matters not that plaintiff failed to “specifically mention\n\nrace-based discrimination until many pages into her Complaint.” Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.\n\nChildren’s Nat’l Med. Ctr.’s and Kathryn Koepenick’s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. #14] (“Pl.’s Second\n\nOpp’n”) at 21.\n\n                 As the Court construes the complaint, plaintiff alleges that defendants both\n\ndiscriminated against her on the basis of her race and retaliated against her by suspending her, by\n\nissuing a Final Written Notice, and by terminating her through a pretextual RIF. The complaint\n\nis not a model of clarity; it is rambling, disorganized and repetitive. But it is also prepared by a\n\npro se plaintiff and its allegations must be construed liberally. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S.\n\n519, 520 (1972); Atherton v. D.C. Office of the Mayor, 567 F.3d at 681. Notwithstanding the\n\nimprecise and inartful drafting, plaintiff’s complaint goes beyond mere conclusory statements\n\nand sets forth specific factual allegations that tend to support her causes of action. In other\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fwords, the complaint does not “stop[] short of the line between possibility and plausibility of\n\nentitlement to relief.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.\n\n               Moreover, plaintiff’s obligation at the pleading stage is to put defendants on\n\nnotice of the claims against them and the bases on which they rest. Plaintiff accomplishes this\n\ntask; she need not plead all the facts she ultimately must prove in order to prevail on the merits.\n\nSee Atchison v. District of Columbia, 73 F.3d 418, 421-22 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also\n\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (“This simplified notice pleading\n\nstandard relies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts\n\nand issues and to dispose of unmeritorious claims.”). Treating plaintiff’s factual allegations as if\n\nthey were true, and drawing all reasonable inferences stemming from such factual allegations in\n\nher favor, the Court concludes that plaintiff adequately states a claim of discrimination based on\n\nrace and a claim for retaliation under Title VII. See, e.g., Winston v. Clough, No. 07-1411, 2010\n\nWL 1875626, at *8 (D.D.C. May 11, 2010); Kornegay v. AT&T, No. 05-0001, 2006 WL 825622,\n\nat *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 29, 2006) (“In other words, plaintiff claims that he was a qualified employee\n\nterminated under false pretenses because of his race [or protected activity] and therefore he need\n\nnot plead all the elements of a Title VII race discrimination [or retaliation] claim in order to state\n\na claim.”) (brackets omitted).\n\n       The next question is who may properly be sued under Title VII. An employer is defined\n\nunder Title VII as “a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more\n\nemployees . . . and any agent of such a person.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). Ostensibly, then, a\n\ncomplainant’s supervisors or co-workers may be considered the agents of an employer. But the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit has rejected the notion that such individuals may be held personally\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fliable under Title VII. “[W]hile a supervisory employee may be joined as a party defendant in a\n\nTitle VII action, that employee must be viewed as being sued in his capacity as the agent of the\n\nemployer, who is alone liable for a violation of Title VII.” Gary v. Long, 59 F.3d 1391, 1393\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir. 1991)), cert.\n\ndenied, 516 U.S. 1011 (1995). To the extent that plaintiff joins Singh, Morrison-Quintana,\n\nHulbert and Koepenick as defendants to her Title VII claims because of their status as agents of\n\nthe employer, these claims “essentially merge[] with her claim against [CNMC].” Id. Plaintiff’s\n\nTitle VII claims against Singh, Morrison-Quintana, Hulbert and Koepenick in their individual\n\ncapacities therefore must be dismissed. See, e.g., Laurent v. Bureau of Rehab., Inc., 544 F. Supp.\n\n2d 17, 25 (D.D.C. 2008) (granting summary judgment for the individual defendants who may be\n\nsued in their official capacities, not their individual capacities, under Title VII); Isse v. Am. Univ.,\n\n540 F. Supp. 2d 9, 27 (D.D.C. 2008) (dismissing Title VII claim against plaintiff’s immediate\n\nsupervisor); McMillan v. District of Columbia, 466 F. Supp. 2d 219, 223 (D.D.C. 2006)\n\n(dismissing Title VII claim against acting department chief in his individual capacity).\n\n\n                                           2. Section 1981\n\n                Section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code provides: “All persons within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to\n\nmake and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). The\n\nstatute further “prohibits racial discrimination in the ‘making, performance, modification, and\n\ntermination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms and conditions of the\n\ncontractual relationship.’” Pollard v. Quest Diagnostics, 610 F. Supp. 2d 1, 17-18 (D.D.C. 2009)\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1981(b)). It is established that such contracts include employment\n\ncontracts. See Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 460 (1975). To state a claim\n\nunder Section 1981, a plaintiff “must identify an impaired ‘contractual relationship’ . . . under\n\nwhich [she] has rights,” Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 476 (2006), and she\n\nmust allege “some facts that demonstrate that race was the reason for the defendant’s actions.”\n\nBray v. RHT, Inc., 748 F. Supp. 3, 5 (D.D.C. 1990).\n\n               Defendants argue that, because the complaint fails to allege discrimination based\n\non race, it therefore fails to allege a Section 1981 claim. “Rather, [p]laintiff specifically alleges\n\nthat the conduct about which she complains stemmed from a power struggle within her\n\ndepartment and her support of the outgoing Executive Director.” Defs.’ Second Mem. at 9; see\n\nDefs.’ First Mem. at 7. For the same reasons that the Court has concluded that the factual\n\nallegations of plaintiff’s complaint support her Title VII claim, these same allegations necessarily\n\nsupport her Section 1981 claim of discrimination based on race.\n\n               Because the complaint includes no express allegations as to the existence of a\n\nformal, written contract or employment agreement between plaintiff and CNMC, the Court\n\npresumes that plaintiff was an at-will employee of CNMC. Carl v. Children’s Hosp., 702 A.2d\n\n159, 162 (D.C. 1997) (Terry, J., concurring) (“This court has long and consistently adhered to the\n\nrule that employment is presumed to be at will, unless the contract of employment expressly\n\nprovides otherwise.”). It is established that an at-will employee may maintain an action under\n\nSection 1981. See Sheppard v. Dickstein, Shapiro, Morin & Oshinsky, 59 F. Supp. 2d 27, 32\n\n(D.D.C. 1999) (holding that Section 1981 covers at-will employment agreements because\n\n“District of Columbia law . . . treat[s] at-will agreements as contracts”).\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f               An employment discrimination claim brought under Section 1981 “mirrors, in\n\nmost ways, an employment discrimination claim brought pursuant to Title VII . . . . [But]\n\n[u]nlike Title VII, individual liability can be imposed for personal involvement in discriminatory\n\nactivity that violates Section 1981.” Zaidi v. Amerada Hess Corp., 723 F. Supp. 2d 506, 516-17\n\n(E.D.N.Y. 2010) (citations omitted). Moreover, “[i]ndividuals with supervisory authority . . .\n\nmay be held liable under [Section] 1981.” Tnaib v. Document Technologies, LLC, 450 F. Supp.\n\n2d 87, 92 (D.D.C. 2006) (citing cases); see also Sheppard v. Dickstein, Shapiro, Morin &\n\nOshinsky, 59 F. Supp. 2d at 33 (finding that individual supervisors can be sued under Section\n\n1981 and denying their motion to dismiss); see Page v. Winn-Dixie Montgomery, Inc., 702 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1334 (S.D. Ala. 2010) (noting that “a claim for individual liability under [Section] 1981\n\nrequires an affirmative showing linking the individual defendant with the discriminatory\n\naction.”). Therefore, under District of Columbia law, an at-will employee alleging discrimination\n\nbased on race may bring a Section 1981 claim not only against her employer but also against\n\nthose supervisors who take actions in violation of Section 1981. At this stage of the proceedings\n\nand on the current record, the complaint sufficiently alleges a Section 1981 claim against all\n\ndefendants. Their motions to dismiss the Section 1981 claim will be denied without prejudice.\n\n\n                           3. District of Columbia Human Rights Act\n\n               Under the DCHRA, it is unlawful for an employer “[t]o fail or refuse to hire, or to\n\ndischarge, any individual[,] or otherwise to discriminate against any individual, with respect to\n\n[her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including promotion; or to\n\nlimit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\findividual of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect [her] status as an\n\nemployee” on the basis of her race. D.C. Code § 2-1402.11(a)(1). The term “employer” means\n\n“any person who, for compensation, employs an individual,” as well as “any person acting in the\n\ninterest of such employer, directly or indirectly.” D.C. Code § 2-1401.02(10). An individual\n\ntherefore may be held liable personally under the DCHRA if she is acting on behalf of an\n\nemployer. Wallace v. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, 715 A.2d 873, 888 (D.C. 1998)\n\n(finding that the DCHRA applies to individual partners of law firm because the partners acted in\n\nthe interest of the employer, a law partnership); see Zelaya v. UNICCO Serv. Co., 587 F. Supp.\n\n2d 277, 284-85 (D.D.C. 2008) (concluding that plaintiff’s former supervisor can be individually\n\nliable under the DCHRA); Alston v. District of Columbia, 561 F. Supp. 2d 29, 44-45 (D.D.C.\n\n2008) (allowing claim under D.C. Code § 2-1402.41 for discrimination based on disability to\n\nproceed as against agents of the District of Columbia Public Schools, an educational institution\n\ncovered by the DCHRA); MacIntosh v. Bldg. Owners and Managers Ass’n Int’l. 355 F. Supp. 2d\n\n223, 227-28 (D.D.C. 2005) (citing Wallace, denying motion of association’s Executive Director\n\nand a Vice President to dismiss DCHRA claims against them in their individual capacities).\n\n               “The limitation period for a civil action brought pursuant to the [DCHRA] is one\n\nyear.” Jones v. Howard Univ., 574 A.2d 1343, 1345 (D.C. 1990) (citing Davis v. Potomac Elec.\n\nPower Co., 449 A.2d 278, 280-81 (D.C. 1982)). “When a charge of discrimination is filed with\n\nthe EEOC in the District of Columbia, a claim is automatically cross-filed with the D.C. Office\n\nof Human Rights (‘DCOHR’) pursuant to a ‘worksharing agreement’ between the two agencies.”\n\nEllis v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 631 F. Supp. 2d 71, 78 (D.D.C. 2009); Ware v. Nicklin Assocs.,\n\nInc., 580 F. Supp. 2d 158, 164 (D.D.C. 2008) (citing Estenos v. PAHO/WHO Fed. Credit Union,\n\n\n                                               17\n\f952 A.2d 878 (D.C. 2008)); see 29 C.F.R. § 1601.13(a)(4)(ii)(A). The timely filing of a\n\ncomplaint with the DCOHR “toll[s] the running of the statute of limitations while the complaint\n\nis pending,” D.C. Code § 2-1403.16(a), and “the timely filing of a charge with the EEOC, and the\n\nautomatic cross-filing of a claim with the DCOHR that follows, is sufficient to toll the one-year\n\nstatute of limitations for filing a claim under the DCHRA.” Ellis v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp.,\n\n631 F. Supp. 2d at 78 (citations omitted). When plaintiff filed her complaint with the EEOC, she\n\nnamed CNMC as the entity believed to have discriminated against her. The one-year limitations\n\nperiod therefore was tolled as to CNMC.\n\n               Defendants Singh, Morrison-Quintana, Hulbert and Koepenick were not named as\n\nrespondents by plaintiff in her EEOC complaint. They move to dismiss plaintiff’s DCHRA\n\nclaims as untimely – she filed her lawsuit in December 2009, “more than 2 ½ years after the last\n\npossible date that the purported discrimination or retaliation could have occurred.” Defs.’ First\n\nMem. at 9.4 Plaintiff counters that she timely filed her charge of discrimination with the EEOC,\n\nand by doing so she “automatically co-filed” with the DCOHR. Pl.’s First Opp’n at 8; Pl.’s\n\nSecond Opp’n at 7-8. But plaintiff’s charge of discrimination did not name the individual\n\ndefendants as the parties responsible for the discrimination and retaliation she suffered. Plaintiff\n\ncannot now proceed as against the individual defendants on DCHRA claims that were neither\n\nbrought within the one-year statute of limitations nor filed with the EEOC or the DCOHR. The\n\nCourt will dismiss without prejudice plaintiff’s DCHRA claims against defendants Singh,\n\nMorrison-Quintana, Hulbert and Koepenick; these claims may proceed as against CNMC only.\n\n\n\n       4\n           Although defendant Koepenick does not move for dismissal of plaintiff’s\nDCHRA claims on this ground, the others’ argument applies equally to her.\n\n                                                 18\n\f                          C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n\n               Intentional infliction of emotional distress consists of “(1) extreme and outrageous\n\nconduct on the part of the defendant which (2) either intentionally or recklessly (3) cause[d] the\n\nplaintiff severe emotional distress.” Halcomb v. Woods, 610 F. Supp. 2d 77, 80 (D.D.C. 2009)\n\n(citing Larijani v. Georgetown Univ., 791 A.2d 41, 44 (D.C. 2002)); see also The Cuneo Law\n\nGroup, P.C. v. Joseph, 669 F. Supp. 2d 99, 121 (D.D.C. 2009); Evans v. District of Columbia,\n\n391 F. Supp. 2d 160, 170 (D.D.C. 2005). “To establish the required degree of outrageousness [to\n\nsustain an IIED claim], the plaintiff must allege conduct so outrageous in character, and so\n\nextreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as\n\natrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Kerrigan v. Britches of\n\nGeorgetowne, 705 A.2d 624, 628 (D.C. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\nThis “very demanding standard” is “only infrequently met.” Dale v. Thomason, 962 F. Supp.\n\n181, 184 (D.D.C. 1997). “Especially in the employment context, the standard is exacting.”\n\nEvans v. District of Columbia, 391 F. Supp. 2d at 170. “[M]ere insults, indignities, threats,\n\nannoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities” cannot support an IIED claim, Halcomb v.\n\nWoods, 610 F. Supp. 2d at 80 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. d (1965)), and\n\ntermination is not conduct so extreme and outrageous that it exceeds the bounds of decency. See\n\nBrown v. Sim, No. 03-2655, 2005 WL 3276190, at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2005); Elliott v.\n\nHealthcare Corp., 629 A.2d 6, 9 (D.C. 1993); see also Duncan v. Children’s Nat’l Med. Ctr.,\n\n702 A.2d 207, 211-12 (D.C. 1997) ( “[G]enerally, employer-employee conflicts do not rise to the\n\nlevel of outrageous conduct.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\f               Plaintiff’s complaint includes a section titled “Intentional Infliction of Emotional\n\nDistress,” see Compl. at 28-31, in which she describes how her co-workers “were watching [her]\n\nmovements” in order to determine whether her behavior or demeanor violated the terms of the\n\nFinal Written Notice, such that she “arrived at work each day expecting to be fired.” Id. at 28.\n\nDefendants move to dismiss the IIED claim because the complaint alleges neither severe\n\nemotional distress on plaintiff’s part nor conduct rising to the level of outrageousness necessary\n\nto sustain an IIED claim. Defs.’ First Mem. at 9-11; Defs.’ Second Mem. at 10-12.\n\n               That plaintiff “was under a great deal of intentional pressure,” Compl. at 29, does\n\nnot adequately allege that she suffered severe emotional distress. Neither the scrutiny she\n\nendured nor the prospect of immediate termination for a violation of the terms of the Final\n\nWritten Notice comprises conduct “so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go\n\nbeyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in\n\na civilized community.” Bernstein v. Fernandez, 649 A.2d 1064, 1075 (D.C. 1991). The Court\n\nconcludes that the complaint fails to state an IIED claim. The claim therefore will be dismissed\n\nas against all defendants. See Darrow v. Dillingham & Murphy, LLP, 902 A.2d 135, 139 (D.C.\n\n2006) (allegations that office manager was stripped of her duties, blocked from access to billing\n\nsoftware, and employer’s placement of an advertisement for a new office manager did not state\n\nan IIED claim); Crowley v. N. Am. Telecomm. Ass’n, 691 A.2d 1169, 1172 (D.C. 1997)\n\n(allegations that employee “was subjected to contempt, scorn and other indignities in the\n\nworkplace by his supervisor and an unwarranted evaluation and discharge” fail to state an IIED\n\nclaim); Elliott v. Healthcare Corp., 629 A.2d at 9 (employee’s discharge was not extreme and\n\noutrageous as a matter of law).\n\n\n                                                20\n\f                                            D. Negligence\n\n                The basic elements of a negligence claim are that defendant owes plaintiff a duty\n\nof care, defendant breached this duty and thereby caused plaintiff harm. See, e.g., District of\n\nColumbia v. Harris, 770 A.2d 82, 87 (D.C. 2001). Defendants argue that the complaint fails to\n\nstate a negligence claim against them because it lacks allegations regarding a duty of care owed\n\nto plaintiff. Defs.’ First Mem. at 12; Defs.’ Second Mem. at 13. Plaintiff counters that Singh\n\n“owed at minimum[] a duty of fair treatment to [p]laintiff, Pl.’s First Opp’n at 16, as did\n\nKoepenick. Pl.’s Second Opp’n at 23. Plaintiff does not articulate what this duty entails, and\n\ninstead appears to allege that, if there was negligence at all, the actual negligent party was\n\nCNMC. See Compl. at 35-36.\n\n                Insofar as the conduct giving rise to plaintiff’s negligence claims is the same\n\nconduct giving rise to her Title VII claims, the negligence claims appear to be duplicative.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will dismiss the negligence claims without prejudice. See Wade v.\n\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., No. 01-0334, 2005 WL 1513137, at *6 (D.D.C. June 27,\n\n2005) (finding that negligence claim arising from defendant’s alleged failure to assure that\n\ncompany’s “sexual harassment policies were not violated, and more specifically, to assure that\n\n[p]laintiff was not subjected to a hostile work environment . . . is preempted by Title VII as the\n\ninjury arises out of the alleged harassment itself”); Crosten v. Kamauf, 932 F. Supp. 676, 684 (D.\n\nMd. 1996) (dismissing common law negligence claims “to impose liability on [the employer] for\n\nits alleged failure to conform to the dictates of Title VII in its efforts to prevent sexual\n\nharassment, or to properly respond to a report of sexual harassment” because they “merely restate\n\nthe claim brought under Title VII”).\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f                      E. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy\n\n               As noted earlier, the Court presumes that plaintiff is an at-will employee. An\n\nemployer may discharge an at-will employee “at any time and for any reason, or for no reason at\n\nall.” Holman v. Williams, 436 F. Supp. 2d 68, 76 (D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Adams v. George W.\n\nCochran & Co., 597 A.2d 28, 30 (D.C. 1991) (citations omitted)). Under District of Columbia\n\nlaw, however, “wrongful termination in violation of a clear public policy is an exception to the\n\ntraditional at-will employment doctrine.” Bowie v. Gonzales, 433 F. Supp. 2d 24, 30 (D.D.C.\n\n2006) (citing District of Columbia v. Beretta, U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 645 (D.C. 2005)).\n\n“Whether a discharge violates public policy is determined on a case-by-case basis, guided by the\n\nconcept that a wrongful termination cause of action must be ‘firmly anchored in the Constitution\n\nor in a statute or regulation which reflects the particular public policy being relied upon.’” Id.\n\n(quoting Warren v. Coastal Int’l Secs., Inc., 96 Fed. Appx. 722, 722-23 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). For\n\nexample, discharge of an employee who refused to violate a statute – that is, forcing the\n\nemployee to choose between breaking the law and keeping her job – is considered a wrongful\n\ndischarge in violation of public policy. See Adams v. George W. Cochran & Co., Inc., 597 A.2d\n\nat 32, 34.\n\n               Defendants maintain that to successfully invoke this exception, plaintiff must\n\npoint to a “fundamental public policy expressed in a statute, regulation, or constitution that\n\nsupports her position that she was wrongly terminated,” and she has failed to do so. Defs.’\n\nSecond Mem. at 14; see Defs.’ First Mem. at 13. Nor does plaintiff demonstrate a connection\n\nbetween a public policy and the conduct which brought about her termination. Defs.’ First Mem.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fat 13. For plaintiff’s failure “to state a viable wrongful termination claim against [d]efendants,\n\n. . . such claims must be dismissed.” Defs.’ Second Mem. at 14.\n\n               Defendants are correct that the public policy exception to the at-will doctrine must\n\nbe “solidly based on a statute or regulation that reflects the public policy to be applied or (if\n\nappropriate) on a constitutional provision concretely applicable to the defendant’s conduct.”\n\nHolman v. Williams, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 76 (quoting Carl v. Children’s Hosp., 702 A.2d at 163\n\n(Terry, J., concurring)); see also Riggs v. Home Builders Inst., 203 F. Supp. 2d 1, 17 (D.D.C.\n\n2002). Review of the complaint in this case reveals that the only policies allegedly violated were\n\nCNMC’s internal personnel policies regarding employee discipline, grievances, equal\n\nemployment opportunity, harassment, and retaliation. Plaintiff identifies no public policy the\n\nviolation of which contravenes public policy, and therefore the complaint fails to state a wrongful\n\ntermination claim. See Davis v. Gables Residential/H.G. Smithy, 525 F. Supp. 2d 87, 102\n\n(D.D.C. 2007) (dismissing wrongful discharge claim “in the absence of any identified public\n\npolicy” or, alternatively, absent a showing of a “‘close fit’ between the policy and [plaintiff’s]\n\nconduct”); Bowie v. Gonzales, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 31 (concluding that, while “attempts to\n\nstrong-arm plaintiff into supporting [an employee’s] dismissal are not admirable actions, they do\n\nnot rise to the level necessary for a public policy violation supporting an exception to at-will\n\nemployment doctrine in a wrongful termination claim”).\n\n\n                                           F. Defamation\n\n               Plaintiff’s defamation claims arise principally from the comments Morrison-\n\nQuintana allegedly made with respect to plaintiff’s performance and behavior issues occurring\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fprior to January 2007, see Compl. at 31-35, leading to plaintiff’s suspension and the issuance of\n\nthe Final Written Notice, see id. at 33. It appears, however, that plaintiff intends to bring\n\ndefamation claims against all defendants. See id. at 34.\n\n               Under District of Columbia law, “the right to maintain [an] action accrues . . . for\n\nlibel [and] slander” in one year. D.C. Code §12-301(4); see Maupin v. Haylock, 931 A.2d 1039,\n\n1042 (D.C. 2007); Oparaugo v. Watts, 884 A.2d 63, 72 (D.C. 2005). Defendants argue that\n\nplaintiff’s defamation claims are time-barred, as all of the events giving rise to her defamation\n\nclaim arose either before January 3, 2007, or not later than her post-termination exit interview on\n\nMarch 13, 2007. See Defs.’ First Mem. at 11; Defs.’ Second Mem. at 12. Plaintiff counters that\n\nher defamation claims are timely for the same reasons that her DCHRA claims are timely. See\n\nPl.’s Second Opp’n at 23. “Even though the EEOC does not investigate claims of defamation,\n\nthose claims would fall under the DCHRA,” and the statute of limitations is tolled while the\n\nEEOC completes its investigation. Id.\n\n               Defamation is not an unlawful discriminatory practice under the DCHRA, and\n\nplaintiff offers no alternative argument for the tolling of the one-year statute of limitations. Her\n\ndefamation claims, then, will be dismissed without prejudice as untimely. See DiLella v. Univ. of\n\nthe District of Columbia David A. Clark Sch. of Law, 570 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 2008)\n\n(dismissing defamation claim filed 13 months after it had accrued); Nevius v. Africa Inland\n\nMission Int’l, 511 F. Supp. 2d 114, 121 (D.D.C. 2007) (dismissing defamation claim filed nearly\n\nseven months after statute of limitations had run).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f                       G. Appointment of Counsel from the Civil Pro Bono Panel\n\n               The Court’s ruling on defendants’ dispositive motions resolves some, but not all,\n\nof the legal claims plaintiff raises. On the assumption that this case will proceed to discovery,\n\nthe Court considers, sua sponte, whether counsel should be appointed to represent this plaintiff.\n\n               “The law is well established that there is no constitutional right to appointment of\n\ncounsel in a civil case,” Cookish v. Cunningham, 787 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam)\n\n(citations omitted), and no indigent civil litigant is guaranteed counsel. Willis v. Fed. Bureau of\n\nInvestigation, 274 F.3d 531, 532 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The Court has the discretion, however, to\n\nappoint counsel to represent an indigent pro se party under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1). Pursuant to\n\nthis authority, Local Civil Rule 83.11 provides:\n\n               When leave has been granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 for a pro\n               se litigant to proceed in forma pauperis, the judge to whom the case\n               is assigned may, on application by the pro se party or otherwise,\n               appoint an attorney from the Panel to represent such party. The\n               appointment should be made taking into account:\n\n               (I)        the nature and complexity of the action;\n               (ii)       the potential merit of the pro se party’s claims;\n               (iii)      the demonstrated inability of the pro se party to retain counsel\n                          by other means; and\n               (iv)       the degree to which the interests of justice will be served by\n                          appointment of counsel, including the benefit the Court may\n                          derive from the assistance of the appointed counsel.\n\nLCvR 83.11(b)(3); see Willis v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 274 F.3d at 532 (affirming\n\napplication of the factors set forth in the former LCvR 83.11(a)(4)(B) to decide a motion for the\n\nappointment of counsel in a civil action brought under the Freedom of Information Act). The\n\nCourt has considered these factors and determines that appointment of counsel is warranted at\n\nthis time. All proceedings will be stayed pending entry of counsel’s appearance.\n\n\n                                                    25\n\f                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons discussed above, plaintiff’s Title VII and DCHRA claims against\n\ndefendants Singh, Morrison-Quintana, Hulbert and Koepenick in their individual capacities will\n\nbe dismissed. Because the complaint fails to state claims of intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress and wrongful termination in violation of public policy, these claims will be dismissed as\n\nagainst all defendants. Plaintiff’s defamation claims as against all defendants will be dismissed\n\nas untimely, and her negligence claims will be dismissed as duplicative of those brought against\n\nCNMC under Title VII. Remaining, then, are plaintiff’s Title VII and the DCHRA claims\n\nagainst CNMC, and her Section 1981 claims against all defendants. An appropriate Order\n\naccompanies this Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             /s/\n                                             PAUL L.

For the\n\nreasons discussed below, the motions will be granted in part and denied in part.\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n               Plaintiff Jillian Brown, an African-American female, began her employment at\n\nChildren’s Hospital National Medical Center (“CNMC”), Emergency Medical Services for\n\nChildren (“EMSC”), National Resource Center (“NRC”), as a temporary employee in October\n\n2002; she became a permanent employee, an Office Coordinator, in April 2003. Compl. at 8-9.\n\nAmong NRC’s employees were plaintiff’s direct supervisor, Edward Liao, id. at 9, Theresa\n\nMorrison-Quintana, Partnership Outreach Team Leader, see id. at 2, Susan Eads Role, Director\n\nof Partnerships and Public Policy, id. at 3, Jocelyn Hulbert, State Partnership Outreach\n\nCoordinator, id. at 2, 10, and Kenneth Allen, id. at 5, Director of Program Planning and Training,\n\fid. at 22, to whom Morrison-Quintana and Hulbert reported, id. at 12.1 After Liao resigned in\n\nJuly 2006, plaintiff assumed certain of his duties, including supervision of two Administrative\n\nAssistants, Patricia Thompson and Nanette Pierre, both African American. Id. at 7-8. Plaintiff\n\nthen reported directly to the NRC’s Executive Director, Dr. Jane Ball. Id. at 9, 21.\n\n               In the fall of 2006, Dr. Ball announced her retirement effective at the end of that\n\nyear. Compl. at 10. According to plaintiff, Role and Allen “began pressuring [plaintiff] to join,\n\nand later lead, a committee to align itself against Dr. Ball.” Id. Specifically, Role and Allen\n\nintended to coerce Dr. Ball either to appoint one of them as the new Executive Director, or to\n\nappoint both as Co-Directors, by threatening to accuse Dr. Ball of misappropriating federal\n\nfunds. Id. In furtherance of the plot, Role and Allen allegedly sought to obtain plaintiff’s\n\nsignature on a statement attesting to false allegations against Dr. Ball. Id. Plaintiff refused, and\n\ninstead reported these events to Kathryn Koepenick, the NRC’s Senior Human Resources\n\nConsultant, in October 2006. Id. Apparently there was an investigation into Dr. Ball’s activities,\n\nand in November 2006 she was “found . . . innocent.” Id. During the last week of December\n\n2006, Dr. Ball allegedly warned plaintiff that she and Hulbert should “keep a low profile”\n\nbecause Allen had them “on his radar.” Id. Dr. Ball allegedly shared her concerns with Tasmeen\n\nSingh, who became NRC’s Executive Director as of January 1, 2007. Id.\n\n               On January 3, 2007, Singh requested a meeting with plaintiff to discuss\n\n“accusations made against [her] by ‘many/several staff.’” Compl. at 12. Plaintiff was accused of\n\nhaving said that Hulbert earned more than Morrison-Quintana, having forced Morrison-Quintana\n\n\n\n       1\n               Plaintiff has named Theresa Morrison-Quintana and Jocelyn Hulbert as\ndefendants, as well as CNMC, Kathryn Kozpenick, and Tasmeen Singh.\n\n                                                  2\n\fto adjust her telecommuting schedule, and having behaved rudely to others because she was\n\ndissatisfied with her job. Id. According to plaintiff, the events giving rise to these complaints\n\noccurred several years earlier, see id. at 8; yet none had been raised with prior management\n\nbecause plaintiff “was supposedly viewed as ‘intimidating and physically intimidating’ and a\n\n‘favorite’ of [Dr.] Ball.” Id. During this meeting, Singh “made comments that made it obvious\n\nthat she was aware [plaintiff] had filed a charge of discrimination against a former employer\n\nalleging racial discrimination.” Id. at 37. When plaintiff asked who had made complaints\n\nagainst her, Singh responded that the complainant was Thompson, one of the administrative\n\nassistants whom plaintiff supervised; other staff members allegedly confirmed Thompson’s\n\nassertions. Id. at 12. Plaintiff later learned that Morrison-Quintana was her principal accuser.\n\nSee id. at 3, 14, 19.\n\n                Believing that “Dr. Ball’s fears were coming to fruition far sooner than [she]\n\nexpected,” on January 4, 2007, plaintiff called Hulbert to ask whether anyone had asked her\n\nquestions about plaintiff. Compl. at 13. Hulbert responded that, prior to January 3, 2007, Singh\n\n“solicited feedback from her [about plaintiff],” and Hulbert had repeated “what she had heard”\n\nfrom others. Id. Plaintiff allegedly warned Hulbert “to be careful because Dr. Ball . . . had the\n\nsame fears regarding . . . Hulbert.” Id.\n\n                On January 5, 2007, Singh and Koepenick informed plaintiff that she would be\n\nsuspended “for ‘bullying and intimidating’” Hulbert. Compl. at 13. Singh stated that “several\n\nemployees made allegations against [plaintiff],” and because “too many [were] saying the exact\n\nsame thing . . . an investigation would be conducted.” Id. Plaintiff believed that “she was being\n\nsubjected to a hostile work environment because one, or ‘many/several’ employees were making\n\n\n                                                 3\n\ffalse allegations against her, the fabricated allegations were only supported by gossip and\n\nhearsay,” and that no one had any “intention of interviewing, question[ing] or speaking with [her]\n\nto hear her side of the story.” Id. Rather, plaintiff “was already considered to be guilty of the\n\nallegations,” id., and indeed was found “guilty of the allegations, additional transgressions,\n\nand . . . was rude, had communication issues, was a bully, intimidating, physically intimidating,\n\nconfrontational, participates in unprofessional gossip discussions, and was retaliatory.” Id. at 14.\n\n                On January 11, 2007, plaintiff reported to the NRC “to learn of . . . the\n\ninvestigative findings.” Compl. at 14. On that date, Singh issued a Final Written Notice to\n\nplaintiff, id., which in relevant part stated:\n\n                [T]he notice is being issued because of concerns having to do with\n                1. intimidating conduct at the work place and 2. inappropriate\n                communications of confidential information and 3. inappropriate\n                conversations regarding other employees. As your manager, I have\n                learned about this behavior through my investigation and through\n                unsolicited complaints.\n\n                In response to these concerns and complaints, I spoke to you on\n                January 3, 2007 to allow you the opportunity to respond and present\n                your perspective. At the conclusion of this conversation I directed\n                you not to have any conversations regarding our meeting with any\n                staff member. However, the next morning it was brought to my\n                attention that you called a staff member directly to ask if that\n                individual had spoken to me regarding your performance and made\n                comments to that individual about her own job security. As a result\n                of this retaliatory and intimidating behavior, the decision was made\n                to immediately remove you from the workplace by initiating a\n                suspension pending the completion of the investigation. As part of\n                that process, we gave you an opportunity to respond to the complaints\n                made against you.\n\n                At this time, I have formally recommended that we lift the suspension\n                so you can return to work. This notice is to provide you with clear\n                expectations of the sorts of behaviors that are and are not permitted\n                [, and plaintiff was instructed to] refrain from:\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f1.     Conversations with employees about any NRC employee’s\n       salary (including your own) or budget information or any\n       other sensitive employment or contract information.\n\n2.     Unprofessional “gossip” such as discussions about who might\n       get fired or warning employees that they are “next to go” or\n       acting in other ways that lend themselves to a hostile work\n       environment for those around you.\n\n3.     Making inappropriate remarks to co-workers regarding the\n       reasonableness of compensation for NRC staff, the\n       qualifications of employees for their pay grade and job duties,\n       or the productivity of co-workers.\n\n4.     Being confrontational and/or intimidating in your demeanor\n       including the use of an unusually loud tone or the use of\n       physical gestures that may reasonably be construed as\n       intimidating to any employee.\n\n5.     Retaliatory conduct against other employees who may have\n       brought concerns about your conduct to the manager. This\n       includes harassing dialogue with employees such as asking\n       them directly whether they complained, engaging in\n       conversations with any employee about what was said or the\n       terms of the suspension or this final notice, or any other\n       conversations related to the complaints brought against you.\n\n                              * * *\n\nIt is expected that you demonstrate cooperative, courteous and\nprofessional behavior at all times. Any incidents of not responding\nto requests in a reasonable timeframe, or any other inappropriate\nactions/inaction or problematic communication is also not acceptable\nbehavior under the terms of this notice.\n\nWhile it is my sincere intention to work with you in good faith to\novercome these performance issues, I need to be absolutely clear that\nfailure to follow the instructions above, engagement in any form of\nretaliation or any continued performance problem will result in your\nimmediate termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                 5\n\fPl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. #9] (“Pl.’s First Opp’n”), Ex. F (Final\n\nWritten Notice) at 1-2 (emphasis added).2\n\n               On January 16, 2007, plaintiff “filed a complaint with the EEOC and copied . . .\n\nSingh, . . . Koepenick and the Human Resources Department on the complaint.” Compl. at 25;\n\nsee id. at 16, 33. The complaint took the form of correspondence to the Washington Field Office\n\nof the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”). Pl.’s First Opp’n, Ex. J (Letters\n\nfrom plaintiff to EEOC dated January 15, 2007). After describing at length her suspension and\n\nthe Final Written Notice, plaintiff requested that the EEOC “review [her] submission and . . .\n\ninvestigate this tangible employment action, discrimination/disparate treatment, retaliation,\n\nharassment, and hostile work environment.” Id., Ex. J at J2 (page number designated by\n\nplaintiff). Plaintiff submitted an additional letter to the EEOC. See id., Ex. K (Letter from\n\nplaintiff to Hal Budnick, Intake Officer, Washington Field Office, EEOC, dated May 11, 2007).\n\nThe outcome of this exchange is not clear.\n\n               After these events, plaintiff allegedly no longer received group e-mail messages,\n\nwas not notified of mandatory training, was denied access to CNMC’s personnel policies and\n\nwas prevented “from utilizing CNMC’s Employee Complaint process to file internal grievances.”\n\nCompl. at 24. Her workload was increased to include the taking of meeting minutes (previously\n\na task assigned to an employee at a lower grade), making photocopies, and covering the front\n\n\n       2\n                 Singh allegedly “made comments that made it obvious that she was aware that\n[plaintiff] filed a charge of discrimination against a former employer alleging racial\ndiscrimination.” Compl. at 37. These comments may have been made either at the meeting\nduring which the Final Written Notice was issued or at the time plaintiff was notified of her\ntermination. According to plaintiff, both the disciplinary actions taken against her and her\ntermination by RIF were “directly related to her prior protected activity.” Id.\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fdesk when the receptionist was not available, while in other respects she was “stripped . . . of her\n\nduties.” Id. at 25. For example, plaintiff no longer was responsible for processing and\n\nreconciling check and travel requests, id. at 6, was denied access to files containing budget\n\ninformation, id. at 8, was denied a master key which would have given plaintiff access to other\n\nemployees’ offices, id., and otherwise was “held up to all as an employee who could not be\n\ntrusted with keys, files, [and] confidential information[.]” Id. at 22. Singh allegedly “monitored\n\nand questioned [her] every move, evaluated and reevaluated every task [she] performed,\n\nmicromanaged . . ., marginalized [her] within the department, effectively demoted [her] and\n\n[became] an oppressive presence in [her] work environment.” Id. at 25.\n\n               Plaintiff took particular exception to the conditions set forth in the Final Written\n\nNotice directing her to refrain from using a tone of voice or physical gestures that reasonably\n\ncould be construed as intimidating to any employee. In her view, this provision allowed her\n\ncoworkers “to construe [her] movements in any way that they saw fit,” and the terms “were\n\nmeant to humiliate [her] and to place her in a subservient position to her Caucasian coworkers.”\n\nCompl. at 17. She believed that she “was prohibited from using body language,” and [e]ven\n\nthough communication is more nonverbal than verbal, [she] faced immediate termination if it\n\nwere construed that she used any body language.” Id. at 26. She was “in constant fear of losing\n\nher job because the language of the Final Written Notice was so subjective that . . . any employee\n\ncould . . . accuse [her] of ‘being confrontational and/or intimidating in [her] demeanor[.]’” Id. In\n\naddition, according to plaintiff, Singh, Koepenick and some of plaintiff’s co-workers allegedly\n\n“used stereotypes,” describing her “as the loud black woman who rolls her eyes, was angry,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fphysically intimidated everyone, used body language, was a bully and had a problem\n\ncommunicating.” Id. at 16.\n\n               Plaintiff’s employment came to an end on March 5, 2007, at which time Singh\n\nand Koepenick informed her that, “[a]s a result of an internal evaluation of the administrative\n\npersonnel needs at the [NRC], the position of Office Coordinator [was] being eliminated.”\n\nCompl. at 17. Pursuant to a reduction in force (“RIF”), four employees were terminated, three\n\nAfrican American (plaintiff, Thompson and Pierre) and one Caucasian. Id. at 3, 18. Three new\n\nadministrative positions were created, and the position of Staff Assistant “would assume all of\n\nthe prior responsibilities” of plaintiff and the two terminated African-American Administrative\n\nAssistants. Id. According to plaintiff, NRC merely terminated her, changed the position title,\n\nand transferred her responsibilities to a newly titled position, such that she “was terminated via a\n\npretextual RIF.” Id. Plaintiff deemed her termination by RIF the culmination of a series of\n\n“numerous negative tangible employment actions,” Compl. at 19, designed to accomplish what\n\notherwise could not have occurred under the prevailing law.

A (Charge of Discrimination,\n\nNo. 570-2007-00866 dated July 12, 2007). According to the charge, plaintiff alleged that CNMC\n\ndiscriminated against her on the basis of her race and in retaliation for prior EEO activity\n\nbetween January 3, 2007 and March 13, 2007. Id., Ex. A. CNMC allegedly was responsible for\n\n“Race-Based and Retaliatory Discrimination; Retaliation; Harassment; Intentional Infliction Of\n\nEmotional Distress; Hostile Work Environment; Adverse/Tangible Employment Actions\n\n(Heightened Scrutiny, Disparate Treatment, Decreased Responsibilities, Reprimand, Negative\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fEvaluation, Demotion, Discharge); Pretextual Argument For My Termination; Constructive\n\nTermination; Actual termination (by way of the pretextual RIF[]).” Id., Attach. at 2.3 The EEOC\n\nwas “unable to conclude that the information obtained [during its investigation] establishes\n\nviolations” of the applicable employment discrimination statutes. Compl., Ex.

Code § 1-1402.01 et\n\nseq. In addition, she brings common law claims of defamation, negligence, intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress (“IIED”), and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Plaintiff\n\ndemands that any reference to her suspension and final written notice be expunged from her\n\npersonnel file, that each defendant send plaintiff a letter of apology, and that a letter of reprimand\n\nbe placed in each individual defendant’s personnel file.

Title VII\n\n               Under Title VII, it is “an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail\n\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\n\nindividual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n\nbecause of [her] race[.]” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Nor may an employer discriminate against\n\nan employee who has opposed an unlawful employment practice by making a charge, testifying,\n\nassisting or participating in an investigation or proceeding arising from a violation of Title VII.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). This language identifies “two elements for an employment\n\ndiscrimination case: (I) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action (ii) because of [her]\n\nrace” or prior protected activity. Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187112\"><a href=\"/opinion/187112/brady-v-office-of-sergeant-at-arms/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n               Defendants represent that the complaint “goes on for pages concerning the alleged\n\nharassing and retaliatory conduct [plaintiff] claims she experienced,” Defs. Children’s Nat’l\n\nMed. Ctr. and Kathryn Kopenick’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Second Mem.”)\n\n[Dkt. # 12-1] at 7, focusing on “her purported unfair treatment after . . . Singh became director of\n\nher department in January 2007.” Id. at 7-8. Yet, defendants continue, plaintiff’s “allegations of\n\nracial discrimination and retaliation are belied by her own factual assertions,” id. at 8, principally\n\nthose which “tie the alleged disciplinary action and purported hostile conduct . . . to her prior\n\nrelationship with the former department head,” id., her refusal to participate in a scheme to\n\nappoint the new Director of the NRC, id., and retribution for supporting Dr. Ball. Id. at 9.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f                 Defendants’ reading of the complaint is overly narrow and appears to ignore\n\nplaintiff’s awkward but perceptible efforts to tie defendants’ adverse employment actions to her\n\nrace. For example, plaintiff alleges that she, “an African-American employee of . . . CNMC, was\n\ntreated in a manner different from her similarly situated coworkers, and was subjected to . . .\n\nCNMC’s altering the terms and conditions of her employment.” Compl. at 15. She also alleges\n\nthat the RIF was a pretext for discrimination against her and other African American employees.\n\nId.; see id. at 17-19, 30. And with her assertion that “the disciplinary actions taken against her\n\nand the termination of her employment from CNMC . . . [were] directly related to her prior\n\nprotected activity,” Compl. at 37; see id. at 25, 33, plaintiff manages to allege a claim of\n\nretaliation in violation of Title VII. It matters not that plaintiff failed to “specifically mention\n\nrace-based discrimination until many pages into her Complaint.” Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.\n\nChildren’s Nat’l Med. Ctr.’s and Kathryn Koepenick’s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. #14] (“Pl.’s Second\n\nOpp’n”) at 21.\n\n                 As the Court construes the complaint, plaintiff alleges that defendants both\n\ndiscriminated against her on the basis of her race and retaliated against her by suspending her, by\n\nissuing a Final Written Notice, and by terminating her through a pretextual RIF. The complaint\n\nis not a model of clarity; it is rambling, disorganized and repetitive. But it is also prepared by a\n\npro se plaintiff and its allegations must be construed liberally. See Haines v. Kerner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520 (1972); Atherton v.

Notwithstanding the\n\nimprecise and inartful drafting, plaintiff’s complaint goes beyond mere conclusory statements\n\nand sets forth specific factual allegations that tend to support her causes of action. In other\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fwords, the complaint does not “stop[] short of the line between possibility and plausibility of\n\nentitlement to relief.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.\n\n               Moreover, plaintiff’s obligation at the pleading stage is to put defendants on\n\nnotice of the claims against them and the bases on which they rest. Plaintiff accomplishes this\n\ntask; she need not plead all the facts she ultimately must prove in order to prevail on the merits.\n\nSee Atchison v.

They move to dismiss plaintiff’s DCHRA\n\nclaims as untimely – she filed her lawsuit in December 2009, “more than 2 ½ years after the last\n\npossible date that the purported discrimination or retaliation could have occurred.” Defs.’ First\n\nMem. at 9.4 Plaintiff counters that she timely filed her charge of discrimination with the EEOC,\n\nand by doing so she “automatically co-filed” with the DCOHR. Pl.’s First Opp’n at 8; Pl.’s\n\nSecond Opp’n at 7-8. But plaintiff’s charge of discrimination did not name the individual\n\ndefendants as the parties responsible for the discrimination and retaliation she suffered.

Defamation\n\n               Plaintiff’s defamation claims arise principally from the comments Morrison-\n\nQuintana allegedly made with respect to plaintiff’s performance and behavior issues occurring\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fprior to January 2007, see Compl. at 31-35, leading to plaintiff’s suspension and the issuance of\n\nthe Final Written Notice, see id. at 33. It appears, however, that plaintiff intends to bring\n\ndefamation claims against all defendants. See id. at 34.\n\n               Under District of Columbia law, “the right to maintain [an] action accrues . . . for\n\nlibel [and] slander” in one year. D.C. Code §12-301(4); see Maupin v. Haylock, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1042 (D.C. 2007); Oparaugo v.

Defendants argue that\n\nplaintiff’s defamation claims are time-barred, as all of the events giving rise to her defamation\n\nclaim arose either before January 3, 2007, or not later than her post-termination exit interview on\n\nMarch 13, 2007. See Defs.’ First Mem. at 11; Defs.’ Second Mem. at 12. Plaintiff counters that\n\nher defamation claims are timely for the same reasons that her DCHRA claims are timely. See\n\nPl.’s Second Opp’n at 23. “Even though the EEOC does not investigate claims of defamation,\n\nthose claims would fall under the DCHRA,” and the statute of limitations is tolled while the\n\nEEOC completes its investigation. Id.\n\n               Defamation is not an unlawful discriminatory practice under the DCHRA, and\n\nplaintiff offers no alternative argument for the tolling of the one-year statute of limitations. Her\n\ndefamation claims, then, will be dismissed without prejudice as untimely. See DiLella v. Univ. of\n\nthe District of Columbia David A.

Cir. 2001). The Court has the discretion, however, to\n\nappoint counsel to represent an indigent pro se party under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1). Pursuant to\n\nthis authority, Local Civil Rule 83.11 provides:\n\n               When leave has been granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 for a pro\n               se litigant to proceed in forma pauperis, the judge to whom the case\n               is assigned may, on application by the pro se party or otherwise,\n               appoint an attorney from the Panel to represent such party. The\n               appointment should be made taking into account:\n\n               (I)        the nature and complexity of the action;\n               (ii)       the potential merit of the pro se party’s claims;\n               (iii)      the demonstrated inability of the pro se party to retain counsel\n                          by other means; and\n               (iv)       the degree to which the interests of justice will be served by\n                          appointment of counsel, including the benefit the Court may\n                          derive from the assistance of the appointed counsel.\n\nLCvR 83.11(b)(3); see Willis v.

Bureau of Investigation, 274 F.3d at 532 (affirming\n\napplication of the factors set forth in the former LCvR 83.11(a)(4)(B) to decide a motion for the\n\nappointment of counsel in a civil action brought under the Freedom of Information Act). The\n\nCourt has considered these factors and determines that appointment of counsel is warranted at\n\nthis time. All proceedings will be stayed pending entry of counsel’s appearance.\n\n\n                                                    25\n\f                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons discussed above, plaintiff’s Title VII and DCHRA claims against\n\ndefendants Singh, Morrison-Quintana, Hulbert and Koepenick in their individual capacities will\n\nbe dismissed. Because the complaint fails to state claims of intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress and wrongful termination in violation of public policy, these claims will be dismissed as\n\nagainst all defendants. Plaintiff’s defamation claims as against all defendants will be dismissed\n\nas untimely, and her negligence claims will be dismissed as duplicative of those brought against\n\nCNMC under Title VII. Remaining, then, are plaintiff’s Title VII and the DCHRA claims\n\nagainst CNMC, and her Section 1981 claims against all defendants. An appropriate Order\n\naccompanies this Opinion.\n\n\n\n                                             /s/\n                                             PAUL L.
