Lekar, Judge.\n\n\n\n      Property insurer seeks further review of court of appeals decision\n\nreversing summary judgment upholding denial of coverage for damage\n\nfrom rainwater spilling from corroded drainpipe that failed during storm.\n\nDECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS VACATED; DISTRICT COURT\n\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n      Samuel C. Anderson and Joseph G. Martin of Swisher & Cohrt,\n\nP.L.C., Waterloo, for appellant.\n\n\n\n      Mark W. Thomas of Grefe & Sidney, P.L.C., Des Moines, for\n\nappellee.\n\f                                     2\n\nWATERMAN, Justice.\n\n      In this appeal, we must decide whether a business insurance\n\npolicy covers water damage inside a building resulting when a corroded\n\ninterior drainpipe bursts during a summer rainstorm. The pipe carried\n\nrainwater from the roof to a storm sewer.         The policy only insures\n\ndamage “caused by rain” if an insured event first ruptures the roof or\n\nexterior walls to allow the rain to enter or if the damage results from\n\nmelting ice or snow. The district court granted summary judgment for\n\nthe insurer, concluding the water damage was caused by rain. The court\n\nof appeals reversed, concluding that damage from “rainwater” flowing\n\nfrom the broken interior drainpipe is not damage “caused by rain.” We\n\ngranted the insurer’s application for further review.\n\n      This case presents our first opportunity to adjudicate coverage\n\nclaims under a rain limitation in an insurance policy. For the reasons\n\nexplained below, we conclude the unambiguous language of the rain\n\nlimitation precludes coverage for the damage caused by the rainwater\n\nescaping the ruptured interior drainpipe. We, like the district court, also\n\nreject the insured’s alternative argument that coverage is available\n\nbecause the damage resulted from the “breaking or cracking of any part\n\nof a system containing water or steam.” That argument fails because the\n\npolicy does not provide coverage for damage “caused by rain,” even if a\n\nsystem containing water was involved. We therefore vacate the decision\n\nof the court of appeals and affirm the district court’s summary judgment\n\nin favor of the insurer.\n\n      I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      Amish Connection, Inc. leased space in Crossroads Shopping Mall\n\nin Waterloo, where it operated the Amish Connection Store.       In 2008,\n\nAmish Connection moved into Suite 102. This litigation arises from the\n\f                                    3\n\nfailure of a leaky four-inch cast-iron drainpipe that ran above the ceiling\n\ntiles and along the interior back wall. This pipe connected to the rooftop\n\ndrains and carried rainwater down and through the interior of the\n\nbuilding to a storm sewer.       During heavy rains, leaking rainwater\n\nroutinely ran down the back wall of the suite. To address the leakage,\n\nmall management installed a makeshift wooden trough to catch the\n\nrainwater from the back wall and direct it toward a drain. The drainage\n\ntile and pipe system in Suite 102 showed “trails of rust left by years of\n\nwater leak issues.” The drainpipe was hidden from the tenant’s view by\n\nceiling tiles and wallboard, and Amish Connection was unaware that it\n\nleaked.   The drainpipe itself was “extremely rusty” before it failed.\n\nSubsequent photos show extensive corrosion on the pipe, especially\n\nwhere it joined the wall.\n\n      In May 2010, the owner of Amish Connection approached the mall\n\nmanager about closing the store until November “because business was\n\nbad.” New lease contracts were prepared to allow Amish Connection to\n\nclose its business to the public through October and reopen November 1.\n\nDuring that period, Amish Connection would continue paying rent for\n\nSuite 102 and store property there.        On June 14, the new lease\n\nagreements were executed. It rained heavily that night. The rainstorm\n\ncaused no damage to the roof, windows, or exterior walls of the building.\n\nThe next morning, however, the mall maintenance staff discovered the\n\ninterior drainpipe had failed, flooding the back room of Suite 102 with up\n\nto several inches of rainwater and soaking the carpet in much of the\n\nfront showroom.     The rainwater caused substantial damage to Amish\n\nConnection’s office, bathroom, and property stored there, including its\n\nsamples, inventory, office supplies, and business records.\n\f                                      4\n\n      Amish Connection promptly submitted a claim under its business\n\ninsurance policy with State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State\n\nFarm). Section I of the policy, entitled “LOSSES INSURED AND LOSSES\n\nNOT INSURED,” provides:\n\n      We insure for accidental direct physical loss to property\n      covered under this policy unless the loss is:\n             1.     limited in the PROPERTY            SUBJECT    TO\n                    LIMITATIONS section; or\n             2.     excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section\n                    that follows.\n\nThe relevant provisions of those two sections state:\n\n      PROPERTY SUBJECT\n      TO LIMITATIONS\n      We will not pay for loss:\n             ....\n             6.     to the interior of any building or structure, or\n                    the property inside any building or structure,\n                    caused by rain, snow, sleet, ice, sand, or dust,\n                    whether driven by wind or not, unless:\n                    a.     the building or structure first sustains\n                           damage by an insured loss to its roof or\n                           walls through which the rain, snow, sleet,\n                           ice, sand or dust enters; or\n                    b.     the loss is caused by thawing of snow,\n                           sleet or ice on the building or structure\n                           ....\n      ....\n      LOSSES NOT INSURED\n             ....\n             2.     We do not insure for loss either consisting of, or\n                    directly and immediately caused by, one or more\n                    of the following:\n                    ....\n                    d.     smog, wear, tear, rust, corrosion, fungus,\n                           mold, decay, deterioration, hidden or\n                           latent defect or any quality in property\n                           that causes it to damage or destroy itself.\n                           But if accidental direct physical loss by\n                           any of the \"Specified Causes of Loss\" or by\n\f                                    5\n                         building glass breakage results, we will\n                         pay for that resulting loss . . . .\n\nThe definitions section of the policy defined “Specified Causes of Loss” to\ninclude:\n\n             14.   water damage, meaning accidental discharge or\n                   leakage of water or steam as the direct result of\n                   the breaking or cracking of any part of a system\n                   or appliance containing water or steam.\n\n      On June 16, State Farm declined Amish Connection’s claim based\n\non the rain limitation in paragraph 6 of the property subject to\n\nlimitations section.   On December 27, Amish Connection filed a civil\n\naction against its landlord and the mall operator alleging they had\n\nconcealed the water infiltration problem the tenant discovered when\n\nceiling tiles were removed after the drainpipe failed. Amish Connection\n\nalleged those defendants “took insufficient efforts to remedy the water\n\ninfiltration problem and Defendants’ actions caused further water\n\ndamage to the lower level unit #102.”     The lawsuit further alleged the\n\nmall owner and operator “were guilty of gross negligence and willful\n\nmisconduct by renting [Suite 102] while knowing of, not disclosing, and\n\nnot taking remedial action to resolve the significant long-standing water\n\nproblems.”\n\n      On November 23, 2011, counsel for Amish Connection wrote to\n\nState Farm asking it to reconsider its denial of the claim and provide\n\ncoverage for the water damage. State Farm responded on December 22\n\nthat it would investigate further and cited paragraph 2(d) excluding\n\ncoverage for “rust, corrosion, . . . and deterioration,” in addition to the\n\nrain limitation in paragraph 6. On January 3, 2012, State Farm sent\n\nanother letter confirming its denial of coverage based on both provisions.\n\nOn January 20, Amish Connection moved to amend its petition to add\n\f                                   6\n\nState Farm as a defendant to a claim of breach of its insurance contract.\n\nAmish Connection later dismissed its claims against the mall owner and\n\noperator. The lawsuit proceeded against State Farm alone.\n\n      On July 27, State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment\n\nbased on paragraph 6 excluding coverage for “damage caused by rain.”\n\nAmish Connection resisted, arguing that the water damaging the interior\n\nof Suite 102 was no longer “rain,” and the actual cause of the loss was\n\nthe failure of the drainage pipe, falling within coverage under paragraph\n\n14. On October 18, the district court granted State Farm’s motion based\n\non paragraph 6, stating “as a matter of law the water running through\n\nthe pipe which caused the loss was rainwater.”        Amish Connection\n\nmoved for a more specific ruling to address its alternative argument\n\nunder the exception to the rust-and-corrosion exclusion for water\n\ndamage resulting from the “breaking or cracking of any part of a system\n\nor appliance containing water or steam.” State Farm resisted, arguing\n\nthat the ruling on the rain limitation was dispositive under the language\n\nof the insuring agreement that provides coverage for accidents “unless\n\nthe loss is: 1. limited [by the rain limitation]; or 2. Excluded in the\n\nLosses Not Insured section.” On December 20, the district court agreed\n\nwith State Farm’s interpretation and denied Amish Connection’s motion,\n\nstating:\n\n      The policy reads that “We insure for accidental physical loss\n      to property covered under this policy unless the loss is: 1)\n      Limited in the PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS\n      section; or 2) Excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED\n      section that follows.” (Emphasis Added). Therefore, if a loss\n      is excluded under either the PROPERTY SUBJECT TO\n      LIMITATIONS section or the LOSSES NOT INSURED section,\n      then it is excluded, and analysis under the other section is\n      not necessary. Therefore, the Court declines to rule on\n      whether the LOSSES NOT INSURED provision applies, as\n      the loss is already excluded by the other section.\n\f                                     7\n\n      Amish Connection appealed, and we transferred the case to the\n\ncourt of appeals. The court of appeals reversed the summary judgment,\n\nconcluding the “district court erred by finding the rain limitation [in\n\nparagraph 6] was applicable to this case.” The court of appeals, citing\n\ndictionaries and cases from other jurisdictions, distinguished “rain” from\n\n“rainwater”:\n\n      The definitions of “rain” and “rainwater,” although similar,\n      encompass two different points in time. As water is falling, it\n      is considered “rain.” After it has fallen—and, as here, been\n      collected on a rooftop and channeled into pipes for transport\n      to a storm sewer—it is considered “rainwater.”. . . While the\n      water emitting from the burst pipe may fall within the\n      definition of “rainwater,” it does not fall within the definition\n      of “rain”. Because loss caused by “rainwater” is not excluded\n      or otherwise limited under the policy, the district court erred\n      in interpolating the term “rainwater” into the policy and\n      concluding the interpolated term was unambiguous.\n\n      The court of appeals further concluded to the extent the limitation\n\nof coverage for damage “caused by rain” in paragraph 6 is ambiguous, it\n\nmust be construed against State Farm. The court of appeals determined\n\nthe parties’ arguments under other terms of the policy “are best\n\naddressed by the district court in the first instance” on remand.         We\n\ngranted State Farm’s application for further review.\n\n      II. Standard of Review.\n\n      We review a district court’s summary judgment ruling that\n\ninterprets an insurance policy for correction of errors at law. Boelman v.\n\nGrinnell Mut. Reins. Co., 826 N.W.2d 494, 500 (Iowa 2013). Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact\n\nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at\n\n501 (citing Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.981(3)). We may affirm summary judgment\n\non a conflict “concerning only the legal consequences of undisputed\n\f                                      8\n\nfacts.”   Id.   We examine the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party. Id.\n\n      III. Analysis.\n\n      This case presents our court’s first opportunity to adjudicate an\n\ninsurance claim under a policy limiting coverage for losses “caused by\n\nrain.” The facts are undisputed as to the source of the water damage—a\n\ncorroded interior drainpipe burst during a rainstorm, flooding the rooms\n\ninside with rainwater.    The fighting issue is whether the damage was\n\n“caused by rain” within the meaning of paragraph 6 of the limitations of\n\ncoverage. Neither side has offered any extrinsic evidence on the meaning\n\nof the insurance contract. Accordingly, its interpretation is for the court\n\nto decide. See id. (“Policy interpretation is always an issue for the court,\n\nunless we are required to rely upon extrinsic evidence or choose between\n\nreasonable inferences from extrinsic evidence.”).       We conclude State\n\nFarm was entitled to summary judgment in its favor based on the\n\nlimitation of coverage. Our holding is consistent with the decisions of\n\nother courts construing equivalent policy language.\n\n      Our rules governing the construction and interpretation of\n\ninsurance policies are well-settled. “The cardinal principle . . . is that the\n\nintent of the parties at the time the policy was sold must control.”\n\nLeMars Mut. Ins. Co. v. Joffer, 574 N.W.2d 303, 307 (Iowa 1998). Except\n\nin cases of ambiguity, we determine “the intent of the parties by looking\n\nat what the policy itself says.” Boelman, 826 N.W.2d at 501. If a term is\n\nnot defined in the policy, we give the words their ordinary meaning. Id.\n\n“We will not strain the words or phrases of the policy in order to find\n\nliability that the policy did not intend and the insured did not purchase.”\n\nId.\n\f                                      9\n\n      “[A] policy is ambiguous if the language is susceptible to two\n\nreasonable interpretations” when the contract is read as a whole. Id. “If\n\nthe policy is ambiguous, we adopt the construction most favorable to the\n\ninsured.” Id. at 502. “An insurance policy is not ambiguous, however,\n\njust because the parties disagree as to the meaning of its terms.”         Id.\n\nMoreover, “ ‘[a]mbiguity is not present merely because the provision\n\n“could have been worded more clearly or precisely than it in fact was.” ’ ”\n\nAm. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Corrigan, 697 N.W.2d 108, 114 (Iowa 2005)\n\n(quoting Cairns v. Grinnell Mut. Reins. Co., 398 N.W.2d 821, 824 (Iowa\n\n1987)).   “If an insurance policy and its exclusions are clear, the court\n\n‘will not “write a new contract of insurance” ’ for the parties.” Boelman,\n\n826 N.W.2d at 502 (quoting Thomas v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 749\n\nN.W.2d 678, 682 (Iowa 2008)). We construe exclusions strictly against\n\nthe insurer.     Id.    Nevertheless, “we must enforce unambiguous\n\nexclusions as written.”    Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Sand Livestock Sys.,\n\nInc., 728 N.W.2d 216, 222 (Iowa 2007).\n\n      A. The Rain Limitation.         Applying these principles here, we\n\nconclude the rain limitation in paragraph 6 unambiguously defeats\n\ncoverage for the rainwater damage to Suite 102. This provision states\n\nthat subject to two exceptions the insurer “will not pay for loss . . . to the\n\ninterior of any building . . . or the property inside . . . caused by rain.”\n\nNeither exception applies. The first allows coverage if “the building . . .\n\nfirst sustains damage by an insured loss to its roof or walls through\n\nwhich the rain . . . enters.”   This exception would allow coverage, for\n\nexample, if a tornado dropped a tree on the roof, opening a hole through\n\nwhich rain entered.       Amish Connection alleges no damage to the\n\nbuilding’s roof or walls through which rain entered Suite 102. Rather,\n\nthe rainwater damage occurred when the interior drainpipe failed. The\n\f                                     10\n\nsecond exception to the rain limitation provision allows coverage if “the\n\nloss is caused by thawing of snow, sleet or ice on the building or\n\nstructure.” The June rainstorm involved no thawing of precipitates.\n\n      Amish Connection acknowledges these exceptions do not apply,\n\nbut argues the water damage in suite 102 was not “caused by rain”\n\nwithin the meaning of paragraph 6. It contends the water escaping the\n\nruptured drainpipe was no longer “rain” but rather “rainwater.”         The\n\ncourt of appeals agreed, stating, “We think it fair to say that a reasonable\n\nperson standing in the interior of a shopping mall underneath a burst\n\ndrainpipe would not conclude that he or she was standing in the ‘rain.’ ”\n\nTrue enough. But, “rainwater” unquestionably is “caused by rain,” and it\n\nis undisputed the water damage occurred during a rainstorm when the\n\ndrainpipe ruptured to spill rainwater into Suite 102.       We hold as a\n\nmatter of law that water damage is “caused by rain” within the meaning\n\nof paragraph 6 of the limitations of coverage when an interior drainpipe\n\nfails during a rainstorm and releases rainwater inside the building.\n\n      Under common parlance, damage caused by “rainwater” is “caused\n\nby rain.” If water is only considered rain while it is falling and becomes\n\nrainwater after it strikes a surface then the policy’s limitation on\n\ncoverage for damage “caused by rain” would be eviscerated. Water does\n\nnot damage property while merely falling through the air, but only after it\n\nstrikes a surface.   Under the court of appeals’ interpretation, the rain\n\nlimitation in the policy would be superfluous, and the coverage for\n\nrainwater damage would extend to leaky roofs and skylights. See Iowa\n\nFuel & Minerals, Inc. v. Iowa State Bd. of Regents, 471 N.W.2d 859, 863\n\n(Iowa 1991) (“[A]n interpretation which gives a reasonable, lawful, and\n\neffective meaning to all terms is preferred to an interpretation which\n\nleaves a part unreasonable, unlawful, or of no effect.”).\n\f                                    11\n\n      State Farm argues its commercial property insurance policy is not\n\nintended to provide coverage for damage resulting from deferred\n\nmaintenance. Other courts have agreed. In Petrick v. State Farm Fire &\n\nCasualty Co.,    the   New Jersey   appellate   court   affirmed   summary\n\njudgment for the insurer based on a rain limitation and noted insurance\n\nis not intended to pay costs resulting from poor maintenance:\n\n      If that coverage were found to exist, State Farm would\n      become the insurer of all water damage to personalty caused\n      by inadequate or delayed maintenance of a premises. That\n      is clearly a risk that the insurer did not agree and could not\n      reasonably be found to assume. We will not write for\n      plaintiffs a better policy of insurance than the one\n      purchased.\n\nNo. A-1152-09T3, 2010 WL 3257894, *5 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.\n\nAug. 13, 2010) (per curiam); see also Dashtpeyma v. Liberty Mut. Grp.,\n\n569 F. App’x 886, 887 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (affirming summary\n\njudgment for insurer based on rain limitation “when rain water leaked\n\nthrough rotted wood on window sills and pieces of siding”).            It is\n\nundisputed that the drainpipe that failed in Suite 102 was rusty,\n\ncorroded, and leaky for a long period preceding the rainstorm during\n\nwhich it ruptured. This is not an insured loss under the rain limitation\nin State Farm’s policy.\n\n      Other courts have reached the same result we do under equivalent\n\npolicy language. In Horizon III Real Estate v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co.,\n\nthe insured’s office basement flooded during a torrential rainstorm that\n\noverwhelmed the building’s interior drainpipes or the connecting storm\n\nsewer system.    186 F. Supp. 2d 1000, 1002 (D. Minn. 2002).            The\n\ninsurance policy contained a rain limitation like State Farm’s that\n\nprovided no coverage for damage to the “interior of any building . . .\n\ncaused by or resulting from rain.” Id. at 1005. The insured, like Amish\n\f                                    12\n\nConnection, argued the rain “stopped being ‘rain’ when it touched the\n\nroof,” as it was no longer falling from the sky. Id. at 1006. The federal\n\ndistrict court rejected that argument, concluding the water damage “was\n\ncaused by or resulted from, a torrential rain storm” within the meaning\n\nof the “unambiguous” rain limitation. Id. at 1006–07. Accordingly, the\n\ncourt entered summary judgment for the insurer. Id. at 1002, 1009.\n\n      The Nebraska Court of Appeals, applying the same rain limitation\n\nin a business policy, likewise rejected the argument that rain is no longer\n\nrain once it lands on a rooftop:\n\n      [The insured] first argues that the damage he suffered was\n      not caused by rain, on the theory that the water which\n      entered his building had lost its nature as “rain” once it\n      entered the building. We are unswayed by this tortured\n      reading of a clearly worded exclusion. [The insured] does not\n      deny that rain fell and that the water resulting from that\n      rain, however characterized, entered the building. The policy\n      excludes damage “caused by or resulting from rain,” which is\n      precisely what happened in this case.\n\nEinspahr v. United Fire & Cas. Co., No. A-99-371, 2000 WL 758654, at\n\n*4, *6 (Neb. Ct. App. June 13, 2000) (affirming summary judgment for\n\ninsurer); accord Stufflebean v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., 710 S.W.2d 931,\n\n933 (Mo. Ct. App. 1986) (holding rain limitation excluded coverage for\n\nwater damage resulting from broken gutter); Kennel Delites, Inc. v T.L.S.\n\nNYC Real Estate, LLC, 852 N.Y.S.2d 130, 130–31 (App. Div. 2008)\n\n(applying exclusion for damage “caused by rain” when rainwater leaked\n\ninto building after debris clogged roof drain); U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v.\n\nMatchoolian, 583 S.W.2d 692, 694 (Tex. Ct. App. 1979) (same). But see\n\nFidelity Coop. Bank v. Nova Cas. Co., 726 F.3d 31, 40–41 (1st Cir. 2013)\n\n(holding water damage resulting from clogged roof drain was covered\n\nunder amendatory flood endorsement notwithstanding rain limitation in\n\noriginal policy); id. at 42 (Kayatta, J., concurring in part and dissenting\n\f                                        13\n\nin part) (“[C]overage would not exist here but for the amendatory\n\nendorsement for flood coverage.”).\n\n       The court of appeals relied on State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v.\n\nPaulson for its conclusion that rain is “water falling from the sky.” 756\n\nP.2d 764, 767 (Wyo. 1988) (“ ‘Rain’ is ordinarily and commonly thought\n\nof as water falling from the sky. After it stops falling, one does not say\n\nthat it is ‘raining’ . . . .”).   That case is inapposite.   In Paulson, the\n\ninsured’s basement windows were broken by hail, allowing water from a\n\nrainstorm to flow in through the broken windows. Id. at 764. The policy\n\ncontained a separate exclusion for damage from “flood [or] surface\n\nwater.” Id. at 765. Under the plain language of this exclusion, water\n\nfrom the rainstorm that landed on nearby higher ground was “surface\n\nwater” when it flowed into the basement windows. Id. at 771–72. The\n\nPaulson court distinguished rain from rainwater to hold the surface\n\nwater exclusion precluded coverage, not to avoid the rain limitation. See\n\nid.\n\n       The court of appeals also relied on Unobskey v. Continental\n\nInsurance Co., which is also inapposite.       86 A.2d 160 (Me. 1952).    In\n\nUnobskey, the outside door to a retail shop was “torn open” during “a\n\nvery severe storm with high wind and heavy rain.” Id. at 160–61. “[A]\n\n‘river’ of water went through the doorway” and damaged inventory stored\n\nin the basement. Id. at 161. The policy covered damage from wind but\n\nexcluded coverage for damage from “ ‘high water or overflow whether\n\ndriven by wind or not.’ ” Id. at 163. The court affirmed judgment for the\n\ninsurer because the policy “did not cover the damage caused by running\n\nsurface water from rainstorm and melting snow[] that overflowed the\n\ncatch basins and the parking area.” Id. at 164. Such cases adjudicating\n\nsurface water exclusions are inapplicable regardless of whether the water\n\f                                           14\n\ncausing damage accumulated in a rainstorm. 1                 The rainwater causing\n\ndamage to Suite 102 had not reached the outside ground to become\n\nsurface water. Flooding from surface water presents a different risk than\n\nrainwater landing on a building.\n\n       B. The “Water System” Exception to the Rust-and-Corrosion\n\nExclusion. Because the rain limitation is dispositive, we, like the district\n\ncourt, reject Amish Connection’s alternative argument for coverage based\n\non paragraph 14 of the definitions.             That provision defines “Specified\n\nCauses of Loss” 2 to include: “water damage, meaning accidental\n\n         1The cases that Amish Connection relies upon are likewise inapposite. Amish\n\nConnection cites two cases for the proposition that water may change its character by\nentering an artificial channel. Heller v. Fire Ins. Exch., 800 P.2d 1006, 1009 (Colo.\n1990) (concluding that runoff is no longer surface water when diverted into trenches);\nGeorgetowne Square v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 523 N.W.2d 380, 386–87 (Neb. Ct. App.\n1994) (holding water ceases to be “surface water” when forced into an artificial trench).\nBoth of these cases deal with surface water rather than rainwater, and both rely on\nprecedent in their respective jurisdictions holding that “surface water” is not channeled\nartificially.  See Heller, 800 P.2d at 1008–09 & nn.3–10 (surveying caselaw);\nGeorgetowne Square, 523 N.W.2d at 385 (“The cases in Nebraska also emphasize that\nthe definition of surface water involves the ‘natural’ drainage of such water.”). By\ncontrast, other courts have held that surface water does not change status for coverage\npurposes when it flows into a man-made channel or underground. Cameron v. USAA\nProp. & Cas. Ins. Co., 733 A.2d 965, 969–70 (D.C. Ct. App. 1999) (concluding water\nflowing from a patio remained “surface water” even though it passed over an artificial\nchannel intended to direct the water’s course); State ex rel. State Fire & Tornado Fund of\nN.D. Ins. Dep’t v. N.D. State Univ., 694 N.W.2d 225, 233 (N.D. 2005) ( stating “surface\nwater does not lose its character as surface water simply by being artificially channeled\nunderground”).\n       2The   State Farm policy uses the term “Specified Causes of Loss” in some\nprovisions and the term “insured loss” in others. We read the policy as a whole.\nBoelman, 826 N.W.2d at 501. The terms are not coextensive. See Chiodo v. Section\n43.24 Panel, 846 N.W.2d 845, 853 (Iowa 2014) (“If the drafters intended the two\nconcepts to be coextensive, different words would not have been used.”); Andover Vill.\nRet. Cmty. v. Cole, No. 2013-A-0057, 2014 WL 5802674, at *3 (Ohio Ct. App. 2014)\n(“Generally in interpreting a statute or a contract, we presume that the use of different\nwords indicates an intention that the words possess different meanings.”).\n        Rather, it is clear from reading State Farm’s policy as a whole that the terms\n“Specified Causes of Loss” and “insured loss” have different meanings, and a specified\ncause of loss is not a covered loss under some circumstances. For example, the defined\nspecified causes of loss include the “weight of snow, ice or sleet” in paragraph 13, yet\nthe policy specifically excludes losses to “gutters and downspouts caused by weight of\n\f                                           15\n\ndischarge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the\n\nbreaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing\n\nwater or steam.” Amish Connection contends the drainpipe that burst is\n\na “system or appliance containing water.”              If so, the water damage to\n\nSuite 102 would fall within an exception to the separate exclusion for\n\n“rust, corrosion, [and] deterioration.” 3         But, standing alone, paragraph\n\n14 would not create coverage for rain damage because an exception to an\n\nexclusion does not create coverage that otherwise is lacking.                    As the\n\nIndiana Court of Appeals observed:\n\n              In general, “an exception to an exclusion cannot create\n       coverage where none exists. Exclusion clauses do not grant\n       or enlarge coverage; rather, they are limitations on the\n       insuring clause.” “In simplistic terms, the process is such: if\n       the insuring clause does not extend coverage, one need look\n       no further. If coverage exists, exclusions must then be\n       considered. If an exclusion excludes coverage, an exception\n       to the exclusion may re-grant coverage.”\n\n\n\n\n______________________\nsnow, sleet or ice” in limitation 9. Thus, merely because a matter is included within the\npolicy’s defined “Specified Causes of Loss” does not mean it cannot be subject to a\nseparate limitation or exclusion.\n       3State  Farm previously relied on that exclusion in addition to the rain limitation\nin denying the insurance claim. At oral argument, counsel for State Farm noted it was\nno longer relying on that exclusion found in the “LOSSES NOT INSURED” section of the\npolicy, which provides:\n                2.    We do not insure for loss either consisting of, or directly\n                      and immediately caused by, one or more of the following:\n                      ....\n                      d.     smog, wear, tear, rust, corrosion, fungus, mold,\n                             decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any\n                             quality in property that causes it to damage or\n                             destroy itself.\n                             But if accidental direct physical loss by any of the\n                             \"Specified Causes of Loss\" or by building glass\n                             breakage results, we will pay for that resulting loss\n                             ....\n\f                                        16\n\nHartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Evansville Vanderburgh, Pub. Library, 860\n\nN.E.2d 636, 646 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Amerisure Inc. v. Wurster\n\nConstr. Co., 818 N.E.2d 998, 1005 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted)).\n\n      Unlike the exclusion for rust or corrosion, the rain limitation\n\ncontains no exception for “Specified Causes of Loss.”            Yet, other\n\nprovisions in the “PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS” section of\n\nthe policy do include exceptions for “Specified Causes of Loss.”         For\n\nexample, on the same page, the policy provides:\n\n      We will not pay for loss: . . .\n\n      2.    to fragile articles, such as glassware, statuary . . . and\n            other articles of a brittle nature, if broken, unless\n            caused by any of the ‘Specified Causes of Loss’ or by\n            building glass breakage.\n\nIf the State Farm policy were intended to cover water damage from a\n\nbreaking gutter or drainpipe releasing rainwater, then the rain limitation\n\nin paragraph 6 likewise would have included an exception for specified\n\ncauses of loss such as a breaking pipe in a water system. See Oyens\n\nFeed & Supply, Inc. v. Primebank, 808 N.W.2d 186, 194 (Iowa 2011)\n\n(concluding that selective placement of phrase in one subsection but not\n\nanother meant the phrase did not apply where it was omitted). Coverage\n\nfor rainwater damage is lacking absent such an applicable exception\n\nwithin the rain limitation.\n\n      We assume for the sake of argument the interior drainpipe that\n\nfailed while carrying rainwater from the roof to the storm sewer may be\n\nconsidered “part of a system . . . containing water” within the meaning of\n\nparagraph 14. Cf. Cameron v. USAA Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 733 A.2d 965,\n\n971 (D.C. Ct. App. 1999) (applying surface-water exclusion to reject\n\ncoverage claim based on similar “water system” provision when gutter\n\nfailure during rainstorm contributed to water damage caused by\n\f                                    17\n\nrainwater flowing from patio). We also assume the water damage in this\n\ncase would not have occurred but for both the rainstorm and the failure\n\nof the interior drainpipe. That is, the breaking of the drainpipe was a\n\nconcurrent cause of the water damage to the office and its contents.\n\n      Nevertheless, paragraph 14 does not provide coverage because\n\nState Farm’s policy effectively has an anticoncurrent-cause provision.\n\nThis means the rain limitation controls regardless of whether the\n\nbreaking drainpipe is considered a concurrent cause of the rainwater\n\ndamage. The operative anticoncurrent-cause language turns on the word\n\n“or” in the lead paragraph of Section I of the policy, entitled “LOSSES\n\nINSURED AND LOSSES NOT INSURED”:\n\n      We insure for accidental direct physical loss to property\n      covered under this policy unless the loss is:\n            1.    limited in the PROPERTY           SUBJECT      TO\n                  LIMITATIONS section; or\n            2.    excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section\n                  that follows.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The district court quoted and relied on this provision\n\nin denying Amish Connection’s motion for a more specific ruling on\n\nsummary judgment.       The “or” in this provision is disjunctive.     See\n\nDenison Mun. Utils. v. Iowa Workers’ Comp. Comm’r, 857 N.W.2d 230,\n\n236 (Iowa 2014) (ascribing a disjunctive meaning to the word “or”\n\nbetween statutory provisions); Monroe County v. Int’l Ins. Co., 609 N.W.2d\n\n522, 525 (Iowa 2000) (holding disjunctive “or” between alternative\n\nprovisions of exclusion defeated coverage even though only one\n\nalternative applied). As the district court correctly concluded, this means\n\nthere is no coverage under the State Farm policy for property damage\n\nresulting under circumstances triggering either a limitation of loss in the\n\nfirst numbered paragraph or an exclusion in the second. That is, if the\n\f                                       18\n\nrain limitation applies, it does not matter whether this property loss\n\notherwise falls within the “water system break” exception to the rust\n\nexclusion.\n\n      This makes sense.         Water damage resulting from a breaking\n\nsprinkler or hot water pipe or radiator could be covered despite the rust-\n\nand-corrosion exclusion, but not water damage resulting from a breaking\n\ngutter or roof drainpipe for rainwater subject to the rain limitation. Why\n\nthe difference? Because the insurer expects the property owner to keep\n\nthe rain out and writes the policy to avoid paying for damage from rain\n\nresulting from deferred maintenance. See Petrick, 2010 WL 3257894, at\n\n*5 (applying rain limitation as intended to avoid insuring for damage\n\nresulting from deferred maintenance).           Under Amish Connection’s\n\ninterpretation, rain damage resulting from breaking gutters or drainpipes\n\nwould be covered, and the “or” in Section I would be replaced with the\n\nconjunctive “and” such that a loss is covered unless it is both within the\n\nrain limitation and (not “or”) excluded separately.      We will not rewrite\n\nclear policy language.   See Boelman, 826 N.W.2d at 502. Rather, “we\n\nmust enforce unambiguous exclusions as written.”              Bituminous Cas.\n\nCorp., 728 N.W.2d at 222.\n\n      The anticoncurrent-cause language in State Farm’s policy is\n\nenforceable. See, e.g., TNT Speed & Sport Ctr., Inc. v. Am. States Ins. Co.,\n\n114 F.3d 731, 733 (8th Cir. 1997) (enforcing anticoncurrent-cause\n\nprovision    under   Missouri   law,   noting   “the   most   analogous   and\n\npersuasive cases from other states recognize that parties may contract\n\nout of application of the efficient proximate cause doctrine”); see\n\ngenerally Dale Joseph Gilsinger, Validity, Construction, and Application of\n\nAnticoncurrent Causation (ACC) Clauses in Insurance Policies, 37\n\nA.L.R.6th 657 (2008 & Supp. 2014).          Some insurance policies include\n\f                                          19\n\nmore expansive anticoncurrent-cause provisions than State Farm’s\n\npolicy.    See id. at 669–70 (quoting standard long-form and short-form\n\nprovisions).    The fact an insurer could have made an exclusion more\n\nexplicit does not make the existing language ambiguous.                   See In re\n\nKatrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 209–10 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n(enforcing flood exclusions for water damage allegedly resulting from the\n\nnegligent design, construction, or maintenance of flood-protection levies);\n\nCorrigan, 697 N.W.2d at 114. Indeed, in Corrigan, we specifically held\n\nthe omission of an anticoncurrent-cause provision in the liability section\n\nof the homeowners’ policy did not create ambiguity even though such a\n\nprovision was included in the property insurance section of the same\n\npolicy.     697 N.W.2d at 114–15.         Thus, as the district court correctly\n\nconcluded, because the rain limitation applies, there is no coverage\n\nregardless of whether the breaking drainpipe falls within the exception to\n\nthe separate rust-and-corrosion exclusion.\n\n       When insurance policies lack such an anticoncurrent-cause\n\nprovision, we have held an accident that has two independent causes,\n\none of which is covered and one excluded, is covered unless the excluded\n\ncause is the sole proximate cause of injury. See, e.g., Grinnell Mut. Reins.\n\nCo. v. Emp’rs Mut. Cas. Co., 494 N.W. 2d 690, 693–94 (Iowa 1993)\n\n(holding general liability insurer covered personal injury claim arising\n\nfrom      student’s   fall   from   bus   because   school   district’s   negligent\n\nsupervision of loading fell outside scope of motor vehicle exclusion);\n\nKalell v. Mut. Fire & Auto. Ins. Co., 471 N.W.2d 865, 868 (Iowa 1991) (“We\n\nhold that, when two independent acts of negligence are alleged, one\n\nvehicle-related and one not vehicle-related, coverage is still provided\n\nunder the homeowners policy unless the vehicle-related negligence is the\n\nsole proximate cause of the injury. Under Iowa law, of course, more than\n\f                                        20\n\none proximate cause may exist.”).            In Kalell, the homeowners policy\n\nexcluded coverage for bodily injury arising out of use of a motor vehicle\n\nowned by the insured. Id. at 866. The victim was injured when struck\n\nby a tree limb the insured was pulling off a tree with a rope attached to\n\nhis pickup truck. Id. We noted coverage clearly would be outside the\n\nscope of the exclusion if people had pulled on the ropes manually\n\nwithout using the vehicle. Id. at 868. We concluded pulling the limb\n\nwith a rope and use of the truck were independent acts and held the trier\n\nof fact must determine whether use of the motor vehicle was the sole\n\nproximate cause of the injury.         Id. at 869.   These cases do not help\n\nAmish Connection because neither case involved an anticoncurrent-\n\ncause provision and paragraph 14 is not an independent coverage grant,\n\nbut rather merely removes breaking pipes from the rust-and-corrosion\n\nexclusion.\n\n      More recently, in Corrigan, parents of a child injured in day care\n\nsued the day-care providers, who sought liability coverage under their\n\nhomeowners policy.       697 N.W.2d at 109–110.            The policy excluded\n\ncoverage for “bodily injury . . . arising out of . . . violation of any criminal\n\nlaw for which any insured is convicted.” Id. at 110. One insured was\n\nconvicted of child endangerment. Id. at 109–10. Another was sued for\n\nnegligent supervision. Id. at 110. We held the insurer was entitled to\n\nsummary      judgment    based    on     the    criminal   act   exclusion   and\n\ndistinguished Kalell, noting that the covered and excluded acts were not\n\n“independent” because to prove negligent supervision, one had to prove\n\nthe underlying tort by the person who was not properly supervised. Id.\n\nat 112–13.     That is, there would have been no injury without the\n\nexcluded criminal act. See id. Similarly, there would have been no water\n\ndamage here but for the rainfall, and damage caused by this rain is not\n\f                                    21\n\ncovered. This case is more like Corrigan than Kalell. In any event, we\n\nresolve the coverage claims based on the unambiguous contract\n\nlanguage, not tort causation principles.\n\n      Amish Connection relies heavily on a New York trial court decision,\n\nWider v. Heritage Maintenance, Inc., 827 N.Y.S.2d 837 (Sup. Ct. 2007).\n\nIn that case, a third-party contractor working on the façade of the\n\ninsured’s building negligently placed tarps on scaffolding next to the\n\nbuilding that collected rainwater. Id. at 842. The tarps were not placed\n\non the scaffolding to keep rain out of the building, and “in the tarps’\n\nabsence, the rain would have merely fallen on the ground.” Id. at 845.\n\nThe tarps were attached to ornaments on the façade that broke off from\n\nthe weight of the pooled water, which then seeped in to damage the\n\ninterior of the building. Id. at 842. The insurer failed to show that the\n\ntarps collapsed during a rainfall.         Id. at 844.   The trial court\n\nacknowledged “it is clear that the Policy was not intended to cover\n\ndamage to the interior of the Building stemming from rain.” Id. at 845.\n\nThe trial court distinguished water damage from rain that directly enters\n\na building during a rainstorm from damage resulting from pooled\n\n“surface water” that had collected in the tarps.    Id. at 844.   The trial\n\ncourt denied the insurer’s motion for summary judgment on the rain\n\nlimitation, stating:\n\n      The ordinary business person purchasing the Policy at issue\n      here would not have expected the Rain Limitation to apply to\n      an incident in which a temporary, man-made structure\n      collected rainwater, diverting it from the ground and into the\n      policyholder’s Building.     Therefore, the Rain Limitation\n      cannot be used to disclaim covered for damage and losses\n      stemming from the September Incident.\n\nId. at 845.     Wider is distinguishable from this case in which the\n\ndrainpipe, installed to carry rainwater falling on the roof to the storm\n\f                                    22\n\nsewer, failed and spilled rainwater as it flowed down during the\n\nrainstorm.     Nor are we persuaded by Tento International, Inc. v. State\n\nFarm Fire & Casualty Co., which held a contractor’s negligent failure to\n\ntemporarily cover a hole it opened in the insured’s roof, rather than rain,\n\nwas the efficient proximate cause of water damage to electrical\n\nequipment within the building. 222 F.3d 660, 662–63 (9th Cir. 2000)\n\n(applying California law).    The appellate court construed a separate\n\nprovision of the policy to allow coverage for property damage caused by\n\nthe negligence of a third-party contractor. Id. at 663. By contrast, the\n\nrain limitation in State Farm’s policy contains no applicable exception for\n\nthe negligence of a third party.         In any event, Wider and Tento\n\nInternational are trumped by our decision in Corrigan, which we decline\n\nto overrule.\n\n      We hold that under the unambiguous terms of State Farm’s policy,\n\ndamage from rainwater released by a breaking drainpipe during a\n\nrainstorm is not an insured loss because the damage is caused by rain\n\nwithin the meaning of the rain limitation, even though the breaking\n\ndrainpipe is a concurrent cause.\n\n      IV. Disposition.\n\n      For those reasons, the district court correctly granted State Farm’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment based on the rain limitation. We therefore\n\nvacate the decision of the court of appeals and affirm the summary\n\njudgment entered by the district court.\n\n      DECISION OF COURT OF APPEALS VACATED; DISTRICT\n\nCOURT SUMMARY JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\n      All justices concur except Hecht, Wiggins, and Appel, JJ., who\n\ndissent.\n\f                                     23\n                                 #13–0124, Amish Connection v.

While I agree with my colleagues in the\n\nmajority that the policy exclusion for losses “caused by rain” is an\n\nimportant aspect of a proper analysis of this case, I disagree that our\n\ndisposition turns on the perceived distinction between rain and\n\nrainwater.\n\n      It is important to understand precisely the loss for which Amish\n\nConnection seeks coverage. Amish Connection does not claim coverage\n\nfor the cost of repairing or replacing the failed drain pipe. Cf. Berry v.\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 87 F.3d 387, 388 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting the\n\ndamage for which coverage was sought was a damaged irrigation pipe);\n\nArkwright-Boston Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wausau Paper Mills Co., 818 F.2d\n\n591, 593–95 (7th Cir. 1987) (affirming summary judgment granted to the\n\ninsurer based on a corrosion exclusion when the only damage was the\n\ncost of repairing a corroded reactor used to extract papermaking\n\nchemicals). Rather, the loss was water damage to Amish Connection’s\n\ninventory, furnishings, equipment, and documents after the pipe burst.\n\n      Water damage is among the “Specified Causes of Loss” covered by\n\nthe policy.   The policy definition of “water damage” expressly includes\n\n“accidental discharge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of\n\nthe breaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing\n\nwater or steam.”    Thus, the casualty Amish Connection suffered is a\n\ncovered loss unless it falls within one of the narrowly construed\n\nlimitations or exclusions.      See Farm & City Ins. Co. v. Gilmore, 539\n\nN.W.2d 154, 157 (Iowa 1995) (“Insurance policy exclusions are strictly\n\nconstrued against the insurer.”); see also Essex Ins. Co. v. Fieldhouse,\n\nInc., 506 N.W.2d 772, 776 (Iowa 1993) (“[W]hen an exclusion acts to\n\f                                     24\n\nwithdraw a promised coverage, it must be clearly and explicitly defined.”);\n\nGrinnell Mut. Reins. Co. v. Emp’rs Mut. Cas. Co., 494 N.W.2d 690, 693\n\n(Iowa 1993) (noting exclusionary clauses “require a narrow or restrictive\n\nconstruction”); Kalell v. Mut. Fire & Auto. Ins. Co., 471 N.W.2d 865, 867\n\n(Iowa 1991) (“[I]nsurance policies are adhesion contracts, and exclusions\n\nwill be strictly construed against the insurer.”).\n\n      My colleagues in the majority conclude as a matter of law the\n\npolicy provides no coverage for Amish Connection’s loss because it was\n\ncaused by rainwater. Because I believe a genuine issue of material fact\n\nremains on the question whether the loss was in fact caused by rain or,\n\ninstead, by some other covered occurrence (or a combination of covered\n\nand uncovered occurrences), summary judgment is inappropriate and\n\nthe case should proceed to trial.\n\n      “Causation has always been a troublesome concept for lawyers.”\n\nBanks McDowell, Causation in Contracts and Insurance, 20 Conn. L. Rev.\n\n569, 569 (1988) [hereinafter McDowell].       Particularly troublesome are\n\ninstances of “dual or concurrent causation—where two or more\n\noccurrences lead to a loss and at least one is covered under the terms of\n\na single insurance policy.” Id. at 570 (footnotes omitted). In my view,\n\nthis case presents one such instance. Amish Connection suffered a loss\n\nwhen a pipe burst during a heavy rainstorm. State Farm asserts the loss\n\nwas “caused by rain” because the pipe would not have failed without the\n\nvolume of water the storm produced. Yet, the summary judgment record\n\nin this case leaves room for a reasonable fact finder to find the loss\n\nAmish Connection suffered would not have occurred as a consequence of\n\nthe rain alone, but only because the pipe failed while the rainwater was\n\npassing through it. In other words, a fact question remains whether the\n\nloss might not have occurred but for the confluence of at least two\n\f                                      25\n\ncauses. See Randall L. Smith & Fred A. Simpson, Causation in Insurance\n\nLaw, 48 S. Tex. L. Rev. 305, 312 (2006) (“Perils A and B, independent of\n\neach other, join in causing the loss, both perils being necessary to cause\n\nthe loss since neither peril alone is sufficient to do so.”).\n\n      “While the notion of causation is simple, the factual world to which\n\nit must be applied is not.”         McDowell, 20 Conn. L. Rev. at 573.\n\nComplexity arises “in situations of concurrent causation because one\n\ncause of the loss may be covered by an insurance policy and another\n\ncause either not covered or specifically excluded from coverage.” Erik S.\n\nKnutsen,    Confusion    About    Causation    in   Insurance:   Solutions   for\n\nCatastrophic Losses, 61 Ala. L. Rev. 957, 962 (2010) [hereinafter\n\nKnutsen]. This case presents a causation and coverage quandary: Water\n\ndamage caused by accidental leakage is a “Specified Cause of Loss”\n\nunder the policy, but losses “caused by rain” are excluded.\n\n      In concurrent causation scenarios, some jurisdictions utilize a\n\n“liberal approach” to coverage under which an entire loss is covered as\n\nlong as it was caused in part by a covered occurrence. See id. at 976 &\n\nn.56 (listing the “minority of states” that follow this rule).     Under this\n\napproach, if two events combine to cause the loss—one covered and one\n\nexcluded—coverage exists even though the excluded event was a cause.\n\nWhile this rule “is not perfect,” it “promulgates a fairer result in\n\ninstances where two . . . concurrent causes produce the loss and neither\n\non its own is sufficient to cause some harm.”            Id. at 984; see also\n\nBrendan R. Vaughan, Note, Watered Down: Are Insurance Companies\n\nGetting Hosed in the Wind vs. Water Controversy?, 2008 U. Ill. L. Rev.\n\n777, 796 (2008) (acknowledging a benefit of the liberal approach is its\n\n“ease of use in situations where it is difficult to segregate independent\n\ncauses to determine which one is . . . dominant”).\n\f                                     26\n\n      Another approach is the “efficient proximate cause” test under\n\nwhich the fact finder evaluates competing concurrent but-for causes to\n\ndetermine which was the primary cause of the loss.         See Knutsen, 61\n\nAla. L. Rev. at 974–75 (explaining this approach). This test does require\n\na decision about which of two competing causes was dominant.             See\n\nTento Int’l, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 222 F.3d 660, 662 (9th Cir.\n\n2000) (“While the rain may have been the most immediate cause of [the]\n\ndamages, the more important inquiry involves determining . . . the\n\nefficient proximate cause of the damage.”).      In this case, the “efficient\n\nproximate cause” test would require the fact finder to determine whether\n\nthe magnitude of the rain event or the condition or capacity of the\n\ndrainpipe was the primary cause of the pipe failure and Amish\n\nConnection’s loss.\n\n      Finally, the “conservative approach” is a third analytical option.\n\nUnder this approach, “if one cause in a causal chain is excluded from\n\ninsurance coverage, the entire loss must be excluded from coverage, even\n\nif other causes may be covered by the policy.” Knutsen, 61 Ala. L. Rev.\n\nat 972.\n\n      Although we have not consistently applied any of these tests in\n\nIowa, we have followed principles from both the liberal approach and the\n\nefficient proximate cause approach.       See Grinnell Mut. Reins. Co., 494\n\nN.W.2d at 691, 694 (concluding an insurer’s exclusion of coverage for\n\nbodily injury “arising out of the ownership, . . . operation, use, loading or\n\nunloading of any automobile” did not preclude coverage for an injury\n\nsustained by a student while exiting a school bus because the school’s\n\nalleged “negligent supervision leading to negligent loading of the bus was\n\nnot vehicle-related and was, or could have been determined to be, a\n\nproximate cause”); Kalell, 471 N.W.2d at 868 (“We hold that, when two\n\f                                     27\n\nindependent acts are alleged, one vehicle-related and one not vehicle-\n\nrelated, coverage is still provided under the homeowners policy unless\n\nthe vehicle-related negligence [that was excluded from coverage] is the\n\nsole proximate cause of the injury.”); Jordan v. Iowa Mut. Tornado Ins.\n\nCo. of Des Moines, 151 Iowa 73, 84, 130 N.W. 177, 181 (1911) (using the\n\nphrase “efficient cause” and noting the proposition “[t]hat other . . .\n\ncauses may also have contributed to the loss does not, of itself, relieve\n\nthe [insurer] from responsibility”); Bettis v.

App. 1989) (“[W]e look not necessarily to\n\nthe last act in the chain of events, but rather to the predominant cause\n\nwhich set in motion the chain of events causing the loss.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.)).\n\n      My research reveals no instance in which we have applied the\n\napproach styled as the “conservative approach.” This should not come\n\nas a surprise given our adoption of principles protecting insureds’\n\ninterests in litigation against their insurers. See Grinnell Mut. Reins. Co.,\n\n494 N.W.2d at 693 (“Coverage clauses are construed differently than\n\nexclusionary clauses. When construing coverage clauses, the words . . .\n\nare given a broad, general and comprehensive meaning.          Exclusionary\n\nclauses, however, require a narrow or restrictive construction.” (Citation\n\nomitted.)); Kalell, 471 N.W.2d at 867 (“If an insurance policy is\n\nambiguous, we construe it in the light most favorable to the insured;\n\ninsurance policies are adhesion contracts, and exclusions will be strictly\n\nconstrued against the insurer.”); N. Star Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holty, 402\n\nN.W.2d 452, 454 (Iowa 1987) (“Where the meaning of terms in an\n\ninsurance policy is susceptible to two interpretations, the one favoring\n\nthe insured is adopted.”).\n\f                                     28\n\n       In my view, this is a case involving concurrent causes of a loss.\n\nThere is evidence in this record tending to prove the rain event was not\n\nthe singular cause of Amish Connection’s loss. The summary judgment\n\nrecord leaves room for the possibility that a fact finder could determine\n\nAmish Connection’s loss would not have occurred but for the pipe’s\n\nweakened condition and its failure.       When faced with multiple-cause\n\nscenarios like this, some courts—including our own—have found\n\ncoverage as a matter of law when one of the causal factors was covered\n\nby an insurance policy.      Kinney v. Farmers’ Mut. Fire & Ins.

A major insurance law treatise succinctly\n\ndescribes the strong preference for a jury to resolve causation questions:\n\n             Issues of causation are almost always questions of\n      fact. Determining what perils were working and whether\n      they were working together independently or in succession\n      (and if so how), as well as identifying the type of damage\n      following the operation of each peril, all fall to the fact finder.\n\n5 New Appleman on Insurance Law § 44.06[1], at 44-45 (Jeffrey E.\n\nThomas & Susan Randall eds., Library ed. 2014). A case decided by the\n\f                                    30\n\nWashington Court of Appeals presents an apt illustration of this maxim.\n\nSunbreaker Condo. Ass’n v. Travelers Ins. Co., 901 P.2d 1079, 1085\n\n(Wash. Ct. App. 1995). In the case, four possible causes of a loss were\n\nindicated. See id. at 1081. One of the potential causes of the loss was\n\ncovered and three were excluded.      See id. (noting damage from wind-\n\ndriven rain was covered, but damage from dry rot, seepage, or defective\n\nconstruction was not).     The court declined to resolve the coverage\n\nquestion as a matter of law because causation “is an issue of material\n\nfact precluding summary judgment.” Id. at 1085. The same principle\n\nshould be applied here.\n\n      Caselaw from other jurisdictions supports my view that summary\n\njudgment should not have been granted in this case.

Together, these cases—\n\nboth those that involved summary judgment and those in which a fact\n\nfinder decided causation—demonstrate that concurrent causation issues\n\noften present factual questions only a fact finder should answer.\n\n      I acknowledge that some courts have granted summary judgment\n\nto the insurer in concurrent causation circumstances.

App. 2009) (affirming summary\n\njudgment granted to State Farm because of express policy language that\n\nexcluded coverage for third-party negligence if it interacted in any way\n\nwith an otherwise-excluded cause). The effect, if any, of anticoncurrent-\n\ncause language was not raised or decided in the district court and is not\n\nbefore us in this appeal.\n\n        The majority characterizes the “LOSSES INSURED” section of\n\nAmish Connection’s policy as a functional equivalent of anticoncurrent-\n\ncause language. The LOSSES INSURED section of the policy states, in\n\nits entirety:\n\n        We insure for accidental direct physical loss to property\n        covered under this policy unless the loss is:\n\n                1.   limited in the PROPERTY       SUBJECT     TO\n                     LIMITATIONS section; or\n\n                2.   excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section\n                     that follows.\n\nIn my view, however, this is not an anticoncurrent-cause provision.\n\nCases cited by the majority in this case illustrate the fact that\n\f                                       35\n\nanticoncurrent-cause      provisions        typically    include   the    word\n\n“concurrent”—for example: “We will not pay for loss or damage caused\n\ndirectly or indirectly by any of the following.         Such loss or damage is\n\nexcluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes\n\nconcurrently or in any sequence to the loss.” TNT Speed & Sport Ctr.,\n\n114 F.3d at 732 (quoting an anticoncurrent-cause policy provision); see\n\nalso Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Corrigan, 697 N.W.2d 108, 114–15 (Iowa\n\n2005) (enforcing an anticoncurrent-cause provision).\n\n      Amish Connection’s policy does include express anticoncurrent-\n\ncause provisions like those involved in TNT Speed and Corrigan.            For\n\nexample, paragraph 1 of the “LOSSES NOT INSURED” section reads:\n\n      1.    We do not insure under any coverage for any loss\n            which would not have occurred in the absence of one\n            or more of the following excluded events. We do not\n            insure for such loss regardless of: (a) the cause of the\n            excluded event; or (b) other causes of the loss; or (c)\n            whether other causes acted concurrently or in any\n            sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss[.]\n\nThe “following excluded events” to which this provision refers are:\n\nenforcement of any ordinance or law; earth movement; volcanic eruption;\n\nwater such as flood, surface water, waves, tides, mudslides, sewer\nbackup, and seeping groundwater; seizure or destruction of property by\n\norder of governmental authority; nuclear hazard; failure of power to the\n\npremises; and war or military action.\n\n      Paragraph 3 of the LOSSES NOT INSURED section contains\n\nadditional anticoncurrent-cause language:\n\n      We do not insure for any coverage for any loss consisting of\n      one or more of the items below. Further, we do not insure\n      for loss described in paragraphs 1. or 2. immediately above\n      regardless of whether one or more of the following: (a)\n      directly or indirectly cause, contribute to or aggravate the\n      loss; or (b) occur before, at the same time, or after the loss or\n      any other cause of the loss[.]\n\f                                   36\n\nState Farm did not raise either of these provisions in its motion for\n\nsummary judgment.      Nor did it raise them in its resistance to Amish\n\nConnection’s motion for more specific ruling. Instead, State Farm relied\n\nexclusively on language from a different section: the LOSSES INSURED\n\nsection. Notably, State Farm expressly argued the district court need not\n\nconsider any language from the LOSSES NOT INSURED section.           The\n\ndistrict court agreed, and even when it denied Amish Connection’s\n\nmotion for a more specific ruling, the court expressly relied only on the\n\nLOSSES INSURED section of the policy.\n\n      The majority concludes State Farm’s reliance on the LOSSES\n\nINSURED policy provision effectively raised any anticoncurrent-cause\n\nprovisions in the policy. I strongly disagree. Both anticoncurrent-cause\n\nprovisions are in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section—and State Farm\n\nexpressly asserted the district court should not even consider language\n\nfrom that section in making its summary judgment decision.\n\n      I acknowledge the maxim that “[t]he individual provisions of a\n\npolicy must be read in conjunction with the policy as a whole.” Ferguson\n\nv. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 512 N.W.2d 296, 300 (Iowa 1994); accord Grinnell\n\nMut. Reinsurance Co., 494 N.W.2d at 692.      But this maxim does not\n\nauthorize State Farm to sing a completely different song on appeal than\n\nit sang in the district court. See State v. Rutledge, 600 N.W.2d 324, 325\n\n(Iowa 1999). Further, even if we were to consider policy provisions—the\n\nLOSSES NOT INSURED section—not relied upon by State Farm in the\n\ndistrict court or the court itself in its summary judgment ruling, we\n\nshould not find them sufficient to decide the coverage question in this\n\ncase as a matter of law.\n\n      Amish Connection is not covered if its loss was “caused by rain,”\n\nas stated in the PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS section, or if it\n\f                                    37\n\nis excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section. I acknowledge that\n\nthe word “or” is disjunctive in this context. But whether the loss was\n\n“caused by rain”—or by some other covered cause—is the fighting issue\n\nin this case.   In my view, provisions in the LOSSES NOT INSURED\n\nsection leave wide open the possibility that causes of loss other than rain\n\nare not excluded—even when concurrent causes are involved—and are\n\ntherefore still in play here. A jury should be entitled to resolve factual\n\nquestions like these.\n\n      I begin with paragraph 1 of the LOSSES NOT INSURED section.\n\nParagraph 1 excludes any loss concurrently caused, even in part, by\n\noccurrences from a list of “excluded events.”          These events are\n\npredominantly large-scale disasters—earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,\n\nnuclear meltdowns.      Paragraph 1(d) includes “surface water” as an\n\nexcluded event.   However, because surface water is included in a list\n\nalongside flood, waves, tides, mudslides, and groundwater seepage, it is\n\nevident—using the canon of noscitur a sociis—that surface water in\n\nparagraph 1(d) does not include the rainfall in this case.     See Black’s\n\nLaw Dictionary 1224 (10th ed. 2014) (explaining that noscitur a sociis\n\nmeans the definition of a word or phrase “should be determined by the\n\nwords immediately surrounding it”). None of the other “excluded events”\n\nin paragraph 1 are remotely applicable to this case.          Accordingly,\n\nparagraph 1 does not preclude the possibility that, if Amish Connection’s\n\nloss had multiple causes—one excluded and one covered—a jury could\n\nfind the covered hazard was predominant and should afford Amish\n\nConnection coverage in this case.\n\n      I now turn to paragraph 3.     This paragraph’s language must be\n\nunpacked carefully. The first sentence states: “We do not insure for any\n\ncoverage for any loss consisting of one or more of the items below.”\n\f                                    38\n\n(Emphasis added.). The “items below” are subparts 3(a) and 3(b). 3(a)\n\nrefers to “conduct, acts or decisions, including the failure to act or\n\ndecide, of any person . . . , whether intentional, wrongful, negligent or\n\nwithout fault”—essentially third-party negligence. 3(b) refers to “faulty,\n\ninadequate, unsound or defective” planning, design, construction,\n\nmaterials, and maintenance.         But, as I have explained, Amish\n\nConnection’s loss does not consist of third-party negligence or faulty\n\nmaintenance; if it did, the only costs for which Amish Connection would\n\nbe seeking coverage would be the cost of repairing or replacing the failed\n\npipe. Therefore, this first sentence of paragraph 3, standing alone, would\n\nnot preclude coverage for a loss “caused by”—not “consisting of”—faulty\n\nmaintenance.\n\n      The next sentence of paragraph 3 provides:\n\n      [W]e do not insure for loss described in paragraphs 1. and 2.\n      immediately above regardless of whether [the causes\n      described in 3(a) and 3(b)]: (a) directly or indirectly cause,\n      contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the\n      same time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss[.]\n\nAs I have explained, paragraph 1 immediately above this language\n\ncontains “excluded events” that are all inapplicable to the factual\n\ncircumstances of this case. Paragraph 2 “immediately above” describes\n\nsixteen types of loss, in subparts 2(a) through 2(p). Only two of these\n\ncould possibly be relevant here.     Paragraph 2(k)—in conjunction with\n\nparagraph 3—excludes coverage for loss caused by “continuous or\n\nrepeated seepage or leakage of water that occurs over a period of time”\n\nwhen that seepage combines with third-party negligence or faulty\n\nmaintenance.    However, the loss (water-soaked and ruined inventory)\n\nclaimed in this case by Amish Connection was not due to continued or\n\f                                    39\n\nrepeated seepage or leakage; it was due to a one-time event—the burst\n\npipe.\n\n        Paragraph 2(d) is the only other subpart of paragraph 2 that could\n\npossibly be relevant here.      It excludes loss caused by—not merely\n\nconsisting of—rust, corrosion, and deterioration.          Combined with\n\nparagraph 3, paragraph 2(d) could, at first blush, reasonably be read to\n\nexclude coverage if faulty maintenance caused the pipe to rust, which in\n\nturn caused the water damage in this case.       However, paragraph 2(d)\n\ncontains an additional statement: “But if accidental direct physical loss\n\nby any of the ‘Specified Causes of Loss’ . . . results, we will pay for that\n\nresulting loss[.]” (Emphasis added.). In other words, although most loss\n\ncaused by rust, corrosion, or deterioration is excluded, “Specified Causes\n\nof Loss” are still covered. As I have noted above, the Specified Causes of\n\nLoss under this policy include “water damage” arising from “accidental\n\ndischarge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the\n\nbreaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing\n\nwater or steam.” Thus, even if there is evidence that faulty maintenance\n\nof the pipe allowed it to rust and ultimately fail, Amish Connection’s loss\n\nis not excluded from coverage under paragraph 3(b).\n\n        My colleagues in the majority stress the fact that, according to\n\nState Farm, the policy was never intended to cover faulty maintenance.\n\nWhatever State Farm’s intent, however, the actual policy language belies\n\nthat assumption.      The final clause of paragraph 3 states: “But if\n\naccidental direct physical loss results from items 3.a. and 3.b., we will\n\npay for that resulting loss unless the resulting loss is itself one of the\n\nlosses not insured in this section.”     Item 3(b) is faulty maintenance.\n\nThus, this express policy language indicates State Farm will pay for loss\n\nresulting from faulty maintenance unless the resulting loss is not\n\f                                     40\n\ninsured in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section.              Crucially, the rain\n\nlimitation is not found in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section. In sum,\n\neven if State Farm and the district court had relied on the LOSSES NOT\n\nINSURED section of the policy—and here they clearly didn’t—summary\n\njudgment would not have been appropriate in this case.\n\n      Although the majority attempts to distinguish it, the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s decision in Tento International is actually quite analogous to this\n\ncase. See Tento Int’l, 222 F.3d at 661. A roofing contractor was making\n\nrepairs but failed to install a temporary covering.           Id.   “Almost\n\npredictably, rain fell and damaged Tento’s electronics equipment.”        Id.\n\nTento’s insurance policy with State Farm contained a rain limitation\n\nidentical to the one in Amish Connection’s policy, and it also contained\n\nan identical paragraph 3. See id. at 661–62. The court determined the\n\nefficient cause, not merely the most immediate cause, should determine\n\ncoverage—even though the policy had several provisions materially\n\nidentical to the ones in Amish Connection’s policy. See id. at 662.\n\n      Further, the court examined the “inexact wording in the resulting-\n\nloss provision.” Id. It determined Tento had coverage as a matter of law:\n\n             The resulting-loss provision states that, “if accidental\n      direct physical loss results from items 3.a. and 3.b. [i.e., the\n      contractor’s third-party negligence], we will pay for that\n      resulting loss unless the resulting loss is itself one of the\n      losses not insured in this section.” (emphasis added). The\n      question becomes whether the resulting loss—damage to\n      Tento’s goods by rain—is “one of the losses not insured in\n      this section.” (emphasis added). The words “in this section\n      appear in numbered paragraph 3 of the LOSSES NOT\n      INSURED section of the policy. Logically, then, the words “in\n      this section” refer to the LOSSES NOT INSURED section and\n      that section does not preclude coverage for rain damage.\n\n            We recognize it is arguable that the scope of the “in\n      this section” phrase could refer to the entire basic coverage\n      of Section I, which includes the LOSSES INSURED as well as\n      the LOSSES NOT INSURED sections.               The LOSSES\n\f                                    41\n      INSURED section incorporates by reference the earlier\n      PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS section, and that\n      section includes the rain-damage limitation. Under this\n      reading, the policy would not provide coverage for Tento’s\n      rain-damaged goods.         We reject this reading, however,\n      because it is illogical, and defies a common-sense reading of\n      the policy. Moreover, we note that when the policy refers to\n      the entire “Section I,” it uses an upper case “S” to signal this\n      broader reference.\n\nId. at 663. Amish Connection’s policy also uses an uppercase S when\nreferring to the entire Section I. Applying the Tento analysis to the facts\nof this case, Amish Connection might have coverage as a matter of law—\nalthough its loss might fit more squarely under the paragraph 3(b) faulty\nmaintenance provision than under the paragraph 3(a) third-party\nnegligence provision.\n      But I do not advocate we go that far on this record.        Rather, I\nconclude the summary judgment should be reversed and the case\nremanded for trial.      The evidence will establish whether Amish\nConnection’s loss was due to the mall’s faulty maintenance, or rust,\ndecay, or some other cause or combination of causes. Although coverage\nis excluded if the loss was caused by rain, it could also have been caused\nby something else, or by a combination of other causes for which\ncoverage exists.\n      When reviewing summary judgment rulings, we must make all\nfactual inferences supported by the record in the nonmovant’s favor.\nSee, e.g., Hagenow v. Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., 846 N.W.2d 373, 376 (Iowa\n2014); Pitts v. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 818 N.W.2d 91, 96 (Iowa 2012);\nEmp’rs Mut. Cas. Co. v. Van Haaften, 815 N.W.2d 17, 22 (Iowa 2012). In\nthis case, I believe a reasonable fact finder could find rain was neither\nthe sole nor even the primary factual cause of Amish Connection’s loss. I\nwould therefore affirm the court of appeals and afford Amish Connection\nthe opportunity to make its case on the causation question.\n      Wiggins and Appel, JJ., join this dissent.\n\f",

Thomas of Grefe & Sidney, P.L.C., Des Moines, for\n\nappellee.\n\f                                     2\n\nWATERMAN, Justice.\n\n      In this appeal, we must decide whether a business insurance\n\npolicy covers water damage inside a building resulting when a corroded\n\ninterior drainpipe bursts during a summer rainstorm. The pipe carried\n\nrainwater from the roof to a storm sewer.         The policy only insures\n\ndamage “caused by rain” if an insured event first ruptures the roof or\n\nexterior walls to allow the rain to enter or if the damage results from\n\nmelting ice or snow. The district court granted summary judgment for\n\nthe insurer, concluding the water damage was caused by rain. The court\n\nof appeals reversed, concluding that damage from “rainwater” flowing\n\nfrom the broken interior drainpipe is not damage “caused by rain.” We\n\ngranted the insurer’s application for further review.\n\n      This case presents our first opportunity to adjudicate coverage\n\nclaims under a rain limitation in an insurance policy. For the reasons\n\nexplained below, we conclude the unambiguous language of the rain\n\nlimitation precludes coverage for the damage caused by the rainwater\n\nescaping the ruptured interior drainpipe. We, like the district court, also\n\nreject the insured’s alternative argument that coverage is available\n\nbecause the damage resulted from the “breaking or cracking of any part\n\nof a system containing water or steam.” That argument fails because the\n\npolicy does not provide coverage for damage “caused by rain,” even if a\n\nsystem containing water was involved. We therefore vacate the decision\n\nof the court of appeals and affirm the district court’s summary judgment\n\nin favor of the insurer.\n\n      I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      Amish Connection, Inc. leased space in Crossroads Shopping Mall\n\nin Waterloo, where it operated the Amish Connection Store.       In 2008,\n\nAmish Connection moved into Suite 102. This litigation arises from the\n\f                                    3\n\nfailure of a leaky four-inch cast-iron drainpipe that ran above the ceiling\n\ntiles and along the interior back wall. This pipe connected to the rooftop\n\ndrains and carried rainwater down and through the interior of the\n\nbuilding to a storm sewer.       During heavy rains, leaking rainwater\n\nroutinely ran down the back wall of the suite. To address the leakage,\n\nmall management installed a makeshift wooden trough to catch the\n\nrainwater from the back wall and direct it toward a drain. The drainage\n\ntile and pipe system in Suite 102 showed “trails of rust left by years of\n\nwater leak issues.” The drainpipe was hidden from the tenant’s view by\n\nceiling tiles and wallboard, and Amish Connection was unaware that it\n\nleaked.   The drainpipe itself was “extremely rusty” before it failed.\n\nSubsequent photos show extensive corrosion on the pipe, especially\n\nwhere it joined the wall.\n\n      In May 2010, the owner of Amish Connection approached the mall\n\nmanager about closing the store until November “because business was\n\nbad.” New lease contracts were prepared to allow Amish Connection to\n\nclose its business to the public through October and reopen November 1.\n\nDuring that period, Amish Connection would continue paying rent for\n\nSuite 102 and store property there.        On June 14, the new lease\n\nagreements were executed. It rained heavily that night. The rainstorm\n\ncaused no damage to the roof, windows, or exterior walls of the building.\n\nThe next morning, however, the mall maintenance staff discovered the\n\ninterior drainpipe had failed, flooding the back room of Suite 102 with up\n\nto several inches of rainwater and soaking the carpet in much of the\n\nfront showroom.     The rainwater caused substantial damage to Amish\n\nConnection’s office, bathroom, and property stored there, including its\n\nsamples, inventory, office supplies, and business records.\n\f                                      4\n\n      Amish Connection promptly submitted a claim under its business\n\ninsurance policy with State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State\n\nFarm). Section I of the policy, entitled “LOSSES INSURED AND LOSSES\n\nNOT INSURED,” provides:\n\n      We insure for accidental direct physical loss to property\n      covered under this policy unless the loss is:\n             1.     limited in the PROPERTY            SUBJECT    TO\n                    LIMITATIONS section; or\n             2.     excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section\n                    that follows.\n\nThe relevant provisions of those two sections state:\n\n      PROPERTY SUBJECT\n      TO LIMITATIONS\n      We will not pay for loss:\n             ....\n             6.     to the interior of any building or structure, or\n                    the property inside any building or structure,\n                    caused by rain, snow, sleet, ice, sand, or dust,\n                    whether driven by wind or not, unless:\n                    a.     the building or structure first sustains\n                           damage by an insured loss to its roof or\n                           walls through which the rain, snow, sleet,\n                           ice, sand or dust enters; or\n                    b.     the loss is caused by thawing of snow,\n                           sleet or ice on the building or structure\n                           ....\n      ....\n      LOSSES NOT INSURED\n             ....\n             2.

On December 27, Amish Connection filed a civil\n\naction against its landlord and the mall operator alleging they had\n\nconcealed the water infiltration problem the tenant discovered when\n\nceiling tiles were removed after the drainpipe failed. Amish Connection\n\nalleged those defendants “took insufficient efforts to remedy the water\n\ninfiltration problem and Defendants’ actions caused further water\n\ndamage to the lower level unit #102.”     The lawsuit further alleged the\n\nmall owner and operator “were guilty of gross negligence and willful\n\nmisconduct by renting [Suite 102] while knowing of, not disclosing, and\n\nnot taking remedial action to resolve the significant long-standing water\n\nproblems.”\n\n      On November 23, 2011, counsel for Amish Connection wrote to\n\nState Farm asking it to reconsider its denial of the claim and provide\n\ncoverage for the water damage. State Farm responded on December 22\n\nthat it would investigate further and cited paragraph 2(d) excluding\n\ncoverage for “rust, corrosion, . . . and deterioration,” in addition to the\n\nrain limitation in paragraph 6. On January 3, 2012, State Farm sent\n\nanother letter confirming its denial of coverage based on both provisions.\n\nOn January 20, Amish Connection moved to amend its petition to add\n\f                                   6\n\nState Farm as a defendant to a claim of breach of its insurance contract.\n\nAmish Connection later dismissed its claims against the mall owner and\n\noperator. The lawsuit proceeded against State Farm alone.\n\n      On July 27, State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment\n\nbased on paragraph 6 excluding coverage for “damage caused by rain.”\n\nAmish Connection resisted, arguing that the water damaging the interior\n\nof Suite 102 was no longer “rain,” and the actual cause of the loss was\n\nthe failure of the drainage pipe, falling within coverage under paragraph\n\n14. On October 18, the district court granted State Farm’s motion based\n\non paragraph 6, stating “as a matter of law the water running through\n\nthe pipe which caused the loss was rainwater.”        Amish Connection\n\nmoved for a more specific ruling to address its alternative argument\n\nunder the exception to the rust-and-corrosion exclusion for water\n\ndamage resulting from the “breaking or cracking of any part of a system\n\nor appliance containing water or steam.” State Farm resisted, arguing\n\nthat the ruling on the rain limitation was dispositive under the language\n\nof the insuring agreement that provides coverage for accidents “unless\n\nthe loss is: 1. limited [by the rain limitation]; or 2. Excluded in the\n\nLosses Not Insured section.” On December 20, the district court agreed\n\nwith State Farm’s interpretation and denied Amish Connection’s motion,\n\nstating:\n\n      The policy reads that “We insure for accidental physical loss\n      to property covered under this policy unless the loss is: 1)\n      Limited in the PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS\n      section; or 2) Excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED\n      section that follows.” (Emphasis Added). Therefore, if a loss\n      is excluded under either the PROPERTY SUBJECT TO\n      LIMITATIONS section or the LOSSES NOT INSURED section,\n      then it is excluded, and analysis under the other section is\n      not necessary. Therefore, the Court declines to rule on\n      whether the LOSSES NOT INSURED provision applies, as\n      the loss is already excluded by the other section.\n\f                                     7\n\n      Amish Connection appealed, and we transferred the case to the\n\ncourt of appeals. The court of appeals reversed the summary judgment,\n\nconcluding the “district court erred by finding the rain limitation [in\n\nparagraph 6] was applicable to this case.” The court of appeals, citing\n\ndictionaries and cases from other jurisdictions, distinguished “rain” from\n\n“rainwater”:\n\n      The definitions of “rain” and “rainwater,” although similar,\n      encompass two different points in time. As water is falling, it\n      is considered “rain.” After it has fallen—and, as here, been\n      collected on a rooftop and channeled into pipes for transport\n      to a storm sewer—it is considered “rainwater.”. . . While the\n      water emitting from the burst pipe may fall within the\n      definition of “rainwater,” it does not fall within the definition\n      of “rain”. Because loss caused by “rainwater” is not excluded\n      or otherwise limited under the policy, the district court erred\n      in interpolating the term “rainwater” into the policy and\n      concluding the interpolated term was unambiguous.\n\n      The court of appeals further concluded to the extent the limitation\n\nof coverage for damage “caused by rain” in paragraph 6 is ambiguous, it\n\nmust be construed against State Farm. The court of appeals determined\n\nthe parties’ arguments under other terms of the policy “are best\n\naddressed by the district court in the first instance” on remand.         We\n\ngranted State Farm’s application for further review.\n\n      II.

The fighting issue is whether the damage was\n\n“caused by rain” within the meaning of paragraph 6 of the limitations of\n\ncoverage. Neither side has offered any extrinsic evidence on the meaning\n\nof the insurance contract. Accordingly, its interpretation is for the court\n\nto decide. See id. (“Policy interpretation is always an issue for the court,\n\nunless we are required to rely upon extrinsic evidence or choose between\n\nreasonable inferences from extrinsic evidence.”).       We conclude State\n\nFarm was entitled to summary judgment in its favor based on the\n\nlimitation of coverage. Our holding is consistent with the decisions of\n\nother courts construing equivalent policy language.\n\n      Our rules governing the construction and interpretation of\n\ninsurance policies are well-settled. “The cardinal principle . . . is that the\n\nintent of the parties at the time the policy was sold must control.”\n\nLeMars Mut.

The Rain Limitation.         Applying these principles here, we\n\nconclude the rain limitation in paragraph 6 unambiguously defeats\n\ncoverage for the rainwater damage to Suite 102. This provision states\n\nthat subject to two exceptions the insurer “will not pay for loss . . . to the\n\ninterior of any building . . . or the property inside . . . caused by rain.”\n\nNeither exception applies. The first allows coverage if “the building . . .\n\nfirst sustains damage by an insured loss to its roof or walls through\n\nwhich the rain . . . enters.”   This exception would allow coverage, for\n\nexample, if a tornado dropped a tree on the roof, opening a hole through\n\nwhich rain entered.       Amish Connection alleges no damage to the\n\nbuilding’s roof or walls through which rain entered Suite 102. Rather,\n\nthe rainwater damage occurred when the interior drainpipe failed. The\n\f                                     10\n\nsecond exception to the rain limitation provision allows coverage if “the\n\nloss is caused by thawing of snow, sleet or ice on the building or\n\nstructure.” The June rainstorm involved no thawing of precipitates.\n\n      Amish Connection acknowledges these exceptions do not apply,\n\nbut argues the water damage in suite 102 was not “caused by rain”\n\nwithin the meaning of paragraph 6. It contends the water escaping the\n\nruptured drainpipe was no longer “rain” but rather “rainwater.”         The\n\ncourt of appeals agreed, stating, “We think it fair to say that a reasonable\n\nperson standing in the interior of a shopping mall underneath a burst\n\ndrainpipe would not conclude that he or she was standing in the ‘rain.’ ”\n\nTrue enough. But, “rainwater” unquestionably is “caused by rain,” and it\n\nis undisputed the water damage occurred during a rainstorm when the\n\ndrainpipe ruptured to spill rainwater into Suite 102.       We hold as a\n\nmatter of law that water damage is “caused by rain” within the meaning\n\nof paragraph 6 of the limitations of coverage when an interior drainpipe\n\nfails during a rainstorm and releases rainwater inside the building.\n\n      Under common parlance, damage caused by “rainwater” is “caused\n\nby rain.” If water is only considered rain while it is falling and becomes\n\nrainwater after it strikes a surface then the policy’s limitation on\n\ncoverage for damage “caused by rain” would be eviscerated. Water does\n\nnot damage property while merely falling through the air, but only after it\n\nstrikes a surface.   Under the court of appeals’ interpretation, the rain\n\nlimitation in the policy would be superfluous, and the coverage for\n\nrainwater damage would extend to leaky roofs and skylights.

The insured, like Amish\n\f                                    12\n\nConnection, argued the rain “stopped being ‘rain’ when it touched the\n\nroof,” as it was no longer falling from the sky.

App. 2014)\n(“Generally in interpreting a statute or a contract, we presume that the use of different\nwords indicates an intention that the words possess different meanings.”).\n        Rather, it is clear from reading State Farm’s policy as a whole that the terms\n“Specified Causes of Loss” and “insured loss” have different meanings, and a specified\ncause of loss is not a covered loss under some circumstances. For example, the defined\nspecified causes of loss include the “weight of snow, ice or sleet” in paragraph 13, yet\nthe policy specifically excludes losses to “gutters and downspouts caused by weight of\n\f                                           15\n\ndischarge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the\n\nbreaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing\n\nwater or steam.” Amish Connection contends the drainpipe that burst is\n\na “system or appliance containing water.”              If so, the water damage to\n\nSuite 102 would fall within an exception to the separate exclusion for\n\n“rust, corrosion, [and] deterioration.” 3         But, standing alone, paragraph\n\n14 would not create coverage for rain damage because an exception to an\n\nexclusion does not create coverage that otherwise is lacking.                    As the\n\nIndiana Court of Appeals observed:\n\n              In general, “an exception to an exclusion cannot create\n       coverage where none exists. Exclusion clauses do not grant\n       or enlarge coverage; rather, they are limitations on the\n       insuring clause.” “In simplistic terms, the process is such: if\n       the insuring clause does not extend coverage, one need look\n       no further. If coverage exists, exclusions must then be\n       considered. If an exclusion excludes coverage, an exception\n       to the exclusion may re-grant coverage.”\n\n\n\n\n______________________\nsnow, sleet or ice” in limitation 9. Thus, merely because a matter is included within the\npolicy’s defined “Specified Causes of Loss” does not mean it cannot be subject to a\nseparate limitation or exclusion.\n       3State  Farm previously relied on that exclusion in addition to the rain limitation\nin denying the insurance claim. At oral argument, counsel for State Farm noted it was\nno longer relying on that exclusion found in the “LOSSES NOT INSURED” section of the\npolicy, which provides:\n                2.    We do not insure for loss either consisting of, or directly\n                      and immediately caused by, one or more of the following:\n                      ....\n                      d.     smog, wear, tear, rust, corrosion, fungus, mold,\n                             decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any\n                             quality in property that causes it to damage or\n                             destroy itself.\n                             But if accidental direct physical loss by any of the\n                             \"Specified Causes of Loss\" or by building glass\n                             breakage results, we will pay for that resulting loss\n                             ....\n\f                                        16\n\nHartford Cas.

We also assume the water damage in this\n\ncase would not have occurred but for both the rainstorm and the failure\n\nof the interior drainpipe. That is, the breaking of the drainpipe was a\n\nconcurrent cause of the water damage to the office and its contents.\n\n      Nevertheless, paragraph 14 does not provide coverage because\n\nState Farm’s policy effectively has an anticoncurrent-cause provision.\n\nThis means the rain limitation controls regardless of whether the\n\nbreaking drainpipe is considered a concurrent cause of the rainwater\n\ndamage. The operative anticoncurrent-cause language turns on the word\n\n“or” in the lead paragraph of Section I of the policy, entitled “LOSSES\n\nINSURED AND LOSSES NOT INSURED”:\n\n      We insure for accidental direct physical loss to property\n      covered under this policy unless the loss is:\n            1.    limited in the PROPERTY           SUBJECT      TO\n                  LIMITATIONS section; or\n            2.    excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section\n                  that follows.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The district court quoted and relied on this provision\n\nin denying Amish Connection’s motion for a more specific ruling on\n\nsummary judgment.       The “or” in this provision is disjunctive.

As the district court correctly concluded, this means\n\nthere is no coverage under the State Farm policy for property damage\n\nresulting under circumstances triggering either a limitation of loss in the\n\nfirst numbered paragraph or an exclusion in the second. That is, if the\n\f                                       18\n\nrain limitation applies, it does not matter whether this property loss\n\notherwise falls within the “water system break” exception to the rust\n\nexclusion.\n\n      This makes sense.         Water damage resulting from a breaking\n\nsprinkler or hot water pipe or radiator could be covered despite the rust-\n\nand-corrosion exclusion, but not water damage resulting from a breaking\n\ngutter or roof drainpipe for rainwater subject to the rain limitation. Why\n\nthe difference? Because the insurer expects the property owner to keep\n\nthe rain out and writes the policy to avoid paying for damage from rain\n\nresulting from deferred maintenance. See Petrick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3257894</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*5 (applying rain limitation as intended to avoid insuring for damage\n\nresulting from deferred maintenance).           Under Amish Connection’s\n\ninterpretation, rain damage resulting from breaking gutters or drainpipes\n\nwould be covered, and the “or” in Section I would be replaced with the\n\nconjunctive “and” such that a loss is covered unless it is both within the\n\nrain limitation and (not “or”) excluded separately.      We will not rewrite\n\nclear policy language.   See Boelman, 826 N.W.2d at 502.

Indeed, in Corrigan, we specifically held\n\nthe omission of an anticoncurrent-cause provision in the liability section\n\nof the homeowners’ policy did not create ambiguity even though such a\n\nprovision was included in the property insurance section of the same\n\npolicy.     697 N.W.2d at 114–15.

In Kalell, the homeowners policy\n\nexcluded coverage for bodily injury arising out of use of a motor vehicle\n\nowned by the insured. Id. at 866.

Id. at 869.   These cases do not help\n\nAmish Connection because neither case involved an anticoncurrent-\n\ncause provision and paragraph 14 is not an independent coverage grant,\n\nbut rather merely removes breaking pipes from the rust-and-corrosion\n\nexclusion.\n\n      More recently, in Corrigan, parents of a child injured in day care\n\nsued the day-care providers, who sought liability coverage under their\n\nhomeowners policy.       697 N.W.2d at 109–110.            The policy excluded\n\ncoverage for “bodily injury . . . arising out of . . . violation of any criminal\n\nlaw for which any insured is convicted.” Id. at 110. One insured was\n\nconvicted of child endangerment. Id. at 109–10. Another was sued for\n\nnegligent supervision. Id. at 110. We held the insurer was entitled to\n\nsummary      judgment    based    on     the    criminal   act   exclusion   and\n\ndistinguished Kalell, noting that the covered and excluded acts were not\n\n“independent” because to prove negligent supervision, one had to prove\n\nthe underlying tort by the person who was not properly supervised. Id.\n\nat 112–13.     That is, there would have been no injury without the\n\nexcluded criminal act. See id. Similarly, there would have been no water\n\ndamage here but for the rainfall, and damage caused by this rain is not\n\f                                    21\n\ncovered.

Id. at 842. The insurer failed to show that the\n\ntarps collapsed during a rainfall.         Id. at 844.   The trial court\n\nacknowledged “it is clear that the Policy was not intended to cover\n\ndamage to the interior of the Building stemming from rain.” Id. at 845.\n\nThe trial court distinguished water damage from rain that directly enters\n\na building during a rainstorm from damage resulting from pooled\n\n“surface water” that had collected in the tarps.    Id. at 844.   The trial\n\ncourt denied the insurer’s motion for summary judgment on the rain\n\nlimitation, stating:\n\n      The ordinary business person purchasing the Policy at issue\n      here would not have expected the Rain Limitation to apply to\n      an incident in which a temporary, man-made structure\n      collected rainwater, diverting it from the ground and into the\n      policyholder’s Building.     Therefore, the Rain Limitation\n      cannot be used to disclaim covered for damage and losses\n      stemming from the September Incident.\n\nId. at 845.     Wider is distinguishable from this case in which the\n\ndrainpipe, installed to carry rainwater falling on the roof to the storm\n\f                                    22\n\nsewer, failed and spilled rainwater as it flowed down during the\n\nrainstorm.     Nor are we persuaded by Tento International, Inc. v.

Because I believe a genuine issue of material fact\n\nremains on the question whether the loss was in fact caused by rain or,\n\ninstead, by some other covered occurrence (or a combination of covered\n\nand uncovered occurrences), summary judgment is inappropriate and\n\nthe case should proceed to trial.\n\n      “Causation has always been a troublesome concept for lawyers.”\n\nBanks McDowell, Causation in Contracts and Insurance, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Particularly troublesome are\n\ninstances of “dual or concurrent causation—where two or more\n\noccurrences lead to a loss and at least one is covered under the terms of\n\na single insurance policy.” Id. at 570 (footnotes omitted). In my view,\n\nthis case presents one such instance. Amish Connection suffered a loss\n\nwhen a pipe burst during a heavy rainstorm. State Farm asserts the loss\n\nwas “caused by rain” because the pipe would not have failed without the\n\nvolume of water the storm produced. Yet, the summary judgment record\n\nin this case leaves room for a reasonable fact finder to find the loss\n\nAmish Connection suffered would not have occurred as a consequence of\n\nthe rain alone, but only because the pipe failed while the rainwater was\n\npassing through it. In other words, a fact question remains whether the\n\nloss might not have occurred but for the confluence of at least two\n\f                                      25\n\ncauses. See Randall L.

This case presents a causation and coverage quandary: Water\n\ndamage caused by accidental leakage is a “Specified Cause of Loss”\n\nunder the policy, but losses “caused by rain” are excluded.\n\n      In concurrent causation scenarios, some jurisdictions utilize a\n\n“liberal approach” to coverage under which an entire loss is covered as\n\nlong as it was caused in part by a covered occurrence. See id. at 976 &\n\nn.56 (listing the “minority of states” that follow this rule).     Under this\n\napproach, if two events combine to cause the loss—one covered and one\n\nexcluded—coverage exists even though the excluded event was a cause.\n\nWhile this rule “is not perfect,” it “promulgates a fairer result in\n\ninstances where two . . . concurrent causes produce the loss and neither\n\non its own is sufficient to cause some harm.”            Id. at 984; see also\n\nBrendan R.

For\n\nexample, paragraph 1 of the “LOSSES NOT INSURED” section reads:\n\n      1.    We do not insure under any coverage for any loss\n            which would not have occurred in the absence of one\n            or more of the following excluded events. We do not\n            insure for such loss regardless of: (a) the cause of the\n            excluded event; or (b) other causes of the loss; or (c)\n            whether other causes acted concurrently or in any\n            sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss[.]\n\nThe “following excluded events” to which this provision refers are:\n\nenforcement of any ordinance or law; earth movement; volcanic eruption;\n\nwater such as flood, surface water, waves, tides, mudslides, sewer\nbackup, and seeping groundwater; seizure or destruction of property by\n\norder of governmental authority; nuclear hazard; failure of power to the\n\npremises; and war or military action.\n\n      Paragraph 3 of the LOSSES NOT INSURED section contains\n\nadditional anticoncurrent-cause language:\n\n      We do not insure for any coverage for any loss consisting of\n      one or more of the items below. Further, we do not insure\n      for loss described in paragraphs 1. or 2. immediately above\n      regardless of whether one or more of the following: (a)\n      directly or indirectly cause, contribute to or aggravate the\n      loss; or (b) occur before, at the same time, or after the loss or\n      any other cause of the loss[.]\n\f                                   36\n\nState Farm did not raise either of these provisions in its motion for\n\nsummary judgment.      Nor did it raise them in its resistance to Amish\n\nConnection’s motion for more specific ruling. Instead, State Farm relied\n\nexclusively on language from a different section: the LOSSES INSURED\n\nsection. Notably, State Farm expressly argued the district court need not\n\nconsider any language from the LOSSES NOT INSURED section.           The\n\ndistrict court agreed, and even when it denied Amish Connection’s\n\nmotion for a more specific ruling, the court expressly relied only on the\n\nLOSSES INSURED section of the policy.\n\n      The majority concludes State Farm’s reliance on the LOSSES\n\nINSURED policy provision effectively raised any anticoncurrent-cause\n\nprovisions in the policy. I strongly disagree. Both anticoncurrent-cause\n\nprovisions are in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section—and State Farm\n\nexpressly asserted the district court should not even consider language\n\nfrom that section in making its summary judgment decision.\n\n      I acknowledge the maxim that “[t]he individual provisions of a\n\npolicy must be read in conjunction with the policy as a whole.” Ferguson\n\nv.

Further, even if we were to consider policy provisions—the\n\nLOSSES NOT INSURED section—not relied upon by State Farm in the\n\ndistrict court or the court itself in its summary judgment ruling, we\n\nshould not find them sufficient to decide the coverage question in this\n\ncase as a matter of law.\n\n      Amish Connection is not covered if its loss was “caused by rain,”\n\nas stated in the PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS section, or if it\n\f                                    37\n\nis excluded in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section. I acknowledge that\n\nthe word “or” is disjunctive in this context. But whether the loss was\n\n“caused by rain”—or by some other covered cause—is the fighting issue\n\nin this case.   In my view, provisions in the LOSSES NOT INSURED\n\nsection leave wide open the possibility that causes of loss other than rain\n\nare not excluded—even when concurrent causes are involved—and are\n\ntherefore still in play here. A jury should be entitled to resolve factual\n\nquestions like these.\n\n      I begin with paragraph 1 of the LOSSES NOT INSURED section.\n\nParagraph 1 excludes any loss concurrently caused, even in part, by\n\noccurrences from a list of “excluded events.”          These events are\n\npredominantly large-scale disasters—earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,\n\nnuclear meltdowns.      Paragraph 1(d) includes “surface water” as an\n\nexcluded event.   However, because surface water is included in a list\n\nalongside flood, waves, tides, mudslides, and groundwater seepage, it is\n\nevident—using the canon of noscitur a sociis—that surface water in\n\nparagraph 1(d) does not include the rainfall in this case.     See Black’s\n\nLaw Dictionary 1224 (10th ed. 2014) (explaining that noscitur a sociis\n\nmeans the definition of a word or phrase “should be determined by the\n\nwords immediately surrounding it”). None of the other “excluded events”\n\nin paragraph 1 are remotely applicable to this case.          Accordingly,\n\nparagraph 1 does not preclude the possibility that, if Amish Connection’s\n\nloss had multiple causes—one excluded and one covered—a jury could\n\nfind the covered hazard was predominant and should afford Amish\n\nConnection coverage in this case.\n\n      I now turn to paragraph 3.     This paragraph’s language must be\n\nunpacked carefully. The first sentence states: “We do not insure for any\n\ncoverage for any loss consisting of one or more of the items below.”\n\f                                    38\n\n(Emphasis added.). The “items below” are subparts 3(a) and 3(b). 3(a)\n\nrefers to “conduct, acts or decisions, including the failure to act or\n\ndecide, of any person . . . , whether intentional, wrongful, negligent or\n\nwithout fault”—essentially third-party negligence. 3(b) refers to “faulty,\n\ninadequate, unsound or defective” planning, design, construction,\n\nmaterials, and maintenance.         But, as I have explained, Amish\n\nConnection’s loss does not consist of third-party negligence or faulty\n\nmaintenance; if it did, the only costs for which Amish Connection would\n\nbe seeking coverage would be the cost of repairing or replacing the failed\n\npipe. Therefore, this first sentence of paragraph 3, standing alone, would\n\nnot preclude coverage for a loss “caused by”—not “consisting of”—faulty\n\nmaintenance.\n\n      The next sentence of paragraph 3 provides:\n\n      [W]e do not insure for loss described in paragraphs 1. and 2.\n      immediately above regardless of whether [the causes\n      described in 3(a) and 3(b)]: (a) directly or indirectly cause,\n      contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the\n      same time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss[.]\n\nAs I have explained, paragraph 1 immediately above this language\n\ncontains “excluded events” that are all inapplicable to the factual\n\ncircumstances of this case. Paragraph 2 “immediately above” describes\n\nsixteen types of loss, in subparts 2(a) through 2(p). Only two of these\n\ncould possibly be relevant here.     Paragraph 2(k)—in conjunction with\n\nparagraph 3—excludes coverage for loss caused by “continuous or\n\nrepeated seepage or leakage of water that occurs over a period of time”\n\nwhen that seepage combines with third-party negligence or faulty\n\nmaintenance.    However, the loss (water-soaked and ruined inventory)\n\nclaimed in this case by Amish Connection was not due to continued or\n\f                                    39\n\nrepeated seepage or leakage; it was due to a one-time event—the burst\n\npipe.\n\n        Paragraph 2(d) is the only other subpart of paragraph 2 that could\n\npossibly be relevant here.      It excludes loss caused by—not merely\n\nconsisting of—rust, corrosion, and deterioration.          Combined with\n\nparagraph 3, paragraph 2(d) could, at first blush, reasonably be read to\n\nexclude coverage if faulty maintenance caused the pipe to rust, which in\n\nturn caused the water damage in this case.       However, paragraph 2(d)\n\ncontains an additional statement: “But if accidental direct physical loss\n\nby any of the ‘Specified Causes of Loss’ . . . results, we will pay for that\n\nresulting loss[.]” (Emphasis added.). In other words, although most loss\n\ncaused by rust, corrosion, or deterioration is excluded, “Specified Causes\n\nof Loss” are still covered. As I have noted above, the Specified Causes of\n\nLoss under this policy include “water damage” arising from “accidental\n\ndischarge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the\n\nbreaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing\n\nwater or steam.” Thus, even if there is evidence that faulty maintenance\n\nof the pipe allowed it to rust and ultimately fail, Amish Connection’s loss\n\nis not excluded from coverage under paragraph 3(b).\n\n        My colleagues in the majority stress the fact that, according to\n\nState Farm, the policy was never intended to cover faulty maintenance.\n\nWhatever State Farm’s intent, however, the actual policy language belies\n\nthat assumption.      The final clause of paragraph 3 states: “But if\n\naccidental direct physical loss results from items 3.a. and 3.b., we will\n\npay for that resulting loss unless the resulting loss is itself one of the\n\nlosses not insured in this section.”     Item 3(b) is faulty maintenance.\n\nThus, this express policy language indicates State Farm will pay for loss\n\nresulting from faulty maintenance unless the resulting loss is not\n\f                                     40\n\ninsured in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section.              Crucially, the rain\n\nlimitation is not found in the LOSSES NOT INSURED section. In sum,\n\neven if State Farm and the district court had relied on the LOSSES NOT\n\nINSURED section of the policy—and here they clearly didn’t—summary\n\njudgment would not have been appropriate in this case.\n\n      Although the majority attempts to distinguish it, the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s decision in Tento International is actually quite analogous to this\n\ncase. See Tento Int’l, 222 F.3d at 661. A roofing contractor was making\n\nrepairs but failed to install a temporary covering.           Id.   “Almost\n\npredictably, rain fell and damaged Tento’s electronics equipment.”        Id.\n\nTento’s insurance policy with State Farm contained a rain limitation\n\nidentical to the one in Amish Connection’s policy, and it also contained\n\nan identical paragraph 3. See id. at 661–62. The court determined the\n\nefficient cause, not merely the most immediate cause, should determine\n\ncoverage—even though the policy had several provisions materially\n\nidentical to the ones in Amish Connection’s policy. See id. at 662.\n\n      Further, the court examined the “inexact wording in the resulting-\n\nloss provision.” Id. It determined Tento had coverage as a matter of law:\n\n             The resulting-loss provision states that, “if accidental\n      direct physical loss results from items 3.a. and 3.b. [i.e., the\n      contractor’s third-party negligence], we will pay for that\n      resulting loss unless the resulting loss is itself one of the\n      losses not insured in this section.” (emphasis added). The\n      question becomes whether the resulting loss—damage to\n      Tento’s goods by rain—is “one of the losses not insured in\n      this section.” (emphasis added). The words “in this section\n      appear in numbered paragraph 3 of the LOSSES NOT\n      INSURED section of the policy. Logically, then, the words “in\n      this section” refer to the LOSSES NOT INSURED section and\n      that section does not preclude coverage for rain damage.\n\n            We recognize it is arguable that the scope of the “in\n      this section” phrase could refer to the entire basic coverage\n      of Section I, which includes the LOSSES INSURED as well as\n      the LOSSES NOT INSURED sections.               The LOSSES\n\f                                    41\n      INSURED section incorporates by reference the earlier\n      PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS section, and that\n      section includes the rain-damage limitation. Under this\n      reading, the policy would not provide coverage for Tento’s\n      rain-damaged goods.         We reject this reading, however,\n      because it is illogical, and defies a common-sense reading of\n      the policy. Moreover, we note that when the policy refers to\n      the entire “Section I,” it uses an upper case “S” to signal this\n      broader reference.\n\nId. at 663. Amish Connection’s policy also uses an uppercase S when\nreferring to the entire Section I. Applying the Tento analysis to the facts\nof this case, Amish Connection might have coverage as a matter of law—\nalthough its loss might fit more squarely under the paragraph 3(b) faulty\nmaintenance provision than under the paragraph 3(a) third-party\nnegligence provision.\n      But I do not advocate we go that far on this record.        Rather, I\nconclude the summary judgment should be reversed and the case\nremanded for trial.      The evidence will establish whether Amish\nConnection’s loss was due to the mall’s faulty maintenance, or rust,\ndecay, or some other cause or combination of causes. Although coverage\nis excluded if the loss was caused by rain, it could also have been caused\nby something else, or by a combination of other causes for which\ncoverage exists.\n      When reviewing summary judgment rulings, we must make all\nfactual inferences supported by the record in the nonmovant’s favor.\nSee, e.g., Hagenow v.
