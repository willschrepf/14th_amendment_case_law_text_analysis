This appeal arises from Donna Samuels’\n\n(“Samuels”) suit against her former employer, Corizon, LLC (“Corizon”), formerly known as\n\nCorizon, Inc. and incorrectly identified in this action as Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nSamuels alleges that Corizon discriminated against her in the terms and conditions of her\n\nemployment because of her race and engaged in conduct that was harassing, discriminatory, and\n\nretaliatory, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., and the\n\nKentucky Civil Rights Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. § 344.010 et seq. The district court granted Corizon’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, finding that Samuels’s race discrimination claim failed because\n\nshe had presented no evidence of disparate treatment from similarly situated individuals who are\n\nnot members of her protected class, and that her retaliation claim failed because she had\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\npresented no evidence suggesting that Corizon’s proffered reasons for any adverse employment\n\naction were pretextual. Samuels v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., No. 12-CV-301-JMH, 2014 WL\n\n2506466, at *6-8 (E.D. Ky. June 3, 2014). Samuels now appeals the district court’s judgment on\n\nher retaliation claim. We AFFIRM.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Corizon contracts with state, county, and municipal agencies to provide medical and\n\ndental services to incarcerated individuals. One facility at which Corizon provides these services\n\nis the Lexington-Fayette County Detention Center (“LFCDC”) in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nCorizon’s employees at the LFCDC include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse\n\npractitioners, physicians, dentists, medical records clerks, and various administrative personnel.\n\nCorizon only staffs two medical records clerks at the LFCDC: one part-time employee, and one\n\nfull-time employee.    Both employees are supervised by the Health Services Administrator\n\n(“HSA”). Another third-party entity, Bluegrass Mental Health—Comprehensive Care (“Comp\n\nCare”), provides mental health services to inmates at LFCDC. Corizon’s medical records staff\n\nmaintains and stores medical records for all inmates at LFCDC, and Corizon is the custodian of\n\nthese records.\n\n       Samuels, an African American, first worked for Corizon as a medical records clerk from\n\nApril 4, 2005 to May 9, 2007, when she voluntarily resigned. Samuels returned to work for\n\nCorizon on November 19, 2007. During this second period of employment, Samuels was hired\n\nas an “as needed” medical records clerk. Samuels eventually became the part-time medical\n\nrecords clerk. During this time period, Samuels worked with one other full-time medical records\n\nclerk, Michelle Brown, and both clerks were under the supervision of the HSA. Brown is also\n\nAfrican American. At the time of Samuels’ rehire, the HSA was Jonathan Bowen.\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n        When Corizon first hired Samuels, she attended the company’s orientation program,\n\nduring which she became familiar with Corizon’s personnel policies and procedures as set out in\n\na manual entitled “Corizon Employee Success Guide” (“Guide”). Each employee receives a\n\ncopy of the Guide at the time of hire and an additional copy each time the Guide is revised.\n\nAccordingly, Samuels, as acknowledged through her signature, received copies of the Guide on\n\nthe date of her rehire, November 19, 2007, and received her latest copy of the Guide on March\n\n30, 2012.\n\n        Upon her rehire, Samuels also received and acknowledged that she read and fully\n\nunderstood the Medical Records Clerk Position Description. This Position Description was one\n\nof many Samuels would receive during the course of her employment with Corizon. According\n\nto the Position Description, her essential functions as a medical records clerk constituted the\n\nfollowing: retrieving medical charts for all health care staff or clinics as requested; filing daily all\n\ncurrently used medical records; ensuring that charts are countersigned by a physician and\n\nchecking charts for completeness; releasing information at the direction of the Medical Records\n\nSupervisor, Medical Director, or HSA; securing all active and inactive medical records;\n\nanswering the telephone, taking messages, and making telephone calls; typing letters, reports,\n\nand memoranda; maintaining a roster or appointment book of scheduled appointments for on-\n\nand off-site appointments; ordering, receiving, and maintaining office supplies; adhering to\n\nsafety and security policies and participating in disaster drills; demonstrating an ability to deal\n\nwith and respond to stressful situations in a stressful environment; and maintaining regular and\n\nreliable attendance.\n\n        Additionally, the Position Description set forth performance expectations for medical\n\nrecords clerks, including, in relevant part: performance of all clerical duties related to the\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nassembling and maintaining of medical records; maintaining accountability for the location of\n\nany medical record on file; taking on direct responsibility to pull records and deliver for clinical\n\nuse; re-filing medical records upon completion of use; pulling records and performing studies as\n\nrequested by the Director of Nursing (“DON”); and completing reports and performing other\n\nduties as assigned by the HSA. Samuels admits that, as a medical records clerk, she was\n\nresponsible for maintaining health records for the sick call, dental, and mental health clinics for\n\nthe entire detention center. Samuels further admits that she was responsible for re-filing records\n\nand organizing the files. Samuels also concedes that her job duties included providing assistance\n\nto staff members in locating charts in the medical records department, and updating and filing\n\nmedical records charts when they were returned from the clinic. Samuels testified, however, that\n\nin practice, health care staff members, rather than medical records clerks, were responsible for\n\nretrieving and signing out their own charts. Additionally, while she admitted to re-filing records,\n\nSamuels testified that she was not directly responsible for pulling records and delivering them for\n\nclinical use, as listed in the performance expectations section of the Position Description.\n\n       Samuels was evaluated on her job performance annually.             On February 27, 2009,\n\nSamuels received an evaluation prepared by Bowen, which gave her an overall rating of “A”1\n\nand listed two areas for improvement: (1) “a need to communicate with administration when\n\nscheduling issues arise,” and (2) “a need to communicate with peers when issues arise.”\n\nApproximately a year later, on March 8, 2010, Samuels received another evaluation from\n\nBowen, which again gave her an overall rating of “A” and listed the same areas of improvement\n\nas her 2009 evaluation.     The evaluation also contained a Developmental Agreement which\n\n1\n According to the evaluation form, a rating of “A” connotes that the employee’s performance\nlevel is that “expected of [a] fully qualified person” and that the employee “[d]emonstrates\nconsistent, competent[, and] solid performance.” There is, therefore, no support for Samuels’\nclaim on appeal that an “A” rating “meant that she fully understood her job duties. . . .”\n                                                -4-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nprovided that Bowen and Samuels agreed to work together for her benefit on the following\n\nareas: (1) “work to communicate issues that arise in sick call before they turn into bigger\n\nproblems”; (2) “maintain clinic environment throughout the day in sick call”; and (3) “work\n\ntogether to find other ways to improve sick call flow.”\n\n       Samuels received another annual job evaluation on March 7, 2011, from the new HSA,\n\nEricka Burnside. Burnside is also African American. Like the prior two years, this evaluation\n\nassigned Samuels an overall rating of “A” and listed the same two areas in need of improvement.\n\nThe evaluation also included a Developmental Agreement, which provided that Burnside and\n\nSamuels would agree to work for Samuels’ benefit in the following areas: (1) “work to\n\ncommunicate issues that arise in the medical records area with administrator ASAP”;\n\n(2) “maintain records and keep the medical records area neat and orderly at all times”; and\n\n(3) “work together with all members of the health care team to help improve upon effective\n\ncommunication and decrease workload.”\n\n       In April 2011, Patricia Tomlin became the new HSA. Beginning in August of 2011,\n\nemployees in other areas of the detention center began submitting written complaints to Tomlin\n\nabout Samuels and Michelle Brown, the other medical records clerk. These complaints largely\n\nconcerned Samuels’ and Brown’s attitudes, communication skills, and general unwillingness to\n\nassist in retrieving medical records. Specifically, on August 2, 2011, Tomlin received an email\n\nfrom Crystal Shadd (“Shadd”), the Director of Comp Care, complaining that when Dana Mullins\n\n(“Mullins”), a case manager with Comp Care, sought help in locating a mislabeled file, Samuels\n\nand Brown were rude and refused to assist Mullins in locating the file. Shadd also noted that she\n\nhad had similar problems with Samuels and Brown in the past. Two days later, on August 4,\n\n2011, Mullins herself e-mailed Corizon to discuss the above-mentioned difficulty with Samuels\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nand Brown, and to report another instance that same day in which Samuels and Brown had\n\nrefused to help her locate a requested file.\n\n       Subsequently, on August 11, 2011, Tomlin received another email from Shadd about an\n\nincident she witnessed between a dentist and both medical records clerks. Shadd reported that\n\nshe observed the dentist ask for a specific chart, and neither Samuels nor her co-clerk assisted\n\nhim in finding the record. Shadd noted that the dentist seemed frustrated with the lack of\n\nassistance, and, ultimately, Shadd volunteered to help him locate the chart. Thereafter, on\n\nAugust 16, 2011, Nicole Marinaro (“Marinaro”), a Corizon phlebotomist, emailed Tomlin\n\ndetailing instances of Samuels’ and Brown’s rudeness and unprofessional behavior when\n\nMarinaro needed assistance with locating charts.\n\n       As a result of these complaints, Tomlin and Levin Jones (“Jones”), Corizon’s Vice\n\nPresident of Operations, who is African American, verbally counselled Samuels on August 18,\n\n2011. Afterward, Tomlin memorialized this discussion in a memorandum to Samuels, indicating\n\nthat Samuels was “expected to treat all staff and departments with dignity and respect” and “to\n\nperform [her] job duties which include retrieving medical records when asked, and in a friendly\n\nand helpful manner.” The memorandum specifically noted that Samuels was “expected to\n\ncomply with [her] job description which [she] read and signed on 11/11/07 [and] which clearly\n\ndefines [her] roll [sic] in retrieving medical records.” Samuels refused to sign the memorandum,\n\nwhich was placed in her personnel file. Jones, however, explained to Samuels that the verbal\n\ncounseling was not disciplinary action, and that the memorandum would be removed from her\n\nfile after six months. Samuels admits that Jones’ explanation was consistent with the Corizon\n\nEmployee Success Guide, and that following her meeting with Tomlin and Jones, she understood\n\nthat she was responsible for retrieving medical records.\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       Nonetheless, on September 29, 2011, Shanna Meyers, a Nurse Practitioner at the facility,\n\nsubmitted a letter of complaint detailing further instances of Samuels’ and Brown’s continued\n\nrudeness and general unprofessional behavior, their failure to assist staff members in locating\n\ncharts, and their failure to follow the proper procedure for thinning medical records. Shortly\n\nthereafter, on October 3, 2011, Corizon received another email from Shadd, forwarding a\n\ncomplaint from Mullins. Specifically, Mullins reported an incident on September 26, 2011,\n\nwhere Samuels responded with negativity when Mullins asked her about a document placed in\n\nthe Comp Care mailbox. Mullins also indicated that the continued negativity from Samuels\n\nmade her loath to ask for assistance in locating charts in the medical records department.\n\n       After receiving these two additional complaints, Tomlin sought the advice of Human\n\nResources Specialist Stephanie Good (“Good”) as to whether these incidents warranted\n\ncorrective disciplinary action against Samuels. Good advised Tomlin to talk to Samuels and get\n\n“her side of the story.”     In accordance with this directive, Samuels was not issued any\n\ndisciplinary action; instead, Tomlin met with Mullins and Samuels together in her office and also\n\ndirected Samuels to provide a statement setting forth “her side of the story.” The day after the\n\nmeeting, on October 4, 2011, Samuels submitted a written statement as directed, via facsimile to\n\nGood, in regard to the September 26, 2011 incident and other issues. According to Samuels’\n\nwritten statement and deposition testimony, Samuels was upset that Tomlin spoke with her in\n\nMullins’ presence about the September 26 incident. Samuels further noted in her statement that\n\nduring the meeting, Tomlin stated “this has got to stop,” that Samuels and Mullins had to work\n\ntogether, that she was “sick of this s—t,” and that maybe Samuels needed to find another job.\n\n       Samuels’ written statement also expressed that she felt harassed and discriminated\n\nagainst based on what were, to her, anonymous complaints. According to Samuels, when she\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nasked Jones during the August 18, 2011 meeting who made the complaints, Jones allegedly only\n\nstated there were a number of complaints and the complaints had come from “jail staff.”\n\nSamuels apparently understood “jail staff” to mean correctional officers. Thus, according to\n\nSamuels’ written statement, on September 28, 2011, she began her “own investigation” into the\n\ncomplaints by talking to Major Hill, “who is over the Medical Department at the jail.” The next\n\nday, on September 29, 2011, a memorandum was distributed to all Corizon employees. The\n\nmemorandum related to safety and security in the jail setting and specifically forbade “[a]ll\n\nCorizon staff” from leaving their assigned medical areas unless directed to do so by the HSA or\n\nthe Director of Nursing. In her written statement, however, Samuels expressed her belief that the\n\nmemorandum was actually directed at Samuels and her co-clerk in medical records as a form of\n\nretaliation because Samuels spoke with Major Hill.\n\n          Good followed up on the concerns Samuels expressed in her written statement. Among\n\nother things, Good directed Tomlin to revise and reissue the memorandum previously distributed\n\nto all Corizon employees to include an explanation to the staff why the memorandum was issued.\n\nGood also verbally counseled Tomlin about her use of profanity during her meeting with\n\nSamuels and Mullins. Tomlin complied with Good’s directive on October 13, 2011, and revised\n\nthe memorandum in regard to staff’s movement in the facility by including an explanation as to\n\nwhy she was issuing the directive.\n\n          On December 8, 2011, Samuels filed an initial charge with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and amended that charge on January 26, 2012. Samuels\n\nalleged discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.2\n\n\n\n2\n    Specifically, Samuels alleged, in relevant part:\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       Meanwhile, the complaints against Samuels and Brown continued into 2012. On March\n\n27, 2012, Kristin Malone (“Malone”), DON, went to the medical records department to request,\n\nfor use by Malone and Tomlin, two copies of an individual’s chart in order to complete an\n\ninternal reporting process. Despite a request by a direct supervisor and the fact that “pulling\n\nrecords and performing studies as requested by the Director of Nursing” is expressly listed as a\n\nperformance expectation in the Position Description for medical records clerks, Samuels refused\n\nto comply. Instead, Samuels stated that she and Brown could not make such copies without\n\nhaving a release, even though a release is not required for Corizon’s internal use of the medical\n\nrecords.\n\n       As a result of this incident, and consistent with the policies in Corizon’s Guide, Samuels\n\nreceived written counseling from Jones and Tomlin on March 29, 2012, for insubordination.\n\nAccording to the memorandum from Jones to Samuels memorializing the meeting, Jones and\n\nTomlin reiterated Samuels’ job responsibilities to her and again expressly noted that Samuels\n\nwas “expected to comply with direct orders from [her] direct supervisor as well as medical\n\nproviders and the director of nursing.” Additionally, during this meeting, Jones and Tomlin\n\nprovided Samuels with further written clarification of her job duties. Samuels refused to read or\n\nsign the memorandum. Samuels admits, however, that she was told to read and become familiar\n\n\n\n       In August 15, 2011 [sic], I was written up by manager Trish Tomlin. I was told\n       that my co workers had complained about me being rude and disrespectful. In\n       September 29, 2011, we all received a letter stating that no Corizon employee is\n       allowed to leave their assigned area or assigned job duties unless you have been\n       directed to do so by the HAS/DON [sic]. I feel this letter was sent directly to me.\n       On October 3, 2011, I sent in a formal complaint about racial discrimination to\n       human resources. This was after my co-worker Donna Mullins [sic] (White)\n       made a complaint about me. I believe that my manager was biased during the\n       investigation since she told me in front of my coworker that she was sick of this\n       shit and maybe I should find me another job. I also believe I am being retaliated\n       against because I feel harassed and no one had responded to my complaint. . . .\n                                              -9-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nwith the job description because she was expected to perform all duties listed or face further\n\naction, including termination.\n\n       Additionally, on March 28, 2012, Tomlin directed Samuels and Brown that they were to\n\nstagger their lunch breaks and other breaks to ensure that one of them would be available at all\n\ntimes during working hours, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., to pull charts as requested by the medical\n\nstaff. Samuels refused to read or sign this latest memorandum. Samuels admits, however, that\n\naccess to these medical records was necessary for the health care staff or clinics to provide care\n\nfor inmates residing in the detention center, and that Tomlin and Jones explained that the\n\ndirective was necessary so that someone in medical records could pull these records in the event\n\nthat a medical provider needed a chart or information. Samuels remained free to schedule her\n\nlunch with other Corizon employees working outside of the medical records department.\n\n       Samuels also received a copy of her annual evaluation on March 29, 2012. Tomlin\n\ncompleted the evaluation and ranked Samuels as “substantially missing” a majority of the job\n\ngoals. Samuels’ evaluation noted that she failed to perform tasks outlined in her job description,\n\nfailed to readily perform tasks assigned by her supervisor, did not work well with co-workers and\n\ncontract staff, lacked a professional demeanor such that staff felt uncomfortable approaching her\n\nfor requests, and failed to adapt to requests or changes that Samuels perceived as falling outside\n\nof her job duties.   It also listed the following areas for improvement: “Needs substantial\n\nimprovement in developing positive working relationships with co-workers, providers and other\n\ncontract personal. Have received numerous complaints from co-workers, providers and other\n\ncontract personnel regarding lack of helpfulness, negative attitude and unwillingness in help\n\nfinding charts and answering questions.” Despite the areas of improvement noted on the annual\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nreview, Tomlin noted that Samuels had good attendance and Samuels still received a merit\n\nincrease in pay on February 19, 2012.\n\n       On May 16, 2012, Samuels received a final written warning based upon two separate job\n\nperformance issues, both of which arose on April 13, 2012. First, Samuels violated the Time and\n\nAttendance Policy by failing to speak directly to either Tomlin or Malone rather than leaving a\n\nmessage when calling out from work. Samuels acknowledged receipt and understanding of the\n\ntime and attendance policy on April 1, 2010, which expressly notes that she had to speak to the\n\nHSA or DON when calling out from work. Samuels admits that she failed to call out properly by\n\nspeaking to either Tomlin or Malone personally. Second, Samuels failed to notify Tomlin or\n\nMalone of a backlog of Releases of Information (“ROIs”) and failed to create charts for thirty-six\n\nnew inmates. During her deposition, Samuels testified that she did not believe that a backlog\n\nexisted, but acknowledged that some ROIs had not been faxed per policy and also that thirty-six\n\ncharts had not been created. Samuels also testified that, despite an offer to do so, she never\n\nfollowed up with Tomlin or Jones regarding either the attendance policy or the backlogs on ROIs\n\nand charts.\n\n       Following Tomlin’s resignation on August 8, 2012, Malone served dual roles as both the\n\nDON and acting HSA until Corizon could hire Tomlin’s replacement. On October 24, 2012,\n\nMalone received a written complaint from Donna Schwartz, a Registered Nurse, concerning the\n\nbacklog of ROIs in the medical records department. ROIs provide the medical staff with\n\npertinent information related directly to patient care. That same day, Good and Malone spoke\n\nwith Samuels about the complaint and also discussed the backlog of ROIs and Medical\n\nAdministration Records (“MARs”).        At LFCDC, MARs provide a list of all medication\n\nadministered to inmates. In response to their conversation and Malone and Good’s request for a\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nstatement, Samuels submitted another written statement to Good. In her written statement dated\n\nOctober 24, 2012, Samuels stated that the MARs were not included on the job description\n\nprovided to her on March 29, 2012, and that the “extra” duties listed in that job description\n\ncaused her and her co-clerk to get behind on the MARs. Again, to clear up any confusion with\n\ntheir express job duties, both Samuels and Brown were advised that MARs are, and had always\n\nbeen, a part of their job description, and they were directed to resolve the backlog immediately.\n\n       Gary Blair (“Blair”) became the new HSA on October 29, 2012. As part of Blair’s\n\narrival at the LFCDC, he toured the complete facility and met with various staff members.\n\nWhile touring the medical records department, Malone and Blair discovered several boxes\n\ncontaining backlogs of MARs under various tables in the medical records department and took\n\nphotographs to discuss the issue with Samuels and Brown. Blair and Malone met with Samuels\n\non November 16, 2012. Blair mentioned that he was aware there had been issues about Samuels’\n\njob responsibilities and duties; accordingly, he provided Samuels with another clarification to her\n\nprevious job description, again expressly noting Corizon’s performance expectations of its\n\nmedical records clerks. Blair reviewed the job description with Samuels in detail. Similar to\n\nformer HSAs Bowen and Burnside, Blair also provided Samuels with a Development Plan to\n\nhelp address the backlog of MARs, organize ROIs, and improve overall communications with\n\nthe medical staff. As part of the Development Plan, Blair also agreed that he and Malone would\n\nmeet with Samuels on a weekly basis to help address the issues noted in the Development Plan.\n\nSamuels refused to sign the Development Plan.\n\n       On November 26, 2012, Blair and Malone had their first weekly meeting with Samuels to\n\ndiscuss progress on the items listed on the Development Plan, to receive input from Samuels on\n\nways to meet the goals in the Development Plan and to discuss any issues or problems with\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\ncomplying with the Plan. According to Malone’s meeting notes, which Samuels did not deny the\n\naccuracy of during her deposition, Samuels refused to provide any strategy for getting caught up\n\non the MARs backlog. Rather, Samuels insisted on returning to the purportedly changed job\n\ndescription in March 2012, and kept blaming the backlog on those changed duties instead of\n\nworking with Blair and Malone to devise a plan to resolve the backlog.\n\n       Blair eventually had multiple meetings and counseling sessions with Samuels, yielding\n\nno improvement in her job performance. Ultimately, in light of all that had transpired over the\n\npreceding sixteen months, Blair recommended that Samuels’ employment with Corizon be\n\nterminated.   Following review of Blair’s recommendation, Jones agreed, and Samuels was\n\nterminated on December 12, 2012. The EEOC dismissed Samuels’ charge and issued a Right to\n\nSue Notice on June 25, 2012. Samuels initiated her lawsuit against Corizon in the district court\n\non September 21, 2012, prior to her termination.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s order granting summary judgment. Barrett v.\n\nWhirlpool Corp., 556 F.3d 502, 511 (6th Cir. 2009). The moving party is entitled to summary\n\njudgment if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). We view factual evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party’s\n\nfavor. See Henderson v. Walled Lake Consol. Sch., 469 F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 13 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n                                                 III.\n                                                  A.\n\n       In her complaint before the district court, Samuels alleged that she was a victim of\n\ndisparate treatment by Tomlin because of her race. The district court, in granting Corizon’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, addressed the merits of Samuels’ disparate treatment claim,\n\nSamuels, 2014 WL 2506466, at *6-7, but also noted that Samuels, in her response in opposition\n\nto summary judgment, only argued that Corizon “violated the law by retaliating against her.” Id.\n\nat *7 n.3. Accordingly, the district concluded that Samuels had “abandoned or waived any\n\nargument in support of her claims of discrimination on other grounds.” Id. Likewise, on appeal,\n\nSamuels only challenges the district court’s dismissal of her retaliation claim. Accordingly, we,\n\nlike the district court, find that Samuels has abandoned or waived her disparate treatment claim.\n\nSee Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning Cnty. Comm’rs, 85 F.3d 257, 259 (6th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       Title VII prohibits employers from retaliating against employees for opposing practices\n\nmade unlawful by Title VII or for filing a charge of discrimination, testifying, assisting, or\n\nparticipating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Absent direct evidence of retaliation, the McDonnell Douglas burden-\n\nshifting framework governs claims of retaliation based on circumstantial evidence.           See\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973); Imwalle v. Reliance Med. Prods.,\n\nInc., 515 F.3d 531, 544 (6th Cir. 2008). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Samuels\n\nmust demonstrate: (1) that she engaged in a protected activity; (2) that Corizon had knowledge of\n\nher protected conduct; (3) that Corizon took an adverse employment action against her; and (4)\n\nthat there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment\n\naction. See Mickey v. Zeidler Tool & Die Co., 516 F.3d 516, 523 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                             - 14 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       If Samuels offers sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case, the burden of\n\nproduction then shifts to Corizon to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its\n\nemployment action. Id. at 526. The burden of persuasion, however, remains with Samuels at all\n\ntimes. Id. If Corizon articulates such a reason, Samuels must then show that the Corizon’s\n\nstated reason “is merely a pretext for discrimination.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). “A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the proffered reason (1) has no\n\nbasis in fact, (2) did not actually motivate the defendant’s challenged conduct, or (3) was\n\ninsufficient to warrant the challenged conduct.” Id. (quoting Dews v. A.B. Dick Co., 231 F.3d\n\n1016, 1021 (6th Cir. 2000)).\n\n       Samuels posits that she has satisfied the first prong of a prima facie case by having\n\nengaged in two activities protected by Title VII: the filing of her discrimination charge with the\n\nEEOC on December 8, 2011, and the filing of an “internal complaint” with her employer. The\n\ninternal complaint to which Samuels alludes is the written statement she submitted to Good on\n\nOctober 4, 2011, in regard to the September 26, 2011 incident with Mullins and other issues. We\n\ndecline to construe Samuels’ October 4, 2011 statement as an internal complaint and, therefore, a\n\nprotected activity.   Samuels, relying on the Supreme Court’s holding in Crawford v.\n\nMetropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, Tennessee, is correct that an\n\nemployee’s filing of an internal complaint may constitute a protected activity under Title VII.\n\n555 U.S. 271, 277-78 (2009) (“There is . . . no reason to doubt that a person can ‘oppose’ by\n\nresponding to someone else’s question just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and nothing\n\nin the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her\n\nown initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same words when her boss\n\nasks a question.”) Crawford stands for the proposition that Title VII’s “opposition clause”\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nprotects employees who oppose unlawful practices, regardless of whether the employee speaks\n\non his or her own initiative or in response to employer questions.           See Laster v. City of\n\nKalamazoo, 746 F.3d 714, 729-30 (6th Cir. 2014), reh’g denied (Apr. 2, 2014). Samuels’\n\nwritten statement, however, was not in the nature of a complaint.\n\n       We first note that, as Samuels expressly acknowledged in the statement, Samuels\n\nsubmitted the statement at Tomlin’s behest. Both the written statement and the meeting between\n\nTomlin, Samuels, and Mullins that preceded it were specifically intended to give Samuels the\n\nopportunity to explain “her side of the story.” Nothing in the contents of Samuels’ statement,\n\nnor the events that transpired afterwards, suggests that Tomlin took issue with anything Samuels\n\nsaid in her statement.\n\n       More importantly, while Samuels’ statement specifically addressed issues with Mullins,\n\nwhat transpired during the meeting with Tomlin and Mullins, Samuels’ “investigation,” and\n\nSamuels’ general frustration with her coworkers, the statement only vaguely asserts that Samuels\n\nwas “being harassed, discriminated against and [suffered] some retaliation.” Not once does\n\nSamuels suggest in the statement that she was being harassed, discriminated against, or retaliated\n\nagainst based on any protected characteristic, such as her race. If anything, the full context of the\n\nstatement suggests that Samuels was being “harassed” because the complaints were, to her,\n\nanonymous; that she was being “discriminated” against because she felt her superiors were\n\nunfairly crediting the complaints of other employees; and that Samuels was “retaliated” against\n\non account of the memorandum that was sent out the day after she initiated her “investigation”\n\ninto the complaints, although the statement concedes that the memorandum was addressed to all\n\nCorizon employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       Samuels’ statement fails to connect any of these vague references to any protected status,\n\nand never mentions her race. Moreover, when Samuels subsequently met with Good to discuss\n\nher statement, she still did not complain that she felt she was being harassed or discriminated\n\nagainst because of her race. Accordingly, Samuels’ October 4, 2011 statement to Human\n\nResources does not amount to a protected activity. See Willoughby v. Allstate Ins. Co., 104 F.\n\nAppx 528, 531 (6th Cir. 2004); Offutt v. Warren County Reg’l Jail, 109 Fed. Appx. 740, 743 (6th\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam). And insofar as the statement is not a protected activity, it is clear that\n\nthis prong of the prima facie case is not satisfied.\n\n       We turn next to the question of whether Samuels established a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation based on the filing of her EEOC charge on December 8, 2011, which is\n\nunquestionably a protected activity under Title VII. At issue is whether Samuels established the\n\nthree remaining prongs of the prima facie case and, following the steps of the McDonnell-\n\nDouglas analysis, then showed that Corizon’s stated reasons for its employment actions were\n\npretextual.\n\n       Samuels argues that “[t]he [t]rial [c]ourt erred in finding that [she] did not establish the\n\nessential elements of her retaliation claim” and “erred in not finding that [Corizon’s] articulated\n\nreasons for the [a]dverse [e]mployment action were pretextual.”          Samuels’ first argument\n\nmisconstrues the district court’s opinion. We assume that by alluding to the “essential elements”\n\nof her claim, Samuels is actually referring to the prongs of a prima facie retaliation claim. The\n\ndistrict court did not find, however, that Samuels had failed a make out a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation. The district court assumed, but did not decide, that Samuels had established a prima\n\nfacie case:\n\n       Even if the Court were to accept that (1) the written counseling that she received\n       in March 2012, the reduction in the number of hours on her work schedule in May\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n        2012, the implementation of a development plan and scrutiny with respect to her\n        performance under that plan in November 2012, and her termination in December\n        2012 were (2) adverse employment actions with (3) a causal connection to her\n        complaints of discrimination to Corizon’s human resources department in her\n        letter of October 2011 and the EEOC complaint filed in December 2011(4) of\n        which Defendant was aware, Plaintiff has not brought forth evidence to\n        demonstrate that Corizon’s stated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for these\n        actions were pretextual.\n\nSamuels, 2014 WL 2506466, at *8. Accordingly, the district court found that, irrespective of\n\nwhether Samuels could make out a prima facie case, she had failed to establish that Corizon’s\n\nactions were pretextual. The district court also did not fail to draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nSamuels’ favor. We agree that Samuels has likely fulfilled the first two prongs of her prima\n\nfacie case. However, it is less clear that the third prong is fulfilled.\n\n        Samuels’ arguments as to what constitutes the adverse employment actions in this case\n\nhave been something of a moving target. In her response to Corizon’s interrogatories, Samuels\n\nalleged that after filing the written statement with Human Resources, Tomlin retaliated against\n\nher by: clarifying her job description; issuing the lunch directive; and reducing her work hours.\n\nIn her response in opposition to Corizon’s motion for summary judgment, Samuels alleged that\n\nCorizon retaliated against her by reducing her work hours and terminating her “shortly after” she\n\n“excercis[ed] her right to file complaints internally and with the EEOC.” On appeal, Samuels\n\nargues Corizon retaliated against her by terminating her; reducing her work hours; and\n\n“den[ying] [her] the right to discuss her concerns with her co-workers” by “segregat[ing]” her\n\nand Brown “in the medical records office after she discussed the alleged complaints of the staff”\n\nwith Major Hill. All of these arguments, when considered separately or together, are equally\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n        Samuels initially filed her EEOC charge on December 8, 2011. Samuels amended the\n\ncharge on January 26, 2012. The EEOC issued its Right to Sue Notice on June 25, 2012.\n\n                                                 - 18 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nSamuels was not terminated until December 12, 2012. Because Samuels was terminated after\n\nthe EEOC issued its Notice of Right to Sue, the termination is not within the scope of Samuels’\n\nEEOC charge. Further, Samuels failed to amend her complaint to include her termination. As\n\nsuch, Samuels has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and cannot now argue that her\n\ntermination constitutes an adverse employment action. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e); see also Williams\n\nv. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 53 Fed. Appx. 350, 351 (6th Cir. 2002) (exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies is a condition precedent to a Title VII action). Moreover, Tomlin—whom Samuels\n\nrepeatedly identifies as the person who retaliated against her—was no longer employed by\n\nCorizon at the time of Samuels’ termination, and therefore played no role in her termination.\n\nNevertheless, like the district court, we will assume for this analysis that Samuels has established\n\nthe four prongs of the prima facie retaliation case. We hold that Corizon has satisfied its burden\n\nof establishing a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment action. Zeidler, 516 F.3d\n\nat 526. We turn to whether Samuels has satisfied her burden to show that Corizon’s stated\n\nreasons were mere pretext.\n\n       We find that Samuels has failed to bear her burden of production or persuasion in\n\nestablishing that Corizon’s proffered reasons for any adverse employment actions after\n\nDecember 8, 2011, were pretexual.3 Samuels offers no evidence to support her argument that the\n\nreduction in her work hours was for anything other than legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons.\n\nCorizon has presented evidence that, in early March 2012, it began negotiating renewal of its\n\ncontact with the LFCDC. As part of this process, Corizon discovered that the contract only\n\n3\n Because the district court assumed, but did not decide, that Samuels had established a prima\nfacie case of retaliation, the district court considered any activity after October 2011 (when\nSamuels submitted her written statement to Human Resources) to determine whether it could\nconstitute an adverse employment action. Samuels, 2014 WL 2506466, at *8 n.4.\n\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\npermitted the part-time records clerk to work twenty-six hours per week. Samuels, the only\n\nindividual holding this position at the LFCDC, was mistakenly permitted to work thirty hours per\n\nweek instead of the contracted rate of twenty-six hours per week.         Accordingly, Corizon\n\ncontends that it reduced Samuels’ hours from thirty to twenty-six in order to comply with the\n\ncontract. Corizon argues, and Samuels does not dispute, that the reason for the change was\n\ncommunicated to Samuels, and she was instructed by Tomlin and Jones to meet with Tomlin to\n\ndiscuss her new schedule. Because Samuels failed to meet with Tomlin as instructed, Tomlin\n\nsent a letter to Samuels on April 12, 2012, indicating that she scheduled Samuels to work on the\n\ndays that Samuels had been working, but with hours adjusted from thirty to twenty-six per week.\n\n       Accordingly, the only evidence presented establishes that Corizon made a legitimate,\n\nnon-retaliatory business decision to reduce Samuels’ hours based on its contractual obligations.\n\nSamuels offers nothing, other than speculation and her own subjective belief, that Corizon’s\n\n“reason for reducing [her] hours after her complaints is also suspect.” As the district court\n\nfound, such unsupported assertions are insufficient to place the issue of pretext before a jury.\n\nSamuels, 2014 WL 2506466, at *8 (citing McKinley v. Skyline Chili, Inc., 534 F. App’x 461 (6th\n\nCir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment where EEOC’s speculation that employer’s reliance on\n\nperformance problems was “plainly suspect” fell short of demonstrating pretext)).\n\n       Like her claim related to the reduction in hours, Samuels assertion that she and Brown\n\nwere “segregated” in the medical records area because of Samuels’ discussion with Major Hill is\n\nbased on nothing more than speculation and her own subjective belief. To support her allegation\n\nthat the lunch directive “requiring coverage of medical records during lunch operated to separate\n\nthe two (2) African American employees from eating lunch together,” Samuels relies solely on\n\nher subjective belief that “the purpose of the memorandum was clear in that it segregated the two\n\n\n                                             - 20 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n(2) African American employees from each other because of their complaints and because they\n\nquestioned their treatment from Tomlin.” Samuels and Brown, although both African American,\n\nwere also the only two employees who worked in the medical records department. Samuels has\n\nadmitted that she understood the purpose of the directive was to have coverage in the event that\n\nsomeone needed assistance with medical records and, thus, not to penalize Samuels for engaging\n\nin protected activity. Therefore, there is simply no support for Samuels’ belief that requiring\n\nSamuels and her co-clerk to stagger their lunch to provide coverage of the medical records office\n\nduring working hours was pretextual. Moreover, Samuels and Brown, although they could not\n\ntake lunch together, were not “segregated” from each other during the rest of the workday. They\n\nalso remained free to have lunch with other employees at LFCDC.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Samuels has not established any genuine issues of material\n\nfact as to her retaliation claim against Corizon. Samuels’ disparate treatment claim is deemed\n\nabandoned or waived due to Samuels’ failure to raise any arguments regarding this claim either\n\nbefore the district court or on appeal.    Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 21 -\n\f",

This appeal arises from Donna Samuels’\n\n(“Samuels”) suit against her former employer, Corizon, LLC (“Corizon”), formerly known as\n\nCorizon, Inc. and incorrectly identified in this action as Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nSamuels alleges that Corizon discriminated against her in the terms and conditions of her\n\nemployment because of her race and engaged in conduct that was harassing, discriminatory, and\n\nretaliatory, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., and the\n\nKentucky Civil Rights Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. § 344.010 et seq. The district court granted Corizon’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, finding that Samuels’s race discrimination claim failed because\n\nshe had presented no evidence of disparate treatment from similarly situated individuals who are\n\nnot members of her protected class, and that her retaliation claim failed because she had\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\npresented no evidence suggesting that Corizon’s proffered reasons for any adverse employment\n\naction were pretextual. Samuels v. Corr. Med.

Ky. June 3, 2014). Samuels now appeals the district court’s judgment on\n\nher retaliation claim. We AFFIRM.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Corizon contracts with state, county, and municipal agencies to provide medical and\n\ndental services to incarcerated individuals. One facility at which Corizon provides these services\n\nis the Lexington-Fayette County Detention Center (“LFCDC”) in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nCorizon’s employees at the LFCDC include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse\n\npractitioners, physicians, dentists, medical records clerks, and various administrative personnel.\n\nCorizon only staffs two medical records clerks at the LFCDC: one part-time employee, and one\n\nfull-time employee.    Both employees are supervised by the Health Services Administrator\n\n(“HSA”). Another third-party entity, Bluegrass Mental Health—Comprehensive Care (“Comp\n\nCare”), provides mental health services to inmates at LFCDC. Corizon’s medical records staff\n\nmaintains and stores medical records for all inmates at LFCDC, and Corizon is the custodian of\n\nthese records.\n\n       Samuels, an African American, first worked for Corizon as a medical records clerk from\n\nApril 4, 2005 to May 9, 2007, when she voluntarily resigned. Samuels returned to work for\n\nCorizon on November 19, 2007. During this second period of employment, Samuels was hired\n\nas an “as needed” medical records clerk. Samuels eventually became the part-time medical\n\nrecords clerk. During this time period, Samuels worked with one other full-time medical records\n\nclerk, Michelle Brown, and both clerks were under the supervision of the HSA. Brown is also\n\nAfrican American. At the time of Samuels’ rehire, the HSA was Jonathan Bowen.\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n        When Corizon first hired Samuels, she attended the company’s orientation program,\n\nduring which she became familiar with Corizon’s personnel policies and procedures as set out in\n\na manual entitled “Corizon Employee Success Guide” (“Guide”). Each employee receives a\n\ncopy of the Guide at the time of hire and an additional copy each time the Guide is revised.\n\nAccordingly, Samuels, as acknowledged through her signature, received copies of the Guide on\n\nthe date of her rehire, November 19, 2007, and received her latest copy of the Guide on March\n\n30, 2012.\n\n        Upon her rehire, Samuels also received and acknowledged that she read and fully\n\nunderstood the Medical Records Clerk Position Description. This Position Description was one\n\nof many Samuels would receive during the course of her employment with Corizon. According\n\nto the Position Description, her essential functions as a medical records clerk constituted the\n\nfollowing: retrieving medical charts for all health care staff or clinics as requested; filing daily all\n\ncurrently used medical records; ensuring that charts are countersigned by a physician and\n\nchecking charts for completeness; releasing information at the direction of the Medical Records\n\nSupervisor, Medical Director, or HSA; securing all active and inactive medical records;\n\nanswering the telephone, taking messages, and making telephone calls; typing letters, reports,\n\nand memoranda; maintaining a roster or appointment book of scheduled appointments for on-\n\nand off-site appointments; ordering, receiving, and maintaining office supplies; adhering to\n\nsafety and security policies and participating in disaster drills; demonstrating an ability to deal\n\nwith and respond to stressful situations in a stressful environment; and maintaining regular and\n\nreliable attendance.\n\n        Additionally, the Position Description set forth performance expectations for medical\n\nrecords clerks, including, in relevant part: performance of all clerical duties related to the\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nassembling and maintaining of medical records; maintaining accountability for the location of\n\nany medical record on file; taking on direct responsibility to pull records and deliver for clinical\n\nuse; re-filing medical records upon completion of use; pulling records and performing studies as\n\nrequested by the Director of Nursing (“DON”); and completing reports and performing other\n\nduties as assigned by the HSA. Samuels admits that, as a medical records clerk, she was\n\nresponsible for maintaining health records for the sick call, dental, and mental health clinics for\n\nthe entire detention center. Samuels further admits that she was responsible for re-filing records\n\nand organizing the files. Samuels also concedes that her job duties included providing assistance\n\nto staff members in locating charts in the medical records department, and updating and filing\n\nmedical records charts when they were returned from the clinic. Samuels testified, however, that\n\nin practice, health care staff members, rather than medical records clerks, were responsible for\n\nretrieving and signing out their own charts. Additionally, while she admitted to re-filing records,\n\nSamuels testified that she was not directly responsible for pulling records and delivering them for\n\nclinical use, as listed in the performance expectations section of the Position Description.\n\n       Samuels was evaluated on her job performance annually.             On February 27, 2009,\n\nSamuels received an evaluation prepared by Bowen, which gave her an overall rating of “A”1\n\nand listed two areas for improvement: (1) “a need to communicate with administration when\n\nscheduling issues arise,” and (2) “a need to communicate with peers when issues arise.”\n\nApproximately a year later, on March 8, 2010, Samuels received another evaluation from\n\nBowen, which again gave her an overall rating of “A” and listed the same areas of improvement\n\nas her 2009 evaluation.     The evaluation also contained a Developmental Agreement which\n\n1\n According to the evaluation form, a rating of “A” connotes that the employee’s performance\nlevel is that “expected of [a] fully qualified person” and that the employee “[d]emonstrates\nconsistent, competent[, and] solid performance.” There is, therefore, no support for Samuels’\nclaim on appeal that an “A” rating “meant that she fully understood her job duties. . . .”\n                                                -4-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nprovided that Bowen and Samuels agreed to work together for her benefit on the following\n\nareas: (1) “work to communicate issues that arise in sick call before they turn into bigger\n\nproblems”; (2) “maintain clinic environment throughout the day in sick call”; and (3) “work\n\ntogether to find other ways to improve sick call flow.”\n\n       Samuels received another annual job evaluation on March 7, 2011, from the new HSA,\n\nEricka Burnside. Burnside is also African American. Like the prior two years, this evaluation\n\nassigned Samuels an overall rating of “A” and listed the same two areas in need of improvement.\n\nThe evaluation also included a Developmental Agreement, which provided that Burnside and\n\nSamuels would agree to work for Samuels’ benefit in the following areas: (1) “work to\n\ncommunicate issues that arise in the medical records area with administrator ASAP”;\n\n(2) “maintain records and keep the medical records area neat and orderly at all times”; and\n\n(3) “work together with all members of the health care team to help improve upon effective\n\ncommunication and decrease workload.”\n\n       In April 2011, Patricia Tomlin became the new HSA. Beginning in August of 2011,\n\nemployees in other areas of the detention center began submitting written complaints to Tomlin\n\nabout Samuels and Michelle Brown, the other medical records clerk. These complaints largely\n\nconcerned Samuels’ and Brown’s attitudes, communication skills, and general unwillingness to\n\nassist in retrieving medical records. Specifically, on August 2, 2011, Tomlin received an email\n\nfrom Crystal Shadd (“Shadd”), the Director of Comp Care, complaining that when Dana Mullins\n\n(“Mullins”), a case manager with Comp Care, sought help in locating a mislabeled file, Samuels\n\nand Brown were rude and refused to assist Mullins in locating the file. Shadd also noted that she\n\nhad had similar problems with Samuels and Brown in the past. Two days later, on August 4,\n\n2011, Mullins herself e-mailed Corizon to discuss the above-mentioned difficulty with Samuels\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nand Brown, and to report another instance that same day in which Samuels and Brown had\n\nrefused to help her locate a requested file.\n\n       Subsequently, on August 11, 2011, Tomlin received another email from Shadd about an\n\nincident she witnessed between a dentist and both medical records clerks. Shadd reported that\n\nshe observed the dentist ask for a specific chart, and neither Samuels nor her co-clerk assisted\n\nhim in finding the record. Shadd noted that the dentist seemed frustrated with the lack of\n\nassistance, and, ultimately, Shadd volunteered to help him locate the chart. Thereafter, on\n\nAugust 16, 2011, Nicole Marinaro (“Marinaro”), a Corizon phlebotomist, emailed Tomlin\n\ndetailing instances of Samuels’ and Brown’s rudeness and unprofessional behavior when\n\nMarinaro needed assistance with locating charts.\n\n       As a result of these complaints, Tomlin and Levin Jones (“Jones”), Corizon’s Vice\n\nPresident of Operations, who is African American, verbally counselled Samuels on August 18,\n\n2011. Afterward, Tomlin memorialized this discussion in a memorandum to Samuels, indicating\n\nthat Samuels was “expected to treat all staff and departments with dignity and respect” and “to\n\nperform [her] job duties which include retrieving medical records when asked, and in a friendly\n\nand helpful manner.” The memorandum specifically noted that Samuels was “expected to\n\ncomply with [her] job description which [she] read and signed on 11/11/07 [and] which clearly\n\ndefines [her] roll [sic] in retrieving medical records.” Samuels refused to sign the memorandum,\n\nwhich was placed in her personnel file. Jones, however, explained to Samuels that the verbal\n\ncounseling was not disciplinary action, and that the memorandum would be removed from her\n\nfile after six months. Samuels admits that Jones’ explanation was consistent with the Corizon\n\nEmployee Success Guide, and that following her meeting with Tomlin and Jones, she understood\n\nthat she was responsible for retrieving medical records.\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       Nonetheless, on September 29, 2011, Shanna Meyers, a Nurse Practitioner at the facility,\n\nsubmitted a letter of complaint detailing further instances of Samuels’ and Brown’s continued\n\nrudeness and general unprofessional behavior, their failure to assist staff members in locating\n\ncharts, and their failure to follow the proper procedure for thinning medical records. Shortly\n\nthereafter, on October 3, 2011, Corizon received another email from Shadd, forwarding a\n\ncomplaint from Mullins. Specifically, Mullins reported an incident on September 26, 2011,\n\nwhere Samuels responded with negativity when Mullins asked her about a document placed in\n\nthe Comp Care mailbox. Mullins also indicated that the continued negativity from Samuels\n\nmade her loath to ask for assistance in locating charts in the medical records department.\n\n       After receiving these two additional complaints, Tomlin sought the advice of Human\n\nResources Specialist Stephanie Good (“Good”) as to whether these incidents warranted\n\ncorrective disciplinary action against Samuels. Good advised Tomlin to talk to Samuels and get\n\n“her side of the story.”     In accordance with this directive, Samuels was not issued any\n\ndisciplinary action; instead, Tomlin met with Mullins and Samuels together in her office and also\n\ndirected Samuels to provide a statement setting forth “her side of the story.” The day after the\n\nmeeting, on October 4, 2011, Samuels submitted a written statement as directed, via facsimile to\n\nGood, in regard to the September 26, 2011 incident and other issues. According to Samuels’\n\nwritten statement and deposition testimony, Samuels was upset that Tomlin spoke with her in\n\nMullins’ presence about the September 26 incident. Samuels further noted in her statement that\n\nduring the meeting, Tomlin stated “this has got to stop,” that Samuels and Mullins had to work\n\ntogether, that she was “sick of this s—t,” and that maybe Samuels needed to find another job.\n\n       Samuels’ written statement also expressed that she felt harassed and discriminated\n\nagainst based on what were, to her, anonymous complaints. According to Samuels, when she\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nasked Jones during the August 18, 2011 meeting who made the complaints, Jones allegedly only\n\nstated there were a number of complaints and the complaints had come from “jail staff.”\n\nSamuels apparently understood “jail staff” to mean correctional officers. Thus, according to\n\nSamuels’ written statement, on September 28, 2011, she began her “own investigation” into the\n\ncomplaints by talking to Major Hill, “who is over the Medical Department at the jail.” The next\n\nday, on September 29, 2011, a memorandum was distributed to all Corizon employees. The\n\nmemorandum related to safety and security in the jail setting and specifically forbade “[a]ll\n\nCorizon staff” from leaving their assigned medical areas unless directed to do so by the HSA or\n\nthe Director of Nursing. In her written statement, however, Samuels expressed her belief that the\n\nmemorandum was actually directed at Samuels and her co-clerk in medical records as a form of\n\nretaliation because Samuels spoke with Major Hill.\n\n          Good followed up on the concerns Samuels expressed in her written statement. Among\n\nother things, Good directed Tomlin to revise and reissue the memorandum previously distributed\n\nto all Corizon employees to include an explanation to the staff why the memorandum was issued.\n\nGood also verbally counseled Tomlin about her use of profanity during her meeting with\n\nSamuels and Mullins. Tomlin complied with Good’s directive on October 13, 2011, and revised\n\nthe memorandum in regard to staff’s movement in the facility by including an explanation as to\n\nwhy she was issuing the directive.\n\n          On December 8, 2011, Samuels filed an initial charge with the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”), and amended that charge on January 26, 2012. Samuels\n\nalleged discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.2\n\n\n\n2\n    Specifically, Samuels alleged, in relevant part:\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       Meanwhile, the complaints against Samuels and Brown continued into 2012. On March\n\n27, 2012, Kristin Malone (“Malone”), DON, went to the medical records department to request,\n\nfor use by Malone and Tomlin, two copies of an individual’s chart in order to complete an\n\ninternal reporting process. Despite a request by a direct supervisor and the fact that “pulling\n\nrecords and performing studies as requested by the Director of Nursing” is expressly listed as a\n\nperformance expectation in the Position Description for medical records clerks, Samuels refused\n\nto comply. Instead, Samuels stated that she and Brown could not make such copies without\n\nhaving a release, even though a release is not required for Corizon’s internal use of the medical\n\nrecords.\n\n       As a result of this incident, and consistent with the policies in Corizon’s Guide, Samuels\n\nreceived written counseling from Jones and Tomlin on March 29, 2012, for insubordination.\n\nAccording to the memorandum from Jones to Samuels memorializing the meeting, Jones and\n\nTomlin reiterated Samuels’ job responsibilities to her and again expressly noted that Samuels\n\nwas “expected to comply with direct orders from [her] direct supervisor as well as medical\n\nproviders and the director of nursing.” Additionally, during this meeting, Jones and Tomlin\n\nprovided Samuels with further written clarification of her job duties. Samuels refused to read or\n\nsign the memorandum. Samuels admits, however, that she was told to read and become familiar\n\n\n\n       In August 15, 2011 [sic], I was written up by manager Trish Tomlin. I was told\n       that my co workers had complained about me being rude and disrespectful. In\n       September 29, 2011, we all received a letter stating that no Corizon employee is\n       allowed to leave their assigned area or assigned job duties unless you have been\n       directed to do so by the HAS/DON [sic]. I feel this letter was sent directly to me.\n       On October 3, 2011, I sent in a formal complaint about racial discrimination to\n       human resources. This was after my co-worker Donna Mullins [sic] (White)\n       made a complaint about me. I believe that my manager was biased during the\n       investigation since she told me in front of my coworker that she was sick of this\n       shit and maybe I should find me another job. I also believe I am being retaliated\n       against because I feel harassed and no one had responded to my complaint. . . .\n                                              -9-\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nwith the job description because she was expected to perform all duties listed or face further\n\naction, including termination.\n\n       Additionally, on March 28, 2012, Tomlin directed Samuels and Brown that they were to\n\nstagger their lunch breaks and other breaks to ensure that one of them would be available at all\n\ntimes during working hours, 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., to pull charts as requested by the medical\n\nstaff. Samuels refused to read or sign this latest memorandum. Samuels admits, however, that\n\naccess to these medical records was necessary for the health care staff or clinics to provide care\n\nfor inmates residing in the detention center, and that Tomlin and Jones explained that the\n\ndirective was necessary so that someone in medical records could pull these records in the event\n\nthat a medical provider needed a chart or information. Samuels remained free to schedule her\n\nlunch with other Corizon employees working outside of the medical records department.\n\n       Samuels also received a copy of her annual evaluation on March 29, 2012. Tomlin\n\ncompleted the evaluation and ranked Samuels as “substantially missing” a majority of the job\n\ngoals. Samuels’ evaluation noted that she failed to perform tasks outlined in her job description,\n\nfailed to readily perform tasks assigned by her supervisor, did not work well with co-workers and\n\ncontract staff, lacked a professional demeanor such that staff felt uncomfortable approaching her\n\nfor requests, and failed to adapt to requests or changes that Samuels perceived as falling outside\n\nof her job duties.   It also listed the following areas for improvement: “Needs substantial\n\nimprovement in developing positive working relationships with co-workers, providers and other\n\ncontract personal. Have received numerous complaints from co-workers, providers and other\n\ncontract personnel regarding lack of helpfulness, negative attitude and unwillingness in help\n\nfinding charts and answering questions.” Despite the areas of improvement noted on the annual\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nreview, Tomlin noted that Samuels had good attendance and Samuels still received a merit\n\nincrease in pay on February 19, 2012.\n\n       On May 16, 2012, Samuels received a final written warning based upon two separate job\n\nperformance issues, both of which arose on April 13, 2012. First, Samuels violated the Time and\n\nAttendance Policy by failing to speak directly to either Tomlin or Malone rather than leaving a\n\nmessage when calling out from work. Samuels acknowledged receipt and understanding of the\n\ntime and attendance policy on April 1, 2010, which expressly notes that she had to speak to the\n\nHSA or DON when calling out from work. Samuels admits that she failed to call out properly by\n\nspeaking to either Tomlin or Malone personally. Second, Samuels failed to notify Tomlin or\n\nMalone of a backlog of Releases of Information (“ROIs”) and failed to create charts for thirty-six\n\nnew inmates. During her deposition, Samuels testified that she did not believe that a backlog\n\nexisted, but acknowledged that some ROIs had not been faxed per policy and also that thirty-six\n\ncharts had not been created. Samuels also testified that, despite an offer to do so, she never\n\nfollowed up with Tomlin or Jones regarding either the attendance policy or the backlogs on ROIs\n\nand charts.\n\n       Following Tomlin’s resignation on August 8, 2012, Malone served dual roles as both the\n\nDON and acting HSA until Corizon could hire Tomlin’s replacement. On October 24, 2012,\n\nMalone received a written complaint from Donna Schwartz, a Registered Nurse, concerning the\n\nbacklog of ROIs in the medical records department. ROIs provide the medical staff with\n\npertinent information related directly to patient care. That same day, Good and Malone spoke\n\nwith Samuels about the complaint and also discussed the backlog of ROIs and Medical\n\nAdministration Records (“MARs”).        At LFCDC, MARs provide a list of all medication\n\nadministered to inmates. In response to their conversation and Malone and Good’s request for a\n\n\n                                              - 11 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nstatement, Samuels submitted another written statement to Good. In her written statement dated\n\nOctober 24, 2012, Samuels stated that the MARs were not included on the job description\n\nprovided to her on March 29, 2012, and that the “extra” duties listed in that job description\n\ncaused her and her co-clerk to get behind on the MARs. Again, to clear up any confusion with\n\ntheir express job duties, both Samuels and Brown were advised that MARs are, and had always\n\nbeen, a part of their job description, and they were directed to resolve the backlog immediately.\n\n       Gary Blair (“Blair”) became the new HSA on October 29, 2012. As part of Blair’s\n\narrival at the LFCDC, he toured the complete facility and met with various staff members.\n\nWhile touring the medical records department, Malone and Blair discovered several boxes\n\ncontaining backlogs of MARs under various tables in the medical records department and took\n\nphotographs to discuss the issue with Samuels and Brown. Blair and Malone met with Samuels\n\non November 16, 2012. Blair mentioned that he was aware there had been issues about Samuels’\n\njob responsibilities and duties; accordingly, he provided Samuels with another clarification to her\n\nprevious job description, again expressly noting Corizon’s performance expectations of its\n\nmedical records clerks. Blair reviewed the job description with Samuels in detail. Similar to\n\nformer HSAs Bowen and Burnside, Blair also provided Samuels with a Development Plan to\n\nhelp address the backlog of MARs, organize ROIs, and improve overall communications with\n\nthe medical staff. As part of the Development Plan, Blair also agreed that he and Malone would\n\nmeet with Samuels on a weekly basis to help address the issues noted in the Development Plan.\n\nSamuels refused to sign the Development Plan.\n\n       On November 26, 2012, Blair and Malone had their first weekly meeting with Samuels to\n\ndiscuss progress on the items listed on the Development Plan, to receive input from Samuels on\n\nways to meet the goals in the Development Plan and to discuss any issues or problems with\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\ncomplying with the Plan. According to Malone’s meeting notes, which Samuels did not deny the\n\naccuracy of during her deposition, Samuels refused to provide any strategy for getting caught up\n\non the MARs backlog. Rather, Samuels insisted on returning to the purportedly changed job\n\ndescription in March 2012, and kept blaming the backlog on those changed duties instead of\n\nworking with Blair and Malone to devise a plan to resolve the backlog.\n\n       Blair eventually had multiple meetings and counseling sessions with Samuels, yielding\n\nno improvement in her job performance. Ultimately, in light of all that had transpired over the\n\npreceding sixteen months, Blair recommended that Samuels’ employment with Corizon be\n\nterminated.   Following review of Blair’s recommendation, Jones agreed, and Samuels was\n\nterminated on December 12, 2012. The EEOC dismissed Samuels’ charge and issued a Right to\n\nSue Notice on June 25, 2012. Samuels initiated her lawsuit against Corizon in the district court\n\non September 21, 2012, prior to her termination.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s order granting summary judgment.

The\n\ninternal complaint to which Samuels alludes is the written statement she submitted to Good on\n\nOctober 4, 2011, in regard to the September 26, 2011 incident with Mullins and other issues. We\n\ndecline to construe Samuels’ October 4, 2011 statement as an internal complaint and, therefore, a\n\nprotected activity.   Samuels, relying on the Supreme Court’s holding in Crawford v.\n\nMetropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, Tennessee, is correct that an\n\nemployee’s filing of an internal complaint may constitute a protected activity under Title VII.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145915\"><a href=\"/opinion/145915/crawford-v-metropolitan-government-of-nashville-and-davidson-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 277-78 (2009) (“There is . . . no reason to doubt that a person can ‘oppose’ by\n\nresponding to someone else’s question just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and nothing\n\nin the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her\n\nown initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same words when her boss\n\nasks a question.”) Crawford stands for the proposition that Title VII’s “opposition clause”\n\n\n                                              - 15 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v.

Samuels’\n\nwritten statement, however, was not in the nature of a complaint.\n\n       We first note that, as Samuels expressly acknowledged in the statement, Samuels\n\nsubmitted the statement at Tomlin’s behest. Both the written statement and the meeting between\n\nTomlin, Samuels, and Mullins that preceded it were specifically intended to give Samuels the\n\nopportunity to explain “her side of the story.” Nothing in the contents of Samuels’ statement,\n\nnor the events that transpired afterwards, suggests that Tomlin took issue with anything Samuels\n\nsaid in her statement.\n\n       More importantly, while Samuels’ statement specifically addressed issues with Mullins,\n\nwhat transpired during the meeting with Tomlin and Mullins, Samuels’ “investigation,” and\n\nSamuels’ general frustration with her coworkers, the statement only vaguely asserts that Samuels\n\nwas “being harassed, discriminated against and [suffered] some retaliation.” Not once does\n\nSamuels suggest in the statement that she was being harassed, discriminated against, or retaliated\n\nagainst based on any protected characteristic, such as her race. If anything, the full context of the\n\nstatement suggests that Samuels was being “harassed” because the complaints were, to her,\n\nanonymous; that she was being “discriminated” against because she felt her superiors were\n\nunfairly crediting the complaints of other employees; and that Samuels was “retaliated” against\n\non account of the memorandum that was sent out the day after she initiated her “investigation”\n\ninto the complaints, although the statement concedes that the memorandum was addressed to all\n\nCorizon employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n       Samuels’ statement fails to connect any of these vague references to any protected status,\n\nand never mentions her race. Moreover, when Samuels subsequently met with Good to discuss\n\nher statement, she still did not complain that she felt she was being harassed or discriminated\n\nagainst because of her race. Accordingly, Samuels’ October 4, 2011 statement to Human\n\nResources does not amount to a protected activity. See Willoughby v. Allstate Ins. Co., 104 F.\n\nAppx 528, 531 (6th Cir. 2004); Offutt v. Warren County Reg’l Jail, 109 Fed. Appx. 740, 743 (6th\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam). And insofar as the statement is not a protected activity, it is clear that\n\nthis prong of the prima facie case is not satisfied.\n\n       We turn next to the question of whether Samuels established a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation based on the filing of her EEOC charge on December 8, 2011, which is\n\nunquestionably a protected activity under Title VII. At issue is whether Samuels established the\n\nthree remaining prongs of the prima facie case and, following the steps of the McDonnell-\n\nDouglas analysis, then showed that Corizon’s stated reasons for its employment actions were\n\npretextual.\n\n       Samuels argues that “[t]he [t]rial [c]ourt erred in finding that [she] did not establish the\n\nessential elements of her retaliation claim” and “erred in not finding that [Corizon’s] articulated\n\nreasons for the [a]dverse [e]mployment action were pretextual.”          Samuels’ first argument\n\nmisconstrues the district court’s opinion. We assume that by alluding to the “essential elements”\n\nof her claim, Samuels is actually referring to the prongs of a prima facie retaliation claim. The\n\ndistrict court did not find, however, that Samuels had failed a make out a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation. The district court assumed, but did not decide, that Samuels had established a prima\n\nfacie case:\n\n       Even if the Court were to accept that (1) the written counseling that she received\n       in March 2012, the reduction in the number of hours on her work schedule in May\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n        2012, the implementation of a development plan and scrutiny with respect to her\n        performance under that plan in November 2012, and her termination in December\n        2012 were (2) adverse employment actions with (3) a causal connection to her\n        complaints of discrimination to Corizon’s human resources department in her\n        letter of October 2011 and the EEOC complaint filed in December 2011(4) of\n        which Defendant was aware, Plaintiff has not brought forth evidence to\n        demonstrate that Corizon’s stated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for these\n        actions were pretextual.\n\nSamuels, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2506466</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. Accordingly, the district court found that, irrespective of\n\nwhether Samuels could make out a prima facie case, she had failed to establish that Corizon’s\n\nactions were pretextual. The district court also did not fail to draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nSamuels’ favor. We agree that Samuels has likely fulfilled the first two prongs of her prima\n\nfacie case. However, it is less clear that the third prong is fulfilled.\n\n        Samuels’ arguments as to what constitutes the adverse employment actions in this case\n\nhave been something of a moving target. In her response to Corizon’s interrogatories, Samuels\n\nalleged that after filing the written statement with Human Resources, Tomlin retaliated against\n\nher by: clarifying her job description; issuing the lunch directive; and reducing her work hours.\n\nIn her response in opposition to Corizon’s motion for summary judgment, Samuels alleged that\n\nCorizon retaliated against her by reducing her work hours and terminating her “shortly after” she\n\n“excercis[ed] her right to file complaints internally and with the EEOC.” On appeal, Samuels\n\nargues Corizon retaliated against her by terminating her; reducing her work hours; and\n\n“den[ying] [her] the right to discuss her concerns with her co-workers” by “segregat[ing]” her\n\nand Brown “in the medical records office after she discussed the alleged complaints of the staff”\n\nwith Major Hill. All of these arguments, when considered separately or together, are equally\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n        Samuels initially filed her EEOC charge on December 8, 2011. Samuels amended the\n\ncharge on January 26, 2012. The EEOC issued its Right to Sue Notice on June 25, 2012.\n\n                                                 - 18 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\nSamuels was not terminated until December 12, 2012. Because Samuels was terminated after\n\nthe EEOC issued its Notice of Right to Sue, the termination is not within the scope of Samuels’\n\nEEOC charge. Further, Samuels failed to amend her complaint to include her termination. As\n\nsuch, Samuels has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and cannot now argue that her\n\ntermination constitutes an adverse employment action. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e); see also Williams\n\nv. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 53 Fed. Appx. 350, 351 (6th Cir. 2002) (exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies is a condition precedent to a Title VII action). Moreover, Tomlin—whom Samuels\n\nrepeatedly identifies as the person who retaliated against her—was no longer employed by\n\nCorizon at the time of Samuels’ termination, and therefore played no role in her termination.\n\nNevertheless, like the district court, we will assume for this analysis that Samuels has established\n\nthe four prongs of the prima facie retaliation case. We hold that Corizon has satisfied its burden\n\nof establishing a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment action. Zeidler, 516 F.3d\n\nat 526. We turn to whether Samuels has satisfied her burden to show that Corizon’s stated\n\nreasons were mere pretext.\n\n       We find that Samuels has failed to bear her burden of production or persuasion in\n\nestablishing that Corizon’s proffered reasons for any adverse employment actions after\n\nDecember 8, 2011, were pretexual.3 Samuels offers no evidence to support her argument that the\n\nreduction in her work hours was for anything other than legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons.\n\nCorizon has presented evidence that, in early March 2012, it began negotiating renewal of its\n\ncontact with the LFCDC. As part of this process, Corizon discovered that the contract only\n\n3\n Because the district court assumed, but did not decide, that Samuels had established a prima\nfacie case of retaliation, the district court considered any activity after October 2011 (when\nSamuels submitted her written statement to Human Resources) to determine whether it could\nconstitute an adverse employment action. Samuels, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2506466</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 n.4.\n\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\npermitted the part-time records clerk to work twenty-six hours per week. Samuels, the only\n\nindividual holding this position at the LFCDC, was mistakenly permitted to work thirty hours per\n\nweek instead of the contracted rate of twenty-six hours per week.         Accordingly, Corizon\n\ncontends that it reduced Samuels’ hours from thirty to twenty-six in order to comply with the\n\ncontract. Corizon argues, and Samuels does not dispute, that the reason for the change was\n\ncommunicated to Samuels, and she was instructed by Tomlin and Jones to meet with Tomlin to\n\ndiscuss her new schedule. Because Samuels failed to meet with Tomlin as instructed, Tomlin\n\nsent a letter to Samuels on April 12, 2012, indicating that she scheduled Samuels to work on the\n\ndays that Samuels had been working, but with hours adjusted from thirty to twenty-six per week.\n\n       Accordingly, the only evidence presented establishes that Corizon made a legitimate,\n\nnon-retaliatory business decision to reduce Samuels’ hours based on its contractual obligations.\n\nSamuels offers nothing, other than speculation and her own subjective belief, that Corizon’s\n\n“reason for reducing [her] hours after her complaints is also suspect.” As the district court\n\nfound, such unsupported assertions are insufficient to place the issue of pretext before a jury.\n\nSamuels, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2506466</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (citing McKinley v.

To support her allegation\n\nthat the lunch directive “requiring coverage of medical records during lunch operated to separate\n\nthe two (2) African American employees from eating lunch together,” Samuels relies solely on\n\nher subjective belief that “the purpose of the memorandum was clear in that it segregated the two\n\n\n                                             - 20 -\n\fCase No. 14-5807\nSamuels v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n(2) African American employees from each other because of their complaints and because they\n\nquestioned their treatment from Tomlin.” Samuels and Brown, although both African American,\n\nwere also the only two employees who worked in the medical records department. Samuels has\n\nadmitted that she understood the purpose of the directive was to have coverage in the event that\n\nsomeone needed assistance with medical records and, thus, not to penalize Samuels for engaging\n\nin protected activity. Therefore, there is simply no support for Samuels’ belief that requiring\n\nSamuels and her co-clerk to stagger their lunch to provide coverage of the medical records office\n\nduring working hours was pretextual. Moreover, Samuels and Brown, although they could not\n\ntake lunch together, were not “segregated” from each other during the rest of the workday. They\n\nalso remained free to have lunch with other employees at LFCDC.\n\n                                                 IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Samuels has not established any genuine issues of material\n\nfact as to her retaliation claim against Corizon. Samuels’ disparate treatment claim is deemed\n\nabandoned or waived due to Samuels’ failure to raise any arguments regarding this claim either\n\nbefore the district court or on appeal.    Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                             - 21 -\n\f</pre>",
