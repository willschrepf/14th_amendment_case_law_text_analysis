COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                              OPINION\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n  We must decide whether the United States may retain evi-\ndence it seized from Major League Baseball’s drug testing\nadministrator, and enforce an additional subpoena, as part of\nan ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal steroid use by\nprofessional athletes.\n\n                                    I\n\n   These three consolidated cases arise from the federal inves-\ntigation of the Bay Area Lab Cooperative (“Balco”) and its\nalleged distribution of illegal steroids to enhance the perfor-\nmance of professional baseball athletes. The investigation\nbegan in August 2002 and, over the following several years,\nproduced evidence—including grand jury testimony—\nestablishing probable cause to believe that at least 10 major\nleague baseball players received illegal steroids from Balco.\nToday we decide the government’s appeals from the separate\nadverse orders of three different district courts: (1) an order\nby Judge Florence-Marie Cooper in the Central District of\nCalifornia, denying reconsideration of her earlier order requir-\ning the government to return property seized from Compre-\nhensive Drug Testing, Inc. in Long Beach, California (“CDT”),1\n(2) an order by Judge James Mahan in the District of Nevada,\nrequiring the government to return property seized from Quest\nDiagnostics, Inc. in Las Vegas, Nevada (“Quest”),2 and (3) an\norder by Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of Cali-\nfornia, quashing the government’s May 6, 2004, subpoenas to\nCDT and Quest that related to the grand jury sitting in San\nFrancisco, California.\n  1\n    The court also required the government to turn over all notes made by\nagents who reviewed the challenged evidence.\n  2\n    Again, the court required the government to give up all notes made by\nreviewing agents.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                   1085\n                                     A\n\n   As part of its investigation into Balco, the government in\nNovember 2003 served a grand jury subpoena on Major\nLeague Baseball (“MLB”),3 seeking drug testing information\nfor 11 players4 with connections to Balco. One month later,\nMLB responded that it had no such information.\n\n   The government then reasoned that because CDT5 and Quest6\nhad tested urine samples from MLB players during 2003,\nthose entities—rather than MLB—had to possess the samples\nand testing records in question. Therefore, the government\nissued subpoenas both to CDT and to Quest, seeking drug\ntesting information for all MLB players. The subpoenas were\nreturnable on February 5, 2004, but the government extended\nthat date to March 4, 2004, after CDT and Quest promised not\nto destroy or to alter any of the evidence requested.\n\n   Despite protracted negotiations, CDT and Quest resisted\nproducing any of the subpoenaed materials, explaining that\nthey would fight production of even a single drug test all the\n  3\n     “Major League Baseball,” an unincorporated association, consists of\ntwo professional baseball leagues—the National League of Professional\nBaseball Clubs and the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs.\n   4\n     The names of the players are under seal and are not disclosed in this\nopinion.\n   5\n     CDT is a third-party administrator of “drug and alcohol testing pro-\ngrams” that was hired to oversee MLB’s drug use evaluation program. The\ncompany includes “top experts in pharmacology, forensic toxicology,\nlaboratory management, medical review, legal, and administrative\ncompliance.” Comprehensive Drug Testing: About Us, http://\nwww.cdtsolutions.com/about_us.html (last visited June 13, 2007).\n   6\n     Quest offers laboratories that conduct “drugs of abuse testing and ther-\napeutic drug monitoring” with “the most advanced methodologies avail-\nable.” Quest Diagnostics: Diagnostic Testing & Services, http://\nwww.questdiagnostics.com/brand/business/b_bus_lab_index.html             (last\nvisited June 13, 2007). Quest’s laboratory in Las Vegas performed the\ndrug testing on the player specimens at issue in these consolidated appeals.\n\f1086      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nway to the Supreme Court. Following further negotiations, the\ngovernment, believing that a narrower subpoena might be\neffective, issued new subpoenas on March 3, 2004, seeking\ndocuments related only to eleven7 players with Balco connec-\ntions. These new subpoenas were returnable on April 8, 2004.\n\n   Two days before the new return date, the Major League\nBaseball Players’ Association—the union representing ath-\nletes who play for Major League Baseball8 —informed the\ngovernment that it intended to file a motion to quash the sub-\npoenas. The following day, as promised, CDT and the Players\nAssociation filed such a motion in the Northern District of\nCalifornia before United States District Judge Jeffrey White.\n\n                                     B\n\n   After learning of the planned motion to quash, the govern-\nment applied on April 7, 2004, for warrants to search CDT’s\nLong Beach office and Quest’s Las Vegas laboratory. The\ngovernment expected to find testing evidence at both loca-\ntions and knew that the information at CDT would be needed\nto obtain all relevant records from Quest, because Quest\nstored each testing record by code, not name, and CDT pos-\nsessed the information identifying the code(s) that corre-\nsponded to each player in its testing program. Upon a\nshowing of probable cause,9 Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Johnson\nin the Central District of California issued a search warrant\nfor the CDT office,10 and Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leavitt\n  7\n     The government later decided not to seek drug testing evidence related\nto one of the eleven players, and on April 22, 2004, sent a letter to counsel\nfor CDT withdrawing requests for documents related to that player.\n   8\n     The testing records at issue in these cases were created pursuant to a\ncollective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the\nplayers of Major League Baseball (represented by the Major League Base-\nball Players’ Association).\n   9\n     No party disputes the existence of probable cause to support the April\n7, 2004, warrants.\n   10\n      The warrant was not limited to the identifying numbers of the ten\nplayers, although those numbers were integral to obtaining meaningful\ninformation from Quest and thus played a special role in the investigation.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                  1087\nin the District of Nevada issued a search warrant for the Quest\nlaboratory.11 Affidavits submitted to support the warrants\ninformed both magistrates that the information sought was\nalready the subject of grand jury subpoenas and that a motion\nto quash was expected.12 Contrary to the arguments of the\nPlayers Association and CDT, the government did not prem-\nise its April search warrant affidavits on a claim that the evi-\ndence was in danger of being destroyed.13\n\n   The April 7 warrants authorized the seizure of drug testing\nrecords and specimens for ten named Balco-connected play-\ners, as well as “[a]ll manuals, pamphlets, booklets, contracts,\nagreements and any other materials detailing or explaining”\nCDT’s or Quest’s “administration of Major League Baseball’s\ndrug testing program.”14 The warrants also authorized the\nsearch of computer equipment, computer storage devices, and\n  11\n      Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(b) authorizes the government\nto pursue search warrants in different districts. The rule gives a magistrate\njudge the authority “to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or\nproperty located within the district,” “to issue a warrant for a person or\nproperty outside the district if the person or property is located within the\ndistrict when the warrant is issued but might move or be moved outside\nthe district before the warrant is executed,” or “in an investigation of\ndomestic terrorism or international terrorism . . . [to] issue a warrant for\na person or property within or outside that district.” Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(b).\n   12\n      See infra pp. 1109-1110.\n   13\n      Loss of electronic evidence during delays in litigation is a consider-\nable risk. In its recent publication advising judges on how to manage elec-\ntronic discovery in civil cases, the Federal Judicial Center explained that\njudges should consider “preservation order[s]” to “minimize the risk that\nrelevant evidence will be deliberately or inadvertently destroyed” and to\n“help ensure information is retrieved when it is most accessible (i.e.,\nbefore it has been deleted or removed from active online data).” Federal\nJudicial Center, Managing Discovery of Electronic Information: A Pocket\nGuide for Judges 17 (eds. Barbara Rothstein, Ronald J. Hedges & Eliza-\nbeth C. Wiggins) (2007) [hereinafter “Managing Discovery”].\n   14\n      The warrant also expressly authorized the seizure of “correspondence”\nand “e-mails” detailing or explaining Quest’s administration of the drug\ntesting program.\n\f1088    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n—where an on site search would be impracticable—seizure of\neither a copy of all data or the computer equipment itself.\n“[L]aw enforcement personnel trained in searching and seiz-\ning computer data” (designated “computer personnel”) were\nresponsible for choosing the appropriate course of action to\ncapture the electronic data sought. If seizure of all data or\nequipment was necessary, “appropriately trained personnel”\nwould review the data, retaining the evidence authorized by\nthe warrant and designating the remainder for return.\n\n   On the morning of April 8, 2004, Special Agent Jeff\nNovitzky (the lead case agent) and eleven other federal agents\n—including Computer Investigative Specialist Agent Joseph\nAbboud—executed the search warrant for CDT’s Long Beach\noffice. Although CDT personnel were initially cooperative,\none of CDT’s directors—after speaking with counsel—\ninformed Agent Novitzky that CDT would not assist federal\nofficers in locating the evidence they were authorized to seize\nand that the agents should “do what they needed to do.” When\ninformed that agents might be forced to seize all computer\nequipment for up to sixty days, the director again contacted\ncounsel, exclaiming that such a seizure would “shut[ ] the\nbusiness down.”\n\n   Throughout the morning and early afternoon, Agent\nNovitzky spoke several times with CDT’s attorney, David\nBancroft. Bancroft asked Agent Novitzky not to seize any-\nthing while he attempted to work out a beneficial solution\nwith the United States Attorney’s Office in San Francisco.\nLater, Bancroft told the agent that CDT had only one hard-\ncopy document eligible for seizure. Around noon, both Agent\nNovitzky and Assistant United States Attorney Jeff Nedrow\nspoke with Bancroft and CDT’s directors via conference call.\nBancroft emphasized that any help CDT provided should not\nbe construed to constitute consent and then informed Nedrow\nand Agent Novitzky that CDT had two computers on which\nagents would find information relevant to the search warrant.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             1089\n   During this conference call, Agent Novitzky learned that\nagents had discovered a hard-copy document with names and\nidentifying numbers for all MLB players, including some of\nthe ten named Balco players. Agent Novitzky faxed the docu-\nment, which was not the “only document eligible for seizure”\nto which Bancroft had alluded, to Nedrow for preparation of\nanother search warrant to seize specimen samples from Quest\nbased on the identifying numbers. One of CDT’s directors\nbecame visibly upset when she noticed the document being\nfaxed. She left the premises, but when she returned, she\nopened a locked drawer and presented agents with a docu-\nment that contained drug test results for the ten named Balco\nplayers—the document previously described as the only seiz-\nable hard-copy document on site.15\n\n   At 2:35 p.m., a CDT director finally identified a computer\ndirectory containing all of the computer files for CDT’s sports\ndrug testing programs. This directory, labeled “Tracey,” con-\ntained numerous subdirectories and hundreds of files. Seeing\nthis, Agent Abboud recommended copying the entire direc-\ntory for off-site analysis, because of the time and intrusive-\nness involved in searching the voluminous directory on site.\nThe warrant had anticipated that such removal might be nec-\nessary, and provided:\n\n          If the computer equipment and storage devices\n       cannot be searched on-site in a reasonable amount of\n       time, then the computer personnel will determine\n       whether it is practical to copy the data during the\n       execution of the search in a reasonable amount of\n       time without jeopardizing the ability to preserve the\n       data.\n  15\n    Some time later, agents located a billing document for CDT’s off-site\nLong Beach storage locker. Only after agents obtained a fourth warrant\nfrom Magistrate Judge Johnson on April 8, 2004, allowing them to search\nand seize evidence in the locker, did a CDT director agree to open the\nlocker for the agents.\n\f1090      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nThe agents copied the directory and removed the copy for\nlater review at government offices.16\n\n   The search of the CDT facility concluded shortly after 5\np.m., but before he left the premises, Agent Novitzky\nreviewed with CDT directors the evidence seized during the\nsearch. The documents seized included a 25-page master list\nof all MLB players tested during the 2003 season and a 34-\npage list of positive drug test results for eight of the ten\nnamed Balco players, intermingled with positive results for 26\nother players.17 Upon returning to his office in San Jose, Cali-\nfornia, Agent Novitzky briefly reviewed the contents of the\nTracey directory, identifying five subdirectories related to\nMLB. Within these directories, Agent Novitzky identified\nfiles authorized by magistrate judges for seizure, including the\nmaster file of positive drug test results.\n\n   During the time in which Agent Novitzky and others were\nsearching CDT on April 8, 2004, another group of federal\nagents had executed simultaneously a separate search warrant\nat Quest’s laboratory in the District of Nevada. However,\nthese agents were unable to locate the specimens that the war-\nrant authorized them to seize, because the search warrant in\nthe District of Nevada listed the players by name, and the\nQuest specimens were identified only by number.\n\n   Quest employees informed the searching agents in the Dis-\ntrict of Nevada that the records associating the players with\ntheir identifying numbers could be found in files stored by\n   16\n      The warrant also provided for the circumstances in which “computer\npersonnel determine it is not practical to perform an on-site search or\nmake an on-site copy of the data within a reasonable amount of time,” and\nthen allowed “the computer equipment and storage devices [to] be seized\nand transported to an appropriate law enforcement laboratory for review.”\nThe agents did not make use of this procedure, however, because Agent\nAbboud determined that copying the data was possible.\n   17\n      Copies of all seized documents were provided to CDT by the govern-\nment on April 16, 2004.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                   1091\nCDT. Indeed, these records soon were discovered by agents\nat CDT and faxed to the agents at Quest.18 With this informa-\ntion, the agents in the District of Nevada applied for a third\nsearch warrant to seize the relevant items identified by num-\nber as well as by name. Judge Leavitt authorized this third\nwarrant at 6 p.m. on April 8, 2004, and agents seized from\nQuest the then-identifiable Balco players’ specimens later that\nsame night.\n\n                                     C\n\n  On April 26, 2004, the Players Association filed motions\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (hereinafter “Rule 41(g)”)19\nseeking return of the property seized.20\n  18\n    See supra pp. 1089.\n  19\n    Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) reads:\n      Motion To Return Property. A person aggrieved by an unlawful\n      search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property\n      may move for the property’s return. The motion must be filed in\n      the district where the property was seized. The court must receive\n      evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If\n      it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the\n      movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access\n      to the property and its use in later proceedings.\n   20\n      On April 30, the government applied for a fifth search warrant in the\nNorthern District of California, asking for authorization to “seize” all elec-\ntronic data “regarding drug specimens, drug testing, specimen identifica-\ntion numbers, athlete identification numbers, and drug test results, retained\nby [CDT] . . . pertaining to the drug testing of Major League Baseball\nplayers, located within the copy of a CDT computer sub-directory cur-\nrently in the possession of the [Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)] in San\nJose, California, identified as the ‘Tracey’ sub-directory, bearing the fol-\nlowing computer file group names: (1) ‘MAJOR LEAGUE GROUP’ (2)\n‘MLB BILLING’ (3) ‘MLB Drug SubCommittee’ (4) ‘MLB Follow UP’\n(5) ‘MLB IOC.’ ” Because this copy of the Tracey directory was in the\nhands of the IRS in San Jose, in the Northern District of California, the\ngovernment sought the search warrant in that district. See Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 41(g). Magistrate Judge Howard Lloyd approved the warrant. The gov-\nernment did not notify CDT, presumably because the IRS already had in\n\f1092      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   Meanwhile, the government continued to pursue its investi-\ngation. On May 5, using information culled from the Tracey\ndirectory, the government applied for new search warrants to\nseize all specimens and records relating to more than 100 non-\nBalco players who had tested positive for steroids. Magistrate\nJudge Leavitt in the District of Nevada authorized seizure of\nthe specimens from Quest, and Magistrate Judge Rosalyn M.\nChapman in the Central District of California authorized the\nseizure of records from CDT. Again, the government sought\nand obtained each warrant from the district court whose juris-\ndiction encompassed the situs of the property to be searched,\nas directed by Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b).21 The government exe-\ncuted the warrants on May 6, and the Players Association\nimmediately filed motions under Rule 41(g), seeking return of\nthe specimens and records seized.\n\nits possession the copy of the entire directory containing the relevant\nmaterials.\n   The Players Association subsequently filed a Rule 41(g) motion in the\nNorthern District of California seeking return of any property taken pursu-\nant to the April 30 search warrant, and on August 9, 2004, Judge Illston\ngranted this motion. The government did not appeal the order and does not\ndispute it now. Instead, the government asserts that it retains the right to\nreview the Tracey directory based upon the April 7 search warrants, a con-\ntention we address in this consolidated appeal.\n   Insofar as the dissent suggests that the pursuit of the April 30 search\nwarrant evidences bad faith harassment by the government and an attempt\nto evade a possibly adverse order on the motion for return of property filed\nin the Central District of California, we decline to speculate. We have no\nreason to believe that the government sought the April 30 warrant for pur-\nposes of harassment, rather than to avoid an additional search of CDT that\nwould have followed from authorization to seize the original copy in the\nCentral District. Since no district court has ever held an evidentiary hear-\ning, and the government complied with the commands of the criminal\nrules to secure search warrants from the magistrate judges in whose dis-\ntricts the property was located, based upon a showing of probable cause\nthat incriminating evidence would be found, we do not discern sufficient\nindicia of bad faith to support a contrary conclusion.\n   21\n      See supra note 11.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                  1093\n   On August 19, 2004, Judge Mahan ruled from the bench.\nHe granted the Rule 41(g) motion brought by the Players\nAssociation in the District of Nevada and ordered the govern-\nment to return all specimens seized from Quest and all notes\nand memoranda compiled by agents who reviewed the evi-\ndence, other than those pertaining to the ten Balco players\nnamed in the original search warrant.22 He made findings—\nwithout conducting an evidentiary hearing—that “[t]he gov-\nernment callously disregarded the affected players’ constitu-\ntional rights” and that the government unreasonably refused\n“to follow the procedures set forth in United States v. Tamura,\n694 F.2d 591 (9th Cir. 1982),” with regard to the intermingled\nrecords seized in the Central District of California. Almost six\nweeks later, and again without conducting an evidentiary\nhearing, Judge Cooper rejected the government’s suggestion\nthat the documents were seizable under the warrant exception\nthat applies to plain-view evidence of contraband,23 and\ngranted the Players Association’s Rule 41(g) motion in the\nCentral District of California. The order, which also cited the\ngovernment’s failure to follow Tamura’s procedures, man-\ndated return to CDT of any evidence seized that was not con-\nnected to the ten players named in the warrant. Judge Cooper\ndenied the government’s motion for reconsideration of this\norder on February 9, 2005.\n\n  These orders are the subjects of two of the appeals consoli-\ndated here.24\n  22\n      The government moved for a stay of this order because the evidence\nwas otherwise lawfully in its possession pursuant to the subpoena of May\n6, 2004. Judge Mahan denied the motion on November 1, 2004, based on\nthe government’s failure to raise the subpoena argument at the original\nhearing.\n   23\n      We discuss the inapplicability of this warrant exception in Section\nIII.A.4. See infra note 48.\n   24\n      The government returned to CDT and Quest all items mandated for\nreturn under the two district court orders pending resolution of the appeals.\n\f1094      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                    D\n\n   The third appeal concerns grand jury subpoenas issued to\nQuest and CDT on May 6, 2004, which were to be returned\nby June 10, 2004. These subpoenas reached all specimens and\nrecords of positive steroid drug tests for more than 100 MLB\nplayers and were not confined to records pertaining to the ten\nBalco players named in the earlier subpoenas.25 The govern-\nment also sought search warrants for this larger swath of evi-\ndence on the ground that the April 8 seizures did not provide\nall information needed for the investigation.26\n\n   Quest complied with the May 6 subpoena, providing the\ngovernment with hundreds of pages of documents, but the\ngovernment agreed to defer CDT’s compliance pending reso-\nlution of the search warrant litigation. On August 31, 2004,\nhowever, the government revoked the indefinite deferral and\ninstructed CDT to comply with the subpoena by September\n14, 2004. The Players Association filed a motion to quash the\nsubpoenas on September 13, 2004.\n  25\n    These subpoenas were not the first ones issued in the investigation.\nThe first subpoenas, dated January 16, 2004, mandated the provision of all\nMLB drug testing records. On March 3, 2004, the government obtained\nnarrower subpoenas for eleven Balco-connected players.\n   On April 22, 2004, the government sent a letter to CDT withdrawing the\nJanuary 2004 subpoenas. In the same letter, the government reduced the\nMarch 3, 2004, subpoenas to ten, not eleven, Balco players. At the time\nthe government obtained the May 6 subpoenas, the only outstanding sub-\npoenas were those of March 3, which sought the records of ten players\nwith Balco connections.\n   26\n      Recognizing that the documents they seized from CDT pursuant to the\nApril 7 search warrant might not have included all documents relevant to\nthe investigation (even with regard to Balco-related players, see infra note\n46 and accompanying text), and deciding that the positive test results\nuncovered for MLB players beyond the ten with Balco connections could\nbe valuable to the investigation, the government sought a broader warrant\non May 6 in the Central District of California.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1095\n   In December 2004, after hearing argument but without tak-\ning testimony, Judge Illston found that the government’s con-\nduct was unreasonable and constituted harassment. She filed\nan order quashing the subpoenas, which the government\ntimely appealed.\n\n                                    II\n\n   Before we review the orders granting the Rule 41(g)\nmotions in the Central District of California and the District\nof Nevada, we must decide two jurisdictional issues: whether\nthe Players Association has standing to challenge the search\nand seizure of evidence from Quest and whether the govern-\nment timely appealed Judge Cooper’s order to return the\nmaterials seized from CDT in the Central District of California.27\n\n                                    A\n\n   The government contends that the Players Association\nlacks standing to file the Rule 41(g) motion, because it lacked\naccess, control, and ownership over the records and speci-\nmens seized from Quest. Furthermore, it argues that the Play-\ners Association may not base its interest in the property (the\nurine specimens and test results) on the privacy interests of\nthe individual players.28\n  27\n      We need not decide whether the Players Association has standing to\nchallenge the CDT seizures because CDT is a party and has standing on\nits own to seek return of the property seized from its office and storage\nlocker.\n   28\n      The Supreme Court has clearly rejected “vicarious” or “target” stand-\ning to assert Fourth Amendment rights. See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S.\n128, 133-34 (1978) (refusing to extend standing to a party who was not\na “victim” of the search); see also United States v. Taketa, 923 F.2d 665,\n669-70 (9th Cir. 1991) (following Rakas, 439 U.S. at 134, and holding that\na defendant did not have standing to challenge a search of another defen-\ndant’s office). “A person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure\nonly through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search\nof a third person’s premises or property has not had any of his Fourth\n\f1096      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   [1] An association has standing to sue on behalf of its\nmembers when they would otherwise have independent stand-\ning to sue, the interests sought to be protected are germane to\nthe organization’s purpose, and the claim asserted does not\nrequire the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\nPennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 7 n.3 (1988); see also\nHunt v. Wash. Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343\n(1977).\n\n   [2] We are satisfied that the Players Association satisfies\neach prong of this test. First, the Players Association repre-\nsents all MLB players, each one of whom could certainly sue\nin his own right to seek return of his own drug testing records.\nSecond, the interests sought to be protected—the players’ pri-\nvacy interests in their drug testing records—are related to the\norganization’s sole purpose: to represent the interests of MLB\nplayers. Third, the Players Association sought only the return\nof the players’ drug testing information and specimens; for\nthis type of prospective relief, the individual players need not\nbe parties to the action. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n515 (1975) (holding that an association lacked standing where\nit sought damages rather than “a declaration, injunction, or\nsome other form of prospective relief”).\n\n   [3] We therefore conclude that the Players Association has\nstanding to assert the Fourth Amendment rights of its mem-\nbers sufficient to file Rule 41(g) motions seeking return of\nseized property in which their members hold privacy interests.\n\n                                    B\n\n  [4] The Players Association and CDT contend that the gov-\nernment failed to appeal in a timely manner Judge Cooper’s\n\nAmendment rights infringed.” Rakas, 439 U.S. at 134 (emphasis added).\nBecause we are satisfied that the Players Association has met the require-\nments of associational standing, we do not reach its argument that it has\nan ownership interest in the seized items sufficient to establish standing\nin its own right. We leave that question for another day.\n\f             UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1097\norder for the return of property. In order to be timely when the\nUnited States, its officer, or its agency is a party, a notice of\nappeal must be filed “within 60 days after the judgment or\norder appealed from [was] entered.” Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(1)(B).\n\n   Judge Cooper’s order granting the motion for a return of\nproperty was filed on October 1, 2004. On November 19,\n2004, 17 days after receiving notice of the order, the govern-\nment filed a “Motion for Reconsideration and Modification of\nCourt’s October 1, 2004 Order Granting Return of Property,”\nasking the district court to modify the factual descriptions of\nthe government’s conduct. Judge Cooper reviewed this\nmotion on the merits under Central District of California\nLocal Rule 7-18 (governing “Motion[s] for Reconsideration”).29\nConcluding that “the Government identifie[d] no material\nfacts that the Court failed to consider,” she denied the motion\non February 9, 2005. On March 9, 2005, the government filed\na notice of appeal, challenging both the original Rule 41(g)\norder and the denial of the motion for reconsideration.\n\n   [5] We have jurisdiction to review the denial of the motion\nfor reconsideration, because the notice of appeal was filed\nwithin 60 days of that order. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).\nHowever, because the notice of appeal was filed more than\nfive months after the order granting the Rule 41(g) motion,\n  29\n    Central District of California Local Rule 7-18 reads:\n          A motion for reconsideration of the decision on any motion\n       may be made only on the grounds of (a) a material difference in\n       fact or law from that presented to the Court before such decision\n       that in the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have been\n       known to the party moving for reconsideration at the time of such\n       decision, or (b) the emergence of new material facts or a change\n       of law occurring after the time of such decision, or (c) a manifest\n       showing of a failure to consider material facts presented to the\n       Court before such decision. No motion for reconsideration shall\n       in any manner repeat any oral or written argument made in sup-\n       port of or in opposition to the original motion.\n\f1098      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nwe can review that underlying order only if the motion for\nreconsideration tolled the 60-day period to file an appeal.\n\n   [6] Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) sets forth spe-\ncific rules for calculating the time to file an appeal, and per-\nmits tolling for certain motions for reconsideration made\nunder the Federal Rules. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(iv), (vi).\nA motion for reconsideration may be eligible for tolling even\nif it was not filed or considered under the Federal Rules, as\nlong as the motion could have been filed as a motion “to alter\nor amend the judgment under Rule 59” or a motion “for relief\nunder Rule 60 if the motion is filed no later than 10 days after\nthe judgment is entered.” See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(iv), (vi);\nShapiro v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist., 374 F.3d 857,\n863 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that tolling was appropriate\nunder Fed. R. App. P. 4(a), because a motion for partial\nreconsideration that “[did] not state under which rule the\nmotion was brought” could be construed under Rule 59(e));\nsee also United States v. Nutri-cology, Inc., 982 F.2d 394, 397\n(9th Cir. 1992) (“A motion, however labelled [sic], served\nwithin ten days of the entry of an order that could have been\nbrought under Rule 59(e) tolls the time for filing a notice of\nappeal.”).30\n\n   The Players Association and CDT argue that the govern-\nment’s motion cannot be treated as a motion for reconsidera-\ntion for tolling purposes, because it was merely “styled as one\nfor reconsideration,” and only “asked the court to water down\n  30\n     Nutri-cology stated that “motions made under Rule 60(b) do not toll\nthe time for filing a notice of appeal,” but that because the “government’s\nmotion for reconsideration . . . could have been brought under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 59(e) . . . [it] toll[ed] the time for filing a notice of appeal.” 982 F.2d\nat 397. That decision predated a 1998 amendment to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a),\nwhich inserted a provision allowing motions filed under Rule 60(b) to also\ntoll the time to file an appeal, if such motions were filed within 10 days\nof the entry of judgment. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a), advisory committee’s\nnote. The tolling analysis in Nutri-cology now applies to both Rule 59(e)\nand 60(b) motions. See Shapiro, 374 F.3d at 863.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1099\nits findings” without claiming that “the Court failed to evalu-\nate the merits.” We disagree. The government’s motion asked\nJudge Cooper to “reconsider and modify several aspects of\n[her] order which inaccurately characterize[d] the govern-\nment’s actions,” while expressly clarifying that it was “not\nasking for a substantive reconsideration of the Court’s ulti-\nmate return order.” The motion proposed several specific\ndeletions of language in the opinion. These requests constitute\na motion for reconsideration and may be treated under the\nFederal Rules governing such motions. See Am. Ironworks &\nErectors, Inc. v. N. Am. Constr. Corp., 248 F.3d 892, 898-99\n(9th Cir. 2001) (“[A] ‘motion for reconsideration’ is treated\nas a motion to alter or amend judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure Rule 59(e) if it is filed within ten days of\nentry of judgment . . . . Otherwise, it is treated as a Rule 60(b)\nmotion for relief from a judgment or order.” (citing Nutri-\ncology, 982 F.2d at 397)).\n\n   [7] In this case, whether the motion could have been filed\nunder Rule 59(e) or could have been filed under Rule 60(b)\nmakes no difference. Either way, the government’s motion\nfails to satisfy the time requirements for tolling under Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a). To be eligible for tolling, the motion had to have\nbeen filed by October 11, 2005—ten days after the order\ngranting the Rule 41(g) motion. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).\nThe motion was filed forty-nine days after the order, exceed-\ning the time period by thirty-nine days.\n\n  The government seeks an alternative avenue to obtain toll-\ning by arguing that it did not receive notice of the order until\nNovember 2, 2004, and therefore that the time limit should\nnot be calculated from the date of the entry of judgment. We\nagree that delays in notice may offer a basis for filing after the\nnormal deadline, but the Federal Rules expressly state that\nparties must request an extension of time to file an appeal in\nsuch circumstances. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6) (permitting\na district court to reopen the time to file an appeal where a\n\f1100      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nparty did not receive notice);31 see also Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(5) (allowing a district court to extend the time to file an\nappeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause).32\n\n   The government never sought an extension of its time to\nfile a notice of appeal. Instead, in a footnote to its motion for\nreconsideration, the government made the strange request for\n“leave to file this motion for reconsideration” at a point “out-\nside of the normal time frame for the filing such motions.”\nYet the motion was timely under the local rule on motions for\nreconsideration, see C. D. Cal. Local Rule 7-18, as well as\nunder the applicable federal rule, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 60(b).\nNeither the Players Association nor the district court\nresponded to the government’s odd request; they simply\nfocused on the merits of the motion for reconsideration.\nAlthough we are not certain why the government requested\nspecial cognizance of the motion, we imagine that it may have\nfeared that the district court otherwise would dismiss the\nmotion as untimely under Rule 59(e). In any case, the govern-\nment’s request did not constitute a motion for an extension of\ntime to file an appeal, because the narrow and precise request\nasked the court to review the motion for reconsideration with-\nout any mention of a future filing, and never invoked any\nlocal or federal rule allowing time to extend the time to file\nan appeal.33\n   31\n      An extension under this rule may be granted upon a finding that the\nparty did not receive notice of the order sought to be appealed, that the\nparty filed “the motion” within 180 days after the judgment or order or\nwithin 7 days after receiving notice, whichever is earlier, and that no party\nwould be prejudiced. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A)-(C).\n   32\n      A party invoking this rule must move “no later than 30 days after the\ntime prescribed by Rule 4(a) expires” and must show “excusable neglect\nor good cause.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A). An extension under this rule\nmay not exceed “30 days after the prescribed time or 10 days after the date\nwhen the order granting the motion is entered.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(C).\n   33\n      Moreover, even if we were to calculate the time to file a motion for\nreconsideration or a notice of appeal from the date of notice—November\n2, 2004—rather than the date of entry of judgment—October 1, 2004—the\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1101\n   The government seeks to evade the conclusion that its\nnotice of appeal was too late by arguing that the Players Asso-\nciation waived the right to raise a timeliness objection by first\nraising such claim in its petition for rehearing. Basing its\nargument on the Supreme Court’s decision in Eberhart v.\nUnited States, 546 U.S. 12 (2005), and on our decision in\nUnited States v. Sadler, 480 F.3d 932 (9th Cir. 2007), the gov-\nernment argues that the relevant tolling provisions of Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a) are nonjurisdictional and that the Players Associ-\nation forfeited any argument that they were not satisfied.\n\n   In Eberhart, the Supreme Court addressed the question of\nwhat time limitations are jurisdictional. Acknowledging that\nits prior decision in United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220\n(1960), “ha[d] created some confusion because of its observa-\ntion that ‘courts have uniformly held that the taking of an\nappeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdic-\ntional,’ ” the Court distinguished “nonjurisdictional claim-\nprocessing rules” from rules that “deprive federal courts of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.” 546 U.S. at 16. The Court\nexplained that only the former could be forfeited. See id. at 19\n(holding that the “Court of Appeals should . . . have pro-\nceeded to the merits” of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 motion based\n\ngovernment’s motion for reconsideration was filed seven days too late to\ntoll the time to file a notice of appeal under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a). And if\nwe were to read the government’s request as a motion for an extension of\ntime to file an appeal under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), and the court’s Febru-\nary 9, 2005, order denying the motion for reconsideration as an implied\ngrant of such motion for an extension, the government’s notice of appeal\nstill would have been untimely. The government filed its notice of appeal\non March 9, 2005, but Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6) would have allowed an\nextension only until February 23, 2005 (14 days after the order). See id.\nSimilarly, the notice of appeal would have been too late under Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a)(5), which would have allowed an extension only until Febru-\nary 19, 2005 (10 days after the order). See id. at 4(a)(5)(C). Thus, even if\nthe government had requested and received an extension of time under the\nfederal rules, its notice of appeal was filed too late to allow us to review\nthe underlying order granting the Rule 41(g) motion.\n\f1102       UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\non a court-imposed rule, because “where the Government\nfailed to raise a defense of untimeliness until after the District\nCourt had reached the merits, it forfeited that defense”).\n\n   [8] Whether a federal rule establishing a time limitation\nimposes a jurisdictional rule depends on whether the rule\nderives from a statute. See Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443,\n452 (2004) (holding that “statutory provisions . . . contain[-\ning] built-in time constraints” create jurisdictional limits but\nthat jurisdiction is not affected by “Court prescribed ‘rules of\npractice and procedure’ ” (citation omitted)); Sadler, 480 F.3d\nat 937 (“Rules provisions governing timeliness that do not\nimplement congressionally mandated ‘built-in time con-\nstraints’ are therefore properly considered nonjurisdictional\nlimitations, subject to forfeiture.” (quoting Kontrick, 540 U.S.\nat 453).\n\n   In Sadler, we applied this distinction to Fed. R. App. P. 4.\nWe concluded that “the timeliness dictates of Rule 4(b) are\nforfeitable, because Rule 4(b) is a nonjurisdictional claim-\nprocessing rule.” 480 F.3d at 940 (emphasis omitted). We\ncontrasted the mandates of Fed. R. App. P. 4(a): “Congress\nhas specifically limited our jurisdiction to hear civil appeals\nat 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a), which codifies the same time con-\nstraints on the filing of civil appeals (but only civil appeals)\nthat exist in Rule 4(a).” Id. at 937 (footnote omitted).\n\n   [9] The government seeks to benefit from the distinction\nbetween jurisdictional and forfeitable claims under Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4 by arguing that the Rule 41(g) motion should be\ntreated under the criminal rule, Fed. R. App. P. 4(b), because\nthe motion sought a return of property used in a criminal investi-\ngation.34 But our governing caselaw makes clear that a Rule\n   34\n      Undoubtedly, the notice of appeal would have been untimely under\nthe criminal rule absent forfeiture of that claim, for that rule gives the gov-\nernment only 30 days to file an appeal and has no provision for tolling\nduring pendency of motions for reconsideration such as the one at bar. See\nFed. R. App. P. 4(b).\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1103\n41(g) motion is “treated as [a] civil equitable proceeding[ ].”\nRamsden v. United States, 2 F.3d 322, 324 (9th Cir. 1993).\nThe proper rule for considering civil appeals from the disposi-\ntion of a Rule 41(g) motion is thus Fed. R. App. P. 4(a).\n\n   Our dicta in Sadler states that the timing requirements of\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a) are jurisdictional and that claims under\nthat rule are not forfeited. See 480 F.3d at 937. The Supreme\nCourt recently addressed this issue. In Bowles v. Russell, 127\nS.Ct. 2360 (2007), the Court ruled that Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(6), which allows a court to grant a 14-day extension to\nfile an appeal, established a jurisdictional requirement. Id. at\n2366. Explaining that “Congress specifically limited the\namount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-\nof-appeal period in § 2107(c), that limitation is more than a\nsimple ‘claim-processing rule’ ” and therefore the petitioner\ncould not rely on it “to excuse his lack of compliance with the\nstatute’s time limitations.” Id.\n\n   [10] Bowles does not specifically discuss Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(4), the tolling provision relevant here. The government\nargues that “Rule 4(a) does not incorporate a statutory time\nlimit in its provision of tolling for Rule 59(e) or Rule 60\nmotions” and therefore that any failure to comply with the\nrule should be immunized against belated attack. However,\nalthough Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) does not contain language\nfrom 28 U.S.C. § 2107, which lacks a tolling provision, the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Bowles suggests that the same\ncharacterization applies: “Today we make clear that the\ntimely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdic-\ntional requirement.” Id.\n\n   [11] And even if Bowles did not settle the matter with\nrespect to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4),35 we could not consider the\n  35\n    An argument can be made on this score, as the advisory committee’s\nnote to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) reveals that this provision was created by\nthe Court and amended in light of developing caselaw. While the advisory\n\f1104       UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nunderlying order granting the Rule 41(g) motion. In order to\naccept the government’s argument, we would have to grant\nthe jurisdictional benefit of tolling while denying the tolling\nrule’s jurisdictional significance. We cannot defeat logic or\ntext in this manner. If Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) is jurisdictional,\nthe government’s motion does not qualify for tolling because\nit was filed outside the time frame specified in that rule. See\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(iv), (vi) (permitting tolling for such\nmotions only if they are filed within 10 days of entry of judg-\nment).36 If Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) is nonjurisdictional, satis-\nfaction of that provision (or forfeiture of a claim that the\ngovernment failed to satisfy it) would not enable us to ignore\nthe jurisdictional 60-day rule of Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1).37 See\n\ncommittee’s note links Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1) to 28 U.S.C. § 2107, the\nnote contains no statutory link for Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4). And although\nthe notes state that compliance with the rule “places jurisdiction in the\ncourts of appeals,” that use of the word “jurisdiction” is the kind of impre-\ncise terminology clarified in Kontrick that distinguishes between statutory\nand court-based rules. See 540 U.S. at 454 (“Courts, including this Court,\nit is true, have been less than meticulous in this regard; they have more\nthan occasionally used the term ‘jurisdictional’ to describe emphatic time\nprescriptions in rules of court. ‘Jurisdiction,’ the Court has aptly observed,\n‘is a word of many, too many, meanings.’ ” (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens\nfor Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 90 (1998) ).\n   36\n      The district court’s order denying the motion for reconsideration on\nthe merits did not constitute an implicit grant of an extension of time to\nfile within the tolling period, and even if it did, such an extension would\ncarry no weight: even the Supreme Court has “no authority to create equi-\ntable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements.” Bowles, 127 S. Ct. at\n2366.\n   37\n      Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) does not provide exceptions to tolling. Instead,\nthe rule permits tolling based on a limited set of motions—including\nmotions for reconsideration filed within 10 days of entry of judgment. If\nthat provision were nonjurisdictional, the Players Association and CDT\ncould not raise its 10-day limitation as a bar to tolling under it. But neither\ncould the government invoke it as a reason to alter the 60-day time limit\nprovided by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). No other provision of the Federal\nRule would permit tolling for a motion for reconsideration, rendering the\ngovernment’s argument ineffective.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1105\nBowles, Slip Op. at 8. Under either interpretation of Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a)(4), the government’s notice of appeal was\nuntimely as to Judge Cooper’s underlying order granting the\nRule 41(g) motion and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdic-\ntion.38\n\n                                   III\n\n   Having thus disposed of the two preliminary matters of\nstanding and jurisdiction, we turn to the merits of Judge Coo-\nper’s order denying the motion for reconsideration in the Cen-\ntral District of California. We review such orders for an abuse\nof discretion. Smith v. Pac. Prop. & Dev. Corp., 358 F.3d\n1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 2004) (“We review the denial of a\nmotion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.” (citation\nomitted)); see also United States v. Washington, 98 F.3d\n1159, 1163 (9th Cir. 1996) (“This court reviews a district\ncourt’s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discre-\ntion.”). If a district court premises such denial upon a legal\ndetermination, the legal issue must be reviewed de novo.\nSmith, 358 F.3d at 1100 (citations omitted) (“Whether such a\ndenial rests on an inaccurate view of the law and is therefore\nan abuse of discretion requires us to review the underlying\nlegal determination de novo.”); see also Sw. Voter Registra-\ntion Educ. Project v. Shelley, 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir.\n2003) (en banc) (per curiam) (“The district court’s interpreta-\ntion of the underlying legal principles, however, is subject to\nde novo review and a district court abuses its discretion when\nit makes an error of law.”).\n\n   The government confined its motion for reconsideration in\nthis case to factual matters: “While the government respect-\nfully disagrees with the Court’s conclusion that movants are\nentitled to a return of property as a matter of law, the govern-\n  38\n    Because the notice of appeal was timely only as to her denial of the\ngovernment’s motion for reconsideration, we limit our review to that order\nin Part III.\n\f1106    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nment emphasizes that it does not herein request reconsidera-\ntion of the Court’s core order requiring the return of the items\nseized . . . .” Instead, the motion asked the court only to “re-\nconsider and modify several aspects of this order which inac-\ncurately characterize the government’s conduct in this case.”\nThe motion argued that the district court had failed to con-\nsider aspects of the record that would have belied its finding\nthat the government’s behavior was “egregious,” that the\ninvestigating agents failed to comply with the search warrant,\nthat the agents lacked a lawful right to seize the intermingled\ndocuments, and that the government “ ‘blatant[ly] misrepre-\nsent[ed]’ . . . the danger of destruction of records.” The gov-\nernment offered evidence for the district court to consider and\nrequested deletions of findings of misconduct from the order.\n\n   Judge Cooper rejected these proposed modifications. She\nassured the government that she “did not fail to consider the\nexplicit language of the warrant.” She characterized her con-\nclusion that “the agent[s] did not have a lawful right of access\nto the computer records” as a legal determination based on\nTamura, 694 F.2d 591, not a factual one—thereby placing it\noutside the scope of the government’s motion, which by its\nterms was confined to matters of fact. Confirming that she\nhad taken into account the “lengthy history of stalling and\ndelay by [the Players Association and CDT] in connection\nwith the grand jury subpoenas served prior to the govern-\nment’s execution of the search warrant,” Judge Cooper never-\ntheless reiterated her view that the “simultaneous use of\nwarrants and subpoenas was inappropriate given all the cir-\ncumstances.” Finding “no other material facts the Court alleg-\nedly failed to consider,” she stated that “mere disagreement\nwith the Court’s interpretation of the evidence and its opin-\nions about what does and does not constitute acceptable con-\nduct . . . does not justify reconsideration” and denied the\nmotion.\n\n  [12] The question then becomes: what issues fall within the\nscope of our appellate review? We recognize that “[a] district\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1107\ncourt may abuse its discretion if it does not apply the correct\nlaw,” Washington, 98 F.3d at 1163, and that the district\ncourt’s analysis and application of Tamura in its original\norder may well have been in error. See infra Section IV.B.\nHowever, Judge Cooper’s denial of the motion for reconsider-\nation did not “rest[ ] on an inaccurate view of the law.” Wash-\nington, 98 F.3d at 1163. Although Judge Cooper referenced\nTamura and the legal conclusions in her underlying order, she\ndid not premise her denial of the government’s motion for\nreconsideration upon them. She stated clearly that her denial\nwas based upon her review of the record and the factual argu-\nments presented in the motion. While we might not have\nreached the same findings of fact, “[o]ur review is limited and\ndeferential.” Sw. Voter Registration Educ. Project, 344 F.3d\nat 918. We are satisfied that Judge Cooper duly assessed all\nrelevant facts cited in the motion. We cannot discern in her\nrefusal to change the language of the order an abuse of discre-\ntion and thus must affirm the denial of the government’s\nmotion for reconsideration.39\n\n                                    IV\n\n   We turn next to Judge Mahan’s order granting the Players\nAssociation’s Rule 41(g) motion to return property seized\nfrom Quest in the District of Nevada.\n  39\n     It would be inappropriate for us to use the government’s fact-based\nmotion for reconsideration as a vehicle to reconsider interpretations of law\nthat were dispositive only to the underlying order granting the Rule 41(g)\nmotion, even if we believed that errors of law occurred. We have no juris-\ndiction over the order granting the return of property, and decline to dis-\ncuss the treatment of Tamura therein.\n   It is possible that the legal analysis in the order granting Rule 41(g)\nmotion may conflict with our authoritative interpretation of Tamura, as\nexplained in Section IV of this opinion with regard to the appeal from the\nDistrict of Nevada. But we are powerless to reconcile any such discrepan-\ncies, for the government’s notice of appeal grants us jurisdiction only to\nreview the denial of the motion for reconsideration.\n\f1108       UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                    A\n\n   [13] Before considering the merits of that order, we must\nfirst satisfy ourselves that the district court had the necessary\nequitable jurisdiction to consider the motion.40 A district court\nmay exercise equitable jurisdiction to hear such a motion only\nafter analyzing the four factors set out in Ramsden, 2 F.3d\n322. Specifically, the court must consider\n\n       1) whether the Government displayed a callous dis-\n       regard for the constitutional rights of the movant; 2)\n       whether the movant has an individual interest in and\n       need for the property he wants returned; 3) whether\n       the movant would be irreparably injured by denying\n       return of the property; and 4) whether the movant\n       has an adequate remedy at law for the redress of his\n       grievance.\n\nId. at 325. Without explication, Judge Mahan stated in his\norder that each of the four factors weighed in favor of equita-\nble jurisdiction. Because the government now concedes that\nthe parties have no adequate remedy at law, we only need to\ndiscuss the first three Ramsden factors.\n\n                                     1\n\n   In its memorandum supporting the Rule 41(g) motion in the\nDistrict of Nevada, the Players Association argued that the\nseizure of urine specimens and test results constituted “callous\ndisregard” of the MLB players’ privacy interests:\n  40\n    We review a district court’s decision to exercise equitable jurisdiction\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) for abuse of discretion. Ramsden, 2 F.3d at\n324. We review the district court’s interpretation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g)\nde novo. Id. The lawfulness of a search and seizure is also reviewed de\nnovo. United States v. Mendoza-Ortiz, 262 F.3d 882, 885 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(per curiam).\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1109\n       Given the highly sensitive and confidential nature of\n       drug testing samples and records and the information\n       contained therein, and given the exacting measures\n       undertaken by the parties to the [testing agreement]\n       to prevent any disclosure of the players’ test results\n       to anyone, including MLB, the MLBPA, and the\n       players themselves, any seizure of these materials,\n       absent extraordinary justification, constitutes a “cal-\n       lous disregard” for the players’ privacy interests.\n\nWere we to accept this reasoning, any seizure of confidential\nrecords would reveal callous disregard for privacy rights,\neven if such seizure were expressly authorized by a lawful\nsearch warrant.\n\n   The government’s conduct in the District of Nevada does\nnot support a finding of callous disregard. After showing\nprobable cause, the government obtained approval from Mag-\nistrate Judge Leavitt to search and to seize the urine samples\nand drug testing records held at Quest. Although the Players\nAssociation contends that the government had no legal right\nto use the intermingled files taken from CDT to support its\nMay search warrant affidavits, there is an insufficient show-\ning of callous disregard in the government’s use of that evi-\ndence to obtain a warrant, in light of its view that the\ninformation was authorized for seizure under Magistrate\nJudge Johnson’s search warrant protocol.41\n\n   Furthermore, contrary to the assertion of the Players Asso-\nciation, the government agents did not offer “misleading rep-\nresentations” to obtain the search warrant, and the\n  41\n    Because Ramsden requires an assessment of jurisdiction over a Rule\n41(g) motion prior to determining the merits of the motion, we reserve our\ndiscussion of the objective legality of the use of the intermingled evidence\nseized from CDT for our review of the merits of the order granting the\nmotion. See infra Section IV.B. As that discussion reveals, our conclusion\nwith regard to the law accords with our view of jurisdiction.\n\f1110     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ngovernment did not hide the controversy surrounding the sub-\npoena that had been issued for the same property. The affida-\nvit for the search warrant in the District of Nevada advised\nMagistrate Judge Leavitt that CDT and Quest “intend[ed] to\nmove to quash the subpoena.” Later, that language was\ncrossed out and replaced with a handwritten note: “A motion\nto quash has been filed. 4.7.04,” followed by Magistrate\nJudge Leavitt’s initials. The record makes clear that Magis-\ntrate Judge Leavitt was duly advised of the subpoenas and\ntheir status in court. The government’s affidavits do not reveal\ncallous disregard for the players’ privacy interests in the urine\nsamples and other testing evidence held in the District of\nNevada. No doubt these samples and test results implicated\nsensitive privacy interests, but the government was not there-\nfore compelled to stymie its enforcement of the law by declin-\ning to pursue search warrants at all, especially since warrants\nare designed to protect Fourth Amendment privacy interests.\n\n   Not only did the government establish probable cause, but\nthe agents executed the search warrant with due respect for\nthe interests of the MLB players and Quest, the third party\nsearched. The government seized items clearly delineated by\nthe warrant and accepted the assistance of Quest personnel to\navoid taking unrelated items, thus displaying attentiveness\nboth to the warrant’s scope and avoiding unnecessary interfer-\nence with Quest’s business operations. Quest cooperated in\nthe search and declined to join the Players Association’s sub-\nsequent Rule 41(g) motion. We conclude that the first prong\nof the Ramsden analysis weighs against invocation of the dis-\ntrict court’s equitable jurisdiction over the Rule 41(g)\nmotions.\n\n                               2\n\n   As to the second of the four Ramsden factors (the movants’\nindividual interests in the evidence seized), the Players Asso-\nciation argues that its interests in the property mirror those of\nits members. We agree that its members possess strong pri-\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1111\nvacy interests in both their drug test results and the actual\nspecimens. See Roe v. Sherry, 91 F.3d 1270, 1274 (9th Cir.\n1996) (recognizing an individual’s “strong interest in protect-\ning the confidentiality of [one’s] HIV status”). Because the\nPlayers Association exists to represent such interests, Judge\nMahan properly found that this factor weighed in favor of\nequitable jurisdiction.\n\n                               3\n\n   Judge Mahan also found satisfied the third Ramsden factor\n(likelihood of irreparable injury if the evidence were not\nreturned). As the Players Association notes, the public release\nof positive drug testing evidence could irreparably damage the\ncareers of the affected players, even if the positive results\nwere not actually caused by illegal steroid use. Based on this\ndanger, we agree that the third factor also weighs in favor of\nequitable jurisdiction.\n\n                               4\n\n   [14] Although we conclude that the district court erred in\nfinding callous disregard of Fourth Amendment rights, the\nthree other equitable jurisdiction factors weigh in favor of\nhearing the motions by the Players Association. See Ramsden,\n2 F.3d at 326 (holding that where three of the four factors\nfavored an exercise of equitable jurisdiction, the court had\npower to hear a Rule 41(g) motion). As such, we cannot say\nthat Judge Mahan’s initial choice to hear the motion consti-\ntuted an abuse of discretion.\n\n                               B\n\n   We turn now to the merits of Judge Mahan’s substantive\nruling requiring the return of property seized in the District of\nNevada that did not relate solely to the ten players named in\nthe April 7 search warrants.\n\f1112     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                  1\n\n   [15] With respect to property taken during the execution of\nsearch warrants, Rule 41(g) provides that a person “aggrieved\nby an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the depri-\nvation of property may move for the property’s return.” When\nsuch a motion is granted, the property in question must be\nreturned to the moving party, but a court “may impose reason-\nable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in\nlater proceedings.” Id. Although the rule itself does not set a\nstandard for determining when property should be returned to\na moving party, an advisory committee’s note explains that\n“reasonableness under all of the circumstances must be the\ntest.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), advisory committee’s note.42\n\n   The Players Association argues that the seizure of property\nfrom Quest in the District of Nevada was unreasonable. The\nPlayers Association offers no argument that the search of\nQuest exceeded the terms of the search warrant or was exe-\ncuted in an unconstitutional manner. Instead, the Players\nAssociation argues that the search warrant lacked a legal\nfoundation because the government’s affidavits used inter-\nmingled files seized at CDT to name individuals other than\nthe ten players previously identified. The Players Association\ncontends that these files were illegally seized and that “the\ngovernment . . . [is forbidden] from disseminating or using the\nfruits of an illegal search.” Under the doctrine of the “fruit of\nthe poisonous tree,” evidence may not be used if “ ‘granting\nestablishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which\ninstant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of\nthat illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable\nto be purged of the primary taint.’ ” Wong Sun v. United\nStates, 371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963) (citation omitted).\n  42\n    The Supreme Court previously has cited an advisory committee’s note\nto illuminate the meaning of a federal rule. See Huddleson v. United\nStates, 485 U.S. 681, 688 (1988) (interpreting Fed. R. Evid. 404(b));\nUnited States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554, 555 (1988).\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1113\n   The district court agreed with this fruit-of-the-poisonous-\ntree reasoning, expressly premising its order to return prop-\nerty seized in the District of Nevada on the illegality of the\nseizures in the Central District of California:\n\n        Under the particular circumstances of this case, it\n     was unreasonable for the Government to refuse to\n     follow the procedures set forth in United States v.\n     Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (9th Cir. 1982), upon learning\n     that drug-testing records for the ten athletes named\n     in the original April 8 warrants executed at Quest\n     and at Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (“CDT”)\n     were intermingled with records for other athletes not\n     named in those warrants.\n\n                                     2\n\n   [16] We review the district court’s legal analysis de novo.\nMendoza-Ortiz, 262 F.3d at 885. Like Judge Mahan, we look\nto the seizure of intermingled data in the Central District of\nCalifornia in order to determine whether that information pro-\nvided a valid foundation for the warrants in the District of\nNevada.43 See United States v. Bishop, 264 F.3d 919, 924 (9th\nCir. 2001) (“Once the district court determined that the search\nwarrant included illegally obtained information, it properly\npurged the affidavit of the offending facts and examined\nwhether the remaining facts still afforded a substantial basis\n   43\n      Although the search and seizures at CDT occurred in a different dis-\ntrict, Judge Mahan properly considered them, because they played a neces-\nsary and dispositive role in the authorization of the seizures at Quest.\nJudge Mahan evaluated the legality of those seizures before Judge Cooper\nruled on them in the Central District of California, and did not premise his\ndecision on the view that he was bound by a previous decision. If any-\nthing, the litigation in the Central District suggested the opposite: Magis-\ntrate Judge Johnson had recommended that the Rule 41(g) motion filed by\nthe Players Association and CDT should be denied. Only later did Judge\nCooper reject that recommendation and grant the Rule 41(g) motion,\nordering the property to be returned to CDT.\n\f1114    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nfor concluding that the search warrant was supported by prob-\nable cause.”).\n\n   This court has addressed previously whether the govern-\nment may seize units containing information authorized for\nseizure intermingled with information not described in the\nsearch warrant. In United States v. Beusch, 596 F.2d 871 (9th\nCir. 1979), we dealt with a motion to suppress evidence con-\nsisting of hard-copy ledgers containing items covered by the\nsearch warrant intermingled with items not covered by the\nsearch warrant. Id. at 876-77. We concluded that no Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred when agents seized “single\nfiles and single ledgers, i.e., single items which, though theo-\nretically separable, in fact constitute one volume or file fold-\ner.” Id. at 877. We constrained our ruling by stating that “the\nreasons we have given for allowing [such] seizure may not\napply to sets of ledgers or files, but because that is not the\ncase here, we find it unnecessary to discuss it further.” Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n   [17] Three years later, in Tamura, 694 F.2d 591, we consid-\nered whether the government could seize a set of hard-copy\nfiles including target data as well as information not specified\nin the search warrant. In that case, officers executed a search\nwarrant for three specified categories of records stored at a\nLos Angeles office. Id. at 594. Agents seized—without any\nlimiting effort—files that were not specified in the search\nwarrant. Id. at 595. We condemned such “wholesale seizure\nfor later detailed examination of records not described in a\nwarrant.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Holding that the Fourth\nAmendment barred the conversion of a specific warrant into\na general one, we described two methods by which the gov-\nernment could avoid such constitutional violations.\n\n   First, if the government anticipated that on-site segregation\nof target documents would not be feasible in a reasonable\namount of time, it can seek a preordained warrant protocol\nallowing the seizure of such intermingled documents. This\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            1115\napproach would ensure proper judicial oversight of any sei-\nzures.\n\n       If the need for transporting the documents is known\n       to the officers prior to the search, they may apply for\n       specific authorization for large-scale removal of\n       material, which should be granted by the magistrate\n       issuing the warrant only where on-site sorting is\n       infeasible and no other practical alternative exists.\n       See United States v. Hillyard, 677 F.2d 1336, 1340\n       (9th Cir. 1982). The essential safeguard required is\n       that wholesale removal must be monitored by the\n       judgment of a neutral, detached magistrate.\n\nTamura, 694 F.2d at 596. Specific authorization to make such\nseizures depends on detailed information in the government’s\nsearch warrant affidavits, which should describe “the relevant\ntechnological issues,” Managing Discovery, supra note 13, at\n21, and the feasibility of parsing the anticipated storage\nmedia. With such information, a magistrate can set forth\nguidelines that ensure the government does not seize inter-\nmingled data without judicial oversight. If a warrant includes\nsuch protocol, and the government abides by it, post-search\nreview is not necessary.44\n\n   Second, if the government obtained a search warrant with-\nout a preordained protocol for removing intermingled target\nand non-target data, but encountered an unanticipated need to\nseize units containing intermingled data, agents could seize\nthat unit and seal it pending post-search review. Only if\nauthorized by the “judgment of a neutral, detached magis-\ntrate” could it keep the seized items. Like the use of a pre-\nsearch protocol, this second method of post-search authoriza-\ntion would ensure judicial oversight in cases where on-site\nsegregation of intermingled data cannot feasibly occur.\n  44\n   In other words, a Fourth Amendment violation could still occur if the\ngovernment did not comply with the warrant protocol, or if the warrant\nwas issued without probable cause.\n\f1116      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   [18] In the comparatively rare instances where documents\nare so intermingled that they cannot feasibly be sorted on site,\nwe suggest that the Government and law enforcement offi-\ncials generally can avoid violating fourth amendment rights\nby sealing and holding the documents pending approval by a\nmagistrate of a further search, in accordance with the proce-\ndures set forth in the American Law Institute’s Model Code\nof Pre-Arraignment Procedure.45\n  45\n      The Tamura court pointed to the American Law Institute’s Model\nCode of Pre-Arraignment Procedure as a guide that would help agents\navoid constitutional violations in situations where intermingled documents\nneeded to be seized but where the search warrant lacked a protocol for\nsuch seizures. 694 F.2d at 595-96. The Tamura court found that the agents\nhad violated Fourth Amendment rights by making a “wholesale seizure,”\nrendering the post-search alternative approach to be advisory dicta. See id.\nat 595; see also United States v. Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1090 (C.D.\nCal. 2004) (noting that after the Tamura court “held that the government’s\nwholesale seizure of company documents was illegal because the agents\nintentionally seized materials they knew were not covered by the warrant\n. . . the Tamura court suggested, albeit in dicta, that [for such seizure of\nall records] a warrant would be appropriate” (emphasis added)).\n   It is true that Tamura’s two methods of a pre-search protocol or post-\nsearch review were advised in dicta and represented pragmatic approaches\nrather than constitutional rules. We recognize that some courts in other cir-\ncuits have questioned the procedures advised in Tamura. One district court\nin Michigan explained: “The Court declines to follow Tamura, at least in\nthis case, because Tamura did not involve computer files and therefore did\nnot consider the specific problems associated with conducting a search for\ncomputerized records.” United States v. Scott-Emuakpor, 2000 WL\n288443, at *8 (W.D. Mich.). Although declining to apply Tamura’s prag-\nmatic approach to computer searches, Judge Quist stated: “This is not to\nsuggest that seizure of all computer disks is permissible whenever the war-\nrant authorizes the seizure of computer records.” Id. Another court, also\nreferencing Tamura, noted that in the modern computer context a “ ‘sug-\ngestion’ by a panel of the Ninth Circuit in a 20-plus year old case is not\npersuasive.” United States v. Kaufman, 2005 WL 2304345, at *4 n.3 (D.\nKan).\n   Like these district courts from other circuits, we recognize that the com-\nputer era adds new complexity to the test of reasonableness under the\nFourth Amendment. Precisely for this reason, we view Tamura as espe-\ncially significant in the computer context.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1117\nTamura, 694 F.2d at 595-96 (footnote omitted).\n\n   Recently, we applied Tamura to uphold seizures of inter-\nmingled documents in the computer context. In United States\nv. Adjani, 452 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2006), investigating agents\nobtained a search warrant to seize evidence of the defendant\nAdjani’s extortion activities. Id. at 1142. The search warrant\ncontained a detailed protocol for the seizure of intermingled\nevidence. Id. at 1149 (“The Adjani warrant ‘describe[d] in\ngreat[ ] detail the items one commonly expects to find on\npremises used for the criminal activities in question . . . .’ ”\n(alterations in original)). In executing the warrant, agents\nseized Adjani’s computer as well as the computer of a woman\nliving with him, who was not identified as a suspect in the\nwarrant. Id. The computers were subsequently searched at an\nFBI computer lab, and evidence they contained was used to\ncharge both Adjani and his housemate. In a motion to sup-\npress the evidence, the two defendants argued that the\nwoman’s computer was not seizable under the search warrant,\nand if it were, that the search warrant was overbroad. We\nrejected both claims, citing the difficulty of segregating elec-\ntronic data:\n\n    We understand the heightened specificity concerns\n    in the computer context, given the vast amount of\n    data they can store. As the defendants urge, the war-\n    rant arguably might have provided for a “less inva-\n    sive search . . . .” Avoiding that kind of specificity\n    and limitation was not unreasonable under the cir-\n    cumstances here, however. To require such a pin-\n    pointed computer search, restricting the search to an\n    email program or to specific search terms, would\n    likely have failed to cast a sufficiently wide net to\n    capture the evidence sought. Cf. [United States v.]\n    Ross, 456 U.S. [798,] 821 [1982] (“When a legiti-\n    mate search is under way, and when its purpose and\n    its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinc-\n    tions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the\n\f1118     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    case of a home, or between glove compartments,\n    upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in\n    the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest\n    in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at\n    hand.”).\n\nId. at 1149-50 (parallel citation omitted). Reiterating what we\nset forth in Tamura, we approvingly noted that the warrant\nincorporated a specific protocol:\n\n    The supporting affidavit attached to the warrant set\n    forth a detailed computer search protocol, including\n    instructions as to when the computers should be\n    searched on-site rather than taken off-site and proce-\n    dures for screening the data to determine what data\n    could be searched and seized under the terms of the\n    warrant. See also U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Searching\n    and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic\n    Evidence in Criminal Investigations 43, 69 (July\n    2002) (detailing what FBI agents should include in\n    warrants when they contemplate the need to search\n    computers). Such specificity increases our confi-\n    dence that the magistrate judge was well aware of\n    what he was authorizing and that the agents knew\n    the bounds of their authority in executing the search.\n    Cf. [United States v.] Hay, 231 F.3d [630,] 636 [(9th\n    Cir. 2000)] (considering favorably an affidavit pro-\n    viding “that searches and seizures of evidence from\n    computers requires agents to seize all parts of a com-\n    puter system to be processed later by a qualified\n    computer expert.”).\n\nId. at 1149 n.7. “The contours of [the Fourth Amendment’s]\nprotections in the context of computer searches pose difficult\nquestions,” we explained. Id. at 1152. “Computers are simul-\ntaneously file cabinets (with millions of files) and locked desk\ndrawers; they can be repositories of innocent and deeply per-\nsonal information, but also of evidence of crimes. . . . As soci-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            1119\nety grows ever more reliant on computers . . . courts will be\ncalled upon to analyze novel legal issues and develop new\nrules within our well established Fourth Amendment jurispru-\ndence.” Id. Attuned to the needs of law enforcement as well\nas privacy, we upheld the validity of the search warrant and\nrejected the argument that items of evidence fell “outside the\nscope of the warrant because they implicated [a person not\nnamed in the warrant] in the crime and supported a charge of\nconspiracy to commit extortion [against her].” Id. at 1151.\n\n   In 2006, we confirmed the validity of this analysis in\nUnited States v. Hill, 459 F.3d 966 (9th Cir.), where we\naddressed a motion to suppress evidence. The defendant\nargued that the warrant was overbroad because it allowed the\nseizure of computer and storage media related to child por-\nnography without requiring the government to conduct an on-\nsite search and without providing a protocol. Id. at 973-78.\nCiting Tamura and Adjani, we explained that on-site review\nwas not always required. Id. at 975-76. We emphasized the\n“serious risk that the police might damage the storage\nmedium or compromise the integrity of the evidence by\nattempting to access the data at the scene” and the disruption\ncaused by attempts to segregate complex electronic data on-\nsite:\n\n    [T]he process of searching the files at the scene can\n    take a long time. To be certain that the medium in\n    question does not contain any seizable material, the\n    officers would have to examine every one of what\n    may be thousands of files on a disk—a process that\n    could take many hours and perhaps days. Taking that\n    much time to conduct the search would not only\n    impose a significant and unjustified burden on police\n    resources, it would also make the search more intru-\n    sive. . . . If the search took hours or days, the intru-\n    sion would continue for that entire period,\n    compromising the Fourth Amendment value of mak-\n\f1120     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    ing police searches as brief and non-intrusive as pos-\n    sible.\n\nId. at 974-75. In light of these concerns, we concluded that it\nwas “reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for the police\nto take all of [the defendant’s] computer storage media from\nhis home (they did not find his computer) so they could con-\nduct their search offsite in a police laboratory, rather than car-\nrying out the search onsite and taking only whatever evidence\nof [targeted material] they might find.” Id. at 968. “[T]he war-\nrant was not fatally defective in failing to require an onsite\nsearch and isolation of child pornography before removing\nstorage media wholesale.” Id. at 975.\n\n   [19] We then addressed whether the warrant was invalid\nbecause it lacked a specific protocol for seizures of electronic\ndata. Although we made clear that a specific protocol was not\nmandatory, we stated that a “warrant[ ] authorizing blanket\nremoval of all computer storage media for later examination,”\nmust be premised upon an “affidavit giving a reasonable\nexplanation . . . why a wholesale seizure is necessary.” Id. at\n976 (citing Tamura, 694 F.2d at 595). “A warrant describing\na category of items is not invalid if a more specific descrip-\ntion is impossible,” id. at 973, as long as the affidavit explains\nwhy “the officers could not reasonably describe the objects of\ntheir search with more specificity,” id. at 976.\n\n   The agents in Hill offered neither a detailed description of\nthe items to be seized nor any explanation of why a specific\ndescription was impossible. “Accordingly, we h[e]ld that the\nwarrant here was overbroad in authorizing a blanket seizure\nin the absence of an explanatory supporting affidavit, which\nwould have documented the informed endorsement of the\nneutral magistrate.” Id. at 976-77 (citing Tamura, 694 F.2d\n596). At the same time, we held that “the search here was sup-\nported by probable cause and, notwithstanding the shortcom-\nings of the search warrant affidavit, the manner of its\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1121\nexecution d[id] not mandate suppression of the fruits of that\nsearch.” Id. at 979 (emphasis added).\n\n                              3\n\n   [20] We now apply these precedents to determine whether\nthe seizures at CDT were unlawful. The problems of intru-\nsiveness that we recognized in Hill are all the more apparent\nhere because the search was conducted on the premises of a\nthird party business. In this case, the government obtained\nadvance authorization to seize intermingled documents based\nupon a search warrant protocol that had been carefully out-\nlined and supported. The government’s affidavits were prem-\nised on the advice of computer specialists, who anticipated\nthat certain intermingled evidence might be difficult to sepa-\nrate on-site:\n\n    Upon searching the premises, law enforcement per-\n    sonnel trained in searching and seizing computer\n    data (the “computer personnel”) will make an initial\n    review of any computer equipment and storage\n    devices to determine whether these items can be\n    searched on-site in a reasonable amount of time and\n    without jeopardizing the ability to preserve the data.\n    ...\n\n    If the computer personnel determine that it is not\n    practical to perform an on-site search or make an on-\n    site copy of the data within a reasonable amount of\n    time, then the computer equipment and storage\n    devices will be seized and transported to an appro-\n    priate law enforcement laboratory for review.\n\nAs we explained in Hill, the affidavits did not require pre-\nscience but they must contain a candid recitation of the avail-\nable information.\n\n    Without such individualized justification being pres-\n    ented to the magistrate, we cannot be sure that the\n\f1122     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    judge was aware of the officers’ intent and the tech-\n    nological limitations meriting the indiscriminate\n    seizure—and thus was intelligently able to exercise\n    the court’s oversight function. An explanatory state-\n    ment in the affidavit also assures us that the officers\n    could not reasonably describe the objects of their\n    search with more specificity.\n\n459 F.3d at 976. In this case, unlike in Hill, the government\nsubmitted detailed affidavits describing the anticipated diffi-\nculties of sorting computer data on-site. The affidavits pro-\nposed a protocol to guide and to limit the seizures of\nintermingled evidence, which Magistrate Judge Johnson\napproved.\n\n   Furthermore, the record reveals that the government com-\nplied with the protocol in the warrant. Agent Abboud, a com-\nputer analyst, determined that on-site review would not be\nfeasible in a reasonable amount of time. The agents then cop-\nied several intermingled documents, including the Tracey\ndirectory. They did not seize the actual computer, although\nthe search warrant authorized full seizure of the hardware if\ncomputer analysts determined that neither on-site searching\nnor copying were feasible. The government thereby enabled\nCDT to continue its business operations.\n\n   Although the Players Association contends that the govern-\nment behaved unreasonably by copying the entire Tracey\ndirectory, an analysis of the difficulty of segregating intermin-\ngled electronic data reveals the opposite. The Federal Judicial\nCenter recently explained:\n\n    [S]ome computer-based transactions do not result in\n    a conventional document, but instead are represented\n    in integrated databases. Even less-complex ESI\n    [electronically stored information] may be incompre-\n    hensible and unusable when separated from the sys-\n    tem that created it. For example, a spreadsheet\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                    1123\n       produced in portable document format (PDF) may be\n       useless because embedded information, such as com-\n       putational formulas, cannot be seen or discerned.\n       Finally, deleting an electronic document does not get\n       rid of it, as shredding a paper document would. An\n       electronic document may be recovered from the hard\n       drive, to the extent it has not been overwritten . . . .\n\n          These differences between ESI and conventional\n       information have implications for discovery. For\n       example, the dynamic nature of ESI makes it vital\n       that a data producer institute “litigation holds” to\n       preserve information that may be discoverable, often\n       even before the lawsuit is filed. Moreover, the vol-\n       ume and multiple sources of ESI may lead to dis-\n       putes about the scope of discovery and may make\n       review to identify and segregate privileged informa-\n       tion more difficult . . . .\n\nManaging Discovery, supra note 13, at 3-4.46 At the risk of\nlosing data, the government ensured that CDT could continue\nits business activities, thus evidencing the reasonableness and\nrestraint conspicuously absent in the “wholesale seizure” con-\nducted by the agents in Tamura.47\n  46\n      Agent Novitsky expressed the government’s awareness of these risks\nin his May search warrant affidavits: “IRS Special Agent Jeff Jack, a\nComputer Investigative Specialist with the IRS, . . . gave me specific\nexamples of deleted files or temporary files created when printing a file\nthat cannot be[ ] seen or retrieved from a simple copy of a computer sub-\ndirectory, but may be retrievable using forensic tools, if allowed to exam-\nine the entire computer system.”\n   47\n      Increasingly, courts have recognized the danger of losing electronic\ninformation or obtaining only incomplete data. See Adjani, 452 F.3d 1140;\nHill, 459 F.3d 966; see also Scott-Emuakpor, 2000 WL 288443, at *8\n(“[T]he agents were not confined to searching the files on the hard drive\nand disks but could also lawfully search for deleted material . . . [;] the sei-\nzure of [items other than hard drives and disks] was reasonable because\nit allowed the agents to preserve the computer system as it existed for the\ncomputer analysts . . . without taking the risk of losing any files.”).\n\f1124     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   Although the seizure of intermingled evidence was permit-\nted under the warrant protocol, the Players Association argues\nthat the government violated the search warrant’s protocol by\nallowing Agent Novitzky to open and to view the contents of\nthe Tracey directory, rather than leaving Agent Abboud to\nsearch alone. Under this view, only Agent Abboud was per-\nmitted to open and to view CDT computer data on-site. How-\never, the plain language of the search warrant did not exclude\nthe assistance of other law enforcement officers—especially\nfor tasks involving non-digital work (such as seeking coopera-\ntion from persons on site). The warrant only required that\ncomputer personnel be the ones to determine whether on-site\nsegregation of target data is feasible. The sort of assistance\nprovided by Agent Novitzky, a non-specialized law enforce-\nment officer under the guidance of Agent Abboud, was per-\nmissible under the search warrant and reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment.\n\n   The dissent criticizes the government’s decision to “copy\nthe entire directory,” pursuant to Agent Abboud’s recommen-\ndation, rather than to “copy[ ] only the subdirectories that per-\ntained to Major League Baseball” and suggests that the\ngovernment should have trusted CDT to point out the relevant\nfiles. Dissent at 1143. The dissent explains that this approach\nwould have allowed the government to select the relevant\nfiles on-site: “Dr. Jean Joseph of CDT later stated in an affi-\ndavit that the directory was easily searched by key word and\nwould have provided the test information about the ten play-\ners in a short period of time.” Id.\n\n   [21] We disagree. “The government should not be required\nto trust the suspect’s self-labeling when executing a warrant.”\nAdjani, 452 F.3d at 1150. Agents had no duty to rely on CDT\npersonnel to point out the files seizable under the warrant.\nLike most searched parties, CDT had an incentive to avoid\ngiving over documents of which the government might be\nunaware and to read the search warrant as narrowly as possi-\nble. Moreover, the government had no reason to confine its\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1125\nsearch to “key words” such as the names of the baseball play-\ners. “Computer files are easy to disguise or rename, and were\nwe to limit the warrant to such a specific search protocol,\nmuch evidence could escape discovery simply because of [the\ndefendants’] labeling of the files.” Id. Such a limited search\ncould easily have overlooked documents crucial to the investi-\ngation, such as the specimens at Quest, which were identified\nonly by number. See supra pp. 1086-90.\n\n   [22] We do not discern a violation of the Fourth Amend-\nment’s requirements simply because the agents determined,\nupon the review and recommendation of a computer special-\nist, that certain intermingled files could not be feasibly sorted\non-site.48 As we explained in Tamura, and reiterated in Adjani\nand Hill, the seizure of electronic evidence can entail complex\nsifting efforts. By obtaining from a neutral magistrate permis-\nsion to seize intermingled documents under a specific proto-\ncol, the government respected privacy interests while\npursuing the law enforcement. The agents’ ultimate decision\nto remove relevant data for off-site review stemmed not from\ndisregard of privacy rights, but from sensitivity to the ongoing\ndisruption caused by the search to CDT—an innocent third\nparty in the underlying investigation.\n\n                                    4\n\n   [23] Our determination that the search and seizures at CDT\nwere valid provides a necessary component of our legal anal-\nysis of Judge Mahan’s order granting the Rule 41(g) motion\nin the District of Nevada. Judge Mahan premised his order on\nthe legal conclusion that the government unlawfully seized\n  48\n    We do not reach the government’s argument that the “plain view”\nexception to the warrant requirement justified seizure of the intermingled\nevidence, because the evidence fell within the scope of the search warrant.\nSee Beusch, 596 F.2d 871 (“Because we hold that the items seized were\ncovered by the terms of the warrant, we find it unnecessary to deal with\nthe Government’s contentions that they were admissible under the ‘plain\nview’ exception to the warrant requirement.”).\n\f1126    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nintermingled data from CDT and could not use that data to\nsupport an expanded search warrant in the District of Nevada.\nOur de novo legal analysis shows that Judge Mahan misinter-\npreted Tamura. A lawful search does not produce poisonous\nfruit. Because the CDT search was lawful, the information\nseized in that search provided a legitimate basis for expanded\nwarrants in the District of Nevada. As we explained in Adjani:\n“There is no rule . . . that evidence turned up while officers\nare rightfully searching a location under a properly issued\nwarrant must be excluded simply because the evidence found\nmay support charges for a related crime (or against a suspect)\nnot expressly contemplated in the warrant.” 452 F.3d 1151; cf.\nBeusch, 596 F.2d at 877 (“[A]s long as an item appears, at the\ntime of the search, to contain evidence reasonably related to\nthe purposes of the search, there is no reason—absent some\nother Fourth Amendment violation—to suppress it.” (empha-\nsis added)); Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597 (noting that although the\nagents unambiguously had flouted the limits of the search\nwarrant “we cannot say, although we find it a close case, that\nthe officers so abused the warrant’s authority that the other-\nwise valid warrant was transformed into a general one,\nthereby requiring all fruits to be suppressed”).\n\n   Furthermore, an order to return property under Rule 41(g)\nis inappropriate where “the government’s need for the prop-\nerty as evidence continues.” United States v. Fitzen, 80 F.3d\n387, 388 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nUnited States v. Mills, 991 F.2d 609, 612 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(same). “If the United States has a need for the property in an\ninvestigation or prosecution, its retention of the property gen-\nerally is reasonable.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), advisory com-\nmittee’s note. It is when the government no longer needs the\nproperty as evidence in an investigation that a presumption in\nfavor of return arises. Fitzen, 80 F.3d at 388.\n\n  [24] A return of property should follow only a particularly\negregious violation: “The issue is whether the Government’s\nconduct was sufficiently reprehensible in this case to warrant\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1127\nthis sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327. In Ramsden, we\nrefused to impose this extreme sanction on police who had\ntime to obtain a warrant but made no effort to do so and “sim-\nply chose not to comply with [their] obligations under the\nFourth Amendment.” Id. at 325, 327. The government’s\nbehavior in this case was reasonable and fell far short of the\negregious and unchecked intrusions that might justify a return\nof property under Rule 41(g).49\n\n   [25] The government’s seizures were neither unreasonable\nnor exceeded the four corners of the warrants. Our technologi-\ncally advancing world combines in novel forms the kind of\ndata that in a previous age might have been segregated. Par-\nties are not immunized from law enforcement simply because\nthey choose to store data in complex or integrated formats.\nWe conclude that the district court abused its discretion by\ngranting the Rule 41(g) motion based upon its contrary, and\nerroneous, view of the law.50\n   49\n      We do not belabor the government’s alleged failure to follow its own\ninternal guidelines. The dissent takes note that the U.S. Attorney’s manual\nstates “that a search warrant should normally not be used to obtain confi-\ndential materials such as treatment records,” and that the Department of\nJustice’s guidelines disfavor use of a search warrant where a subpoena\nwould suffice. See Dissent at 1165. The existence of those guidelines is\nnot disputed. Yet, quite simply, the government’s guidelines do not dictate\nwhat is “reasonable” under the Fourth Amendment. If its guidelines did\nso, the government would have every reason to enact permissive internal\nrules. We have no reason or authority to give the government that perverse\nincentive.\n   50\n      We do not hold that the government enjoys a right to “wholesale” sei-\nzure of evidence without judicial authorization; indeed, our decision\nstands for the opposite. See supra Section IV; see also Tamura, 694 F.2d\nat 594-96.\n   We do not doubt that a different case might present facts under which\nthe seizure of intermingled documents would constitute an “unreasonable\nsearch[ ] and seizure[ ].” U.S. Const. amend. IV. But that case is not pres-\nented here. The government obtained proper authorization in the form of\na search warrant protocol addressed specifically to the seizure of intermin-\ngled computer documents. The search warrant was obtained “upon proba-\n\f1128      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                    V\n\n   We next consider the government’s appeal of Judge Ills-\nton’s order quashing the May 6 subpoenas, which sought from\nCDT and Quest the drug testing records and specimens for all\nMLB players who tested positive for steroids.51 Under Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 17(c)(2), a “court may quash . . . [a] subpoena if\ncompliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.” The dis-\ntrict court found that the May 2004 subpoenas constituted\nharassment and were unreasonable.52\n\n   To support its finding, the district court pointed to United\nStates v. American Honda Motor Co., 273 F. Supp. 810 (N.D.\nIll. 1967). In American Honda, the government issued sub-\npoenas that were “substantially identical” to one another but\nin different locations. Id. at 819. As a result, Honda was faced\nwith producing the same documents repeatedly, and the court\nfound this to be harassment. Id. at 819-20. American Honda,\nhowever, does not preclude the government from pursuing the\nsame information through the contemporaneous issuance of\nsubpoenas and applications for search warrants.\n\n  We addressed the issuance of contemporaneous search war-\nrants and subpoenas in In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated\nDecember 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854. There we upheld the\nvalidity of the subpoenas against the challenge that “the sub-\npoenas were served at the same time as the search warrants\n\nble cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing\nthe place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. Because our holding reaffirms that searches of elec-\ntronic databases must conform to the requirements of the Fourth Amend-\nment following the reasoning of Tamura, the dissent’s fear that all medical\ndatabases and voluntary drug testing programs will be put at risk is utterly\nunfounded. See Dissent at 1137-38, 1184-88.\n   51\n      We review a district court’s decision to quash a grand jury subpoena\nfor abuse of discretion. In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 803 F.2d at 496.\n   52\n      The district court did not find that the subpoenas were oppressive.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1129\nand the federal agents attempted to ‘enforce’ the subpoenas\nthrough immediate seizure of the documents.” Id. at 854. Not-\ning that the challenge to the subpoenas received no support in\nprecedent, we clarified the differences between subpoenas and\nsearch warrants:\n\n    Subpoenas are not search warrants. They involve dif-\n    ferent levels of intrusion on a person’s privacy. A\n    search warrant allows the officer to enter the per-\n    son’s premises, and to examine for himself the per-\n    son’s belongings. The officer, pursuant to the\n    warrant, determines what is seized.\n\nId. By comparison:\n\n    Service of a forthwith subpoena does not authorize\n    an entry into a private residence. Furthermore, the\n    person served determines whether he will surrender\n    the items identified in the subpoena or challenge the\n    validity of the subpoena prior to compliance.\n\nId. We concluded that “[t]hese differences are not eliminated\nby the fact that the search warrants and subpoenas were deliv-\nered at the same time” and observed that the complaining\nparty had “failed to show that the papers that are described in\nthe subpoenas are outside the scope of a legitimate investiga-\ntion by the grand jury.” Id. at 854-55. In addition, we specifi-\ncally emphasized the fact that the defendant was given almost\na month to comply with the subpoenas. Id. at 854.\n\n   [26] Therefore, the district court erred in finding the issu-\nance of subpoenas and the contemporaneous execution of\nsearch warrants to be unreasonable. The Players Association\nhas not argued that the evidence sought by the subpoenas is\n“outside the scope of a legitimate investigation by the grand\njury.” Id. at 855. The subpoenas were not returnable on the\nsame day that the search warrants were executed. As in In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas, the return dates on the subpoenas\n\f1130      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nwere over a month from the date on which the warrants were\nexecuted. The district court declared the May 6 subpoenas an\n“unreasonable insurance” policy, but it failed to recognize the\ndifferent purposes and requirements of the warrant as com-\npared to the subpoena and the legitimate concern that produc-\ntion of relevant evidence to the grand jury would be unduly\ndelayed. See id. at 854. It was error to conflate the two dis-\ntinct tools. Insurance it may have been; but, under the Fourth\nAmendment, unreasonable it was not.\n\n   The district court also deemed the government’s actions\nunreasonable because it found that the agents sought search\nwarrants in three separate districts in an attempt to avoid a\nruling on the motion to quash the existing subpoenas of Janu-\nary and March 2004. We note that granting the motion to\nquash would not have prevented the government from seeking\nthe search warrants, particularly given the existence of proba-\nble cause. Unlike a subpoena, a search warrant may be\nobtained only upon a showing of probable cause—a burden\nthe government sometimes considers necessary to establish in\norder to obtain certain production of evidence.53 In contrast,\na grand jury subpoena may issue simply because an Assistant\nUnited States Attorney believes the evidence may assist the\ngrand jury in furthering the progress of an ongoing investiga-\ntion which may never establish probable cause to charge any-\none. If a subpoena based on the lesser standard of evidence\ndoes not withstand review, it does not follow that a search\nwarrant premised on a far higher evidentiary showing could\nnot be authorized. As the Fourth Circuit has noted, “the fact\nthat a grand jury subpoena existed . . . at the time of the\nsearch obviously had no effect upon whether probable cause\n  53\n     Significantly, while a subpoena may be quashed, a “person to be\nsearched has no lawful way to prevent execution of the warrant.” In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas Dated December 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854. His\nremedy for an unlawful search and seizure or for the deprivation of prop-\nerty is to seek return of anything seized under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), or,\nif charges are filed, to move to suppress use of the evidence against him\nat trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b).\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1131\nexisted to search . . . for documents which were properly\nincluded within the warrant’s scope.” United States v. Photo-\ngrammetric Data Servs., Inc., 259 F.3d 229, 238 (4th Cir.\n2001), abrogated on other grounds by Crawford v. Washing-\nton, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).\n\n   As such, the district court rested its order on legally insuffi-\ncient grounds, and abused its discretion in granting the motion\nto quash. See United States v. Iverson, 162 F.3d 1015, 1026\n(9th Cir. 1998).\n\n                                  VI\n\n   Finally, we address the Non-Party Journalist’s Motion To\nUnseal, filed on November 23, 2005 by Joshua A. Gerstein.\nGerstein seeks access to “the dockets for these appeals and the\ncases below, the district court opinions and/or orders that are\nthe subject of these appeals, and all briefs filed with this Court.”54\nWe have jurisdiction over these documents, because the dis-\ntrict courts’ records transferred to us upon appeal. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 11.\n\n  Although not a party, Gerstein enjoys standing to file the\nmotion based upon his constitutional interest in the proceed-\nings:\n\n       Under the first amendment, the press and the public\n       have a presumed right of access to court proceedings\n       and documents. . . . This presumed right can be over-\n       come only by an overriding right or interest “based\n       on findings that closure is essential to preserve\n  54\n     Oral proceedings before this court on November 15, 2005, were open\nto the public. On November 9, 2005, CDT and MLB filed an unopposed\nMotion To Seal Courtroom During Oral Argument. We denied the motion\nthe next day. On November 14, 2005, CDT and MLB filed a Motion for\nReconsideration of Motion To Seal Courtroom During Oral Argument,\nwhich the government joined. We denied the motion the same day.\n\f1132      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n     higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that\n     interest.”\n\nOregonian Publ’g Co. v. District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 1465\n(9th Cir. 1990) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior\nCourt, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1985)).55 The Supreme Court has\nnoted the particular interest of media members in “publish[-\ning] information concerning the operation of government.”\nNixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978).\n\n   To decide whether Gerstein’s interest justifies unsealing\nportions of the records, the court also must consider the pri-\nvacy interests of the litigants, for “the right to inspect and\ncopy judicial records is not absolute.” Id. In the appeals at bar,\nthe records contain extremely sensitive information, espe-\ncially the drug testing records. If revealed, this information\ncould adversely affect the reputations of many competitive\nbaseball players. Therefore, the motion to unseal requires a\ncareful balancing of the interests at stake. See id. (noting that\naccess to judicial records may be limited to protect the pri-\nvacy interests of the litigants, such as to avoid disclosure of\n“sources of business information that might harm a litigant’s\ncompetitive standing”).\n\n   [27] Although we have jurisdiction to conduct a merits\nanalysis of the motion to unseal, the district courts—having\ngreater familiarity with the records56—are in a better position\nto balance the privacy interests and to determine which mate-\nrials are protected grand jury materials. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n   55\n      Gerstein premises his motion on 9th Cir. R. 27-13(c). That rule states:\n“During the pendency of an appeal, any party may file a motion with this\ncourt requesting that matters filed under seal either in the district court or\nin this court be unsealed. Any motion shall be served on all parties.” Id.\n(emphasis added). Although Joshua Gerstein is not a “party” under this\nrule, his standing derives from his constitutional interest and does not\ndepend upon the applicability of 9th Cir. R. 27-13(c).\n   56\n      Sensitive portions of the records were neither revealed nor discussed\nat oral argument before this court. See supra note 54.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       1133\n6(e). Therefore, we refer the Gerstein motion to the district\ncourts for consideration.\n\n                             VII\n\n  To summarize the resolution of these consolidated appeals:\n\n   1) We have no jurisdiction to address the legal foundation\nfor the grant of the Rule 41(g) motion in the Central District\nof California, although we recognize that our authoritative\ninterpretation of Tamura conflicts with the vision of Tamura\nupon which that order was based. The government cannot\nobtain redress for any alleged errors or impropriety in that\norder, where it failed to object in a timely manner. The gov-\nernment’s appeal of the grant of the Rule 41(g) motion is\nDISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction; the order of the Central\nDistrict of California denying the government’s motion for\nreconsideration is AFFIRMED.\n\n   2) The government’s seizures at the Quest facility in Las\nVegas were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The\norder of the District of Nevada granting the Rule 41(g) motion\nis REVERSED.\n\n   3) The record, illuminated by caselaw, reveals that the sub-\npoenas to CDT and Quest, which covered the same evidence\nas the contemporaneous search warrants, were not unreason-\nable and did not constitute harassment. The order of the\nNorthern District of California quashing the May 6 subpoenas\nis REVERSED.\n\fUNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING   1135\n                                    Volume 2 of 2\n\f1136    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n\n\n\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   One of the three extremely able district court judges who\nrejected the government’s argument summarized it best, stat-\ning: “What happened to the Fourth Amendment? Was it\nrepealed somehow?”\n\n   Although it only had a search warrant for data concerning\neleven Major League Baseball players, the government seized\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       1137\nthousands of medical records and test results involving every\nsingle Major League Baseball player. The government did not\nstop there, seizing thousands of other medical records for\nindividuals in thirteen other major sports organizations, three\nunaffiliated business entities, and three sports competitions.\nThe government now seeks to retain all of the medical infor-\nmation it obtained about persons who were not the subject of\nany criminal inquiry.\n\n   The stakes in this case are high. The government claims the\nright to seize and retain—without warrant or even a suspicion\nof criminal activity—any patient’s confidential medical\nrecord or other confidential personal information contained in\na computer directory so long as it has a legitimate warrant or\nsubpoena for any other individual patient’s record that may be\nstored on the same computer. The government attempted to\njustify this novel theory on a breathtaking expansion of the\n“plain view” doctrine, which clearly has no application to\nintermingled private electronic data.\n\n   The majority ignores the government’s plain view\nargument—a theory rejected by every district judge involved\nin this case. Instead, the majority invents a new justification\nfor approving the seizures. It holds that the boilerplate terms\nof a computer search warrant justify both the seizure of mas-\nsive amounts of confidential medical information about per-\nsons not suspected of any criminal activity and the subsequent\nwarrantless search of the information. Under the majority’s\nrationale, the government may now seize anyone’s private\nmedical records and other confidential personal information,\nand remove the records for a later warrantless search, so long\nas those records are intermingled with records that are respon-\nsive to a warrant and the government can justify that on-site\nsorting of those records would be impractical.\n\n  The consequences of this decision are profound. Today’s\ndecision will allow the government unprecedented easy\naccess to confidential medical and other private information\n\f1138    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nabout citizens who are under no suspicion of having been\ninvolved in criminal activity. At a time when our medical\ninstitutions are working diligently to provide physicians with\neasy nationwide electronic access to patient records in order\nto improve the care and treatment of our citizens, the opinion\nposes a very serious threat to the confidentiality of patient\nrecords and ultimately to the effective delivery of health care\nitself.\n\n   The majority’s holding will also significantly and adversely\nimpact the viability of voluntary workplace drug testing. As\nthe National Chamber of Commerce has pointed out in its\namicus brief, today’s decision will make it very unlikely that\nemployees or unions will agree to any voluntary employer\ndrug testing in the future, as any promise of confidentiality\nhas now been rendered completely illusory. It will make\nefforts to curb substance abuse in the workplace harder, not\neasier.\n\n   The majority’s holding also conflicts with the procedures\ndetailed by our Circuit in United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d\n591 (9th Cir. 1982) for the appropriate and constitutional pro-\ncessing of seized information not responsive to a warrant that\nis intermingled with data that is responsive to a warrant.\n\n   The majority also improperly rejects the factual findings of\nthe district judges, to which we owe deference, and adopts\nwholesale the government advocate’s view of events. The\ncareful findings and conclusions of the three distinguished\ndistrict judges who all rejected the government’s position are\ncompletely supported by the voluminous record.\n\n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n  The investigation in this case ostensibly involved Bay Area\nLab Co-Operative, popularly referenced as “Balco.” The gov-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1139\nernment suspected Balco of distributing illegal steroids to cer-\ntain athletes, including some Major League Baseball players.\nThe government knew that, pursuant to a collective bargain-\ning agreement between the Major League Baseball Players\nAssociation (“Players Association” or “MLBPA”) and Major\nLeague Baseball, confidential testing had been analyzed by\nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (“CDT”), and other labora-\ntories, for the sole purpose of determining whether Major\nLeague Baseball should adopt an individualized steroid test-\ning program.\n\n   Through the collective bargaining agreement, the players\nwere assured that the testing would be anonymous and confi-\ndential, and that the samples and individual data would be\ndestroyed upon tabulation of the results. The only object of\nthe exercise was to determine the approximate magnitude of\napparent steroid use with the goal of fashioning appropriate\npolicies to address it. The collective bargaining agreement\nacknowledged and anticipated that the tests for some players\nmight well yield positive results due to the ingestion of legal\nand proper over-the-counter supplements.\n\n   Although information developed by the government in its\ncriminal investigation pointed only to specific individuals\nwho might be involved with Balco, the government served a\ngrand jury subpoena on CDT on January 16, 2003, seeking\ndrug tests for all major league baseball players. After receiv-\ning the subpoena, the Players Association and CDT contacted\nthe United States Attorneys’ Office to discuss their concerns\nwith the breadth of the subpoena. At the government’s\nrequest, the Players Association, CDT, and Major League\nBaseball prepared and presented a “white paper” to the gov-\nernment detailing the provisions of the collective bargaining\nagreement pertaining to testing, with emphasis on the many\nconfidentiality provisions, and raising concerns about the\ninvasion of the constitutionally-protected privacy interests of\nthe players who were not involved in the Balco investigation.\n\f1140     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The Players Association and CDT assured the government\nin writing that CDT would maintain all of the subpoenaed\nrecords until the disputes were resolved by negotiation or liti-\ngation. On February 4, 2003, the Chief of the Criminal Divi-\nsion wrote the counsel for CDT indicating that the\ngovernment had accepted the assurances by CDT that none of\nthe materials sought by the subpoena would be destroyed or\naltered pending the government’s reconsideration of the sub-\npoena and a motion to quash the subpoena, if filed.\n\n   On February 12, 2004, the grand jury returned a 42-count\nindictment against Victor Conte, Jr. (Balco’s founder), James\nJ. Valente (Balco’s Vice President), Greg F. Anderson (a\ntrainer), and Remi Korchemny (a track coach). The charges\nagainst the defendants included conspiracy to possess with\nintent to distribute anabolic steroids, possession with intent to\ndistribute anabolic steroids, introduction and delivery of mis-\nbranded drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud,\nand misbranding of drugs held for sale with intent to defraud.\n\n   On March 3, the government served a second grand jury\nsubpoena on CDT, seeking information on only eleven named\nbaseball players. However, it did not withdraw the January 16\nsubpoena. On April 7, with no compromise reached and with\na return date passed, the Players Association filed a motion in\nthe Northern District of California in San Francisco to quash\nthe CDT subpoena. The motion was assigned to Judge Jeffrey\nS. White.\n\n   After learning that a motion to quash would be filed but\nbefore the motion could be heard, the government applied for\na search warrant to search the CDT offices for the same infor-\nmation it was seeking in the grand jury subpoena. The search\nwarrant application was made some 240 miles away in\nanother federal judicial district, without notice to the Players\nAssociation or to the district court in the Northern District of\nCalifornia.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1141\n   In the search warrant proceedings in the Central District of\nCalifornia, the government never brought to the magistrate\njudge’s attention that there was a motion pending before\nJudge White in the Northern District of California to quash\nthe grand jury subpoena. The affidavit did not disclose that\nthe Players Association had joined the motion. Rather, the\naffidavit stated:\n\n      The referenced grand jury subpoena, for the items\n      listed in Attachment B, was issued; however, while\n      not denying that they have the requested materials,\n      CDT has declined to comply with the subpoena and\n      has stated its intent to attempt to quash the subpoena.1\n\n   The affidavit did not disclose that CDT had agreed in writ-\ning to keep the data and other materials secured until the\nscope of the grand jury subpoena was settled, either through\nnegotiation or a ruling on a motion to quash. Rather, the affi-\ndavit justified removing computer data and equipment from\nthe searched premises on the basis that the computer data\ncould be concealed, altered, or destroyed by the user.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n  1\n    Some months later, Judge Illston asked the government: “Did you\nexplain to Judge Johnson what was happening before Judge White, even\non the day that you got him to issue the warrant?” Government counsel\nreplied, “We did inform Judge Johnson of the existence of the grand jury\nsubpoena and it’s in the warrant application of Judge Johnson that defense\nhad indicated that it wanted to move to quash the subpoena. So we did\nindicate to Judge Johnson there was a disputed grand jury issue. Yes, it\nwas disclosed to Judge Johnson.” Neither the warrant application nor the\naffidavit filed in support of the application contain any reference to pend-\ning proceedings before Judge White.\n\f1142     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The government did not have any evidence or reason to\nbelieve that CDT had engaged in steganography, booby-\ntrapping computers, or any type of data destruction or alter-\nation. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing CDT’s assur-\nances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all materials\ncalled for by the first subpoena as well as any materials called\nfor by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would not destroy\nor alter any of the materials called for by either of the subpoe-\nnas.” However, the plain import of the application was that\nCDT was improperly resisting compliance with a valid grand\njury subpoena and data was in jeopardy of being destroyed.\n\n   Based on the government’s application, a search warrant\nwas issued by Magistrate Judge Jeffrey W. Johnson in the\nCentral District of California in Los Angeles. The warrant\nauthorized the seizure of records regarding drug specimens,\ntesting, and test results of only ten specifically named Major\nLeague baseball players. The warrant also provided that if the\ncomputer data seized did not fall within any of the items to\nbe seized or was not otherwise legally seized, the government\nwould return the data. The affidavit provided by Special\nAgent Novitzky in support of the issuance of the warrants\nstated that obtaining information to link the test results to\nindividual players was necessary “to ensure that samples of\nindividuals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed.”\n\n   The warrant was issued one day after the motion to quash\nthe grand jury subpoena had been filed in the Northern Dis-\ntrict of California—creating the clear implication that the gov-\nernment was attempting to prevent Judge White from\nconsidering the motion to quash on the merits by seizing the\nproperty after ex parte presentation to another judge. Upon\narrival at the premises of CDT on the morning of the search,\nSpecial Agent Novitzky and other agents discussed with\nCDT’s attorney the need to search CDT’s computers.\n\n   The information sought in the search warrant was contained\nin three places: a segregated list only containing information\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1143\nabout the ten athletes that were the subjects of the search war-\nrant; a master list of the drug test results for all Major League\nBaseball players; and a computer directory (often referred to\nas the “Tracey directory”) that contained information and\nmedical test results for hundreds of other baseball players and\nathletes engaged in professional sports. Counsel for CDT\nrequested that all material pertaining to the specific items\nlisted in the warrant be reviewed and redacted by a magistrate\njudge or special master before it was seen by the government,\npursuant to the proper procedure described in Tamura. The\ngovernment refused the request.2 The government also\nrejected CDT’s offer to provide the records it had already seg-\nregated concerning the small subset of players at issue.\n\n   In addition to the segregated materials, the government\nseized the master list, all of the voluminous data in the Tracey\nDirectory, lists of teams and players and drug testing details,\nand eleven diskettes, all of which contained drug-test results\non hundreds of Major League Baseball players and other ath-\nletes. The agents searching the Tracey directory at the scene\nconcluded that certain of the subdirectories appeared to con-\ntain information not called for by the warrant. In fact, the\ndirectory contained 2,911 files that had nothing to do with\nMajor League Baseball drug testing, but rather contained test\nresults for numerous other sports entities and business organi-\nzations. However, instead of copying only the subdirectories\nthat pertained to Major League Baseball, the agents copied the\nentire directory. Dr. Jean Joseph of CDT later stated in an\naffidavit that the directory was easily searched by key word\nand would have provided the test information about the ten\nplayers in a short period of time.\n\n  Judge Cooper later specifically found that “[o]nce the items\n  2\n    Department of Justice Guidelines provide that, in cases involving con-\nfidential patient information, a search warrant “shall be executed in such\na manner as to minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, scrutiny of\nconfidential materials.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4(b)(4).\n\f1144    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nwere seized the requirement of the search warrant that any\nseized items not covered by the warrant be first screened and\nsegregated by computer personnel was completely ignored.”\nShe further found that Agent Novitzky himself reviewed the\nseized computer data and used what he learned to obtain the\nsubsequent search warrants issued in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, the Central District of California, and Nevada.\n\n  After the initial search, and based on the search results, the\ngovernment sought and obtained that day a second search\nwarrant from Magistrate Judge Johnson for a search of a stor-\nage facility maintained by CDT.\n\n   On the same day, the government also applied for a search\nwarrant in the District of Nevada. The warrant sought infor-\nmation in the business files of Quest Diagnostics, Inc., a labo-\nratory that had also been involved in the administration of\nMajor League Baseball’s drug testing program in 2003. The\nwarrant was limited to information concerning the ten base-\nball players identified in the Los Angles search warrant. The\naffidavit filed in support of the warrant did not disclose the\nhistory of the issuance of the grand jury subpoena or the filing\nof a motion to quash the subpoena. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Lawrence\nLeavitt issued the warrant, and the warrant was executed.\n\n   On April 9, 2004, the Players Association arranged an\nemergency hearing before Judge White, before whom the\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena was pending. The\nPlayers Association sought an order restricting the govern-\nment from disseminating any information it had obtained until\nthe Players Association had an opportunity to litigate the\nmotion to quash or a Rule 41 motion to return the seized prop-\nerty. The government argued that Judge White had no juris-\ndiction over the items seized pursuant to the search warrants,\neven though the grand jury subpoena sought the same materi-\nals.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1145\n   The government represented to the court that it would not\ndisseminate the information and would negotiate in good faith\nabout the seized items. Judge White accepted that representa-\ntion. He noted that he did not have jurisdiction over the items\nseized pursuant to the warrants, but that the motions to quash\nthe grand jury subpoenas remained pending before him. Judge\nWhite acknowledged that the position of the Players Associa-\ntion was “well taken with respect to the U.S. Attorney’s man-\nual and the government allegedly not following proper\nprocedure,” but that the Players Association had other avail-\nable remedies to resolve that issue on the merits.\n\n   On April 22, 2004, the government wrote CDT indicating\nthat it was withdrawing the January 16, 2004, subpoena and\nmodifying the subpoena of March 3, 2004. The government\ndid not inform Judge White of these actions and the January\n16 subpoena was never withdrawn.\n\n   On April 24, CDT and the Players Association filed a\nmotion in the Central District of California for return of the\nseized property or, in the alternative, appointment of a special\nmaster to redact those records so that the government retained\ndrug test results for only the ten players named in the warrant.\n\n   On April 30, 2004, the government filed its opposition to\nthe motion to return property in the Central District. In its\nopposition, despite the existence of an agreement with CDT\nthat CDT would not destroy or alter documents, the govern-\nment argued that it “had good-faith reasons to believe that\nCDT was detrimentally delaying the investigation, and that\nthere was some danger of the sought-after records being jeop-\nardized.” The government also argued that this jeopardy justi-\nfied proceeding with a search warrant under DOJ guidelines.\n\n  On the same date, April 30, 2004, based on what it had\nfound in the first search, the government sought a new search\nwarrant in the Northern District of California in San Jose for\nCDT electronic files it already had in its possession in the\n\f1146     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nTracey Directory concerning all players whose test results\nwere positive.\n\n   In contrast to the affidavit supplied in the first warrant\napplication, which purported “to ensure that samples of indi-\nviduals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed,” the\naffidavit of Agent Novitzky in support of this warrant applica-\ntion sought “authorization to conduct a thorough review of all\nmajor league baseball-related computer data” and “to seize all\ndata pertaining to illegal drug use by any member of major\nleague baseball.”\n\n   The affidavit conceded that no specific information had\nbeen uncovered linking Balco to any individual baseball play-\ners beyond the ten listed in the April 7, 2004, search warrant.\nHowever, in contrast to the first warrant application, Agent\nNovitzky averred that even though no evidence had been\ndeveloped to link the ballplayers who were not listed in the\nfirst warrant to Balco, “it is logical to assume that a review\nof the drug testing records for other players may provide addi-\ntional evidence of the use of similar illegal performance-\nenhancing drugs which establishes a link to the charged\ndefendants in the charged [Balco] case, given the relatively\nsmall number of professional baseball players and the closely-\nknit professional baseball community.”\n\n   The affidavit in support of issuance of the warrant did not\ndisclose that a grand jury subpoena had been issued for the\nsame material and that a motion to quash the subpoena was\npending in the very same district.\n\n   The affidavit also did not disclose that the parties were liti-\ngating in the Central District of California a motion for return\nof the seized property — the very property which was subject\nof the new search warrant request. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Howard W.\nLloyd issued a new search warrant for the same material that\nthe government had already searched and seized.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1147\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the District of Nevada for information contained in the files\nat Quest Diagnostics concerning all baseball players who,\naccording to the information collected in the CDT search, had\ntested positive for steroids. The application conceded that\nthere was no specific evidence linking these players to Balco.\nThe warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge Leavitt. The gov-\nernment took a large number (later reported by the govern-\nment to be 250 to 300 because of multiple samples given by\nthe players) of physical samples of bodily fluids and trans-\nported them to a lab in Los Angeles.\n\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the Central District of California in Los Angeles before a\ndifferent magistrate judge for all information contained in the\nfiles at CDT concerning all baseball players who, according\nto the information collected in the CDT search, had a positive\nmarker for steroids. The application conceded that there was\nno specific evidence linking these players to Balco. Neither\nthe application nor the affidavit filed in support of the applica-\ntion disclosed the pending proceedings concerning the grand\njury subpoenas. Based on the information provided by the\ngovernment, the warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge\nRosalyn Chapman.\n\n   On May 6, 2004, after it had executed the search warrants,\nthe government served grand jury subpoenas on CDT and\nQuest for the same materials it had sought in the April 30 and\nMay 5 search warrants. The subpoena contained the names of\nthe baseball players that had allegedly tested positive, even\nthough the government knew that the information Quest pos-\nsessed was only identifiable by number and even though the\ngovernment had assured the Players Association and Judge\nWhite that it would not disclose the names. The government\nsent a letter to Quest Diagnostics instructing the company not\nto disclose to anyone the government’s request for documents\n“indefinitely” because “[a]ny such disclosure could impede\n\f1148    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nthe investigation being conducted and thereby interfere with\nthe enforcement of the law.”\n\n   On May 21, 2004, CDT and the Players Association filed\na motion in the District of Nevada for a return of the property\nseized from Quest Diagnostics. On June 7, 2004, CDT and the\nPlayers Association filed a motion in the Northern District of\nCalifornia for return of the electronic documents seized from\nCDT pursuant to the April 30 search warrant issued by Magis-\ntrate Judge Lloyd in the Northern District.\n\n   On July 9, 2004, Judge White held a hearing on the motion\nto quash the grand jury subpoenas, but deferred action pend-\ning rulings on the motions for return of property seized pursu-\nant to the search warrants.\n\n   On August 9, 2004, Judge Susan Illston held a hearing on\nthe motion for return of the electronic data seized by the gov-\nernment pursuant to the April 30 warrant. When asked by\nJudge Illston why the government hadn’t just waited to let\nJudge White rule on the motions to quash the grand jury sub-\npoena rather than seeking search warrants for the same mate-\nrial, the government responded:\n\n    What the government really perceived ultimately as\n    a conscious decision on the part of the Major League\n    Baseball Players Association and the other parties\n    associated with it just refused to comply with what\n    the government felt was [sic] legitimate grand jury\n    subpoenas.\n\n   Later in the hearing the government argued that the search\nwarrant was necessary because a motion to quash had been\nfiled.\n\n    Counsel: The concern here was, to say, okay, we’re\n             going to face a brick wall from this legal\n             avenue . . . .\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1149\n      Judge:      What brick wall?\n\n      Counsel: The brick wall was . . .\n\n      Judge:      Judge White?\n\n      Counsel: No, no, not at all. It was the concern that\n               the requests or that discussions about\n               moving to quash the subpoena would be\n               something that would be dragged out.\n\n   At a later hearing, counsel for government confirmed that\nit would not have sought to obtain the search warrants if the\naffected parties had not filed a motion to quash the grand jury\nsubpoena.3 However, the Department of Justice Guidelines\nprovide that “The fact that the disinterested third party pos-\nsessing the materials may have grounds to challenge a sub-\npoena or other legal process is not in itself a legitimate basis\nfor the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4.\n\n  The government primarily argued that, even though the\nmaterial seized may not have been authorized under the\nsearch warrant, seizure was appropriate under the “plain\n  3\n   A hearing on December 10, 2004, discussed infra, contains this collo-\nquy:\n      Counsel:   And the government never would have done the\n                 search warrants if the grand jury process could have\n                 worked out. But it didn’t. I feel —\n      Court:     Say that last thing one more time. What you —\n      Counsel:   What I just said was we may not have ever done the\n                 search warrants if the subpoena process worked out.\n      Court:     But, I mean, there was a subpoena process pending in\n                 this building before Judge White.\n      Counsel:   Yes.\n      Court:     At the time you went and got your search warrants,\n                 and you didn’t allow that process to complete itself.\n      Counsel:   That is true.\n\f1150     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nview” doctrine. The court engaged in an extensive colloquy\nabout the search, ascertaining that the data was contained in\na file that could not be accessed readily without assistance,\nand that the agent had to scroll through 1,200 results to obtain\nthe positive tests that formed the basis of the later search war-\nrants. After noting that the government had not provided any\ncase to support its contention that the plain view doctrine\napplied in the computer context, Judge Illston made the fol-\nlowing findings:\n\n    I find absolutely staggering the implications about\n    what you say about the plain view doctrine in the\n    computer set up. In a way nothing is in plain view\n    because with the disk you look at it, you don’t see\n    anything until you stick it in the computer and it\n    does take quite a lot of work really to bring it up on\n    the screen.\n\n    So, it’s not in plain view in the sense of walking into\n    the room and seeing the scale on the desk. It takes\n    a whole lot of work to get there.\n\n    First off, none of it is cursory, there are whole indus-\n    tries that have developed in order to make it possible\n    for the disk to show up on the screen that way. So\n    it’s not cursory review. I don’t think it’s plain view.\n    I don’t think I have to go that far or make that kind\n    of choice with respect to issues that are certainly\n    going to arise. . . . Where it requires sorting through\n    information which really is on a data base, somehow\n    it’s being organized in different formats, you could\n    organize it in a format based on the ten names,\n    instead of taking it in other kinds of formats, then\n    scrolling across and taking names and information\n    off the screen, when it’s clearly information that\n    isn’t part of what was originally within the autho-\n    rized search warrant, I just think is impermissible.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1151\n  Judge Illston then granted the motion for return of seized\nproperty, with the following findings from the bench:\n\n       So, having looked at the Ramsden factors set out,\n    [there are] apparently four factors. One, whether the\n    government displayed a callous disregard for the\n    constitutional rights, two, whether the [movant] has\n    an individual right and need for the property he\n    wants returned, three, whether the [movant] would\n    be irreparably injured by denying the motion for\n    return of property, and four, whether the [movant]\n    has an adequate remedy at law for a redress of his\n    grievance. I find all four factors have been met here.\n\n       I think the government has displayed, in the chro-\n    nology of things that we’ve seen, in the way that the\n    case was taken from one judge to another judge, in\n    the way that as soon as it was challenged in one\n    court, it was immediately litigated in another court\n    without full information being shared among the\n    courts, that to me makes it a callous disregard for\n    constitutional rights. I think, it’s a seizure beyond\n    what was authorized by the search warrant, therefore\n    it violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n       Number two, I think [that both movants] here\n    have an interest and need for the property returned.\n    I think they need it returned and not so much\n    because they need it back, they got it, you got it, I\n    think what they need to get back from you what they\n    have, what you’ve taken from them because of the\n    privacy rights and the circumstances under which\n    this material was given.\n\n       Whether the [movant] would be irreparably\n    injured by denying the return of the property, I think\n    they would, and I think indeed there would be, that\n    the injury that will be suffered by volunteers not\n\f1152     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    being able to confidently provide testing under\n    promise of privacy would irreparably injure not only\n    major league baseball, I can’t imagine that there’s\n    going to be any voluntary agreement to do this kind\n    of testing, that’s probably over with already, but also\n    just has implications that are very negative for these\n    [movants], and whether the [movant] has an ade-\n    quate remedy at law, I don’t think there is any rem-\n    edy at law for the redress of these grievances.\n\n  I’m going to grant the motion.\n\n   On August 13, in the Central District of California, Magis-\ntrate Judge Johnson issued a report and recommendation rec-\nommending denial of the motion for return of property seized\nat CDT.\n\n   On August 19, in the District of Nevada, Judge James C.\nMahan held a hearing on the motion filed by the Players\nAssociation for the return of the property seized at Quest\nDiagnostics pursuant to the search warrants. The government\ndid not disclose to Judge Mahan or the Players Association\nthat it had served on Quest a grand jury subpoena for the same\nmaterials, coupled with a letter instructing Quest to keep that\nfact confidential indefinitely. At the conclusion of the hearing,\nJudge Mahan orally granted the motion. On September 7,\nJudge Mahan filed a written order granting the motion for\nreturn of the property. Judge Mahan found, in relevant part,\nthat:\n\n    2.   Under Ramsden v. United States, 2 F.3d 322\n         (9th Cir. 1993), this Court has equitable jurisdic-\n         tion to order return of that seized property. All\n         of the factors identified in Ramsden supporting\n         jurisdiction are present. The government cal-\n         lously disregarded the affected players’ constitu-\n         tional rights. The MLBPA, as representative for\n         the players, has an individual interest in and\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1153\n         need for the property that it wants returned. The\n         MLBPA would be irreparably injured if the\n         property were not returned. And the MLBPA\n         has no adequate remedy at law for redress of the\n         grievances.\n\n    3.   Under the particular circumstances of this case,\n         it was unreasonable for the Government to\n         refuse to follow the procedures set forth in\n         United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (9th Cir.\n         1982), upon learning that drug-testing records\n         for the ten athletes named in the original April\n         8 warrants executed at Quest and at Comprehen-\n         sive Drug Testing, Inc. were co-mingled with\n         records for other athletes not named in those\n         warrants.\n\n   After issuance of the order, the government declined to\nreturn the material seized from Quest in Nevada, contending\nit was entitled to retain it under the authority of the new May\n6 grand jury subpoena. To that end, the government filed a\nstay motion with Judge Mahan, arguing that it had a right to\nretain the data and samples based on the May 6 grand jury\nsubpoena, which had issued after the seizures of the material\nhad occurred. The government argued that Judge White was\nthe only judge who had jurisdiction to decide that issue. Judge\nMahan denied the stay motion. The government maintained\nthat the May 6 grand jury subpoenas independently authorized\nretention of the data and specimens; therefore, the Players\nAssociation and CDT filed a motion to quash the May 6 sub-\npoena in the Northern District of California.\n\n   On October 1, 2004, in the Central District of California,\nJudge Cooper declined to adopt Magistrate Judge Johnson’s\nrecommendation, and granted the motion for return of the\nseized CDT property. She noted that she joined “an appar-\nently ever-increasing number of district judges who have held\nthat the Government’s execution of the Search Warrant at\n\f1154    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nissue in this case demonstrated a callous disregard for the con-\nstitutional rights of the movants and their members.”\n\n  With respect to the Ramsden factors, Judge Cooper found:\n\n       All four considerations weigh in favor of the mov-\n    ing parties in this case. In assessing whether the gov-\n    ernment displayed a callous disregard for the rights\n    of the persons whose records were seized, it is\n    important to focus on the Ninth Circuit opinion in\n    United States v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591 (1982). At\n    the time of the search, Tamura was certainly settled\n    law in the Circuit, and Tamura establishes a proce-\n    dure to be followed when documents to be seized are\n    intermingled with other documents. “. . . . [T]he\n    wholesale seizure for later detained examination of\n    records not described in a warrant is significantly\n    more intrusive, and has been characterized as ‘the\n    kind of investigatory dragnet that the fourth amend-\n    ment was designed to prevent.’[citation].” Id. at 595.\n    Therefore, law enforcement officials are to seal and\n    hold such intermingled documents “pending\n    approval by a magistrate of a further search . . . .\n    Wholesale removal must be monitored by the judg-\n    ment of a neutral, detached magistrate.” Id. at 596.\n    It is particularly telling in this case that just such a\n    procedure was proposed to the Government at the\n    time of the search, and rejected.\n\n       Nor is the viewing of the seized files legitimized\n    by the Plain View doctrine. Under the exception to\n    the warrant requirement, an officer may seize what\n    he plainly views, so long as he has a lawful right to\n    access the evidence itself and its incriminating char-\n    acter is immediately apparent. Horton v. California,\n    496 U.S. 128, 136 (1990). Here, the agent did not\n    have a lawful right to access the computer records\n    and diskettes, and, as evidence provided in connec-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1155\n    tion with the Motion reveals, the evidence observed\n    is not necessarily incriminating. The Declaration of\n    Dr. Joseph states that the ingestion of nutritional\n    supplements can produce a “positive” test for ste-\n    roids.\n\n       The Government demonstrated a callous disregard\n    for the rights of persons whose records were seized\n    and searched outside the warrants.\n\n       The second consideration, whether the moving\n    party has an interest and need for return of the prop-\n    erty, is easily answered. The athletes in question vol-\n    untarily submitted to urine testing for steroids, as\n    part of an agreement that all results would remain\n    confidential and be used only for statistical analysis.\n    Their interest in privacy is obvious.\n\n       The third consideration, whether the moving party\n    has an interest and need for return of the property is\n    easily answered. The careers of these athletes could\n    be profoundly, negatively affected by release of\n    these records, and their return is vitally important.\n    The harm they would suffer if the records were\n    released (even if the positive tests are shown to be\n    innocuous) would be irreparable.\n\n       Finally, it is evident that the movants have no\n    other legal remedy. No motion to suppress the evi-\n    dence is available to them; they are neither defen-\n    dants nor suspects, and no case exists in which this\n    issue could be litigated.\n\n  In addition to her findings and conclusions, Judge Cooper\nadded these comments in a section labeled “Serious Con-\ncerns:”\n\n       The documents presented to the Court in connec-\n    tion with this Motion reveal extremely troubling\n\f1156    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    conduct on the part of the Government. The picture\n    painted is one of almost desperate effort to acquire\n    evidence by whatever means could be utilized. The\n    Government negotiated with movants’ attorneys\n    over the breadth of the grand jury subpoenas;\n    received assurances in writing that the records of the\n    ten athletes would be secured while the Court\n    resolved the issue, and the day after the issue was\n    presented to a Court, went to another district and\n    sought a search warrant. That conduct would be sus-\n    pect in itself. But in seeking the warrant (not the cor-\n    rect procedure for obtaining documents for a third\n    party who is not a suspect), the Government\n    explained to the Magistrate that the records in ques-\n    tion were in danger of being destroyed. This is bla-\n    tant misrepresentation, as demonstrated by the\n    records in this case.\n\n       Four days after Movants filed a motion before\n    Magistrate Judge Johnson for return of the property,\n    the Government obtained a further warrant from a\n    Magistrate Judge in the Northern District of Califor-\n    nia. And while a motion for return of that property\n    was pending, the Government obtained two more\n    warrants in the Central District of California (not\n    from Magistrate Judge Johnson) and in Nevada. The\n    image of quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no\n    one can find the pea would be humorous if the mat-\n    ter were not so serious.\n\n   Noting that “the Government is held to a far higher stan-\ndard than has been demonstrated in this case,” and that “this\nis the third District Court Order compelling the Government\nto return property illegally seized,” Judge Cooper ordered\nreturn of the seized CDT property forthwith.\n\n  On December 10, 2004, Judge Illston held a hearing on the\nPlayers Association motion to intervene and to quash the May\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1157\n6, 2004 grand jury subpoenas served on CDT and Quest. At\nthe conclusion of the hearing, Judge Illston made the follow-\ning oral findings and conclusions:\n\n       I find that the MLBPA has the right to intervene\n    in this matter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n    24(a), as it has an interest in the samples and test\n    results in the possession of CDT and Quest, which\n    were created with the promise of anonymity under\n    the mandatory testing of the 2002 collective bargain-\n    ing agreement.\n\n       The May 6th, 2004 subpoenas were the culmina-\n    tion of a series of actions taken by the government\n    in order to prevent MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to\n    move to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n    Instead of allowing the matter to be resolved in a sin-\n    gle proceeding before Judge White, the government\n    executed a series of search warrants in three different\n    districts once it learned that petitioners would move\n    to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n\n       The government has provided no substantial\n    explanation of why this course of action was neces-\n    sary. Given that the government had no other basis\n    for issuing the April search warrants and preempting\n    the subpoenas served on Quest and CDT, the deci-\n    sion appears to have been a tactical decision to pre-\n    vent the parties from raising objections before Judge\n    White, which is unreasonable and constitutes harass-\n    ment similar to the conduct in United States v. Amer-\n    ican Honda.\n\n       Furthermore, the May 6th subpoenas were served\n    after the government had obtained evidence pursuant\n    to the April 7 and April 30 search warrants, which\n    has now been determined to have been illegally\n    seized. Some of the information sought in the May\n\f1158     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    6th subpoena was already in the government’s pos-\n    session at the time the subpoena was served on CDT\n    and Quest; therefore, the Court finds that the May\n    6th subpoena served as an unreasonable insurance\n    policy as recognized in the motion for the return of\n    seized property cited in the papers, 681 F.Supp. [sic]\n\n      For these reasons the court grants petitioner’s\n    motion to quash the May 6th subpoena served on\n    Quest and CDT as an abuse of the grand jury process\n    and unreasonable under Federal Rule of Criminal\n    Procedure 17(c).\n\n   On October 18, 2005, as a result of a plea agreement, Balco\nfounder Victor Conte received a sentence of eight months\nimprisonment, with four months of the sentence to be served\nin home confinement. James Valente, Balco’s vice president,\nwas sentenced to probation. Trainer Greg Anderson was sen-\ntenced to six months imprisonment, with three of the six\nmonths to be spent in home confinement. On February 25,\n2006, track coach Remi Korchemny was sentenced to one\nyear of probation.\n\n   In reviewing both the order quashing the grand jury sub-\npoena and the orders granting the motions for return of prop-\nerty pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), we review the factual\nfindings of the district courts for clear error. In re Grand Jury\nSubpoenas Dated Dec. 10, 1987, 926 F.2d 847, 854 (9th Cir.\n1991) (orders to quash grand jury subpoenas); United States\nv. Marolf, 173 F.3d 1213, 1216 (9th Cir. 1999) (orders on\nmotions for return of property). We review orders quashing\nsubpoenas for abuse of discretion. United States v. Bergeson,\n425 F.3d 1221, 1224 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing In re Grand Jury\nSubpoena, 357 F.3d 900, 906 (9th Cir. 2004)). We review de\nnovo a district court’s denial of a motion for return of prop-\nerty pursuant to Rule 41(g). Marolf, 173 F.3d at 1216.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING              1159\n                                   II\n\n   Regarding the two preliminary jurisdictional questions—\n(1) whether the Players Association had standing to file the\nFed. R. Civ. P. 41(g) motions for return of property on behalf\nof its members, and (2) whether the government timely\nappealed Judge Cooper’s order granting the Rule 41(g)\nmotion—I agree with the conclusions reached by the majority.4\nI also agree with the majority that Judge Cooper did not abuse\nher discretion in denying the government’s motion to recon-\nsider certain findings made in her order.\n\n                                   III\n\n   Application of the proper standard of review should have\nsettled this appeal without much ado. We review the findings\nof fact underlying the district court’s determination of lawful-\nness of a search for clear error. United States v. Stafford, 416\nF.3d 1068, 1073 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing United States v.\nDeemer, 354 F.3d 1130, 1132 (9th Cir. 2004)). Review under\nthe clearly erroneous standard is significantly deferential,\nrequiring a “definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\nbeen committed,” before a finding can be overturned. Easley\nv. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 242 (2001). As long as the dis-\ntrict court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the\nrecord viewed in its entirety, we may not reverse it even if we\nare convinced that, had we been sitting as the trier of fact, we\nwould have weighed the evidence differently. SEC v. Rubera,\n350 F.3d 1084, 1094 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n  Here, the district courts made the factual finding that the\ngovernment did not comply with the terms of the CDT search\nwarrant in seizing the non-Balco data. The district courts\nfound, as a matter of fact, that the seizure of the non-Balco\n  4\n   I acknowledge and appreciate the majority’s willingness to revisit the\nquestion of whether the government timely appealed Judge Cooper’s\norder.\n\f1160    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ndata was not authorized by the warrant. The district courts\nfound, as a matter of fact, that the government had not com-\nplied with the terms of the Tamura procedure. The district\ncourts collectively found that the action of the government in\nseizing the property was so “egregious” that it rose to the\nlevel of a callous disregard for the rights of the property own-\ners. Under our significantly deferential standard of review,\nthat should be the end of the matter.\n\n   We review a district court decision to exercise its equitable\njurisdiction under Rule 41(g) under the deferential abuse of\ndiscretion standard. Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 324. Similarly, we\nreview district court decisions on motions to quash grand jury\nsubpoenas for abuse of discretion. In re Grand Jury Sub-\npoena, Dated April 18, 2003, 383 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir.\n2004). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we cannot\nreverse unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the\ndistrict court committed a clear error of judgment in the con-\nclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Winter, 2007 WL\n2481465, *4 (9th Cir. 2007). Here, there is no doubt the dis-\ntrict courts weighed the appropriate factors pertaining to the\nRule 41(g) motion and elected to exercise equitable power to\nreturn property. There is also no doubt that Judge Illston\nbased her decision on the motion to quash on a correct view\nof the law and appropriately considered all of the evidence. In\nre Grand Jury Subpoena, 383 F.3d at 909. On appellate\nreview, we cannot say that these judges abused the discretion\nreposed in them.\n\n   The majority chooses instead to substitute its own factual\nfindings concerning the government’s compliance with the\nwarrants and interpose its own de novo opinion as to the exer-\ncise of discretion. That is not our function. In addition, our\nappellate review ought to be significantly more deferential\nwhen we confront the uniform factual findings and collective\nexercise of judicial discretion of three experienced district\njudges from three separate judicial districts. However,\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1161\nbecause our deferential standards of review were discarded in\nthis case, I will proceed to a merits discussion.\n\n                                    IV\n\n   I agree with the majority that Judge Mahan properly exer-\ncised equitable jurisdiction over the Rule 41(g) motions.5\nRamsden identified four factors that district courts must con-\nsider before exercising equitable jurisdiction to order the\nreturn of property, namely whether: (1) the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant; (2) the movant has an individual interest in and the\nneed for the property he wants returned; (3) the movant would\nbe irreparably injured by denying return of the property; and\n(4) the movant has an adequate remedy at law for the redress\nof his grievance. 2 F.3d at 324.\n\n   Although I agree with the majority that the district courts\nproperly exercised equitable jurisdiction, I disagree with the\nmajority’s analysis in reaching that conclusion. Because the\nequitable jurisdictional analysis in large part drives the analy-\nsis of the merits of the Rule 41(g) decisions, it is important\nto detail my differences with the majority on this issue.\n  5\n    Because Judge Cooper’s order is not reviewable, like the majority, I\nreview only Judge Mahan’s order in this section. However, the legal anal-\nysis applicable to both orders is largely the same. Further, Judge Cooper’s\nconclusive determination that the materials seized from CDT must be\nreturned because they were taken in callous disregard of the non-Balco\nplayers’ constitutional rights has an impact on the validity of Judge\nMahan’s order. Since the CDT materials were a necessary prerequisite for\nthe granting of the Quest search warrant, the fact that those materials were\nimproperly seized removes the foundation for the legality of the Quest\nwarrant. Although the Quest warrant is not directly challenged in this case,\nI address below how the final order from Judge Cooper also serves to sup-\nport the result reached by Judge Mahan.\n\f1162     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                               A\n\n   The first Ramsden factor is whether the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant. The majority concludes the government did not. I\nrespectfully disagree with that conclusion. The record entirely\nsupports Judge Mahan’s conclusion that the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovants.\n\n                               1\n\n   The doctrine of issue preclusion requires us to accept as\ndecided that the government callously disregarded the non-\nBalco players’ rights when it seized those players’ records\nfrom CDT. Clements v. Airport Authority of Washoe County,\n69 F.3d 321, 329-30 (9th Cir. 1995). Judge Cooper ordered\nthe CDT-seized property returned, holding that the govern-\nment demonstrated a callous disregard for the constitutional\nrights of the movants and their members. That holding, now\nfinal, is entitled to res judicata effect. Because the affidavit\nsubmitted to Magistrate Judge Leavitt that formed the basis\nfor the May 5, 2004, Quest search warrant relied on the mate-\nrials Judge Cooper has now conclusively determined were\nseized in callous violation of the players’ rights, the materials\nseized pursuant to the May 5 warrant are fruit of that poison-\nous tree. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488\n(1963); Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S.\n385, 391 (1920).\n\n  Indeed, the government’s approach—using the results of\none tainted search after another to justify the next search—\nwas rejected decades ago by the Supreme Court. In Silver-\nthorne Lumber, the Court considered a situation akin to the\none at bar. In describing the government’s argument in that\ncase, the Court wrote:\n\n    The proposition could not be presented more\n    nakedly. It is that although of course its seizure was\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1163\n      an outrage which the Government now regrets, it\n      may study the papers before it returns them, copy\n      them, and then may use the knowledge it has gained\n      to call upon the owners in a more regular form to\n      produce them; that the protection of the Constitution\n      covers the physical possession but not any advan-\n      tages that the Government can gain over the object\n      of its pursuit by doing the forbidden act.\n\n251 U.S. at 391.\n\n   The Supreme Court forcefully rejected this idea, stating\nthat adoption of such a theory would “reduce[ ] the Fourth\nAmendment to a form of words.” Id. at 392.\n\n  The Court concluded:\n\n      The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition\n      of evidence in a certain way is that not merely the\n      evidence so acquired shall not be used before the\n      Court but that it shall not be used at all.\n\nId.\n\n   Judge Cooper declared the seizures illegal and ordered the\nmaterial returned. That binding decision means that the gov-\nernment could not use the fruits of the search to justify its\nsubsequent search in Nevada. The majority fails to explain\nhow the government can disregard the players rights in seiz-\ning the spreadsheet from CDT, but not disregard their rights\nin using that spreadsheet to seize the urine samples them-\nselves from Quest.\n\n                               2\n\n  Even notwithstanding any preclusive effect stemming from\nJudge Cooper’s order, the record more than amply supports\nJudge Mahan’s ruling on its own merits.\n\f1164      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The record supports the conclusion that the government\nsought and executed the search warrants and took subsequent\nlegal action as a tactical measure to prevent the Players Asso-\nciation and CDT from litigating their motion to quash and\nother objections to the wholesale production of CDT data and\nthus the Quest data that the CDT materials begot.6 The gov-\nernment applied for, and executed, the initial search warrants\nafter CDT and the Players Association informed the govern-\nment they would be filing a motion to quash the grand jury\nsubpoenas. Government counsel conceded on the record that\nthe motivation for seeking the search warrants was the “brick\nwall” presented by the filing of the motions to quash, even\nthough DOJ guidelines state that “[t]he fact that the disinter-\nested third party possessing the materials may have grounds\nto challenge a subpoena or other legal process is not in itself\na legitimate basis for the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R.\n§ 59.4.\n\n   The majority points out that the DOJ guidelines do not give\nrise to substantive rights. That may be so, but it is beside the\npoint. The guidelines form a baseline from which to judge the\nreasonableness of unjustified deviations from the standard\npractices they outline. The guidelines are certainly relevant to\nthe question before the district court, namely whether the gov-\nernment exhibited callous disregard for the rights of third par-\nties. The guidelines plainly state that it is not legitimate to use\na search warrant because a party may be challenging a sub-\npoena; the government admitted that this was precisely the\nreason it issued the warrants in this case.\n\n   Further, as Judge Cooper found, the use of a search warrant\nto obtain documents from a third party is inappropriate. The\n  6\n    Although we only have jurisdiction to review Judge Mahan’s order,\nbecause the Quest search warrant was based, in part, on materials seized\nfrom CDT, an analysis of the propriety of the CDT warrants is necessary\nto a full analysis of whether Judge Mahan properly exercised his discre-\ntion in ordering the non-Balco samples seized from Quest returned.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            1165\nDepartment of Justice Guidelines address this point specifi-\ncally:\n\n    A search warrant should not be used to obtain docu-\n    mentary materials believed to be in the private pos-\n    session of a disinterested third party unless it appears\n    that the use of a subpoena, summons, request, or\n    other less intrusive alternative means of obtaining\n    the materials would substantially jeopardize the\n    availability or usefulness of the materials sought, and\n    the application for the warrant has been authorized\n    as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 59.4(a)(1); see also U.S. Attorney’s Manual § 9-\n19.210.\n\n  The U.S. Attorney’s Manual also provides that a search\nwarrant should normally not be used to obtain confidential\nmaterials such as treatment records. §§ 9-19.220, 9-19.230.\n\n   The simple and undisputed fact is that the government\ndeviated from its usual and appropriate protocol. Documents\nheld in the possession of third parties are appropriately\nobtained through use of grand jury subpoena, not search war-\nrant. The record is quite clear that the government used the\nvehicle of a search warrant only because it thought its grand\njury subpoenas might be contested. As the DOJ Guidelines\nrecognize, that is an inappropriate use of a search warrant.\nJudge Mahan was entitled on the basis of the record to find\nthat the government undertook this action in an attempt to\nprevent the Players Association and CDT from litigating the\nmerits of their objections to the grand jury subpoenas and thus\nthat the Quest search warrant was procured via tainted means.\n\n   Further, the entire record of the case shows a repeated pat-\ntern of the government attempting to prevent a full hearing on\nthe merits of the Players Association legal challenges. In vir-\ntually each hearing in which CDT and the Players Association\n\f1166      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\narticulated their objections, the government argued that\nanother court had primary jurisdiction or that the action of\nanother court dictated the result.7 The record supports the dis-\ntrict courts’ collective conclusion that, as Judge Cooper put it,\nthe government’s actions constituted a “desperate effort to\nacquire evidence by whatever means could be utilized,” by\nmeans of “quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no one\ncan find the pea.”\n\n                                     3\n\n   The record also supports the conclusion that the govern-\nment made misleading statements in its application for search\nwarrants and that the actions of the government in executing\nthe search warrants were a mere pretext for inappropriately\nseizing confidential medical data about Major League Base-\nball players who were not under any particularized suspicion\nof criminal activity.\n\n   The application contained lengthy representations about\nhow computer data could be destroyed and stated that “while\nnot denying that they have the requested materials, CDT has\ndeclined to comply with the subpoena and has stated its intent\nto quash the subpoena.” The affidavit did not disclose that\nCDT had agreed in writing to keep the data and other materi-\nals secured until the scope of the grand jury subpoena was set-\n  7\n    To provide but a few examples: Before Judge White, who was consid-\nering the initial motion to quash, the government argued that he should\ndefer ruling because he had no jurisdiction over the materials seized by the\nwarrant. The government urged Judge Illston to wait to decide the Rule\n41(g) motion until Magistrate Judge Johnson had ruled on the separate\nRule 41(g) motion. The government urged Judge Johnson to consider that\nprobable cause had already been established by the issuance of a search\nwarrant by Magistrate Judge Lloyd. The government contended Judge\nMahan lacked jurisdiction to order the property seized under the warrant\nreturned because it had separately obtained a grand jury subpoena for the\nsame item, urging him to wait until Judge White had ruled on the motion\nto quash (not disclosing that it had asked Judge White to defer until the\nRule 41(g) motions had been decided).\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1167\ntled, either through negotiation or a ruling on a motion to\nquash. The affidavit did not disclose that the Chief of the\nCriminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office had\naccepted the assurances in writing.\n\n  Rather, the affidavit justified removing computer data and\nequipment from the searched premises on the basis that:\n\n    Computer users can attempt to conceal data within\n    computer equipment and storage devices through a\n    number of methods, including the use of innocuous\n    or misleading filenames and extensions. . . . Com-\n    puter users can also attempt to conceal data by using\n    encryption, which means that a password or device,\n    such as a “dongle” or “keycard,” is necessary to\n    decrypt the data into readable form. In addition,\n    computer users can conceal data within another\n    seemingly unrelated and innocuous file in a process\n    called “steganography.” For example, by using ste-\n    ganography, a computer user can conceal text in an\n    image file which cannot be viewed when the image\n    file is opened. Therefore, a substantial amount of\n    time is necessary to extract and sort through data that\n    is concealed or encrypted to determine whether it is\n    evidence, contraband or instrumentalities of a crime.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n\n   As previously stated, the government did not have any evi-\ndence or reason to believe that CDT had engaged in any of\nthis sort of conduct that might have jeopardized the evidence\nbeing sought. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing\nCDT’s assurances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all\n\f1168    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nmaterials called for by the first subpoena as well as any mate-\nrials called for by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would\nnot destroy or alter any of the materials called for by either\nof the subpoenas.” The plain import of the application was\nthat CDT was improperly resisting compliance with a valid\ngrand jury subpoena and data was in jeopardy of being\ndestroyed. It implied that CDT was not being forthright about\nthe information it possessed, when in fact there was no sug-\ngestion that CDT was attempting to mislead the government\nin any respect.\n\n   The search warrant application did not disclose that the\nPlayers Association, on behalf of the individuals whose medi-\ncal files were at issue, had intervened and had joined CDT’s\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena. The application did\nnot disclose the history of negotiations between the parties,\nand that the concern was about the breadth of the subpoena.\nThe application did not disclose that the written assurances\nmade by CDT and accepted by the government contemplated\nresolving the disputed issues through a motion to quash if\nnecessary. Rather, the application implied that CDT was tak-\ning unjustified unilateral action.\n\n   The majority implies that the government constructed a\ncareful search protocol carefully tailored to the CDT opera-\ntion that it presented to the magistrate judges. However, the\naffidavits and protocol incorporate merely boilerplate lan-\nguage. Had the government disclosed to the magistrate judge\nthat it intended, in the course of its search for material on a\nhandful of players, to seize thousands of records pertaining to\nthirteen other major sports organizations, three unaffiliated\nbusiness entities, and three sports competitions, and that the\nentity to be subject to the search had already segregated the\nresponsive information for production, there is no doubt in my\nmind that the reaction of the judge would have been com-\npletely different.\n\n   Given these undisputed facts, the district courts were enti-\ntled to conclude that the government made misleading state-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1169\nments in its applications for search warrants and that the\nactions of the government in executing the search warrants\nwere a mere pretext for inappropriately seizing confidential\nmedical data about Major League Baseball players who were\nnot under any particularized suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n                              4\n\n   Notwithstanding the government’s bold and apparently\ndeceptive tactics, the majority claims the government none-\ntheless complied with the terms of the warrants and therefore\nthat Judge Mahan’s ruling must be reversed.\n\n  First, this contention flies in the face of Judge Cooper’s\nspecific factual finding that the government did not comply\nwith the terms of the warrant. She found that “the requirement\nof the Warrant that the seized items not covered by the war-\nrant be first screened and segregated by computer personnel\nwas completely ignored.” As she elaborated:\n\n    [T]he warrant did not require mere “consultation”\n    and “participation” with computer personnel, but\n    required computer personnel to actually make an ini-\n    tial review of computer equipment and storage\n    devices to determine if they could be searched on-\n    site, to determine whether it was practical to copy\n    the data, and to seize and transport the equipment\n    devices if necessary. The warrant required “appro-\n    priately trained personnel” to review the seized items\n    to determine what data fell within the warrant. This\n    clearly not the role [agent] Abboud played. The\n    Court therefore considered this evidence and found\n    it unconvincing in showing that the Government\n    complied with the warrant.\n\n   Judge Cooper’s factual finding, which we review for clear\nerror, is amply supported by the record.\n\f1170    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   It is undisputed that, in anticipation of responding to the\ngrand jury subpoena, CDT had already segregated the mate-\nrial about the specific individuals that was sought by the gov-\nernment. When agents arrived the President of CDT, Kim\nJasper, informed the government that there was an envelope\nthat contained the drug testing results, executed chain of cus-\ntody forms, and laboratory reports for all ten of the players\nspecified in the search warrant. When Jasper opened the box\nfor the agents, they seized not only the envelope, but also\ncomputer disks and other material. They seized the material\nwithout examining it. One of the disks was completely blank.\n\n   Similarly, another CDT employee had created hard copy\ninformation responsive to the grand jury subpoena, which\nCDT provided to the government. The government wished to\nview the hard drive from which the information derived. CDT\nallowed them access and directed them to the subdirectory in\nthe Tracey Directory were the Major League Baseball drug\ntesting results were kept. The agents not only copied the sub-\ndirectory, but the entire Tracey directory which included\nthousands of obviously irrelevant material. The affidavit sup-\nporting the CDT search warrant explained that, if necessary,\nthe agents could conduct an off-site search. Rather than seize\non any of the opportunities presented to avoid the more-\nintrusive search, the agents proceeded to do everything possi-\nble to assure that result. In addition to rejecting CDT’s offer\nto produce the responsive documents, the agents also declined\nto attempt any keyword searches to isolate responsive docu-\nments on site. The agents also ignored the fact that sub-\ndirectories containing files relevant to Major League Baseball\nwere clearly labeled—as were the many subdirectories con-\ntaining confidential information about other sports\norganizations—and instead seized the entire Tracey Direc-\ntory.\n\n  The majority argues that “[t]he government should not be\nrequired to trust the suspect’s self-labeling when executing a\nwarrant.” But CDT was not a suspect; it was a third party. The\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1171\nmajority, without any support in the record, goes on to place\nthe independent laboratory in the category of criminal sus-\npects, stating that “[l]ike most searched parties, CDT had an\nincentive to avoid giving over documents of which the gov-\nernment might be unaware and to read the search warrant as\nnarrowly as possible.”8 What the undisputed record indicates\nis that CDT had already segregated the material in anticipa-\ntion of cooperating with the government’s grand jury sub-\npoena; that CDT had assured the government in writing of its\ncooperation; and that the government had accepted those\nassurances. In the end, the proof is in the pudding. After\nexamining all of the massive amount of seized data, after fil-\ning numerous declarations in support of the legitimacy of the\ngovernment’s search, and after much protesting about its sus-\npicions about CDT, the government does not identify a single\npiece of information responsive to the warrant that CDT did\nnot have already segregated and ready for production.\n\n   In short, the so called warrant protocol, relied on by the\nmajority, was completely discarded, as Judge Cooper found.\nThe government did not have a meaningful consultation with\nCDT officials about production of responsive material. It\nengaged in a wholesale dragnet operation indiscriminately\ngathering as much data as it could lay its hands on. The pre-\ntextual nature of the search was highlighted in later govern-\n   8\n     The majority’s unwarranted speculation as to the motivation of profes-\nsional, independent laboratories to conceal information is belied by the\nDOJ Guidelines. Indeed, the DOJ computer search manual contemplates\nthat “[s]ometimes, . . . [a] friendly employee or system administrator may\nagree to pinpoint a file or record or may have a recent backup, permitting\nthe agents to obtain a hard copy of the files they seek while on-site.” See\nComputer Crime & Intellectual Prop. Section, Criminal Div., U.S. Dep’t\nof Justice, Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic\nEvidence in Criminal Investigations, pts. 1-2 at II.B.1.b. (2002), available\nat http://www.cybercrime.gov/s&smanual2002.htm (citing, e.g., United\nStates v. Longo, 70 F. Supp. 2d 225 (W.D.N.Y. 1999) (upholding pinpoint\nsearch aided by suspect’s secretary for two particular computer files)).\nNonetheless, the searching agents rejected precisely that kind of assistance\nhere.\n\f1172    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nment affidavits, in which agent Novitsky argues that he\nbelieves he was entitled to seize data at the scene on athletes\nother than those identified in warrant under the plain view\ndoctrine. Of course, he had previously averred to the magis-\ntrate judge that obtaining a list of the ballplayers’ names cor-\nrelated to the laboratory test numbers was justified “to ensure\nthat samples of individuals not associated with Balco are left\nundisturbed.”\n\n  Judge Cooper’s factual finding that the government did not\ncomply with the terms of the warrant is completely supported\nby the record.\n\n   Second, following the seizure, the government did not fol-\nlow the Tamura procedure and did not follow the warrant pro-\ntocol of segregating the non-responsive information. Rather,\nonce off-site, instead of allowing only technical experts to\nsegregate the responsive from the unresponsive data, the gov-\nernment allowed the lead investigator to peruse all of the\nmaterial in the Tracey Directory, contrary to the specific\ninstructions in the warrant. After examining the confidential\ninformation it had no right to see, the government then sought\nto sanitize its actions by asking another magistrate judge for\na search warrant to examine the data it had already searched.\n\n   For decades, we have condemned the indiscriminate seizure\nof materials that are not responsive to a valid search warrant.\nIn Tamura, we stated that “the wholesale seizure for later\ndetailed examination of records not described in a warrant . . .\nhas been characterized as ‘the kind of investigatory dragnet\nthat the fourth amendment was designed to prevent.’ ” 694\nF.2d at 595 (quoting United States v. Abrams, 615 F.2d 541,\n543 (1st Cir. 1980)). Tamura held that “the government’s\nwholesale seizure of company documents [is] illegal [when]\nthe agents intentionally seize[ ] materials they [know] were\nnot covered by the warrant.” United States v. Hill, 322 F.\nSupp. 2d 1081, 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (Kozinski, J., sitting by\ndesignation).\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1173\n   Under Tamura, where “documents are so intermingled that\nthey cannot be feasibly sorted on site,” we directed that law\nenforcement officers should “seal[ ] and hold[ ] the docu-\nments pending approval by a magistrate . . . .” Id. at 595-96.\nAs we noted:\n\n      The essential safeguard required is that wholesale\n      removal must be monitored by the judgment of a\n      neutral, detached magistrate. In the absence of an\n      exercise of such judgment prior to the seizure in the\n      present case, it appears to us that the seizure, even\n      though convenient under the circumstances, was\n      unreasonable.\n\nId. at 596 (footnote omitted).9\n\n   The Tamura protocol provides a sensible and practical\napproach to the problem posed by intermingled electronic\nrecords. It allows the government to seize the intermingled\nfiles, but not to view them until a neutral and detached magis-\ntrate has first reviewed the records. Indeed, had the Tamura\nprotocol been followed, it is likely that the government would\nhave obtained the information it sought with the warrants:\ncomplete drug testing and related information on the ten spec-\nified players.\n\n   If the government is going to be allowed to sift through\nreams of potentially unresponsive data in the digital context\nin order to identify responsive files, it cannot be allowed to\n  9\n   The Tenth Circuit adopted the Tamura approach specifically in the\ncomputer context in Carey, holding that:\n      Where officers come across relevant documents so intermingled\n      with irrelevant documents that they cannot feasibly be sorted at\n      the site, the officers may seal or hold the documents pending\n      approval by a magistrate of the conditions and limitations on a\n      further search through the documents.\n172 F.3d at 1275.\n\f1174    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nuse anything it finds to seek further warrants to retain that\ndata when there is no independent probable cause to other-\nwise view it or retain it. To do so completely subverts the\nFourth Amendment warrant requirement and allows the gov-\nernment to obtain post hoc justification for a search for which\nthey had no probable cause to conduct before conducting it.\nSuch a procedure invites an abuse of the off-site process that\nthreatens both the privacy of computer data as well as the\ngovernment’s ability to reasonably search it.\n\n   The majority relies on United States v. Adjani, 452 F.3d\n1140 (9th Cir. 2006), and United States v. Hill, but those deci-\nsions supply no support for a deviation from the Tamura pro-\ncedure. In Adjani, in execution of a lawful warrant,\ninvestigators seized a computer owned by the defendant and\na computer owned by his girlfriend, who was also a suspect.\nIn sustaining the search of her computer, we reasoned that the\ngovernment acts within the scope of the warrant when it\nseizes material that is “both related to the purposes of [the]\nsearch and [is] implicated . . . in the crime.” Id. (emphasis\nadded). Here, the government seized hundreds of records that\nwere clearly outside the scope of the Balco-limited warrant,\nthat were unrelated to the purposes of the Balco-limited\nsearch, and were indicative of no crime whatsoever. The\nmaterials seized at CDT were not related to the purpose of the\nsearch or implicated in the alleged crimes involving Balco.\n\n   Hill did not involve a seizure, but a challenge to an alleg-\nedly overbroad warrant. In contrast, this case is not about the\noverbreadth of the warrant but rather about whether the mate-\nrials seized and kept and used by the government were within\nthe scope of the warrant. Id. at 977 (“the officers’ wholesale\nseizure was flawed here because they failed to justify it to the\nmagistrate, not because they acted unreasonably or improp-\nerly in executing the warrant”). To the extent Hill is relevant,\nit declined to suppress material that was “described in and\ntherefore taken pursuant to the valid search warrant.” Id.\n(quoting Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597). In contrast, the records\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1175\nsought by the MLBPA here that do not pertain to the ten\nnamed Balco-connected players were not described anywhere\nin the search warrant. Importantly, Hill specifically declined\nto address the question of intermingled files. 459 F.3d at 978\nn.14.\n\n   Neither Adjani nor Hill address the question of intermin-\ngled files. Tamura did, however, and there is no dispute that\nthe government did not follow the post-seizure Tamura proto-\ncol, as the district courts appropriately found. The majority’s\nattempt to paper over this failure by suggesting the search was\nconducted in accordance with the warrant or justified by the\nissuance of subsequent search warrants based on the tainted\nseized information is unavailing.\n\n   In sum, the search did not comply with the warrant terms\nand the post-seizure conduct did not comply with Tamura.\nThus, I must respectfully disagree with the majority’s conclu-\nsion that the CDT search and seizure was conducted in accor-\ndance with the Fourth Amendment and our precedent\ngoverning electronic searches and seizures.\n\n                               5\n\n   For all of these reasons, the district court’s conclusion that\nthe government acted in callous disregard of the rights of the\nplayers is completely supported by the record. The district\ncourts made no error in finding that the first Ramsden factor\nwas satisfied.\n\n                               B\n\n   The second Ramsden factor is whether the movant has an\nindividual interest in and the need for the property he wants\nreturned. I agree with the majority and the district courts that\nthe Players Association satisfied this requirement. At issue are\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of the players. As we know, the\nFourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable\n\f1176     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nsearches and seizures into areas in which they have a legiti-\nmate expectation of privacy. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S.\n347, 360-61 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). There is no doubt\nthat the affected baseball players had a justified,\nconstitutionally-protected privacy interest in the seized prop-\nerty, including the computer data and the physical urine sam-\nples. However, I believe that the majority significantly\ndiscounts and underestimates the importance of the privacy\ninterests at stake.\n\n   The legitimate expectation of privacy in medical informa-\ntion is as old as the Hippocratic Oath.10 Indeed, “[o]ver the\nlast thirty years, the federal courts have uniformly accepted\nthe principle that medical records are private and entitled to\nprotection.” Joel Glover and Erin Toll, The Right to Privacy\nof Medical Records, 79 Denv. U. L. Rev. 540, 541 (2002). In\nthis context, the Supreme Court has recognized at least two\ndistinct kinds of constitutionally-protected privacy interests:\n“One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of per-\nsonal matters, and another is the interest in independence in\nmaking certain kinds of important decisions.” Doe v. Attorney\nGeneral, 941 F.2d 780, 795 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Whalen\nv. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977)).\n\n   We have long applied Whalen and its progeny in holding\nthat “[i]ndividuals have a constitutionally protected interest in\navoiding ‘disclosure of personal matters,’ including medical\ninformation.” Tucson Woman’s Clinic v. Eden, 379 F.3d 531,\n551 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory, 135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(“The constitutionally protected privacy interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters clearly encompasses medical\ninformation and its confidentiality.”); Yin v. California, 95\n  10\n    STEDMAN’S MEDICAL DICTIONARY, 799 (26th ed. 1995) (“All that may\ncome to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or outside of my\nprofession, or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread\nabroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal.”)\n\f             UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1177\nF.3d 864, 870 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that “individuals have\na right protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or\nFourteenth Amendments in the privacy of personal medical\ninformation and records.”); Doe, 941 F.2d at 795-96 (holding\nthat an individual has privacy interest in medical information,\nincluding diagnosis); Caesar v. Mountanos, 542 F.2d 1064,\n1067 n.9 (9th Cir. 1976) (noting that the right to privacy\nencompasses the doctor-patient relationship). As we have\nobserved, “[o]ne can think of few subject areas more personal\nand more likely to implicate privacy interests . . . .” Norman-\nBloodsaw, 135 F.3d at 1269.\n\n  If there were any doubt, the Supreme Court held in Fergu-\nson v. City of Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 78 (2001), that indi-\nviduals enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy in\nmedical test results and that “the results of those tests will not\nbe shared with nonmedical personnel without [the patient’s]\nconsent.”\n\n   Congress has also recognized the importance of privacy in\nmedical records in a variety of contexts, most prominently in\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of\n1996 (“HIPAA”), Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996).11\n  11\n    HIPAA was far from Congress’s first foray into privacy protection. As\nthe United States Department of Heath and Human Services noted:\n       In the 1970s, individual privacy was paramount in the passage of\n       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (1970), the Privacy Act (1974), the\n       Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974), and the Right\n       to Financial Privacy Act (1978). These key laws were followed\n       in the next decade by another series of statutes, including the Pri-\n       vacy Protection Act (1980), the Electronic Communications Pri-\n       vacy Act (1986), the Video Privacy Protection Act (1988), and\n       the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (1988). In the last ten\n       years, Congress and the President have passed additional legal\n       privacy protection through, among others, the Telephone Con-\n       sumer Protection Act (1991), the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act\n       (1994), the Telecommunications Act (1996), the Children’s\n       Online Privacy Protection Act (1998), the Identity Theft and\n\f1178      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nIn the regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA, the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\nemphasized the importance of maintaining the privacy of\nmedical information, concluding that “[p]rivacy is a funda-\nmental right” and that “[a] right to privacy in personal infor-\nmation has historically found expression in American law.”12\n65 Fed.Reg. at 82,464.\n\n   In sum, given controlling legal authority, there is no ques-\ntion that the baseball players who participated in the random\ntesting had a justified expectation of privacy in the test results\nand, in particular, that the test results would not be disclosed.13\n\n    Assumption Deterrence Act (1998), and Title V of the Gramm-\n    Leach-Bliley Act (1999) governing financial privacy.\n       In 1997, a Presidential advisory commission, the Advisory\n    Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health\n    Care Industry, recognized the need for patient privacy protection\n    in its recommendations for a Consumer Bill of Rights and\n    Responsibilities (November 1997). In 1997, Congress enacted the\n    Balanced Budget Act (Public Law 105-34), which added lan-\n    guage to the Social Security Act (18 U.S.C. 1852) to require\n    Medicare+Choice organizations to establish safeguards for the\n    privacy of individually identifiable patient information. Similarly,\n    the Veterans Benefits section of the U.S. Code provides for confi-\n    dentiality of medical records in cases involving drug abuse, alco-\n    holism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell anemia (38\n    U.S.C. § 7332).\nStandards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, 65\nFed.Reg. 82,462, 82,469 (Dec. 28, 2000) (codified at former 45 C.F.R. pts.\n160, 164 (2002)).\n   12\n      The Department also emphasized that “While privacy is one of the\nkey values on which our society is built, it is more than an end in itself.\nIt is also necessary for the effective delivery of health care, both to indi-\nviduals and to populations. . . . The need for privacy of health information,\nin particular, has long been recognized as critical to the delivery of needed\nmedical care.” 65 Fed.Reg. at 82,467.\n   13\n      That the athletes had a justified, reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe urine samples themselves that were seized by the government is\nbeyond question. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489\nU.S. 602, 615-617 (1989) (“it is clear that the collection and testing of\nurine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recog-\nnized as reasonable . . . .”).\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1179\n   Of course, under appropriate circumstances, justified pri-\nvacy expectations may be altered by contract. Yin, 95 F.3d at\n872. In this instance, the ballplayers’ privacy expectations\nwere heightened, not diminished, by the collective bargaining\nagreement between the Major League Baseball Players Asso-\nciation and Major League Baseball. The agreement was\nforged after years of impasse concerning steroid testing and,\nas I have discussed, called for anonymous testing to determine\nthe scope of the steroid abuse problem. To that end, the agree-\nment provided, in relevant part that:\n\n    1. During the 2003 season (which shall include\n    spring training but not include the post-season), all\n    Players will be subject to two tests (one initial test\n    and one follow-up test conducted not less than five\n    and not more than seven days following the initial\n    test) at unannounced times for the presence of\n    Schedule III steroids (“Survey Testing”). In addition\n    the Office of Commissioner shall have the right to\n    conduct additional Survey Testing in 2003 in which\n    up to 240 players, selected at random, may be tested.\n\n    2. If the results of the Survey Testing conducted in\n    2003 show that more than 5% of Players tested test\n    positive for Steroids, all Players will be subject to\n    two unannounced tests (an initial test and a followup\n    test five to seven days later) for Steroids during the\n    2004 season (“Program Testing”). If a Player tests\n    positive in the Program Testing, he shall immedi-\n    ately be placed on the Clinical Track and shall be\n    subject to discipline for further violations. The Pro-\n    gram Testing shall continue each season until less\n    than 2.5% of the Players tested test positive for Ste-\n    roids for two consecutive seasons combined.\n\n   In short, the only objective of the 2003 testing was to ascer-\ntain whether the threshold had been exceeded; it was not\nintended to test and monitor individual baseball players.\n\f1180    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nIndeed, the testing protocol was designed to prevent the iden-\ntification of individual players and the matching of players\nwith test results. The record does not reflect whether any indi-\nvidual player was even informed of his testing results for the\n2003 sample year.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement contains numerous\nprovisions assuring confidentiality. For example, the section\nconcerning the testing protocol provides:\n\n       The confidentiality of the Player’s participation in\n    the Program is essential to the Program’s success.\n    Except as provided in Section 8, the Office of the\n    Commissioner, the Association, HPAC, Club per-\n    sonnel, and all of their members, affiliates, agents,\n    consultants and employees are prohibited from pub-\n    licly disclosing information about the Player’s test\n    results, Initial Evaluation, diagnosis, Treatment Pro-\n    gram (including whether a Player is on either the\n    Clinical or Administrative Track), prognosis or com-\n    pliance with the Program.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement specified in great\ndetail the manner of collection of data and, in particular pro-\nvided that:\n\n    At the conclusion of any Survey Test, and after the\n    results of all tests have been calculated, all test\n    results, including any identifying characteristics, will\n    be destroyed in a process jointly supervised by the\n    Office of the Commissioner and the Association.\n\n   The record contains many more references to the assurance\ngiven Major League Baseball players that the 2003 tests\nwould be anonymous and kept confidential, which are unnec-\nessary to detail. There simply is no doubt whatsoever that the\nplayers had a justified, constitutionally protected privacy\ninterest in the test results — an interest that was further\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1181\nenhanced by the many protections and contractual obligations\ncontained in the collective bargaining agreement under which\nthe tests were conducted.\n\n   In sum, the players had a significant privacy interest in the\nmedical records and physical specimens. There is no doubt\nthat the players have an individual interest in and a need for\nthe property to be returned. Thus, the second Ramsden factor\nis satisfied.\n\n                               C\n\n   I agree with the majority and the district courts that the\nplayers would be irreparably injured by denying the return of\nproperty. As the majority notes, the government has already\nconceded that the players have no adequate remedy at law for\nthe redress of their grievances. Therefore, the third and fourth\nRamsden factors are satisfied.\n\n   For these reasons, I agree with the majority that the district\ncourts properly exercised equitable jurisdiction. However, I\nwould hold that the district courts correctly found that all four\nRamsden factors were satisfied. I disagree with the majority\nthat the government’s actions properly respected the privacy\nrights of the players.\n\n                               V\n\n   We review a district court’s decision to exercise its equita-\nble jurisdiction under Rule 41(g) under the deferential abuse\nof discretion standard. Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 324. I not only fail\nto see any abuse of discretion in the decision by the district\ncourts to exercise equitable jurisdiction, I agree entirely with\ntheir conclusions that the seized property should be returned.\n\n  The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1989 amendments to\nRule 41(g) tell us that “reasonableness under all of the cir-\ncumstances” should be the governing standard for determin-\n\f1182      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ning whether property should be returned. (emphasis added).\nThose same notes state that “[i]f the United States has a need\nfor the property in an investigation or prosecution, its reten-\ntion of the property generally is reasonable,” but that “in cer-\ntain circumstances . . . equitable considerations might justify\nrequiring the government to return or destroy all copies.” Id.14\n\n   Deciding between the two hinges on “whether the Govern-\nment’s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible in this case to\nwarrant this sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327. As the actions\nI have discussed make clear, the government’s behavior was\nsufficiently reprehensible and the privacy interests of the\nplayers who were neither named in the warrant nor implicated\nin any criminal activity are sufficiently important to affirm the\ngranting of the 41(g) motions. Simply put, there is no reason\nfor the government to retain confidential medical information\nand bodily fluids of citizens who are not under any particular-\nized suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n                                    VI\n\n   For similar reasons, I would also affirm Judge Illston’s\ndecision to quash the May 6, 2004, subpoenas. The majority\ncontends that Judge Illston abused her discretion by resting\nher decision to quash the subpoenas on legally insufficient\ngrounds, citing In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Dec. 10,\n1987, 926 F.2d 847 (9th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that\nsubpoenas and search warrants serve different purposes and\ntherefore arguing that it cannot be considered an abuse to use\nboth methods of obtaining information. However, in this case,\n  14\n     The cases the majority cites for the proposition that return of property\nis inappropriate when the government still needs it as evidence are hardly\nanalogous to the present case. In both United States v. Mills, 991 F.2d 609,\n612-13 (9th Cir. 1993), and United States v. Fitzen, 80 F.3d 387, 388-89\n(9th Cir. 1996), the person seeking return of the property was the criminal\ndefendant himself, not an innocent third party, and the court found in both\ncases that the defendants didn’t even have a legitimate claim of ownership\nto the property.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1183\nthe government’s conduct went beyond seeking warrants and\nsubpoenas for the same information at the same time. As dis-\ncussed previously, the government alternately sought subpoe-\nnas and warrants to obtain highly sensitive information from\nevery Major League Baseball player and to continue to keep\nthat information after being ordered to return it. Further, as\npreviously noted, there were no substantiated risks justifying\nthe use of a warrant to obtain the documentary evidence from\na third party under 28 C.F.R. § 59.1(b).\n\n   In addition, it is worth noting that the May 6 subpoenas\nrequested much of the same information sought in the April\n30 and prior search warrants. The affidavit to obtain the April\n30 search warrant from Judge Lloyd averred that the material\nwas necessary in part because the records may “establish a\nlink to the charged defendants in this case.” It is an abuse of\nthe grand jury process to use grand jury subpoenas to develop\npost-indictment trial material. See, e.g., In Re Grand Jury\nSubpoena Duces Tecum Dated January 2, 1985 (Simels), 767\nF.2d 26, 29 (2d Cir. 1985) (timing of subpoena, first issued\nafter indictment, suggested that its purpose was to obtain trial\nmaterial). The Balco indictments were returned in February.\nTherefore, the issuance of the May 6 grand jury subpoena,\nfollowing on the heels of the search warrant application for\nthe same information indicating that its partial purpose was to\ndevelop links to Balco, suggests an abuse of grand jury pro-\ncess.\n\n   Given the history of this case, the district court’s conclu-\nsion that the filing of these subpoenas was “the culmination\nof a series of actions taken by the government in order to pre-\nvent the MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to move to quash the\nJanuary and March subpoenas” is fully supported by the\nrecord and certainly cannot be said to be an abuse of discre-\ntion.\n\n                              VII\n\n  Although I have detailed why I believe the findings and\nconclusions of the district court should be sustained on\n\f1184      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nappeal, I cannot leave the matter at hand without discussing\nthe larger implications of this case.\n\n                                    A\n\n   The principle at stake in this case is relevant in countless\nmodern scenarios in which data responsive to a warrant is\nintermingled with private, unresponsive data. The result of the\nmajority’s holding is that the government has been permitted\nto seize confidential medical information pertaining to indi-\nviduals not under any criminal suspicion. The majority’s\nholding that the government was entitled to seize all records\nin computerized files and subsequently search the records\nwithout probable cause puts Americans’ most basic privacy\ninterests in jeopardy. Approving of the tactics employed here\nwould entitle the government to seize the medical records of\nanyone who had the misfortune of visiting a hospital or\nbelonging to a health care provider that kept patient records\nin any sort of master file which also contained the data of a\nperson whose information was subject to a search warrant. I\nagree entirely with Judge Illston’s observation that the impli-\ncations of approving such behavior are staggering. Under the\nmajority’s holding, no laboratory or hospital or health care\nfacility could guarantee the confidentiality of records.15\n   15\n      This is why, even when large sets of data need to be sorted to find\nmaterial responsive to a warrant, that task is assigned to a computer spe-\ncialist and not the agents tasked with conducting the investigation. The\nmajority fails to see the relevance of this role division, but it is evident\nhere. Had a computer specialist sorted the data as prescribed by the war-\nrant, it is unlikely he or she would have extracted non-responsive records\nand then used them to apply for further warrants seeking access to test\nresults beyond the scope of the initial investigation. Instead, Agent\nNovitzsky, who was tasked with leading the investigation, viewed material\nhe was not supposed to see and used it for purposes for which the warrant\nwas never initially intended. If the warrant had intended to authorize any\nagent to examine the intermingled data, it would not have gone out of its\nway to specify that only certain agents were permitted to engage in that\ntask.\n\f            UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                  1185\n  The majority attempts to discount this possibility, but offers\nno principled reason why it does not apply in hundreds of\nother contexts. Indeed, under questioning from the district\njudges, the government itself did not discount the possibility\nof other widespread searches.16\n  16\n     For example, a hearing before Magistrate Judge Johnson contained the\nfollowing colloquy between government counsel and the Court:\n       Court:     * * * If there is some other drug testing lab apart\n                  from CDT, would you ever use — but the test for the\n                  ten were at CDT. Would you ever use this informa-\n                  tion to go and say — just demand that you can get the\n                  drug testing results from other labs that test profes-\n                  sional athletes. . . . Based on the theory that it’s sys-\n                  temic. And so there’s a problem, there’s a problem.\n                  And we know that these other labs test athletes, too.\n                  So can you just go search?\n       Counsel:   Yes, your honor.\n   Similarly, in another hearing Judge Illston asked government counsel\nwhether he thought it was possible to take the information from the Tracey\ndirectory concerning other sports organizations and use individual test\nresults of athletes to launch another investigation. Strikingly, Judge Illston\nposed it as a hypothetical, but the government did not appear to deny that\nofficers may have viewed individual records in other sports:\n       Court:     What if hockey had a subdirectory that had positive\n                  results and he clicked on it to make sure it was what\n                  it said it was, by George, that’s what it was, what\n                  about that?\n       Counsel:   I don’t know in checking to make sure it was hockey\n                  that didn’t happen. If it did happen, I would think that\n                  theoretically Agent Novitsky would have the right to\n                  either request a search warrant or, I suppose, if you\n                  looked at it enough, it’s possible that it was obvious,\n                  it was plain view, it was other drug use by hockey\n                  players. So there might be a legal entitlement for\n                  Agent Novitzsky to use that and do something with\n                  it. It hasn’t happened in this case. I suppose that’s\n                  theoretically possible, again, you would have, I\n                  believe, probable cause to believe that evidence in\n                  there would lead to other persons potentially involved\n                  in disputable criminal drugs, which is the crime that’s\n                  under investigation.\n\f1186    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The importance of this threat to our nation’s medical com-\nmunity cannot be overstated. In order to provide better and\nmore efficient heath care, doctors and hospitals have rapidly\nembraced a variety of methods for sharing confidential patient\ninformation electronically. Computerized physician order\nentry, for example, allows doctors to transmit treatment\ninstructions widely throughout a health care computer net-\nwork so that nurses, therapists, pharmacists, radiologists and\npathologists have instant and accurate access to the instruc-\ntions. Computerized electronic record transmission decreases\ndelay, reduces costs, and minimizes errors. But it does involve\nextensive electronic co-mingling of patient data throughout\ncomputer networks.\n\n   Likewise, mass electronic transmission and storage of con-\nfidential medical records is now ingrained in the health insur-\nance industry. Electronic access allows more efficient and\ntimely determination and payment of medical insurance bene-\nfits.\n\n   The federal government has taken an affirmative role in\npromoting national patient data access. In 2004, for example,\nthe President created the Office of National Coordinator for\nHealth Information Technology in order to develop and\nimplement a nationwide infrastructure to allow the communi-\ncation and exchange of health care data between different\ninformation technology systems. Executive Order 13335,\n2004 WL 911114 (Pres.Exec.Order), 69 FR 24059 (2004).\n\n   The simple fact is that the majority of confidential medical\ninformation in the United States consists, in one fashion or\nanother, of co-mingled electronic data. To endorse the gov-\nernment’s position that probable cause as to one patient’s\nrecords justifies the seizure of all co-mingled records would\nmean that the Fourth Amendment does not afford any mean-\ningful protection at all for our citizens’ most private informa-\ntion.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1187\n                                B\n\n   As the Players Association and Amicus Chamber of Com-\nmerce have effectively argued, today’s decision will also sig-\nnificantly impair the ability of employers to promote\nvoluntary drug testing in the workplace. Employers are not\npermitted unilaterally to impose workplace drug testing on\nemployees subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\nUnited Foods & Commercial Workers v. Foster Poultry\nFarms, 74 F.3d 169, 174 (9th Cir. 1995) (“there is no indica-\ntion in the relevant statutes, the legislative history, or the reg-\nulations themselves that the drug testing requirements were\nintended to preempt already existing collective bargaining\nagreements or to eliminate an employer’s duty to bargain\nunder federal labor laws.”). If the government may violate the\nconfidentiality promised employees in collective bargaining\nagreements without any suspicion of criminal activity and\nsimply seize confidential test records in the hope of finding\nincriminating information, no sensible union will agree to\nallow its employees to be tested. Therefore, although the gov-\nernment proceeds here under an apparent mission to root out\nall steroid use in baseball, and perhaps other sports, the result\nof its tactics will be quite the opposite. Without mandatory\ntesting, any steroid policy will be but an empty aspirational\ngoal. If today’s decision stands, it is difficult to imagine any\nsports union agreeing to drug testing in collective bargaining\nnegotiations. The implications for employee testing in all\nindustries are obvious.\n\n                                C\n\n   Finally, today’s decision marks the return of the prohibited\ngeneral warrant through an endorsement of a disguised imper-\nmissible general search warrant—a tactic we rejected in\nUnited States v. Rettig, 589 F.2d 418 (9th Cir. 1978). Indeed,\nas the Supreme Court has observed, “[i]t is familiar history\nthat indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the\nauthority of ‘general warrants’ were the immediate evils that\n\f1188    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nmotivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amend-\nment.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 583 (1980). It was\nfor this reason that the particularity requirement in warrants\nwas adopted. As the Court noted in Maryland v. Garrison,\n480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987):\n\n    The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment cate-\n    gorically prohibits the issuance of any warrant\n    except one “particularly describing the place to be\n    searched and the persons or things to be seized.” The\n    manifest purpose of this particularity requirement\n    was to prevent general searches. By limiting the\n    authorization to search to the specific areas and\n    things for which there is probable cause to search,\n    the requirement ensures that the search will be care-\n    fully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on\n    the character of the wide-ranging exploratory\n    searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\n\n  The majority allows the government to circumvent these\nimportant Fourth Amendment principles by allowing the gov-\nernment to use boilerplate computer search language in a war-\nrant to justify the seizure and subsequent warrantless search\nof massive amounts of data not responsive to the warrant. In\ndoing so, the majority has allowed the government with the\nwave of a computer curser to transform a limited search war-\nrant into an impermissible general warrant.\n\n                              VIII\n\n   I also cannot leave our consideration of this case without\naddressing the actual argument made by the government in\njustifying its actions. The government did not advocate the\nposition adopted by the majority. The government’s sole justi-\nfication for the warrantless seizure of the data of the unlisted\nplayers is that it was in “plain view,” which is one of the lim-\nited exceptions to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant require-\nment. Although the majority did not reach this question, the\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1189\ntheory formed the entire basis for the government’s legal jus-\ntification for its actions and was the primary focus of the pro-\nceedings before the district courts. Therefore, it is important\nto address it to demonstrate the soundness of the various deci-\nsions by the district courts.\n\n   The plain view doctrine is based on the assumption that if\nthere is probable cause for the search, and the officer is\nlegally entitled to be at the premises under the Fourth Amend-\nment, seizure of an object in plain view that is contraband or\nevidence of a crime does not involve an invasion of privacy.\nPayton, 445 U.S. at 586-87. The Supreme Court has identified\nseveral conditions that must be satisfied before a plain view\nseizure of an object is upheld: (1) the officer conducting the\nseizure must lawfully arrive at the position from which the\nobject is plainly seen; (2) the object must be in plain view; (3)\nthe object’s incriminating character must be “immediately\napparent,” that is, the officer must have probable cause to\nbelieve the object is contraband or evidence of a crime; and\n(4) the officer must have a lawful right of access to the object\nitself. Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993);\nHorton, 496 U.S. at 136-37; Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730,\n737 (1983).\n\n   Under the circumstances presented by this case, not only is\nit clear that the government had not met its burden of estab-\nlishing that the seizure of the data was justified under the\nplain view doctrine, but it is also clear why the plain view\ndoctrine would be inappropriate to apply in the computer con-\ntext.\n\n                               A\n\n   The fundamental requirement of the plain view doctrine is\nthat the object seized be in “plain view,” that is, “obvious to\nthe senses.” United States v. Sifuentes, 504 F.2d 845, 848 (4th\nCir. 1974). After an extensive colloquy, Judge Illston con-\ncluded that the computer data seized was not in “plain view.”\n\f1190    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nNot only is this factual conclusion not clearly erroneous, the\nundisputed record completely supports her conclusion under\nany standard of review.\n\n   As Judge Illston pointed out, this was not a case in which\nan incriminating photo or similar evidence could be viewed\non a computer screen; rather, at best, it involved scrolling\nthrough thousands of records none of which were immedi-\nately visible. In its application for a search warrant, the gov-\nernment justified removal of data and computer equipment on\nthe basis that:\n\n    The volume of data stored on many computer sys-\n    tems and storage devices will typically be so large\n    that it will be highly impractical to search for data\n    during the execution of the physical search of the\n    premises. A single megabyte of storage space is the\n    equivalent of 500 double-spaced pages of text. A\n    single gigabyte of storage space, or 1,000\n    megabytes, is the equivalent of 500,000 double-\n    spaced pages of text. Storage devices capable of\n    storing fifteen gigabytes of data are now common-\n    place in desktop computers. Consequently, each non-\n    networked desktop computer found during a search\n    can easily contain the equivalent of 7.5 million pages\n    of data, which, if printed out, would completely fill\n    a 10’ x 12’ x 10’ room to the ceiling.\n\n  The government also indicated in its affidavit that it would\nbe using consulting computer specialists to analyze the data.\nThe affidavit explained:\n\n    Searching computer systems is highly technical pro-\n    cess which requires specific expertise and special-\n    ized equipment. There are so many types of\n    computer hardware and software in use today that it\n    is impractical to bring to the search site all of the\n    necessary technical manuals and specialized equip-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1191\n    ment to conduct a thorough search. In addition, it\n    may also be necessary to consult with computer per-\n    sonnel who have specific expertise in the type of\n    computer software application or operating system\n    that is being searched.\n\n   According to the government, the search of the computers\nat CDT could not be completed at the scene. There were, in\nfact, 16 computers. However, one computer was eventually\nisolated and data retrieved. As Special Agent Novitsky’s\nmemorandum of activity stated:\n\n    At approximately 2:35 p.m., S/A Abboud began\n    working on a computer with [a CDT employee].\n    [She] directed us to a computer in the office labeled\n    “E” for purposes of the search warrant and sketch.\n    At this computer, [she] identified a sub-directory\n    entitled “Tracey”, which she said contained all of the\n    computer documents for CDT’s sports drug testing\n    division. A cursory review of the subdirectory indi-\n    cated multiple further subdirectories and several\n    hundred computer files. As authorized by the war-\n    rant, because of the length of time it would take to\n    search each file and the intrusiveness it would cause\n    on CDT, it was decided to make a complete copy of\n    the “Tracey” subdirectory in order to perform a\n    search of it in the IRS-CID offices at a later time.\n\n   Agent Novitsky later explained in a subsequent affidavit\nthat:\n\n    This subdirectory contained hundreds of files and a\n    significant amount of computer data. After consult-\n    ing with agents at the scene specifically trained in\n    the search of computers, we determined that we\n    could not realistically search the entire directory on-\n    site in a reasonable amount of time. We therefore\n\f1192    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    made the determination to copy the entire sub-\n    directory.\n\n   After it was examined, the Tracey directory itself was\ndetermined to contain 2,911 files, with an unknown amount\nof data in each file, that were not connected with Major\nLeague Baseball player drug testing at all. In the files that\nconcerned Major League Baseball players, there was informa-\ntion on approximately 1,200 players, with multiple test\nresults.\n\n   Given these circumstances, the data seized cannot be con-\nsidered to be in “plain view.” As the Supreme Court has\nnoted, “If, however, the police lack probable cause to believe\nthat an object in plain view is contraband without conducting\nsome further search of the object — i.e., if its incriminating\ncharacter is not immediately apparent, the plain view doctrine\ncannot justify its seizure.” Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 375 (alter-\nations and quotations omitted). The data now sought by the\ngovernment was not “obvious to the senses” at the scene, nor\nwere the positive tests in “plain view” from a glance at a com-\nputer screen. The data required analysis and thorough exami-\nnation off-site before the data at issue was discovered.\n\n   The “plain view” doctrine is inapplicable in the general\nelectronic context because it is at complete odds with the\nunderlying theory of the doctrine. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained:\n\n    The theory of that doctrine consists of extending to\n    nonpublic places such as the home, where searches\n    and seizures without a warrant are presumptively\n    unreasonable, the police’s longstanding authority to\n    make warrantless seizures in public places of such\n    objects as weapons and contraband. And the practi-\n    cal justification for that extension is the desirability\n    of sparing police, whose viewing of the object in the\n    course of a lawful search is as legitimate as it would\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1193\n    have been in a public place, the inconvenience and\n    risk—to themselves or to preservation of the\n    evidence—of going to obtain a warrant.\n\nHorton, 480 U.S. at 326-27 (internal citations omitted).\n\n   Neither of those considerations is present when we consider\nthe off-site examination of electronic data. As the government\nessentially acknowledged in its search warrant applications,\nexamination of computer data is a forensic exercise. It neces-\nsarily involves the application of software to interpret the\ndata; without external software aid, the data would appear\nonly as binary numbers. In addition, as in this case, the gov-\nernment often requires computer specialists to decipher the\ndata. Electronic data is simply not the kind of evidence that\nforms a natural extension of an officer’s discovery of obvious\ncontraband in a public place. The fact that further careful\nelectronic assistance is required outside the searched premises\nto interpret the data belies the “practical” justification that\nthere is insufficient time to obtain a warrant. Indeed, electron-\nically assisted searches of binary numbers bear a closer\nresemblance to the thermal imaging searches of homes that\nthe Supreme Court rejected as violative of the Fourth Amend-\nment in Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001).\n\n  The ultimate fact that, after the assistance of electronic soft-\nware programs, the data may be observed “in plain view”\ndoes not alter this conclusion. As the Supreme Court has\nwarned:\n\n    [I]n the vast majority of cases, any evidence seized\n    by the police will be in plain view, at least at the\n    moment of seizure. The problem with the “plain\n    view” doctrine has been to identify the circum-\n    stances in which plain view has legal significance\n    rather than being simply the normal concomitant of\n    any search, legal or illegal.\n\f1194    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nCoolidge, 403 U.S. at 465.\n\n   The off-site forensic examination of computer data is sim-\nply not one of those circumstances that fits the “plain view”\nparadigm. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to write out the\nFourth Amendment’s particularity requirement with respect to\nelectronic data and to transform particularized search warrants\ninto general search warrants, with the government authorized\nto conduct indiscriminate, dragnet searches.\n\n                               B\n\n   The government also failed to sustain its burden to estab-\nlish the plain view exception because, as the district courts\nfound, the incriminating character of the information was not\n“immediately apparent.” It was clear under the testing proto-\ncol that positive tests did not necessarily reflect steroid use;\nthe use of nutritional supplements—which is common in pro-\nfessional sports—could yield a false positive. In addition,\nthere are a whole host of legitimate reasons for individuals to\nbe prescribed steroid products. The CDT testing was not\nundertaken to test individual players; but rather to provide a\nsurvey for the possible establishment of an individual drug\ntesting protocol.\n\n   The government relied on sheer speculation that the pres-\nence of positive steroid markers would mean that the athlete\nhad received steroids without prescription from some\nunknown person. The crime that the government was inter-\nested in pursuing was the illegal distribution of steroids. The\nevidence of a positive test was not affirmative evidence of any\ndistribution. The government’s theory was that, armed with\nthe test results, the government could then summon the athlete\nbefore a grand jury to see if it could obtain evidence from\nwhom and under what circumstances the athlete may have\nobtained steroids.\n\n   However, the mere suspicion of criminal activity or the sus-\npicion of knowledge of a criminal activity is not sufficient to\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1195\nsustain a seizure of evidence under the plain view doctrine.\nAs the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear, the “imme-\ndiately apparent” requirement means that the law enforcement\nofficer must have probable cause to seize the property that the\nofficer observed in plain view. As the Court explained:\n\n    We now hold that probable cause is required. To say\n    otherwise would be to cut the “plain view” doctrine\n    loose from its theoretical and practical moorings. . . .\n    Dispensing with the need for a warrant is worlds\n    apart from permitting a lesser standard of cause for\n    the seizure than a warrant would require, i.e., the\n    standard of probable cause. No reason is apparent\n    why an object should routinely be seizable on lesser\n    grounds, during an unrelated search and seizure, than\n    would have been needed to obtain a warrant for that\n    same object if it had been known to be on the prem-\n    ises.\n\nArizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 326-27 (1987).\n\n   The government conceded that it did not have probable\ncause to search or seize any data or specimens beyond what\nwas relevant to the ten players listed in the warrant. For those\nplayers, the government provided extensive information\nshowing their alleged connection to Balco. However, the gov-\nernment conceded that it had no information connecting any\nof the other players to Balco. Indeed, it made that clear in\nboth its affidavits and subsequent hearings. The affidavit pro-\nvided to Judge Lloyd speculated that evidence might be\ndeveloped linking the players who tested positive to Balco\n“because of the closely-knit professional baseball communi-\nty,” but also speculated that the positive test results could sug-\ngest “another significant source of illegal performance-\nenhancing drugs.” In fact, the government tendered no evi-\ndence whatsoever in support of either theory. The government\ndid not have any information concerning who might be\n\f1196        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ninvolved in any distribution scheme; in fact, it had no idea at\nall.17\n\n   The government did not submit any evidence contradicting\nthe affidavits indicating the possibility of false positives and\nthat a positive result did not necessarily indicate illegal steroid\nuse. There was no specific target of the investigation against\nwhom the government sought incriminating evidence.\n\n   Mere speculation is not sufficient to establish probable\ncause. United States v. Howard, 828 F.2d 552, 555 (9th Cir.\n1987). Perhaps the government had reasonable suspicion, but\nthat is not sufficient to justify a seizure under the plain view\ndoctrine. See Hicks, 480 U.S. at 326 (holding that “probable\ncause is required”); Payton, 445 U.S. at 587 (explaining the\nplain view requirement that there be “probable cause to asso-\nciate the property with criminal activity.”).\n\n  The government’s plain view theory cannot justify its\nactions in this case.\n\n                                     IX\n\n   I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the media has\nstanding on appeal to file a motion to unseal records. I also\nagree that, under the circumstances presented by this case, the\nmotion should be referred to the district courts on remand.\n\n   I write separately to comment on what I view as a regretta-\nble effort by both parties in the district courts to circumvent\n  17\n    For example, the government engaged in the following colloquy at\none hearing:\n       Counsel:   Your honor, it’s evidence because it’s evidence of an\n                  illegal distribution of steroids to other people.\n       Court:     From where?\n       Counsel:   From where? That’s an excellent question, and that is\n                  why we need the evidence.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1197\nthe procedures we have established to balance the First\nAmendment rights of the press with the confidentiality that is\nrequired for some criminal proceedings.18 Specifically, I note\nthat all of the district court proceedings were closed by insis-\ntence of the parties, without notice to the press or public.\n\n   In some instances, courtroom closures were obtained with-\nout prior notice to the district court itself. For example, the\ntranscript of one of the hearings before one of the district\ncourt judges reflects the following colloquy:\n\n       Court:    Why is that, that you are locking the door?\n\n       Clerk:    Since the case was filed under seal.\n\n       Court:    Is this all under seal? * * * You want the\n                 hearings under seal. There was no motion\n                 made to seal the hearing. I wasn’t aware\n                 you wanted it that way.\n\n       Counsel: Your honor, we filed the pleadings under\n                seal. We think this proceeding should be\n                under seal. The information at issue is\n                highly confidential.\n\n   After some colloquy, the court allowed the courtroom to be\nsealed, but admonished counsel to file an appropriate motion\nif they wished any further courtroom proceedings to be closed\nin the future. However, neither the public nor the press were\nnotified that the doors were to be locked and the public\nbarred.\n\n  “Under the first amendment, the press and the public have\na presumed right of access to court proceedings and docu-\n  18\n    The government and the Players Association also sought to have oral\nargument in the court of appeals closed to the public. We denied that\nmotion, and a subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n\f1198     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nments.” Oregonian Pub. Co. v. District Court, 920 F.2d 1462,\n1465 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior\nCourt, 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1985)(“Press-Enterprise I”)). “This\npresumed right can be overcome only by an overriding right\nor interest ‘based on findings that closure is essential to pre-\nserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that\ninterest.’ ” Id. (quoting Press-Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 510)\n\n   In determining questions of public and press access to the\ncourts, courts are to examine whether a right attaches to a par-\nticular proceeding, using the Supreme Court’s “logic and\nexperience” test articulated in Press-Enterprise v. Superior\nCourt of California for the County of Riverside, 478 U.S. 1,\n8-9 (1986) (“Press-Enterprise II”). “If a proceeding fulfills\nboth parts of the test, a qualified First Amendment right of\naccess arises, to be overcome ‘only by an overriding interest\nbased on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher\nvalues and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.’ ” Phoe-\nnix Newspapers, Inc. v. District Court, 156 F.3d 940, 946 (9th\nCir. 1998) (quoting Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9-10).\nProvisions for narrow tailoring may include later release of\ntranscripts, or redacted transcripts. Id. at 947.19 In making its\ndecision to close proceedings, “[t]he trial court must articulate\nthis interest ‘along with findings specific enough that a\nreviewing court can determine whether the closure order was\nproperly entered.’ ” Id. at 946-47. None of these procedural\nsteps were undertaken in the district courts.\n\n   To be sure, the right of access to court proceedings is not\nabsolute. Id. at 946. Both parties have legitimate privacy\ninterests to protect. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nrequire “matters affecting a grand jury proceeding to be\nclosed to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters\noccurring before a grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(5). In\naddition, as I have discussed, the athletes represented by the\n  19\n    Indeed, transcripts of court proceedings “must be released when the\nfactors militating in favor of closure no longer exist.” Id. at 947-48.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1199\nPlayers Association have a very strong privacy interest in\ntheir medical records. However, there are non-grand jury\nmaterials involved in this case, and there are some proceed-\nings that do not appear to have involved confidential material.20\n\n   In any case, these are matters best considered in the first\ninstance by the district court, with public notice so that the\nFirst Amendment right of access may be balanced with the\nprivacy interests of the parties. Unfortunately, the parties\npresented hearing closure and record sealing as a fait accom-\npli to the district courts, without notice to the press or public.\nNow that we have remanded the motion to unseal, this issue\nmay be addressed.\n\n                                    X\n\n   In discussions of the use of alleged use of steroids by base-\nball players, much is made about “the integrity of the game.”\nEven more important is the integrity of our legal system. Per-\nhaps baseball has become consumed by a “Game of Shadows,”21\nbut that is no reason for the government to engage in a “Pros-\necution of Shadows.” The district judges were entirely right\nto order the government to return the thousands of private\nmedical records it wrongfully seized by use of pretext and\nartifice.\n\n   I would affirm the orders of the district court and must\n  20\n      The government, in at least one proceeding, seemed to indicate that\nit might not oppose unsealing some material, with government counsel\nstating before Judge Mahan: “As a matter of DOJ regulation and policy,\nwe actually have taken the position and we do take the position that there\nisn’t a need to have these proceedings actually sealed, and that is because\nof the paramount interest in having actual public proceedings in court-\nrooms held in public.” However, the government did not object formally\nto sealing the transcript of that hearing, and the transcript has, to date,\nbeen sealed.\n   21\n      Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, Game of Shadows (2006).\n\f1200    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nrespectfully dissent from the majority’s contrary conclusion.\nI concur in the remand of the motion to unseal records.\n\f",

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                              OPINION\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n  We must decide whether the United States may retain evi-\ndence it seized from Major League Baseball’s drug testing\nadministrator, and enforce an additional subpoena, as part of\nan ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal steroid use by\nprofessional athletes.\n\n                                    I\n\n   These three consolidated cases arise from the federal inves-\ntigation of the Bay Area Lab Cooperative (“Balco”) and its\nalleged distribution of illegal steroids to enhance the perfor-\nmance of professional baseball athletes. The investigation\nbegan in August 2002 and, over the following several years,\nproduced evidence—including grand jury testimony—\nestablishing probable cause to believe that at least 10 major\nleague baseball players received illegal steroids from Balco.\nToday we decide the government’s appeals from the separate\nadverse orders of three different district courts: (1) an order\nby Judge Florence-Marie Cooper in the Central District of\nCalifornia, denying reconsideration of her earlier order requir-\ning the government to return property seized from Compre-\nhensive Drug Testing, Inc. in Long Beach, California (“CDT”),1\n(2) an order by Judge James Mahan in the District of Nevada,\nrequiring the government to return property seized from Quest\nDiagnostics, Inc. in Las Vegas, Nevada (“Quest”),2 and (3) an\norder by Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of Cali-\nfornia, quashing the government’s May 6, 2004, subpoenas to\nCDT and Quest that related to the grand jury sitting in San\nFrancisco, California.\n  1\n    The court also required the government to turn over all notes made by\nagents who reviewed the challenged evidence.\n  2\n    Again, the court required the government to give up all notes made by\nreviewing agents.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                   1085\n                                     A\n\n   As part of its investigation into Balco, the government in\nNovember 2003 served a grand jury subpoena on Major\nLeague Baseball (“MLB”),3 seeking drug testing information\nfor 11 players4 with connections to Balco. One month later,\nMLB responded that it had no such information.\n\n   The government then reasoned that because CDT5 and Quest6\nhad tested urine samples from MLB players during 2003,\nthose entities—rather than MLB—had to possess the samples\nand testing records in question. Therefore, the government\nissued subpoenas both to CDT and to Quest, seeking drug\ntesting information for all MLB players. The subpoenas were\nreturnable on February 5, 2004, but the government extended\nthat date to March 4, 2004, after CDT and Quest promised not\nto destroy or to alter any of the evidence requested.\n\n   Despite protracted negotiations, CDT and Quest resisted\nproducing any of the subpoenaed materials, explaining that\nthey would fight production of even a single drug test all the\n  3\n     “Major League Baseball,” an unincorporated association, consists of\ntwo professional baseball leagues—the National League of Professional\nBaseball Clubs and the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs.\n   4\n     The names of the players are under seal and are not disclosed in this\nopinion.\n   5\n     CDT is a third-party administrator of “drug and alcohol testing pro-\ngrams” that was hired to oversee MLB’s drug use evaluation program. The\ncompany includes “top experts in pharmacology, forensic toxicology,\nlaboratory management, medical review, legal, and administrative\ncompliance.” Comprehensive Drug Testing: About Us, http://\nwww.cdtsolutions.com/about_us.html (last visited June 13, 2007).\n   6\n     Quest offers laboratories that conduct “drugs of abuse testing and ther-\napeutic drug monitoring” with “the most advanced methodologies avail-\nable.” Quest Diagnostics: Diagnostic Testing & Services, http://\nwww.questdiagnostics.com/brand/business/b_bus_lab_index.html             (last\nvisited June 13, 2007). Quest’s laboratory in Las Vegas performed the\ndrug testing on the player specimens at issue in these consolidated appeals.\n\f1086      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nway to the Supreme Court. Following further negotiations, the\ngovernment, believing that a narrower subpoena might be\neffective, issued new subpoenas on March 3, 2004, seeking\ndocuments related only to eleven7 players with Balco connec-\ntions. These new subpoenas were returnable on April 8, 2004.\n\n   Two days before the new return date, the Major League\nBaseball Players’ Association—the union representing ath-\nletes who play for Major League Baseball8 —informed the\ngovernment that it intended to file a motion to quash the sub-\npoenas. The following day, as promised, CDT and the Players\nAssociation filed such a motion in the Northern District of\nCalifornia before United States District Judge Jeffrey White.\n\n                                     B\n\n   After learning of the planned motion to quash, the govern-\nment applied on April 7, 2004, for warrants to search CDT’s\nLong Beach office and Quest’s Las Vegas laboratory. The\ngovernment expected to find testing evidence at both loca-\ntions and knew that the information at CDT would be needed\nto obtain all relevant records from Quest, because Quest\nstored each testing record by code, not name, and CDT pos-\nsessed the information identifying the code(s) that corre-\nsponded to each player in its testing program. Upon a\nshowing of probable cause,9 Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Johnson\nin the Central District of California issued a search warrant\nfor the CDT office,10 and Magistrate Judge Lawrence Leavitt\n  7\n     The government later decided not to seek drug testing evidence related\nto one of the eleven players, and on April 22, 2004, sent a letter to counsel\nfor CDT withdrawing requests for documents related to that player.\n   8\n     The testing records at issue in these cases were created pursuant to a\ncollective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the\nplayers of Major League Baseball (represented by the Major League Base-\nball Players’ Association).\n   9\n     No party disputes the existence of probable cause to support the April\n7, 2004, warrants.\n   10\n      The warrant was not limited to the identifying numbers of the ten\nplayers, although those numbers were integral to obtaining meaningful\ninformation from Quest and thus played a special role in the investigation.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                  1087\nin the District of Nevada issued a search warrant for the Quest\nlaboratory.11 Affidavits submitted to support the warrants\ninformed both magistrates that the information sought was\nalready the subject of grand jury subpoenas and that a motion\nto quash was expected.12 Contrary to the arguments of the\nPlayers Association and CDT, the government did not prem-\nise its April search warrant affidavits on a claim that the evi-\ndence was in danger of being destroyed.13\n\n   The April 7 warrants authorized the seizure of drug testing\nrecords and specimens for ten named Balco-connected play-\ners, as well as “[a]ll manuals, pamphlets, booklets, contracts,\nagreements and any other materials detailing or explaining”\nCDT’s or Quest’s “administration of Major League Baseball’s\ndrug testing program.”14 The warrants also authorized the\nsearch of computer equipment, computer storage devices, and\n  11\n      Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(b) authorizes the government\nto pursue search warrants in different districts. The rule gives a magistrate\njudge the authority “to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or\nproperty located within the district,” “to issue a warrant for a person or\nproperty outside the district if the person or property is located within the\ndistrict when the warrant is issued but might move or be moved outside\nthe district before the warrant is executed,” or “in an investigation of\ndomestic terrorism or international terrorism . . . [to] issue a warrant for\na person or property within or outside that district.” Fed. R. Crim. P.\n41(b).\n   12\n      See infra pp. 1109-1110.\n   13\n      Loss of electronic evidence during delays in litigation is a consider-\nable risk. In its recent publication advising judges on how to manage elec-\ntronic discovery in civil cases, the Federal Judicial Center explained that\njudges should consider “preservation order[s]” to “minimize the risk that\nrelevant evidence will be deliberately or inadvertently destroyed” and to\n“help ensure information is retrieved when it is most accessible (i.e.,\nbefore it has been deleted or removed from active online data).” Federal\nJudicial Center, Managing Discovery of Electronic Information: A Pocket\nGuide for Judges 17 (eds. Barbara Rothstein, Ronald J. Hedges & Eliza-\nbeth C. Wiggins) (2007) [hereinafter “Managing Discovery”].\n   14\n      The warrant also expressly authorized the seizure of “correspondence”\nand “e-mails” detailing or explaining Quest’s administration of the drug\ntesting program.\n\f1088    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n—where an on site search would be impracticable—seizure of\neither a copy of all data or the computer equipment itself.\n“[L]aw enforcement personnel trained in searching and seiz-\ning computer data” (designated “computer personnel”) were\nresponsible for choosing the appropriate course of action to\ncapture the electronic data sought. If seizure of all data or\nequipment was necessary, “appropriately trained personnel”\nwould review the data, retaining the evidence authorized by\nthe warrant and designating the remainder for return.\n\n   On the morning of April 8, 2004, Special Agent Jeff\nNovitzky (the lead case agent) and eleven other federal agents\n—including Computer Investigative Specialist Agent Joseph\nAbboud—executed the search warrant for CDT’s Long Beach\noffice. Although CDT personnel were initially cooperative,\none of CDT’s directors—after speaking with counsel—\ninformed Agent Novitzky that CDT would not assist federal\nofficers in locating the evidence they were authorized to seize\nand that the agents should “do what they needed to do.” When\ninformed that agents might be forced to seize all computer\nequipment for up to sixty days, the director again contacted\ncounsel, exclaiming that such a seizure would “shut[ ] the\nbusiness down.”\n\n   Throughout the morning and early afternoon, Agent\nNovitzky spoke several times with CDT’s attorney, David\nBancroft. Bancroft asked Agent Novitzky not to seize any-\nthing while he attempted to work out a beneficial solution\nwith the United States Attorney’s Office in San Francisco.\nLater, Bancroft told the agent that CDT had only one hard-\ncopy document eligible for seizure. Around noon, both Agent\nNovitzky and Assistant United States Attorney Jeff Nedrow\nspoke with Bancroft and CDT’s directors via conference call.\nBancroft emphasized that any help CDT provided should not\nbe construed to constitute consent and then informed Nedrow\nand Agent Novitzky that CDT had two computers on which\nagents would find information relevant to the search warrant.\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING             1089\n   During this conference call, Agent Novitzky learned that\nagents had discovered a hard-copy document with names and\nidentifying numbers for all MLB players, including some of\nthe ten named Balco players. Agent Novitzky faxed the docu-\nment, which was not the “only document eligible for seizure”\nto which Bancroft had alluded, to Nedrow for preparation of\nanother search warrant to seize specimen samples from Quest\nbased on the identifying numbers. One of CDT’s directors\nbecame visibly upset when she noticed the document being\nfaxed. She left the premises, but when she returned, she\nopened a locked drawer and presented agents with a docu-\nment that contained drug test results for the ten named Balco\nplayers—the document previously described as the only seiz-\nable hard-copy document on site.15\n\n   At 2:35 p.m., a CDT director finally identified a computer\ndirectory containing all of the computer files for CDT’s sports\ndrug testing programs. This directory, labeled “Tracey,” con-\ntained numerous subdirectories and hundreds of files. Seeing\nthis, Agent Abboud recommended copying the entire direc-\ntory for off-site analysis, because of the time and intrusive-\nness involved in searching the voluminous directory on site.\nThe warrant had anticipated that such removal might be nec-\nessary, and provided:\n\n          If the computer equipment and storage devices\n       cannot be searched on-site in a reasonable amount of\n       time, then the computer personnel will determine\n       whether it is practical to copy the data during the\n       execution of the search in a reasonable amount of\n       time without jeopardizing the ability to preserve the\n       data.\n  15\n    Some time later, agents located a billing document for CDT’s off-site\nLong Beach storage locker. Only after agents obtained a fourth warrant\nfrom Magistrate Judge Johnson on April 8, 2004, allowing them to search\nand seize evidence in the locker, did a CDT director agree to open the\nlocker for the agents.\n\f1090      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nThe agents copied the directory and removed the copy for\nlater review at government offices.16\n\n   The search of the CDT facility concluded shortly after 5\np.m., but before he left the premises, Agent Novitzky\nreviewed with CDT directors the evidence seized during the\nsearch. The documents seized included a 25-page master list\nof all MLB players tested during the 2003 season and a 34-\npage list of positive drug test results for eight of the ten\nnamed Balco players, intermingled with positive results for 26\nother players.17 Upon returning to his office in San Jose, Cali-\nfornia, Agent Novitzky briefly reviewed the contents of the\nTracey directory, identifying five subdirectories related to\nMLB. Within these directories, Agent Novitzky identified\nfiles authorized by magistrate judges for seizure, including the\nmaster file of positive drug test results.\n\n   During the time in which Agent Novitzky and others were\nsearching CDT on April 8, 2004, another group of federal\nagents had executed simultaneously a separate search warrant\nat Quest’s laboratory in the District of Nevada. However,\nthese agents were unable to locate the specimens that the war-\nrant authorized them to seize, because the search warrant in\nthe District of Nevada listed the players by name, and the\nQuest specimens were identified only by number.\n\n   Quest employees informed the searching agents in the Dis-\ntrict of Nevada that the records associating the players with\ntheir identifying numbers could be found in files stored by\n   16\n      The warrant also provided for the circumstances in which “computer\npersonnel determine it is not practical to perform an on-site search or\nmake an on-site copy of the data within a reasonable amount of time,” and\nthen allowed “the computer equipment and storage devices [to] be seized\nand transported to an appropriate law enforcement laboratory for review.”\nThe agents did not make use of this procedure, however, because Agent\nAbboud determined that copying the data was possible.\n   17\n      Copies of all seized documents were provided to CDT by the govern-\nment on April 16, 2004.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                   1091\nCDT. Indeed, these records soon were discovered by agents\nat CDT and faxed to the agents at Quest.18 With this informa-\ntion, the agents in the District of Nevada applied for a third\nsearch warrant to seize the relevant items identified by num-\nber as well as by name. Judge Leavitt authorized this third\nwarrant at 6 p.m. on April 8, 2004, and agents seized from\nQuest the then-identifiable Balco players’ specimens later that\nsame night.\n\n                                     C\n\n  On April 26, 2004, the Players Association filed motions\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (hereinafter “Rule 41(g)”)19\nseeking return of the property seized.20\n  18\n    See supra pp. 1089.\n  19\n    Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) reads:\n      Motion To Return Property. A person aggrieved by an unlawful\n      search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property\n      may move for the property’s return. The motion must be filed in\n      the district where the property was seized. The court must receive\n      evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If\n      it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the\n      movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access\n      to the property and its use in later proceedings.\n   20\n      On April 30, the government applied for a fifth search warrant in the\nNorthern District of California, asking for authorization to “seize” all elec-\ntronic data “regarding drug specimens, drug testing, specimen identifica-\ntion numbers, athlete identification numbers, and drug test results, retained\nby [CDT] . . . pertaining to the drug testing of Major League Baseball\nplayers, located within the copy of a CDT computer sub-directory cur-\nrently in the possession of the [Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)] in San\nJose, California, identified as the ‘Tracey’ sub-directory, bearing the fol-\nlowing computer file group names: (1) ‘MAJOR LEAGUE GROUP’ (2)\n‘MLB BILLING’ (3) ‘MLB Drug SubCommittee’ (4) ‘MLB Follow UP’\n(5) ‘MLB IOC.’ ” Because this copy of the Tracey directory was in the\nhands of the IRS in San Jose, in the Northern District of California, the\ngovernment sought the search warrant in that district. See Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 41(g). Magistrate Judge Howard Lloyd approved the warrant. The gov-\nernment did not notify CDT, presumably because the IRS already had in\n\f1092      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   Meanwhile, the government continued to pursue its investi-\ngation. On May 5, using information culled from the Tracey\ndirectory, the government applied for new search warrants to\nseize all specimens and records relating to more than 100 non-\nBalco players who had tested positive for steroids. Magistrate\nJudge Leavitt in the District of Nevada authorized seizure of\nthe specimens from Quest, and Magistrate Judge Rosalyn M.\nChapman in the Central District of California authorized the\nseizure of records from CDT. Again, the government sought\nand obtained each warrant from the district court whose juris-\ndiction encompassed the situs of the property to be searched,\nas directed by Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b).21 The government exe-\ncuted the warrants on May 6, and the Players Association\nimmediately filed motions under Rule 41(g), seeking return of\nthe specimens and records seized.\n\nits possession the copy of the entire directory containing the relevant\nmaterials.\n   The Players Association subsequently filed a Rule 41(g) motion in the\nNorthern District of California seeking return of any property taken pursu-\nant to the April 30 search warrant, and on August 9, 2004, Judge Illston\ngranted this motion. The government did not appeal the order and does not\ndispute it now. Instead, the government asserts that it retains the right to\nreview the Tracey directory based upon the April 7 search warrants, a con-\ntention we address in this consolidated appeal.\n   Insofar as the dissent suggests that the pursuit of the April 30 search\nwarrant evidences bad faith harassment by the government and an attempt\nto evade a possibly adverse order on the motion for return of property filed\nin the Central District of California, we decline to speculate. We have no\nreason to believe that the government sought the April 30 warrant for pur-\nposes of harassment, rather than to avoid an additional search of CDT that\nwould have followed from authorization to seize the original copy in the\nCentral District. Since no district court has ever held an evidentiary hear-\ning, and the government complied with the commands of the criminal\nrules to secure search warrants from the magistrate judges in whose dis-\ntricts the property was located, based upon a showing of probable cause\nthat incriminating evidence would be found, we do not discern sufficient\nindicia of bad faith to support a contrary conclusion.\n   21\n      See supra note 11.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                  1093\n   On August 19, 2004, Judge Mahan ruled from the bench.\nHe granted the Rule 41(g) motion brought by the Players\nAssociation in the District of Nevada and ordered the govern-\nment to return all specimens seized from Quest and all notes\nand memoranda compiled by agents who reviewed the evi-\ndence, other than those pertaining to the ten Balco players\nnamed in the original search warrant.22 He made findings—\nwithout conducting an evidentiary hearing—that “[t]he gov-\nernment callously disregarded the affected players’ constitu-\ntional rights” and that the government unreasonably refused\n“to follow the procedures set forth in United States v. Tamura,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1982),” with regard to the intermingled\nrecords seized in the Central District of California. Almost six\nweeks later, and again without conducting an evidentiary\nhearing, Judge Cooper rejected the government’s suggestion\nthat the documents were seizable under the warrant exception\nthat applies to plain-view evidence of contraband,23 and\ngranted the Players Association’s Rule 41(g) motion in the\nCentral District of California. The order, which also cited the\ngovernment’s failure to follow Tamura’s procedures, man-\ndated return to CDT of any evidence seized that was not con-\nnected to the ten players named in the warrant. Judge Cooper\ndenied the government’s motion for reconsideration of this\norder on February 9, 2005.\n\n  These orders are the subjects of two of the appeals consoli-\ndated here.24\n  22\n      The government moved for a stay of this order because the evidence\nwas otherwise lawfully in its possession pursuant to the subpoena of May\n6, 2004. Judge Mahan denied the motion on November 1, 2004, based on\nthe government’s failure to raise the subpoena argument at the original\nhearing.\n   23\n      We discuss the inapplicability of this warrant exception in Section\nIII.A.4. See infra note 48.\n   24\n      The government returned to CDT and Quest all items mandated for\nreturn under the two district court orders pending resolution of the appeals.\n\f1094      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                    D\n\n   The third appeal concerns grand jury subpoenas issued to\nQuest and CDT on May 6, 2004, which were to be returned\nby June 10, 2004. These subpoenas reached all specimens and\nrecords of positive steroid drug tests for more than 100 MLB\nplayers and were not confined to records pertaining to the ten\nBalco players named in the earlier subpoenas.25 The govern-\nment also sought search warrants for this larger swath of evi-\ndence on the ground that the April 8 seizures did not provide\nall information needed for the investigation.26\n\n   Quest complied with the May 6 subpoena, providing the\ngovernment with hundreds of pages of documents, but the\ngovernment agreed to defer CDT’s compliance pending reso-\nlution of the search warrant litigation. On August 31, 2004,\nhowever, the government revoked the indefinite deferral and\ninstructed CDT to comply with the subpoena by September\n14, 2004. The Players Association filed a motion to quash the\nsubpoenas on September 13, 2004.\n  25\n    These subpoenas were not the first ones issued in the investigation.\nThe first subpoenas, dated January 16, 2004, mandated the provision of all\nMLB drug testing records. On March 3, 2004, the government obtained\nnarrower subpoenas for eleven Balco-connected players.\n   On April 22, 2004, the government sent a letter to CDT withdrawing the\nJanuary 2004 subpoenas. In the same letter, the government reduced the\nMarch 3, 2004, subpoenas to ten, not eleven, Balco players. At the time\nthe government obtained the May 6 subpoenas, the only outstanding sub-\npoenas were those of March 3, which sought the records of ten players\nwith Balco connections.\n   26\n      Recognizing that the documents they seized from CDT pursuant to the\nApril 7 search warrant might not have included all documents relevant to\nthe investigation (even with regard to Balco-related players, see infra note\n46 and accompanying text), and deciding that the positive test results\nuncovered for MLB players beyond the ten with Balco connections could\nbe valuable to the investigation, the government sought a broader warrant\non May 6 in the Central District of California.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1095\n   In December 2004, after hearing argument but without tak-\ning testimony, Judge Illston found that the government’s con-\nduct was unreasonable and constituted harassment. She filed\nan order quashing the subpoenas, which the government\ntimely appealed.\n\n                                    II\n\n   Before we review the orders granting the Rule 41(g)\nmotions in the Central District of California and the District\nof Nevada, we must decide two jurisdictional issues: whether\nthe Players Association has standing to challenge the search\nand seizure of evidence from Quest and whether the govern-\nment timely appealed Judge Cooper’s order to return the\nmaterials seized from CDT in the Central District of California.27\n\n                                    A\n\n   The government contends that the Players Association\nlacks standing to file the Rule 41(g) motion, because it lacked\naccess, control, and ownership over the records and speci-\nmens seized from Quest. Furthermore, it argues that the Play-\ners Association may not base its interest in the property (the\nurine specimens and test results) on the privacy interests of\nthe individual players.28\n  27\n      We need not decide whether the Players Association has standing to\nchallenge the CDT seizures because CDT is a party and has standing on\nits own to seek return of the property seized from its office and storage\nlocker.\n   28\n      The Supreme Court has clearly rejected “vicarious” or “target” stand-\ning to assert Fourth Amendment rights.

Either way, the government’s motion\nfails to satisfy the time requirements for tolling under Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a). To be eligible for tolling, the motion had to have\nbeen filed by October 11, 2005—ten days after the order\ngranting the Rule 41(g) motion. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).\nThe motion was filed forty-nine days after the order, exceed-\ning the time period by thirty-nine days.\n\n  The government seeks an alternative avenue to obtain toll-\ning by arguing that it did not receive notice of the order until\nNovember 2, 2004, and therefore that the time limit should\nnot be calculated from the date of the entry of judgment. We\nagree that delays in notice may offer a basis for filing after the\nnormal deadline, but the Federal Rules expressly state that\nparties must request an extension of time to file an appeal in\nsuch circumstances. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6) (permitting\na district court to reopen the time to file an appeal where a\n\f1100      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nparty did not receive notice);31 see also Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(5) (allowing a district court to extend the time to file an\nappeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause).32\n\n   The government never sought an extension of its time to\nfile a notice of appeal. Instead, in a footnote to its motion for\nreconsideration, the government made the strange request for\n“leave to file this motion for reconsideration” at a point “out-\nside of the normal time frame for the filing such motions.”\nYet the motion was timely under the local rule on motions for\nreconsideration, see C. D. Cal. Local Rule 7-18, as well as\nunder the applicable federal rule, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 60(b).\nNeither the Players Association nor the district court\nresponded to the government’s odd request; they simply\nfocused on the merits of the motion for reconsideration.\nAlthough we are not certain why the government requested\nspecial cognizance of the motion, we imagine that it may have\nfeared that the district court otherwise would dismiss the\nmotion as untimely under Rule 59(e). In any case, the govern-\nment’s request did not constitute a motion for an extension of\ntime to file an appeal, because the narrow and precise request\nasked the court to review the motion for reconsideration with-\nout any mention of a future filing, and never invoked any\nlocal or federal rule allowing time to extend the time to file\nan appeal.33\n   31\n      An extension under this rule may be granted upon a finding that the\nparty did not receive notice of the order sought to be appealed, that the\nparty filed “the motion” within 180 days after the judgment or order or\nwithin 7 days after receiving notice, whichever is earlier, and that no party\nwould be prejudiced. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A)-(C).\n   32\n      A party invoking this rule must move “no later than 30 days after the\ntime prescribed by Rule 4(a) expires” and must show “excusable neglect\nor good cause.” Fed.

App. P. 4(a)(5)(C).\n   33\n      Moreover, even if we were to calculate the time to file a motion for\nreconsideration or a notice of appeal from the date of notice—November\n2, 2004—rather than the date of entry of judgment—October 1, 2004—the\n\f          UNITED STATES v.

App. P.\n4(a)(6), which allows a court to grant a 14-day extension to\nfile an appeal, established a jurisdictional requirement. Id. at\n2366. Explaining that “Congress specifically limited the\namount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-\nof-appeal period in § 2107(c), that limitation is more than a\nsimple ‘claim-processing rule’ ” and therefore the petitioner\ncould not rely on it “to excuse his lack of compliance with the\nstatute’s time limitations.” Id.\n\n   [10] Bowles does not specifically discuss Fed. R. App. P.\n4(a)(4), the tolling provision relevant here. The government\nargues that “Rule 4(a) does not incorporate a statutory time\nlimit in its provision of tolling for Rule 59(e) or Rule 60\nmotions” and therefore that any failure to comply with the\nrule should be immunized against belated attack. However,\nalthough Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) does not contain language\nfrom 28 U.S.C. § 2107, which lacks a tolling provision, the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Bowles suggests that the same\ncharacterization applies: “Today we make clear that the\ntimely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdic-\ntional requirement.” Id.\n\n   [11] And even if Bowles did not settle the matter with\nrespect to Fed.

In order to\naccept the government’s argument, we would have to grant\nthe jurisdictional benefit of tolling while denying the tolling\nrule’s jurisdictional significance. We cannot defeat logic or\ntext in this manner. If Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) is jurisdictional,\nthe government’s motion does not qualify for tolling because\nit was filed outside the time frame specified in that rule. See\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(iv), (vi) (permitting tolling for such\nmotions only if they are filed within 10 days of entry of judg-\nment).36 If Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) is nonjurisdictional, satis-\nfaction of that provision (or forfeiture of a claim that the\ngovernment failed to satisfy it) would not enable us to ignore\nthe jurisdictional 60-day rule of Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1).37 See\n\ncommittee’s note links Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1) to 28 U.S.C. § 2107, the\nnote contains no statutory link for Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4). And although\nthe notes state that compliance with the rule “places jurisdiction in the\ncourts of appeals,” that use of the word “jurisdiction” is the kind of impre-\ncise terminology clarified in Kontrick that distinguishes between statutory\nand court-based rules. See 540 U.S. at 454 (“Courts, including this Court,\nit is true, have been less than meticulous in this regard; they have more\nthan occasionally used the term ‘jurisdictional’ to describe emphatic time\nprescriptions in rules of court. ‘Jurisdiction,’ the Court has aptly observed,\n‘is a word of many, too many, meanings.’ ” (quoting Steel Co. v.

Ct. at\n2366.\n   37\n      Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) does not provide exceptions to tolling. Instead,\nthe rule permits tolling based on a limited set of motions—including\nmotions for reconsideration filed within 10 days of entry of judgment. If\nthat provision were nonjurisdictional, the Players Association and CDT\ncould not raise its 10-day limitation as a bar to tolling under it. But neither\ncould the government invoke it as a reason to alter the 60-day time limit\nprovided by Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). No other provision of the Federal\nRule would permit tolling for a motion for reconsideration, rendering the\ngovernment’s argument ineffective.\n\f          UNITED STATES v.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1109\n       Given the highly sensitive and confidential nature of\n       drug testing samples and records and the information\n       contained therein, and given the exacting measures\n       undertaken by the parties to the [testing agreement]\n       to prevent any disclosure of the players’ test results\n       to anyone, including MLB, the MLBPA, and the\n       players themselves, any seizure of these materials,\n       absent extraordinary justification, constitutes a “cal-\n       lous disregard” for the players’ privacy interests.\n\nWere we to accept this reasoning, any seizure of confidential\nrecords would reveal callous disregard for privacy rights,\neven if such seizure were expressly authorized by a lawful\nsearch warrant.\n\n   The government’s conduct in the District of Nevada does\nnot support a finding of callous disregard. After showing\nprobable cause, the government obtained approval from Mag-\nistrate Judge Leavitt to search and to seize the urine samples\nand drug testing records held at Quest. Although the Players\nAssociation contends that the government had no legal right\nto use the intermingled files taken from CDT to support its\nMay search warrant affidavits, there is an insufficient show-\ning of callous disregard in the government’s use of that evi-\ndence to obtain a warrant, in light of its view that the\ninformation was authorized for seizure under Magistrate\nJudge Johnson’s search warrant protocol.41\n\n   Furthermore, contrary to the assertion of the Players Asso-\nciation, the government agents did not offer “misleading rep-\nresentations” to obtain the search warrant, and the\n  41\n    Because Ramsden requires an assessment of jurisdiction over a Rule\n41(g) motion prior to determining the merits of the motion, we reserve our\ndiscussion of the objective legality of the use of the intermingled evidence\nseized from CDT for our review of the merits of the order granting the\nmotion. See infra Section IV.B. As that discussion reveals, our conclusion\nwith regard to the law accords with our view of jurisdiction.\n\f1110     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ngovernment did not hide the controversy surrounding the sub-\npoena that had been issued for the same property. The affida-\nvit for the search warrant in the District of Nevada advised\nMagistrate Judge Leavitt that CDT and Quest “intend[ed] to\nmove to quash the subpoena.” Later, that language was\ncrossed out and replaced with a handwritten note: “A motion\nto quash has been filed. 4.7.04,” followed by Magistrate\nJudge Leavitt’s initials. The record makes clear that Magis-\ntrate Judge Leavitt was duly advised of the subpoenas and\ntheir status in court. The government’s affidavits do not reveal\ncallous disregard for the players’ privacy interests in the urine\nsamples and other testing evidence held in the District of\nNevada. No doubt these samples and test results implicated\nsensitive privacy interests, but the government was not there-\nfore compelled to stymie its enforcement of the law by declin-\ning to pursue search warrants at all, especially since warrants\nare designed to protect Fourth Amendment privacy interests.\n\n   Not only did the government establish probable cause, but\nthe agents executed the search warrant with due respect for\nthe interests of the MLB players and Quest, the third party\nsearched. The government seized items clearly delineated by\nthe warrant and accepted the assistance of Quest personnel to\navoid taking unrelated items, thus displaying attentiveness\nboth to the warrant’s scope and avoiding unnecessary interfer-\nence with Quest’s business operations. Quest cooperated in\nthe search and declined to join the Players Association’s sub-\nsequent Rule 41(g) motion. We conclude that the first prong\nof the Ramsden analysis weighs against invocation of the dis-\ntrict court’s equitable jurisdiction over the Rule 41(g)\nmotions.\n\n                               2\n\n   As to the second of the four Ramsden factors (the movants’\nindividual interests in the evidence seized), the Players Asso-\nciation argues that its interests in the property mirror those of\nits members. We agree that its members possess strong pri-\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1111\nvacy interests in both their drug test results and the actual\nspecimens. See Roe v.

As the Players Association notes, the public release\nof positive drug testing evidence could irreparably damage the\ncareers of the affected players, even if the positive results\nwere not actually caused by illegal steroid use. Based on this\ndanger, we agree that the third factor also weighs in favor of\nequitable jurisdiction.\n\n                               4\n\n   [14] Although we conclude that the district court erred in\nfinding callous disregard of Fourth Amendment rights, the\nthree other equitable jurisdiction factors weigh in favor of\nhearing the motions by the Players Association. See Ramsden,\n2 F.3d at 326 (holding that where three of the four factors\nfavored an exercise of equitable jurisdiction, the court had\npower to hear a Rule 41(g) motion). As such, we cannot say\nthat Judge Mahan’s initial choice to hear the motion consti-\ntuted an abuse of discretion.\n\n                               B\n\n   We turn now to the merits of Judge Mahan’s substantive\nruling requiring the return of property seized in the District of\nNevada that did not relate solely to the ten players named in\nthe April 7 search warrants.\n\f1112     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                  1\n\n   [15] With respect to property taken during the execution of\nsearch warrants, Rule 41(g) provides that a person “aggrieved\nby an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the depri-\nvation of property may move for the property’s return.” When\nsuch a motion is granted, the property in question must be\nreturned to the moving party, but a court “may impose reason-\nable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in\nlater proceedings.” Id. Although the rule itself does not set a\nstandard for determining when property should be returned to\na moving party, an advisory committee’s note explains that\n“reasonableness under all of the circumstances must be the\ntest.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g), advisory committee’s note.42\n\n   The Players Association argues that the seizure of property\nfrom Quest in the District of Nevada was unreasonable. The\nPlayers Association offers no argument that the search of\nQuest exceeded the terms of the search warrant or was exe-\ncuted in an unconstitutional manner. Instead, the Players\nAssociation argues that the search warrant lacked a legal\nfoundation because the government’s affidavits used inter-\nmingled files seized at CDT to name individuals other than\nthe ten players previously identified. The Players Association\ncontends that these files were illegally seized and that “the\ngovernment . . . [is forbidden] from disseminating or using the\nfruits of an illegal search.” Under the doctrine of the “fruit of\nthe poisonous tree,” evidence may not be used if “ ‘granting\nestablishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which\ninstant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of\nthat illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable\nto be purged of the primary taint.’ ” Wong Sun v.

We concluded that no Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred when agents seized “single\nfiles and single ledgers, i.e., single items which, though theo-\nretically separable, in fact constitute one volume or file fold-\ner.” Id. at 877. We constrained our ruling by stating that “the\nreasons we have given for allowing [such] seizure may not\napply to sets of ledgers or files, but because that is not the\ncase here, we find it unnecessary to discuss it further.” Id.\n(emphasis added).\n\n   [17] Three years later, in Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we consid-\nered whether the government could seize a set of hard-copy\nfiles including target data as well as information not specified\nin the search warrant. In that case, officers executed a search\nwarrant for three specified categories of records stored at a\nLos Angeles office. Id. at 594. Agents seized—without any\nlimiting effort—files that were not specified in the search\nwarrant. Id. at 595. We condemned such “wholesale seizure\nfor later detailed examination of records not described in a\nwarrant.” Id. (emphasis omitted). Holding that the Fourth\nAmendment barred the conversion of a specific warrant into\na general one, we described two methods by which the gov-\nernment could avoid such constitutional violations.\n\n   First, if the government anticipated that on-site segregation\nof target documents would not be feasible in a reasonable\namount of time, it can seek a preordained warrant protocol\nallowing the seizure of such intermingled documents. This\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            1115\napproach would ensure proper judicial oversight of any sei-\nzures.\n\n       If the need for transporting the documents is known\n       to the officers prior to the search, they may apply for\n       specific authorization for large-scale removal of\n       material, which should be granted by the magistrate\n       issuing the warrant only where on-site sorting is\n       infeasible and no other practical alternative exists.\n       See United States v. Hillyard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403710\"><a href=\"/opinion/403710/united-states-v-james-arthur-hillyard/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1340\n       (9th Cir. 1982). The essential safeguard required is\n       that wholesale removal must be monitored by the\n       judgment of a neutral, detached magistrate.\n\nTamura, 694 F.2d at 596. Specific authorization to make such\nseizures depends on detailed information in the government’s\nsearch warrant affidavits, which should describe “the relevant\ntechnological issues,” Managing Discovery, supra note 13, at\n21, and the feasibility of parsing the anticipated storage\nmedia. With such information, a magistrate can set forth\nguidelines that ensure the government does not seize inter-\nmingled data without judicial oversight. If a warrant includes\nsuch protocol, and the government abides by it, post-search\nreview is not necessary.44\n\n   Second, if the government obtained a search warrant with-\nout a preordained protocol for removing intermingled target\nand non-target data, but encountered an unanticipated need to\nseize units containing intermingled data, agents could seize\nthat unit and seal it pending post-search review. Only if\nauthorized by the “judgment of a neutral, detached magis-\ntrate” could it keep the seized items. Like the use of a pre-\nsearch protocol, this second method of post-search authoriza-\ntion would ensure judicial oversight in cases where on-site\nsegregation of intermingled data cannot feasibly occur.\n  44\n   In other words, a Fourth Amendment violation could still occur if the\ngovernment did not comply with the warrant protocol, or if the warrant\nwas issued without probable cause.\n\f1116      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   [18] In the comparatively rare instances where documents\nare so intermingled that they cannot feasibly be sorted on site,\nwe suggest that the Government and law enforcement offi-\ncials generally can avoid violating fourth amendment rights\nby sealing and holding the documents pending approval by a\nmagistrate of a further search, in accordance with the proce-\ndures set forth in the American Law Institute’s Model Code\nof Pre-Arraignment Procedure.45\n  45\n      The Tamura court pointed to the American Law Institute’s Model\nCode of Pre-Arraignment Procedure as a guide that would help agents\navoid constitutional violations in situations where intermingled documents\nneeded to be seized but where the search warrant lacked a protocol for\nsuch seizures. 694 F.2d at 595-96. The Tamura court found that the agents\nhad violated Fourth Amendment rights by making a “wholesale seizure,”\nrendering the post-search alternative approach to be advisory dicta.

We recognize that some courts in other cir-\ncuits have questioned the procedures advised in Tamura. One district court\nin Michigan explained: “The Court declines to follow Tamura, at least in\nthis case, because Tamura did not involve computer files and therefore did\nnot consider the specific problems associated with conducting a search for\ncomputerized records.” United States v.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1117\nTamura, 694 F.2d at 595-96 (footnote omitted).\n\n   Recently, we applied Tamura to uphold seizures of inter-\nmingled documents in the computer context. In United States\nv. Adjani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794809\"><a href=\"/opinion/794809/united-states-v-christopher-lee-adjani-jana-reinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2006), investigating agents\nobtained a search warrant to seize evidence of the defendant\nAdjani’s extortion activities. Id. at 1142. The search warrant\ncontained a detailed protocol for the seizure of intermingled\nevidence. Id. at 1149 (“The Adjani warrant ‘describe[d] in\ngreat[ ] detail the items one commonly expects to find on\npremises used for the criminal activities in question . . . .’ ”\n(alterations in original)). In executing the warrant, agents\nseized Adjani’s computer as well as the computer of a woman\nliving with him, who was not identified as a suspect in the\nwarrant. Id. The computers were subsequently searched at an\nFBI computer lab, and evidence they contained was used to\ncharge both Adjani and his housemate. In a motion to sup-\npress the evidence, the two defendants argued that the\nwoman’s computer was not seizable under the search warrant,\nand if it were, that the search warrant was overbroad. We\nrejected both claims, citing the difficulty of segregating elec-\ntronic data:\n\n    We understand the heightened specificity concerns\n    in the computer context, given the vast amount of\n    data they can store. As the defendants urge, the war-\n    rant arguably might have provided for a “less inva-\n    sive search . . . .” Avoiding that kind of specificity\n    and limitation was not unreasonable under the cir-\n    cumstances here, however. To require such a pin-\n    pointed computer search, restricting the search to an\n    email program or to specific search terms, would\n    likely have failed to cast a sufficiently wide net to\n    capture the evidence sought. Cf. [United States v.]\n    Ross, 456 U.S. [798,] 821 [1982] (“When a legiti-\n    mate search is under way, and when its purpose and\n    its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinc-\n    tions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the\n\f1118     UNITED STATES v.

Id. at 1152. “Computers are simul-\ntaneously file cabinets (with millions of files) and locked desk\ndrawers; they can be repositories of innocent and deeply per-\nsonal information, but also of evidence of crimes. . . . As soci-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            1119\nety grows ever more reliant on computers . . . courts will be\ncalled upon to analyze novel legal issues and develop new\nrules within our well established Fourth Amendment jurispru-\ndence.” Id. Attuned to the needs of law enforcement as well\nas privacy, we upheld the validity of the search warrant and\nrejected the argument that items of evidence fell “outside the\nscope of the warrant because they implicated [a person not\nnamed in the warrant] in the crime and supported a charge of\nconspiracy to commit extortion [against her].” Id. at 1151.\n\n   In 2006, we confirmed the validity of this analysis in\nUnited States v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795398\"><a href=\"/opinion/795398/united-states-v-justin-barrett-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.), where we\naddressed a motion to suppress evidence. The defendant\nargued that the warrant was overbroad because it allowed the\nseizure of computer and storage media related to child por-\nnography without requiring the government to conduct an on-\nsite search and without providing a protocol. Id. at 973-78.\nCiting Tamura and Adjani, we explained that on-site review\nwas not always required. Id. at 975-76. We emphasized the\n“serious risk that the police might damage the storage\nmedium or compromise the integrity of the evidence by\nattempting to access the data at the scene” and the disruption\ncaused by attempts to segregate complex electronic data on-\nsite:\n\n    [T]he process of searching the files at the scene can\n    take a long time. To be certain that the medium in\n    question does not contain any seizable material, the\n    officers would have to examine every one of what\n    may be thousands of files on a disk—a process that\n    could take many hours and perhaps days. Taking that\n    much time to conduct the search would not only\n    impose a significant and unjustified burden on police\n    resources, it would also make the search more intru-\n    sive. . . . If the search took hours or days, the intru-\n    sion would continue for that entire period,\n    compromising the Fourth Amendment value of mak-\n\f1120     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    ing police searches as brief and non-intrusive as pos-\n    sible.\n\nId. at 974-75. In light of these concerns, we concluded that it\nwas “reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for the police\nto take all of [the defendant’s] computer storage media from\nhis home (they did not find his computer) so they could con-\nduct their search offsite in a police laboratory, rather than car-\nrying out the search onsite and taking only whatever evidence\nof [targeted material] they might find.” Id. at 968. “[T]he war-\nrant was not fatally defective in failing to require an onsite\nsearch and isolation of child pornography before removing\nstorage media wholesale.” Id. at 975.\n\n   [19] We then addressed whether the warrant was invalid\nbecause it lacked a specific protocol for seizures of electronic\ndata. Although we made clear that a specific protocol was not\nmandatory, we stated that a “warrant[ ] authorizing blanket\nremoval of all computer storage media for later examination,”\nmust be premised upon an “affidavit giving a reasonable\nexplanation . . . why a wholesale seizure is necessary.” Id. at\n976 (citing Tamura, 694 F.2d at 595). “A warrant describing\na category of items is not invalid if a more specific descrip-\ntion is impossible,” id. at 973, as long as the affidavit explains\nwhy “the officers could not reasonably describe the objects of\ntheir search with more specificity,” id. at 976.\n\n   The agents in Hill offered neither a detailed description of\nthe items to be seized nor any explanation of why a specific\ndescription was impossible. “Accordingly, we h[e]ld that the\nwarrant here was overbroad in authorizing a blanket seizure\nin the absence of an explanatory supporting affidavit, which\nwould have documented the informed endorsement of the\nneutral magistrate.” Id. at 976-77 (citing Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">596</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">). At the same time, we held that “the search here was sup-\nported by probable cause and, notwithstanding the shortcom-\nings of the search warrant affidavit, the manner of its\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1121\nexecution d[id] not mandate suppression of the fruits of that\nsearch.” Id. at 979 (emphasis added).\n\n                              3\n\n   [20] We now apply these precedents to determine whether\nthe seizures at CDT were unlawful. The problems of intru-\nsiveness that we recognized in Hill are all the more apparent\nhere because the search was conducted on the premises of a\nthird party business. In this case, the government obtained\nadvance authorization to seize intermingled documents based\nupon a search warrant protocol that had been carefully out-\nlined and supported. The government’s affidavits were prem-\nised on the advice of computer specialists, who anticipated\nthat certain intermingled evidence might be difficult to sepa-\nrate on-site:\n\n    Upon searching the premises, law enforcement per-\n    sonnel trained in searching and seizing computer\n    data (the “computer personnel”) will make an initial\n    review of any computer equipment and storage\n    devices to determine whether these items can be\n    searched on-site in a reasonable amount of time and\n    without jeopardizing the ability to preserve the data.\n    ...\n\n    If the computer personnel determine that it is not\n    practical to perform an on-site search or make an on-\n    site copy of the data within a reasonable amount of\n    time, then the computer equipment and storage\n    devices will be seized and transported to an appro-\n    priate law enforcement laboratory for review.\n\nAs we explained in Hill, the affidavits did not require pre-\nscience but they must contain a candid recitation of the avail-\nable information.\n\n    Without such individualized justification being pres-\n    ented to the magistrate, we cannot be sure that the\n\f1122     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    judge was aware of the officers’ intent and the tech-\n    nological limitations meriting the indiscriminate\n    seizure—and thus was intelligently able to exercise\n    the court’s oversight function. An explanatory state-\n    ment in the affidavit also assures us that the officers\n    could not reasonably describe the objects of their\n    search with more specificity.\n\n459 F.3d at 976. In this case, unlike in Hill, the government\nsubmitted detailed affidavits describing the anticipated diffi-\nculties of sorting computer data on-site. The affidavits pro-\nposed a protocol to guide and to limit the seizures of\nintermingled evidence, which Magistrate Judge Johnson\napproved.\n\n   Furthermore, the record reveals that the government com-\nplied with the protocol in the warrant. Agent Abboud, a com-\nputer analyst, determined that on-site review would not be\nfeasible in a reasonable amount of time. The agents then cop-\nied several intermingled documents, including the Tracey\ndirectory. They did not seize the actual computer, although\nthe search warrant authorized full seizure of the hardware if\ncomputer analysts determined that neither on-site searching\nnor copying were feasible. The government thereby enabled\nCDT to continue its business operations.\n\n   Although the Players Association contends that the govern-\nment behaved unreasonably by copying the entire Tracey\ndirectory, an analysis of the difficulty of segregating intermin-\ngled electronic data reveals the opposite. The Federal Judicial\nCenter recently explained:\n\n    [S]ome computer-based transactions do not result in\n    a conventional document, but instead are represented\n    in integrated databases. Even less-complex ESI\n    [electronically stored information] may be incompre-\n    hensible and unusable when separated from the sys-\n    tem that created it. For example, a spreadsheet\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                    1123\n       produced in portable document format (PDF) may be\n       useless because embedded information, such as com-\n       putational formulas, cannot be seen or discerned.\n       Finally, deleting an electronic document does not get\n       rid of it, as shredding a paper document would. An\n       electronic document may be recovered from the hard\n       drive, to the extent it has not been overwritten . . . .\n\n          These differences between ESI and conventional\n       information have implications for discovery. For\n       example, the dynamic nature of ESI makes it vital\n       that a data producer institute “litigation holds” to\n       preserve information that may be discoverable, often\n       even before the lawsuit is filed. Moreover, the vol-\n       ume and multiple sources of ESI may lead to dis-\n       putes about the scope of discovery and may make\n       review to identify and segregate privileged informa-\n       tion more difficult . . . .\n\nManaging Discovery, supra note 13, at 3-4.46 At the risk of\nlosing data, the government ensured that CDT could continue\nits business activities, thus evidencing the reasonableness and\nrestraint conspicuously absent in the “wholesale seizure” con-\nducted by the agents in Tamura.47\n  46\n      Agent Novitsky expressed the government’s awareness of these risks\nin his May search warrant affidavits: “IRS Special Agent Jeff Jack, a\nComputer Investigative Specialist with the IRS, . . . gave me specific\nexamples of deleted files or temporary files created when printing a file\nthat cannot be[ ] seen or retrieved from a simple copy of a computer sub-\ndirectory, but may be retrievable using forensic tools, if allowed to exam-\nine the entire computer system.”\n   47\n      Increasingly, courts have recognized the danger of losing electronic\ninformation or obtaining only incomplete data. See Adjani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794809\"><a href=\"/opinion/794809/united-states-v-christopher-lee-adjani-jana-reinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\nHill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795398\"><a href=\"/opinion/795398/united-states-v-justin-barrett-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also Scott-Emuakpor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">288443</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8\n(“[T]he agents were not confined to searching the files on the hard drive\nand disks but could also lawfully search for deleted material . . .

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   Although the seizure of intermingled evidence was permit-\nted under the warrant protocol, the Players Association argues\nthat the government violated the search warrant’s protocol by\nallowing Agent Novitzky to open and to view the contents of\nthe Tracey directory, rather than leaving Agent Abboud to\nsearch alone. Under this view, only Agent Abboud was per-\nmitted to open and to view CDT computer data on-site. How-\never, the plain language of the search warrant did not exclude\nthe assistance of other law enforcement officers—especially\nfor tasks involving non-digital work (such as seeking coopera-\ntion from persons on site). The warrant only required that\ncomputer personnel be the ones to determine whether on-site\nsegregation of target data is feasible. The sort of assistance\nprovided by Agent Novitzky, a non-specialized law enforce-\nment officer under the guidance of Agent Abboud, was per-\nmissible under the search warrant and reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment.\n\n   The dissent criticizes the government’s decision to “copy\nthe entire directory,” pursuant to Agent Abboud’s recommen-\ndation, rather than to “copy[ ] only the subdirectories that per-\ntained to Major League Baseball” and suggests that the\ngovernment should have trusted CDT to point out the relevant\nfiles. Dissent at 1143. The dissent explains that this approach\nwould have allowed the government to select the relevant\nfiles on-site: “Dr. Jean Joseph of CDT later stated in an affi-\ndavit that the directory was easily searched by key word and\nwould have provided the test information about the ten play-\ners in a short period of time.” Id.\n\n   [21] We disagree. “The government should not be required\nto trust the suspect’s self-labeling when executing a warrant.”\nAdjani, 452 F.3d at 1150. Agents had no duty to rely on CDT\npersonnel to point out the files seizable under the warrant.\nLike most searched parties, CDT had an incentive to avoid\ngiving over documents of which the government might be\nunaware and to read the search warrant as narrowly as possi-\nble. Moreover, the government had no reason to confine its\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                1125\nsearch to “key words” such as the names of the baseball play-\ners. “Computer files are easy to disguise or rename, and were\nwe to limit the warrant to such a specific search protocol,\nmuch evidence could escape discovery simply because of [the\ndefendants’] labeling of the files.” Id. Such a limited search\ncould easily have overlooked documents crucial to the investi-\ngation, such as the specimens at Quest, which were identified\nonly by number. See supra pp. 1086-90.\n\n   [22] We do not discern a violation of the Fourth Amend-\nment’s requirements simply because the agents determined,\nupon the review and recommendation of a computer special-\nist, that certain intermingled files could not be feasibly sorted\non-site.48 As we explained in Tamura, and reiterated in Adjani\nand Hill, the seizure of electronic evidence can entail complex\nsifting efforts. By obtaining from a neutral magistrate permis-\nsion to seize intermingled documents under a specific proto-\ncol, the government respected privacy interests while\npursuing the law enforcement. The agents’ ultimate decision\nto remove relevant data for off-site review stemmed not from\ndisregard of privacy rights, but from sensitivity to the ongoing\ndisruption caused by the search to CDT—an innocent third\nparty in the underlying investigation.\n\n                                    4\n\n   [23] Our determination that the search and seizures at CDT\nwere valid provides a necessary component of our legal anal-\nysis of Judge Mahan’s order granting the Rule 41(g) motion\nin the District of Nevada. Judge Mahan premised his order on\nthe legal conclusion that the government unlawfully seized\n  48\n    We do not reach the government’s argument that the “plain view”\nexception to the warrant requirement justified seizure of the intermingled\nevidence, because the evidence fell within the scope of the search warrant.\nSee Beusch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365597\"><a href=\"/opinion/365597/united-states-v-willi-beusch-and-deak-company-of-california-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“Because we hold that the items seized were\ncovered by the terms of the warrant, we find it unnecessary to deal with\nthe Government’s contentions that they were admissible under the ‘plain\nview’ exception to the warrant requirement.”).\n\f1126    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nintermingled data from CDT and could not use that data to\nsupport an expanded search warrant in the District of Nevada.\nOur de novo legal analysis shows that Judge Mahan misinter-\npreted Tamura. A lawful search does not produce poisonous\nfruit. Because the CDT search was lawful, the information\nseized in that search provided a legitimate basis for expanded\nwarrants in the District of Nevada. As we explained in Adjani:\n“There is no rule . . . that evidence turned up while officers\nare rightfully searching a location under a properly issued\nwarrant must be excluded simply because the evidence found\nmay support charges for a related crime (or against a suspect)\nnot expressly contemplated in the warrant.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; cf.\nBeusch, 596 F.2d at 877 (“[A]s long as an item appears, at the\ntime of the search, to contain evidence reasonably related to\nthe purposes of the search, there is no reason—absent some\nother Fourth Amendment violation—to suppress it.” (empha-\nsis added)); Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597 (noting that although the\nagents unambiguously had flouted the limits of the search\nwarrant “we cannot say, although we find it a close case, that\nthe officers so abused the warrant’s authority that the other-\nwise valid warrant was transformed into a general one,\nthereby requiring all fruits to be suppressed”).\n\n   Furthermore, an order to return property under Rule 41(g)\nis inappropriate where “the government’s need for the prop-\nerty as evidence continues.” United States v.

R. Crim. P. 41(g), advisory com-\nmittee’s note. It is when the government no longer needs the\nproperty as evidence in an investigation that a presumption in\nfavor of return arises. Fitzen, 80 F.3d at 388.\n\n  [24] A return of property should follow only a particularly\negregious violation: “The issue is whether the Government’s\nconduct was sufficiently reprehensible in this case to warrant\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1127\nthis sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327. In Ramsden, we\nrefused to impose this extreme sanction on police who had\ntime to obtain a warrant but made no effort to do so and “sim-\nply chose not to comply with [their] obligations under the\nFourth Amendment.” Id. at 325, 327. The government’s\nbehavior in this case was reasonable and fell far short of the\negregious and unchecked intrusions that might justify a return\nof property under Rule 41(g).49\n\n   [25] The government’s seizures were neither unreasonable\nnor exceeded the four corners of the warrants. Our technologi-\ncally advancing world combines in novel forms the kind of\ndata that in a previous age might have been segregated. Par-\nties are not immunized from law enforcement simply because\nthey choose to store data in complex or integrated formats.\nWe conclude that the district court abused its discretion by\ngranting the Rule 41(g) motion based upon its contrary, and\nerroneous, view of the law.50\n   49\n      We do not belabor the government’s alleged failure to follow its own\ninternal guidelines. The dissent takes note that the U.S. Attorney’s manual\nstates “that a search warrant should normally not be used to obtain confi-\ndential materials such as treatment records,” and that the Department of\nJustice’s guidelines disfavor use of a search warrant where a subpoena\nwould suffice. See Dissent at 1165. The existence of those guidelines is\nnot disputed. Yet, quite simply, the government’s guidelines do not dictate\nwhat is “reasonable” under the Fourth Amendment. If its guidelines did\nso, the government would have every reason to enact permissive internal\nrules. We have no reason or authority to give the government that perverse\nincentive.\n   50\n      We do not hold that the government enjoys a right to “wholesale” sei-\nzure of evidence without judicial authorization; indeed, our decision\nstands for the opposite. See supra Section IV; see also Tamura, 694 F.2d\nat 594-96.\n   We do not doubt that a different case might present facts under which\nthe seizure of intermingled documents would constitute an “unreasonable\nsearch[ ] and seizure[ ].” U.S. Const. amend. IV. But that case is not pres-\nented here. The government obtained proper authorization in the form of\na search warrant protocol addressed specifically to the seizure of intermin-\ngled computer documents. The search warrant was obtained “upon proba-\n\f1128      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                                    V\n\n   We next consider the government’s appeal of Judge Ills-\nton’s order quashing the May 6 subpoenas, which sought from\nCDT and Quest the drug testing records and specimens for all\nMLB players who tested positive for steroids.51 Under Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 17(c)(2), a “court may quash . . . [a] subpoena if\ncompliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.” The dis-\ntrict court found that the May 2004 subpoenas constituted\nharassment and were unreasonable.52\n\n   To support its finding, the district court pointed to United\nStates v. American Honda Motor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248483\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248483/united-states-v-american-honda-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D.\nIll. 1967). In American Honda, the government issued sub-\npoenas that were “substantially identical” to one another but\nin different locations. Id. at 819. As a result, Honda was faced\nwith producing the same documents repeatedly, and the court\nfound this to be harassment. Id. at 819-20. American Honda,\nhowever, does not preclude the government from pursuing the\nsame information through the contemporaneous issuance of\nsubpoenas and applications for search warrants.\n\n  We addressed the issuance of contemporaneous search war-\nrants and subpoenas in In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated\nDecember 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854. There we upheld the\nvalidity of the subpoenas against the challenge that “the sub-\npoenas were served at the same time as the search warrants\n\nble cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing\nthe place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. Because our holding reaffirms that searches of elec-\ntronic databases must conform to the requirements of the Fourth Amend-\nment following the reasoning of Tamura, the dissent’s fear that all medical\ndatabases and voluntary drug testing programs will be put at risk is utterly\nunfounded. See Dissent at 1137-38, 1184-88.\n   51\n      We review a district court’s decision to quash a grand jury subpoena\nfor abuse of discretion. In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 803 F.2d at 496.\n   52\n      The district court did not find that the subpoenas were oppressive.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1129\nand the federal agents attempted to ‘enforce’ the subpoenas\nthrough immediate seizure of the documents.” Id. at 854. Not-\ning that the challenge to the subpoenas received no support in\nprecedent, we clarified the differences between subpoenas and\nsearch warrants:\n\n    Subpoenas are not search warrants. They involve dif-\n    ferent levels of intrusion on a person’s privacy. A\n    search warrant allows the officer to enter the per-\n    son’s premises, and to examine for himself the per-\n    son’s belongings. The officer, pursuant to the\n    warrant, determines what is seized.\n\nId. By comparison:\n\n    Service of a forthwith subpoena does not authorize\n    an entry into a private residence. Furthermore, the\n    person served determines whether he will surrender\n    the items identified in the subpoena or challenge the\n    validity of the subpoena prior to compliance.\n\nId. We concluded that “[t]hese differences are not eliminated\nby the fact that the search warrants and subpoenas were deliv-\nered at the same time” and observed that the complaining\nparty had “failed to show that the papers that are described in\nthe subpoenas are outside the scope of a legitimate investiga-\ntion by the grand jury.” Id. at 854-55. In addition, we specifi-\ncally emphasized the fact that the defendant was given almost\na month to comply with the subpoenas. Id. at 854.\n\n   [26] Therefore, the district court erred in finding the issu-\nance of subpoenas and the contemporaneous execution of\nsearch warrants to be unreasonable. The Players Association\nhas not argued that the evidence sought by the subpoenas is\n“outside the scope of a legitimate investigation by the grand\njury.” Id. at 855. The subpoenas were not returnable on the\nsame day that the search warrants were executed. As in In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas, the return dates on the subpoenas\n\f1130      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nwere over a month from the date on which the warrants were\nexecuted. The district court declared the May 6 subpoenas an\n“unreasonable insurance” policy, but it failed to recognize the\ndifferent purposes and requirements of the warrant as com-\npared to the subpoena and the legitimate concern that produc-\ntion of relevant evidence to the grand jury would be unduly\ndelayed. See id. at 854. It was error to conflate the two dis-\ntinct tools. Insurance it may have been; but, under the Fourth\nAmendment, unreasonable it was not.\n\n   The district court also deemed the government’s actions\nunreasonable because it found that the agents sought search\nwarrants in three separate districts in an attempt to avoid a\nruling on the motion to quash the existing subpoenas of Janu-\nary and March 2004. We note that granting the motion to\nquash would not have prevented the government from seeking\nthe search warrants, particularly given the existence of proba-\nble cause. Unlike a subpoena, a search warrant may be\nobtained only upon a showing of probable cause—a burden\nthe government sometimes considers necessary to establish in\norder to obtain certain production of evidence.53 In contrast,\na grand jury subpoena may issue simply because an Assistant\nUnited States Attorney believes the evidence may assist the\ngrand jury in furthering the progress of an ongoing investiga-\ntion which may never establish probable cause to charge any-\none. If a subpoena based on the lesser standard of evidence\ndoes not withstand review, it does not follow that a search\nwarrant premised on a far higher evidentiary showing could\nnot be authorized. As the Fourth Circuit has noted, “the fact\nthat a grand jury subpoena existed . . . at the time of the\nsearch obviously had no effect upon whether probable cause\n  53\n     Significantly, while a subpoena may be quashed, a “person to be\nsearched has no lawful way to prevent execution of the warrant.” In re\nGrand Jury Subpoenas Dated December 10, 1987, 926 F.2d at 854.

In the appeals at bar,\nthe records contain extremely sensitive information, espe-\ncially the drug testing records. If revealed, this information\ncould adversely affect the reputations of many competitive\nbaseball players. Therefore, the motion to unseal requires a\ncareful balancing of the interests at stake. See id. (noting that\naccess to judicial records may be limited to protect the pri-\nvacy interests of the litigants, such as to avoid disclosure of\n“sources of business information that might harm a litigant’s\ncompetitive standing”).\n\n   [27] Although we have jurisdiction to conduct a merits\nanalysis of the motion to unseal, the district courts—having\ngreater familiarity with the records56—are in a better position\nto balance the privacy interests and to determine which mate-\nrials are protected grand jury materials. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n   55\n      Gerstein premises his motion on 9th Cir. R. 27-13(c). That rule states:\n“During the pendency of an appeal, any party may file a motion with this\ncourt requesting that matters filed under seal either in the district court or\nin this court be unsealed.

Although Joshua Gerstein is not a “party” under this\nrule, his standing derives from his constitutional interest and does not\ndepend upon the applicability of 9th Cir.

Therefore, we refer the Gerstein motion to the district\ncourts for consideration.\n\n                             VII\n\n  To summarize the resolution of these consolidated appeals:\n\n   1) We have no jurisdiction to address the legal foundation\nfor the grant of the Rule 41(g) motion in the Central District\nof California, although we recognize that our authoritative\ninterpretation of Tamura conflicts with the vision of Tamura\nupon which that order was based. The government cannot\nobtain redress for any alleged errors or impropriety in that\norder, where it failed to object in a timely manner. The gov-\nernment’s appeal of the grant of the Rule 41(g) motion is\nDISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction; the order of the Central\nDistrict of California denying the government’s motion for\nreconsideration is AFFIRMED.\n\n   2) The government’s seizures at the Quest facility in Las\nVegas were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The\norder of the District of Nevada granting the Rule 41(g) motion\nis REVERSED.\n\n   3) The record, illuminated by caselaw, reveals that the sub-\npoenas to CDT and Quest, which covered the same evidence\nas the contemporaneous search warrants, were not unreason-\nable and did not constitute harassment. The order of the\nNorthern District of California quashing the May 6 subpoenas\nis REVERSED.\n\fUNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING   1135\n                                    Volume 2 of 2\n\f1136    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n\n\n\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   One of the three extremely able district court judges who\nrejected the government’s argument summarized it best, stat-\ning: “What happened to the Fourth Amendment? Was it\nrepealed somehow?”\n\n   Although it only had a search warrant for data concerning\neleven Major League Baseball players, the government seized\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING       1137\nthousands of medical records and test results involving every\nsingle Major League Baseball player. The government did not\nstop there, seizing thousands of other medical records for\nindividuals in thirteen other major sports organizations, three\nunaffiliated business entities, and three sports competitions.\nThe government now seeks to retain all of the medical infor-\nmation it obtained about persons who were not the subject of\nany criminal inquiry.\n\n   The stakes in this case are high. The government claims the\nright to seize and retain—without warrant or even a suspicion\nof criminal activity—any patient’s confidential medical\nrecord or other confidential personal information contained in\na computer directory so long as it has a legitimate warrant or\nsubpoena for any other individual patient’s record that may be\nstored on the same computer. The government attempted to\njustify this novel theory on a breathtaking expansion of the\n“plain view” doctrine, which clearly has no application to\nintermingled private electronic data.\n\n   The majority ignores the government’s plain view\nargument—a theory rejected by every district judge involved\nin this case. Instead, the majority invents a new justification\nfor approving the seizures. It holds that the boilerplate terms\nof a computer search warrant justify both the seizure of mas-\nsive amounts of confidential medical information about per-\nsons not suspected of any criminal activity and the subsequent\nwarrantless search of the information. Under the majority’s\nrationale, the government may now seize anyone’s private\nmedical records and other confidential personal information,\nand remove the records for a later warrantless search, so long\nas those records are intermingled with records that are respon-\nsive to a warrant and the government can justify that on-site\nsorting of those records would be impractical.\n\n  The consequences of this decision are profound. Today’s\ndecision will allow the government unprecedented easy\naccess to confidential medical and other private information\n\f1138    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nabout citizens who are under no suspicion of having been\ninvolved in criminal activity. At a time when our medical\ninstitutions are working diligently to provide physicians with\neasy nationwide electronic access to patient records in order\nto improve the care and treatment of our citizens, the opinion\nposes a very serious threat to the confidentiality of patient\nrecords and ultimately to the effective delivery of health care\nitself.\n\n   The majority’s holding will also significantly and adversely\nimpact the viability of voluntary workplace drug testing. As\nthe National Chamber of Commerce has pointed out in its\namicus brief, today’s decision will make it very unlikely that\nemployees or unions will agree to any voluntary employer\ndrug testing in the future, as any promise of confidentiality\nhas now been rendered completely illusory. It will make\nefforts to curb substance abuse in the workplace harder, not\neasier.\n\n   The majority’s holding also conflicts with the procedures\ndetailed by our Circuit in United States v. Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1982) for the appropriate and constitutional pro-\ncessing of seized information not responsive to a warrant that\nis intermingled with data that is responsive to a warrant.\n\n   The majority also improperly rejects the factual findings of\nthe district judges, to which we owe deference, and adopts\nwholesale the government advocate’s view of events. The\ncareful findings and conclusions of the three distinguished\ndistrict judges who all rejected the government’s position are\ncompletely supported by the voluminous record.\n\n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                               I\n\n  The investigation in this case ostensibly involved Bay Area\nLab Co-Operative, popularly referenced as “Balco.” The gov-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1139\nernment suspected Balco of distributing illegal steroids to cer-\ntain athletes, including some Major League Baseball players.\nThe government knew that, pursuant to a collective bargain-\ning agreement between the Major League Baseball Players\nAssociation (“Players Association” or “MLBPA”) and Major\nLeague Baseball, confidential testing had been analyzed by\nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc. (“CDT”), and other labora-\ntories, for the sole purpose of determining whether Major\nLeague Baseball should adopt an individualized steroid test-\ning program.\n\n   Through the collective bargaining agreement, the players\nwere assured that the testing would be anonymous and confi-\ndential, and that the samples and individual data would be\ndestroyed upon tabulation of the results. The only object of\nthe exercise was to determine the approximate magnitude of\napparent steroid use with the goal of fashioning appropriate\npolicies to address it. The collective bargaining agreement\nacknowledged and anticipated that the tests for some players\nmight well yield positive results due to the ingestion of legal\nand proper over-the-counter supplements.\n\n   Although information developed by the government in its\ncriminal investigation pointed only to specific individuals\nwho might be involved with Balco, the government served a\ngrand jury subpoena on CDT on January 16, 2003, seeking\ndrug tests for all major league baseball players. After receiv-\ning the subpoena, the Players Association and CDT contacted\nthe United States Attorneys’ Office to discuss their concerns\nwith the breadth of the subpoena. At the government’s\nrequest, the Players Association, CDT, and Major League\nBaseball prepared and presented a “white paper” to the gov-\nernment detailing the provisions of the collective bargaining\nagreement pertaining to testing, with emphasis on the many\nconfidentiality provisions, and raising concerns about the\ninvasion of the constitutionally-protected privacy interests of\nthe players who were not involved in the Balco investigation.\n\f1140     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The Players Association and CDT assured the government\nin writing that CDT would maintain all of the subpoenaed\nrecords until the disputes were resolved by negotiation or liti-\ngation. On February 4, 2003, the Chief of the Criminal Divi-\nsion wrote the counsel for CDT indicating that the\ngovernment had accepted the assurances by CDT that none of\nthe materials sought by the subpoena would be destroyed or\naltered pending the government’s reconsideration of the sub-\npoena and a motion to quash the subpoena, if filed.\n\n   On February 12, 2004, the grand jury returned a 42-count\nindictment against Victor Conte, Jr. (Balco’s founder), James\nJ. Valente (Balco’s Vice President), Greg F. Anderson (a\ntrainer), and Remi Korchemny (a track coach). The charges\nagainst the defendants included conspiracy to possess with\nintent to distribute anabolic steroids, possession with intent to\ndistribute anabolic steroids, introduction and delivery of mis-\nbranded drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud,\nand misbranding of drugs held for sale with intent to defraud.\n\n   On March 3, the government served a second grand jury\nsubpoena on CDT, seeking information on only eleven named\nbaseball players. However, it did not withdraw the January 16\nsubpoena. On April 7, with no compromise reached and with\na return date passed, the Players Association filed a motion in\nthe Northern District of California in San Francisco to quash\nthe CDT subpoena. The motion was assigned to Judge Jeffrey\nS. White.\n\n   After learning that a motion to quash would be filed but\nbefore the motion could be heard, the government applied for\na search warrant to search the CDT offices for the same infor-\nmation it was seeking in the grand jury subpoena. The search\nwarrant application was made some 240 miles away in\nanother federal judicial district, without notice to the Players\nAssociation or to the district court in the Northern District of\nCalifornia.\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1141\n   In the search warrant proceedings in the Central District of\nCalifornia, the government never brought to the magistrate\njudge’s attention that there was a motion pending before\nJudge White in the Northern District of California to quash\nthe grand jury subpoena. The affidavit did not disclose that\nthe Players Association had joined the motion. Rather, the\naffidavit stated:\n\n      The referenced grand jury subpoena, for the items\n      listed in Attachment B, was issued; however, while\n      not denying that they have the requested materials,\n      CDT has declined to comply with the subpoena and\n      has stated its intent to attempt to quash the subpoena.1\n\n   The affidavit did not disclose that CDT had agreed in writ-\ning to keep the data and other materials secured until the\nscope of the grand jury subpoena was settled, either through\nnegotiation or a ruling on a motion to quash. Rather, the affi-\ndavit justified removing computer data and equipment from\nthe searched premises on the basis that the computer data\ncould be concealed, altered, or destroyed by the user.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n  1\n    Some months later, Judge Illston asked the government: “Did you\nexplain to Judge Johnson what was happening before Judge White, even\non the day that you got him to issue the warrant?” Government counsel\nreplied, “We did inform Judge Johnson of the existence of the grand jury\nsubpoena and it’s in the warrant application of Judge Johnson that defense\nhad indicated that it wanted to move to quash the subpoena. So we did\nindicate to Judge Johnson there was a disputed grand jury issue. Yes, it\nwas disclosed to Judge Johnson.” Neither the warrant application nor the\naffidavit filed in support of the application contain any reference to pend-\ning proceedings before Judge White.\n\f1142     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The government did not have any evidence or reason to\nbelieve that CDT had engaged in steganography, booby-\ntrapping computers, or any type of data destruction or alter-\nation. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing CDT’s assur-\nances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all materials\ncalled for by the first subpoena as well as any materials called\nfor by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would not destroy\nor alter any of the materials called for by either of the subpoe-\nnas.” However, the plain import of the application was that\nCDT was improperly resisting compliance with a valid grand\njury subpoena and data was in jeopardy of being destroyed.\n\n   Based on the government’s application, a search warrant\nwas issued by Magistrate Judge Jeffrey W. Johnson in the\nCentral District of California in Los Angeles. The warrant\nauthorized the seizure of records regarding drug specimens,\ntesting, and test results of only ten specifically named Major\nLeague baseball players. The warrant also provided that if the\ncomputer data seized did not fall within any of the items to\nbe seized or was not otherwise legally seized, the government\nwould return the data. The affidavit provided by Special\nAgent Novitzky in support of the issuance of the warrants\nstated that obtaining information to link the test results to\nindividual players was necessary “to ensure that samples of\nindividuals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed.”\n\n   The warrant was issued one day after the motion to quash\nthe grand jury subpoena had been filed in the Northern Dis-\ntrict of California—creating the clear implication that the gov-\nernment was attempting to prevent Judge White from\nconsidering the motion to quash on the merits by seizing the\nproperty after ex parte presentation to another judge. Upon\narrival at the premises of CDT on the morning of the search,\nSpecial Agent Novitzky and other agents discussed with\nCDT’s attorney the need to search CDT’s computers.\n\n   The information sought in the search warrant was contained\nin three places: a segregated list only containing information\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1143\nabout the ten athletes that were the subjects of the search war-\nrant; a master list of the drug test results for all Major League\nBaseball players; and a computer directory (often referred to\nas the “Tracey directory”) that contained information and\nmedical test results for hundreds of other baseball players and\nathletes engaged in professional sports. Counsel for CDT\nrequested that all material pertaining to the specific items\nlisted in the warrant be reviewed and redacted by a magistrate\njudge or special master before it was seen by the government,\npursuant to the proper procedure described in Tamura. The\ngovernment refused the request.2 The government also\nrejected CDT’s offer to provide the records it had already seg-\nregated concerning the small subset of players at issue.\n\n   In addition to the segregated materials, the government\nseized the master list, all of the voluminous data in the Tracey\nDirectory, lists of teams and players and drug testing details,\nand eleven diskettes, all of which contained drug-test results\non hundreds of Major League Baseball players and other ath-\nletes. The agents searching the Tracey directory at the scene\nconcluded that certain of the subdirectories appeared to con-\ntain information not called for by the warrant. In fact, the\ndirectory contained 2,911 files that had nothing to do with\nMajor League Baseball drug testing, but rather contained test\nresults for numerous other sports entities and business organi-\nzations. However, instead of copying only the subdirectories\nthat pertained to Major League Baseball, the agents copied the\nentire directory. Dr. Jean Joseph of CDT later stated in an\naffidavit that the directory was easily searched by key word\nand would have provided the test information about the ten\nplayers in a short period of time.\n\n  Judge Cooper later specifically found that “[o]nce the items\n  2\n    Department of Justice Guidelines provide that, in cases involving con-\nfidential patient information, a search warrant “shall be executed in such\na manner as to minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, scrutiny of\nconfidential materials.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4(b)(4).\n\f1144    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nwere seized the requirement of the search warrant that any\nseized items not covered by the warrant be first screened and\nsegregated by computer personnel was completely ignored.”\nShe further found that Agent Novitzky himself reviewed the\nseized computer data and used what he learned to obtain the\nsubsequent search warrants issued in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, the Central District of California, and Nevada.\n\n  After the initial search, and based on the search results, the\ngovernment sought and obtained that day a second search\nwarrant from Magistrate Judge Johnson for a search of a stor-\nage facility maintained by CDT.\n\n   On the same day, the government also applied for a search\nwarrant in the District of Nevada. The warrant sought infor-\nmation in the business files of Quest Diagnostics, Inc., a labo-\nratory that had also been involved in the administration of\nMajor League Baseball’s drug testing program in 2003. The\nwarrant was limited to information concerning the ten base-\nball players identified in the Los Angles search warrant. The\naffidavit filed in support of the warrant did not disclose the\nhistory of the issuance of the grand jury subpoena or the filing\nof a motion to quash the subpoena. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Lawrence\nLeavitt issued the warrant, and the warrant was executed.\n\n   On April 9, 2004, the Players Association arranged an\nemergency hearing before Judge White, before whom the\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena was pending. The\nPlayers Association sought an order restricting the govern-\nment from disseminating any information it had obtained until\nthe Players Association had an opportunity to litigate the\nmotion to quash or a Rule 41 motion to return the seized prop-\nerty. The government argued that Judge White had no juris-\ndiction over the items seized pursuant to the search warrants,\neven though the grand jury subpoena sought the same materi-\nals.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1145\n   The government represented to the court that it would not\ndisseminate the information and would negotiate in good faith\nabout the seized items. Judge White accepted that representa-\ntion. He noted that he did not have jurisdiction over the items\nseized pursuant to the warrants, but that the motions to quash\nthe grand jury subpoenas remained pending before him. Judge\nWhite acknowledged that the position of the Players Associa-\ntion was “well taken with respect to the U.S. Attorney’s man-\nual and the government allegedly not following proper\nprocedure,” but that the Players Association had other avail-\nable remedies to resolve that issue on the merits.\n\n   On April 22, 2004, the government wrote CDT indicating\nthat it was withdrawing the January 16, 2004, subpoena and\nmodifying the subpoena of March 3, 2004. The government\ndid not inform Judge White of these actions and the January\n16 subpoena was never withdrawn.\n\n   On April 24, CDT and the Players Association filed a\nmotion in the Central District of California for return of the\nseized property or, in the alternative, appointment of a special\nmaster to redact those records so that the government retained\ndrug test results for only the ten players named in the warrant.\n\n   On April 30, 2004, the government filed its opposition to\nthe motion to return property in the Central District. In its\nopposition, despite the existence of an agreement with CDT\nthat CDT would not destroy or alter documents, the govern-\nment argued that it “had good-faith reasons to believe that\nCDT was detrimentally delaying the investigation, and that\nthere was some danger of the sought-after records being jeop-\nardized.” The government also argued that this jeopardy justi-\nfied proceeding with a search warrant under DOJ guidelines.\n\n  On the same date, April 30, 2004, based on what it had\nfound in the first search, the government sought a new search\nwarrant in the Northern District of California in San Jose for\nCDT electronic files it already had in its possession in the\n\f1146     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nTracey Directory concerning all players whose test results\nwere positive.\n\n   In contrast to the affidavit supplied in the first warrant\napplication, which purported “to ensure that samples of indi-\nviduals not associated with Balco are left undisturbed,” the\naffidavit of Agent Novitzky in support of this warrant applica-\ntion sought “authorization to conduct a thorough review of all\nmajor league baseball-related computer data” and “to seize all\ndata pertaining to illegal drug use by any member of major\nleague baseball.”\n\n   The affidavit conceded that no specific information had\nbeen uncovered linking Balco to any individual baseball play-\ners beyond the ten listed in the April 7, 2004, search warrant.\nHowever, in contrast to the first warrant application, Agent\nNovitzky averred that even though no evidence had been\ndeveloped to link the ballplayers who were not listed in the\nfirst warrant to Balco, “it is logical to assume that a review\nof the drug testing records for other players may provide addi-\ntional evidence of the use of similar illegal performance-\nenhancing drugs which establishes a link to the charged\ndefendants in the charged [Balco] case, given the relatively\nsmall number of professional baseball players and the closely-\nknit professional baseball community.”\n\n   The affidavit in support of issuance of the warrant did not\ndisclose that a grand jury subpoena had been issued for the\nsame material and that a motion to quash the subpoena was\npending in the very same district.\n\n   The affidavit also did not disclose that the parties were liti-\ngating in the Central District of California a motion for return\nof the seized property — the very property which was subject\nof the new search warrant request. Based on the information\nprovided by the government, Magistrate Judge Howard W.\nLloyd issued a new search warrant for the same material that\nthe government had already searched and seized.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1147\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the District of Nevada for information contained in the files\nat Quest Diagnostics concerning all baseball players who,\naccording to the information collected in the CDT search, had\ntested positive for steroids. The application conceded that\nthere was no specific evidence linking these players to Balco.\nThe warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge Leavitt. The gov-\nernment took a large number (later reported by the govern-\nment to be 250 to 300 because of multiple samples given by\nthe players) of physical samples of bodily fluids and trans-\nported them to a lab in Los Angeles.\n\n   On May 5, 2004, the government sought a search warrant\nin the Central District of California in Los Angeles before a\ndifferent magistrate judge for all information contained in the\nfiles at CDT concerning all baseball players who, according\nto the information collected in the CDT search, had a positive\nmarker for steroids. The application conceded that there was\nno specific evidence linking these players to Balco. Neither\nthe application nor the affidavit filed in support of the applica-\ntion disclosed the pending proceedings concerning the grand\njury subpoenas. Based on the information provided by the\ngovernment, the warrant was issued by Magistrate Judge\nRosalyn Chapman.\n\n   On May 6, 2004, after it had executed the search warrants,\nthe government served grand jury subpoenas on CDT and\nQuest for the same materials it had sought in the April 30 and\nMay 5 search warrants. The subpoena contained the names of\nthe baseball players that had allegedly tested positive, even\nthough the government knew that the information Quest pos-\nsessed was only identifiable by number and even though the\ngovernment had assured the Players Association and Judge\nWhite that it would not disclose the names. The government\nsent a letter to Quest Diagnostics instructing the company not\nto disclose to anyone the government’s request for documents\n“indefinitely” because “[a]ny such disclosure could impede\n\f1148    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nthe investigation being conducted and thereby interfere with\nthe enforcement of the law.”\n\n   On May 21, 2004, CDT and the Players Association filed\na motion in the District of Nevada for a return of the property\nseized from Quest Diagnostics. On June 7, 2004, CDT and the\nPlayers Association filed a motion in the Northern District of\nCalifornia for return of the electronic documents seized from\nCDT pursuant to the April 30 search warrant issued by Magis-\ntrate Judge Lloyd in the Northern District.\n\n   On July 9, 2004, Judge White held a hearing on the motion\nto quash the grand jury subpoenas, but deferred action pend-\ning rulings on the motions for return of property seized pursu-\nant to the search warrants.\n\n   On August 9, 2004, Judge Susan Illston held a hearing on\nthe motion for return of the electronic data seized by the gov-\nernment pursuant to the April 30 warrant. When asked by\nJudge Illston why the government hadn’t just waited to let\nJudge White rule on the motions to quash the grand jury sub-\npoena rather than seeking search warrants for the same mate-\nrial, the government responded:\n\n    What the government really perceived ultimately as\n    a conscious decision on the part of the Major League\n    Baseball Players Association and the other parties\n    associated with it just refused to comply with what\n    the government felt was [sic] legitimate grand jury\n    subpoenas.\n\n   Later in the hearing the government argued that the search\nwarrant was necessary because a motion to quash had been\nfiled.\n\n    Counsel: The concern here was, to say, okay, we’re\n             going to face a brick wall from this legal\n             avenue . . . .\n\f           UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING               1149\n      Judge:      What brick wall?\n\n      Counsel: The brick wall was . . .\n\n      Judge:      Judge White?\n\n      Counsel: No, no, not at all. It was the concern that\n               the requests or that discussions about\n               moving to quash the subpoena would be\n               something that would be dragged out.\n\n   At a later hearing, counsel for government confirmed that\nit would not have sought to obtain the search warrants if the\naffected parties had not filed a motion to quash the grand jury\nsubpoena.3 However, the Department of Justice Guidelines\nprovide that “The fact that the disinterested third party pos-\nsessing the materials may have grounds to challenge a sub-\npoena or other legal process is not in itself a legitimate basis\nfor the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R. § 59.4.\n\n  The government primarily argued that, even though the\nmaterial seized may not have been authorized under the\nsearch warrant, seizure was appropriate under the “plain\n  3\n   A hearing on December 10, 2004, discussed infra, contains this collo-\nquy:\n      Counsel:   And the government never would have done the\n                 search warrants if the grand jury process could have\n                 worked out. But it didn’t. I feel —\n      Court:     Say that last thing one more time. What you —\n      Counsel:   What I just said was we may not have ever done the\n                 search warrants if the subpoena process worked out.\n      Court:     But, I mean, there was a subpoena process pending in\n                 this building before Judge White.\n      Counsel:   Yes.\n      Court:     At the time you went and got your search warrants,\n                 and you didn’t allow that process to complete itself.\n      Counsel:   That is true.\n\f1150     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nview” doctrine. The court engaged in an extensive colloquy\nabout the search, ascertaining that the data was contained in\na file that could not be accessed readily without assistance,\nand that the agent had to scroll through 1,200 results to obtain\nthe positive tests that formed the basis of the later search war-\nrants. After noting that the government had not provided any\ncase to support its contention that the plain view doctrine\napplied in the computer context, Judge Illston made the fol-\nlowing findings:\n\n    I find absolutely staggering the implications about\n    what you say about the plain view doctrine in the\n    computer set up. In a way nothing is in plain view\n    because with the disk you look at it, you don’t see\n    anything until you stick it in the computer and it\n    does take quite a lot of work really to bring it up on\n    the screen.\n\n    So, it’s not in plain view in the sense of walking into\n    the room and seeing the scale on the desk. It takes\n    a whole lot of work to get there.\n\n    First off, none of it is cursory, there are whole indus-\n    tries that have developed in order to make it possible\n    for the disk to show up on the screen that way. So\n    it’s not cursory review. I don’t think it’s plain view.\n    I don’t think I have to go that far or make that kind\n    of choice with respect to issues that are certainly\n    going to arise. . . . Where it requires sorting through\n    information which really is on a data base, somehow\n    it’s being organized in different formats, you could\n    organize it in a format based on the ten names,\n    instead of taking it in other kinds of formats, then\n    scrolling across and taking names and information\n    off the screen, when it’s clearly information that\n    isn’t part of what was originally within the autho-\n    rized search warrant, I just think is impermissible.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1151\n  Judge Illston then granted the motion for return of seized\nproperty, with the following findings from the bench:\n\n       So, having looked at the Ramsden factors set out,\n    [there are] apparently four factors. One, whether the\n    government displayed a callous disregard for the\n    constitutional rights, two, whether the [movant] has\n    an individual right and need for the property he\n    wants returned, three, whether the [movant] would\n    be irreparably injured by denying the motion for\n    return of property, and four, whether the [movant]\n    has an adequate remedy at law for a redress of his\n    grievance. I find all four factors have been met here.\n\n       I think the government has displayed, in the chro-\n    nology of things that we’ve seen, in the way that the\n    case was taken from one judge to another judge, in\n    the way that as soon as it was challenged in one\n    court, it was immediately litigated in another court\n    without full information being shared among the\n    courts, that to me makes it a callous disregard for\n    constitutional rights. I think, it’s a seizure beyond\n    what was authorized by the search warrant, therefore\n    it violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n       Number two, I think [that both movants] here\n    have an interest and need for the property returned.\n    I think they need it returned and not so much\n    because they need it back, they got it, you got it, I\n    think what they need to get back from you what they\n    have, what you’ve taken from them because of the\n    privacy rights and the circumstances under which\n    this material was given.\n\n       Whether the [movant] would be irreparably\n    injured by denying the return of the property, I think\n    they would, and I think indeed there would be, that\n    the injury that will be suffered by volunteers not\n\f1152     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    being able to confidently provide testing under\n    promise of privacy would irreparably injure not only\n    major league baseball, I can’t imagine that there’s\n    going to be any voluntary agreement to do this kind\n    of testing, that’s probably over with already, but also\n    just has implications that are very negative for these\n    [movants], and whether the [movant] has an ade-\n    quate remedy at law, I don’t think there is any rem-\n    edy at law for the redress of these grievances.\n\n  I’m going to grant the motion.\n\n   On August 13, in the Central District of California, Magis-\ntrate Judge Johnson issued a report and recommendation rec-\nommending denial of the motion for return of property seized\nat CDT.\n\n   On August 19, in the District of Nevada, Judge James C.\nMahan held a hearing on the motion filed by the Players\nAssociation for the return of the property seized at Quest\nDiagnostics pursuant to the search warrants. The government\ndid not disclose to Judge Mahan or the Players Association\nthat it had served on Quest a grand jury subpoena for the same\nmaterials, coupled with a letter instructing Quest to keep that\nfact confidential indefinitely. At the conclusion of the hearing,\nJudge Mahan orally granted the motion. On September 7,\nJudge Mahan filed a written order granting the motion for\nreturn of the property. Judge Mahan found, in relevant part,\nthat:\n\n    2.   Under Ramsden v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628126\"><a href=\"/opinion/628126/terence-philip-ramsden-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n         (9th Cir. 1993), this Court has equitable jurisdic-\n         tion to order return of that seized property. All\n         of the factors identified in Ramsden supporting\n         jurisdiction are present. The government cal-\n         lously disregarded the affected players’ constitu-\n         tional rights. The MLBPA, as representative for\n         the players, has an individual interest in and\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1153\n         need for the property that it wants returned. The\n         MLBPA would be irreparably injured if the\n         property were not returned. And the MLBPA\n         has no adequate remedy at law for redress of the\n         grievances.\n\n    3.   Under the particular circumstances of this case,\n         it was unreasonable for the Government to\n         refuse to follow the procedures set forth in\n         United States v. Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n         1982), upon learning that drug-testing records\n         for the ten athletes named in the original April\n         8 warrants executed at Quest and at Comprehen-\n         sive Drug Testing, Inc. were co-mingled with\n         records for other athletes not named in those\n         warrants.\n\n   After issuance of the order, the government declined to\nreturn the material seized from Quest in Nevada, contending\nit was entitled to retain it under the authority of the new May\n6 grand jury subpoena. To that end, the government filed a\nstay motion with Judge Mahan, arguing that it had a right to\nretain the data and samples based on the May 6 grand jury\nsubpoena, which had issued after the seizures of the material\nhad occurred. The government argued that Judge White was\nthe only judge who had jurisdiction to decide that issue. Judge\nMahan denied the stay motion. The government maintained\nthat the May 6 grand jury subpoenas independently authorized\nretention of the data and specimens; therefore, the Players\nAssociation and CDT filed a motion to quash the May 6 sub-\npoena in the Northern District of California.\n\n   On October 1, 2004, in the Central District of California,\nJudge Cooper declined to adopt Magistrate Judge Johnson’s\nrecommendation, and granted the motion for return of the\nseized CDT property. She noted that she joined “an appar-\nently ever-increasing number of district judges who have held\nthat the Government’s execution of the Search Warrant at\n\f1154    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nissue in this case demonstrated a callous disregard for the con-\nstitutional rights of the movants and their members.”\n\n  With respect to the Ramsden factors, Judge Cooper found:\n\n       All four considerations weigh in favor of the mov-\n    ing parties in this case. In assessing whether the gov-\n    ernment displayed a callous disregard for the rights\n    of the persons whose records were seized, it is\n    important to focus on the Ninth Circuit opinion in\n    United States v. Tamura, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411427\"><a href=\"/opinion/411427/united-states-v-leigh-raymond-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982). At\n    the time of the search, Tamura was certainly settled\n    law in the Circuit, and Tamura establishes a proce-\n    dure to be followed when documents to be seized are\n    intermingled with other documents. “. . . . [T]he\n    wholesale seizure for later detained examination of\n    records not described in a warrant is significantly\n    more intrusive, and has been characterized as ‘the\n    kind of investigatory dragnet that the fourth amend-\n    ment was designed to prevent.’[citation].” Id. at 595.\n    Therefore, law enforcement officials are to seal and\n    hold such intermingled documents “pending\n    approval by a magistrate of a further search . . . .\n    Wholesale removal must be monitored by the judg-\n    ment of a neutral, detached magistrate.” Id. at 596.\n    It is particularly telling in this case that just such a\n    procedure was proposed to the Government at the\n    time of the search, and rejected.\n\n       Nor is the viewing of the seized files legitimized\n    by the Plain View doctrine. Under the exception to\n    the warrant requirement, an officer may seize what\n    he plainly views, so long as he has a lawful right to\n    access the evidence itself and its incriminating char-\n    acter is immediately apparent. Horton v. California,\n    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 136 (1990). Here, the agent did not\n    have a lawful right to access the computer records\n    and diskettes, and, as evidence provided in connec-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1155\n    tion with the Motion reveals, the evidence observed\n    is not necessarily incriminating. The Declaration of\n    Dr. Joseph states that the ingestion of nutritional\n    supplements can produce a “positive” test for ste-\n    roids.\n\n       The Government demonstrated a callous disregard\n    for the rights of persons whose records were seized\n    and searched outside the warrants.\n\n       The second consideration, whether the moving\n    party has an interest and need for return of the prop-\n    erty, is easily answered. The athletes in question vol-\n    untarily submitted to urine testing for steroids, as\n    part of an agreement that all results would remain\n    confidential and be used only for statistical analysis.\n    Their interest in privacy is obvious.\n\n       The third consideration, whether the moving party\n    has an interest and need for return of the property is\n    easily answered. The careers of these athletes could\n    be profoundly, negatively affected by release of\n    these records, and their return is vitally important.\n    The harm they would suffer if the records were\n    released (even if the positive tests are shown to be\n    innocuous) would be irreparable.\n\n       Finally, it is evident that the movants have no\n    other legal remedy. No motion to suppress the evi-\n    dence is available to them; they are neither defen-\n    dants nor suspects, and no case exists in which this\n    issue could be litigated.\n\n  In addition to her findings and conclusions, Judge Cooper\nadded these comments in a section labeled “Serious Con-\ncerns:”\n\n       The documents presented to the Court in connec-\n    tion with this Motion reveal extremely troubling\n\f1156    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    conduct on the part of the Government. The picture\n    painted is one of almost desperate effort to acquire\n    evidence by whatever means could be utilized. The\n    Government negotiated with movants’ attorneys\n    over the breadth of the grand jury subpoenas;\n    received assurances in writing that the records of the\n    ten athletes would be secured while the Court\n    resolved the issue, and the day after the issue was\n    presented to a Court, went to another district and\n    sought a search warrant. That conduct would be sus-\n    pect in itself. But in seeking the warrant (not the cor-\n    rect procedure for obtaining documents for a third\n    party who is not a suspect), the Government\n    explained to the Magistrate that the records in ques-\n    tion were in danger of being destroyed. This is bla-\n    tant misrepresentation, as demonstrated by the\n    records in this case.\n\n       Four days after Movants filed a motion before\n    Magistrate Judge Johnson for return of the property,\n    the Government obtained a further warrant from a\n    Magistrate Judge in the Northern District of Califor-\n    nia. And while a motion for return of that property\n    was pending, the Government obtained two more\n    warrants in the Central District of California (not\n    from Magistrate Judge Johnson) and in Nevada. The\n    image of quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no\n    one can find the pea would be humorous if the mat-\n    ter were not so serious.\n\n   Noting that “the Government is held to a far higher stan-\ndard than has been demonstrated in this case,” and that “this\nis the third District Court Order compelling the Government\nto return property illegally seized,” Judge Cooper ordered\nreturn of the seized CDT property forthwith.\n\n  On December 10, 2004, Judge Illston held a hearing on the\nPlayers Association motion to intervene and to quash the May\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1157\n6, 2004 grand jury subpoenas served on CDT and Quest. At\nthe conclusion of the hearing, Judge Illston made the follow-\ning oral findings and conclusions:\n\n       I find that the MLBPA has the right to intervene\n    in this matter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n    24(a), as it has an interest in the samples and test\n    results in the possession of CDT and Quest, which\n    were created with the promise of anonymity under\n    the mandatory testing of the 2002 collective bargain-\n    ing agreement.\n\n       The May 6th, 2004 subpoenas were the culmina-\n    tion of a series of actions taken by the government\n    in order to prevent MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to\n    move to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n    Instead of allowing the matter to be resolved in a sin-\n    gle proceeding before Judge White, the government\n    executed a series of search warrants in three different\n    districts once it learned that petitioners would move\n    to quash the January and March subpoenas.\n\n       The government has provided no substantial\n    explanation of why this course of action was neces-\n    sary. Given that the government had no other basis\n    for issuing the April search warrants and preempting\n    the subpoenas served on Quest and CDT, the deci-\n    sion appears to have been a tactical decision to pre-\n    vent the parties from raising objections before Judge\n    White, which is unreasonable and constitutes harass-\n    ment similar to the conduct in United States v. Amer-\n    ican Honda.\n\n       Furthermore, the May 6th subpoenas were served\n    after the government had obtained evidence pursuant\n    to the April 7 and April 30 search warrants, which\n    has now been determined to have been illegally\n    seized. Some of the information sought in the May\n\f1158     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    6th subpoena was already in the government’s pos-\n    session at the time the subpoena was served on CDT\n    and Quest; therefore, the Court finds that the May\n    6th subpoena served as an unreasonable insurance\n    policy as recognized in the motion for the return of\n    seized property cited in the papers, 681 F.Supp. [sic]\n\n      For these reasons the court grants petitioner’s\n    motion to quash the May 6th subpoena served on\n    Quest and CDT as an abuse of the grand jury process\n    and unreasonable under Federal Rule of Criminal\n    Procedure 17(c).\n\n   On October 18, 2005, as a result of a plea agreement, Balco\nfounder Victor Conte received a sentence of eight months\nimprisonment, with four months of the sentence to be served\nin home confinement. James Valente, Balco’s vice president,\nwas sentenced to probation. Trainer Greg Anderson was sen-\ntenced to six months imprisonment, with three of the six\nmonths to be spent in home confinement. On February 25,\n2006, track coach Remi Korchemny was sentenced to one\nyear of probation.\n\n   In reviewing both the order quashing the grand jury sub-\npoena and the orders granting the motions for return of prop-\nerty pursuant to Fed.

Here, there is no doubt the dis-\ntrict courts weighed the appropriate factors pertaining to the\nRule 41(g) motion and elected to exercise equitable power to\nreturn property. There is also no doubt that Judge Illston\nbased her decision on the motion to quash on a correct view\nof the law and appropriately considered all of the evidence. In\nre Grand Jury Subpoena, 383 F.3d at 909. On appellate\nreview, we cannot say that these judges abused the discretion\nreposed in them.\n\n   The majority chooses instead to substitute its own factual\nfindings concerning the government’s compliance with the\nwarrants and interpose its own de novo opinion as to the exer-\ncise of discretion. That is not our function. In addition, our\nappellate review ought to be significantly more deferential\nwhen we confront the uniform factual findings and collective\nexercise of judicial discretion of three experienced district\njudges from three separate judicial districts. However,\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1161\nbecause our deferential standards of review were discarded in\nthis case, I will proceed to a merits discussion.\n\n                                    IV\n\n   I agree with the majority that Judge Mahan properly exer-\ncised equitable jurisdiction over the Rule 41(g) motions.5\nRamsden identified four factors that district courts must con-\nsider before exercising equitable jurisdiction to order the\nreturn of property, namely whether: (1) the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant; (2) the movant has an individual interest in and the\nneed for the property he wants returned; (3) the movant would\nbe irreparably injured by denying return of the property; and\n(4) the movant has an adequate remedy at law for the redress\nof his grievance. 2 F.3d at 324.\n\n   Although I agree with the majority that the district courts\nproperly exercised equitable jurisdiction, I disagree with the\nmajority’s analysis in reaching that conclusion. Because the\nequitable jurisdictional analysis in large part drives the analy-\nsis of the merits of the Rule 41(g) decisions, it is important\nto detail my differences with the majority on this issue.\n  5\n    Because Judge Cooper’s order is not reviewable, like the majority, I\nreview only Judge Mahan’s order in this section. However, the legal anal-\nysis applicable to both orders is largely the same. Further, Judge Cooper’s\nconclusive determination that the materials seized from CDT must be\nreturned because they were taken in callous disregard of the non-Balco\nplayers’ constitutional rights has an impact on the validity of Judge\nMahan’s order. Since the CDT materials were a necessary prerequisite for\nthe granting of the Quest search warrant, the fact that those materials were\nimproperly seized removes the foundation for the legality of the Quest\nwarrant. Although the Quest warrant is not directly challenged in this case,\nI address below how the final order from Judge Cooper also serves to sup-\nport the result reached by Judge Mahan.\n\f1162     UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n                               A\n\n   The first Ramsden factor is whether the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovant. The majority concludes the government did not. I\nrespectfully disagree with that conclusion. The record entirely\nsupports Judge Mahan’s conclusion that the government dis-\nplayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the\nmovants.\n\n                               1\n\n   The doctrine of issue preclusion requires us to accept as\ndecided that the government callously disregarded the non-\nBalco players’ rights when it seized those players’ records\nfrom CDT.

Judge Cooper ordered\nthe CDT-seized property returned, holding that the govern-\nment demonstrated a callous disregard for the constitutional\nrights of the movants and their members. That holding, now\nfinal, is entitled to res judicata effect. Because the affidavit\nsubmitted to Magistrate Judge Leavitt that formed the basis\nfor the May 5, 2004, Quest search warrant relied on the mate-\nrials Judge Cooper has now conclusively determined were\nseized in callous violation of the players’ rights, the materials\nseized pursuant to the May 5 warrant are fruit of that poison-\nous tree.

In Silver-\nthorne Lumber, the Court considered a situation akin to the\none at bar. In describing the government’s argument in that\ncase, the Court wrote:\n\n    The proposition could not be presented more\n    nakedly. It is that although of course its seizure was\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1163\n      an outrage which the Government now regrets, it\n      may study the papers before it returns them, copy\n      them, and then may use the knowledge it has gained\n      to call upon the owners in a more regular form to\n      produce them; that the protection of the Constitution\n      covers the physical possession but not any advan-\n      tages that the Government can gain over the object\n      of its pursuit by doing the forbidden act.\n\n251 U.S. at 391.\n\n   The Supreme Court forcefully rejected this idea, stating\nthat adoption of such a theory would “reduce[ ] the Fourth\nAmendment to a form of words.” Id. at 392.\n\n  The Court concluded:\n\n      The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition\n      of evidence in a certain way is that not merely the\n      evidence so acquired shall not be used before the\n      Court but that it shall not be used at all.\n\nId.\n\n   Judge Cooper declared the seizures illegal and ordered the\nmaterial returned. That binding decision means that the gov-\nernment could not use the fruits of the search to justify its\nsubsequent search in Nevada. The majority fails to explain\nhow the government can disregard the players rights in seiz-\ning the spreadsheet from CDT, but not disregard their rights\nin using that spreadsheet to seize the urine samples them-\nselves from Quest.\n\n                               2\n\n  Even notwithstanding any preclusive effect stemming from\nJudge Cooper’s order, the record more than amply supports\nJudge Mahan’s ruling on its own merits.\n\f1164      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The record supports the conclusion that the government\nsought and executed the search warrants and took subsequent\nlegal action as a tactical measure to prevent the Players Asso-\nciation and CDT from litigating their motion to quash and\nother objections to the wholesale production of CDT data and\nthus the Quest data that the CDT materials begot.6 The gov-\nernment applied for, and executed, the initial search warrants\nafter CDT and the Players Association informed the govern-\nment they would be filing a motion to quash the grand jury\nsubpoenas. Government counsel conceded on the record that\nthe motivation for seeking the search warrants was the “brick\nwall” presented by the filing of the motions to quash, even\nthough DOJ guidelines state that “[t]he fact that the disinter-\nested third party possessing the materials may have grounds\nto challenge a subpoena or other legal process is not in itself\na legitimate basis for the use of a search warrant.” 28 C.F.R.\n§ 59.4.\n\n   The majority points out that the DOJ guidelines do not give\nrise to substantive rights. That may be so, but it is beside the\npoint. The guidelines form a baseline from which to judge the\nreasonableness of unjustified deviations from the standard\npractices they outline. The guidelines are certainly relevant to\nthe question before the district court, namely whether the gov-\nernment exhibited callous disregard for the rights of third par-\nties. The guidelines plainly state that it is not legitimate to use\na search warrant because a party may be challenging a sub-\npoena; the government admitted that this was precisely the\nreason it issued the warrants in this case.\n\n   Further, as Judge Cooper found, the use of a search warrant\nto obtain documents from a third party is inappropriate. The\n  6\n    Although we only have jurisdiction to review Judge Mahan’s order,\nbecause the Quest search warrant was based, in part, on materials seized\nfrom CDT, an analysis of the propriety of the CDT warrants is necessary\nto a full analysis of whether Judge Mahan properly exercised his discre-\ntion in ordering the non-Balco samples seized from Quest returned.\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING            1165\nDepartment of Justice Guidelines address this point specifi-\ncally:\n\n    A search warrant should not be used to obtain docu-\n    mentary materials believed to be in the private pos-\n    session of a disinterested third party unless it appears\n    that the use of a subpoena, summons, request, or\n    other less intrusive alternative means of obtaining\n    the materials would substantially jeopardize the\n    availability or usefulness of the materials sought, and\n    the application for the warrant has been authorized\n    as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n28 C.F.R. § 59.4(a)(1); see also U.S. Attorney’s Manual § 9-\n19.210.\n\n  The U.S. Attorney’s Manual also provides that a search\nwarrant should normally not be used to obtain confidential\nmaterials such as treatment records. §§ 9-19.220, 9-19.230.\n\n   The simple and undisputed fact is that the government\ndeviated from its usual and appropriate protocol. Documents\nheld in the possession of third parties are appropriately\nobtained through use of grand jury subpoena, not search war-\nrant. The record is quite clear that the government used the\nvehicle of a search warrant only because it thought its grand\njury subpoenas might be contested. As the DOJ Guidelines\nrecognize, that is an inappropriate use of a search warrant.\nJudge Mahan was entitled on the basis of the record to find\nthat the government undertook this action in an attempt to\nprevent the Players Association and CDT from litigating the\nmerits of their objections to the grand jury subpoenas and thus\nthat the Quest search warrant was procured via tainted means.\n\n   Further, the entire record of the case shows a repeated pat-\ntern of the government attempting to prevent a full hearing on\nthe merits of the Players Association legal challenges. In vir-\ntually each hearing in which CDT and the Players Association\n\f1166      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\narticulated their objections, the government argued that\nanother court had primary jurisdiction or that the action of\nanother court dictated the result.7 The record supports the dis-\ntrict courts’ collective conclusion that, as Judge Cooper put it,\nthe government’s actions constituted a “desperate effort to\nacquire evidence by whatever means could be utilized,” by\nmeans of “quickly and skillfully moving the cup so no one\ncan find the pea.”\n\n                                     3\n\n   The record also supports the conclusion that the govern-\nment made misleading statements in its application for search\nwarrants and that the actions of the government in executing\nthe search warrants were a mere pretext for inappropriately\nseizing confidential medical data about Major League Base-\nball players who were not under any particularized suspicion\nof criminal activity.\n\n   The application contained lengthy representations about\nhow computer data could be destroyed and stated that “while\nnot denying that they have the requested materials, CDT has\ndeclined to comply with the subpoena and has stated its intent\nto quash the subpoena.” The affidavit did not disclose that\nCDT had agreed in writing to keep the data and other materi-\nals secured until the scope of the grand jury subpoena was set-\n  7\n    To provide but a few examples: Before Judge White, who was consid-\nering the initial motion to quash, the government argued that he should\ndefer ruling because he had no jurisdiction over the materials seized by the\nwarrant. The government urged Judge Illston to wait to decide the Rule\n41(g) motion until Magistrate Judge Johnson had ruled on the separate\nRule 41(g) motion. The government urged Judge Johnson to consider that\nprobable cause had already been established by the issuance of a search\nwarrant by Magistrate Judge Lloyd. The government contended Judge\nMahan lacked jurisdiction to order the property seized under the warrant\nreturned because it had separately obtained a grand jury subpoena for the\nsame item, urging him to wait until Judge White had ruled on the motion\nto quash (not disclosing that it had asked Judge White to defer until the\nRule 41(g) motions had been decided).\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1167\ntled, either through negotiation or a ruling on a motion to\nquash. The affidavit did not disclose that the Chief of the\nCriminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office had\naccepted the assurances in writing.\n\n  Rather, the affidavit justified removing computer data and\nequipment from the searched premises on the basis that:\n\n    Computer users can attempt to conceal data within\n    computer equipment and storage devices through a\n    number of methods, including the use of innocuous\n    or misleading filenames and extensions. . . . Com-\n    puter users can also attempt to conceal data by using\n    encryption, which means that a password or device,\n    such as a “dongle” or “keycard,” is necessary to\n    decrypt the data into readable form. In addition,\n    computer users can conceal data within another\n    seemingly unrelated and innocuous file in a process\n    called “steganography.” For example, by using ste-\n    ganography, a computer user can conceal text in an\n    image file which cannot be viewed when the image\n    file is opened. Therefore, a substantial amount of\n    time is necessary to extract and sort through data that\n    is concealed or encrypted to determine whether it is\n    evidence, contraband or instrumentalities of a crime.\n\n   The affidavit also informed the magistrate judge that\n“[c]omputer hardware and storage devices may contain\n‘booby traps’ that destroy or alter data if certain procedures\nare not scrupulously followed.” It noted that computer data\nwas “particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional\nmodification or destruction.”\n\n   As previously stated, the government did not have any evi-\ndence or reason to believe that CDT had engaged in any of\nthis sort of conduct that might have jeopardized the evidence\nbeing sought. To the contrary, it had accepted in writing\nCDT’s assurances “that CDT will maintain and preserve all\n\f1168    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nmaterials called for by the first subpoena as well as any mate-\nrials called for by the new subpoena” and that “CDT would\nnot destroy or alter any of the materials called for by either\nof the subpoenas.” The plain import of the application was\nthat CDT was improperly resisting compliance with a valid\ngrand jury subpoena and data was in jeopardy of being\ndestroyed. It implied that CDT was not being forthright about\nthe information it possessed, when in fact there was no sug-\ngestion that CDT was attempting to mislead the government\nin any respect.\n\n   The search warrant application did not disclose that the\nPlayers Association, on behalf of the individuals whose medi-\ncal files were at issue, had intervened and had joined CDT’s\nmotion to quash the grand jury subpoena. The application did\nnot disclose the history of negotiations between the parties,\nand that the concern was about the breadth of the subpoena.\nThe application did not disclose that the written assurances\nmade by CDT and accepted by the government contemplated\nresolving the disputed issues through a motion to quash if\nnecessary. Rather, the application implied that CDT was tak-\ning unjustified unilateral action.\n\n   The majority implies that the government constructed a\ncareful search protocol carefully tailored to the CDT opera-\ntion that it presented to the magistrate judges. However, the\naffidavits and protocol incorporate merely boilerplate lan-\nguage. Had the government disclosed to the magistrate judge\nthat it intended, in the course of its search for material on a\nhandful of players, to seize thousands of records pertaining to\nthirteen other major sports organizations, three unaffiliated\nbusiness entities, and three sports competitions, and that the\nentity to be subject to the search had already segregated the\nresponsive information for production, there is no doubt in my\nmind that the reaction of the judge would have been com-\npletely different.\n\n   Given these undisputed facts, the district courts were enti-\ntled to conclude that the government made misleading state-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1169\nments in its applications for search warrants and that the\nactions of the government in executing the search warrants\nwere a mere pretext for inappropriately seizing confidential\nmedical data about Major League Baseball players who were\nnot under any particularized suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n                              4\n\n   Notwithstanding the government’s bold and apparently\ndeceptive tactics, the majority claims the government none-\ntheless complied with the terms of the warrants and therefore\nthat Judge Mahan’s ruling must be reversed.\n\n  First, this contention flies in the face of Judge Cooper’s\nspecific factual finding that the government did not comply\nwith the terms of the warrant. She found that “the requirement\nof the Warrant that the seized items not covered by the war-\nrant be first screened and segregated by computer personnel\nwas completely ignored.” As she elaborated:\n\n    [T]he warrant did not require mere “consultation”\n    and “participation” with computer personnel, but\n    required computer personnel to actually make an ini-\n    tial review of computer equipment and storage\n    devices to determine if they could be searched on-\n    site, to determine whether it was practical to copy\n    the data, and to seize and transport the equipment\n    devices if necessary. The warrant required “appro-\n    priately trained personnel” to review the seized items\n    to determine what data fell within the warrant. This\n    clearly not the role [agent] Abboud played. The\n    Court therefore considered this evidence and found\n    it unconvincing in showing that the Government\n    complied with the warrant.\n\n   Judge Cooper’s factual finding, which we review for clear\nerror, is amply supported by the record.\n\f1170    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   It is undisputed that, in anticipation of responding to the\ngrand jury subpoena, CDT had already segregated the mate-\nrial about the specific individuals that was sought by the gov-\nernment. When agents arrived the President of CDT, Kim\nJasper, informed the government that there was an envelope\nthat contained the drug testing results, executed chain of cus-\ntody forms, and laboratory reports for all ten of the players\nspecified in the search warrant. When Jasper opened the box\nfor the agents, they seized not only the envelope, but also\ncomputer disks and other material. They seized the material\nwithout examining it. One of the disks was completely blank.\n\n   Similarly, another CDT employee had created hard copy\ninformation responsive to the grand jury subpoena, which\nCDT provided to the government. The government wished to\nview the hard drive from which the information derived. CDT\nallowed them access and directed them to the subdirectory in\nthe Tracey Directory were the Major League Baseball drug\ntesting results were kept. The agents not only copied the sub-\ndirectory, but the entire Tracey directory which included\nthousands of obviously irrelevant material. The affidavit sup-\nporting the CDT search warrant explained that, if necessary,\nthe agents could conduct an off-site search. Rather than seize\non any of the opportunities presented to avoid the more-\nintrusive search, the agents proceeded to do everything possi-\nble to assure that result. In addition to rejecting CDT’s offer\nto produce the responsive documents, the agents also declined\nto attempt any keyword searches to isolate responsive docu-\nments on site. The agents also ignored the fact that sub-\ndirectories containing files relevant to Major League Baseball\nwere clearly labeled—as were the many subdirectories con-\ntaining confidential information about other sports\norganizations—and instead seized the entire Tracey Direc-\ntory.\n\n  The majority argues that “[t]he government should not be\nrequired to trust the suspect’s self-labeling when executing a\nwarrant.” But CDT was not a suspect; it was a third party. The\n\f          UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                 1171\nmajority, without any support in the record, goes on to place\nthe independent laboratory in the category of criminal sus-\npects, stating that “[l]ike most searched parties, CDT had an\nincentive to avoid giving over documents of which the gov-\nernment might be unaware and to read the search warrant as\nnarrowly as possible.”8 What the undisputed record indicates\nis that CDT had already segregated the material in anticipa-\ntion of cooperating with the government’s grand jury sub-\npoena; that CDT had assured the government in writing of its\ncooperation; and that the government had accepted those\nassurances. In the end, the proof is in the pudding. After\nexamining all of the massive amount of seized data, after fil-\ning numerous declarations in support of the legitimacy of the\ngovernment’s search, and after much protesting about its sus-\npicions about CDT, the government does not identify a single\npiece of information responsive to the warrant that CDT did\nnot have already segregated and ready for production.\n\n   In short, the so called warrant protocol, relied on by the\nmajority, was completely discarded, as Judge Cooper found.\nThe government did not have a meaningful consultation with\nCDT officials about production of responsive material. It\nengaged in a wholesale dragnet operation indiscriminately\ngathering as much data as it could lay its hands on. The pre-\ntextual nature of the search was highlighted in later govern-\n   8\n     The majority’s unwarranted speculation as to the motivation of profes-\nsional, independent laboratories to conceal information is belied by the\nDOJ Guidelines. Indeed, the DOJ computer search manual contemplates\nthat “[s]ometimes, . . . [a] friendly employee or system administrator may\nagree to pinpoint a file or record or may have a recent backup, permitting\nthe agents to obtain a hard copy of the files they seek while on-site.” See\nComputer Crime & Intellectual Prop.

Rather,\nonce off-site, instead of allowing only technical experts to\nsegregate the responsive from the unresponsive data, the gov-\nernment allowed the lead investigator to peruse all of the\nmaterial in the Tracey Directory, contrary to the specific\ninstructions in the warrant.

To do so completely subverts the\nFourth Amendment warrant requirement and allows the gov-\nernment to obtain post hoc justification for a search for which\nthey had no probable cause to conduct before conducting it.\nSuch a procedure invites an abuse of the off-site process that\nthreatens both the privacy of computer data as well as the\ngovernment’s ability to reasonably search it.\n\n   The majority relies on United States v. Adjani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794809\"><a href=\"/opinion/794809/united-states-v-christopher-lee-adjani-jana-reinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2006), and United States v. Hill, but those deci-\nsions supply no support for a deviation from the Tamura pro-\ncedure. In Adjani, in execution of a lawful warrant,\ninvestigators seized a computer owned by the defendant and\na computer owned by his girlfriend, who was also a suspect.\nIn sustaining the search of her computer, we reasoned that the\ngovernment acts within the scope of the warrant when it\nseizes material that is “both related to the purposes of [the]\nsearch and [is] implicated . . . in the crime.” Id. (emphasis\nadded). Here, the government seized hundreds of records that\nwere clearly outside the scope of the Balco-limited warrant,\nthat were unrelated to the purposes of the Balco-limited\nsearch, and were indicative of no crime whatsoever. The\nmaterials seized at CDT were not related to the purpose of the\nsearch or implicated in the alleged crimes involving Balco.\n\n   Hill did not involve a seizure, but a challenge to an alleg-\nedly overbroad warrant. In contrast, this case is not about the\noverbreadth of the warrant but rather about whether the mate-\nrials seized and kept and used by the government were within\nthe scope of the warrant. Id. at 977 (“the officers’ wholesale\nseizure was flawed here because they failed to justify it to the\nmagistrate, not because they acted unreasonably or improp-\nerly in executing the warrant”). To the extent Hill is relevant,\nit declined to suppress material that was “described in and\ntherefore taken pursuant to the valid search warrant.” Id.\n(quoting Tamura, 694 F.2d at 597). In contrast, the records\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1175\nsought by the MLBPA here that do not pertain to the ten\nnamed Balco-connected players were not described anywhere\nin the search warrant. Importantly, Hill specifically declined\nto address the question of intermingled files. 459 F.3d at 978\nn.14.\n\n   Neither Adjani nor Hill address the question of intermin-\ngled files. Tamura did, however, and there is no dispute that\nthe government did not follow the post-seizure Tamura proto-\ncol, as the district courts appropriately found. The majority’s\nattempt to paper over this failure by suggesting the search was\nconducted in accordance with the warrant or justified by the\nissuance of subsequent search warrants based on the tainted\nseized information is unavailing.\n\n   In sum, the search did not comply with the warrant terms\nand the post-seizure conduct did not comply with Tamura.\nThus, I must respectfully disagree with the majority’s conclu-\nsion that the CDT search and seizure was conducted in accor-\ndance with the Fourth Amendment and our precedent\ngoverning electronic searches and seizures.\n\n                               5\n\n   For all of these reasons, the district court’s conclusion that\nthe government acted in callous disregard of the rights of the\nplayers is completely supported by the record. The district\ncourts made no error in finding that the first Ramsden factor\nwas satisfied.\n\n                               B\n\n   The second Ramsden factor is whether the movant has an\nindividual interest in and the need for the property he wants\nreturned. I agree with the majority and the district courts that\nthe Players Association satisfied this requirement. At issue are\nthe Fourth Amendment rights of the players. As we know, the\nFourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable\n\f1176     UNITED STATES v.

L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996).11\n  11\n    HIPAA was far from Congress’s first foray into privacy protection. As\nthe United States Department of Heath and Human Services noted:\n       In the 1970s, individual privacy was paramount in the passage of\n       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (1970), the Privacy Act (1974), the\n       Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974), and the Right\n       to Financial Privacy Act (1978). These key laws were followed\n       in the next decade by another series of statutes, including the Pri-\n       vacy Protection Act (1980), the Electronic Communications Pri-\n       vacy Act (1986), the Video Privacy Protection Act (1988), and\n       the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (1988). In the last ten\n       years, Congress and the President have passed additional legal\n       privacy protection through, among others, the Telephone Con-\n       sumer Protection Act (1991), the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act\n       (1994), the Telecommunications Act (1996), the Children’s\n       Online Privacy Protection Act (1998), the Identity Theft and\n\f1178      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nIn the regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA, the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\nemphasized the importance of maintaining the privacy of\nmedical information, concluding that “[p]rivacy is a funda-\nmental right” and that “[a] right to privacy in personal infor-\nmation has historically found expression in American law.”12\n65 Fed.Reg. at 82,464.\n\n   In sum, given controlling legal authority, there is no ques-\ntion that the baseball players who participated in the random\ntesting had a justified expectation of privacy in the test results\nand, in particular, that the test results would not be disclosed.13\n\n    Assumption Deterrence Act (1998), and Title V of the Gramm-\n    Leach-Bliley Act (1999) governing financial privacy.\n       In 1997, a Presidential advisory commission, the Advisory\n    Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health\n    Care Industry, recognized the need for patient privacy protection\n    in its recommendations for a Consumer Bill of Rights and\n    Responsibilities (November 1997). In 1997, Congress enacted the\n    Balanced Budget Act (Public Law 105-34), which added lan-\n    guage to the Social Security Act (18 U.S.C. 1852) to require\n    Medicare+Choice organizations to establish safeguards for the\n    privacy of individually identifiable patient information. Similarly,\n    the Veterans Benefits section of the U.S. Code provides for confi-\n    dentiality of medical records in cases involving drug abuse, alco-\n    holism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle cell anemia (38\n    U.S.C. § 7332).\nStandards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, 65\nFed.Reg. 82,462, 82,469 (Dec. 28, 2000) (codified at former 45 C.F.R. pts.\n160, 164 (2002)).\n   12\n      The Department also emphasized that “While privacy is one of the\nkey values on which our society is built, it is more than an end in itself.\nIt is also necessary for the effective delivery of health care, both to indi-\nviduals and to populations. . . . The need for privacy of health information,\nin particular, has long been recognized as critical to the delivery of needed\nmedical care.” 65 Fed.Reg. at 82,467.\n   13\n      That the athletes had a justified, reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe urine samples themselves that were seized by the government is\nbeyond question. See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112219\"><a href=\"/opinion/112219/skinner-v-railway-labor-executives-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615-617 (1989) (“it is clear that the collection and testing of\nurine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recog-\nnized as reasonable . . . .”).\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1179\n   Of course, under appropriate circumstances, justified pri-\nvacy expectations may be altered by contract. Yin, 95 F.3d at\n872. In this instance, the ballplayers’ privacy expectations\nwere heightened, not diminished, by the collective bargaining\nagreement between the Major League Baseball Players Asso-\nciation and Major League Baseball. The agreement was\nforged after years of impasse concerning steroid testing and,\nas I have discussed, called for anonymous testing to determine\nthe scope of the steroid abuse problem. To that end, the agree-\nment provided, in relevant part that:\n\n    1. During the 2003 season (which shall include\n    spring training but not include the post-season), all\n    Players will be subject to two tests (one initial test\n    and one follow-up test conducted not less than five\n    and not more than seven days following the initial\n    test) at unannounced times for the presence of\n    Schedule III steroids (“Survey Testing”). In addition\n    the Office of Commissioner shall have the right to\n    conduct additional Survey Testing in 2003 in which\n    up to 240 players, selected at random, may be tested.\n\n    2. If the results of the Survey Testing conducted in\n    2003 show that more than 5% of Players tested test\n    positive for Steroids, all Players will be subject to\n    two unannounced tests (an initial test and a followup\n    test five to seven days later) for Steroids during the\n    2004 season (“Program Testing”). If a Player tests\n    positive in the Program Testing, he shall immedi-\n    ately be placed on the Clinical Track and shall be\n    subject to discipline for further violations. The Pro-\n    gram Testing shall continue each season until less\n    than 2.5% of the Players tested test positive for Ste-\n    roids for two consecutive seasons combined.\n\n   In short, the only objective of the 2003 testing was to ascer-\ntain whether the threshold had been exceeded; it was not\nintended to test and monitor individual baseball players.\n\f1180    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nIndeed, the testing protocol was designed to prevent the iden-\ntification of individual players and the matching of players\nwith test results. The record does not reflect whether any indi-\nvidual player was even informed of his testing results for the\n2003 sample year.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement contains numerous\nprovisions assuring confidentiality. For example, the section\nconcerning the testing protocol provides:\n\n       The confidentiality of the Player’s participation in\n    the Program is essential to the Program’s success.\n    Except as provided in Section 8, the Office of the\n    Commissioner, the Association, HPAC, Club per-\n    sonnel, and all of their members, affiliates, agents,\n    consultants and employees are prohibited from pub-\n    licly disclosing information about the Player’s test\n    results, Initial Evaluation, diagnosis, Treatment Pro-\n    gram (including whether a Player is on either the\n    Clinical or Administrative Track), prognosis or com-\n    pliance with the Program.\n\n  The collective bargaining agreement specified in great\ndetail the manner of collection of data and, in particular pro-\nvided that:\n\n    At the conclusion of any Survey Test, and after the\n    results of all tests have been calculated, all test\n    results, including any identifying characteristics, will\n    be destroyed in a process jointly supervised by the\n    Office of the Commissioner and the Association.\n\n   The record contains many more references to the assurance\ngiven Major League Baseball players that the 2003 tests\nwould be anonymous and kept confidential, which are unnec-\nessary to detail. There simply is no doubt whatsoever that the\nplayers had a justified, constitutionally protected privacy\ninterest in the test results — an interest that was further\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1181\nenhanced by the many protections and contractual obligations\ncontained in the collective bargaining agreement under which\nthe tests were conducted.\n\n   In sum, the players had a significant privacy interest in the\nmedical records and physical specimens. There is no doubt\nthat the players have an individual interest in and a need for\nthe property to be returned. Thus, the second Ramsden factor\nis satisfied.\n\n                               C\n\n   I agree with the majority and the district courts that the\nplayers would be irreparably injured by denying the return of\nproperty. As the majority notes, the government has already\nconceded that the players have no adequate remedy at law for\nthe redress of their grievances. Therefore, the third and fourth\nRamsden factors are satisfied.\n\n   For these reasons, I agree with the majority that the district\ncourts properly exercised equitable jurisdiction. However, I\nwould hold that the district courts correctly found that all four\nRamsden factors were satisfied. I disagree with the majority\nthat the government’s actions properly respected the privacy\nrights of the players.\n\n                               V\n\n   We review a district court’s decision to exercise its equita-\nble jurisdiction under Rule 41(g) under the deferential abuse\nof discretion standard. Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 324. I not only fail\nto see any abuse of discretion in the decision by the district\ncourts to exercise equitable jurisdiction, I agree entirely with\ntheir conclusions that the seized property should be returned.\n\n  The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1989 amendments to\nRule 41(g) tell us that “reasonableness under all of the cir-\ncumstances” should be the governing standard for determin-\n\f1182      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ning whether property should be returned. (emphasis added).\nThose same notes state that “[i]f the United States has a need\nfor the property in an investigation or prosecution, its reten-\ntion of the property generally is reasonable,” but that “in cer-\ntain circumstances . . . equitable considerations might justify\nrequiring the government to return or destroy all copies.” Id.14\n\n   Deciding between the two hinges on “whether the Govern-\nment’s conduct was sufficiently reprehensible in this case to\nwarrant this sanction.” Ramsden, 2 F.3d at 327. As the actions\nI have discussed make clear, the government’s behavior was\nsufficiently reprehensible and the privacy interests of the\nplayers who were neither named in the warrant nor implicated\nin any criminal activity are sufficiently important to affirm the\ngranting of the 41(g) motions. Simply put, there is no reason\nfor the government to retain confidential medical information\nand bodily fluids of citizens who are not under any particular-\nized suspicion of criminal activity.\n\n                                    VI\n\n   For similar reasons, I would also affirm Judge Illston’s\ndecision to quash the May 6, 2004, subpoenas. The majority\ncontends that Judge Illston abused her discretion by resting\nher decision to quash the subpoenas on legally insufficient\ngrounds, citing In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Dec. 10,\n1987, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556527\"><a href=\"/opinion/556527/in-re-grand-jury-subpoenas-dated-december-10-1987-does-i-through-iv-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1991), for the proposition that\nsubpoenas and search warrants serve different purposes and\ntherefore arguing that it cannot be considered an abuse to use\nboth methods of obtaining information.

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1183\nthe government’s conduct went beyond seeking warrants and\nsubpoenas for the same information at the same time. As dis-\ncussed previously, the government alternately sought subpoe-\nnas and warrants to obtain highly sensitive information from\nevery Major League Baseball player and to continue to keep\nthat information after being ordered to return it. Further, as\npreviously noted, there were no substantiated risks justifying\nthe use of a warrant to obtain the documentary evidence from\na third party under 28 C.F.R. § 59.1(b).\n\n   In addition, it is worth noting that the May 6 subpoenas\nrequested much of the same information sought in the April\n30 and prior search warrants. The affidavit to obtain the April\n30 search warrant from Judge Lloyd averred that the material\nwas necessary in part because the records may “establish a\nlink to the charged defendants in this case.” It is an abuse of\nthe grand jury process to use grand jury subpoenas to develop\npost-indictment trial material. See, e.g., In Re Grand Jury\nSubpoena Duces Tecum Dated January 2, 1985 (Simels), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454794\"><a href=\"/opinion/454794/in-re-grand-jury-subpoena-duces-tecum-dated-january-2-1985-robert-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (2d Cir. 1985) (timing of subpoena, first issued\nafter indictment, suggested that its purpose was to obtain trial\nmaterial). The Balco indictments were returned in February.\nTherefore, the issuance of the May 6 grand jury subpoena,\nfollowing on the heels of the search warrant application for\nthe same information indicating that its partial purpose was to\ndevelop links to Balco, suggests an abuse of grand jury pro-\ncess.\n\n   Given the history of this case, the district court’s conclu-\nsion that the filing of these subpoenas was “the culmination\nof a series of actions taken by the government in order to pre-\nvent the MLBPA and CDT’s attempt to move to quash the\nJanuary and March subpoenas” is fully supported by the\nrecord and certainly cannot be said to be an abuse of discre-\ntion.\n\n                              VII\n\n  Although I have detailed why I believe the findings and\nconclusions of the district court should be sustained on\n\f1184      UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nappeal, I cannot leave the matter at hand without discussing\nthe larger implications of this case.\n\n                                    A\n\n   The principle at stake in this case is relevant in countless\nmodern scenarios in which data responsive to a warrant is\nintermingled with private, unresponsive data. The result of the\nmajority’s holding is that the government has been permitted\nto seize confidential medical information pertaining to indi-\nviduals not under any criminal suspicion. The majority’s\nholding that the government was entitled to seize all records\nin computerized files and subsequently search the records\nwithout probable cause puts Americans’ most basic privacy\ninterests in jeopardy. Approving of the tactics employed here\nwould entitle the government to seize the medical records of\nanyone who had the misfortune of visiting a hospital or\nbelonging to a health care provider that kept patient records\nin any sort of master file which also contained the data of a\nperson whose information was subject to a search warrant. I\nagree entirely with Judge Illston’s observation that the impli-\ncations of approving such behavior are staggering. Under the\nmajority’s holding, no laboratory or hospital or health care\nfacility could guarantee the confidentiality of records.15\n   15\n      This is why, even when large sets of data need to be sorted to find\nmaterial responsive to a warrant, that task is assigned to a computer spe-\ncialist and not the agents tasked with conducting the investigation. The\nmajority fails to see the relevance of this role division, but it is evident\nhere. Had a computer specialist sorted the data as prescribed by the war-\nrant, it is unlikely he or she would have extracted non-responsive records\nand then used them to apply for further warrants seeking access to test\nresults beyond the scope of the initial investigation. Instead, Agent\nNovitzsky, who was tasked with leading the investigation, viewed material\nhe was not supposed to see and used it for purposes for which the warrant\nwas never initially intended. If the warrant had intended to authorize any\nagent to examine the intermingled data, it would not have gone out of its\nway to specify that only certain agents were permitted to engage in that\ntask.\n\f            UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING                  1185\n  The majority attempts to discount this possibility, but offers\nno principled reason why it does not apply in hundreds of\nother contexts. Indeed, under questioning from the district\njudges, the government itself did not discount the possibility\nof other widespread searches.16\n  16\n     For example, a hearing before Magistrate Judge Johnson contained the\nfollowing colloquy between government counsel and the Court:\n       Court:     * * * If there is some other drug testing lab apart\n                  from CDT, would you ever use — but the test for the\n                  ten were at CDT. Would you ever use this informa-\n                  tion to go and say — just demand that you can get the\n                  drug testing results from other labs that test profes-\n                  sional athletes. . . . Based on the theory that it’s sys-\n                  temic. And so there’s a problem, there’s a problem.\n                  And we know that these other labs test athletes, too.\n                  So can you just go search?\n       Counsel:   Yes, your honor.\n   Similarly, in another hearing Judge Illston asked government counsel\nwhether he thought it was possible to take the information from the Tracey\ndirectory concerning other sports organizations and use individual test\nresults of athletes to launch another investigation. Strikingly, Judge Illston\nposed it as a hypothetical, but the government did not appear to deny that\nofficers may have viewed individual records in other sports:\n       Court:     What if hockey had a subdirectory that had positive\n                  results and he clicked on it to make sure it was what\n                  it said it was, by George, that’s what it was, what\n                  about that?\n       Counsel:   I don’t know in checking to make sure it was hockey\n                  that didn’t happen. If it did happen, I would think that\n                  theoretically Agent Novitsky would have the right to\n                  either request a search warrant or, I suppose, if you\n                  looked at it enough, it’s possible that it was obvious,\n                  it was plain view, it was other drug use by hockey\n                  players. So there might be a legal entitlement for\n                  Agent Novitzsky to use that and do something with\n                  it. It hasn’t happened in this case. I suppose that’s\n                  theoretically possible, again, you would have, I\n                  believe, probable cause to believe that evidence in\n                  there would lead to other persons potentially involved\n                  in disputable criminal drugs, which is the crime that’s\n                  under investigation.\n\f1186    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n   The importance of this threat to our nation’s medical com-\nmunity cannot be overstated. In order to provide better and\nmore efficient heath care, doctors and hospitals have rapidly\nembraced a variety of methods for sharing confidential patient\ninformation electronically. Computerized physician order\nentry, for example, allows doctors to transmit treatment\ninstructions widely throughout a health care computer net-\nwork so that nurses, therapists, pharmacists, radiologists and\npathologists have instant and accurate access to the instruc-\ntions. Computerized electronic record transmission decreases\ndelay, reduces costs, and minimizes errors. But it does involve\nextensive electronic co-mingling of patient data throughout\ncomputer networks.\n\n   Likewise, mass electronic transmission and storage of con-\nfidential medical records is now ingrained in the health insur-\nance industry. Electronic access allows more efficient and\ntimely determination and payment of medical insurance bene-\nfits.\n\n   The federal government has taken an affirmative role in\npromoting national patient data access. In 2004, for example,\nthe President created the Office of National Coordinator for\nHealth Information Technology in order to develop and\nimplement a nationwide infrastructure to allow the communi-\ncation and exchange of health care data between different\ninformation technology systems.

To endorse the gov-\nernment’s position that probable cause as to one patient’s\nrecords justifies the seizure of all co-mingled records would\nmean that the Fourth Amendment does not afford any mean-\ningful protection at all for our citizens’ most private informa-\ntion.\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING          1187\n                                B\n\n   As the Players Association and Amicus Chamber of Com-\nmerce have effectively argued, today’s decision will also sig-\nnificantly impair the ability of employers to promote\nvoluntary drug testing in the workplace. Employers are not\npermitted unilaterally to impose workplace drug testing on\nemployees subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\nUnited Foods & Commercial Workers v. Foster Poultry\nFarms, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (9th Cir. 1995) (“there is no indica-\ntion in the relevant statutes, the legislative history, or the reg-\nulations themselves that the drug testing requirements were\nintended to preempt already existing collective bargaining\nagreements or to eliminate an employer’s duty to bargain\nunder federal labor laws.”). If the government may violate the\nconfidentiality promised employees in collective bargaining\nagreements without any suspicion of criminal activity and\nsimply seize confidential test records in the hope of finding\nincriminating information, no sensible union will agree to\nallow its employees to be tested. Therefore, although the gov-\nernment proceeds here under an apparent mission to root out\nall steroid use in baseball, and perhaps other sports, the result\nof its tactics will be quite the opposite. Without mandatory\ntesting, any steroid policy will be but an empty aspirational\ngoal. If today’s decision stands, it is difficult to imagine any\nsports union agreeing to drug testing in collective bargaining\nnegotiations. The implications for employee testing in all\nindustries are obvious.\n\n                                C\n\n   Finally, today’s decision marks the return of the prohibited\ngeneral warrant through an endorsement of a disguised imper-\nmissible general search warrant—a tactic we rejected in\nUnited States v. Rettig, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1978). Indeed,\nas the Supreme Court has observed, “[i]t is familiar history\nthat indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the\nauthority of ‘general warrants’ were the immediate evils that\n\f1188    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nmotivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amend-\nment.” Payton v.

It was\nfor this reason that the particularity requirement in warrants\nwas adopted. As the Court noted in Maryland v. Garrison,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111823\"><a href=\"/opinion/111823/maryland-v-garrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1987):\n\n    The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment cate-\n    gorically prohibits the issuance of any warrant\n    except one “particularly describing the place to be\n    searched and the persons or things to be seized.” The\n    manifest purpose of this particularity requirement\n    was to prevent general searches. By limiting the\n    authorization to search to the specific areas and\n    things for which there is probable cause to search,\n    the requirement ensures that the search will be care-\n    fully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on\n    the character of the wide-ranging exploratory\n    searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\n\n  The majority allows the government to circumvent these\nimportant Fourth Amendment principles by allowing the gov-\nernment to use boilerplate computer search language in a war-\nrant to justify the seizure and subsequent warrantless search\nof massive amounts of data not responsive to the warrant. In\ndoing so, the majority has allowed the government with the\nwave of a computer curser to transform a limited search war-\nrant into an impermissible general warrant.\n\n                              VIII\n\n   I also cannot leave our consideration of this case without\naddressing the actual argument made by the government in\njustifying its actions. The government did not advocate the\nposition adopted by the majority. The government’s sole justi-\nfication for the warrantless seizure of the data of the unlisted\nplayers is that it was in “plain view,” which is one of the lim-\nited exceptions to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant require-\nment. Although the majority did not reach this question, the\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING        1189\ntheory formed the entire basis for the government’s legal jus-\ntification for its actions and was the primary focus of the pro-\nceedings before the district courts. Therefore, it is important\nto address it to demonstrate the soundness of the various deci-\nsions by the district courts.\n\n   The plain view doctrine is based on the assumption that if\nthere is probable cause for the search, and the officer is\nlegally entitled to be at the premises under the Fourth Amend-\nment, seizure of an object in plain view that is contraband or\nevidence of a crime does not involve an invasion of privacy.\nPayton, 445 U.S. at 586-87. The Supreme Court has identified\nseveral conditions that must be satisfied before a plain view\nseizure of an object is upheld: (1) the officer conducting the\nseizure must lawfully arrive at the position from which the\nobject is plainly seen; (2) the object must be in plain view; (3)\nthe object’s incriminating character must be “immediately\napparent,” that is, the officer must have probable cause to\nbelieve the object is contraband or evidence of a crime; and\n(4) the officer must have a lawful right of access to the object\nitself.

After an extensive colloquy, Judge Illston con-\ncluded that the computer data seized was not in “plain view.”\n\f1190    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nNot only is this factual conclusion not clearly erroneous, the\nundisputed record completely supports her conclusion under\nany standard of review.\n\n   As Judge Illston pointed out, this was not a case in which\nan incriminating photo or similar evidence could be viewed\non a computer screen; rather, at best, it involved scrolling\nthrough thousands of records none of which were immedi-\nately visible. In its application for a search warrant, the gov-\nernment justified removal of data and computer equipment on\nthe basis that:\n\n    The volume of data stored on many computer sys-\n    tems and storage devices will typically be so large\n    that it will be highly impractical to search for data\n    during the execution of the physical search of the\n    premises. A single megabyte of storage space is the\n    equivalent of 500 double-spaced pages of text. A\n    single gigabyte of storage space, or 1,000\n    megabytes, is the equivalent of 500,000 double-\n    spaced pages of text. Storage devices capable of\n    storing fifteen gigabytes of data are now common-\n    place in desktop computers. Consequently, each non-\n    networked desktop computer found during a search\n    can easily contain the equivalent of 7.5 million pages\n    of data, which, if printed out, would completely fill\n    a 10’ x 12’ x 10’ room to the ceiling.\n\n  The government also indicated in its affidavit that it would\nbe using consulting computer specialists to analyze the data.\nThe affidavit explained:\n\n    Searching computer systems is highly technical pro-\n    cess which requires specific expertise and special-\n    ized equipment. There are so many types of\n    computer hardware and software in use today that it\n    is impractical to bring to the search site all of the\n    necessary technical manuals and specialized equip-\n\f        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1191\n    ment to conduct a thorough search. In addition, it\n    may also be necessary to consult with computer per-\n    sonnel who have specific expertise in the type of\n    computer software application or operating system\n    that is being searched.\n\n   According to the government, the search of the computers\nat CDT could not be completed at the scene. There were, in\nfact, 16 computers. However, one computer was eventually\nisolated and data retrieved. As Special Agent Novitsky’s\nmemorandum of activity stated:\n\n    At approximately 2:35 p.m., S/A Abboud began\n    working on a computer with [a CDT employee].\n    [She] directed us to a computer in the office labeled\n    “E” for purposes of the search warrant and sketch.\n    At this computer, [she] identified a sub-directory\n    entitled “Tracey”, which she said contained all of the\n    computer documents for CDT’s sports drug testing\n    division. A cursory review of the subdirectory indi-\n    cated multiple further subdirectories and several\n    hundred computer files. As authorized by the war-\n    rant, because of the length of time it would take to\n    search each file and the intrusiveness it would cause\n    on CDT, it was decided to make a complete copy of\n    the “Tracey” subdirectory in order to perform a\n    search of it in the IRS-CID offices at a later time.\n\n   Agent Novitsky later explained in a subsequent affidavit\nthat:\n\n    This subdirectory contained hundreds of files and a\n    significant amount of computer data. After consult-\n    ing with agents at the scene specifically trained in\n    the search of computers, we determined that we\n    could not realistically search the entire directory on-\n    site in a reasonable amount of time. We therefore\n\f1192    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\n    made the determination to copy the entire sub-\n    directory.\n\n   After it was examined, the Tracey directory itself was\ndetermined to contain 2,911 files, with an unknown amount\nof data in each file, that were not connected with Major\nLeague Baseball player drug testing at all. In the files that\nconcerned Major League Baseball players, there was informa-\ntion on approximately 1,200 players, with multiple test\nresults.\n\n   Given these circumstances, the data seized cannot be con-\nsidered to be in “plain view.” As the Supreme Court has\nnoted, “If, however, the police lack probable cause to believe\nthat an object in plain view is contraband without conducting\nsome further search of the object — i.e., if its incriminating\ncharacter is not immediately apparent, the plain view doctrine\ncannot justify its seizure.” Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 375 (alter-\nations and quotations omitted). The data now sought by the\ngovernment was not “obvious to the senses” at the scene, nor\nwere the positive tests in “plain view” from a glance at a com-\nputer screen. The data required analysis and thorough exami-\nnation off-site before the data at issue was discovered.\n\n   The “plain view” doctrine is inapplicable in the general\nelectronic context because it is at complete odds with the\nunderlying theory of the doctrine. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained:\n\n    The theory of that doctrine consists of extending to\n    nonpublic places such as the home, where searches\n    and seizures without a warrant are presumptively\n    unreasonable, the police’s longstanding authority to\n    make warrantless seizures in public places of such\n    objects as weapons and contraband. And the practi-\n    cal justification for that extension is the desirability\n    of sparing police, whose viewing of the object in the\n    course of a lawful search is as legitimate as it would\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING         1193\n    have been in a public place, the inconvenience and\n    risk—to themselves or to preservation of the\n    evidence—of going to obtain a warrant.\n\nHorton, 480 U.S. at 326-27 (internal citations omitted).\n\n   Neither of those considerations is present when we consider\nthe off-site examination of electronic data. As the government\nessentially acknowledged in its search warrant applications,\nexamination of computer data is a forensic exercise. It neces-\nsarily involves the application of software to interpret the\ndata; without external software aid, the data would appear\nonly as binary numbers. In addition, as in this case, the gov-\nernment often requires computer specialists to decipher the\ndata. Electronic data is simply not the kind of evidence that\nforms a natural extension of an officer’s discovery of obvious\ncontraband in a public place. The fact that further careful\nelectronic assistance is required outside the searched premises\nto interpret the data belies the “practical” justification that\nthere is insufficient time to obtain a warrant. Indeed, electron-\nically assisted searches of binary numbers bear a closer\nresemblance to the thermal imaging searches of homes that\nthe Supreme Court rejected as violative of the Fourth Amend-\nment in Kyllo v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118443\"><a href=\"/opinion/118443/kyllo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).\n\n  The ultimate fact that, after the assistance of electronic soft-\nware programs, the data may be observed “in plain view”\ndoes not alter this conclusion. As the Supreme Court has\nwarned:\n\n    [I]n the vast majority of cases, any evidence seized\n    by the police will be in plain view, at least at the\n    moment of seizure. The problem with the “plain\n    view” doctrine has been to identify the circum-\n    stances in which plain view has legal significance\n    rather than being simply the normal concomitant of\n    any search, legal or illegal.\n\f1194    UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\nCoolidge, 403 U.S. at 465.\n\n   The off-site forensic examination of computer data is sim-\nply not one of those circumstances that fits the “plain view”\nparadigm. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to write out the\nFourth Amendment’s particularity requirement with respect to\nelectronic data and to transform particularized search warrants\ninto general search warrants, with the government authorized\nto conduct indiscriminate, dragnet searches.\n\n                               B\n\n   The government also failed to sustain its burden to estab-\nlish the plain view exception because, as the district courts\nfound, the incriminating character of the information was not\n“immediately apparent.” It was clear under the testing proto-\ncol that positive tests did not necessarily reflect steroid use;\nthe use of nutritional supplements—which is common in pro-\nfessional sports—could yield a false positive. In addition,\nthere are a whole host of legitimate reasons for individuals to\nbe prescribed steroid products. The CDT testing was not\nundertaken to test individual players; but rather to provide a\nsurvey for the possible establishment of an individual drug\ntesting protocol.\n\n   The government relied on sheer speculation that the pres-\nence of positive steroid markers would mean that the athlete\nhad received steroids without prescription from some\nunknown person. The crime that the government was inter-\nested in pursuing was the illegal distribution of steroids. The\nevidence of a positive test was not affirmative evidence of any\ndistribution. The government’s theory was that, armed with\nthe test results, the government could then summon the athlete\nbefore a grand jury to see if it could obtain evidence from\nwhom and under what circumstances the athlete may have\nobtained steroids.\n\n   However, the mere suspicion of criminal activity or the sus-\npicion of knowledge of a criminal activity is not sufficient to\n\f         UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING           1195\nsustain a seizure of evidence under the plain view doctrine.\nAs the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear, the “imme-\ndiately apparent” requirement means that the law enforcement\nofficer must have probable cause to seize the property that the\nofficer observed in plain view. As the Court explained:\n\n    We now hold that probable cause is required. To say\n    otherwise would be to cut the “plain view” doctrine\n    loose from its theoretical and practical moorings. . . .\n    Dispensing with the need for a warrant is worlds\n    apart from permitting a lesser standard of cause for\n    the seizure than a warrant would require, i.e., the\n    standard of probable cause. No reason is apparent\n    why an object should routinely be seizable on lesser\n    grounds, during an unrelated search and seizure, than\n    would have been needed to obtain a warrant for that\n    same object if it had been known to be on the prem-\n    ises.\n\nArizona v. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111834\"><a href=\"/opinion/111834/arizona-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326-27 (1987).\n\n   The government conceded that it did not have probable\ncause to search or seize any data or specimens beyond what\nwas relevant to the ten players listed in the warrant. For those\nplayers, the government provided extensive information\nshowing their alleged connection to Balco. However, the gov-\nernment conceded that it had no information connecting any\nof the other players to Balco. Indeed, it made that clear in\nboth its affidavits and subsequent hearings. The affidavit pro-\nvided to Judge Lloyd speculated that evidence might be\ndeveloped linking the players who tested positive to Balco\n“because of the closely-knit professional baseball communi-\nty,” but also speculated that the positive test results could sug-\ngest “another significant source of illegal performance-\nenhancing drugs.” In fact, the government tendered no evi-\ndence whatsoever in support of either theory. The government\ndid not have any information concerning who might be\n\f1196        UNITED STATES v. COMPREHENSIVE DRUG TESTING\ninvolved in any distribution scheme; in fact, it had no idea at\nall.17\n\n   The government did not submit any evidence contradicting\nthe affidavits indicating the possibility of false positives and\nthat a positive result did not necessarily indicate illegal steroid\nuse. There was no specific target of the investigation against\nwhom the government sought incriminating evidence.\n\n   Mere speculation is not sufficient to establish probable\ncause. United States v.

Perhaps the government had reasonable suspicion, but\nthat is not sufficient to justify a seizure under the plain view\ndoctrine. See Hicks, 480 U.S. at 326 (holding that “probable\ncause is required”); Payton, 445 U.S. at 587 (explaining the\nplain view requirement that there be “probable cause to asso-\nciate the property with criminal activity.”).\n\n  The government’s plain view theory cannot justify its\nactions in this case.\n\n                                     IX\n\n   I concur in the majority’s conclusion that the media has\nstanding on appeal to file a motion to unseal records.

For example, the\ntranscript of one of the hearings before one of the district\ncourt judges reflects the following colloquy:\n\n       Court:    Why is that, that you are locking the door?\n\n       Clerk:    Since the case was filed under seal.\n\n       Court:    Is this all under seal? * * * You want the\n                 hearings under seal. There was no motion\n                 made to seal the hearing. I wasn’t aware\n                 you wanted it that way.\n\n       Counsel: Your honor, we filed the pleadings under\n                seal. We think this proceeding should be\n                under seal. The information at issue is\n                highly confidential.\n\n   After some colloquy, the court allowed the courtroom to be\nsealed, but admonished counsel to file an appropriate motion\nif they wished any further courtroom proceedings to be closed\nin the future. However, neither the public nor the press were\nnotified that the doors were to be locked and the public\nbarred.\n\n  “Under the first amendment, the press and the public have\na presumed right of access to court proceedings and docu-\n  18\n    The government and the Players Association also sought to have oral\nargument in the court of appeals closed to the public.

None of these procedural\nsteps were undertaken in the district courts.\n\n   To be sure, the right of access to court proceedings is not\nabsolute. Id. at 946. Both parties have legitimate privacy\ninterests to protect.

However, there are non-grand jury\nmaterials involved in this case, and there are some proceed-\nings that do not appear to have involved confidential material.20\n\n   In any case, these are matters best considered in the first\ninstance by the district court, with public notice so that the\nFirst Amendment right of access may be balanced with the\nprivacy interests of the parties. Unfortunately, the parties\npresented hearing closure and record sealing as a fait accom-\npli to the district courts, without notice to the press or public.\nNow that we have remanded the motion to unseal, this issue\nmay be addressed.\n\n                                    X\n\n   In discussions of the use of alleged use of steroids by base-\nball players, much is made about “the integrity of the game.”\nEven more important is the integrity of our legal system. Per-\nhaps baseball has become consumed by a “Game of Shadows,”21\nbut that is no reason for the government to engage in a “Pros-\necution of Shadows.” The district judges were entirely right\nto order the government to return the thousands of private\nmedical records it wrongfully seized by use of pretext and\nartifice.\n\n   I would affirm the orders of the district court and must\n  20\n      The government, in at least one proceeding, seemed to indicate that\nit might not oppose unsealing some material, with government counsel\nstating before Judge Mahan: “As a matter of DOJ regulation and policy,\nwe actually have taken the position and we do take the position that there\nisn’t a need to have these proceedings actually sealed, and that is because\nof the paramount interest in having actual public proceedings in court-\nrooms held in public.” However, the government did not object formally\nto sealing the transcript of that hearing, and the transcript has, to date,\nbeen sealed.\n   21\n      Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, Game of Shadows (2006).\n\f1200    UNITED STATES v.
