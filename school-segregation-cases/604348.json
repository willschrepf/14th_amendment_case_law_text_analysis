Michael  Kevin DuPont appeals from the\r                                \r\n\ndistrict  court's denial  of preliminary  injunctive relief.1\r                                                                        1\r\n\nWe affirm,  without prejudice  to his  right to  seek certain\r\n\nrelief anew in the district court, as is explained below.  \r\n\n          A.  Background\r                                    \r\n\n          DuPont  is incarcerated  at  MCI-Cedar Junction  in\r\n\nMassachusetts.    In 1992,  he filed  a  pro se  civil rights\r                                                           \r\n\naction  against various  Department of  Corrections personnel\r\n\nand others,  seeking damages  and injunctive relief  under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.     1983.    Among  other   things,  he  alleged  that\r\n\ndefendants had  violated his rights by  using excessive force\r\n\nagainst him, seizing his legal materials, denying him medical\r\n\ncare, and threatening to confine him in a disciplinary  unit.\r\n\nAt  the  time  he filed  his  complaint,  DuPont  was in  the\r\n\nDepartmental Segregation Unit (DSU),  but he was later placed\r\n\nin  the  Departmental  Disciplinary  Unit  (DDU),   where  he\r\n\nremains.  \r\n\n          In  this  appeal,  DuPont challenges  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  denial of  his  request for  an injunction  ordering\r\n\ncompliance  with certain stipulations,  agreements, or orders\r\n\nin  the following cases:   Cepulonis v. Fair,  D. Mass.,  No.\r                                                        \r\n\n78-3233-Z; Stone v. Boone, D. Mass., No. 73-1083-T; Alston v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The court  accepted  a magistrate's  report  recommending\r               1\r\ndenial of some of his  requests for relief in an order  dated\r\nAugust 3,  1995, and summarily  denied other  requests in  an\r\norder  dated March 13, 1996.   DuPont appeals  from those two\r\norders.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nFair, D. Mass., No. 77-3519-G; Hoffer v. Fair, S.J.C. No. 85-\r                                                         \r\n\n71; and DuPont v. Hall,  Norfolk Super. Ct. No. 87-1399.   He\r                                  \r\n\nalso  objects  to the  court's  denial  of his  requests  for\r\n\ninjunctions  forbidding  the   use  of  chemical   agents  or\r\n\nexcessive force  against him,  forbidding his placement  in a\r\n\nstrip cell, directing the return of postage stamps taken from\r\n\nhis incoming mail  and the return of certain legal materials,\r\n\nand directing his release from the DDU.\r\n\n          B.  Discussion\r                                    \r\n\n          If the district  court has made  no clear error  of\r\n\nlaw or fact in its ruling on a preliminary injunction motion,\r\n\nwe will not  disturb its conclusion absent  manifest abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.  See Cohen v. Brown University, 991 F.2d 888, 902\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).   For  the reasons outlined  below, we  find\r\n\nthat the  district  court  did  not overstep  its  bounds  in\r\n\ndenying the requested relief.\r\n\n          Consent Decree  Violations.  In  part, DuPont seeks\r                                                \r\n\norders enforcing federal or  state court consent decrees, but\r\n\nsuch relief is unavailable  in an individual action  under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983.   See Martel v.  Fridovich, 14 F.3d  1, 3 n.4\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).2\r                            2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2On appeal, DuPont presents a new claim that his placement\r               2\r\nin the DDU breached a settlement agreement in DuPont v. Fair,\r                                                                        \r\nPlymouth  Super. Ct. No. 89-0105-B, but that claim would also\r\nbe barred under Martel.\r                                  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          State Law Violations.  DuPont also asserts  various\r                                          \r\n\nstate law violations, e.g., that defendants have not properly\r\n\npromulgated certain  DDU rules, did not  medically screen him\r\n\nbefore  placing him in the DDU, and have not provided certain\r\n\nlaw library  access, all  in violation  of state  statutes or\r\n\nregulations.  But he does not explain how  defendants thereby\r\n\nviolated  federal law, and this court does not have the power\r\n\nto  direct state  officials to  comply with  state law.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nQuintero de  Quintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 230 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1992)  (citing  Pennhurst   State  Sch.  and  Hosp.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106 (1984)).\r                     \r\n\n          Court  Access.   DuPont  complains that  defendants\r                                   \r\n\nviolated his right to court access by restricting his ability\r\n\nto  conduct legal  research3 and  by seizing  legal materials\r                                       3\r\n\nfrom his cell.  DuPont has clearly been able to challenge his\r\n\ncriminal conviction  and sentence  by filing a  direct appeal\r\n\nand post-conviction motions in state court and  by filing two\r\n\nhabeas petitions (and appeals  from the dismissal thereof) in\r\n\nfederal  court.  He has also been  able to file and prosecute\r\n\nthis action  challenging the  conditions of  his confinement.\r\n\nNothing in the  record indicates that DuPont's  access to the\r\n\ncourts has not been adequate or meaningful.  Consequently, he\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3According  to  DuPont,  he  may not  physically  use  the\r               3\r\nprison's law libraries, but  must submit written requests for\r\nxeroxed copies  of legal  materials and give  exact citations\r\nfor such materials, and he has no access to softcover advance\r\nsheets.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nhas  not  suffered the  \"actual  injury\" required  to  show a\r\n\nviolation of his right to meaningful court access.  See Lewis\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Casey, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 2180-82 (1996).\r                    \r\n\n          Liberty Interests.  DuPont asserts that  defendants\r                                       \r\n\nhave violated his due process liberty interest in law library\r\n\naccess and in not being confined in  the DDU by their failure\r\n\nto  comply with obligations imposed in the cases cited in the\r\n\nbeginning  of  this opinion.    Contrary  to DuPont's  claim,\r\n\nhowever,  the  Alston  case  did not  require  defendants  to\r                                 \r\n\nprepare and  evaluate a  health status report  before placing\r\n\nhim in  the DDU, which is located at Cedar Junction as is the\r\n\nDSU  where he  was previously  housed.   Alston requires  the\r                                                           \r\n\npreparation and  review of health status  reports only before\r\n\nan   inmate  is   transferred   to   an  entirely   different\r\n\ninstitution.   Likewise, Stone does not  clearly grant DuPont\r                                          \r\n\nthe  right  to physically  use the  prison  law library.   It\r\n\nrequires that all inmates have  supervised access to the  law\r\n\nlibrary  unless  \"special  circumstances\" dictate  otherwise.\r\n\nSuch circumstances may well encompass DuPont's confinement in\r\n\nthe DDU.  \r\n\n          DuPont v.  Fair and the Hoffer  and Cepulonis cases\r                                                                   \r\n\nrelate  only to inmates in  the DSU, but  DuPont alleges that\r                                               \r\n\nthey  apply  because the  DDU  is  really a  pretextual  DSU.\r\n\nDuPont's arguments  on this point  are not  persuasive.   The\r\n\naffidavit by  defendant DOC  Commissioner Dubois to  which he\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\npoints affirmed that the DDU is distinct from the  DSU in its\r                                           \r\n\ndisciplinary purpose.   The  list of comparisons  between the\r\n\nDSU  and DDU  which DuPont  submitted to  the district  court\r\n\nactually  describes significant  differences between  the two\r\n\nunits.  Finally, while the  DDU may have effectively replaced\r\n\nthe DSU at Cedar Junction, Commissioner Dubois testified in a\r\n\ndeposition in a different case (which is in the record before\r\n\nus) that he did not establish the DDU in order to evade legal\r\n\nobligations applicable to the DSU.  \r\n\n          In  his  objections  to  the  magistrate's  report,\r\n\nDuPont raised an argument  based on Sandin v. Conner,  115 S.\r                                                                \r\n\nCt.  2293 (1995), which had just then been decided, and which\r\n\nthe district  court did not discuss in  its opinion accepting\r\n\nthe  report   and  recommendation.     DuPont   asserts  that\r\n\nconfinement  in  the  DDU  is  an  atypical  and  significant\r\n\ndeprivation, giving him a  due process liberty interest under\r\n\nSandin,  which defendants violated  when they put  him in the\r                  \r\n\nDDU.    The  present   record  does  not  contain  sufficient\r\n\ninformation to permit  evaluation of this  claim.4  For  that\r                                                             4\r\n\nreason, a remand to consider the Sandin claim makes no sense.\r                                                   \r\n\nAccordingly,  we affirm the denials below on the basis of the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   4We  note, too, that DuPont  has asked us  to send certain\r               4\r\nmaterials on file  in this  court which are  relevant to  his\r\nSandin claim to the district court, a request which we hereby\r                  \r\ngrant.    The  materials  were  filed  in  connection with  a\r\nprevious  appeal by DuPont in this case, but were never filed\r\nin the district court.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\narguments originally presented to  the district court, but do\r\n\nso without  prejudice to  DuPont's right to  seek preliminary\r\n\ninjunctive  relief anew  based  on Sandin.    We remind  him,\r                                                     \r\n\nhowever, that  the district court has directed  him to comply\r\n\nfully  with Loc.  R.  7.1 in  filing  motions and  supporting\r\n\nmemoranda  in  that  court,  and that  district  courts  \"are\r\n\nentitled to  demand adherence to specific  mandates contained\r\n\nin  the [local]  rules.\"    See  Air  Line  Pilots  Ass'n  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPrecision Valley Aviation, Inc.,  26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1994).\r\n\n          Equal Protection.   On appeal,  DuPont asserts that\r                                      \r\n\nthe particular law library  access restrictions placed on him\r\n\nas a  DDU inmate violate his equal  protection rights because\r\n\nother inmates in \"disciplinary segregation,\" i.e., inmates in\r\n\nthe  \"locked down max end  and segregation blocks  9 and 10,\"\r\n\nhave  greater library access.   This bare allegation does not\r\n\nestablish  that  the  inmates   he  refers  to  are  situated\r\n\nsimilarly  enough  to  DDU  inmates to  require  similar  law\r\n\nlibrary rights.  See  Hosna v.

On  three\r                                                           \r\n\noccasions  in 1994, defendants put DuPont in a strip cell for\r\n\nperiods ranging from  four to eleven days,  during which time\r\n\nDuPont's incoming mail was allegedly withheld and he was also\r\n\ndenied  writing materials.   We  evaluate the  withholding of\r\n\nincoming mail under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987),\r                                                \r\n\nsee Thornburgh v. Abbott,  490 U.S. 401, 413 (1989),  and the\r                                    \r\n\nrestriction  on outgoing  mail (i.e.,  the denial  of writing\r\n\nmaterials) under Procunier v.  Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974).\r                                                   \r\n\nBecause  the withholding  of mail  was reasonably  related to\r\n\nlegitimate  penological  interests  and  the  restriction  on\r\n\noutgoing mail  furthered a substantial  governmental interest\r\n\nunrelated to the suppression of expression and was no greater\r\n\nthan necessary, we find  no constitutional violation.  DuPont\r\n\nwas placed in a strip cell due to  intransigence sufficiently\r\n\nserious  to require the use  of chemical agents.  Restricting\r\n\nhis  mail  privileges helped  the  state  maintain order  and\r\n\nsecurity in the DDU  by ensuring that unpleasant consequences\r\n\nflowed from such misbehavior.   See, e.g., Little  v. Norris,\r                                                                        \r\n\n787 F.2d  1241,  1243-44 (8th  Cir.  1986) (\"The  purpose  of\r\n\nwithholding  personal  mail  is to  make  punitive  isolation\r\n\nunpleasant,  and thereby  discourage  improper  behavior  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nhis equal  protection rights.   As noted above,  DuPont's own\r\nlist  comparing  the  DSU and  DDU  suggests  that there  are\r\nsignificant differences between the two units.  Since DSU and\r\nDDU inmates do not  seem to be similarly situated,  his claim\r\nseems unlikely to be successful.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\npromote  security within  the prison.\").   Given  the limited\r\n\nprivileges of  DDU inmates, which must  be earned, defendants\r\n\nmay have had few other alternatives for inducing persistently\r\n\ndisobedient  inmates like  DuPont to  behave.   Moreover, the\r\n\nwithdrawal  of mail  privileges  was temporary.   DuPont  was\r\n\ngiven  his mail and permitted to  write letters after leaving\r\n\nthe strip cell.  His confinement was also relatively short in\r\n\nduration, lasting  11  days or  less.   The  restriction  was\r\n\ncontent  neutral,  applying  to  all  incoming  and  outgoing\r\n\ncorrespondence.  DuPont was permitted attorney visits and his\r\n\nattorney could keep him informed about pending cases.  He has\r\n\nnot asserted  the actual loss  of any cause of  action due to\r                                         \r\n\nhis inability to write letters or draft legal documents while\r\n\nconfined in the strip cell.\r\n\n          Incoming  Stamps.   Defendants have  removed stamps\r                                      \r\n\nfrom DuPont's  incoming mail,  citing a DDU  rule prohibiting\r\n\nthe receipt  of  stamps through  the mail  and requiring  DDU\r\n\ninmates  to buy stamps at  the prison canteen.   DuPont avers\r\n\nthat he did not  have enough money in  his prison account  to\r\n\nbuy  stamps.  But his  correspondents who desire  to send him\r\n\nstamps  may  donate funds  to  his  prison account  for  that\r\n\npurpose, instead.   See 103 Code  Mass. Regs.   405.16.   The\r                                   \r\n\nprison also provides some free  postage for personal mail and\r\n\nunlimited postage  for necessary mail to  court officials and\r\n\nattorneys.

The prison's\r\n\nproperty limit regulation expressly  permitted him to keep no\r\n\nmore than 1 cubic  foot of legal  materials in his cell,  see\r                                                                         \r\n\n103 Code Mass. Regs.   403.09, and so defendants could remove\r\n\nmaterials exceeding  that limit.  The  regulation in question\r\n\nis not  arbitrary or unreasonable simply  because the federal\r\n\nprison  system has a more generous property limit.  See Savko\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Rollins, 749 F.  Supp. 1403, 1407-8 (D.

DuPont   seeks  an   injunction\r                                     \r\n\nagainst  defendants'  use of  chemical  agents when  removing\r\n\nexcess legal materials from his cell, alleging that they have\r\n\nused  excessive  force and  chemical  agents  against him  on\r\n\nmultiple  occasions from 1991 to  1994.  The record indicates\r\n\nthat chemical agents and/or forced move teams  have been used\r\n\nagainst DuPont some 14 times in that time period after he has\r\n\nrefused to obey orders or rules.  He may be  able to convince\r\n\na  jury that excessive force was used against him on February\r\n\n14,  1994, as he asserts,  but that injury  could be remedied\r\n\nthrough a damages award.   See Cohen, supra, 991 F.2d  at 902\r                                                       \r\n\n(the  availability of  adequate damages  may justify  denying\r\n\npreliminary  injunctive  relief).  On practically  all  other\r\n\noccasions when chemical agents  were used against him, DuPont\r\n\nreported no injuries and medical personnel observed none.  On\r\n\na few occasions, he  reported old or minor injuries.   Prison\r\n\nofficials  sought medical authorization before using chemical\r\n\nagents  on DuPont  and his  eyes and  face were  washed after\r\n\ntheir use.  We conclude,  therefore, that defendants have not\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   6DuPont also  sought  the return  of particular  materials\r               6\r\nremoved from his cell in July 1994.

DuPont  alleges  that  the\r                                           \r\n\nconditions  in the  strip cell in  which he  was occasionally\r\n\nconfined  in  1994  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment.    Even\r\n\nassuming that  the conditions he describes  were sufficiently\r\n\nserious deprivations to establish a constitutional violation,\r\n\nDuPont  has  not  shown  facts  to  indicate that  any  named\r\n\ndefendant knew  of and disregarded  an excessive risk  to his\r\n\nsafety.  Thus,  he has  not shown  the requisite  \"deliberate\r\n\nindifference\"  to warrant  any relief,  at  this time,  on an\r\n\nEighth  Amendment claim.  See  Farmer v. Brennan,  114 S.

We  note that\r\ndiscovery orders are not  generally appealable prior to entry\r\nof  final  judgment.    See  9  Moore's  Federal  Practice   \r                                                                      \r\n110.13[2],  at 132 (2d ed. 1996).

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DuPont is incarcerated at MCI-Cedar Junction in Massachusetts.  In 1992, he filed a pro se civil rights action against various Department of Corrections personnel and others, seeking damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  Among other things, he alleged that defendants had violated his rights by using excessive force against him, seizing his legal materials, denying him medical care, and threatening to confine him in a disciplinary unit.  At the time he filed his complaint, DuPont was in the Departmental Segregation Unit (DSU), but he was later placed in the Departmental Disciplinary Unit (DDU), where he remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, DuPont challenges the district court's denial of his request for an injunction ordering compliance with certain stipulations, agreements, or orders in the following cases:  Cepulonis v. Fair, D. Mass., No. 78-3233-Z;  Stone v. Boone, D. Mass., No. 73-1083-T;  Alston v. Fair, D. Mass., No. 77-3519-G;  Hoffer v. Fair, S.J.C. No. 85-71;  and DuPont v. Hall, Norfolk Super.  Ct. No. 87-1399.  He also objects to the court's denial of his requests for injunctions forbidding the use of chemical agents or excessive force against him, forbidding his placement in a strip cell, directing the return of postage stamps taken from his incoming mail and the return of certain legal materials, and directing his release from the DDU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court has made no clear error of law or fact in its ruling on a preliminary injunction motion, we will not disturb its conclusion absent manifest abuse of discretion.  See Cohen v. Brown University, 991 F.2d 888, 902 (1st Cir.1993).  For the reasons outlined below, we find that the district court did not overstep its bounds in denying the requested relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consent Decree Violations.   In part, DuPont seeks orders enforcing federal or state court consent decrees, but such relief is unavailable in an individual action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  See Martel v. Fridovich, 14 F.3d 1, 3 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State Law Violations.   DuPont also asserts various state law violations, e.g., that defendants have not properly promulgated certain DDU rules, did not medically screen him before placing him in the DDU, and have not provided certain law library access, all in violation of state statutes or regulations.  But he does not explain how defendants thereby violated federal law, and this court does not have the power to direct state officials to comply with state law.  See Quintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 230 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court Access.   DuPont complains that defendants violated his right to court access by restricting his ability to conduct legal research<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and by seizing legal materials from his cell.  DuPont has clearly been able to challenge his criminal conviction and sentence by filing a direct appeal and post-conviction motions in state court and by filing two habeas petitions (and appeals from the dismissal thereof) in federal court.  He has also been able to file and prosecute this action challenging the conditions of his confinement.  Nothing in the record indicates that DuPont's access to the courts has not been adequate or meaningful.  Consequently, he has not suffered the \"actual injury\" required to show a violation of his right to meaningful court access.  See Lewis v.

DuPont asserts that defendants have violated his due process liberty interest in law library access and in not being confined in the DDU by their failure to comply with obligations imposed in the cases cited in the beginning of this opinion.  Contrary to DuPont's claim, however, the Alston case did not require defendants to prepare and evaluate a health status report before placing him in the DDU, which is located at Cedar Junction as is the DSU where he was previously housed.  Alston requires the preparation and review of health status reports only before an inmate is transferred to an entirely different institution.  Likewise, Stone does not clearly grant DuPont the right to physically use the prison law library.  It requires that all inmates have supervised access to the law library unless \"special circumstances\" dictate otherwise.  Such circumstances may well encompass DuPont's confinement in the DDU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DuPont v.

DuPont's arguments on this point are not persuasive.  The affidavit by defendant DOC Commissioner Dubois to which he points affirmed that the DDU is distinct from the DSU in its disciplinary purpose.  The list of comparisons between the DSU and DDU which DuPont submitted to the district court actually describes significant differences between the two units.  Finally, while the DDU may have effectively replaced the DSU at Cedar Junction, Commissioner Dubois testified in a deposition in a different case (which is in the record before us) that he did not establish the DDU in order to evade legal obligations applicable to the DSU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his objections to the magistrate's report, DuPont raised an argument based on Sandin v. Conner, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (1995), which had just then been decided, and which the district court did not discuss in its opinion accepting the report and recommendation.  DuPont asserts that confinement in the DDU is an atypical and significant deprivation, giving him a due process liberty interest under Sandin, which defendants violated when they put him in the DDU.  The present record does not contain sufficient information to permit evaluation of this claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  For that reason, a remand to consider the Sandin claim makes no sense.  Accordingly, we affirm the denials below on the basis of the arguments originally presented to the district court, but do so without prejudice to DuPont's right to seek preliminary injunctive relief anew based on Sandin.   We remind him, however, that the district court has directed him to comply fully with Loc.  R. 7.1 in filing motions and supporting memoranda in that court, and that district courts \"are entitled to demand adherence to specific mandates contained in the [local] rules.\"  See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equal Protection.   On appeal, DuPont asserts that the particular law library access restrictions placed on him as a DDU inmate violate his equal protection rights because other inmates in \"disciplinary segregation,\" i.e., inmates in the \"locked down max end and segregation blocks 9 and 10,\" have greater library access.  This bare allegation does not establish that the inmates he refers to are situated similarly enough to DDU inmates to require similar law library rights.  See Hosna v. Groose, 80 F.3d 298, 304 n. 8 (8th Cir.)  (the district court should not presume that inmates in administrative segregation for their own protection are necessarily similarly situated with protective custody inmates), cert. denied, 1996 WL 375894 (U.S. Oct. 7, 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mail Rights While in Strip Cell.  On three occasions in 1994, defendants put DuPont in a strip cell for periods ranging from four to eleven days, during which time DuPont's incoming mail was allegedly withheld and he was also denied writing materials.  We evaluate the withholding of incoming mail under Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), see Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 413 (1989), and the restriction on outgoing mail (i.e., the denial of writing materials) under Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974).  Because the withholding of mail was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests and the restriction on outgoing mail furthered a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression and was no greater than necessary, we find no constitutional violation.  DuPont was placed in a strip cell due to intransigence sufficiently serious to require the use of chemical agents.  Restricting his mail privileges helped the state maintain order and security in the DDU by ensuring that unpleasant consequences flowed from such misbehavior.  See, e.g., Little v. Norris, 787 F.2d 1241, 1243-44 (8th Cir.1986) (\"The purpose of withholding personal mail is to make punitive isolation unpleasant, and thereby discourage improper behavior and promote security within the prison.\").  Given the limited privileges of DDU inmates, which must be earned, defendants may have had few other alternatives for inducing persistently disobedient inmates like DuPont to behave.  Moreover, the withdrawal of mail privileges was temporary.  DuPont was given his mail and permitted to write letters after leaving the strip cell.  His confinement was also relatively short in duration, lasting 11 days or less.  The restriction was content neutral, applying to all incoming and outgoing correspondence.  DuPont was permitted attorney visits and his attorney could keep him informed about pending cases.  He has not asserted the actual loss of any cause of action due to his inability to write letters or draft legal documents while confined in the strip cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Incoming Stamps.   Defendants have removed stamps from DuPont's incoming mail, citing a DDU rule prohibiting the receipt of stamps through the mail and requiring DDU inmates to buy stamps at the prison canteen.  DuPont avers that he did not have enough money in his prison account to buy stamps.  But his correspondents who desire to send him stamps may donate funds to his prison account for that purpose, instead.  See 103 Code Mass.  Regs. &#167; 405.16.  The prison also provides some free postage for personal mail and unlimited postage for necessary mail to court officials and attorneys.  Id. &#167; 481.10.  Under the circumstances, we find no constitutional violation.  See Kaestel v. Lockhart, 746 F.2d 1323, 1325 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (prison could prohibit the receipt of postal stamps through incoming mail in order to prevent inmates from using them as a source of currency outside their regular prison accounts;  inmates could obtain pre-stamped envelopes from the commissary and some funds were available for postage for indigent inmates) (applying Procunier standard);  accord Pacheco v. Comisse, 897 F.Supp. 671, 682 (N.D.N.Y.1995) (applying Turner standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seizures of Legal Materials.   DuPont objects to defendants' seizure of legal materials from his cell.  Contrary to his assertions, however, the settlement agreement in DuPont v. Hall, supra, did not give him the right to keep 12 cubic feet of legal materials in his DDU cell or the right to select materials to keep in his cell before excess materials were removed and placed in storage.  The prison's property limit regulation expressly permitted him to keep no more than 1 cubic foot of legal materials in his cell, see 103 Code Mass.  Regs. &#167; 403.09, and so defendants could remove materials exceeding that limit.  The regulation in question is not arbitrary or unreasonable simply because the federal prison system has a more generous property limit.  See Savko v. Rollins, 749 F.Supp. 1403, 1407-8 (D.Md.1990), aff'd, 924 F.2d 1053 (4th Cir.1991) (table).  Finally, defendants' seizures of his excess materials have not caused any actual injury to his right of court access, as is indicated above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Excessive Force.   DuPont seeks an injunction against defendants' use of chemical agents when removing excess legal materials from his cell, alleging that they have used excessive force and chemical agents against him on multiple occasions from 1991 to 1994.  The record indicates that chemical agents and/or forced move teams have been used against DuPont some 14 times in that time period after he has refused to obey orders or rules.  He may be able to convince a jury that excessive force was used against him on February 14, 1994, as he asserts, but that injury could be remedied through a damages award.  See Cohen, supra, 991 F.2d at 902 (the availability of adequate damages may justify denying preliminary injunctive relief).  On practically all other occasions when chemical agents were used against him, DuPont reported no injuries and medical personnel observed none.  On a few occasions, he reported old or minor injuries.  Prison officials sought medical authorization before using chemical agents on DuPont and his eyes and face were washed after their use.  We conclude, therefore, that defendants have not systematically used excessive force or improperly used chemical agents so as to justify preliminary injunctive relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Use of Strip Cells.   DuPont alleges that the conditions in the strip cell in which he was occasionally confined in 1994 violated the Eighth Amendment.  Even assuming that the conditions he describes were sufficiently serious deprivations to establish a constitutional violation, DuPont has not shown facts to indicate that any named defendant knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his safety.  Thus, he has not shown the requisite \"deliberate indifference\" to warrant any relief, at this time, on an Eighth Amendment claim.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1977 (1994);  Williams v. Delo, 49 F.3d 442, 446-47 (8th Cir.1995) (denying injunctive relief to an inmate confined in a strip cell since he had not shown that any named defendant had known of and disregarded any excessive risk to his health or safety).  DuPont filed a grievance about conditions in the strip cell with defendant DDU Director Harrington, but not until after his release from the strip cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transfer of Materials to District Court.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DuPont is incarcerated at MCI-Cedar Junction in Massachusetts.  In 1992, he filed a pro se civil rights action against various Department of Corrections personnel and others, seeking damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  Among other things, he alleged that defendants had violated his rights by using excessive force against him, seizing his legal materials, denying him medical care, and threatening to confine him in a disciplinary unit.  At the time he filed his complaint, DuPont was in the Departmental Segregation Unit (DSU), but he was later placed in the Departmental Disciplinary Unit (DDU), where he remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this appeal, DuPont challenges the district court's denial of his request for an injunction ordering compliance with certain stipulations, agreements, or orders in the following cases:  Cepulonis v.

No. 87-1399.  He also objects to the court's denial of his requests for injunctions forbidding the use of chemical agents or excessive force against him, forbidding his placement in a strip cell, directing the return of postage stamps taken from his incoming mail and the return of certain legal materials, and directing his release from the DDU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court has made no clear error of law or fact in its ruling on a preliminary injunction motion, we will not disturb its conclusion absent manifest abuse of discretion.  See Cohen v.

In part, DuPont seeks orders enforcing federal or state court consent decrees, but such relief is unavailable in an individual action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  See Martel v.

DuPont also asserts various state law violations, e.g., that defendants have not properly promulgated certain DDU rules, did not medically screen him before placing him in the DDU, and have not provided certain law library access, all in violation of state statutes or regulations.  But he does not explain how defendants thereby violated federal law, and this court does not have the power to direct state officials to comply with state law.  See Quintero de Quintero v.

DuPont has clearly been able to challenge his criminal conviction and sentence by filing a direct appeal and post-conviction motions in state court and by filing two habeas petitions (and appeals from the dismissal thereof) in federal court.  He has also been able to file and prosecute this action challenging the conditions of his confinement.  Nothing in the record indicates that DuPont's access to the courts has not been adequate or meaningful.  Consequently, he has not suffered the \"actual injury\" required to show a violation of his right to meaningful court access.  See Lewis v.

Safley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 89 (1987), see Thornburgh v. Abbott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112258\"><a href=\"/opinion/112258/thornburgh-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 413 (1989), and the restriction on outgoing mail (i.e., the denial of writing materials) under Procunier v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109016\"><a href=\"/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1974).  Because the withholding of mail was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests and the restriction on outgoing mail furthered a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression and was no greater than necessary, we find no constitutional violation.  DuPont was placed in a strip cell due to intransigence sufficiently serious to require the use of chemical agents.  Restricting his mail privileges helped the state maintain order and security in the DDU by ensuring that unpleasant consequences flowed from such misbehavior.  See, e.g., Little v. Norris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468181\"><a href=\"/opinion/468181/edward-eugene-little-v-larry-norris-warden-tucker-maximum-security-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span>, 1243-44 (8th Cir.1986) (\"The purpose of withholding personal mail is to make punitive isolation unpleasant, and thereby discourage improper behavior and promote security within the prison.\").  Given the limited privileges of DDU inmates, which must be earned, defendants may have had few other alternatives for inducing persistently disobedient inmates like DuPont to behave.  Moreover, the withdrawal of mail privileges was temporary.  DuPont was given his mail and permitted to write letters after leaving the strip cell.  His confinement was also relatively short in duration, lasting 11 days or less.  The restriction was content neutral, applying to all incoming and outgoing correspondence.  DuPont was permitted attorney visits and his attorney could keep him informed about pending cases.  He has not asserted the actual loss of any cause of action due to his inability to write letters or draft legal documents while confined in the strip cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Incoming Stamps.   Defendants have removed stamps from DuPont's incoming mail, citing a DDU rule prohibiting the receipt of stamps through the mail and requiring DDU inmates to buy stamps at the prison canteen.  DuPont avers that he did not have enough money in his prison account to buy stamps.  But his correspondents who desire to send him stamps may donate funds to his prison account for that purpose, instead.  See 103 Code Mass.  Regs. &#167; 405.16.  The prison also provides some free postage for personal mail and unlimited postage for necessary mail to court officials and attorneys.  Id. &#167; 481.10.  Under the circumstances, we find no constitutional violation.  See Kaestel v. Lockhart, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443261\"><a href=\"/opinion/443261/rolf-kaestel-v-al-lockhart-director-of-the-arkansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></a></span>, 1325 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (prison could prohibit the receipt of postal stamps through incoming mail in order to prevent inmates from using them as a source of currency outside their regular prison accounts;  inmates could obtain pre-stamped envelopes from the commissary and some funds were available for postage for indigent inmates) (applying Procunier standard);  accord Pacheco v. Comisse, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

DuPont objects to defendants' seizure of legal materials from his cell.  Contrary to his assertions, however, the settlement agreement in DuPont v. Hall, supra, did not give him the right to keep 12 cubic feet of legal materials in his DDU cell or the right to select materials to keep in his cell before excess materials were removed and placed in storage.  The prison's property limit regulation expressly permitted him to keep no more than 1 cubic foot of legal materials in his cell, see 103 Code Mass.  Regs. &#167; 403.09, and so defendants could remove materials exceeding that limit.  The regulation in question is not arbitrary or unreasonable simply because the federal prison system has a more generous property limit.  See Savko v. Rollins, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></span>, 1407-8 (D.Md.1990), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></span> (4th Cir.1991) (table).  Finally, defendants' seizures of his excess materials have not caused any actual injury to his right of court access, as is indicated above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Excessive Force.   DuPont seeks an injunction against defendants' use of chemical agents when removing excess legal materials from his cell, alleging that they have used excessive force and chemical agents against him on multiple occasions from 1991 to 1994.  The record indicates that chemical agents and/or forced move teams have been used against DuPont some 14 times in that time period after he has refused to obey orders or rules.  He may be able to convince a jury that excessive force was used against him on February 14, 1994, as he asserts, but that injury could be remedied through a damages award.  See Cohen, supra, 991 F.2d at 902 (the availability of adequate damages may justify denying preliminary injunctive relief).  On practically all other occasions when chemical agents were used against him, DuPont reported no injuries and medical personnel observed none.  On a few occasions, he reported old or minor injuries.  Prison officials sought medical authorization before using chemical agents on DuPont and his eyes and face were washed after their use.  We conclude, therefore, that defendants have not systematically used excessive force or improperly used chemical agents so as to justify preliminary injunctive relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Use of Strip Cells.   DuPont alleges that the conditions in the strip cell in which he was occasionally confined in 1994 violated the Eighth Amendment.  Even assuming that the conditions he describes were sufficiently serious deprivations to establish a constitutional violation, DuPont has not shown facts to indicate that any named defendant knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his safety.  Thus, he has not shown the requisite \"deliberate indifference\" to warrant any relief, at this time, on an Eighth Amendment claim.  See Farmer v. Brennan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

DuPont filed a grievance about conditions in the strip cell with defendant DDU Director Harrington, but not until after his release from the strip cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transfer of Materials to District Court.

We note that discovery orders are not generally appealable prior to entry of final judgment.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice p 110.13, at 132 (2d ed.1996).  In addition, our affirmance does not rest on the ground that DuPont failed to identify the guards in question, although that reason was cited by the district court in denying preliminary injunctive relief.  Therefore, we decline to consider the district court's failure to compel discovery in this appeal.  See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico v.
