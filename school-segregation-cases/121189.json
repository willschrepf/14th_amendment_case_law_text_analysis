Civil Action No. 12-cv-1754 (RLW)\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,\n\n                     Defendant.\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiff Kathryn Sack, a University of Virginia graduate student, brings this Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) challenge against the Department of Defense (“DoD”), vis-à-vis its\n\ncomponent agencies, the Defense Intelligence Agency (“DIA”) and the National Security\n\nAgency (“NSA”). Through her remaining claims, Sack argues that DIA failed to adequately\n\nsearch for records responsive to her FOIA requests and that it improperly withheld documents\n\nunder FOIA’s statutory exemptions. Additionally, Sack complains that NSA failed to categorize\n\nher as an “educational institution” requester and wrongly failed to provide her with two free\n\nhours of search time. The matter is presently before the Court on the Department’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 22). Finding that DIA’s search methods were sound, and that\n\nDIA appropriately relied upon Exemption 7(E) to withhold the contested documents from\n\nrelease, the Court concludes that Sack’s claims involving DIA lack merit. With respect to NSA,\n\nhowever, the Court agrees that NSA should have classified Sack as an “educational institution”\n\nrequester, which means the Court need not reach the parties’ arguments surrounding the two\n\nhours of free search time. Accordingly, having carefully considered the parties’ briefing, the\n\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\fentire record in this action, and the governing authorities and precedents, the Court concludes for\n\nthe reasons that follow, that the Department’s Motion will be GRANTED.\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n    A. Factual Background\n\n       Plaintiff Kathryn Sack (“Sack”) is a University of Virginia graduate student preparing her\n\ndissertation on the issue of polygraph bias. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 4). To gather more information in\n\nconnection with her research, Sack filed eleven different FOIA requests with DIA and NSA, all\n\nof which generally sought information concerning the agencies’ polygraph programs. Although\n\nSack’s Complaint asserts thirteen (13) separate counts, the scope of her claims has narrowed\n\nconsiderably during the pendency of this action.       For purposes of this Opinion, the Court\n\nsummarizes only the salient facts bearing on the claims that remain in dispute. 2\n\n\n           1. Count II: DIA Request No. 0193-2011\n\n       On February 14, 2011, Sack filed three FOIA requests with DIA, only one of which\n\nremains at issue. Through that request, which Sack pursues through Count II of her Complaint,\n\nshe sought “[a]ll records maintained by [DIA’s] security office representing aggregate data of\n\npolygraph examinations.” (Dkt. No. 22-1 (“Williams Decl.”) at ¶ 10, Ex. 3). DIA originally\n\nresponded to Sack about one week later, on February 22, 2011, assigning her inquiry Request\n\nNo. 0193-2011. (Id. ¶ 11, Ex. 4). Inexplicably, Sack’s request then sat dormant for quite some\n\n\n\n\n1\n       In the Complaint, the plaintiff is identified as “Kathryn Sack.” Most of the documents\nfound elsewhere in the record, though, refer to a “Katelyn Sack.” This incongruity is never\nexplained by the parties, but the Court presumes that both names refer to the plaintiff here.\n2\n      For simplicity’s sake, the Court summarizes Sack’s claims in the sequence they appear in\nthe Complaint, recognizing that, in some cases, the facts do not proceed chronologically.\n                                                 2\n\ftime until April 2012, when DIA eventually tasked the National Center for Credibility\n\nAssessment (“NCCA”) to search for responsive records. (Id. ¶ 12). 3\n\n       While Sack’s request expressly sought records only from DIA’s Office of Security, DIA\n\ndetermined that responsive information was most likely to be located within NCCA, rather than\n\nthe Office of Security. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 8). In turn, NCCA searched its electronic records systems for\n\ninformation responsive to the request, using its “ProCite Database” and the NCCA shared\n\ncomputer electronic storage drive; NCCA also searched its paper filing system. (Id. ¶ 12). For\n\nits electronic search, NCCA used keywords it thought calibrated to locate any potentially\n\nresponsive records, including “bias,” “gender,” “race,” “age,” and “sexual orientation.” (Id.).\n\nMoreover, though DIA did not reasonably expect any results, DIA also asked the Office of\n\nSecurity to review its records, but the Office of Security confirmed that it does not maintain any\n\naggregate data responsive to Sack’s request. (Id.). Ultimately, neither NCCA nor the Office of\n\nSecurity located any records responsive to this particular request.\n\n\n             2. Counts V and VI: NSA Request Nos. 64010 and 64011\n\n       Sack also submitted three FOIA requests to NSA on or around February 14, 2011. Two\n\nof these requests—pled through Counts V and VI of her Complaint—remain in dispute. Therein,\n\nSack sought records representing aggregate data of polygraph examinations and records\n\npertaining to equal employment opportunity rules and polygraphs, respectively. (See Compl. at\n\n¶¶ 32-43).     Sack also sought classification as an “academic” or “educational institution”\n\n\n3\n        DIA explains—and Sack does not dispute—that NCCA “serves as the government’s\npremiere educational center for polygraph and other credibility assessment technologies and\ntechniques. Its central mission is to assist federal agencies in the protection of U.S. citizens,\ninterests, infrastructure and security by providing the best education and tools for credibility\nassessment and to manage the Quality Assurance Program that develops, implements, and\nprovides oversight of psychophysiological detection of deception (PDD) standards for the federal\npolygraph programs.” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 6).\n                                                 3\n\frequester, which would have exempted her from the search-related costs associated with her\n\nrequest. (See Dkt. No. 22-3 (“Janosek Decl.”) at Ex. 1). NSA acknowledged receipt of Sack’s\n\nrequests on March 10, 2011, assigning them case numbers 64010 and 64011. (Id., Ex. 2).\n\nThrough this same response, NSA stated that Sack could not be classified as an “academic”\n\nrequester, explaining that she did not meet the criteria for “educational institution” as defined in\n\nthe Code of Federal Regulations; more specifically, NSA did not believe Sack’s request was\n\nmade on behalf of the University of Virginia. (Id. ¶ 9, Ex. 2). 4 Instead, NSA classified Sack as\n\nan “all other” requester, which meant that under DoD regulations, Sack was obligated to pay for\n\nsearch time in excess of two hours. (Id. at Ex. 2). Based on its initial assessment, NSA\n\nestimated that the applicable search costs (not including the two free hours of search time) would\n\namount to approximately $880.00. (Id. ¶ 14, Ex. 2). NSA explained that Sack would be required\n\nto remit one-half of the total cost estimate ($440.00) before NSA would commence its search\n\nefforts.\n\n           Rather than doing so, Sack appealed this determination in May 2012. (Id. ¶ 16, Ex. 3).\n\nAs part of that appeal, Sack attached a letter from the University of Virginia’s Director of\n\nGraduate Studies, Professor Jeffrey Jenkins, stating that Sack’s objectives were “consistent with\n\n[the University’s] scholarly research goals” and confirming that Sack was “acting as a\n\nrepresentative of the University of Virginia’s Department of Politics.” (Id., Ex. 3). The NSA\n\nFOIA Appeal Authority denied Sack’s appeal by letter dated January 17, 2013. (Id. ¶ 17, Ex. 4).\n\nNSA found Mr. Jenkins’ letter insufficient because it confirmed that Sack was “a Ph.D. student\n\nand President’s Fellow rather than a member of the faculty,” and because it did not come from\n\n\n\n4\n       Sack also sought a “public interest” fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), which\nNSA denied in this same response. While part of her original claims in this case, Sack no longer\nchallenges NSA’s determination on the “public interest” waiver. (See Pl’s Opp’n at 2).\n                                                 4\n\fthe Department’s Chair. (Id.). NSA also found significant that Sack’s counsel was representing\n\nonly Sack individually, and not the University of Virginia or its Department of Politics. (Id.).\n\nThus, Sack remained classified as an “all other” requester, with NSA requiring that Sack remit a\n\nportion of the estimated search costs before it would process her requests.\n\n\n           3. Count IX: DIA Request No. 0069-2010\n\n       On October 23, 2009, Sack filed a FOIA request with DIA seeking Department of\n\nDefense Polygraph Institute (“DoDPI”) and Defense Academy of Credibility Assessment\n\n(“DACA”) records that would reflect polygraph examination bias research and studies.\n\n(Williams Decl. at ¶ 9, Ex. 8).5 Although DIA acknowledged receipt on December 18, 2009, as\n\nwith Sack’s other requests, it seems DIA did not take any further action for some time. (Id. ¶\n\n17). Eventually, in or around April 2012, DIA conducted a search for records within NCCA,\n\nboth within its paper filing system and its electronic records. (Id. ¶ 18). For purposes of the\n\nelectronic review, NCCA again searched its ProCite Database and the NCCA shared computer\n\nelectronic storage drive, using the keywords “bias,” “gender,” “race,” “age,” and “sexual\n\norientation.” (Id.). Through its search efforts, DIA located three documents (totaling 42 pages)\n\nthat were responsive to Sack’s request; all three documents were released in full, and are\n\nsummarized in DIA’s Vaughn index at entries V-8, V-9, and V-10. (Id.; see also Dkt. No. 22-2\n\n(“DIA Vaughn Index”)).\n\n\n           4. Counts XI and XII: DIA Request Nos. 0041-2012 and 0059-2012\n\n       Sack separately filed two FOIA requests with the Federal Investigative Services Division\n\n(“FIS”) of the Office of Personnel Management. The first of these requests, submitted on July 5,\n\n2011, sought records about polygraphers and polygraph examinations. (See Compl. at ¶ 67-68).\n\n5\n       DoDPI and DACA are predecessors to the NCCA. (Williams Decl. at ¶ 6).\n                                                5\n\fThe second request was filed on October 14, 2011, and sought “records pertaining to periodic\n\nreviews of agencies’ polygraph programs.” (Id. ¶ 74). With respect to the first request, FIS\n\nreferred two records to DIA for direct response: a Quality Assurance Program Inspection Report,\n\nand a Polygraph Memorandum of Agreement.            (Williams Decl. at ¶ 22).     Invoking FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, and 7(E), DIA withheld the Quality Assurance Program Inspection Report in\n\nfull, and though it produced the Polygraph Memorandum of Agreement, DIA redacted portions\n\nof the document pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3 and 6. (Id. ¶ 23, Ex. 11; Vaughn Index). Sack\n\nwas notified of this determination by letter dated March 5, 2013. (Williams Decl. at Ex. 11). As\n\nfor the second request, FIS referred another seven records to DIA for direct response, all of\n\nwhich consisted of additional Quality Assurance Program Inspection Reports. (Williams Decl. at\n\n¶ 24; Vaughn Index). DIA withheld all seven documents from production, pursuant to FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, and 7(E). (Id.).\n\n\n           5. Count XIII: DIA Request No. 0135-2011\n\n       Sack submitted a separate FOIA request to DIA on December 23, 2010, seeking all\n\ncorrespondence dating back to 2002 between DIA employees and Sheila Reed, who the parties\n\ndescribe as “a well-known polygraph researcher.” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 25, Ex. 12). After\n\nconfirming receipt of this request by letter dated January 5, 2011, it appears DIA did not pursue\n\nSack’s request any further for some time. (Id. ¶ 26). Eventually, NCCA conducted a search for\n\npotentially responsive materials, within both its paper files and its electronic records. (Id.). As\n\nsearch terms, DIA utilized “Sheila Reed” and “Reed, Sheila,” searching its ProCite Database and\n\nthe NCCA share computer electronic storage drive. (Id.). No responsive records were located as\n\na result of NCCA’s search, and DIA advised Sack of these results by letter on January 23, 2013.\n\n(Id. ¶¶ 27-28, Ex. 13).\n\n\n                                                6\n\f    B. Procedural History\n\n       Sack filed her thirteen-count complaint initiating this FOIA action against DoD on\n\nOctober 30, 2012. 6 Since then, Sack has withdrawn or abandoned several claims. Through the\n\nJoint Status Report, Sack voluntarily dismissed Count III on January 18, 2013. (See Dkt. No. 12\n\nat ¶ 1(3)). The parties then proceeded with a stipulated summary judgment briefing schedule.\n\nThe Department filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on March 22, 2013, (Dkt. No. 22\n\n(“Def.’s MSJ”)), and through her opposition brief, filed on April 22, 2013, Sack expressly\n\nwithdrew her claims under Counts I, IV, and VIII, (see Dkt. No. 23 (“Pl.’s Opp’n”) at 2-3).\n\nFinally, the Department advised the Court through its reply brief that Sack has withdrawn her\n\nclaims under Count X. (See Dkt. No. 28-2). At this juncture, then, only Counts II, V, VI, VII,\n\nIX, XI, XII, and XIII remain in dispute.\n\n       In support of its motion, DoD submitted several declarations describing DIA’s and\n\nNSA’s response efforts to Sack’s FOIA requests. As to DIA, the Court received the declaration\n\nof Alesia Williams, Chief of the FOIA Services Section within the FOIA and Declassification\n\nServices Branch for the DIA. (See Williams Decl.). In addition, Ms. Williams submitted a\n\nsupplemental declaration along with the Department’s reply.      (See Dkt. No. 28-1 (“Supp.\n\nWilliams Decl.”)).   The Department also filed a detailed Vaughn index, describing DIA’s\n\nwithholdings and redactions under FOIA’s statutory exemptions. (See Vaughn Index). With\n\n\n\n\n6\n        Originally, Sack’s claims were part of a larger lawsuit. Along with DoD, that lawsuit\ninvolved FOIA claims against the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Justice, the\nOffice of Personnel Management, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. On the\ndefendants’ motion, the Court severed Sack’s claims and ordered Sack to refile those counts\nrelating to DoD through a separate action. Two related FOIA actions remain pending before the\nundersigned—Sack v. Central Intelligence Agency (12-cv-537) and Sack v. U.S. Department of\nJustice (12-cv-1755)—but the claims in those matters will be resolved separately and are not\notherwise addressed in this Memorandum Opinion.\n                                              7\n\frespect to NSA, the Court received the declaration of Diane Janosek, Deputy Associate Director\n\nfor Policy and Records for the NSA.” (See Janosek Decl.). 7\n\n       DoD’s Motion for Summary Judgment is now fully briefed and ripe for decision.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n       Through her remaining claims, Sack challenges DIA’s and NSA’s compliance with their\n\nFOIA obligations in several respects. First, through Counts II, IX, and XIII, Sack asserts that\n\nDIA failed to perform an adequate search in response to her requests. Second, Sack insists that\n\nDIA improperly invoked FOIA Exemption 7(E) to fully withhold records responsive the FOIA\n\nrequests described in Counts XI and XII. Third, Sack complains that NSA wrongly denied her\n\nrequest to be classified as an “educational institution” requester, treating her as an “all other”\n\nrequester instead. And fourth, Sack argues that NSA improperly failed to provide her with two\n\nfree hours of search time, as “all other” requesters are entitled to receive. After summarizing the\n\noverall legal principles governing its analysis, the Court addresses each issue in turn.\n\n\n    A. Applicable Legal Standards\n\n       “FOIA was intended to ‘pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency\n\naction to the light of public scrutiny.’” ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 655 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011) (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 325, 361 (1976)). In view of this\n\nobjective, FOIA requires federal agencies to release all records responsive to a proper request,\n\nunless the records fall within any of the statute’s nine enumerated exemptions. Loving v. U.S.\n\n\n7\n       DoD also submitted an affidavit from David Hardy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s\nSection Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Records Management Division.\n(See Dkt. No. 22-4 (“Hardy Decl.”). Mr. Hardy attested to DoD’s justification for redacting the\nname and telephone number of an FBI employee under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C). (See\ngenerally id.). Insofar as Sack does not challenge any redactions under Exemptions 6 or 7(C),\nhowever, the Court had no occasion to rely on Mr. Hardy’s declaration in resolving this motion.\n                                                 8\n\fDep’t of Def., 550 F.3d 32, 37 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (listing exemptions).\n\n“FOIA cases typically and appropriately are decided on motions for summary judgment.”\n\nHainey v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 925 F. Supp. 2d 34, 40 (D.D.C. 2013). As in all cases,\n\n“[s]ummary judgment is in order where, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party, the court finds that there remains no ‘genuine issue as to any material fact.’”\n\nPetroleum Info. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1433 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (quoting\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)).\n\n       When a requester challenges the adequacy of an agency’s search, the agency is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on such a claim if it can “demonstrate beyond material doubt that its search\n\nwas ‘reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.’” Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast\n\nGuard, 180 F.3d 321, 325 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Truitt v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 897 F.2d 540,\n\n542 (D.C. Cir. 1990)); see also Nation Magazine v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 890 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1995). In many cases, “[s]ummary judgment may be based on affidavit, if the declaration\n\nsets forth sufficiently detailed information for a court to determine if the search was adequate.”\n\nStudents Against Genocide v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 257 F.3d 828, 838 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (internal\n\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). “If, however, the record leaves substantial doubt as to the\n\nsufficiency of the search, summary judgment for the agency is not proper.” Truitt, 897 F.2d at\n\n542. The governing standard “is not whether there might exist any other documents possibly\n\nresponsive to the request, but rather whether the search for those documents was adequate,”\n\nWeisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (emphasis in original),\n\nand “adequacy is measured by the reasonableness of the effort in light of the specific request,”\n\nLarson v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 869 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Put another\n\nway, to secure summary judgment, “the agency must show that it made a good faith effort to\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fconduct a search for the requested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to\n\nproduce the information requested.” Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n         When an agency withholds records in response to a FOIA request, the agency “bears the\n\nburden of proving the applicability of claimed exemptions.” ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 628\n\nF.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Public Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt. & Budget, 598 F.3d 865,\n\n869 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Inasmuch as “FOIA mandates a strong presumption in favor of disclosure\n\n. . . the statutory exemptions, which are exclusive, are to be narrowly construed.” Nat’l Ass’n of\n\nHome Builders v. Norton, 309 F.3d 26, 32 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (internal citations and quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Summary judgment is proper for the agency when its “affidavits describe the\n\njustifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the information\n\nwithheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by either contrary\n\nevidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 862 (quoting\n\nMiller v. Casey, 730 F.2d 773, 776 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). “Ultimately, an agency’s justification for\n\ninvoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears ‘logical’ or ‘plausible.’” Id. (quoting Wolf\n\nv. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374-75 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). As a result, “[t]o successfully challenge an\n\nagency’s showing that it complied with the FOIA, the plaintiff must come forward with ‘specific\n\nfacts’ demonstrating that there is a genuine issue with respect to whether the agency has\n\nimproperly withheld extant agency records.” Span v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 696 F. Supp. 2d 113,\n\n119 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 142 (1989)).\n\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f   B. The Adequacy Of DIA’s Searches\n\n           1. Count II\n\n       Count II concerns Sack’s request for information from DIA’s Office of Security\n\n“representing aggregate data of polygraph examinations.” (See Compl. at ¶ 14). As set forth\n\nabove, DIA’s ensuing search for records yielded no results. Displeased with this result, Sack\n\nnow contests the adequacy of DIA’s search efforts on several fronts. First, Sack complains that\n\nDIA too narrowly interpreted her request as limited to “bias-related” records, when the request\n\nsought aggregate polygraph data generally and had “nothing to do with bias.” (Pl.’s Opp’n at 7).\n\nSecond, Sack assails DIA for listing only some of the terms used during its search, rather than all\n\nof the terms, arguing that this showing cannot satisfy DIA’s obligation to demonstrate an\n\nadequate search. Third, Sack contends that DIA wrongly focused its search on polygraph\n\nexaminers, rather than polygraph examinations, as the request sought.\n\n       The Court can quickly dispense with the latter two arguments. Both contentions spring\n\nfrom the content of Ms. Williams’ original declaration in this case. Therein, Ms. Williams\n\nattested that NCCA conducted its electronic search using “keywords, such as ‘bias,’ ‘gender,’\n\n‘race,’ ‘age,’ and ‘sexual orientation.’” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 12) (emphasis added). She also\n\naverred that “the Office of Security reported that the office does not maintain any aggregate data\n\nconcerning polygraph examiners.” (Id.) (emphasis added). Sack seizes upon these statements in\n\ninsisting that DIA has not satisfied its FOIA obligations—both because the agency failed to\n\ndelineate the full contours of its review (providing an illustrative, rather than exhaustive, list of\n\nsearch terms), and because it searched for the wrong records (i.e., data regarding polygraph\n\nexaminers, rather than polygraph examinations). Whatever weight these arguments might carry\n\nin another case, Ms. Williams’ supplemental declaration neutralizes their impact here. Ms.\n\nWilliams confirmed that despite her inclusion of the phrase “such as” in her original declaration,\n                                                 11\n\fthe search terms she listed consisted of the entire universe of terms used during DIA’s electronic\n\nreview of NCCA records. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 5). Additionally, Ms. Williams explained\n\nthat her reference to “polygraph examiners” was simply a typographical error; she confirmed that\n\nDIA actually interpreted Sack’s request as seeking “aggregate data of polygraph examinations,”\n\nand she confirmed with the Office of Security and NCCA that the offices interpreted Sack’s\n\nrequest the same and searched accordingly. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 6-7). In view of these clarifications,\n\nSack’s arguments on these points are unavailing.\n\n       Sack’s remaining argument—that DIA inappropriately narrowed her request as seeking\n\nonly bias-related information—merits some further discussion. But ultimately, this theory too\n\nfails to persuade. According to Sack, her request was broadly-phrased, calling for all aggregate\n\ndata regarding polygraph examinations. And because DIA limited its electronic search of NCCA\n\nrecords to bias-related keywords, Sack insists that this search cannot be deemed adequate. For\n\nits part, DIA rejoins that after consulting with NCCA leadership, it was determined that a search\n\nusing the term “aggregate data” would not yield any results. Instead, DIA and NCCA leadership\n\ndetermined that “searching for information related to bias or unfairness was most likely to locate\n\nrecords responsive to plaintiff’s request.” (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 5). In the Court’s view,\n\nboth sides overlook a critical issue in pressing these arguments—the specific scope of Sack’s\n\nFOIA request. Sack’s request was explicitly limited to records maintain by DIA’s “security\n\noffice,” (Williams Decl., Ex. 2), which means that the parties’ debate surrounding DIA’s search\n\nof NCCA records—as compared with records maintained by the Office of Security, as Sack\n\nactually requested—largely misses the mark.\n\n       As our Circuit has repeatedly recognized, “adequacy is measured by the reasonableness\n\nof the effort in light of the specific request.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 869 (quoting Meeropol v.\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fMeese, 790 F.2d 942, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). This means that an agency “is not obliged to look\n\nbeyond the four corners of the request for leads to the location of responsive documents.”\n\nKowalczyk v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 73 F.3d 386, 389 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Here, the four corners of\n\nSack’s request clearly limited the scope of records she was seeking to records maintained by the\n\nOffice of Security, not the NCCA. And though Sack summarily complains that DIA fails to\n\ndescribe its search efforts in relation to the Office of Security altogether, the Court disagrees.\n\n        Ms. Williams avers that DIA consulted with “senior leaders” in the Office of Security,\n\nand that those leaders confirmed the Office of Security does not maintain aggregate data; instead\n\nits records systems are limited to “the individual personal polygraph examination reports of the\n\nmany DIA and DoD employees who have been required to submit to a polygraph examination.”\n\n(Supp. Williams Decl. ¶ 7). In addition, “[t]he Office of Security leadership confirmed that it has\n\nnot endeavored to develop aggregate data from these individual files or reports.” (Id.). The\n\nCourt finds that this explanation—derived from DIA’s consultation with senior officials familiar\n\nwith the Office of Security’s records—demonstrates that DIA appropriately approached Sack’s\n\nrequest and that a more detailed search on the Office of Security’s part would have been “futile\n\nand . . . unnecessary.” American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland\n\nSec., 516 F. Supp. 2d 83, 88 (D.D.C. 2007); see also Amnesty Int’l U.S.A. v. CIA, No. 07 Civ.\n\n5435, 2008 WL 2519908, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 2008) (“FOIA does not demand a search\n\nthat would be futile.”). 8\n\n        Moreover, setting aside the question of whether the scope of Sack’s request obligated\n\nDIA to search NCCA’s records systems, the Court agrees that it was at least reasonable for DIA\n\n8\n        Relatedly, DIA’s Office of Security had no obligation to compile its individual polygraph\nreports into an aggregate form to respond to Sack’s request. FOIA “does not impose any duty on\nthe agency to create records.” ACLU, 655 F.3d at 5 n.3 (quoting Forsham v. Harris, 445 U.S.\n169, 186 (1980)) (internal alterations omitted).\n                                                  13\n\fto do so, given its belief that responsive information was most likely to be found within NCCA\n\nrecords, if anywhere. See, e.g., Lechliter v. Rumsfeld, 182 F. App’x 113, 115-16 (3d Cir. 2006)\n\n(deeming reasonable the agency’s decision to search two offices “determined to be the only ones\n\nlikely to possess responsive documents”); Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 822 F. Supp. 2d 12, 19 (D.D.C. 2011) (finding it reasonable to direct search\n\nefforts “at the people and offices most likely to have responsive information”). And in carrying\n\nout that aspect of its search, it was equally reasonable for DIA to rely upon the bias- and EEO-\n\nrelated search terms it used. As noted, DIA determined, in consultation with NCCA officials,\n\nthat a search for “aggregate data” would have been fruitless. In turn, the agency interpreted the\n\nscope of Sack’s request in a manner consistent with the scope of Sack’s accompanying FOIA\n\nrequests to DIA, all of which sought bias- and EEO-related information related to polygraphs.\n\n(See Williams Decl., Exs. 1, 5). Under the totality of the circumstances, this was an appropriate\n\napproach. See Rein v. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, 553 F.3d 353, 363 (4th Cir. 2009)\n\n(concluding that agency’s “decision to use the searches conducted in response to [prior, similar]\n\nrequests as the starting point for responding to [current] requests was not inherently unreasonable\n\nand appears to be a practical and common-sense approach,” since “[t]he requests sought similar\n\ninformation related to the same subject matter”).\n\n       In sum, the Court concludes that DIA met its FOIA obligations to conduct a reasonable\n\nand adequate search for potentially responsive records as to Count II of the Complaint.\n\n\n           2. Count IX\n\n       Through Count IX, Sack challenges DIA’s response to her request for studies pertaining\n\nto polygraph bias. While DIA produced three responsive records, detailed at entries V-8, V-9,\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fand V10 of DIA’s Vaughn index, Sack nevertheless contests the adequacy of DIA’s search\n\nefforts. In so doing, Sack presses two familiar arguments. Neither is persuasive.\n\n       First, Sack assails Ms. Williams’ use of the phrase “such as” in introducing the search\n\nterms used by NCCA. The Court rejects this argument for the reasons already stated; as with\n\nCount II, Ms. Williams subsequently confirmed that the search terms listed were the only terms\n\nused by DIA in carrying out this search. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 8). Second, Sack again\n\ncomplains about DIA’s failure to provide specific information concerning the nature of the\n\nsearch performed within the Office of Security. But again, Sack is wrong. As before, Ms.\n\nWilliams attests that through discussions with Office of Security leadership, DIA determined that\n\nit was “highly unlikely that [responsive] records would be located” within the office, insofar as\n\nthe Office of Security maintains only individual employee polygraph reports, and not research or\n\nstudies about polygraph biases. (Id. ¶¶ 7-8). This explanation sufficiently establishes that a\n\nmore detailed search was unnecessary and would have been futile.       See American-Arab Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Comm., 516 F. Supp. 2d at 88; Amnesty Int’l, 2008 WL 2519908, at *11.\n\nMoreover, despite the unlikelihood that responsive records would be found in the Office of\n\nSecurity, the record establishes that the Office of Security searched its electronic files anyway,\n\nusing the same keywords as NCCA—keywords with which Sack does not take issue for purposes\n\nof this particular request. (Williams Decl. at ¶ 18; Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶¶ 8-9). Despite\n\nthese efforts, DIA did not uncover any responsive records. Simply put, DIA’s search efforts in\n\nresponse to this request comported with its obligations under FOIA, and none of Sack’s\n\narguments establishes otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f           3. Count XIII\n\n      Sack next takes issue with DIA’s response to her request for correspondence between DIA\n\nemployees and Sheila Reed, as pled through Count XIII. In so arguing, Sack mounts two\n\nseparate challenges to the adequacy of DIA’s search. First, Sack argues that DIA wrongly\n\nconfined its search efforts to NCCA, when it should have reviewed records held by other\n\ncomponents of DIA, particularly the Office of Security. Second, Sack argues that even DIA’s\n\nsearch within NCCA fell short, insofar as DIA inappropriately neglected to review NCCA’s\n\nemail systems for potentially responsive documents. Neither theory is availing.\n\n      To begin with, the record establishes that DIA’s focus on NCCA’s records systems, as\n\nopposed to documents with the Office of Security, was reasonable and appropriate. As set forth\n\nin Ms. Williams’ declaration, DIA consulted directly with leadership from the Office of Security\n\nand ultimately determined that a search of Office of Security records was unlikely to uncover\n\nany responsive records. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 16). According to Ms. Williams, “[t]he\n\nOffice of Security does not conduct polygraph research,” but is instead focused on “conduct[ing]\n\npolygraph examinations based on the guidance provided by the NCCA.” (Id.). She further avers\n\nthat none of the leadership staff members are personally acquainted with Ms. Reed, such that\n\nthey would be likely to possess responsive email messages; indeed, the Office of Security\n\nleadership confirmed that they have not had any communication with Ms. Reed. (Id.). Based on\n\nthis assessment, the Court agrees that an additional search of the Office of Security’s records was\n\nunnecessary. See American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 516 F. Supp. 2d at 88; Amnesty\n\nInt’l, 2008 WL 25119908, at *11. To the contrary, based on NCCA’s mission of assisting\n\nfederal agencies with education and tools for credibility assessment, it was appropriate for DIA\n\nto conclude that any responsive records were likely to be found within NCCA, and to focus its\n\nsearch efforts accordingly. See Lechliter, 182 F. App’x at 115-16; Citizens for Responsibility &\n                                                16\n\fEthics in Wash., 822 F. Supp. 2d at 19. At bottom, Sack is effectively arguing that responsive\n\ndocuments might exist elsewhere within DIA, but she offers nothing beyond her own supposition\n\nin support of this theory. This approach simply comes up short. See, e.g., Hodge v. FBI, 703\n\nF.3d 575, 580 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“As we have said before, mere speculation that as yet uncovered\n\ndocuments may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency conducted a reasonable\n\nsearch.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      As for Sack’s second argument, it is now effectively moot. Ms. Williams confirms that\n\nDIA has since undertaken a supplemental search of NCCA’s email systems and archives for\n\npotentially responsive records, using Ms. Reed’s first and last name as search terms in the “to”\n\nand “from” fields of messages. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 15). These additional search efforts\n\ndid not yield any responsive records. Accordingly, the Court concludes that DIA discharged its\n\nFOIA obligations with respect to Sack’s claim under Count XIII.\n\n\n    C. DIA’s Withholdings: FOIA Exemption 7(E)\n\n       Along with her claims surrounding DIA’s search efforts, Sack also insists that DIA\n\nimproperly withheld responsive documents under FOIA’s statutory exemptions. In particular,\n\nSack contends that DIA wrongly invoked Exemption 7(E) to withhold the various Quality\n\nAssurance Program Inspection Reports (“QAP Reports”) that were uncovered during DIA’s\n\nsearch. (See Vaughn Index, V-1, V-2, V-3, V-4, V-5, V-6, V-7, V-11). 9\n\n       “Exemption 7(E) shields information if ‘disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.’” Mayer Brown LLP v. IRS, 562 F.3d 1190, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E)). In this Circuit, “Exemption 7(E) sets a relatively low bar for\n\n9\n       Although DIA redacted portions of these same documents (and others) pursuant to FOIA\nExemptions 3, 6, and 7(C), Sack does not challenge the propriety of these withholdings. (See\nPl.’s Opp’n at 11). Instead, Sack strictly takes issue with DIA’s reliance on Exemption 7(E) to\nwithhold the entirety of the above-referenced documents in full.\n                                                17\n\fthe agency to justify withholding: ‘Rather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing\n\nhow the law will be circumvented, exemption 7(E) only requires that the [agency] demonstrate\n\nlogically how the release of the requested information might create a risk of circumvention of the\n\nlaw.’” Blackwell v. FBI, 646 F.3d 37, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Mayer Brown LLP, 562 F.3d\n\nat 1194) (alteration in original). With respect to the QAP Reports at issue, DIA maintains that\n\n“disclosure of this particular information could diminish the effectiveness of polygraph\n\nexamination as an investigative tool.” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 25). As DIA explains things, “the\n\nrole of the NCCA in examining the polygraph programs of other agencies”—and, in turn, in\n\ncreating these QAP Reports—“was to identify the potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that\n\nmay allow bad actors to fool that agency and conduct illegal activities without detection.” (Id. ¶\n\n26). According to DIA, then, “[i]f this information [were] disclosed to the general public, . . . a\n\ndetermined bad actor could identify agencies with greater polygraph program vulnerabilities”\n\nthat “could then be exploited.” (Id.). The Court agrees that this explanation satisfies Exemption\n\n7(E)’s standards to justify DIA’s withholdings.\n\n       None of Sack’s arguments to the contrary compel a different outcome. Sack first seeks to\n\ndistinguish between polygraph examinations conducted as part of a criminal investigation, on the\n\none hand, and employment-related polygraph programs, on the other. In her view, while the\n\nrelease of information concerning polygraph examinations of criminal suspects could jeopardize\n\npublic safety and risk the subversion of law—thus justifying the withholding of “all polygraph\n\ninformation,” (see Pl.’s Opp’n at 14) —details surrounding the employment-screening polygraph\n\nprocesses used by federal agencies pose no such risk. While the Court recognizes that there are\n\ncertainly some distinctions between the two scenarios, neither the case law nor common sense\n\nsupports the hard line in the sand Sack seeks to draw. True, much of the precedent supporting the\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fwithholding of polygraph information under Exemption 7(E) arises in the criminal investigatory\n\ncontext. See, e.g., Piper v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 294 F. Supp. 2d 16, 30 (D.D.C. 2003)\n\n(collecting cases).   But the D.C. Circuit’s precedents make clear that the application of\n\nExemption 7(E) should not be so narrowly cabined. As DIA rightly observes, our Court of\n\nAppeals has upheld the invocation of Exemption 7(E) to withhold information that could\n\nreasonably be expected to allow insight into the CIA’s clearance and investigatory processes\n\nused during the background investigations of its officers. See Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108,\n\n1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“It is self-evident that information revealing security clearance\n\nprocedures could render those procedures vulnerable and weaken their effectiveness at\n\nuncovering background information on potential candidates.”). Cf. Tax Analysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d\n\n71, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“An agency may seek to block the disclosure of internal agency\n\nmaterials relating to guidelines, techniques, sources, and procedures for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions, even when the materials have not been compiled in the course of\n\na specific investigation.”). The Circuit’s reasoning in Morley applies with equal force here.\n\n       Disclosure of the QAP Reports could reasonably be expected to circumvent the efficacy\n\nof background investigations undertaken by federal agencies.         Indeed, these concerns are\n\nparticularly heightened in this case, given that the QAP Reports in contention pertain to the\n\npolygraph screening programs of federal law enforcement agencies—the United States Secret\n\nService; the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n\nFirearms, and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration. (See Vaughn Index V-1,\n\nV-2, V-3, V-4, V-5, V-6, V-7, V-11). The Court agrees that placing this information in the\n\npublic domain at least creates a risk that bad actors could leverage those details to subvert the\n\nbackground screening process, thereby gaining access to sensitive (if not classified) information\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fthat could be exploited to harm national security and homeland security interests. The Court thus\n\nrejects Sack’s contention that because the QAP Reports relate to employment-based polygraph\n\nprograms, their disclosure does not implicate the sort of risks that would justify the invocation of\n\nExemption 7(E).\n\n       Second, Sack asserts that even though some of the information in the QAP reports may\n\nbe properly exempt from disclosure, DIA failed to satisfy its segregability obligations to release\n\ninformation that, at least in Sack’s mind, poses no risk of circumvention of the law. More\n\nspecifically, Sack does not dispute that the sections of the QAP Reports “describing uncorrected\n\nvulnerabilities in agencies’ polygraph programs is properly exempt” under Exemption 7(E).\n\n(Pl.’s Opp’n at 11) (emphasis in original); (Id. at 14) (“Sack concedes that information which\n\nwould highlight current vulnerabilities in intelligence and law enforcement agencies’\n\nemployment screening polygraph programs would be properly exempt.”) (emphasis in original).\n\nInstead, Sack takes issue with DIA’s withholding of those aspects of the QAP Reports pertaining\n\nto vulnerabilities that “have been fixed or did not exist in the first place.” (Id.). In the Court’s\n\nview, this is a distinction without a meaningful difference. Forcing DIA to release details\n\nconcerning the efficacy of polygraph programs used by federal law enforcement agencies—\n\nwhether related to vulnerabilities, strengths, or otherwise—implicates the threats and dangers\n\noutlined above, creating at least a risk that subversive individuals will be armed with advanced\n\nknowledge of the procedures used by the United States to screen applicants for sensitive\n\nemployment positions and security clearances. In short, Sack’s efforts to cast various aspects of\n\nthe withheld QAP Reports outside of Exemption 7(E)’s reach are simply unpersuasive.\n\n       Finally, Sack assails DIA for assertedly misrepresenting that the QAP Reports were\n\nvoluntarily created at the request of agencies, when the QAP Reports were mandated under\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fOffice of Personnel Management policy. Sack suggests that these circumstances undermine the\n\npropriety of DIA’s withholdings. For its part, DIA disclaims any intent to “leave the impression\n\nthat a law enforcement agency pursues this type of inspection without any requirement to do so.”\n\n(Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 13). Either way, this argument is much ado about nothing. Whether\n\nthe QAP Reports are created in connection with mandatory or voluntary inspections, the end\n\nresult is the same: the content of these documents summarizes the polygraph programs of federal\n\nlaw enforcement agencies, and for the reasons stated, the release of that information “could\n\nreasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.” Mayer Brown LLP, 562 F.3d at 1192.\n\n       In sum, the Court agrees that DIA has met its burden to demonstrate that the QAP\n\nReports uncovered during its search were properly withheld under Exemption 7(E).\n\n\n   D. Sack’s Request That NSA Classify Her As An “Educational Institution” Requester\n\n       Unlike her claims against DIA, Sack’s remaining claims against NSA do not stem from\n\nan allegedly inadequate search or the invocation of supposedly inapplicable exemptions. Indeed,\n\nwith respect to the specific FOIA requests at issue, NSA did not even undertake a search for\n\npotentially responsive records, and it certainly did not withhold any such records under FOIA’s\n\nstatutory exemptions. Rather, Sack alleges that NSA improperly refused to classify her as an\n\n“educational institution” requester for purposes of FOIA’s fee provisions.\n\n       Under FOIA, fees assessed in connection with a request generally include “reasonable\n\nstandard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records are requested for\n\ncommercial use.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). That said, “[t]he fees required by FOIA are\n\nreduced for certain categories of requesters.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 122\n\nF. Supp. 2d 13, 20 (D.D.C. 2000).        As relevant here, “when records are not sought for\n\ncommercial use and the request is made by an educational . . . institution,” the statute provides\n\n\n                                               21\n\fthat “fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). In other words, when records are sought by an “educational institution”—as\n\nthat term is interpreted in the FOIA context—the requester is not assessed fees for time spent\n\nsearching for and reviewing potentially responsive records; the requester is responsible solely for\n\nduplication costs. See Nat’l Sec. Archive v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 880 F.2d 1381, 1382-83 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1989) (“In such cases, an agency may impose upon the requester only the cost of duplicating\n\nthe records it releases.”).    The Court has jurisdiction to review an agency’s fee-category\n\ndetermination. Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 241 F. Supp. 2d 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\nAnd though the appropriate scope of judicial review appears somewhat unsettled, see Nat’l Sec.\n\nArchive, 880 F.2d at 1383 (declining to resolve the question), both parties here agree that the\n\nCourt’s review should be de novo, and limited to the record before NSA at the time of its\n\ndetermination. With this framework in mind, the Court turns to the question at hand.\n\n       Sack maintains that as a representative of the University of Virginia’s Department of\n\nPolitical Science—and, more specifically, as a University representative seeking information in\n\nfurtherance of the Department’s scholarly research goals—she should have been classified under\n\nthe “educational institution” fee category. For its part, NSA rejoins that the information put\n\nforward by Sack was insufficient to establish that she was acting on behalf of the University or\n\nthe Department at the time she submitted her FOIA requests, rather than pursuing her own\n\nindividual research goals.     While both sides mount credible arguments in support of their\n\npositions, on balance, the Court agrees with NSA that Sack failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nto justify her classification as an “educational institution” requester.\n\n       The Court notes at the outset that there is a dearth of authority concerning this particular\n\nquestion. As a starting point, DoD regulations define the term “educational institution” as:\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f       [A] pre-school, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution\n       of graduate high education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an\n       institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education,\n       which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.\n\n32 C.F.R. § 286.28(e)(4). Further, the OMB fee guidelines—to which agency regulations must\n\nconform, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i)—make clear that the “educational institution” category\n\nextends to representatives acting on behalf of the institution, as long as the request “serves a\n\nscholarly research goal of the institution.” OMB Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee\n\nSchedule and Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. 10,012, 10,014 (Mar. 27, 1987); see also 132 Cong. Rec.\n\nS14298 (Sept. 30, 1986) (remarks of Sen. Leahy) (“A request made by a professor or other\n\nmember of the professional staff of an educational . . . institution should be presumed to have\n\nbeen made by the institution.”). The OMB fee guidelines elaborate on this concept with some\n\nconcrete examples, explaining that:\n\n       [A] request from a professor of geology at a State university for records relating\n       to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, could be\n       presumed to be from an educational institution. A request from the same person\n       for drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a\n       murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional\n       request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationary.\n                                *              *              *\n       The institutional versus individual test would apply to student requests as well.

Reg. at 10,014. As explained in the Justice Department FOIA Guide, “[t]o qualify for\n\ninclusion in this fee subcategory, the request must serve a scholarly research goal of the\n\ninstitution, not an individual goal. Thus, a student seeking inclusion in this subcategory, who\n\n‘makes a request in furtherance of the completion of a course of instruction is carrying out an\n\nindividual research goal,’ and would not qualify as an educational institution requester.” U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act, p. 102 (2009) (emphasis\n\n                                               23\n\fadded) (citing the OMB fee guidelines). As one commentator recently conceded (plaintively),\n\nthe OMB fee guidelines confirm that individual research projects serve a “training” function for\n\nthe student and do not meet the FOIA educational institutional exemption. Pall, The High Costs\n\nof Costs: Fees as Barriers to Access Within the United States and Canadian Freedom of\n\nInformation Regimes, 7 Cardozo Pub. L. Pol'y & Ethics J. 599, 622 (2009). The wisdom of this\n\nstatutory and regulatory scheme is not before the Court, only its application to the record.\n\n       Under this framework, the Court finds that Sack did not sufficiently establish she was\n\nacting on behalf of the University’s Department of Politics through her requests, or that she was\n\nseeking the requested information in furtherance of the University’s scholarly goals.          As an\n\ninitial matter, Sack’s original proffer to the NSA—essentially consisting of her own, conclusory\n\nassertion that her requests fell under the “educational institution” category, (see Janosek Decl.,\n\nEx. 1)—was plainly inadequate. On appeal, Sack supplied NSA with a letter—written on\n\nUniversity of Virginia letterhead and signed by the Director of Graduate Studies in the\n\nDepartment of Politics, Professor Jeffrey Jenkins—which stated that Sack’s research objectives\n\nwere “consistent with U. Va.’s scholarly research goals,” that Sack’s requests were submitted\n\n“on behalf of [the] institution,” and that Sack was “acting as a representative of the University of\n\nVirginia’s Department of Politics.” (Id., Ex. 3). In NSA’s view, this proffer still fell short, and\n\nthe agency concluded that Mr. Jenkins’ contention that Sack was representing the Department of\n\nPolitics was “not supportable.” (Id., Ex. 4). While it is a close question, the Court agrees.\n\nProfessor Jenkins’ letter was wholly conclusory – while he asserted that Sack’s request was “on\n\nbehalf of the institution,” he did not specify that the request was being used to support a research\n\nproject being carried out by him, any other professor, or any department of the university.\n\nInstead, his letter parroted the language from Sack’s original request, which was that she\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f“intend[ed] to review, evaluate, synthesize, and present the requested data, analyses, policies,\n\nprotocols, and practices in a publically available, usable form,” adding that “[t]his intention is\n\nconsistent with U. Va.’s scholarly research goals.”         (Id., Ex. 3).   Sack’s original request\n\nidentified her as a Ph.D. student preforming research, and NSA was entitled to conclude that her\n\nrequest furthered an “individual research goal” associated with completing a course of her\n\ngraduate studies or her dissertation. Professor Jenkins’ letter could have made clear that Sack’s\n\nresearch was for something other than fulfilling her course requirements, but it conspicuously\n\nfailed to do so.\n\n        In sum, all of Sack’s submissions contained vague and conclusory wording that evaded\n\nthe central question presented by the OMB fee guidelines: whether the request was for Sack’s\n\ncoursework, or whether it was for a project sponsored by the educational institution. Sack, as the\n\nrequester, had the burden of proof on this issue, and her proof was simply insufficient. To hold\n\notherwise would allow a student’s FOIA request supporting her coursework to fall within the\n\neducational institution exemption, so long as the request does not mention her coursework and so\n\nlong as an instructor asserts (without explanation) that the request is “on behalf of the institution”\n\nand that the student’s research is “consistent” with the goals of the institution. This would be an\n\nend-run around the OMB fee guidelines. Accordingly, the Court holds that NSA did not err by\n\nrefusing to classify Sack as an “educational institution” requester for purposes of FOIA Requests\n\n64010 and 64011. 10\n\n\n\n\n10\n        The Court pauses to emphasize the narrow scope of its holding. In the future, Sack or\nany other student requester can qualify for “educational institution” classification under FOIA by\nsupplying the agency with confirmation—on institutional letterhead, and written by an\nappropriate official—that the research underlying the student’s request is not in furtherance of\nthe student’s coursework and is made on behalf of the institution and in furtherance of research\nsponsored by the institution.\n                                                 25\n\f       Finally, the Court need not tarry long on Sack’s alternative challenge to NSA’s policies\n\nsurrounding two free search hours. Plaintiff does not dispute that she refused to either pay fees\n\nor commit to making any payment on the requests at issue. NSA’s requirement that Plaintiff\n\nremit payment in the amount of $440.00, which is one-half of the total amount of the estimated\n\ncosts, minus the free search time, (Id., Ex. 2), is in accordance with its regulations, 32 C.F.R. §\n\n286.28(e)(2)(i)(B), which unambiguously state that “a search for responsive records will not be\n\ninitiated until the requester indicates a willingness to pay assessable costs appropriate for the\n\ncategory determined by the Component.”         See Janosek Decl. ¶ 25. Nothing in the FOIA\n\nprecludes an agency from first requiring that the payment and scope of a request be clear before\n\nany search is conducted. See Chaplin v. Stewart, 796 F. Supp. 2d 209, 211-12 (D.D.C. 2011)\n\n(finding that the agency was entitled to judgment as a matter of law where agency complied with\n\nDOJ regulations by informing plaintiff about the fee requirements and suggesting ways to reduce\n\nhis costs and plaintiff neither paid nor committed to paying the assessed fees); Saldana v. Bureau\n\nof Prisons, 715 F. Supp. 2d 10, 16-17, 21 (D.D.C. 2010) (“because [plaintiff] neither reduced the\n\nscope of his January 2006 request nor paid, or agreed to pay, the associated search fee, [he]\n\ntherefore has not exhausted his administrative remedies”); Research Air, Inc. v. Kempthorne, 589\n\nF. Supp. 2d 1, 10 & n.6 (D.D.C. 2008) (agency properly refused to process a FOIA request\n\nwhere the requester rejected the notion that he would be required to pay a fee and agency\n\n“demanded only that [plaintiff] either narrow his request in order to reduce their estimated costs\n\nor commit to future payment for the costs incurred by [the agency] in processing the search\n\nrequest”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\f                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that DoD’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment is GRANTED.

Civil Action No. 12-cv-1754 (RLW)\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,\n\n                     Defendant.\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Plaintiff Kathryn Sack, a University of Virginia graduate student, brings this Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) challenge against the Department of Defense (“DoD”), vis-à-vis its\n\ncomponent agencies, the Defense Intelligence Agency (“DIA”) and the National Security\n\nAgency (“NSA”). Through her remaining claims, Sack argues that DIA failed to adequately\n\nsearch for records responsive to her FOIA requests and that it improperly withheld documents\n\nunder FOIA’s statutory exemptions. Additionally, Sack complains that NSA failed to categorize\n\nher as an “educational institution” requester and wrongly failed to provide her with two free\n\nhours of search time. The matter is presently before the Court on the Department’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 22). Finding that DIA’s search methods were sound, and that\n\nDIA appropriately relied upon Exemption 7(E) to withhold the contested documents from\n\nrelease, the Court concludes that Sack’s claims involving DIA lack merit. With respect to NSA,\n\nhowever, the Court agrees that NSA should have classified Sack as an “educational institution”\n\nrequester, which means the Court need not reach the parties’ arguments surrounding the two\n\nhours of free search time. Accordingly, having carefully considered the parties’ briefing, the\n\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\fentire record in this action, and the governing authorities and precedents, the Court concludes for\n\nthe reasons that follow, that the Department’s Motion will be GRANTED.\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n    A. Factual Background\n\n       Plaintiff Kathryn Sack (“Sack”) is a University of Virginia graduate student preparing her\n\ndissertation on the issue of polygraph bias. 1 (Compl. at ¶ 4). To gather more information in\n\nconnection with her research, Sack filed eleven different FOIA requests with DIA and NSA, all\n\nof which generally sought information concerning the agencies’ polygraph programs. Although\n\nSack’s Complaint asserts thirteen (13) separate counts, the scope of her claims has narrowed\n\nconsiderably during the pendency of this action.       For purposes of this Opinion, the Court\n\nsummarizes only the salient facts bearing on the claims that remain in dispute. 2\n\n\n           1. Count II: DIA Request No. 0193-2011\n\n       On February 14, 2011, Sack filed three FOIA requests with DIA, only one of which\n\nremains at issue. Through that request, which Sack pursues through Count II of her Complaint,\n\nshe sought “[a]ll records maintained by [DIA’s] security office representing aggregate data of\n\npolygraph examinations.” (Dkt. No. 22-1 (“Williams Decl.”) at ¶ 10, Ex. 3). DIA originally\n\nresponded to Sack about one week later, on February 22, 2011, assigning her inquiry Request\n\nNo. 0193-2011. (Id. ¶ 11, Ex. 4). Inexplicably, Sack’s request then sat dormant for quite some\n\n\n\n\n1\n       In the Complaint, the plaintiff is identified as “Kathryn Sack.” Most of the documents\nfound elsewhere in the record, though, refer to a “Katelyn Sack.” This incongruity is never\nexplained by the parties, but the Court presumes that both names refer to the plaintiff here.\n2\n      For simplicity’s sake, the Court summarizes Sack’s claims in the sequence they appear in\nthe Complaint, recognizing that, in some cases, the facts do not proceed chronologically.\n                                                 2\n\ftime until April 2012, when DIA eventually tasked the National Center for Credibility\n\nAssessment (“NCCA”) to search for responsive records. (Id. ¶ 12). 3\n\n       While Sack’s request expressly sought records only from DIA’s Office of Security, DIA\n\ndetermined that responsive information was most likely to be located within NCCA, rather than\n\nthe Office of Security. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 8). In turn, NCCA searched its electronic records systems for\n\ninformation responsive to the request, using its “ProCite Database” and the NCCA shared\n\ncomputer electronic storage drive; NCCA also searched its paper filing system. (Id. ¶ 12). For\n\nits electronic search, NCCA used keywords it thought calibrated to locate any potentially\n\nresponsive records, including “bias,” “gender,” “race,” “age,” and “sexual orientation.” (Id.).\n\nMoreover, though DIA did not reasonably expect any results, DIA also asked the Office of\n\nSecurity to review its records, but the Office of Security confirmed that it does not maintain any\n\naggregate data responsive to Sack’s request. (Id.). Ultimately, neither NCCA nor the Office of\n\nSecurity located any records responsive to this particular request.\n\n\n             2. Counts V and VI: NSA Request Nos. 64010 and 64011\n\n       Sack also submitted three FOIA requests to NSA on or around February 14, 2011. Two\n\nof these requests—pled through Counts V and VI of her Complaint—remain in dispute. Therein,\n\nSack sought records representing aggregate data of polygraph examinations and records\n\npertaining to equal employment opportunity rules and polygraphs, respectively. (See Compl. at\n\n¶¶ 32-43).     Sack also sought classification as an “academic” or “educational institution”\n\n\n3\n        DIA explains—and Sack does not dispute—that NCCA “serves as the government’s\npremiere educational center for polygraph and other credibility assessment technologies and\ntechniques. Its central mission is to assist federal agencies in the protection of U.S. citizens,\ninterests, infrastructure and security by providing the best education and tools for credibility\nassessment and to manage the Quality Assurance Program that develops, implements, and\nprovides oversight of psychophysiological detection of deception (PDD) standards for the federal\npolygraph programs.” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 6).\n                                                 3\n\frequester, which would have exempted her from the search-related costs associated with her\n\nrequest. (See Dkt. No. 22-3 (“Janosek Decl.”) at Ex. 1). NSA acknowledged receipt of Sack’s\n\nrequests on March 10, 2011, assigning them case numbers 64010 and 64011. (Id., Ex. 2).\n\nThrough this same response, NSA stated that Sack could not be classified as an “academic”\n\nrequester, explaining that she did not meet the criteria for “educational institution” as defined in\n\nthe Code of Federal Regulations; more specifically, NSA did not believe Sack’s request was\n\nmade on behalf of the University of Virginia. (Id. ¶ 9, Ex. 2). 4 Instead, NSA classified Sack as\n\nan “all other” requester, which meant that under DoD regulations, Sack was obligated to pay for\n\nsearch time in excess of two hours. (Id. at Ex. 2). Based on its initial assessment, NSA\n\nestimated that the applicable search costs (not including the two free hours of search time) would\n\namount to approximately $880.00. (Id. ¶ 14, Ex. 2). NSA explained that Sack would be required\n\nto remit one-half of the total cost estimate ($440.00) before NSA would commence its search\n\nefforts.\n\n           Rather than doing so, Sack appealed this determination in May 2012. (Id. ¶ 16, Ex. 3).\n\nAs part of that appeal, Sack attached a letter from the University of Virginia’s Director of\n\nGraduate Studies, Professor Jeffrey Jenkins, stating that Sack’s objectives were “consistent with\n\n[the University’s] scholarly research goals” and confirming that Sack was “acting as a\n\nrepresentative of the University of Virginia’s Department of Politics.” (Id., Ex. 3). The NSA\n\nFOIA Appeal Authority denied Sack’s appeal by letter dated January 17, 2013. (Id. ¶ 17, Ex. 4).\n\nNSA found Mr. Jenkins’ letter insufficient because it confirmed that Sack was “a Ph.D. student\n\nand President’s Fellow rather than a member of the faculty,” and because it did not come from\n\n\n\n4\n       Sack also sought a “public interest” fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), which\nNSA denied in this same response. While part of her original claims in this case, Sack no longer\nchallenges NSA’s determination on the “public interest” waiver. (See Pl’s Opp’n at 2).\n                                                 4\n\fthe Department’s Chair. (Id.). NSA also found significant that Sack’s counsel was representing\n\nonly Sack individually, and not the University of Virginia or its Department of Politics. (Id.).\n\nThus, Sack remained classified as an “all other” requester, with NSA requiring that Sack remit a\n\nportion of the estimated search costs before it would process her requests.\n\n\n           3. Count IX: DIA Request No. 0069-2010\n\n       On October 23, 2009, Sack filed a FOIA request with DIA seeking Department of\n\nDefense Polygraph Institute (“DoDPI”) and Defense Academy of Credibility Assessment\n\n(“DACA”) records that would reflect polygraph examination bias research and studies.\n\n(Williams Decl. at ¶ 9, Ex. 8).5 Although DIA acknowledged receipt on December 18, 2009, as\n\nwith Sack’s other requests, it seems DIA did not take any further action for some time. (Id. ¶\n\n17). Eventually, in or around April 2012, DIA conducted a search for records within NCCA,\n\nboth within its paper filing system and its electronic records. (Id. ¶ 18). For purposes of the\n\nelectronic review, NCCA again searched its ProCite Database and the NCCA shared computer\n\nelectronic storage drive, using the keywords “bias,” “gender,” “race,” “age,” and “sexual\n\norientation.” (Id.). Through its search efforts, DIA located three documents (totaling 42 pages)\n\nthat were responsive to Sack’s request; all three documents were released in full, and are\n\nsummarized in DIA’s Vaughn index at entries V-8, V-9, and V-10. (Id.; see also Dkt. No. 22-2\n\n(“DIA Vaughn Index”)).\n\n\n           4. Counts XI and XII: DIA Request Nos. 0041-2012 and 0059-2012\n\n       Sack separately filed two FOIA requests with the Federal Investigative Services Division\n\n(“FIS”) of the Office of Personnel Management. The first of these requests, submitted on July 5,\n\n2011, sought records about polygraphers and polygraph examinations. (See Compl. at ¶ 67-68).\n\n5\n       DoDPI and DACA are predecessors to the NCCA. (Williams Decl. at ¶ 6).\n                                                5\n\fThe second request was filed on October 14, 2011, and sought “records pertaining to periodic\n\nreviews of agencies’ polygraph programs.” (Id. ¶ 74). With respect to the first request, FIS\n\nreferred two records to DIA for direct response: a Quality Assurance Program Inspection Report,\n\nand a Polygraph Memorandum of Agreement.            (Williams Decl. at ¶ 22).     Invoking FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, and 7(E), DIA withheld the Quality Assurance Program Inspection Report in\n\nfull, and though it produced the Polygraph Memorandum of Agreement, DIA redacted portions\n\nof the document pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3 and 6. (Id. ¶ 23, Ex. 11; Vaughn Index). Sack\n\nwas notified of this determination by letter dated March 5, 2013. (Williams Decl. at Ex. 11). As\n\nfor the second request, FIS referred another seven records to DIA for direct response, all of\n\nwhich consisted of additional Quality Assurance Program Inspection Reports. (Williams Decl. at\n\n¶ 24; Vaughn Index). DIA withheld all seven documents from production, pursuant to FOIA\n\nExemptions 3, 6, and 7(E). (Id.).\n\n\n           5. Count XIII: DIA Request No. 0135-2011\n\n       Sack submitted a separate FOIA request to DIA on December 23, 2010, seeking all\n\ncorrespondence dating back to 2002 between DIA employees and Sheila Reed, who the parties\n\ndescribe as “a well-known polygraph researcher.” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 25, Ex. 12). After\n\nconfirming receipt of this request by letter dated January 5, 2011, it appears DIA did not pursue\n\nSack’s request any further for some time. (Id. ¶ 26). Eventually, NCCA conducted a search for\n\npotentially responsive materials, within both its paper files and its electronic records. (Id.). As\n\nsearch terms, DIA utilized “Sheila Reed” and “Reed, Sheila,” searching its ProCite Database and\n\nthe NCCA share computer electronic storage drive. (Id.). No responsive records were located as\n\na result of NCCA’s search, and DIA advised Sack of these results by letter on January 23, 2013.\n\n(Id. ¶¶ 27-28, Ex. 13).\n\n\n                                                6\n\f    B. Procedural History\n\n       Sack filed her thirteen-count complaint initiating this FOIA action against DoD on\n\nOctober 30, 2012. 6 Since then, Sack has withdrawn or abandoned several claims. Through the\n\nJoint Status Report, Sack voluntarily dismissed Count III on January 18, 2013. (See Dkt. No. 12\n\nat ¶ 1(3)). The parties then proceeded with a stipulated summary judgment briefing schedule.\n\nThe Department filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on March 22, 2013, (Dkt. No. 22\n\n(“Def.’s MSJ”)), and through her opposition brief, filed on April 22, 2013, Sack expressly\n\nwithdrew her claims under Counts I, IV, and VIII, (see Dkt. No. 23 (“Pl.’s Opp’n”) at 2-3).\n\nFinally, the Department advised the Court through its reply brief that Sack has withdrawn her\n\nclaims under Count X. (See Dkt. No. 28-2). At this juncture, then, only Counts II, V, VI, VII,\n\nIX, XI, XII, and XIII remain in dispute.\n\n       In support of its motion, DoD submitted several declarations describing DIA’s and\n\nNSA’s response efforts to Sack’s FOIA requests. As to DIA, the Court received the declaration\n\nof Alesia Williams, Chief of the FOIA Services Section within the FOIA and Declassification\n\nServices Branch for the DIA. (See Williams Decl.). In addition, Ms. Williams submitted a\n\nsupplemental declaration along with the Department’s reply.      (See Dkt. No. 28-1 (“Supp.\n\nWilliams Decl.”)).   The Department also filed a detailed Vaughn index, describing DIA’s\n\nwithholdings and redactions under FOIA’s statutory exemptions. (See Vaughn Index). With\n\n\n\n\n6\n        Originally, Sack’s claims were part of a larger lawsuit. Along with DoD, that lawsuit\ninvolved FOIA claims against the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Justice, the\nOffice of Personnel Management, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. On the\ndefendants’ motion, the Court severed Sack’s claims and ordered Sack to refile those counts\nrelating to DoD through a separate action. Two related FOIA actions remain pending before the\nundersigned—Sack v. Central Intelligence Agency (12-cv-537) and Sack v. U.S. Department of\nJustice (12-cv-1755)—but the claims in those matters will be resolved separately and are not\notherwise addressed in this Memorandum Opinion.\n                                              7\n\frespect to NSA, the Court received the declaration of Diane Janosek, Deputy Associate Director\n\nfor Policy and Records for the NSA.” (See Janosek Decl.). 7\n\n       DoD’s Motion for Summary Judgment is now fully briefed and ripe for decision.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n       Through her remaining claims, Sack challenges DIA’s and NSA’s compliance with their\n\nFOIA obligations in several respects. First, through Counts II, IX, and XIII, Sack asserts that\n\nDIA failed to perform an adequate search in response to her requests. Second, Sack insists that\n\nDIA improperly invoked FOIA Exemption 7(E) to fully withhold records responsive the FOIA\n\nrequests described in Counts XI and XII. Third, Sack complains that NSA wrongly denied her\n\nrequest to be classified as an “educational institution” requester, treating her as an “all other”\n\nrequester instead. And fourth, Sack argues that NSA improperly failed to provide her with two\n\nfree hours of search time, as “all other” requesters are entitled to receive. After summarizing the\n\noverall legal principles governing its analysis, the Court addresses each issue in turn.\n\n\n    A.

The Adequacy Of DIA’s Searches\n\n           1. Count II\n\n       Count II concerns Sack’s request for information from DIA’s Office of Security\n\n“representing aggregate data of polygraph examinations.” (See Compl. at ¶ 14). As set forth\n\nabove, DIA’s ensuing search for records yielded no results. Displeased with this result, Sack\n\nnow contests the adequacy of DIA’s search efforts on several fronts. First, Sack complains that\n\nDIA too narrowly interpreted her request as limited to “bias-related” records, when the request\n\nsought aggregate polygraph data generally and had “nothing to do with bias.” (Pl.’s Opp’n at 7).\n\nSecond, Sack assails DIA for listing only some of the terms used during its search, rather than all\n\nof the terms, arguing that this showing cannot satisfy DIA’s obligation to demonstrate an\n\nadequate search. Third, Sack contends that DIA wrongly focused its search on polygraph\n\nexaminers, rather than polygraph examinations, as the request sought.\n\n       The Court can quickly dispense with the latter two arguments. Both contentions spring\n\nfrom the content of Ms. Williams’ original declaration in this case. Therein, Ms. Williams\n\nattested that NCCA conducted its electronic search using “keywords, such as ‘bias,’ ‘gender,’\n\n‘race,’ ‘age,’ and ‘sexual orientation.’” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 12) (emphasis added). She also\n\naverred that “the Office of Security reported that the office does not maintain any aggregate data\n\nconcerning polygraph examiners.” (Id.) (emphasis added). Sack seizes upon these statements in\n\ninsisting that DIA has not satisfied its FOIA obligations—both because the agency failed to\n\ndelineate the full contours of its review (providing an illustrative, rather than exhaustive, list of\n\nsearch terms), and because it searched for the wrong records (i.e., data regarding polygraph\n\nexaminers, rather than polygraph examinations). Whatever weight these arguments might carry\n\nin another case, Ms. Williams’ supplemental declaration neutralizes their impact here. Ms.\n\nWilliams confirmed that despite her inclusion of the phrase “such as” in her original declaration,\n                                                 11\n\fthe search terms she listed consisted of the entire universe of terms used during DIA’s electronic\n\nreview of NCCA records. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 5). Additionally, Ms. Williams explained\n\nthat her reference to “polygraph examiners” was simply a typographical error; she confirmed that\n\nDIA actually interpreted Sack’s request as seeking “aggregate data of polygraph examinations,”\n\nand she confirmed with the Office of Security and NCCA that the offices interpreted Sack’s\n\nrequest the same and searched accordingly. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 6-7). In view of these clarifications,\n\nSack’s arguments on these points are unavailing.\n\n       Sack’s remaining argument—that DIA inappropriately narrowed her request as seeking\n\nonly bias-related information—merits some further discussion. But ultimately, this theory too\n\nfails to persuade. According to Sack, her request was broadly-phrased, calling for all aggregate\n\ndata regarding polygraph examinations. And because DIA limited its electronic search of NCCA\n\nrecords to bias-related keywords, Sack insists that this search cannot be deemed adequate. For\n\nits part, DIA rejoins that after consulting with NCCA leadership, it was determined that a search\n\nusing the term “aggregate data” would not yield any results. Instead, DIA and NCCA leadership\n\ndetermined that “searching for information related to bias or unfairness was most likely to locate\n\nrecords responsive to plaintiff’s request.” (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 5). In the Court’s view,\n\nboth sides overlook a critical issue in pressing these arguments—the specific scope of Sack’s\n\nFOIA request. Sack’s request was explicitly limited to records maintain by DIA’s “security\n\noffice,” (Williams Decl., Ex. 2), which means that the parties’ debate surrounding DIA’s search\n\nof NCCA records—as compared with records maintained by the Office of Security, as Sack\n\nactually requested—largely misses the mark.\n\n       As our Circuit has repeatedly recognized, “adequacy is measured by the reasonableness\n\nof the effort in light of the specific request.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 869 (quoting Meeropol v.\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fMeese, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469998\"><a href=\"/opinion/469998/michael-meeropol-aka-rosenberg-v-edwin-meese-iii-attorney-general-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). This means that an agency “is not obliged to look\n\nbeyond the four corners of the request for leads to the location of responsive documents.”\n\nKowalczyk v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710866\"><a href=\"/opinion/710866/chester-kowalczyk-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Here, the four corners of\n\nSack’s request clearly limited the scope of records she was seeking to records maintained by the\n\nOffice of Security, not the NCCA. And though Sack summarily complains that DIA fails to\n\ndescribe its search efforts in relation to the Office of Security altogether, the Court disagrees.\n\n        Ms. Williams avers that DIA consulted with “senior leaders” in the Office of Security,\n\nand that those leaders confirmed the Office of Security does not maintain aggregate data; instead\n\nits records systems are limited to “the individual personal polygraph examination reports of the\n\nmany DIA and DoD employees who have been required to submit to a polygraph examination.”\n\n(Supp. Williams Decl. ¶ 7). In addition, “[t]he Office of Security leadership confirmed that it has\n\nnot endeavored to develop aggregate data from these individual files or reports.” (Id.). The\n\nCourt finds that this explanation—derived from DIA’s consultation with senior officials familiar\n\nwith the Office of Security’s records—demonstrates that DIA appropriately approached Sack’s\n\nrequest and that a more detailed search on the Office of Security’s part would have been “futile\n\nand . . . unnecessary.” American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. v.

And in carrying\n\nout that aspect of its search, it was equally reasonable for DIA to rely upon the bias- and EEO-\n\nrelated search terms it used. As noted, DIA determined, in consultation with NCCA officials,\n\nthat a search for “aggregate data” would have been fruitless. In turn, the agency interpreted the\n\nscope of Sack’s request in a manner consistent with the scope of Sack’s accompanying FOIA\n\nrequests to DIA, all of which sought bias- and EEO-related information related to polygraphs.\n\n(See Williams Decl., Exs. 1, 5). Under the totality of the circumstances, this was an appropriate\n\napproach. See Rein v. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1027758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1027758/rein-v-us-patent-trademark-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (4th Cir. 2009)\n\n(concluding that agency’s “decision to use the searches conducted in response to [prior, similar]\n\nrequests as the starting point for responding to [current] requests was not inherently unreasonable\n\nand appears to be a practical and common-sense approach,” since “[t]he requests sought similar\n\ninformation related to the same subject matter”).\n\n       In sum, the Court concludes that DIA met its FOIA obligations to conduct a reasonable\n\nand adequate search for potentially responsive records as to Count II of the Complaint.\n\n\n           2. Count IX\n\n       Through Count IX, Sack challenges DIA’s response to her request for studies pertaining\n\nto polygraph bias. While DIA produced three responsive records, detailed at entries V-8, V-9,\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fand V10 of DIA’s Vaughn index, Sack nevertheless contests the adequacy of DIA’s search\n\nefforts. In so doing, Sack presses two familiar arguments. Neither is persuasive.\n\n       First, Sack assails Ms. Williams’ use of the phrase “such as” in introducing the search\n\nterms used by NCCA. The Court rejects this argument for the reasons already stated; as with\n\nCount II, Ms. Williams subsequently confirmed that the search terms listed were the only terms\n\nused by DIA in carrying out this search. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 8). Second, Sack again\n\ncomplains about DIA’s failure to provide specific information concerning the nature of the\n\nsearch performed within the Office of Security. But again, Sack is wrong. As before, Ms.\n\nWilliams attests that through discussions with Office of Security leadership, DIA determined that\n\nit was “highly unlikely that [responsive] records would be located” within the office, insofar as\n\nthe Office of Security maintains only individual employee polygraph reports, and not research or\n\nstudies about polygraph biases. (Id. ¶¶ 7-8). This explanation sufficiently establishes that a\n\nmore detailed search was unnecessary and would have been futile.       See American-Arab Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Comm., 516 F. Supp. 2d at 88; Amnesty Int’l, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2519908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11.\n\nMoreover, despite the unlikelihood that responsive records would be found in the Office of\n\nSecurity, the record establishes that the Office of Security searched its electronic files anyway,\n\nusing the same keywords as NCCA—keywords with which Sack does not take issue for purposes\n\nof this particular request. (Williams Decl. at ¶ 18; Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶¶ 8-9). Despite\n\nthese efforts, DIA did not uncover any responsive records. Simply put, DIA’s search efforts in\n\nresponse to this request comported with its obligations under FOIA, and none of Sack’s\n\narguments establishes otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f           3. Count XIII\n\n      Sack next takes issue with DIA’s response to her request for correspondence between DIA\n\nemployees and Sheila Reed, as pled through Count XIII. In so arguing, Sack mounts two\n\nseparate challenges to the adequacy of DIA’s search. First, Sack argues that DIA wrongly\n\nconfined its search efforts to NCCA, when it should have reviewed records held by other\n\ncomponents of DIA, particularly the Office of Security. Second, Sack argues that even DIA’s\n\nsearch within NCCA fell short, insofar as DIA inappropriately neglected to review NCCA’s\n\nemail systems for potentially responsive documents. Neither theory is availing.\n\n      To begin with, the record establishes that DIA’s focus on NCCA’s records systems, as\n\nopposed to documents with the Office of Security, was reasonable and appropriate. As set forth\n\nin Ms. Williams’ declaration, DIA consulted directly with leadership from the Office of Security\n\nand ultimately determined that a search of Office of Security records was unlikely to uncover\n\nany responsive records. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 16). According to Ms. Williams, “[t]he\n\nOffice of Security does not conduct polygraph research,” but is instead focused on “conduct[ing]\n\npolygraph examinations based on the guidance provided by the NCCA.” (Id.). She further avers\n\nthat none of the leadership staff members are personally acquainted with Ms. Reed, such that\n\nthey would be likely to possess responsive email messages; indeed, the Office of Security\n\nleadership confirmed that they have not had any communication with Ms. Reed. (Id.). Based on\n\nthis assessment, the Court agrees that an additional search of the Office of Security’s records was\n\nunnecessary. See American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 516 F. Supp. 2d at 88; Amnesty\n\nInt’l, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">25119908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11. To the contrary, based on NCCA’s mission of assisting\n\nfederal agencies with education and tools for credibility assessment, it was appropriate for DIA\n\nto conclude that any responsive records were likely to be found within NCCA, and to focus its\n\nsearch efforts accordingly. See Lechliter, 182 F. App’x at 115-16; Citizens for Responsibility &\n                                                16\n\fEthics in Wash., 822 F. Supp. 2d at 19. At bottom, Sack is effectively arguing that responsive\n\ndocuments might exist elsewhere within DIA, but she offers nothing beyond her own supposition\n\nin support of this theory. This approach simply comes up short. See, e.g., Hodge v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“As we have said before, mere speculation that as yet uncovered\n\ndocuments may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency conducted a reasonable\n\nsearch.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      As for Sack’s second argument, it is now effectively moot. Ms. Williams confirms that\n\nDIA has since undertaken a supplemental search of NCCA’s email systems and archives for\n\npotentially responsive records, using Ms. Reed’s first and last name as search terms in the “to”\n\nand “from” fields of messages. (Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 15). These additional search efforts\n\ndid not yield any responsive records. Accordingly, the Court concludes that DIA discharged its\n\nFOIA obligations with respect to Sack’s claim under Count XIII.\n\n\n    C. DIA’s Withholdings: FOIA Exemption 7(E)\n\n       Along with her claims surrounding DIA’s search efforts, Sack also insists that DIA\n\nimproperly withheld responsive documents under FOIA’s statutory exemptions. In particular,\n\nSack contends that DIA wrongly invoked Exemption 7(E) to withhold the various Quality\n\nAssurance Program Inspection Reports (“QAP Reports”) that were uncovered during DIA’s\n\nsearch. (See Vaughn Index, V-1, V-2, V-3, V-4, V-5, V-6, V-7, V-11). 9\n\n       “Exemption 7(E) shields information if ‘disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk\n\ncircumvention of the law.’” Mayer Brown LLP v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187345\"><a href=\"/opinion/187345/mayer-brown-llp-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E)). In this Circuit, “Exemption 7(E) sets a relatively low bar for\n\n9\n       Although DIA redacted portions of these same documents (and others) pursuant to FOIA\nExemptions 3, 6, and 7(C), Sack does not challenge the propriety of these withholdings. (See\nPl.’s Opp’n at 11). Instead, Sack strictly takes issue with DIA’s reliance on Exemption 7(E) to\nwithhold the entirety of the above-referenced documents in full.\n                                                17\n\fthe agency to justify withholding: ‘Rather than requiring a highly specific burden of showing\n\nhow the law will be circumvented, exemption 7(E) only requires that the [agency] demonstrate\n\nlogically how the release of the requested information might create a risk of circumvention of the\n\nlaw.’” Blackwell v. FBI, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"220173\"><a href=\"/opinion/220173/blackwell-v-fbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Mayer Brown LLP, 562 F.3d\n\nat 1194) (alteration in original). With respect to the QAP Reports at issue, DIA maintains that\n\n“disclosure of this particular information could diminish the effectiveness of polygraph\n\nexamination as an investigative tool.” (Williams Decl. at ¶ 25). As DIA explains things, “the\n\nrole of the NCCA in examining the polygraph programs of other agencies”—and, in turn, in\n\ncreating these QAP Reports—“was to identify the potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that\n\nmay allow bad actors to fool that agency and conduct illegal activities without detection.” (Id. ¶\n\n26). According to DIA, then, “[i]f this information [were] disclosed to the general public, . . . a\n\ndetermined bad actor could identify agencies with greater polygraph program vulnerabilities”\n\nthat “could then be exploited.” (Id.). The Court agrees that this explanation satisfies Exemption\n\n7(E)’s standards to justify DIA’s withholdings.\n\n       None of Sack’s arguments to the contrary compel a different outcome. Sack first seeks to\n\ndistinguish between polygraph examinations conducted as part of a criminal investigation, on the\n\none hand, and employment-related polygraph programs, on the other. In her view, while the\n\nrelease of information concerning polygraph examinations of criminal suspects could jeopardize\n\npublic safety and risk the subversion of law—thus justifying the withholding of “all polygraph\n\ninformation,” (see Pl.’s Opp’n at 14) —details surrounding the employment-screening polygraph\n\nprocesses used by federal agencies pose no such risk. While the Court recognizes that there are\n\ncertainly some distinctions between the two scenarios, neither the case law nor common sense\n\nsupports the hard line in the sand Sack seeks to draw. True, much of the precedent supporting the\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fwithholding of polygraph information under Exemption 7(E) arises in the criminal investigatory\n\ncontext. See, e.g., Piper v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570019\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570019/piper-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (D.D.C. 2003)\n\n(collecting cases).   But the D.C. Circuit’s precedents make clear that the application of\n\nExemption 7(E) should not be so narrowly cabined. As DIA rightly observes, our Court of\n\nAppeals has upheld the invocation of Exemption 7(E) to withhold information that could\n\nreasonably be expected to allow insight into the CIA’s clearance and investigatory processes\n\nused during the background investigations of its officers. See Morley v. CIA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187057\"><a href=\"/opinion/187057/morley-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“It is self-evident that information revealing security clearance\n\nprocedures could render those procedures vulnerable and weaken their effectiveness at\n\nuncovering background information on potential candidates.”). Cf. Tax Analysts v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778068\"><a href=\"/opinion/778068/tax-analysts-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“An agency may seek to block the disclosure of internal agency\n\nmaterials relating to guidelines, techniques, sources, and procedures for law enforcement\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions, even when the materials have not been compiled in the course of\n\na specific investigation.”). The Circuit’s reasoning in Morley applies with equal force here.\n\n       Disclosure of the QAP Reports could reasonably be expected to circumvent the efficacy\n\nof background investigations undertaken by federal agencies.         Indeed, these concerns are\n\nparticularly heightened in this case, given that the QAP Reports in contention pertain to the\n\npolygraph screening programs of federal law enforcement agencies—the United States Secret\n\nService; the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\n\nFirearms, and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration. (See Vaughn Index V-1,\n\nV-2, V-3, V-4, V-5, V-6, V-7, V-11). The Court agrees that placing this information in the\n\npublic domain at least creates a risk that bad actors could leverage those details to subvert the\n\nbackground screening process, thereby gaining access to sensitive (if not classified) information\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fthat could be exploited to harm national security and homeland security interests. The Court thus\n\nrejects Sack’s contention that because the QAP Reports relate to employment-based polygraph\n\nprograms, their disclosure does not implicate the sort of risks that would justify the invocation of\n\nExemption 7(E).\n\n       Second, Sack asserts that even though some of the information in the QAP reports may\n\nbe properly exempt from disclosure, DIA failed to satisfy its segregability obligations to release\n\ninformation that, at least in Sack’s mind, poses no risk of circumvention of the law. More\n\nspecifically, Sack does not dispute that the sections of the QAP Reports “describing uncorrected\n\nvulnerabilities in agencies’ polygraph programs is properly exempt” under Exemption 7(E).\n\n(Pl.’s Opp’n at 11) (emphasis in original); (Id. at 14) (“Sack concedes that information which\n\nwould highlight current vulnerabilities in intelligence and law enforcement agencies’\n\nemployment screening polygraph programs would be properly exempt.”) (emphasis in original).\n\nInstead, Sack takes issue with DIA’s withholding of those aspects of the QAP Reports pertaining\n\nto vulnerabilities that “have been fixed or did not exist in the first place.” (Id.). In the Court’s\n\nview, this is a distinction without a meaningful difference. Forcing DIA to release details\n\nconcerning the efficacy of polygraph programs used by federal law enforcement agencies—\n\nwhether related to vulnerabilities, strengths, or otherwise—implicates the threats and dangers\n\noutlined above, creating at least a risk that subversive individuals will be armed with advanced\n\nknowledge of the procedures used by the United States to screen applicants for sensitive\n\nemployment positions and security clearances. In short, Sack’s efforts to cast various aspects of\n\nthe withheld QAP Reports outside of Exemption 7(E)’s reach are simply unpersuasive.\n\n       Finally, Sack assails DIA for assertedly misrepresenting that the QAP Reports were\n\nvoluntarily created at the request of agencies, when the QAP Reports were mandated under\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fOffice of Personnel Management policy. Sack suggests that these circumstances undermine the\n\npropriety of DIA’s withholdings. For its part, DIA disclaims any intent to “leave the impression\n\nthat a law enforcement agency pursues this type of inspection without any requirement to do so.”\n\n(Supp. Williams Decl. at ¶ 13). Either way, this argument is much ado about nothing. Whether\n\nthe QAP Reports are created in connection with mandatory or voluntary inspections, the end\n\nresult is the same: the content of these documents summarizes the polygraph programs of federal\n\nlaw enforcement agencies, and for the reasons stated, the release of that information “could\n\nreasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.” Mayer Brown LLP, 562 F.3d at 1192.\n\n       In sum, the Court agrees that DIA has met its burden to demonstrate that the QAP\n\nReports uncovered during its search were properly withheld under Exemption 7(E).\n\n\n   D. Sack’s Request That NSA Classify Her As An “Educational Institution” Requester\n\n       Unlike her claims against DIA, Sack’s remaining claims against NSA do not stem from\n\nan allegedly inadequate search or the invocation of supposedly inapplicable exemptions. Indeed,\n\nwith respect to the specific FOIA requests at issue, NSA did not even undertake a search for\n\npotentially responsive records, and it certainly did not withhold any such records under FOIA’s\n\nstatutory exemptions. Rather, Sack alleges that NSA improperly refused to classify her as an\n\n“educational institution” requester for purposes of FOIA’s fee provisions.\n\n       Under FOIA, fees assessed in connection with a request generally include “reasonable\n\nstandard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records are requested for\n\ncommercial use.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). That said, “[t]he fees required by FOIA are\n\nreduced for certain categories of requesters.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580440\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580440/judicial-watch-inc-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (D.D.C. 2000).        As relevant here, “when records are not sought for\n\ncommercial use and the request is made by an educational . . . institution,” the statute provides\n\n\n                                               21\n\fthat “fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication.” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). In other words, when records are sought by an “educational institution”—as\n\nthat term is interpreted in the FOIA context—the requester is not assessed fees for time spent\n\nsearching for and reviewing potentially responsive records; the requester is responsible solely for\n\nduplication costs. See Nat’l Sec. Archive v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526958\"><a href=\"/opinion/526958/national-security-archive-v-us-department-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1382-83 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1989) (“In such cases, an agency may impose upon the requester only the cost of duplicating\n\nthe records it releases.”).

With this framework in mind, the Court turns to the question at hand.\n\n       Sack maintains that as a representative of the University of Virginia’s Department of\n\nPolitical Science—and, more specifically, as a University representative seeking information in\n\nfurtherance of the Department’s scholarly research goals—she should have been classified under\n\nthe “educational institution” fee category. For its part, NSA rejoins that the information put\n\nforward by Sack was insufficient to establish that she was acting on behalf of the University or\n\nthe Department at the time she submitted her FOIA requests, rather than pursuing her own\n\nindividual research goals.     While both sides mount credible arguments in support of their\n\npositions, on balance, the Court agrees with NSA that Sack failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nto justify her classification as an “educational institution” requester.\n\n       The Court notes at the outset that there is a dearth of authority concerning this particular\n\nquestion. As a starting point, DoD regulations define the term “educational institution” as:\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f       [A] pre-school, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution\n       of graduate high education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an\n       institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education,\n       which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.\n\n32 C.F.R. § 286.28(e)(4). Further, the OMB fee guidelines—to which agency regulations must\n\nconform, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i)—make clear that the “educational institution” category\n\nextends to representatives acting on behalf of the institution, as long as the request “serves a\n\nscholarly research goal of the institution.” OMB Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee\n\nSchedule and Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. 10,012, 10,014 (Mar. 27, 1987); see also 132 Cong. Rec.\n\nS14298 (Sept. 30, 1986) (remarks of Sen. Leahy) (“A request made by a professor or other\n\nmember of the professional staff of an educational . . . institution should be presumed to have\n\nbeen made by the institution.”). The OMB fee guidelines elaborate on this concept with some\n\nconcrete examples, explaining that:\n\n       [A] request from a professor of geology at a State university for records relating\n       to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, could be\n       presumed to be from an educational institution. A request from the same person\n       for drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a\n       murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional\n       request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationary.\n                                *              *              *\n       The institutional versus individual test would apply to student requests as well. A\n       student who makes a request in furtherance of the completion of a course of\n       instruction is carrying out an individual research goal and the request would not\n       qualify . . . .\n\n52 Fed. Reg. at 10,014. As explained in the Justice Department FOIA Guide, “[t]o qualify for\n\ninclusion in this fee subcategory, the request must serve a scholarly research goal of the\n\ninstitution, not an individual goal. Thus, a student seeking inclusion in this subcategory, who\n\n‘makes a request in furtherance of the completion of a course of instruction is carrying out an\n\nindividual research goal,’ and would not qualify as an educational institution requester.” U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice, Guide to the Freedom of Information Act, p. 102 (2009) (emphasis\n\n                                               23\n\fadded) (citing the OMB fee guidelines). As one commentator recently conceded (plaintively),\n\nthe OMB fee guidelines confirm that individual research projects serve a “training” function for\n\nthe student and do not meet the FOIA educational institutional exemption. Pall, The High Costs\n\nof Costs: Fees as Barriers to Access Within the United States and Canadian Freedom of\n\nInformation Regimes, 7 Cardozo Pub. L. Pol'y & Ethics J. 599, 622 (2009). The wisdom of this\n\nstatutory and regulatory scheme is not before the Court, only its application to the record.\n\n       Under this framework, the Court finds that Sack did not sufficiently establish she was\n\nacting on behalf of the University’s Department of Politics through her requests, or that she was\n\nseeking the requested information in furtherance of the University’s scholarly goals.          As an\n\ninitial matter, Sack’s original proffer to the NSA—essentially consisting of her own, conclusory\n\nassertion that her requests fell under the “educational institution” category, (see Janosek Decl.,\n\nEx. 1)—was plainly inadequate. On appeal, Sack supplied NSA with a letter—written on\n\nUniversity of Virginia letterhead and signed by the Director of Graduate Studies in the\n\nDepartment of Politics, Professor Jeffrey Jenkins—which stated that Sack’s research objectives\n\nwere “consistent with U. Va.’s scholarly research goals,” that Sack’s requests were submitted\n\n“on behalf of [the] institution,” and that Sack was “acting as a representative of the University of\n\nVirginia’s Department of Politics.” (Id., Ex. 3). In NSA’s view, this proffer still fell short, and\n\nthe agency concluded that Mr. Jenkins’ contention that Sack was representing the Department of\n\nPolitics was “not supportable.” (Id., Ex. 4). While it is a close question, the Court agrees.\n\nProfessor Jenkins’ letter was wholly conclusory – while he asserted that Sack’s request was “on\n\nbehalf of the institution,” he did not specify that the request was being used to support a research\n\nproject being carried out by him, any other professor, or any department of the university.\n\nInstead, his letter parroted the language from Sack’s original request, which was that she\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f“intend[ed] to review, evaluate, synthesize, and present the requested data, analyses, policies,\n\nprotocols, and practices in a publically available, usable form,” adding that “[t]his intention is\n\nconsistent with U. Va.’s scholarly research goals.”         (Id., Ex. 3).   Sack’s original request\n\nidentified her as a Ph.D. student preforming research, and NSA was entitled to conclude that her\n\nrequest furthered an “individual research goal” associated with completing a course of her\n\ngraduate studies or her dissertation. Professor Jenkins’ letter could have made clear that Sack’s\n\nresearch was for something other than fulfilling her course requirements, but it conspicuously\n\nfailed to do so.\n\n        In sum, all of Sack’s submissions contained vague and conclusory wording that evaded\n\nthe central question presented by the OMB fee guidelines: whether the request was for Sack’s\n\ncoursework, or whether it was for a project sponsored by the educational institution. Sack, as the\n\nrequester, had the burden of proof on this issue, and her proof was simply insufficient. To hold\n\notherwise would allow a student’s FOIA request supporting her coursework to fall within the\n\neducational institution exemption, so long as the request does not mention her coursework and so\n\nlong as an instructor asserts (without explanation) that the request is “on behalf of the institution”\n\nand that the student’s research is “consistent” with the goals of the institution. This would be an\n\nend-run around the OMB fee guidelines. Accordingly, the Court holds that NSA did not err by\n\nrefusing to classify Sack as an “educational institution” requester for purposes of FOIA Requests\n\n64010 and 64011. 10\n\n\n\n\n10\n        The Court pauses to emphasize the narrow scope of its holding. In the future, Sack or\nany other student requester can qualify for “educational institution” classification under FOIA by\nsupplying the agency with confirmation—on institutional letterhead, and written by an\nappropriate official—that the research underlying the student’s request is not in furtherance of\nthe student’s coursework and is made on behalf of the institution and in furtherance of research\nsponsored by the institution.\n                                                 25\n\f       Finally, the Court need not tarry long on Sack’s alternative challenge to NSA’s policies\n\nsurrounding two free search hours. Plaintiff does not dispute that she refused to either pay fees\n\nor commit to making any payment on the requests at issue. NSA’s requirement that Plaintiff\n\nremit payment in the amount of $440.00, which is one-half of the total amount of the estimated\n\ncosts, minus the free search time, (Id., Ex. 2), is in accordance with its regulations, 32 C.F.R. §\n\n286.28(e)(2)(i)(B), which unambiguously state that “a search for responsive records will not be\n\ninitiated until the requester indicates a willingness to pay assessable costs appropriate for the\n\ncategory determined by the Component.”         See Janosek Decl. ¶ 25. Nothing in the FOIA\n\nprecludes an agency from first requiring that the payment and scope of a request be clear before\n\nany search is conducted. See Chaplin v.
