HUPPENTHAL                       3\n\nfacts alleged by them were insufficient to justify the\nmaintenance of a statewide injunction. The panel concluded\nthe plaintiffs were not attacking the validity of a statewide\npolicy; rather, they were challenging local implementation\nafter the first year of a four-hour English Language\nDevelopment requirement, and its alleged negative effects on\nEnglish Language Learner students, some of whom might\nreceive less academic content than their English-speaking\npeers. The panel held that plaintiffs did not demonstrate\nstanding to raise statewide claims.\n\n    Judge Friedland concurred in Parts I.1-I.4 of the majority\nopinion, which addressed the motion for relief from\njudgment, and she concurred in the judgment. Judge\nFriedland agreed with the majority that the district court\nobeyed the Supreme Court’s directives regarding how the\nremand in this case should proceed, and that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in, accordingly, granting Rule\n60(b)(5) relief to defendants. Judge Friedland wrote\nseparately to address additional arguments she understood\nplaintiffs to be making. Judge Friedland would hold that\nalthough plaintiffs had standing to bring a facial challenge to\nthe four-hour English Language Development model adopted\nfor use statewide, this challenge failed on the merits. She\nalso would hold that plaintiffs did not show that their new\nobjections to the four-four model’s implementation in\nNogales constituted EEOA violations that required\nmaintaining an injunction in Nogales.\n\f4                FLORES V.

SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Plaintiffs-Appellants are a class of English Language\nLearners (ELLs) and their parents (the Flores Plaintiffs) in\nNogales Unified School District (Nogales). They appeal from\nthe district court’s order granting the Superintendent of\nPublic Instruction for the State of Arizona, the State of\nArizona, the Arizona State Board of Education, the Speaker\nof the Arizona House of Representatives, and the President of\nthe Arizona Senate (collectively, the State Defendants) Rule\n60(b)(5) relief from a judgment for alleged violations of the\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act (EEOA), 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1701–21. The district court also vacated its earlier\ninjunction granting the Flores Plaintiffs statewide relief\nbecause it determined that the Flores Plaintiffs had not\nestablished a “statewide” violation of the EEOA. In arriving\nat its decisions, the district court followed the instructions of\nthe Supreme Court in Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433 (2009).\n\n    On appeal, the Flores Plaintiffs argue that the district\ncourt erred because, 1) the four-hour English language\nrequirement imposed on ELLs violates the EEOA because “it\nresults in ELL students receiving less academic content than\ntheir English-speaking peers and the State neither provides,\nnor requires school districts to provide, ELL students with an\nopportunity to recover that missed content,” and it segregates\nELL students from their English-speaking peers “[if] the goal\nof proficiency within one year has not been achieved”; and\n2) the Flores Plaintiffs “have standing to challenge a State-\nmandated policy intended to bring about a uniform method of\nEnglish language instruction to all ELL students in all\ndistricts in Arizona.”\n\f6                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\n    We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin granting the State Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion for\nrelief from judgment because the circumstances surrounding\nthe implementation and funding of ELL programs at the state\nand national levels have changed substantially since 2000,\nand the current programs constitute “appropriate action”\nunder the EEOA. We further hold that the Flores Plaintiffs\nhave not shown that Arizona is violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis, and that the facts alleged by them are\ninsufficient to justify the maintenance of a statewide\ninjunction.\n\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    In 1992, the Flores Plaintiffs filed a class action suit on\nbehalf of “all minority ‘at risk’ and limited English proficient\nchildren . . . now or hereafter, enrolled in the Nogales Unified\nSchool District . . . as well as their parents and guardians.”\nHorne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 439–40 (2009). The Flores\nPlaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment holding the State\nof Arizona, the Arizona State Board of Education, and the\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction responsible for violating\nthe EEOA, which provides in relevant part:\n\n       No state shall deny equal educational\n       opportunity to an individual on account of his\n       or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by–\n\n       ...\n\f                       FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                                 7\n\n         (f) the failure by an educational agency to take\n         appropriate action to overcome language\n         barriers that impede equal participation by its\n         students in its instructional programs.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1703 (emphasis added).\n\n    In 2000, after a bench trial, the district court concluded\nthat the State Defendants1 were violating the EEOA by\nproviding insufficient funding to ELL students in Nogales.\nFlores v. State of Arizona, 172 F. Supp. 2d 1225 (D. Ariz.\n2000). Later that year, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203,\nwhich implemented the “sheltered English immersion” (SEI)\napproach statewide, and required “nearly all classroom\ninstruction” to be “in English but with the curriculum and\npresentation designed for children who are learning the\nlanguage.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 15-751(5).\n\n    In 2001, just days after Congress passed the No Child\nLeft Behind Act (NCLB), 115 Stat. 1702, as added, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 6842 et seq., the district court extended its original\ndeclaratory judgment statewide, “even though the certified\nclass included only Nogales students and parents and even\nthough the court did not find that any districts other than\nNogales were in violation of the EEOA.” Horne, 557 U.S. at\n441; No. CIV 92-596TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, at *2 (D.\nAriz. June 25, 2001). The state attorney general acquiesced in\nthis statewide extension because of “the Arizona\n\n\n  1\n    We note that plaintiffs originally sought relief against only “the State\nof Arizona, its Board of Education, and its Superintendent of Public\nInstruction.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 441. The Speaker for the State House of\nRepresentatives and the President of the State Senate intervened in the suit\nas representatives of their respective legislative bodies in 2006. Id. at 443.\n\f8                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nconstitutional requirement of uniform statewide school\nfunding.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 442. In 2005, the district court\nheld the State in contempt for failing to “appropriately and\nconstitutionally fun[d] the state’s ELL programs,” and\ncommanded the Arizona legislature (which at the time was\nnot a party to the suit) to allocate more funds to ELL\ninstruction, or be faced with contempt sanctions totaling\nmillions of dollars per day. Id. at 441–42 (alteration in\noriginal) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n    In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines,\nthe Arizona legislature passed House Bill 2064 (HB 2064),\n“which was designed to implement a permanent funding\nsolution to the problems identified by the District Court order\nin 2000.” Id. at 442. HB 2064 increased ELL incremental\nfunding for ELL students, and created two new funds “to\ncover additional costs of ELL programming.” Id. at 442–43.\nHB 2064 also established the Arizona English Language\nLearners Task Force (Task Force), which was charged with\ndeveloping and adopting research-based models for ELL\ninstruction using the structured English immersion approach.\nThe statute directed the Task Force to “identify the minimum\namount of English language development [ELD] per day for\nall models,” but specified that “the task force shall develop\nseparate models for the first year in which a pupil is classified\nas an English language learner that includes a minimum of\nfour hours per day of English language development.” A.R.S.\n§ 15-756.01(C) (2006).\n\n    Shortly thereafter, the legislature intervened in the\nongoing litigation to defend its interests, and requested an\nevidentiary hearing on a motion for Rule 60(b)(5) relief from\njudgment in light of the passage of HB 2064. Horne, 557 U.S.\nat 443. The district court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\n\f                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      9\n\nfinding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed (and inadequate) in\nits allocation of ELL funding for three reasons: the increase\nin funding “was not rationally related to effective ELL\nprogramming”; the bill imposed an “irrational” two-year limit\non funding for each ELL student; and HB 2064 “violated\nfederal law by using federal funds to ‘supplant’ rather than\n‘supplement’ state funds.” Id. at 443–44.\n\n    Our court vacated the district court’s order, and remanded\nfor an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief was warranted. Id. at 444. The district court again\ndenied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion. We affirmed the order on\nappeal because petitioners had not shown “either that there\nare no longer incremental costs associated with ELL\nprograms in Arizona,” or that Arizona’s “educational funding\nmodel was so altered that focusing on ELL-specific\nincremental costs funding has become irrelevant and\ninequitable.” Flores v. Arizona, 516 F.3d 1140, 1169 (9th Cir.\n2008).\n\n    The Supreme Court reversed. It observed that the decision\nhad not addressed the “critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry” of “whether the objective of the District Court’s\n2000 declaratory judgment order—i.e., satisfaction of the\nEEOA’s ‘appropriate action’ standard—has been achieved.”\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 450. Instead, “the Court of Appeals used\na heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to\nfederalism concerns” by concerning itself “only with\ndetermining whether increased ELL funding complied with\nthe original declaratory judgment order.” Id. at 451. In other\nwords, “the Court of Appeals framed a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry\nthat was too narrow—one that focused almost exclusively on\nthe sufficiency of incremental funding,” instead of\n“ascertain[ing] whether ongoing enforcement of the original\n\f10                 FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\norder was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law\n(here, the EEOA).” Id. at 452, 454.\n\n    The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court\nwith detailed instructions “for a proper examination of at least\nfour important factual and legal changes that may warrant the\ngranting of relief from the judgment: the State’s adoption of\na new ELL instructional methodology, Congress’ enactment\nof NCLB, structural and management reforms in Nogales,\nand increased overall education funding.” Id. at 459. Finally,\nthe Court noted that “[t]he record contains no factual findings\nor evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed\n(much less continues to fail) to provide equal educational\nopportunities to ELL students,” and questioned whether “the\nDistrict Court had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction\nwhen it is not apparent that plaintiffs—a class of Nogales\nstudents and their parents—had standing to seek such relief.”\nId. at 470–71. Accordingly, the Court instructed the district\ncourt to “vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond\nNogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violating\nthe EEOA on a statewide basis.” Id. at 472.\n\n    On remand, the Flores Plaintiffs elected not to file a\nmotion to expand the class. The district court held a three-\nweek evidentiary hearing on the State Defendants’ Rule\n60(b)(5) motion, and allowed the Flores Plaintiffs to present\nevidence of a statewide EEOA violation. The Flores Plaintiffs\nargued that the State’s “adoption of models requiring that\nELL students be segregated for more than a year in four hours\nof daily English language development class . . . is not\n‘appropriate action’ under the EEOA” because segregation\n\f                      FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                               11\n\nprevents ELL students from “acquir[ing] the academic credits\nnecessary to graduate from high school within four years.”2\n\n    After examining the four factors the Supreme Court\nidentified as relevant to deciding the State Defendants’ Rule\n60(b)(5) motion, the district court granted the motion with\nrespect to Nogales because “[e]normous changes have\noccurred in the method by which Arizona delivers English\nlanguage instruction since judgment was entered in this case\nin 2000,” including the advent of NCLB, the development of\nthe State’s general academic test known as the Arizona\nInstrument to Measure Standards (AIMS), and the\nimplementation of an English proficiency test used to classify\npupils as ELL students. The district court also observed that\n“the state has seen the election of a new Governor, a new\nSuperintendent of Schools, and a new Attorney General,” as\nwell as numerous changes in the membership of the Arizona\nlegislature. The district court concluded that the Flores\nPlaintiffs’ “evidence from a few school districts” regarding\nimplementation of the four-hour model was “not sufficient to\nestablish standing to bring a statewide claim.” In addition,\n“Plaintiffs’ newly asserted claims are not ‘statewide’ in\nnature, but rather depend on specific implementation choices\nmade at a district level, thus requiring a district-by-district\nanalysis.” Accordingly, the district court dismissed the\nstatewide claims.\n\n     The Flores Plaintiffs filed this appeal.\n\n\n\n 2\n   The Flores Plaintiffs originally alleged three statewide violations of the\nEEOA, including the manner in which ELL students are identified, and\nhow the students’ English proficiency is tested, but decided only to pursue\nthe “implementation of the Four Hour Model across the state” on appeal.\n\f12                    FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review\nfor abuse of discretion the district court’s decision granting\nthe State Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion for relief from\njudgment. United States v. Asarco, Inc., 430 F.3d 972, 978\n(9th Cir. 2005). We review the district court’s conclusions on\nquestions of standing de novo. Ellis v. City of Mesa, 990 F.2d\n1518, 1523 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n\n    The Supreme Court in Horne gave the district court\ndetailed guidance for reviewing the State Defendants’ motion\nfor relief from judgment on remand. 557 U.S. 433, 447–72\n(2009). We conclude that the district court complied with the\nSupreme Court’s order, and that relief from judgment was\nproperly granted.\n\n                                     I.\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs contend that Rule 60(b)(5) relief\nfrom judgment was not warranted because the state law that\nmandates public school policies and practices for ELLs\nthroughout the State of Arizona continues to violate the\nEEOA.3 They do not contest the district court’s findings of\nfact. Instead, they find it “inexplicabl[e]” that the court\n\n\n 3\n   The district court expressly “limit[ed] its review of the 60(b)(5) motion\nto Nogales” because it found that the “implementation decisions vary from\ndistrict to district,” and that “plaintiffs have not established any\n‘statewide’ violation.” Accordingly, we also limit our review of the district\ncourt’s ruling on the State Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) challenge to\nNogales.\n\f                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      13\n\n“concluded that the Task Force models, with their four hour\nELD requirement, did not violate the EEOA.” We consider\nthe Flores Plaintiffs’ arguments in turn.\n\n    Rule 60(b)(5) permits a court to relieve a party from final\njudgment if “the judgment has been satisfied, released, or\ndischarged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been\nreversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer\nequitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). A court abuses its\ndiscretion when it refuses to modify an injunction or consent\ndecree in light of “a significant change either in factual\nconditions or in law” that “renders continued enforcement\ndetrimental to the public interest.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 447\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The abuse-\nof-discretion standard is,\n\n       highly deferential to the trial court. Under this\n       standard of review, we cannot simply\n       substitute our judgment for that of the district\n       court, but must be left with the definite and\n       firm conviction that the court committed a\n       clear error of judgment in reaching its\n       conclusion after weighing the relevant factors.\n\nUnited States v. Roston, 986 F.2d 1287, 1291 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     The Supreme Court admonished the district court for\nfailing to engage in the proper analysis when it denied the\nState Defendants’ initial Rule 60(b)(5) motion, “ask[ing] only\nwhether petitioners had satisfied the original declaratory\njudgment order through increased incremental funding,”\nthereby “disregard[ing] the remand instructions to engage in\na broad and flexible Rule 60(b)(5) analysis as to whether\n\f14                 FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nchanged circumstances warranted relief.” Horne, 557 U.S. at\n456–57. It also criticized our court for affirming the district\ncourt’s order, and “improperly substitut[ing] its own\neducational and budgetary policy judgments for those of the\nstate and local officials to whom such decisions are properly\nentrusted.” Id. at 455. In other words, the “critical question in\nthis Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the\nDistrict Court’s 2000 declaratory judgment order—i.e.,\nsatisfaction of the EEOA’s ‘appropriate action’ standard—has\nbeen achieved.” Id. at 450.\n\n     As we have previously stated, “[b]ecause Section 1703(f)\nwas proposed as an amendment from the floor of the House,\nthere is very little legislative history” to shed light on “the\nscope of the ‘appropriate action’ requirement” in the EEOA.\nGuadalupe Org. Inc. v. Tempe Elementary School Dist.,\n587 F.2d 1022, 1030 (9th Cir. 1978). “The interpretation of\nfloor amendments unaccompanied by illuminating debate\nshould adhere closely to the ordinary meaning of the\namendment’s language.” Id.; see also Castaneda v. Pickard,\n648 F.2d 989, 1001 (5th Cir. 1981). The Supreme Court has\ninstructed that the ordinary meaning of “appropriate action”\nrequires a State to “(1) formulate a sound English language\ninstruction educational plan; (2) implement that plan; and\n(3) achieve adequate results.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 459, n.8\n(citing Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009–10). Determining\nwhether the State is taking “appropriate action,” and whether\nrelief from judgment is therefore warranted, requires attention\nto “federalism concerns,” which are “heightened when, as in\nthese cases, a federal court decree has the effect of dictating\nstate or local budget priorities.” Id. at 448.\n\n    In this case, “the lower courts . . . misperceived both the\nnature of the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the\n\f                    FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                         15\n\nbreadth of the inquiry called for under Rule 60(b)(5).” Horne,\n557 U.S. at 459. To avoid further confusion, the Supreme\nCourt gave careful guidance concerning each of the four\nfactors that could warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief on remand, and\nthe district court made numerous factual findings concerning\neach of those factors.\n\n1. The State’s Adoption of New ELL Instructional\n   Methodology\n\n    The Supreme Court directed the district court to consider\nthe State’s adoption of a new ELL instructional methodology,\nwhich the Court noted appears “significantly more effective\nthan bilingual education . . . . In light of this, a proper analysis\nof petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should include further\nfactual findings regarding whether Nogales’ implementation\nof SEI methodology—completed in all of its schools by\n2005—constitutes a ‘significantly changed circumstance’ that\nwarrants relief.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 461.\n\n    In response, the district court considered a number of\ndevelopments concerning the first factor. It found that in\n2000, Arizona voters approved Proposition 203, A.R.S.\n§§ 15-751–15-755, which changed the primary method of\nELD in Arizona from a bilingual education model to SEI.\nProposition 203 established a one-year goal for ELLs to\nbecome proficient, and required annual testing and\nmonitoring of the ELL program. A.R.S. §§ 15-752, 15-755.\nThe shift from bilingual education to the SEI methodology\nrequired that all ELL students be placed in English language\nclassrooms and taught only in English. A.R.S. § 15-752.\n\n   Proposition 203 initially left the implementation of the\nSEI model to the individual school districts, but in 2006, the\n\f16                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nArizona legislature passed HB 2064. A.R.S. §§ 15-756–15-\n756.13. HB 2064 established an ELL Task Force charged\nwith developing a research-based model of ELL instruction\nin SEI methodologies, including a minimum of four hours of\ndaily instruction in ELD for the first year, with the Task\nForce to determine the number of hours in each year\nthereafter (A.R.S. § 15-756.01); it delegated the duty of\nidentifying ELLs to the Superintendent of Public Instruction\n(A.R.S. § 15-756); it required that the models be research-\nbased, with consideration paid to the size, location, grade\nlevels, and number of ELLs at the school (A.R.S. § 15-\n756.01); it required all school districts to adopt the Task\nForce’s model, or submit an alternative model for approval\n(A.R.S. § 15-756.02(B)); it mandated a uniform method of\nassessing and reclassifying ELL students, and for monitoring\nreclassified students two years after exiting the program\n(A.R.S. § 15-756.06); it required at least annual testing of\nELLs to determine whether they should be re-classified as\n“English proficient” (A.R.S. § 15-756.05(A), (B)); it created\nthe Office of English Language Acquisition Services, which\nwas to monitor the school districts’ implementation of and\ncompliance with the models (A.R.S. § 15-756.07); and it\nrequired the Task Force to refine the models yearly, as\nnecessary (A.R.S. § 15-756.01).\n\n    The Task Force met thirty-one times between September\n2006 and September 2007, accepted drafts of proposed\nmodels, consulted experts, and held public hearings before\nchoosing a model. The Task Force model groups students by\nproficiency, and for four hours each day, requires content that\n“emphasizes the English language itself” rather than “other\ntypes of instruction, e.g. math, science, or social science.”\nHowever, “[a]cademic content can be used as a vehicle for\ndelivering ELD . . . .” As the district court observed, “[t]he\n\f                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                       17\n\nextent to which ELL students in the four hours of ELD are\nexposed to academic content can vary from school district to\nschool district and from school to school within a school\ndistrict” because “[t]he state does not prescribe the kind of\nacademic content that should be used as a vehicle for\ndelivering English Language Development at various grade\nlevels and the teachers have the flexibility to use the materials\nthat they want.”\n\n2. Congress’s Enactment of No Child Left Behind\n\n    The Supreme Court also instructed the district court to\nconsider whether the enactment of NCLB “constitute[s] a\nsignificantly changed circumstance, warranting relief.”\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 465. It noted that the “original declaratory\njudgment order,” which “withdr[e]w[] the authority of state\nand local officials to fund and implement ELL programs that\nbest suit Nogales’ needs . . . conflict[s] with Congress’\ndetermination of federal policy.” Id. The Court found the\nenactment of NCLB “probative in four principal ways”: (1)\nit prompted the State to institute significant structural and\nprogramming changes in its delivery of ELL education; (2) it\nsignificantly increased federal funding for education in\ngeneral and ELL programming in particular; (3) through its\nassessment and reporting requirements, it provides evidence\nof the progress and achievement of Nogales’ ELL students;\nand (4) it makes a shift in federal education policy. Id. at\n463–64.\n\n    The district court undertook its analysis of this factor as\ndirected by the Supreme Court. It concluded that NCLB “has\nmade four major changes to the delivery of ELD in Nogales\nand throughout Arizona: (A) the development of the ELP\n[English Language Performance standards], (B) the adoption\n\f18                 FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nof Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives (“AMAOs”),\n(C) accountability for failure to achieve AMAOs, and\n(D) increased funding.” The district court noted that, “In\n2009, Nogales met its Annual Yearly Progress (AYP)\nrequirements as required by NCLB by reclassifying more\nthan 15% of its ELL students.” In addition, NCLB “devises\nan elaborate accountability structure for a district’s failure to\nachieve AMAOs, including the requirement of corrective\naction, NCLB § 1116(b)(7), and sanctions starting at\ndecreased funding and culminating in a takeover of failing\nschools. NCLB § 1116(b)(8).”\n\n3. Structural and Management Reforms in Nogales\n\n    As to the third change—structural and management\nreforms in Nogales—the Supreme Court made clear that it\nwas “error” for “both courts [to] refuse[] to consider that\nNogales could be taking ‘appropriate action’ to address\nlanguage barriers even without having satisfied the original\norder” through, for example, Nogales superintendent “[Kelt]\nCooper’s structural, curricular, and accountability-based\nreforms.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 466–67. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court found that “[b]eginning with Superintendent\nCooper and continuing with Superintendent McCollough,\nNogales has implemented substantial structural and\nmanagement reforms that have significantly elevated its\nperformance.” Nogales’ teacher salaries are now “competitive\nwithin Arizona, and very competitive within its region,” and\nit is “no longer the case” that Nogales has “inadequate\nteaching materials for both content and ESL classes.”\nNogales “created a centralized textbook adoption program,\nwhich addressed the Court’s concerns regarding the adequacy\nof teaching materials,” and “established various\n\f                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      19\n\ncompensatory education programs including summer school\nand after-school tutoring.”\n\n4. Increased Overall Education Funding\n\n    Finally, the district court turned to the issue of funding,\nthe factor that lay at the heart of its earlier orders holding\nArizona in violation of the EEOA. The Supreme Court noted\nthat the “five sources of funding that collectively financed\neducation in the State” at the time the original declaratory\njudgment was entered “have notably increased since 2000,”\nand constitute “[a] fourth potentially important change . . . in\nNogales.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 468. On remand, the district\ncourt acknowledged the “several income streams” by which\nArizona funds local education, and carefully examined the\nfunding changes statewide, and in Nogales. Statewide\nequalization funding (intended to make sure all districts are\non a level playing field) increased from $3.413 billion in\n2000 to $5.776 billion in 2010. As a result of NCLB,\nArizona’s share of Title I funding increased from\n$359,247,997 in 2000 to $582,931,537 in 2010. The 2009\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act “sent about one\nand a half billion dollars in FY 2010 for education purposes”\n“[f]or Arizona alone.” In 2000, Nogales voters approved a\nbudget override, “and the funds it has generated have\nincreased from $895,891 in FY 2001 to $1,750,825 in FY\n2010.” Funding per pupil in Nogales increased by 44% over\nthe past decade, from $3,675 in 2000 to $5,306 in 2010. The\ncourt concluded that “Nogales has an effective ELD program.\nIts FEP-2s [students who have reclassified as proficient for\ntwo years] rank higher on AIMs reading, writing, and\nmathematics at all elementary and middle grades,” and “[i]ts\nreclassification rates consistently have placed at the top or\nnear the top of nine sister districts at the border.”\n\f20                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\n    We conclude that the district court carefully followed the\nSupreme Court’s instructions on remand, and did not abuse\nits discretion in determining that in light of the changed\ncircumstances in Nogales and in the State over the course of\nmore than a decade, Rule 60(b)(5) relief was warranted.\n\n                              II.\n\n    We turn now to the question of whether the Flores\nPlaintiffs have alleged a statewide violation of the EEOA.\nOur conclusion that Rule 60(b)(5) relief was properly granted\nbecause the State Defendants’ ELL programs in Nogales\nconstitute “appropriate action” under the EEOA prefigures\nour conclusion that Arizona is not violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis. As the State Defendants observe, the\nexpansion of the injunction statewide “was made solely as a\nmeans (disagreed with by the Supreme Court) of affording\neffective relief in [Nogales]. Thus, with [Nogales]’s\nshortcomings having been fixed, and with it now conducting\nan effective ELD program, the rationale for granting\nstatewide relief collapses.” Nevertheless, because the\nSupreme Court instructed the district court, if “press[ed],” to\ndetermine whether “Arizona is violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis,” we proceed with an analysis of the Flores\nPlaintiffs’ statewide claims on appeal.\n\n    We note initially that the Flores Plaintiffs represent only\na class of Nogales students and their parents. The class was\nnever certified to extend statewide, and the Flores Plaintiffs\ndeclined to seek an expansion of the class. It appears that the\ndistrict court undertook no standing analysis when it extended\nits injunction to apply statewide. In its discussion of the\ndistrict court’s entry of statewide relief, the Supreme Court\nobserved that\n\f                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      21\n\n       [t]he record contains no factual findings or\n       evidence that any school district other than\n       Nogales failed (much less continues to fail) to\n       provide equal educational opportunities to\n       ELL students. . . . Nor have respondents\n       explained how the EEOA could justify a\n       statewide injunction when the only violation\n       claimed or proven was limited to a single\n       school district. See [Missouri v.] Jenkins,\n       515 U.S.[ 70,] 89–90 [(1995)], 115 S. Ct.\n       2038; Milliken [v. Bradley], 433 U.S.[ 267,]\n       280 [(1977)], 97 S. Ct. 2749. It is not even\n       clear that the District Court had jurisdiction to\n       issue a statewide injunction when it is not\n       apparent that plaintiffs—a class of Nogales\n       students and their parents—had standing to\n       seek such relief.\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 470–71. Accordingly, “[a]ssuming that\npetitioners, on remand, press their objection to the statewide\nextension of the remedy, the District Court should vacate the\ninjunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales unless the\ncourt concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis.” Id. at 472.\n\n    On remand, the district court permitted the Flores\nPlaintiffs to present evidence of a statewide violation of the\nEEOA that would justify the continued enforcement of the\nstatewide remedy. The district court concluded that,\n“Plaintiffs’ newly asserted claims are not ‘statewide’ in\nnature, but rather depend on specific implementation choices\nmade at the district level.” We hold that the district court\nproperly dismissed the Flores Plaintiffs’s statewide claims\nbecause the Flores Plaintiffs are not attacking the validity of\n\f22                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\na statewide policy; rather, they are challenging local\nimplementation after the first year of the four-hour English\nlanguage requirement, and its alleged negative effects on ELL\nstudents, some of whom may receive less academic content\nthan their English-speaking peers.4\n\n      In Jenkins, the Court made clear that, “[T]he nature of the\n. . . remedy is to be determined by the nature and scope of the\n. . . violation.” Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 89 (alteration in original);\nsee also Horne, 557 U.S. at 470–71. “The proper response to\nan intradistrict violation is an intradistrict remedy . . . .”\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 90. “[O]nly if there has been a\nsystemwide impact may there be a systemwide remedy,”\nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 359–60 (1996) (quoting\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979) (alteration in\noriginal)). In other words, in order to seek statewide relief on\nbehalf of all ELL students in Arizona, the Flores Plaintiffs\nmust demonstrate “widespread actual injury,” not just\n“isolated instances of actual injury,” as a result of Arizona’s\nalleged violation of the EEOA. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 349.\nThis requirement “derives ultimately from the doctrine of\nstanding, a constitutional principle that prevents courts of law\nfrom undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches.” Id.\nat 349. Article III standing requires, (1) that the plaintiff have\nsuffered a concrete and particularized “injury in fact,” which\nis neither speculative nor conjectural; (2) that there be a\ncausal connection between the injury alleged and the\n\n 4\n   The Flores Plaintiffs are not making a separate claim that the model’s\nsegregation of ELL students violates the Fourteenth Amendment. In fact,\nthe Flores Plaintiffs disclaim this theory. Instead, they argue that\nsegregating students after the first year violates the EEOA because it\ndenies them access to the same academic content as their non-ELL peers.\nThis claim is therefore an alternative argument for why Arizona’s four-\nhour ELD model violates the EEOA.\n\f                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      23\n\nchallenged conduct; and (3) that it “be ‘likely,’ as opposed to\nmerely ‘speculative,’ that the injury will be ‘redressed by a\nfavorable decision.’” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n555, 560–61 (1992). And when plaintiffs seek a systemwide\ninjunction for widespread wrongs, they must demonstrate that\nthe expansive scope of the injunction sought is no broader\nthan necessary to remedy the “inadequacy that produced the\ninjury in fact that the plaintiff has established.” Casey,\n518 U.S. at 357. This is because\n\n       standing is not dispensed in gross. If the right\n       to complain of one administrative deficiency\n       automatically conferred the right to complain\n       of all administrative deficiencies, any citizen\n       aggrieved in one respect could bring the\n       whole structure of state administration before\n       the courts for review. That is of course not the\n       law.\n\nLewis, 518 U.S. at 358 n.6 (1996).\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs argue that they have standing to raise\nstatewide claims because of “the inevitability of the statewide\nimpact that any ruling on the Plaintiffs’ claims, favorable or\nunfavorable, will have.” However, the possible effects of a\nspeculative, future court-ordered remedy are insufficient to\nconfer standing on the Flores Plaintiffs to bring their\nstatewide claim in the first instance. See Am. Civil Liberties\nUnion of Nev. v. Lomax, 471 F.3d 1010, 1015 (9th Cir. 2006)\n(“When evaluating whether these three elements are present,\nwe must look at the facts as they exist at the time the\ncomplaint was filed.”) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphasis in original). The Flores Plaintiffs have not\nestablished “widespread actual injury” as a result of\n\f24                 FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nArizona’s alleged violation of the EEOA, Lewis, 518 U.S. at\n349, and therefore, have not “explained how the EEOA could\njustify a statewide injunction,” Horne, 557 U.S. at 470.\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs appear to be challenging the four-\nhour model as facially violating the EEOA because Arizona\ndoes not require districts “to provide ELL students with an\nopportunity to recover missed academic content.” In reality,\nthey are attacking the implementation of the four-hour model,\nand its alleged negative effects on ELL students. Indeed, the\nFlores Plaintiffs admit that they are not challenging the model\nas applied to all ELL students: “Plaintiffs believe that the\nmodels should be given a chance to work for first year\nEnglish language learners as the Legislature prescribed.”\nInstead it is the “[c]ontinued placement of elementary and\nhigh school students in the four hour model after the first year\n[that] constitutes a failure to take ‘appropriate action’ . . . .”\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs’ chief complaint is that the four-hour\nmodel is defective (i.e., does not constitute “appropriate\naction” under the EEOA) because “[t]he state does not\nrequire school districts to provide ELL students with an\nopportunity to recover the academic content that they missed\nwhile they were in the four hour model and makes no effort\nto determine whether ELL students have been deprived of\nacademic content as a result of being placed in four hours of\nELD.” But the EEOA imposes no such requirement on the\nschool districts; it requires only that a State “‘take appropriate\naction to overcome language barriers’ without specifying\nparticular actions that a State must take. . . . Congress\nintended to leave state and local educational authorities a\nsubstantial amount of latitude in choosing the programs and\ntechniques they would use to meet their obligations under the\nEEOA.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 440–41 (quoting Castaneda v.\n\f                      FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                              25\n\nPickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1009 (5th Cir. 1981)); cf. Guadalupe,\n587 F.2d at 1030.\n\n    The record is replete with evidence that underscores the\nextent to which implementation of this model—and more\nspecifically, the academic content that ELL students\nreceive—varies from district to district. For example,\nHumboldt Unified School District incorporates academic\nstandards promulgated by the State into its ELL curriculum,\nand delivers content-based instruction that conforms to those\nstandards. It also provides before-and-after-school programs,\nas well as summer school classes, to deliver academic content\nto ELL students.5 Amphitheater High School in the\nAmphitheater Public School District works with ELL\nstudents to place them in mainstream core classes, like math,\nat the same time that they are learning English in four-hour\nblocks. This district-by-district implementation of a general,\nState-mandated educational framework is consistent with the\nrequirements of the EEOA. Such local variation makes it\nimpossible for the Flores Plaintiffs to establish a widespread,\nhomogeneous injury sufficient to justify statewide injunctive\nrelief.\n\n   The Flores Plaintiffs also contend that “segregation” of\nELL students beyond the first year violates the EEOA\nbecause, by definition, it is not necessary to achieve\n\n   5\n      As the Flores Plaintiffs note, HB 2064 limits “‘compensatory\ninstruction’ outside the regular school day . . . to English language\ninstruction and does not include providing instruction to ELL students in\nacademic content areas that they may have missed as a result of\nparticipating in the Task Force models.” However, this does not change\nthe fact that, as with the standard four hours of ELD instruction during the\nschool day, the amount of core academic content disseminated during\ncompensatory instruction varies by school district.\n\f26                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nArizona’s stated academic goal of proficiency within one\nyear. They frame the injury that stems from this alleged\nviolation as a denial of ELL students’ educational\nopportunities. The argument is therefore duplicative of their\ncontention that the four-hour English language requirement\nviolates the EEOA because it results in ELL students\nreceiving less academic content than their English-speaking\npeers. This injury cannot provide a basis for a statewide\nremedy because the four-hour model is implemented\ndifferently across the State. For example, the model explicitly\nallows ELL students who have achieved an “intermediate”\nlevel of English proficiency and have passed certain tests to\nbe excused from up to two hours per day of ELD instruction.\nA.R.S. § 15-752(A) permits schools and districts to request\napproval of an alternative model, which in the case of\nGlendale Union High School has resulted in a program that\nallows juniors and seniors who are on track to graduate and\nwho meet certain other requirements to be exempted from\none to two hours of ELD instruction.\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs are not arguing that four hours of\nELD instruction violates the EEOA per se, but rather that the\nState is violating the EEOA through proficiency grouping\nafter the first year, and by not also requiring districts “to\nprovide ELL students with an opportunity to recover missed\nacademic content.” These are not statewide claims; instead,\nthey contemplate alleged injuries that result from the\nimplementation of the four-hour model, which varies from\ndistrict to district, and cannot form the basis of claims for\nstatewide injunctive relief.\n\f                   FLORES V.

We conclude that the district court carefully\nfollowed those instructions. It was not an abuse of discretion\nto grant the State Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion because\nchanged circumstances warrant granting the State Defendants\nrelief from judgment. Likewise, the Flores Plaintiffs have not\nalleged a statewide violation of the EEOA that is adequate to\njustify the continued enforcement of a statewide injunction.\n\n   The pending motions are denied as moot. Each party shall\nbear its own costs on appeal.\n\n    AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFRIEDLAND, Circuit Judge, concurring in Parts I.1–I.4 of\nthe majority opinion, and concurring in the judgment:\n\n     I agree with the majority that the district court obeyed the\nSupreme Court’s directives regarding how the remand in this\ncase should proceed, and that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in, accordingly, granting Rule 60(b)(5) relief to\nDefendants. I nevertheless write separately because I\nunderstand Plaintiffs to be making additional arguments not\naddressed by the majority, and I believe their arguments merit\na response. Specifically, I understand Plaintiffs to be arguing\nthat, on its face, the four-hour English Language\nDevelopment (“ELD”) model adopted by the state Task Force\nviolates the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (“EEOA”)\nbecause it requires “segregation” of English Language\nLearners (“ELLs”) for four hours per day even after their first\n\f28                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nyear of ELD instruction. I also understand Plaintiffs to be\narguing that, even if the original statewide injunction is no\nlonger justified, an injunction should remain in place in\nNogales because Nogales’s implementation of the four-hour\nELD model results in loss of academic content and\nunnecessary segregation for ELLs and thus violates the\nEEOA.\n\n    In response to those arguments, I would hold that\nalthough Plaintiffs have standing to bring a facial challenge\nto the four-hour ELD model adopted by the Task Force for\nuse statewide, their challenge fails on the merits. Further, I\nwould hold that Plaintiffs have not shown that their new\nobjections to the four-hour model’s implementation in\nNogales constitute EEOA violations that require maintaining\nan injunction in this case.\n\n                              I.\n\n    Plaintiffs argue that the “four hour ELD requirement\nbeyond the first year violates the EEOA because the degree\nof segregation required by the State is not necessary to\nachieve the State’s academic goal of proficiency in one year.”\nI understand this to be a facial challenge to the statewide\nimposition of the four-hour ELD model.\n\n    In my view, Plaintiffs have standing to bring such a facial\nchallenge.    Plaintiffs have described a concrete and\nparticularized “injury in fact” because they are subject to the\nfour-hour model, and thus to its requirement that they learn\nEnglish in a separate classroom. Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). That injury is caused by\nthe four-hour model, and it is likely that changing the model\nwould lead Nogales to change its ELD program, so the\n\f                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      29\n\ncausation and redressability requirements for standing are\nalso met. See id. at 560–61. That Plaintiffs are all from\nNogales does not prevent them from having standing to\nfacially challenge what is effectively a state law, because the\nstatewide requirement impacts them personally. See Ariz.\nLibertarian Party, Inc. v. Bayless, 351 F.3d 1277, 1280–81\n(9th Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (holding that the plaintiffs had\nstanding to challenge a statewide rule governing primary\nelections, even though primary elections were administered\nat the county level); Burdick v. Takushi, 937 F.2d 415,\n417–18 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that the plaintiff had standing\nto challenge a statewide prohibition on write-in voting that\naffected him personally, even though an “order striking down\nthe prohibition may apply to races in which [he could not]\nvote”).\n\n    On the merits, however, this facial challenge fails. It is\nnot impermissible segregation to group students by language\nability as long as there is a legitimate educational reason for\ndoing so. See Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 998, 1009\n(5th Cir. Unit A June 1981). We owe deference to state\neducational experts’ opinions, including the Task Force\nmembers’ determination here that students learn English best\nwhen taught in a separate classroom. See Horne v. Flores,\n557 U.S. 433, 468 (2009) (“The EEOA’s ‘appropriate action’\nrequirement grants States broad latitude to design, fund, and\nimplement ELL programs that suit local needs and account\nfor local conditions.”); Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 998, 1009\n(recognizing that school districts have discretion to decide\nwhether language ability grouping is appropriate); cf.

It was not unreasonable for the Task Force to\nconclude that separating students by language proficiency for\nup to four hours each day would enable ELLs to develop their\nEnglish language skills most quickly. Indeed, Plaintiffs do\nnot even dispute this general principle. As the majority\nobserves, Plaintiffs admit that they are not challenging the\nfour-hour model as applied to first-year ELLs. Plaintiffs\noffer no support for their proposed distinction between the\nfirst and subsequent years of ELD—either in terms of why\nstudying in a separate classroom becomes less helpful for\nlanguage acquisition after the first year or in terms of why\nthis separation becomes more harmful. Their facial challenge\nto the statewide requirement that ELLs receive English\ninstruction in a separate classroom after the first year is\ntherefore unavailing.\n\n                                   II.\n\n    I understand Plaintiffs to be making the additional\nargument that Nogales’s implementation of the four-hour\nmodel violates the EEOA by providing insufficient access to\nacademic content for ELLs and by separating ELLs from\ntheir mainstream peers more than is necessary to teach them\nEnglish. These arguments differ from Plaintiffs’ original\nclaim in this lawsuit (that Nogales’s inadequate funding of\nELD violated the EEOA), and Plaintiffs’ new arguments are\nnot clearly addressed by the four considerations that the\nSupreme Court articulated in response to the original funding-\nbased claim.1 Horne, 557 U.S. at 459.

HUPPENTHAL                             31\n\nNogales, there is no question that Plaintiffs have standing to\nmake these arguments. On the current record, however, the\nchallenges to the implementation of the four-hour model in\nNogales fail on the merits.\n\n    With regard to ELLs’ access to academic content in\nNogales, the district court found that “Nogales has an\neffective ELD program.” Based on the performance of\nformer ELLs in Nogales, this factual finding was not clearly\nerroneous. Former ELLs who have been classified as\nEnglish-proficient for at least two years (“FEP-2s”) met or\nexceeded state and district averages on AIMS tests in almost\nall subject-grade combinations in 2006–2009—all of the\nyears for which AIMS data are available in the record.\n\n    The district court also appropriately found that Nogales\nprovides substantial support for ELLs and former ELLs to\ncompensate for any diminished exposure to academic content\nresulting from ELD. For example, Nogales offers summer\nschool and after-school tutoring. These programs cover\nacademic subject areas beyond English, including support for\nscience and math. The fact that FEP-2s in Nogales had a high\nschool graduation rate over 90% each year between 2006 and\n2010 also supports the conclusion that ELLs are eventually\nexposed to necessary academic content.\n\n    With regard to their segregation allegations, Plaintiffs\nargue that, pursuant to guidance provided by the Department\nof Education’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), Nogales’s\n\n\nto Nogales’s implementation of the Task Force model. Defendants have\nnot argued that Plaintiffs waived these Nogales-specific arguments by not\npresenting them more distinctly below, or by not raising them earlier in\nthe litigation.\n\f32                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nimplementation of the four-hour model violates the EEOA\nbecause it is not “the least segregative manner” of ELD.\n“Dear Colleague” Letter from U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Civil\nRights Div., and U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights\n22 (Jan. 7, 2015), available at http://www2.ed.gov/about/\noffices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf. The OCR\nletter interprets the EEOA as requiring schools to “avoid\nunnecessary segregation of” ELLs, and opines that a program\nthat separated ELL from non-ELL students “in subjects like\nphysical education, art, and music” or “during activity periods\noutside of classroom instruction” probably would violate this\nrequirement. Id. Assuming that the OCR letter correctly\ninterprets the EEOA, Plaintiffs have not put forward evidence\nshowing that implementation of the four-hour model in\nNogales results in language-ability-based grouping for more\nthan the ELD portion of the day. To the contrary, Defendants\nhave presented evidence that ELLs in Nogales participate in\nextracurricular activities alongside non-ELLs, and that former\nELLs have access to the full academic curriculum.\n\n                          *   *    *\n\n    The record does not contain enough years of ELL\nperformance data after the implementation of the four-hour\nmodel to be certain of the model’s effectiveness at teaching\nEnglish or of its long-term impact on overall academic\nsuccess. The district court appropriately concluded, however,\nthat, based on the evidence that does exist, Plaintiffs could\nnot show their new challenges to the implementation of the\nfour-hour model in Nogales require maintaining an\ninjunction.\n\n    If evidence of an EEOA violation emerges in the future,\na new lawsuit could of course be brought.

The district court\nappropriately concluded that the injunction imposed in this\nlawsuit is no longer justified by Plaintiffs’ original claims,\nand that their new claims fare no better. The district court\ntherefore did not err in vacating the injunction.\n\f",

Id. at 441–42 (alteration in\noriginal) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n    In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines,\nthe Arizona legislature passed House Bill 2064 (HB 2064),\n“which was designed to implement a permanent funding\nsolution to the problems identified by the District Court order\nin 2000.” Id. at 442.

We affirmed the order on\nappeal because petitioners had not shown “either that there\nare no longer incremental costs associated with ELL\nprograms in Arizona,” or that Arizona’s “educational funding\nmodel was so altered that focusing on ELL-specific\nincremental costs funding has become irrelevant and\ninequitable.” Flores v.

Instead, “the Court of Appeals used\na heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to\nfederalism concerns” by concerning itself “only with\ndetermining whether increased ELL funding complied with\nthe original declaratory judgment order.” Id. at 451. In other\nwords, “the Court of Appeals framed a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry\nthat was too narrow—one that focused almost exclusively on\nthe sufficiency of incremental funding,” instead of\n“ascertain[ing] whether ongoing enforcement of the original\n\f10                 FLORES V.

Finally,\nthe Court noted that “[t]he record contains no factual findings\nor evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed\n(much less continues to fail) to provide equal educational\nopportunities to ELL students,” and questioned whether “the\nDistrict Court had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction\nwhen it is not apparent that plaintiffs—a class of Nogales\nstudents and their parents—had standing to seek such relief.”\nId. at 470–71. Accordingly, the Court instructed the district\ncourt to “vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond\nNogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violating\nthe EEOA on a statewide basis.” Id. at 472.\n\n    On remand, the Flores Plaintiffs elected not to file a\nmotion to expand the class.

The district court also observed that\n“the state has seen the election of a new Governor, a new\nSuperintendent of Schools, and a new Attorney General,” as\nwell as numerous changes in the membership of the Arizona\nlegislature. The district court concluded that the Flores\nPlaintiffs’ “evidence from a few school districts” regarding\nimplementation of the four-hour model was “not sufficient to\nestablish standing to bring a statewide claim.” In addition,\n“Plaintiffs’ newly asserted claims are not ‘statewide’ in\nnature, but rather depend on specific implementation choices\nmade at a district level, thus requiring a district-by-district\nanalysis.” Accordingly, the district court dismissed the\nstatewide claims.\n\n     The Flores Plaintiffs filed this appeal.\n\n\n\n 2\n   The Flores Plaintiffs originally alleged three statewide violations of the\nEEOA, including the manner in which ELL students are identified, and\nhow the students’ English proficiency is tested, but decided only to pursue\nthe “implementation of the Four Hour Model across the state” on appeal.\n\f12                    FLORES V.

The Supreme Court has\ninstructed that the ordinary meaning of “appropriate action”\nrequires a State to “(1) formulate a sound English language\ninstruction educational plan; (2) implement that plan; and\n(3) achieve adequate results.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 459, n.8\n(citing Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009–10). Determining\nwhether the State is taking “appropriate action,” and whether\nrelief from judgment is therefore warranted, requires attention\nto “federalism concerns,” which are “heightened when, as in\nthese cases, a federal court decree has the effect of dictating\nstate or local budget priorities.” Id. at 448.\n\n    In this case, “the lower courts . . . misperceived both the\nnature of the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the\n\f                    FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                         15\n\nbreadth of the inquiry called for under Rule 60(b)(5).” Horne,\n557 U.S. at 459. To avoid further confusion, the Supreme\nCourt gave careful guidance concerning each of the four\nfactors that could warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief on remand, and\nthe district court made numerous factual findings concerning\neach of those factors.\n\n1. The State’s Adoption of New ELL Instructional\n   Methodology\n\n    The Supreme Court directed the district court to consider\nthe State’s adoption of a new ELL instructional methodology,\nwhich the Court noted appears “significantly more effective\nthan bilingual education . . . . In light of this, a proper analysis\nof petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should include further\nfactual findings regarding whether Nogales’ implementation\nof SEI methodology—completed in all of its schools by\n2005—constitutes a ‘significantly changed circumstance’ that\nwarrants relief.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 461.\n\n    In response, the district court considered a number of\ndevelopments concerning the first factor. It found that in\n2000, Arizona voters approved Proposition 203, A.R.S.\n§§ 15-751–15-755, which changed the primary method of\nELD in Arizona from a bilingual education model to SEI.\nProposition 203 established a one-year goal for ELLs to\nbecome proficient, and required annual testing and\nmonitoring of the ELL program. A.R.S. §§ 15-752, 15-755.\nThe shift from bilingual education to the SEI methodology\nrequired that all ELL students be placed in English language\nclassrooms and taught only in English. A.R.S. § 15-752.\n\n   Proposition 203 initially left the implementation of the\nSEI model to the individual school districts, but in 2006, the\n\f16                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nArizona legislature passed HB 2064. A.R.S. §§ 15-756–15-\n756.13. HB 2064 established an ELL Task Force charged\nwith developing a research-based model of ELL instruction\nin SEI methodologies, including a minimum of four hours of\ndaily instruction in ELD for the first year, with the Task\nForce to determine the number of hours in each year\nthereafter (A.R.S. § 15-756.01); it delegated the duty of\nidentifying ELLs to the Superintendent of Public Instruction\n(A.R.S. § 15-756); it required that the models be research-\nbased, with consideration paid to the size, location, grade\nlevels, and number of ELLs at the school (A.R.S. § 15-\n756.01); it required all school districts to adopt the Task\nForce’s model, or submit an alternative model for approval\n(A.R.S. § 15-756.02(B)); it mandated a uniform method of\nassessing and reclassifying ELL students, and for monitoring\nreclassified students two years after exiting the program\n(A.R.S. § 15-756.06); it required at least annual testing of\nELLs to determine whether they should be re-classified as\n“English proficient” (A.R.S. § 15-756.05(A), (B)); it created\nthe Office of English Language Acquisition Services, which\nwas to monitor the school districts’ implementation of and\ncompliance with the models (A.R.S. § 15-756.07); and it\nrequired the Task Force to refine the models yearly, as\nnecessary (A.R.S. § 15-756.01).\n\n    The Task Force met thirty-one times between September\n2006 and September 2007, accepted drafts of proposed\nmodels, consulted experts, and held public hearings before\nchoosing a model. The Task Force model groups students by\nproficiency, and for four hours each day, requires content that\n“emphasizes the English language itself” rather than “other\ntypes of instruction, e.g. math, science, or social science.”\nHowever, “[a]cademic content can be used as a vehicle for\ndelivering ELD . . . .” As the district court observed, “[t]he\n\f                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                       17\n\nextent to which ELL students in the four hours of ELD are\nexposed to academic content can vary from school district to\nschool district and from school to school within a school\ndistrict” because “[t]he state does not prescribe the kind of\nacademic content that should be used as a vehicle for\ndelivering English Language Development at various grade\nlevels and the teachers have the flexibility to use the materials\nthat they want.”\n\n2. Congress’s Enactment of No Child Left Behind\n\n    The Supreme Court also instructed the district court to\nconsider whether the enactment of NCLB “constitute[s] a\nsignificantly changed circumstance, warranting relief.”\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 465. It noted that the “original declaratory\njudgment order,” which “withdr[e]w[] the authority of state\nand local officials to fund and implement ELL programs that\nbest suit Nogales’ needs . . . conflict[s] with Congress’\ndetermination of federal policy.” Id. The Court found the\nenactment of NCLB “probative in four principal ways”: (1)\nit prompted the State to institute significant structural and\nprogramming changes in its delivery of ELL education; (2) it\nsignificantly increased federal funding for education in\ngeneral and ELL programming in particular; (3) through its\nassessment and reporting requirements, it provides evidence\nof the progress and achievement of Nogales’ ELL students;\nand (4) it makes a shift in federal education policy. Id. at\n463–64.\n\n    The district court undertook its analysis of this factor as\ndirected by the Supreme Court. It concluded that NCLB “has\nmade four major changes to the delivery of ELD in Nogales\nand throughout Arizona: (A) the development of the ELP\n[English Language Performance standards], (B) the adoption\n\f18                 FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nof Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives (“AMAOs”),\n(C) accountability for failure to achieve AMAOs, and\n(D) increased funding.” The district court noted that, “In\n2009, Nogales met its Annual Yearly Progress (AYP)\nrequirements as required by NCLB by reclassifying more\nthan 15% of its ELL students.” In addition, NCLB “devises\nan elaborate accountability structure for a district’s failure to\nachieve AMAOs, including the requirement of corrective\naction, NCLB § 1116(b)(7), and sanctions starting at\ndecreased funding and culminating in a takeover of failing\nschools. NCLB § 1116(b)(8).”\n\n3. Structural and Management Reforms in Nogales\n\n    As to the third change—structural and management\nreforms in Nogales—the Supreme Court made clear that it\nwas “error” for “both courts [to] refuse[] to consider that\nNogales could be taking ‘appropriate action’ to address\nlanguage barriers even without having satisfied the original\norder” through, for example, Nogales superintendent “[Kelt]\nCooper’s structural, curricular, and accountability-based\nreforms.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 466–67. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court found that “[b]eginning with Superintendent\nCooper and continuing with Superintendent McCollough,\nNogales has implemented substantial structural and\nmanagement reforms that have significantly elevated its\nperformance.” Nogales’ teacher salaries are now “competitive\nwithin Arizona, and very competitive within its region,” and\nit is “no longer the case” that Nogales has “inadequate\nteaching materials for both content and ESL classes.”\nNogales “created a centralized textbook adoption program,\nwhich addressed the Court’s concerns regarding the adequacy\nof teaching materials,” and “established various\n\f                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      19\n\ncompensatory education programs including summer school\nand after-school tutoring.”\n\n4. Increased Overall Education Funding\n\n    Finally, the district court turned to the issue of funding,\nthe factor that lay at the heart of its earlier orders holding\nArizona in violation of the EEOA. The Supreme Court noted\nthat the “five sources of funding that collectively financed\neducation in the State” at the time the original declaratory\njudgment was entered “have notably increased since 2000,”\nand constitute “[a] fourth potentially important change . . . in\nNogales.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 468. On remand, the district\ncourt acknowledged the “several income streams” by which\nArizona funds local education, and carefully examined the\nfunding changes statewide, and in Nogales. Statewide\nequalization funding (intended to make sure all districts are\non a level playing field) increased from $3.413 billion in\n2000 to $5.776 billion in 2010. As a result of NCLB,\nArizona’s share of Title I funding increased from\n$359,247,997 in 2000 to $582,931,537 in 2010. The 2009\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act “sent about one\nand a half billion dollars in FY 2010 for education purposes”\n“[f]or Arizona alone.” In 2000, Nogales voters approved a\nbudget override, “and the funds it has generated have\nincreased from $895,891 in FY 2001 to $1,750,825 in FY\n2010.” Funding per pupil in Nogales increased by 44% over\nthe past decade, from $3,675 in 2000 to $5,306 in 2010. The\ncourt concluded that “Nogales has an effective ELD program.\nIts FEP-2s [students who have reclassified as proficient for\ntwo years] rank higher on AIMs reading, writing, and\nmathematics at all elementary and middle grades,” and “[i]ts\nreclassification rates consistently have placed at the top or\nnear the top of nine sister districts at the border.”\n\f20                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\n    We conclude that the district court carefully followed the\nSupreme Court’s instructions on remand, and did not abuse\nits discretion in determining that in light of the changed\ncircumstances in Nogales and in the State over the course of\nmore than a decade, Rule 60(b)(5) relief was warranted.\n\n                              II.\n\n    We turn now to the question of whether the Flores\nPlaintiffs have alleged a statewide violation of the EEOA.\nOur conclusion that Rule 60(b)(5) relief was properly granted\nbecause the State Defendants’ ELL programs in Nogales\nconstitute “appropriate action” under the EEOA prefigures\nour conclusion that Arizona is not violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis. As the State Defendants observe, the\nexpansion of the injunction statewide “was made solely as a\nmeans (disagreed with by the Supreme Court) of affording\neffective relief in [Nogales]. Thus, with [Nogales]’s\nshortcomings having been fixed, and with it now conducting\nan effective ELD program, the rationale for granting\nstatewide relief collapses.” Nevertheless, because the\nSupreme Court instructed the district court, if “press[ed],” to\ndetermine whether “Arizona is violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis,” we proceed with an analysis of the Flores\nPlaintiffs’ statewide claims on appeal.\n\n    We note initially that the Flores Plaintiffs represent only\na class of Nogales students and their parents. The class was\nnever certified to extend statewide, and the Flores Plaintiffs\ndeclined to seek an expansion of the class. It appears that the\ndistrict court undertook no standing analysis when it extended\nits injunction to apply statewide. In its discussion of the\ndistrict court’s entry of statewide relief, the Supreme Court\nobserved that\n\f                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                      21\n\n       [t]he record contains no factual findings or\n       evidence that any school district other than\n       Nogales failed (much less continues to fail) to\n       provide equal educational opportunities to\n       ELL students. . . . Nor have respondents\n       explained how the EEOA could justify a\n       statewide injunction when the only violation\n       claimed or proven was limited to a single\n       school district.

It is not even\n       clear that the District Court had jurisdiction to\n       issue a statewide injunction when it is not\n       apparent that plaintiffs—a class of Nogales\n       students and their parents—had standing to\n       seek such relief.\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 470–71. Accordingly, “[a]ssuming that\npetitioners, on remand, press their objection to the statewide\nextension of the remedy, the District Court should vacate the\ninjunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales unless the\ncourt concludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA on a\nstatewide basis.” Id. at 472.\n\n    On remand, the district court permitted the Flores\nPlaintiffs to present evidence of a statewide violation of the\nEEOA that would justify the continued enforcement of the\nstatewide remedy. The district court concluded that,\n“Plaintiffs’ newly asserted claims are not ‘statewide’ in\nnature, but rather depend on specific implementation choices\nmade at the district level.” We hold that the district court\nproperly dismissed the Flores Plaintiffs’s statewide claims\nbecause the Flores Plaintiffs are not attacking the validity of\n\f22                   FLORES V.

In other words, in order to seek statewide relief on\nbehalf of all ELL students in Arizona, the Flores Plaintiffs\nmust demonstrate “widespread actual injury,” not just\n“isolated instances of actual injury,” as a result of Arizona’s\nalleged violation of the EEOA.

This is because\n\n       standing is not dispensed in gross. If the right\n       to complain of one administrative deficiency\n       automatically conferred the right to complain\n       of all administrative deficiencies, any citizen\n       aggrieved in one respect could bring the\n       whole structure of state administration before\n       the courts for review.

Indeed, the\nFlores Plaintiffs admit that they are not challenging the model\nas applied to all ELL students: “Plaintiffs believe that the\nmodels should be given a chance to work for first year\nEnglish language learners as the Legislature prescribed.”\nInstead it is the “[c]ontinued placement of elementary and\nhigh school students in the four hour model after the first year\n[that] constitutes a failure to take ‘appropriate action’ . . . .”\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs’ chief complaint is that the four-hour\nmodel is defective (i.e., does not constitute “appropriate\naction” under the EEOA) because “[t]he state does not\nrequire school districts to provide ELL students with an\nopportunity to recover the academic content that they missed\nwhile they were in the four hour model and makes no effort\nto determine whether ELL students have been deprived of\nacademic content as a result of being placed in four hours of\nELD.” But the EEOA imposes no such requirement on the\nschool districts; it requires only that a State “‘take appropriate\naction to overcome language barriers’ without specifying\nparticular actions that a State must take. . . .

For example,\nHumboldt Unified School District incorporates academic\nstandards promulgated by the State into its ELL curriculum,\nand delivers content-based instruction that conforms to those\nstandards. It also provides before-and-after-school programs,\nas well as summer school classes, to deliver academic content\nto ELL students.5 Amphitheater High School in the\nAmphitheater Public School District works with ELL\nstudents to place them in mainstream core classes, like math,\nat the same time that they are learning English in four-hour\nblocks. This district-by-district implementation of a general,\nState-mandated educational framework is consistent with the\nrequirements of the EEOA. Such local variation makes it\nimpossible for the Flores Plaintiffs to establish a widespread,\nhomogeneous injury sufficient to justify statewide injunctive\nrelief.\n\n   The Flores Plaintiffs also contend that “segregation” of\nELL students beyond the first year violates the EEOA\nbecause, by definition, it is not necessary to achieve\n\n   5\n      As the Flores Plaintiffs note, HB 2064 limits “‘compensatory\ninstruction’ outside the regular school day . . . to English language\ninstruction and does not include providing instruction to ELL students in\nacademic content areas that they may have missed as a result of\nparticipating in the Task Force models.” However, this does not change\nthe fact that, as with the standard four hours of ELD instruction during the\nschool day, the amount of core academic content disseminated during\ncompensatory instruction varies by school district.\n\f26                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nArizona’s stated academic goal of proficiency within one\nyear. They frame the injury that stems from this alleged\nviolation as a denial of ELL students’ educational\nopportunities. The argument is therefore duplicative of their\ncontention that the four-hour English language requirement\nviolates the EEOA because it results in ELL students\nreceiving less academic content than their English-speaking\npeers. This injury cannot provide a basis for a statewide\nremedy because the four-hour model is implemented\ndifferently across the State. For example, the model explicitly\nallows ELL students who have achieved an “intermediate”\nlevel of English proficiency and have passed certain tests to\nbe excused from up to two hours per day of ELD instruction.\nA.R.S. § 15-752(A) permits schools and districts to request\napproval of an alternative model, which in the case of\nGlendale Union High School has resulted in a program that\nallows juniors and seniors who are on track to graduate and\nwho meet certain other requirements to be exempted from\none to two hours of ELD instruction.\n\n    The Flores Plaintiffs are not arguing that four hours of\nELD instruction violates the EEOA per se, but rather that the\nState is violating the EEOA through proficiency grouping\nafter the first year, and by not also requiring districts “to\nprovide ELL students with an opportunity to recover missed\nacademic content.” These are not statewide claims; instead,\nthey contemplate alleged injuries that result from the\nimplementation of the four-hour model, which varies from\ndistrict to district, and cannot form the basis of claims for\nstatewide injunctive relief.\n\f                   FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                       27\n\n                       CONCLUSION\n\n    The Supreme Court gave clear instructions to the district\ncourt on remand. We conclude that the district court carefully\nfollowed those instructions. It was not an abuse of discretion\nto grant the State Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion because\nchanged circumstances warrant granting the State Defendants\nrelief from judgment. Likewise, the Flores Plaintiffs have not\nalleged a statewide violation of the EEOA that is adequate to\njustify the continued enforcement of a statewide injunction.\n\n   The pending motions are denied as moot. Each party shall\nbear its own costs on appeal.\n\n    AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFRIEDLAND, Circuit Judge, concurring in Parts I.1–I.4 of\nthe majority opinion, and concurring in the judgment:\n\n     I agree with the majority that the district court obeyed the\nSupreme Court’s directives regarding how the remand in this\ncase should proceed, and that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in, accordingly, granting Rule 60(b)(5) relief to\nDefendants. I nevertheless write separately because I\nunderstand Plaintiffs to be making additional arguments not\naddressed by the majority, and I believe their arguments merit\na response. Specifically, I understand Plaintiffs to be arguing\nthat, on its face, the four-hour English Language\nDevelopment (“ELD”) model adopted by the state Task Force\nviolates the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (“EEOA”)\nbecause it requires “segregation” of English Language\nLearners (“ELLs”) for four hours per day even after their first\n\f28                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nyear of ELD instruction. I also understand Plaintiffs to be\narguing that, even if the original statewide injunction is no\nlonger justified, an injunction should remain in place in\nNogales because Nogales’s implementation of the four-hour\nELD model results in loss of academic content and\nunnecessary segregation for ELLs and thus violates the\nEEOA.\n\n    In response to those arguments, I would hold that\nalthough Plaintiffs have standing to bring a facial challenge\nto the four-hour ELD model adopted by the Task Force for\nuse statewide, their challenge fails on the merits. Further, I\nwould hold that Plaintiffs have not shown that their new\nobjections to the four-hour model’s implementation in\nNogales constitute EEOA violations that require maintaining\nan injunction in this case.\n\n                              I.\n\n    Plaintiffs argue that the “four hour ELD requirement\nbeyond the first year violates the EEOA because the degree\nof segregation required by the State is not necessary to\nachieve the State’s academic goal of proficiency in one year.”\nI understand this to be a facial challenge to the statewide\nimposition of the four-hour ELD model.\n\n    In my view, Plaintiffs have standing to bring such a facial\nchallenge.    Plaintiffs have described a concrete and\nparticularized “injury in fact” because they are subject to the\nfour-hour model, and thus to its requirement that they learn\nEnglish in a separate classroom.

That injury is caused by\nthe four-hour model, and it is likely that changing the model\nwould lead Nogales to change its ELD program, so the\n\f                  FLORES V.

That Plaintiffs are all from\nNogales does not prevent them from having standing to\nfacially challenge what is effectively a state law, because the\nstatewide requirement impacts them personally.

HUPPENTHAL\n\nofficials”). It was not unreasonable for the Task Force to\nconclude that separating students by language proficiency for\nup to four hours each day would enable ELLs to develop their\nEnglish language skills most quickly. Indeed, Plaintiffs do\nnot even dispute this general principle. As the majority\nobserves, Plaintiffs admit that they are not challenging the\nfour-hour model as applied to first-year ELLs. Plaintiffs\noffer no support for their proposed distinction between the\nfirst and subsequent years of ELD—either in terms of why\nstudying in a separate classroom becomes less helpful for\nlanguage acquisition after the first year or in terms of why\nthis separation becomes more harmful. Their facial challenge\nto the statewide requirement that ELLs receive English\ninstruction in a separate classroom after the first year is\ntherefore unavailing.\n\n                                   II.\n\n    I understand Plaintiffs to be making the additional\nargument that Nogales’s implementation of the four-hour\nmodel violates the EEOA by providing insufficient access to\nacademic content for ELLs and by separating ELLs from\ntheir mainstream peers more than is necessary to teach them\nEnglish. These arguments differ from Plaintiffs’ original\nclaim in this lawsuit (that Nogales’s inadequate funding of\nELD violated the EEOA), and Plaintiffs’ new arguments are\nnot clearly addressed by the four considerations that the\nSupreme Court articulated in response to the original funding-\nbased claim.1 Horne, 557 U.S. at 459. As students from\n\n\n 1\n   Although these claims were not part of Plaintiffs’ original lawsuit, and\nalthough Plaintiffs presented these arguments in the district court\nprimarily as statewide challenges to the four-hour ELD model, the district\ncourt explicitly reached these arguments, construing them as challenges\n\f                     FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                             31\n\nNogales, there is no question that Plaintiffs have standing to\nmake these arguments. On the current record, however, the\nchallenges to the implementation of the four-hour model in\nNogales fail on the merits.\n\n    With regard to ELLs’ access to academic content in\nNogales, the district court found that “Nogales has an\neffective ELD program.” Based on the performance of\nformer ELLs in Nogales, this factual finding was not clearly\nerroneous. Former ELLs who have been classified as\nEnglish-proficient for at least two years (“FEP-2s”) met or\nexceeded state and district averages on AIMS tests in almost\nall subject-grade combinations in 2006–2009—all of the\nyears for which AIMS data are available in the record.\n\n    The district court also appropriately found that Nogales\nprovides substantial support for ELLs and former ELLs to\ncompensate for any diminished exposure to academic content\nresulting from ELD. For example, Nogales offers summer\nschool and after-school tutoring. These programs cover\nacademic subject areas beyond English, including support for\nscience and math. The fact that FEP-2s in Nogales had a high\nschool graduation rate over 90% each year between 2006 and\n2010 also supports the conclusion that ELLs are eventually\nexposed to necessary academic content.\n\n    With regard to their segregation allegations, Plaintiffs\nargue that, pursuant to guidance provided by the Department\nof Education’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), Nogales’s\n\n\nto Nogales’s implementation of the Task Force model. Defendants have\nnot argued that Plaintiffs waived these Nogales-specific arguments by not\npresenting them more distinctly below, or by not raising them earlier in\nthe litigation.\n\f32                FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL\n\nimplementation of the four-hour model violates the EEOA\nbecause it is not “the least segregative manner” of ELD.\n“Dear Colleague” Letter from U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Civil\nRights Div., and U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Office for Civil Rights\n22 (Jan. 7, 2015), available at http://www2.ed.gov/about/\noffices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf. The OCR\nletter interprets the EEOA as requiring schools to “avoid\nunnecessary segregation of” ELLs, and opines that a program\nthat separated ELL from non-ELL students “in subjects like\nphysical education, art, and music” or “during activity periods\noutside of classroom instruction” probably would violate this\nrequirement. Id. Assuming that the OCR letter correctly\ninterprets the EEOA, Plaintiffs have not put forward evidence\nshowing that implementation of the four-hour model in\nNogales results in language-ability-based grouping for more\nthan the ELD portion of the day. To the contrary, Defendants\nhave presented evidence that ELLs in Nogales participate in\nextracurricular activities alongside non-ELLs, and that former\nELLs have access to the full academic curriculum.\n\n                          *   *    *\n\n    The record does not contain enough years of ELL\nperformance data after the implementation of the four-hour\nmodel to be certain of the model’s effectiveness at teaching\nEnglish or of its long-term impact on overall academic\nsuccess. The district court appropriately concluded, however,\nthat, based on the evidence that does exist, Plaintiffs could\nnot show their new challenges to the implementation of the\nfour-hour model in Nogales require maintaining an\ninjunction.\n\n    If evidence of an EEOA violation emerges in the future,\na new lawsuit could of course be brought. But the district\n\f                  FLORES V. HUPPENTHAL                     33\n\ncourt here correctly concluded that the current lawsuit “is no\nlonger the vehicle to pursue the myriad of educational issues”\nabout which Plaintiffs are concerned. The district court\nappropriately concluded that the injunction imposed in this\nlawsuit is no longer justified by Plaintiffs’ original claims,\nand that their new claims fare no better. The district court\ntherefore did not err in vacating the injunction.\n\f</pre>",
