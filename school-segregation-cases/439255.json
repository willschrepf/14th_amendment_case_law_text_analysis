Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n        Palmer College of Chiropractic (Palmer) is a chiropractic school\n\nwith campuses located in Iowa, Florida, and California. At its Davenport,\n\nIowa location, Palmer administers bachelor of science and doctor of\n\nchiropractic programs.    Aaron Cannon applied to Palmer’s bachelor of\n\nscience program at its Davenport, Iowa location, in the early spring of\n\n2004.\n\n        Cannon had informed Palmer he was blind early in the application\n\nprocess.    Palmer directed him to its contact person for students with\n\ndisabilities, and Cannon met with the representative that spring. At that\n\nmeeting, Cannon explained he had sometimes taken examinations with\n\nthe assistance of a sighted reader in the past, he planned on completing\n\nthe graduate program’s undergraduate prerequisites and matriculating\n\nin the graduate program in March 2005, and he was in the process of\n\nregistering and exploring additional accommodations for his blindness\n\nwith the Iowa Department for the Blind (IDOB).              The Palmer\n\nrepresentative told Cannon she would discuss this information further\n\f                                    4\n\nwith key representatives of Palmer.       She also revealed to Cannon,\n\nhowever, that Palmer had in the summer of 2002 adopted certain\n\ntechnical standards for admission to and graduation from its degree\n\nprograms.\n\n      The technical standards adopted for each of Palmer’s three\n\ncampuses across the country require that degree candidates have\n\n“sufficient use of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation necessary to\n\nperform chiropractic and general physical examination, including the\n\nprocedures of inspection, palpation, auscultations, and the review of\n\nradiographs as taught in the curriculum.”     Based on these standards,\n\nthe Palmer representative explained, Cannon would find it difficult, if not\n\nimpossible, to enter and complete Palmer’s graduate program.\n\n      Despite the caution Palmer’s representative expressed in the spring\n\n2004 meeting, Cannon was admitted to Palmer’s undergraduate program\n\na few months later. He was also provisionally admitted to the graduate\n\nprogram, contingent on his successful completion of the required\n\nundergraduate coursework—without, apparently, any further inquiry as\n\nto if or how Cannon might satisfy Palmer’s technical standards. Cannon\n\nenrolled in July 2004 and began coursework in the undergraduate\n\nprogram.\n\n      In August, shortly after enrolling, Cannon met again with Palmer’s\n\ndisability representative to discuss possible accommodations.          The\n\nPalmer representative indicated she would arrange a meeting with\n\nPalmer’s Disability Steering Committee in the next two weeks to further\n\ndiscuss possibilities.   While waiting for that meeting to materialize,\n\nCannon sent the Palmer representative an email detailing his skills and\n\ncapabilities for dealing with certain visual challenges. He noted in the\n\nemail his familiarity with various adaptive technologies, including\n\f                                         5\n\ntechnologies for note taking and producing tactile versions of images and\n\ndiagrams, and his history of success in previous classes having\n\nsignificant visual components.           Two trimesters later, Cannon had\n\nsuccessfully completed the graduate program’s required undergraduate\n\ncoursework, achieving a cumulative grade point average of 3.44 on a 4.0-\n\npoint scale.1\n\n       As he neared completion of the undergraduate coursework, a\n\nmeeting with Palmer’s Disability Steering Committee was finally arranged\n\nin February 2005. Cannon reiterated his interest in preparing for and\n\nenrolling in the graduate program at the meeting.                    The steering\n\ncommittee again expressed doubt Cannon would be able to complete the\n\nprogram because Palmer’s technical standards required sufficient use of\n\nvision.   Cannon suggested several possible accommodations for the\n\nvisual components of the curriculum, including a sighted reader and\n\nmodifications of certain practical examinations, while acknowledging he\n\ncould not yet anticipate each challenge that might present itself in the\n\ngraduate program.       The steering committee suggested these could not\n\nconstitute acceptable accommodations for certain diagnostic portions of\n\nthe curriculum and explained Cannon would therefore reach a “stoppage\n\npoint,” after which he would no longer be able to meet Palmer’s\n\nrequirements for advancement in the program. That point, the steering\n\ncommittee advised, would occur at the beginning of the fifth semester—\n\nthe point at which students were slated to begin radiology and other\n\ndiagnostic coursework. Cannon proposed that a sighted assistant might\n\n\n\n       1The  record reveals Cannon’s grade point average may have been negatively\naffected by the fact he missed his anatomy final in the winter of 2005 to be with his\nwife, who gave birth on the same day.\n\f                                     6\n\ncommunicate to him the pertinent visual information in these courses\n\nenabling him to analyze it and to learn to make diagnoses accordingly.\n\n      The steering committee expressed doubt as to the feasibility of\n\nCannon’s proposed accommodation, suggesting it would place too much\n\nresponsibility on the assistant. The committee thus repeated its position\n\nthat the beginning of the fifth semester would constitute the stoppage\n\npoint, but Cannon proposed they cross that bridge later after further\n\ninvestigation. Given the committee’s apparent reliance on the recently\n\nadopted   technical    standards    in   concluding   Cannon’s   proposed\n\naccommodations were unacceptable, Cannon asked about the purpose of\n\nthe standards and whether they might be modifiable.        The committee\n\nexplained modification would compromise Palmer’s compliance with\n\nstandards promulgated by the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE),\n\nthe national accreditation body.     The CCE standards, the committee\n\nexplained, were “not negotiable.”\n\n      Cannon was undeterred and enrolled in the graduate program,\n\napparently without objection from Palmer, a few days later.       Cannon\n\nbelieved with further investigation, he and Palmer could find an\n\naccommodation that would allow him to continue in the program and\n\neventually graduate.    Two weeks after his meeting with the steering\n\ncommittee, Cannon sent a letter to Palmer’s president, expressing his\n\nfrustration with the trajectory the meeting had taken.      In the letter,\n\nCannon noted he was aware of numerous blind individuals who had\n\nbecome successful chiropractors in the past, including at least two who\n\nhad graduated from Palmer. In addition, Cannon explained IDOB had at\n\nits disposal “a wealth of information about strategies and techniques” for\n\ncoping with some of the challenges Palmer foresaw and suggested Palmer\n\f                                         7\n\nshould consult with IDOB before rejecting out of hand his requests and\n\nsuggestions for accommodation.\n\n      Palmer responded to Cannon’s letter a month and a half later in\n\nmid-April.   Palmer explained its adoption of technical standards was\n\nconsistent with the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nof 1990 and the earlier-existing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n(Rehabilitation Act). Those laws proscribed discrimination on the basis\n\nof disability, Palmer explained, but they did not require an institution to\n\nprovide accommodations or curricular modifications if they would\n\nfundamentally     alter   the    institution’s   educational   program.      The\n\ncurricular modifications Palmer had granted to blind students in the\n\npast, Palmer explained, would not satisfy its current technical standards,\n\nand thus any similar modification now would constitute a fundamental\n\nalteration of its new program as defined by the technical standards.\n\nNevertheless, Palmer explained, it would contact IDOB to inquire about\n\nother possible accommodations.\n\n      A   month     later,      two   Palmer     representatives   met    with   a\n\nrepresentative from IDOB.         Notes from the meeting indicate “no new\n\ninformation” was presented—Palmer explained its technical standards\n\nwere necessary for accreditation and the accommodations proposed by\n\nCannon would not satisfy these standards.              The IDOB representative\n\npointed out a blind individual had recently graduated from medical\n\nschool in Wisconsin and the school had maintained its accreditation, but\n\nthe Palmer representatives declined to explore further the investigation\n\nand accommodations the school had made. Instead, they stressed the\n\nimportance of their own technical standards and their concern about the\n\ntime, effort, and money Cannon had already expended and would\n\ncontinue to expend despite their indications he would be unable to\n\f                                           8\n\ncomplete the program.            Although the IDOB representative noted the\n\nmeeting       “concluded   with     no    real   progress    made,”       the   Palmer\n\nrepresentatives stated they remained open to further guidance from the\n\nIDOB.\n\n       Cannon received a meeting report, summarizing the Palmer–IDOB\n\nconversation,      from    the     IDOB     representative      shortly    thereafter.\n\nFrustrated,     and   without      any    indication   Palmer     intended      further\n\ninvestigation, Cannon filed a notice of withdrawal from the graduate\n\nprogram a few weeks later in early June 2005, before completing final\n\ncoursework for his first trimester in the program. His grade report for\n\nthe incomplete trimester indicated two grades of “C,” five grades of “No\n\nCredit,” and withdrawal from one class. Cannon later testified that prior\n\nto withdrawal, he had been confident he would receive strong grades for\n\nthe term given his prior record at Palmer, but because he had withdrawn\n\nbefore final examinations and therefore missed and received no credit for\n\nthem, he was left with the weak record on the report.2\n\n       Cannon filed a complaint with the Davenport Civil Rights\n\nCommission (commission) in July, contending Palmer had discriminated\n\nagainst him on the basis of his disability in violation of the Davenport\nCivil Rights Ordinance (DCRO), the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA), and\n\nfederal antidiscrimination laws. After reviewing the facts and applicable\n\nlaws, the commission found probable cause existed to demonstrate\n\ndiscrimination, and the matter came before the commission for public\n\nhearing in February 2010. The two-day hearing featured testimony and\n\nexhibits from Cannon, Cannon’s wife, three Palmer faculty members and\n\n       2The record reveals Cannon’s withdrawal near the end of the trimester came too\nlate for Cannon to receive grades of “Incomplete.” He nevertheless chose to withdraw\nand miss his final examinations, which resulted in the grades of “C” and “No Credit.”\n\f                                        9\n\nofficials, and a blind graduate of Palmer who now works as a\n\nchiropractor.\n\n       A few months after the hearing, the commission hearing officer\n\nissued a proposed order, finding Cannon had proved by a preponderance\n\nPalmer had discriminated on the basis of his blindness and granting\n\nproposed relief of damages equal to Cannon’s previous cost of\n\nattendance, emotional distress damages, and attorney fees and costs.\n\nCannon      submitted    exceptions    to    the   proposed   order,   requesting\n\nreadmission with reasonable accommodation and an order enjoining\n\nPalmer’s strict application of its technical standards to blind individuals.\n\nPalmer submitted its own exceptions, requesting that the commission\n\nreject the proposed order in its entirety, dismiss the complaint, and\n\nassess costs to Cannon.\n\n       The parties addressed their exceptions at oral argument before the\n\ncommission in August.         After deliberations at its next two closed\n\nsessions, the commission issued a final order adopting the hearing\n\nofficer’s   proposed    conclusion    that    Cannon    had   proven    disability\n\ndiscrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.             The commission\n\nsupplemented its final order with the injunctive readmission and\n\naccommodation Cannon had requested.\n\n       In support of its order, the commission set forth extensive findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law. More specifically, the commission found\n\nCannon was a person with a disability and “an otherwise qualified”\n\nstudent under the relevant federal, state, and municipal code provisions;\n\nhe had requested specific accommodations for his blindness from Palmer\n\non multiple occasions; and Palmer had denied these requests and failed\n\nto engage in the interactive investigative process required by federal and\n\nstate disability law. Further, the commission found, Cannon’s requested\n\f                                     10\n\naccommodations would not fundamentally alter Palmer’s curriculum,\n\nbecause Palmer had previously graduated blind students from its Iowa\n\ncampus, Palmer’s California campus already waived certain vision-\n\nspecific competencies in its technical standards based on California\n\nantidiscrimination   law,   Palmer    had     presented   no   evidence   its\n\naccreditation had been compromised by accommodations similar to those\n\nCannon had requested or by the California competency waivers, and\n\nPalmer had presented no evidence state licensing boards would exclude\n\nblind individuals from practice.     Based on these factual findings, the\n\ncommission concluded Cannon was otherwise qualified to participate in\n\nPalmer’s graduate program and was denied participation in the program\n\non the basis of his disability.      The commission therefore concluded\n\nPalmer’s strict application of its technical standards to Cannon violated\n\nthe DCRO, ICRA, and the ADA.\n\n      Palmer sought judicial review of the final order. The district court,\n\nexplaining it was reviewing the commission’s legal conclusions for errors\n\nof law and the commission’s factual findings for substantial evidence,\n\nreversed the commission’s order.          Without explicitly suggesting the\n\ncommission’s factual findings were unsupported by substantial evidence,\n\nthe district court determined the commission had failed, as a matter of\n\nlaw, to give appropriate deference to Palmer’s identification of its\n\ncurricular requirements, and therefore concluded substantial evidence\n\nsupported Palmer’s claims that Cannon’s suggested accommodation was\n\nunreasonable and would constitute a fundamental alteration of the\n\nPalmer curriculum.\n\n      Cannon appealed the district court decision and we retained the\n\nappeal.\n\f                                    11\n\n      II. Scope and Standards of Review.\n\n      Our general assembly has directed that final decisions of\n\nmunicipal civil rights commissions shall be reviewable to the same extent\n\nas final decisions of the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC). See Iowa\n\nCode § 216.19 (2013). We review decisions of the ICRC according to the\n\nstandards delineated in Iowa’s Administrative Procedure Act, set forth in\n\nchapter 17A of the Iowa Code. Id. § 216.17; see Botsko v. Davenport Civil\n\nRights Comm’n, 774 N.W.2d 841, 844 (Iowa 2009).           We are therefore\n\nbound by the commission’s findings of fact if supported by substantial\n\nevidence. Botsko, 774 N.W.2d at 844; see also Iowa Code § 17A.19(10)(f).\n\nWe will not, however, give deference to the commission’s interpretation of\n\nprovisions of law not vested in its discretion and will review those\n\ninterpretations for legal errors. See Rent-A-Ctr., Inc. v. Iowa Civil Rights\n\nComm’n, 843 N.W.2d 727, 730 (Iowa 2014); Botsko, 774 N.W.2d at 844;\n\nsee also Iowa Code § 17A.19(10)(c). We apply the standards of chapter\n\n17A on appeal to determine if our conclusions are the same as the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusions.   See Sunrise Ret. Cmty. v. Iowa Dep’t of\n\nHuman Servs., 833 N.W.2d 216, 219 (Iowa 2013).\n\n      III. Discussion.\n\n      Section 216.9 of ICRA provides, in general terms, that “[i]t is an\n\nunfair or discriminatory practice for any educational institution to\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of . . . disability in any program or activity.”\n\nIowa Code § 216.9. The DCRO sets forth the same general language in\n\nextending its own protections against disability discrimination, to\n\n“provide for the execution within the city of the policies embodied in the\n\nIowa Civil Rights Act of 1965 and” related federal civil rights laws. See\n\nDavenport, Iowa, Mun. Code § 2.58.010(B) (2013); id. § 2.58.125(A).\n\nFederal law extends its own disability discrimination protections in both\n\f                                      12\n\nthe ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101–12213 (2006);\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n\n      We have often explained we will look to the ADA and cases\n\ninterpreting its language, as well as cases interpreting the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, for guidance as we analyze disability discrimination claims brought\n\nunder ICRA. See, e.g., Fuller v. Iowa Dep’t of Human Servs., 576 N.W.2d\n\n324, 329 (Iowa 1998).       We have also explained we may look to the\n\nregulations underlying the federal acts in our analysis. Id. While these\n\nauthorities are often persuasive, we note we are also guided by the\n\nbreadth of the protections very clearly set forth in both ICRA and the\n\nDCRO.    See Iowa Code § 216.18(1) (“This chapter shall be construed\n\nbroadly to effectuate its purposes.”); Davenport, Iowa, Mun. Code\n\n§ 2.58.020 (“This chapter shall be construed broadly to effectuate its\n\npurpose.”).\n\n      While ICRA and the DCRO set forth their protections in general\n\nterms, without language of limitation, the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA\n\ncontain additional content in their statutory provisions.           The ADA,\n\napplicable to all academic institutions receiving federal funding, provides\n\nthat “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability . . . be denied the benefits of the . . . programs . . . of a public\n\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12132. The Rehabilitation Act sets forth a similar standard, providing\n\n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by\n\nreason of her or his disability . . . be denied the benefits of . . . any\n\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”        29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794.   Both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act specifically prohibit\n\ndiscrimination against those with disabilities based not just on\n\f                                         13\n\n“affirmative    animus,”      but    also     any    discrimination      based      on\n\nthoughtlessness, apathy, or stereotype.3 See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate,\n\n469 U.S. 287, 295–97, 105 S. Ct. 712, 717–18, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661, 668–69\n\n(1985).\n\n       In the context of higher education, Rehabilitation Act regulations\n\nexplain a qualified individual is one “who meets the academic and\n\ntechnical standards requisite to admission or participation in the\n\nrecipient’s education program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. § 104.3(l)(3) (2013).\n\nEducational institutions are required, however, to provide “such\n\nmodifications . . . as are necessary” to aid individuals in meeting these\n\nacademic and technical standards, to ensure requirements do not\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of disability.            Id. § 104.44(a).       The ADA\n\nincorporates a closely related accommodation requirement in defining a\n\n“qualified individual with a disability” as one “who, with or without\n\nreasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices . . . or the\n\nprovision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility\n\nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs\n\nor activities provided.”      42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).          Various courts have\n\nexplained the ADA’s “reasonable modification” requirement and the\n\nRehabilitation Act’s accommodation requirement impose coextensive\n\n\n       3The   ADA goes further, defining discrimination in the context of public\naccommodation to include: (1) any use of criteria that unnecessarily “screen out” or\n“tend to screen out” individuals with disabilities; (2) failure to make nonfundamental,\nreasonable modifications of “policies, practices or procedures” when modification is\nnecessary to accommodate those with disabilities; and (3) failure to take necessary\nsteps “to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services,\nsegregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals.”         42 U.S.C.\n§ 12182(b)(2)(A) (defining “discrimination” under the ADA); see also 34 C.F.R.\n§§ 104.43—104.44 (2013) (implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act); 28\nC.F.R. § 36.103 (explaining the ADA “shall not be construed to apply a lesser standard\nthan the standard to be applied” under Section 504).\n\f                                          14\n\nobligations,    and    the    terms    and     standards     may     often   be    used\n\ninterchangeably.      See, e.g., Wong v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 192 F.3d\n\n807, 816 n.26 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n       Evaluating these statutory and regulatory standards in cases\n\ninvolving claims of disability discrimination in higher education, courts\n\nhave required a claimant establish the following elements: (1) the\n\nclaimant is a person with a disability under the relevant statute or\n\nstatutes; (2) the claimant is qualified to participate in the program or, in\n\nother words, can meet the essential eligibility requirements of the\n\nprogram with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) the\n\nclaimant was denied the benefits of the program because of his or her\n\ndisability.4   See, e.g., id. at 816; Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n v. Case W.\n\nReserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d 1376, 1383 (Ohio 1996). We have previously\n\nadopted a substantially similar framework for analysis in the context of\n\nemployment discrimination claims brought under ICRA and its federal\n\nanalogues. See, e.g., Boelman v. Manson State Bank, 522 N.W.2d 73, 79\n\n(Iowa 1994) (requiring discharge based on disability in place of denial of\n\nbenefits based on disability). The parties have not suggested we apply a\n\ndifferent framework for purposes of analyzing education discrimination\nclaims brought under ICRA and the DCRO, and thus we apply our\n\nfamiliar disability discrimination framework to each of the claims at\n\nissue here. Further, because the parties do not dispute that Cannon is a\n\nperson with a disability under each of the relevant statutes and do not\n\nseriously dispute that he was denied the benefits of the program because\n\n\n        4In analyzing claims brought under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, courts have\n\nadded a fourth element: evidence the institution receives federal financial assistance or\nis a public entity. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 816. The parties concede here Palmer\nreceives federal financial assistance for purposes of Cannon’s federal claims and the\nfederal assistance requirement is inapplicable to Cannon’s state and municipal claims.\n\f                                           15\n\nof his disability, we consider here only the question of whether Cannon\n\nwas qualified to participate in the Palmer program with reasonable\n\naccommodation.5\n       1. The meaning of “Qualified with Reasonable Accommodation.” As\n\nnoted, the relevant federal acts and regulations define qualified\n\nindividuals as those individuals who, with reasonable accommodation or\n\n“modification,” can meet the “essential eligibility requirements”6 of the\n\ninstitution.     42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).7           In interpreting the meaning of\n\nreasonable accommodation, the United States Supreme Court has noted\n\nregulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act provide reasonable\n\n“[m]odifications may include changes in the length of time permitted for\n\nthe completion of degree requirements, substitution of specific courses\n\nrequired for the completion of degree requirements, and adaptation of the\n\n       5Palmer   notes other courts have sometimes expressed the “was denied the\nbenefits of the program” element of the analysis as a requirement that a claimant has\nbeen “dismissed” from the program. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 816. Because Cannon\nwithdrew from the graduate program on his own, Palmer suggests he may not have met\na “dismissal” requirement. We note, however, the relevant statutes here require only\nthat a claimant be “denied the benefits” of the program for purposes of making out a\nclaim. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794; Iowa Code § 216.9(1)(a); Davenport, Iowa,\nMun. Code § 2.58.125(A)(1). Palmer concedes Cannon would have been denied the\nbenefits of the program by the fifth trimester, if not earlier, based on his blindness, and\nthus we need not address the element further here.\n       6As noted, relevant Rehabilitation Act regulations set forth slightly different\nlanguage in explaining a qualified individual may be required to “meet[] the academic\nand technical standards requisite to admission or participation in the recipient’s\neducation program or activity.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(l)(3).\n        7We note the Rehabilitation Act adds the term “otherwise” in prohibiting\n\ndiscrimination against an “otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794(a). Numerous courts have explained despite this slight difference in terminology,\nthe analyses of claims under both laws proceeds in much the same way. See, e.g.,\nForest City Daly Hous., Inc. v. Town of North Hempstead, 175 F.3d 144, 150 n.7 (2d Cir.\n1999) (noting this linguistic difference between ADA and Rehabilitation Act); Nelson v.\nMiller, 170 F.3d 641, 649 (6th Cir. 1999) (noting analyses under the two provisions do\nnot differ significantly). See generally Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 166 F.3d 1041,\n1045 n.11 (1999) (collecting cases pointing out relationship between the ADA and\nRehabilitation Act).\n\f                                          16\n\nmanner in which specific courses are conducted.” See Se. Cmty. Coll. v.\n\nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, 408 n.9, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2368 n.9, 60 L. Ed. 2d\n\n980, 990 n.9 (1979) (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.44); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1630.2(o)(2)     (providing,    in    employment        discrimination      context,\n\n“[r]easonable accommodation may include but is not limited to: . . .\n\nacquisition or modifications of equipment or devices; appropriate\n\nadjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or\n\npolicies; the provision of qualified readers or interpreters; and other\n\nsimilar accommodations for individuals with disabilities” (emphasis\n\nomitted)).\n\n       Further, the Supreme Court has noted, reasonable modifications\n\nin the form of “[a]uxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or\n\nother effective methods . . ., readers in libraries for students with visual\n\nimpairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students with\n\nmanual impairments, and other similar services and actions.”                    Davis,\n\n442 U.S. at 408 n.9, 99 S. Ct. at 2368 n.9, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990 n.9\n\n(quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.44); Nelson v. Thornburgh, 567 F. Supp. 369, 380\n\n(E.D. Pa. 1983) (“[T]he provision of readers is an express HHS example of\n\nreasonable accommodation.” (Internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted.)). Reasonable modification need not include, however, “ ‘devices\n\nor services of a personal nature.’ ”8 Davis, 442 U.S. at 408 n.9, 99 S. Ct.\n\n\n\n       8Palmer  suggests this “personal nature” principle might apply to Cannon given\nhis status as the only student at Palmer currently requesting accommodation. We find\nthe suggestion unpersuasive—we cannot conclude the implementing regulation in\nquestion simply absolves institutions of their obligation of accommodation in cases\nwhere requests are made by individuals, as opposed to groups of students. Instead, we\nbelieve the regulation indicates the “personal nature” principle is directed to services\nand devices dedicated exclusively to individuals—services that cannot, by their nature,\ntypically also be used as accommodation by other individuals.            See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 104.44(d)(2). Palmer has not suggested Cannon’s requests fit that latter description.\n\f                                    17\n\nat 2368 n.9, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990 n.9 (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.44). In\n\naddition, an accommodation may not be reasonable, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explained, if it imposes “undue financial [or] administrative burdens”\n\non the institution, or if it requires “a fundamental alteration in the\n\nnature of [the] program” offered. Id. at 410–12, 99 S. Ct. at 2369–70, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990–92. Because the parties have not raised below or on\n\nappeal   an   issue   of   undue    burden    with   respect   to   possible\n\naccommodations, and because Cannon’s requests fit plausibly within the\n\nrange of accommodations recognized as reasonable by courts and the\n\nADA’s implementing regulation, we consider here only the issue of\n\nwhether accommodation would constitute a fundamental alteration of\n\nPalmer’s program.\n\n      2. The general contours of the fundamental alteration analysis. In\n\nDavis, the Supreme Court encountered a case of a student with\n\nsubstantial hearing loss who sought nursing training at Southeastern\n\nCommunity College, in pursuit of her eventual goal of state nursing\n\ncertification in North Carolina.     Id. at 400, 99 S. Ct. at 2364, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 985–86. Upon learning of the student’s hearing loss in the\n\napplication process, Southeastern consulted its entire nursing faculty,\n\nan outside audiologist, and the director of the North Carolina nursing\n\nboard, as part of its process of determining whether the student could be\n\nadmitted to the Southeastern program and whether the student could\n\nlater safely participate in Southeastern’s clinical training program. Id. at\n\n401–02, 99 S. Ct. at 2364–65, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 985–86. Based largely on\n\nthe views of the nursing board director that the student had “hearing\n\nlimitations which could interfere with her safely caring for patients,” and\n\nlimitations that could make it “impossible for [the student] to participate\n\nsafely in the normal clinical training program,” Southeastern denied the\n\f                                        18\n\nstudent admission.       Id. at 401–02, 99 S. Ct. at 2365, 60 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n985–86.\n\n       Relying on those conclusions, the Supreme Court explained\n\n“Southeastern, with prudence, could [therefore] allow [the student] to\n\ntake only academic classes.”          Id. at 409–10, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990.     Whatever benefits the student might have received\n\nfrom an academic course of study, the Court explained, “she would not\n\nreceive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursing program\n\nnormally gives.” Id. at 410, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990. That\n\nkind   of    modification,   the   Court     concluded,   would    constitute   a\n\n“fundamental alteration” of Southeastern’s nursing program far greater\n\nthan the reasonable “modification” required by federal laws and\n\nregulations. Id.\n\n       In reaching its conclusion on the fundamental alteration question\n\nthirty-five years ago, however, the Supreme Court explained the line\n\nbetween reasonable accommodation and fundamental alteration would\n\nnot always be so neatly drawn in the future.           Id. at 412, 99 S. Ct. at\n\n2370, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 992.         “It is possible to envision situations,” the\n\nCourt observed, “where an insistence on continuing past requirements\n\nand practices” may deprive “genuinely qualified” persons of opportunities\n\nfor participation in educational programs. Id. Technological advances,\n\nthe Court explained, should be expected to enhance and appropriately\n\nadapt opportunities for individuals with disabilities without undue\n\nburden, and refusals to modify programs accordingly may then\n\nconstitute discrimination under the relevant laws.          Id. at 412–13, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 2370, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 992.         Identification of instances where\n\nrefusal     to   accommodate       constitutes   discrimination,    the    Court\n\nemphasized,      would   therefore    remain     an   important    and    ongoing\n\f                                      19\n\nresponsibility of those tasked with implementation and application of our\n\ndisability discrimination laws. Id.\n\n       Courts later applying the teachings of Davis have explained it\n\n“struck a balance” between the statutory rights ensuring those with\n\ndisabilities “meaningful access” to the benefits offered by educational\n\ninstitutions, and “the legitimate interests” of those institutions “in\n\npreserving the integrity of their programs.” Alexander, 469 U.S. at 300,\n\n105 S. Ct. at 720, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 671; Case W. Reserve Univ., 666\n\nN.E.2d   at   1384   (quoting   Alexander).   To   strike   that   balance\n\nappropriately, the Supreme Court has observed, courts and educational\n\ninstitutions alike must take great care not to define the benefit or\n\nprogram “in a way that effectively denies otherwise qualified . . .\n\nindividuals [with disabilities] the meaningful access to which they are\n\nentitled.” Alexander, 469 U.S. at 301, 105 S. Ct. at 720, 83 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n672.\n\n       Recognizing this fine line, lower courts have elucidated two\n\nprinciples in the fundamental alteration analysis that guide us in our\n\ninquiry here.   First, courts have recognized that in considering the\n\ninterests of educational institutions in the integrity of their programs,\n\nsome deference to the institution’s professional or academic judgment\n\nmay often be appropriate. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 817; Wynne v.\n\nTufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 932 F.2d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 1991).         Second,\n\nhowever, whether and the extent to which that deference is appropriate\n\ndepends heavily on the institution’s satisfaction of several obligations.\n\nSee Wong, 192 F.3d at 817–18; Wynne, 932 F.2d at 25–26.               The\n\ninstitution, for example, has a “real obligation” to seek out “suitable\n\nmeans of reasonably accommodating” individuals with disabilities and to\n\nsubmit “a factual record indicating” it “conscientiously carried out this\n\f                                     20\n\nstatutory obligation.”   Wynne, 932 F.2d at 25–26; see also Wong, 192\n\nF.3d at 818 (“Subsumed within this standard is the institution’s duty to\n\nmake itself aware of the nature of the student’s disability [and] to explore\n\nalternatives for accommodating the student[.]”). That obligation requires\n\nan individualized and extensive inquiry—an institution must “carefully\n\nconsider[] each disabled student’s particular limitations and analyz[e]\n\nwhether and how it might accommodate that student in a way that\n\nwould allow the student to complete the school’s program without\n\nlowering academic standards.” Wong, 192 F.3d at 826; see Mark H. v.\n\nHamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir. 2010) (“ ‘[M]ere speculation\n\nthat a suggested accommodation is not feasible falls short of the\n\nreasonable accommodation requirement; [the Rehabilitation Act] create[s]\n\na duty to gather sufficient information from the disabled individual and\n\nqualified experts as needed to determine what accommodations are\n\nnecessary.’ ” (quoting Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1136\n\n(9th Cir. 2001))); Hall v. U.S. Postal Serv., 857 F.2d 1073, 1079 (6th Cir.\n\n1988) (“[T]he determination of whether physical qualifications are\n\nessential functions of a job requires the [fact finder] to engage in a highly\n\nfact-specific inquiry. Such a determination should be based upon more\n\nthan statements in a job description and should reflect the actual\n\nfunctioning and circumstances of the particular enterprise involved.”\n\n(Citation omitted.)); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty. v. Arline, 480 U.S.\n\n273, 287, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 1130–31, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307, 320 (“[T]he [fact\n\nfinder] will need to conduct an individualized inquiry and make\n\nappropriate findings of fact. Such an inquiry is essential if § 504 is to\n\nachieve its goal of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations\n\nbased on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear . . . .”).\n\f                                       21\n\n      Furthermore,    institutions     cannot      merely    look   to   “accepted\n\nacademic norms,” in exploring reasonable accommodations—because\n\nreasonable alternatives may often “involve new approaches or devices\n\nquite beyond ‘accepted academic norms.’ ”             Wynne, 932 F.2d at 26\n\n(quoting Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225, 106 S. Ct\n\n507, 513, 88 L. Ed. 2d 523, 532 (1985)); cf. Strathie v. Dep’t of Transp.,\n\n716 F.2d 227, 231 (3d Cir. 1983) (rejecting “broad judicial deference\n\nresembling that associated with the ‘rational basis’ test [which] would\n\nsubstantially undermine Congress’ intent . . . that stereotypes or\n\ngeneralizations not deny handicapped individuals equal access to\n\nfederally-funded programs” (footnote omitted)); Pushkin v. Regents of\n\nUniv. of Colo., 658 F.2d 1372, 1383 (10th Cir. 1981) (“[The Rehabilitation\n\nAct] provides that a recipient of federal financial assistance may not\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of handicap, regardless of whether there is a\n\nrational basis for so discriminating. The inquiry has to be on whether\n\nthe University has, in fact, discriminated on the basis of handicap. The\n\nmere fact that the University acted in a rational manner is no defense to\n\nan act of discrimination.”).\n\n      We require institutions to fulfill these obligations, courts have\n\nexplained, because “courts still hold the final responsibility for enforcing\n\nthe [disability discrimination laws] . . . [and w]e must ensure that\n\neducational   institutions     are   not    ‘disguis[ing]   truly   discriminatory\n\nrequirements’ as academic decisions.” Wong, 192 F.3d at 817 (quoting\n\nZukle v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 166 F.3d 1041, 1048 (9th Cir. 1999)).\n\nOnly if we determine an institution has satisfied its obligation of detailed,\n\nindividualized inquiry is it appropriate to defer to the institution’s\n\njudgment regarding the integrity of its program. See Zukle, 166 F.3d at\n\n1048; see also Wong, 192 F.3d at 817–18; Pandazides v. Va.

To do otherwise\n\nreduces the term ‘otherwise qualified’ and any arbitrary set of\n\nrequirements to a tautology.”).\n\n      3. The appropriate level of deference here.    On appeal, Palmer\n\ncontends the commission erred, as a matter of law, in failing to grant\n\nappropriate deference to Palmer’s position regarding Cannon’s ability to\n\ncomplete the graduate program without fundamental alteration, and\n\nrelies on two distinct grounds.\n\n      First, Palmer relies on an earlier Iowa higher education case where\n\nwe explained we “ ‘may not override’ ” an institution’s professional\n\njudgment “ ‘unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted\n\nacademic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee\n\nresponsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.’ ” See North\n\nv. State, 400 N.W.2d 566, 571 (Iowa 1987) (quoting Ewing, 474 U.S. at\n\n225, 106 S. Ct. at 513, 88 L. Ed. 2d at 532). In North, however, we were\n\nnot faced with claims of disability discrimination under the ADA or\n\nICRA—instead, we considered breach of contract, tortious interference,\n\nand substantive due process and § 1983 civil rights claims. See id. at\n\n568–71.    We imported that principle of academic deference from a\n\nSupreme Court case that had also considered a due process claim, where\n\nthe Court had no occasion to consider the level of deference to be\n\naccorded in discrimination cases and had taken pains to note it was not\n\nconsidering claims beyond those before it. See Ewing, 474 U.S. at 225,\n\n106 S. Ct. at 513, 88 L. Ed. 2d at 532 (“It is important to remember that\n\nthis is not a case in which the procedures used by the University were\n\f                                   23\n\nunfair in any respect; quite the contrary is true. Nor can the Regents be\n\naccused of concealing nonacademic or constitutionally impermissible\n\nreasons for expelling Ewing[.]”); North, 400 N.W.2d at 571 (quoting\n\nEwing). Given that context, we are unpersuaded by Palmer’s reliance on\n\nNorth because, as numerous courts have explained, the application of\n\ndeference based on “accepted academic norms” is inadequate in the\n\ndisability discrimination context—courts must go significantly further in\n\ntheir inquiries to ensure inappropriate generalizations do not deny\n\nindividuals meaningful access to the benefits provided by educational\n\ninstitutions. Wynne, 932 F.2d at 26 (“[Ewing] was a context where no\n\nfederal statutory obligation impinged on the academic administrators;\n\ntheir freedom to make genuine academic decisions was untrammeled.”);\n\nStrathie, 716 F.2d at 231; Pushkin, 658 F.2d at 1383; see also\n\nGuckenberger v. Boston Univ., 8 F. Supp. 2d 82, 89 (D. Mass. 1998)\n\n(noting “a court should not determine that an academic decision is a\n\n‘substantial departure from accepted academic norms’ simply by\n\nconducting a head-count of other universities”); Laura F. Rothstein,\n\nHealth Care Professionals with Mental and Physical Impairments:\n\nDevelopments in Disability Discrimination Law, 41 St. Louis U. L.J. 973,\n\n995 (1997) [hereinafter Rothstein] (observing New Jersey federal court\n\n“recognized the importance of individualized determinations” in holding\n\nstate medical boards’ use of physical and mental health inquiries “as a\n\nscreening device” “were likely in violation of Title II of the ADA” and\n\nobserving “these judges were affirming the principle that discrimination\n\non the basis of disability cannot be justified by generalizations about\n\nsuch disabilities”).\n\n      Perhaps just as importantly for purposes of our analysis here, the\n\nSupreme Court in Ewing explained it was granting deference there only\n\f                                       24\n\nafter noting “the faculty’s decision was made conscientiously and with\n\ncareful deliberation, based on an evaluation of the entirety of Ewing’s\n\nacademic career.”         Ewing, 474 U.S. at 225, 106 S. Ct. at 513, 88\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 532. To the extent the Ewing deference analysis may inform\n\nour analysis in the context of disability discrimination, then, we note the\n\nEwing court’s emphasis on the extensive individualized investigation\n\nsuggests, much like courts actually considering disability discrimination\n\nclaims have, application of any deference may only be appropriate after\n\nan institution has established it has fulfilled its obligations of\n\nconscientious inquiry.      Id.; see also Edward N. Stoner II & J. Michael\n\nShowalter,     Judicial    Deference   to   Educational   Judgment:   Justice\n\nO’Connor’s Opinion in Grutter Reapplies Longstanding Principles, As\n\nShown by Rulings Involving College Students in the Eighteen Months\n\nBefore Grutter, 30 J.C. & U.L. 583, 611 (2004) (noting one principle\n\n“underlying judicial deference in ADA cases involving students is that\n\npersons trained to have educational judgment are not necessarily experts\n\nin disability accommodations”).\n\n      Palmer’s second ground for its contention the commission erred in\n\nfailing to extend appropriate deference—namely, that Palmer fulfilled its\n\nobligation of extensive individualized inquiry before denying Cannon the\n\nopportunity to participate in its program—is no more persuasive. Palmer\n\nadvances a two-pronged exposition of its investigation with respect to\n\nCannon.      First, Palmer recounts the numerous discussions its faculty\n\nhad in developing the technical standards it seeks to apply here, points\n\nto the evidence it presented below supporting its initial creation and\n\nadoption of the standards, and notes the “standards are based upon\n\n[Palmer’s] teaching experiences with disabled students including those\n\nvisually impaired.” Second, Palmer explains the “technical standards are\n\f                                    25\n\napplied on a case-by-case basis depending upon whether or not the\n\ndisabled individual meets those standards.” Based on this exposition, we\n\ncannot conclude the commission’s findings regarding Palmer’s approach\n\nwere unsupported by substantial evidence or that the commission erred\n\nin determining Palmer failed to advance evidence of an inquiry\n\nresembling anything like the fact-specific, individualized inquiry required\n\nby the caselaw.\n\n      On the first point, Palmer appears to concede it seeks to invoke its\n\nstandards in Cannon’s case as an “essential requirement” based on no\n\ninvestigation at all of Cannon’s condition or ability to perform with a\n\nreader or the various technologies he noted he had or could have at his\n\ndisposal.   Instead, Palmer would invoke the standards based on its\n\nexperiences with past individuals with disabilities.          That strict,\n\ngeneralized invocation of Palmer’s technical standard falls far short, we\n\nthink, of the conscientious, interactive, student-specific inquiry required\n\nby the caselaw. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 819 (“Dean Lewis failed to\n\ndiscuss Wong’s proposal with any of the professionals who had worked\n\nwith Wong to pinpoint his disability and help him develop skills to cope\n\nwith it.”); Laura Rothstein, Disability Law and Higher Education: A Road\n\nMap for Where We’ve Been and Where We May Be Heading, 63 Md. L.\n\nRev. 122, 142 (2004) (“In determining that it would not be a substantial\n\nalteration to accommodate Casey Martin by allowing the use of a golf cart\n\nin professional golf tournament play, the [Supreme Court] emphasized\n\nthe importance of an individualized assessment. The Court noted that\n\nfor Martin the use of a cart was not a fundamental alteration because the\n\nessential aspect of fatigue was still present for him. The Court added\n\nthat other requests for golf carts would have to be individually assessed\n\nto ensure that others would not be unfairly advantaged.”); see also\n\f                                       26\n\nD’Amico v.

See\n\nCase W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1391 (Resnick, J., dissenting)\n\n(“[B]lanket requirements are not ipso facto bona fide.

Palmer’s generalized application did little\n\nto satisfy its obligation of individualized investigation here.9       See, e.g.,\n\n      9We   think it important to emphasize here Palmer’s apparent concession that\nprovision of Cannon’s requested accommodations would not fundamentally alter its\n\f                                           27\n\nWynne, 932 F.2d at 26 (explaining institution must seek means of\n\nreasonably accommodating individual and “[i]f the institution submits\n\nundisputed facts demonstrating that the relevant officials within the\n\ninstitution considered alternative means . . . the court could rule as a\n\nmatter of law that the institution had met its duty”); see also Pandazides,\n\n946 F.2d at 349 (“The district court must look behind the qualifications.\n\nTo do otherwise reduces the term ‘otherwise qualified’ and any arbitrary\n\nset of requirements to a tautology.”); Bentivegna v.

More\n\nspecifically, the commission offered substantial evidence in support of\n\nthe following findings: Palmer engaged in minimal interaction with\n\nCannon; Palmer failed to investigate, with or without Cannon, how he\n\nmight actually use a reader given a specific task; Palmer failed to\n\n\n___________________\ncurriculum until the fifth trimester may constitute probative evidence of the\nreasonableness of duties to both provide and specifically investigate these\naccommodations in the preceding trimesters. See, e.g., Lane v. Pena, 867 F. Supp.\n1050, 1070 (D.D.C. 1994) (“Moreover, the Defendants admit that such requirements, if\nany, do not even apply to students such as Lane who have not yet reached their third\nyear. Consequently, the Defendants cannot simply point to that statute and definitively\nconclude that maintaining eligibility for such a commission is an essential requirement\nto remaining at the USMMA and that, therefore, their actions were consistent with\nSection 504.”), vacated in part on other grounds, 518 U.S. 187, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135\nL. Ed. 2d 486 (1996); Alicia Ouellette, Patients to Peers: Barriers and Opportunities for\nDoctors with Disabilities, 13 Nev. L.J. 645, 666 (2013) (“The available evidence indicates\nthat medical schools graduate more medical students with sensory and motor\ndisabilities than they admit, suggesting that they make accommodations for students\nwho develop specific disabilities after they have started their course of study.”).\n\f                                         28\n\ninvestigate with the requisite depth how other former blind students had\n\nperformed specific tasks in the past; Palmer failed to investigate reports\n\nof successful blind students at other schools and successful blind\n\nchiropractic     practitioners;   Palmer      failed   to    investigate    reports   of\n\ntechnologies used successfully elsewhere in school and professional\n\nsettings; and Palmer failed to engage individuals with experience\n\nteaching Cannon or other blind individuals, among other failures. Given\n\nthose findings, and given the principle from the relevant caselaw that an\n\ninstitution’s academic judgments are owed minimal, if any, deference in\n\nthe absence of a showing the institution has fulfilled its investigative\n\nobligations, we cannot conclude the commission has erroneously\n\ninterpreted the applicable law on deference here.                    See Iowa Code\n\n§ 17A.19(10)(c); Wong, 192 F.3d at 818 (“We do not defer to the academic\n\ninstitution’s decision in the present case because the record that the\n\nUniversity presented falls short of [the requirement of in-depth,\n\nindividual analysis].”).\n\n      4. The commission’s fundamental alteration analysis: specific\n\nfundamental alteration principles and their application here.                 Because\n\nPalmer has failed to establish it met the legal prerequisites for deference\n\nto its determination accommodation would constitute fundamental\n\nalteration here, we turn to the commission’s analysis of the fundamental\n\nalteration inquiry.    Cf. Wong, 192 F.3d at 819–20 (noting, in different\n\nappellate posture, court would “not defer to the institution’s decision”—\n\ninstead, it would “examine the rejection of Wong’s request for an eight-\n\nweek reading period de novo”).\n\n      At   the    outset,   we    note   numerous           courts   have    explained\n\ndeterminations of reasonable accommodation and fundamental alteration\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA generally require flexible, fact-specific\n\f                                    29\n\ninquiries and are typically resolved as questions of fact.       See, e.g.,\n\nHaschmann v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 151 F.3d 591, 601 (7th Cir. 1998)\n\n(“The reasonableness of a requested accommodation is a question of\n\nfact.”); Long v. Howard Univ., 439 F. Supp. 2d 68, 80 (D.D.C. 2006)\n\n(“Based on the evidence proffered by the parties thus far, whether the\n\nmodifications would in fact constitute a fundamental alteration is a\n\nquestion requiring jury resolution.”); see also Staron v. McDonald’s Corp.,\n\n51 F.3d 353, 356 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Although neither the ADA nor the\n\ncourts have defined the precise contours of the test for reasonableness, it\n\nis clear that the determination of whether a particular modification is\n\n‘reasonable’ involves a fact-specific, case-by-case inquiry that considers\n\namong other factors, the effectiveness of the modification in light of the\n\nnature of the disability in question and the cost to the organization that\n\nwould implement it.”); Crowder v. Kitagawa, 81 F.3d 1480, 1486 (9th\n\nCir. 1996) (“[W]e have held that the determination of what constitutes\n\nreasonable modification is highly fact-specific, requiring case-by-case\n\ninquiry.”); Zimple v.

But see Sande L. Buhai, Practice Makes\n\nPerfect: Reasonable Accommodation of Law Students with Disabilities in\n\nClinical Placements, 36 San Diego L. Rev. 137, 146 (1999) (“In\n\ndetermining whether a function is essential, courts must address each\n\ncase individually.   Whether the plaintiff can perform the essential job\n\nfunctions with reasonable accommodations is a mixed question of law\n\nand fact, which involves primarily a factual inquiry.”).\n\n      Before examining the commission’s findings regarding fundamental\n\nalteration, however, we think it prudent to note several principles courts\n\nand commentators have developed to aid the fact finder in determining\n\nwhether an accommodation is reasonable or might constitute a\n\nfundamental alteration in a given case. See Easley by Easley v. Snider,\n\n36 F.3d 297, 302 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting courts “cannot rely” on\n\ninstitution’s characterization of its program, because the institution “may\n\nattempt to define the benefit in a way that ‘effectively denies otherwise\n\nhandicapped individuals the meaningful access to which they are\n\nentitled’ ” (quoting Alexander, 469 U.S. at 301, 105 S. Ct. at 720, 83 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 672)).     Courts considering education discrimination claims\n\nhave often looked to fundamental alteration considerations from the\n\nemployment context for guidance. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 820–21.\n\f                                     31\n\nImplementing regulations for the ADA’s employment provision suggest\n\ncourts consider several factors in determining whether particular duties\n\nconstitute fundamental or essential functions of the job. See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1630.2(n)(3); see also Moritz v. Frontier Airlines, Inc., 147 F.3d 784, 787\n\n(8th Cir. 1998). Those factors include, among others: job descriptions\n\nprepared for advertising or used when interviewing applicants for the job;\n\nthe amount of time spent on the job performing the function in question;\n\nconsequences of not requiring the person to perform the function; the\n\nwork experience of persons who have held the job; and/or the current\n\nwork experience of persons in similar jobs. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see\n\nalso Rothstein, 41 St. Louis U. L.J. at 976–77 (“The function may be\n\nessential because that function is the purpose of the position, because\n\nthere are a limited number of employees among whom the function can\n\nbe distributed, or because the function is highly specialized and the\n\nindividual was hired specifically because of his or her expertise in that\n\nspecialty.”).\n\n      Applying these “essential functions” principles from employment\n\ncases, numerous courts in the education context have found the fact that\n\ninstitutions have previously granted accommodations the same as or\n\nsimilar to the accommodation at issue persuasive evidence the\n\naccommodation is reasonable and does not fundamentally alter the\n\ninstitution’s curriculum. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 820 (“The fact that\n\nthe school previously made the exact modification . . . that Wong\n\nrequested . . . is certainly persuasive evidence from which a [fact finder]\n\ncould conclude that the accommodation was reasonable.”); Zukle, 166\n\nF.3d at 1048–49 (considering student’s request for eight weeks off\n\nbetween medical school rotations and noting institution’s previous\n\ndecisions to grant requests for decelerated schedule were probative of\n\f                                    32\n\nreasonableness); Matthews v. NCAA, 179 F. Supp. 2d 1209, 1226–27\n\n(E.D. Wash. 2001) (“Most notably, the NCAA already has granted Plaintiff\n\ntwo waivers, including one waiver of [its rule requiring student-athletes\n\nto earn seventy-five percent of their annual credit hours during the\n\nregular academic year]. The Court finds it difficult, particularly in light\n\nof the individualized inquiry required by [PGA Tour, Inc. v.] Martin, [532\n\nU.S. 661, 121 S. Ct. 1879, 149 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2001),] to see how granting\n\na third waiver to Plaintiff would fundamentally alter the NCAA’s purpose,\n\nwhen the first two waivers did not.”); see also Forbes v. St. Thomas Univ.,\n\nInc., 768 F. Supp. 2d 1222, 1234 (S.D.

In so doing, these courts have applied the general\n\nprinciple from the ADA caselaw that an institution will bear a\n\n“particularly heavy” burden in establishing an accommodation is\n\nunreasonable where other institutions have provided accommodation for\n\nthe same deficit without significant issue.     Am. Council of the Blind v.\n\nPaulson, 525 F.3d 1256, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (“[B]ecause other currency\n\nsystems accommodate the needs of the visually impaired, the [Secretary\n\nof the Treasury’s] burden in demonstrating that implementing an\n\naccommodation would be unduly burdensome is particularly heavy.”);\n\nsee also Tamara v. El Camino Hosp., 964 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1084–85\n\n(N.D. Cal. 2013) (“Tamara has provided the service animal policies for a\n\nnumber of stand-alone psychiatric hospitals and individual wards within\n\ngeneral hospitals, whose policies allow for the admittance of service dogs.\n\n. . .

See,\n\ne.g., Lane v. Pena, 867 F. Supp. 1050, 1070 (D.D.C. 1994) (“[G]iven that\n\nmany people with diabetes have obtained merchant marine licenses, and\n\nat least 50 people with diabetes mellitus are currently operating under a\n\nmerchant marine license at sea, the Court finds that the rigid naval\n\nreserve requirements are not ‘essential’ to at least one purpose of the\n\nprogram, namely, training officers for the merchant marine.”), vacated in\n\npart on other grounds, 518 U.S. 187, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486\n\n(1996). Courts have also looked to an individual’s past academic success\n\nand considered whether later professional licensure actually requires\n\nperformance of the institution’s proposed function. Shaywitz v. Am. Bd.\n\nof Psychiatry & Neurology, 675 F. Supp. 2d 376, 390–91 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)\n\n(“Given Shaywitz’s alleged competence and success as a medical student,\n\nresident, and fellow, and that the Board has largely eliminated its Part II\n\nOral Exam, the Court finds it plausible that certifying Shaywitz without\n\nhis having to pass the live-patient portion of the Part II Oral Exam, based\n\non the facts as alleged at the pleading stage, would not ‘fundamentally\n\nalter the nature of’ the Board-certification process.” (Internal citations\n\nomitted.)).\n\n      With those propositions in mind, we turn to the commission’s\n\nfindings with respect to fundamental alteration.         We note we are\n\nconcerned on appeal with two principles regarding the commission’s\n\nfindings. First, in reviewing the commission’s factual findings we must\n\f                                        34\n\ndetermine merely whether the evidence “supports the findings actually\n\nmade” by the commission and need not concern ourselves with whether\n\nthe evidence might also support a different finding. See Meyer v. IBP,\n\nInc., 710 N.W.2d 213, 218 (Iowa 2006).              Second, in reviewing the\n\ncommission’s application of the law to the facts, we may look to other\n\ngrounds of error, such as erroneous interpretation of law, irrational\n\nreasoning, or failure to consider relevant facts, in determining whether\n\nthe commission has abused its discretion in its application. Id. at 218–\n\n19.\n\n      As noted above, the commission made several noteworthy findings\n\nin support of its determination Cannon’s proposed accommodation was\n\nreasonable. First, the commission found the record revealed no evidence\n\nstate licensing boards required sight, or interpretation of radiographic\n\nimages in precisely the manner required by Palmer, for purposes of\n\nlicensure.       Second,    Palmer     presented    no   evidence    the   course\n\nmodifications and waivers it grants at its California campus have\n\njeopardized its accreditation with national accrediting bodies. Third, at\n\nleast two blind students had graduated previously from Palmer’s\n\nDavenport       campus     and   are    currently   licensed   and     practicing\n\nsuccessfully.\n\n      Palmer asserts, however, that it cannot accommodate Cannon, and\n\nthe commission’s decision must therefore be reversed as a matter of law,\n\nbecause all chiropractic students must be able to see radiographic\n\nimages. We find this contention unpersuasive. Palmer itself concedes at\n\nleast twenty percent of current chiropractic practitioners practice without\n\n“the ability to take plain film radiographs in their office[],” and concedes\n\nthe size of the fraction is currently on the rise. These concessions are at\n\nodds with the contention radiographic image interpretation—regardless\n\f                                     35\n\nwhether in the narrow sense Palmer has defined it or even the more\n\ngeneral sense of having the equipment available—must constitute an\n\n“essential” component of the education or practice of chiropractic.\n\nFurthermore, as Palmer has noted, frequent consultation between\n\nchiropractors and radiology specialists is “oftentimes” “part of the clinical\n\npractice [of chiropractic].”\n\n        We also find it instructive that numerous medical schools,\n\nostensibly recognizing these realities, have admitted blind students and\n\nmade accommodation in recent years. See, e.g., Sarah M. Eickmeyer et\n\nal., North American Medical Schools’ Experience with and Approaches to\n\nthe Needs of Students with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, 87 Acad.\n\nMed. 567, 569–70 (2012) (finding at least sixty partially- or totally-blind\n\nstudents matriculated at U.S. medical schools between 2001 and 2010\n\nand noting schools have provided accommodations ranging from “[an]\n\nassistant for observation” to “[an] assistant for physical exam[ination]”).\n\nThe accommodations made by these schools, coupled with Palmer’s own\n\nprevious accommodations, weigh particularly heavily against Palmer’s\n\nfundamental alteration defense. See Am. Council of the Blind, 525 F.3d\n\nat 1272; Tamara, 964 F. Supp. 2d at 1084–85.               Recent proposed\n\nrulemaking by the Department of Justice bolsters this position, as it\n\nseeks    “to   ensure   that   medical    diagnostic   equipment,   including\n\nexamination tables, examination chairs, . . . and other imaging\n\nequipment used by health care providers for diagnostic purposes are\n\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.”          Medical\n\nDiagnostic Equipment Accessibility Standards, 77 Fed.

Demetrius Moutsiakis & Thomas Polisoto,\nReassessing Physical Disability Among Graduating US Medical Students, 89 Am. J.\nPhysical Med. & Rehabilitation 923, 926–27 (2010) (noting trend of steadily declining\nmedical school graduation rates over the last four decades for individuals with physical\nand sensory disabilities and recommending schools “remove the requirement of the\nundifferentiated graduate to allow [individuals] with, for example, blindness to train in\nother capacities such as preventive medicine and public health”).\n\f                                          37\n\nestablish provision of Cannon’s requested accommodations would\n\nconstitute fundamental alteration of its curriculum on these facts. See\n\nIowa Code § 17A.19(10)(c), (f), (i), (j), (l).\n\n       IV. Conclusion.\n\n       We conclude substantial evidence supports the commission’s\n\nfactual findings and the commission has not erred in interpreting the\n\nrelevant laws or applying them to the facts at issue here. We therefore\n\nreverse the decision of the district court and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to affirm the commission’s order.\n\n       REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n       All justices concur except Waterman and Mansfield, JJ., who\n\ndissent.\n\f                                        38\n                                      #12–0924, Palmer Coll. v. Davenport CRC\n\nWATERMAN, Justice (dissenting).\n\n        I respectfully dissent.    The majority elevates political correctness\n\nover common sense.          Obscured in its lengthy decision is the fact our\n\ncourt and the Davenport Civil Rights Commission are requiring Palmer\n\nCollege of Chiropractic to permit a student, blind since birth, to interpret\n\nX-rays based on what an untrained reader tells him the X-ray films\n\ndepict and treat patients through vigorous spinal adjustments relying on\n\nthat    interpretation.       Aaron    Cannon   failed   to   prove   such   an\n\naccommodation is reasonable. As the district court recognized, “vision is\n\nindispensable for several critical functions that chiropractic students and\n\nprofessionals must perform, such as reviewing X-rays, analyzing\n\nradiographs, and assessing physical symptoms.” I defer to no one in my\n\nadmiration for Cannon and his blind attorney and the challenges they\n\nboth have overcome, but there is a point at which an accommodation\n\nceases to be reasonable, and it has been met here.\n\n        What is next?        Are we going to require the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration to hire blind air traffic controllers, relying on assistants to\n\ntell them what is appearing on the screen? The principle is the same\n\nhere.    A misinterpreted X-ray could lead to improper treatment and\n\nlifelong paralysis.       X-ray interpretation requires training and skilled\n\njudgment to reach correct conclusions based on shades and shadows of\n\ncomplex bony structures.          That is why many physicians with twenty–\n\ntwenty vision choose to outsource interpretation of X-rays to radiologists.\n\nIt is ludicrous to override Palmer’s academic decision and require it to\n\npermit a blind person to interpret X-rays for patient treatment based on\n\nwhat someone else claims he or she is seeing.\n\f                                   39\n\n      The majority’s intrusion into academic judgment on professional\n\nhealth care standards is unprecedented. No other court in the country\n\nhas forced an academic institution to allow a blind student to interpret\n\nX-rays relying on an untrained sighted assistant. The majority fails to\n\nconfront the well-reasoned decision of the Ohio Supreme Court applying\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–797b, to\n\nuphold a medical school’s decision to deny admission to a blind student\n\nwho, like Cannon, requested a personal assistant to read X-rays and\n\nhelp with clinical examinations.   Ohio Civil Rights Comm’n v. Case W.\n\nReserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d 1376, 1383, 1386 (Ohio 1996). The district\n\ncourt correctly followed Case Western Reserve University in concluding\n\nsuch an accommodation was unreasonable and would fundamentally\n\nalter Palmer’s program.    I would affirm.   Our court and the local\n\ncommission comprised of laypersons have no business second-guessing\n\nthe professional academic judgment of our nation’s leading college of\n\nchiropractic.   Palmer has reasonably concluded that its graduates\n\npersonally must be able to see and interpret X-rays. A student who has\n\nnever seen a spine cannot reliably interpret spinal X-rays based on what\n\nsomeone else tells him the films show.\n\n      I would follow the Ohio Supreme Court’s reasoning in Case\n\nWestern, the facts of which are strikingly similar to this case. A blind\n\nstudent, Cheryl Fischer, applied to medical school at Case Western\n\nReserve University. Id. at 1379. To evaluate applicants, Case Western\n\napplied technical standards promulgated by the Association of American\n\nMedical Colleges (AAMC), which required that candidates must be able to\n\n“observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand.”   Id. at\n\n1379–80.    The AAMC technical standards explained, “The use of a\n\ntrained intermediary means that a candidate’s judgment must be\n\f                                    40\n\nmediated by someone else’s power of selection and observation.” Id. at\n\n1380. Case Western “concluded that a blind student would be unable to\n\ncomplete the requirements of the medical school program.”          Id.   An\n\nassociate professor of surgery at Case Western emphasized that “Fischer\n\nwould be unable to exercise independent judgment when reading an\n\nX-ray, unable to start an I.V., and unable to effectively participate in the\n\nsurgery clerkship.” Id. (noting further that Fischer would be unable to\n\n“identify tissue and organ structures through a microscope” or “observe\n\nhow such structures are affected by disease”).           “In the[] medical\n\neducators’ opinions, the use of an intermediary would interfere with the\n\nstudent’s exercise of independent judgment—a crucial part of developing\n\ndiagnostic skills.” Id. at 1387.\n\n      The Ohio Supreme Court deferred to Case Western’s academic\n\njudgment, as we should defer to Palmer’s.       The Ohio Supreme Court\n\nemphasized that an educational institution is in the best position to\n\ndetermine whether a student will be able to successfully complete the\n\nprogram:\n\n      [Case Western]’s decision not to modify its program by\n      waiving course requirements or permitting intermediaries to\n      read X-rays or perform physical examinations is an academic\n      decision. Courts are particularly ill-equipped to evaluate\n      academic requirements of educational institutions. As a\n      result, considerable judicial deference must be paid to\n      academic decisions made by the institution itself unless it is\n      shown that the standards serve no purpose other than to\n      deny an education to the handicapped.\n\nId. at 1386 (citations omitted).      Deferring to the AAMC technical\n\nstandards and the medical educators’ opinions, the court acknowledged\n\nthat waiving the requirement to read an X-ray—or using an intermediary\n\nto perform that function—would fundamentally alter the nature of Case\n\nWestern’s program. Id. at 1387; see also Cunningham v. Univ. of N.M. Bd.\n\f                                   41\n\nof Regents, 531 F. App’x 909, 919–20 (10th Cir. 2013) (affirming\n\ndismissal of vision-related disability claims by medical student, noting\n\n“[t]o the extent [the plaintiff] avers UNM should have changed its\n\nprogram   requirements,    such    an     accommodation   would   not   be\n\nreasonable”). The Case Western court further recognized that providing a\n\nblind student additional supervision and waiving courses for the student\n\nis not required under the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nSoutheastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 410, 99 S. Ct.\n\n2361, 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980, 990 (1979), when such accommodations\n\nwould not change the fact that the student will be unable to satisfy the\n\ndegree requirements. Case W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1386–87.\n\n      Our case is also analogous to Davis. In Davis, the United States\n\nSupreme Court upheld a nursing college’s decision to deny admission to\n\nan applicant with a hearing disability, holding the law “does not\n\nencompass the kind of curricular changes that would be necessary to\n\naccommodate [the applicant] in the nursing program.” Davis, 442 U.S.\n\nat 409, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990. Similarly to the nursing\n\napplicant, Cannon “would not receive even a rough equivalent of the\n\ntraining” Palmer normally gives.        Id. at 410, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990.   “Such a fundamental alteration in the nature of a\n\nprogram is far more than the ‘modification’ the regulation requires.” Id.\n\nLike the proposed accommodations for the deaf applicant in Davis, it\n\nappears unlikely “Cannon could benefit from any affirmative action that\n\nthe regulation reasonably could be interpreted as requiring.” Id. at 409,\n\n99 S. Ct. at 2368, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990.          Therefore, Palmer, “with\n\nprudence,” could not allow Cannon to graduate from the program. Id. at\n\n409, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990.\n\f                                       42\n\n      As the majority notes, many practicing chiropractors lack X-ray\n\nequipment and rely on other professional radiologists or chiropractors to\n\ninterpret their patients’ X-rays.   Cannon, however, is not asking for a\n\nwaiver to allow him to rely on the interpretation of a qualified expert.\n\nRather, his requested accommodation is to interpret X-rays himself,\n\nbased on what an untrained sighted assistant tells him. In any event,\n\nthe law does not obligate Palmer to waive program requirements. The\n\nplaintiff in Case Western argued the school should waive certain medical-\n\nschool skill requirements because she planned to pursue a practice in\n\npsychiatry, in which those skills were unnecessary. 666 N.E.2d at 1386.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating:\n\n             The goal of medical schools is not to produce\n      specialized degrees but rather general degrees in medicine\n      which signify that the holder is a physician prepared for\n      further training in any area of medicine. As such, graduates\n      must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad\n      variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum\n      of patient care. All students, regardless of whether they\n      intend to practice in psychiatry or radiology, are required to\n      complete a variety of course requirements, including\n      rotations in pediatrics, gynecology, and surgery.\n\nId. at 1387.    In the same way, it is Palmer’s prerogative to decide the\nskills necessary to graduate with a chiropractic degree.      A student’s\n\nchoice to focus his or her practice on certain skills to the exclusion of\n\nothers does not exempt that student from successfully completing degree\n\nrequirements.\n\n      The majority recognizes that it is appropriate to give deference to\n\nan institution’s professional or academic judgment, yet refuses to defer to\n\nPalmer because the commission concluded Palmer did not seek out\n\n“suitable   means    of   reasonably    accommodating”   individuals   with\n\ndisabilities. I disagree that Palmer’s investigation fell short. Palmer met\n\nwith Cannon multiple times, met Iowa Department of the Blind\n\f                                       43\n\nrepresentatives, and expressed a willingness to continue the dialogue.\n\nNothing in the record supports a conclusion that further investigation by\n\nPalmer would have found a way for Cannon to personally see and\n\ninterpret X-rays. Technological advancements may one day allow blind\n\nindividuals to interpret X-rays.      No such “app” exists today.         Cannon\n\nsimply   has   not   satisfied   his     burden     to   prove    a     reasonable\n\naccommodation is possible regarding X-ray interpretation. See Boelman\n\nv. Manson State Bank, 522 N.W.2d 73, 80 (Iowa 1994) (“[T]he plaintiff\n\nmust produce enough evidence to make a facial showing that reasonable\n\naccommodation is possible.”).         The majority would require Palmer to\n\njump through additional hoops to establish what the record already\n\nmakes    clear—Cannon        cannot     satisfy   the    chiropractic     program\n\nrequirement that students master X-ray interpretation.\n\n      We should defer to Palmer’s conclusion that accommodating\n\nCannon would fundamentally alter its chiropractic program. In North v.\n\nState, we recognized “ ‘[c]onsiderations of profound importance counsel\n\nrestrained judicial review of the substance of academic decisions.’ ” 400\n\nN.W.2d 566, 571 (Iowa 1987) (quoting Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing,\n\n474 U.S. 214, 225, 106 S. Ct. 507, 513, 88 L. Ed. 2d 523, 532 (1985)).\n\nThough North did not involve a claim under the ADA, the principle of\n\ndeference expressed in that opinion is a truism with broad application.\n\nWhen presented with ADA claims, courts “have overwhelmingly extended\n\nsome level of deference to schools’ professional judgments regarding\n\nstudents’   qualifications   when      addressing    disability   discrimination\n\nclaims.” Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 463\n\n(4th Cir. 2012) (collecting cases and noting, “[b]ecause we are . . . at a\n\ncomparative disadvantage in determining whether Halpern is qualified to\n\ncontinue in the Doctor of Medicine program and whether his proposed\n\f                                    44\n\naccommodations would effect substantial modifications to the Medical\n\nSchool’s program, we accord great respect to Wake Forest’s professional\n\njudgments on these issues”). I would follow the United States Supreme\n\nCourt’s guidance: “When judges are asked to review the substance of a\n\ngenuinely academic decision . . . they should show great respect for the\n\nfaculty’s professional judgment.” Ewing, 474 U.S. at 225, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n513, 88 L. Ed. 2d at 532.\n\n      The majority relies on Wong v. Regents of University of California,\n\n192 F.3d 807 (9th Cir. 1999), and Wynne v. Tufts University School of\n\nMedicine (Wynne I), 932 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1991), but the standards\n\nelucidated in those cases favor Palmer.    The Court of Appeals for the\n\nNinth Circuit recognized in Wong that:\n\n            Faculty members and administrators of a professional\n      school are unquestionably in the best position to set\n      standards for the institution and to establish curricular\n      requirements that fulfill the school’s purpose of training\n      students for the work that lies ahead of them.\n\n192 F.3d at 825–26.         The court noted deference to an academic\n\ninstitution is inappropriate only if the institution has not “carefully\n\nconsider[ed] each disabled student’s particular limitations and analyz[ed]\n\nwhether and how it might accommodate that student in a way that\n\nwould allow the student to complete the school's program without\n\nlowering academic standards.” Id. at 826. The court declined to defer to\n\nthe University of California’s decision to dismiss a student because “the\n\nrecord contain[ed] facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat the school made th[at] decision[] for arbitrary reasons unrelated to\n\nits academic standards.”     Id.   In contrast, the record shows Palmer\n\ncarefully considered whether it could accommodate Cannon’s disability\n\nwith a sighted assistant to look at X-rays.       Palmer ultimately and\n\f                                    45\n\nreasonably concluded it could not.       No reasonable fact finder could\n\nconclude Palmer’s decision was unrelated to academic standards.\n\n      In Wynne I, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit set forth the\n\nappropriate analysis “to assess whether an academic institution\n\nadequately has explored the availability of reasonable accommodations\n\nfor a handicapped individual.” 932 F.2d at 26.\n\n      If the institution submits undisputed facts demonstrating\n      that the relevant officials within the institution considered\n      alternative means, their feasibility, cost and effect on the\n      academic program, and came to a rationally justifiable\n      conclusion that the available alternatives would result either\n      in lowering academic standards or requiring substantial\n      program alteration, the court could rule as a matter of law\n      that the institution had met its duty of seeking reasonable\n      accommodation.\n\nId. (noting “[i]n most cases, we believe that, as in the qualified immunity\n\ncontext, the issue of whether the facts alleged by a university support its\n\nclaim that it has met its duty of reasonable accommodation will be a\n\n“ ‘purely legal one’ ” (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528 n.9,\n\n105 S. Ct. 2806, 2816 n.9, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411, 426 n.9 (1985))).         The\n\nstudent in Wynne I asked Tufts University School of Medicine to\n\naccommodate his disability by using a different testing method than\n\nmultiple choice to evaluate his progress. Id. at 22. The court concluded\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to grant summary judgment in favor of\n\nTufts because the record did not demonstrate the school considered\n\npossible alternatives or discussed the unique qualities of multiple choice\n\nexaminations.    Id. at 28.   The court therefore remanded the case for\n\nfurther fact-finding. Id.\n\n      Following remand, Tufts provided additional evidence explaining\n\nwhy “ ‘the multiple choice format provides the fairest way to test the\n\nstudents’ mastery of the subject matter of biochemistry.’ ”      Wynne v.\n\f                                     46\n\nTufts Univ. Sch. of Med. (Wynne II), 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nWith the additional evidence, the district court concluded Tufts met the\n\nstandard elucidated in Wynne I and entered summary judgment in favor\n\nof Tufts. Wynne II, 976 F.2d at 793. The student again appealed to the\n\nFirst Circuit.   See id.   The Wynne II court acknowledged that “Tufts’\n\nexplanations, though plausible, are not necessarily ironclad.” Id. at 795.\n\nBut, the court emphasized “the point is not whether a medical school is\n\n‘right’ or ‘wrong’ in making program-related decisions.” Id. Rather, “[t]he\n\npoint is that Tufts, after undertaking a diligent assessment of the\n\navailable options,” decided “no further accommodation could be made\n\nwithout imposing an undue (and injurious) hardship on the academic\n\nprogram.” Id. The First Circuit therefore affirmed summary judgment\n\nfor Tufts, stating “the undisputed facts contained in the expanded\n\nrecord,   when    considered   in   the   deferential   light   that    academic\n\ndecisionmaking deserves, meet the required standard.”                  Id. at 796\n\n(emphasis added) (citation omitted).        Likewise, Palmer has provided\n\ncompelling explanations why accommodating Cannon’s disability with a\n\nsighted assistant to look at X-rays for him would fundamentally alter the\n\nchiropractic program. We owe deference to Palmer’s explanations.\n\n      In order to accommodate Cannon, Palmer would have had to lower\n\nits academic standards—something the law does not require. See Wong,\n\n192 F.3d at 826 (noting an institution is responsible for “carefully\n\nconsidering each disabled student’s particular limitations and analyzing\n\nwhether and how it might accommodate that student in a way that\n\nwould allow the student to complete the school’s program without\n\nlowering academic standards” (emphasis added)); Wynne II, 976 F.2d at\n\n795 (deferring to Tufts’ conclusion that accommodating the student\n\n“would require substantial program alterations, result in lowering\n\f                                     47\n\nacademic standards, and devalue Tufts’ end product—highly trained\n\nphysicians carrying the prized credential of a Tufts degree”).         As a\n\nprofessor explained, the Palmer radiology curriculum has three primary\n\ngoals: to teach students to (1) produce diagnostic-quality X-rays, (2)\n\ninterpret and glean clinical information off of X-ray film, and (3) apply the\n\ninformation in a clinical sense for case management. The district court\n\nsummarized      how   Cannon’s    proposed     accommodation—a       sighted\n\nassistant to describe X-rays to him—would work: “Cannon asks a series\n\nof questions to the assistant, gradually posing those questions more and\n\nmore specifically as needed in order to obtain the information necessary\n\nfor him to visualize the displayed image or text.” A professor explained\n\nwhy   this   accommodation      would     compromise   Palmer’s    academic\n\nrequirements:\n\n      I haven’t been able to determine how a sighted assistant\n      could give information to the blind student that would not\n      compromise [the student’s] independent judgment of those\n      films. [For the student to ask] the question, is the film too\n      dark or is the film too light, immediately [the reader’s]\n      answer to that is a judgment and it compromises the\n      student’s ability to independently make that judgment\n      themselves.\n             ....\n             And so if a student is told . . . the film is too dark,\n      somebody has already made the judgment for them . . . . If\n      they are told the patient is not aligned or they ask the\n      question is the patient aligned and the answer is no, then\n      that, once again, leverages their independent judgment as to\n      whether or not the film needs to be repeated and/or what\n      needs to be done to make the film better.\n\nEssentially, a sighted assistant would have to interpret the X-rays and\n\nthen relay that interpretation to Cannon; Cannon would not be\n\ninterpreting the X-rays himself.        In light of these realities, Palmer\n\ndetermined that Cannon would be unable to attain the goals of the\n\f                                     48\n\nradiology curriculum. Palmer has demonstrated that a sighted assistant\n\nis not a reasonable accommodation.\n\n      It is not as if Palmer adopted the technical standards lightly or did\n\nnot consider Cannon’s arguments for why he should be admitted.\n\nPalmer has carefully considered the skills necessary to become a\n\nchiropractor and determined that the ability to read X-rays is integral.\n\nAs one Palmer professor explained, the technical standards Palmer\n\nadopted   are   “clearly   based   from   an    educational   perspective   on\n\nindividuals that we have interacted with in the curriculum and what has\n\nworked and what has not worked.”               Palmer adopted its technical\n\nstandards in order to comply with the Council on Chiropractic\n\nEducation’s national accreditation standards, further supporting the\n\nschool’s conclusion that vision is necessary to earn a chiropractic degree.\n\nSee Case W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1379–80, 1385–86 (deferring to\n\nCase Western’s application of technical standards promulgated by the\n\nAAMC).    As noted, Palmer met with Cannon multiple times, met with\n\nIowa Department of the Blind representatives, and expressed a\n\nwillingness to continue the dialogue. Cf. Wong, 192 F.3d at 819, 821\n\n(reversing summary judgment in favor of university when “Dean Lewis\n\nfailed to discuss Wong’s proposal with any of the professionals who had\n\nworked with Wong to pinpoint his disability and help him develop skills\n\nto cope with it.”).   Yet, Palmer remained convinced that the program\n\nmodifications necessary to accommodate Cannon would fundamentally\n\nalter its program.\n\n      I do not find it legally significant that Palmer modifies its course\n\nrequirements and grants certain waivers for blind students enrolled at its\n\nCalifornia campus. California law mandates these accommodations by\n\nstatute. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 1000–8 (West, Westlaw through ch.\n\f                                    49\n\n25 of 2014 Reg. Sess., Res. ch. 1 of 2013–2014 Ex. Sess., and all\n\npropositions on the 6/3/2014 ballot) (stating “[n]o blind person shall be”\n\ndenied (1) admission to a chiropractic school, (2) the right to take a\n\nchiropractic exam, (3) a chiropractic diploma, (4) admission into an\n\nexamination for a state chiropractic license, or (5) a chiropractic license\n\n“on the ground that he is blind”). That California statute does not apply\n\nextraterritorially in Iowa. Unlike California, the Iowa legislature has not\n\nenacted a statute requiring Palmer to waive requirements for blind\n\npersons. Simply because another state imposes such accommodations\n\non an institution does not mean that those accommodations are not\n\nfundamental alterations of Palmer’s Iowa academic program. Palmer has\n\nprovided   ample    evidence    supporting    why    Cannon’s    proposed\n\naccommodation would fundamentally alter its program, and our inquiry\n\nshould end there.\n\n      Nor am I convinced otherwise by the fact that blind individuals\n\nhave previously graduated from Palmer.        These individuals attended\n\nPalmer many years ago. See Case W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1385\n\n(discounting testimony of blind doctor who graduated from Case Western\n\nbecause the doctor “attended [the university] twenty years ago, under\n\nentirely different circumstances than proposed today”).     The academic\n\nstandards of the profession have changed since those individuals\n\ngraduated, and uniform technical standards have been adopted. Under\n\nthe majority’s analysis, a school could never strengthen its program\n\nrequirements for legitimate reasons if the result excludes a disabled\n\nperson.\n\n      The commission erred, as a matter of law, by failing to defer to\n\nPalmer’s decision that Cannon could not satisfy its academic standards.\n\nSee Wynne I, 932 F.2d at 26 (explaining institution must seek means of\n\f                                     50\n\nreasonably accommodating individual and “[i]f the institution submits\n\nundisputed facts demonstrating that the relevant officials within the\n\ninstitution considered alternative means . . . the court could rule as a\n\nmatter of law that the institution had met its duty”). Palmer fulfilled its\n\nobligation of inquiry before denying Cannon’s requested accommodation\n\nof a sighted assistant to read X-rays. Palmer has reasonably concluded\n\nthat the ability to personally see and interpret X-rays is essential in order\n\nto successfully diagnose and treat patients, without relying on the\n\nobservations of an untrained sighted assistant. Considering the safety of\n\nfuture patients, there is nothing unreasonable about this requirement.\n\nThe majority has not “struck a balance” between the statutory rights\n\nensuring those with disabilities “meaningful access” to the benefits\n\noffered by educational institutions and “the legitimate interests” of those\n\ninstitutions in preserving the integrity of their programs. See Alexander\n\nv. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300–01, 105 S. Ct. 712, 720, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661,\n\n671–72 (1985).     Rather, the majority and the commission have run\n\nroughshod over Palmer’s legitimate interests and the integrity of Palmer’s\n\nchiropractic program. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n      Mansfield, J., joins this dissent.\n\f",

Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n        Palmer College of Chiropractic (Palmer) is a chiropractic school\n\nwith campuses located in Iowa, Florida, and California. At its Davenport,\n\nIowa location, Palmer administers bachelor of science and doctor of\n\nchiropractic programs.    Aaron Cannon applied to Palmer’s bachelor of\n\nscience program at its Davenport, Iowa location, in the early spring of\n\n2004.\n\n        Cannon had informed Palmer he was blind early in the application\n\nprocess.    Palmer directed him to its contact person for students with\n\ndisabilities, and Cannon met with the representative that spring. At that\n\nmeeting, Cannon explained he had sometimes taken examinations with\n\nthe assistance of a sighted reader in the past, he planned on completing\n\nthe graduate program’s undergraduate prerequisites and matriculating\n\nin the graduate program in March 2005, and he was in the process of\n\nregistering and exploring additional accommodations for his blindness\n\nwith the Iowa Department for the Blind (IDOB).              The Palmer\n\nrepresentative told Cannon she would discuss this information further\n\f                                    4\n\nwith key representatives of Palmer.       She also revealed to Cannon,\n\nhowever, that Palmer had in the summer of 2002 adopted certain\n\ntechnical standards for admission to and graduation from its degree\n\nprograms.\n\n      The technical standards adopted for each of Palmer’s three\n\ncampuses across the country require that degree candidates have\n\n“sufficient use of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation necessary to\n\nperform chiropractic and general physical examination, including the\n\nprocedures of inspection, palpation, auscultations, and the review of\n\nradiographs as taught in the curriculum.”     Based on these standards,\n\nthe Palmer representative explained, Cannon would find it difficult, if not\n\nimpossible, to enter and complete Palmer’s graduate program.\n\n      Despite the caution Palmer’s representative expressed in the spring\n\n2004 meeting, Cannon was admitted to Palmer’s undergraduate program\n\na few months later. He was also provisionally admitted to the graduate\n\nprogram, contingent on his successful completion of the required\n\nundergraduate coursework—without, apparently, any further inquiry as\n\nto if or how Cannon might satisfy Palmer’s technical standards. Cannon\n\nenrolled in July 2004 and began coursework in the undergraduate\n\nprogram.\n\n      In August, shortly after enrolling, Cannon met again with Palmer’s\n\ndisability representative to discuss possible accommodations.          The\n\nPalmer representative indicated she would arrange a meeting with\n\nPalmer’s Disability Steering Committee in the next two weeks to further\n\ndiscuss possibilities.   While waiting for that meeting to materialize,\n\nCannon sent the Palmer representative an email detailing his skills and\n\ncapabilities for dealing with certain visual challenges. He noted in the\n\nemail his familiarity with various adaptive technologies, including\n\f                                         5\n\ntechnologies for note taking and producing tactile versions of images and\n\ndiagrams, and his history of success in previous classes having\n\nsignificant visual components.           Two trimesters later, Cannon had\n\nsuccessfully completed the graduate program’s required undergraduate\n\ncoursework, achieving a cumulative grade point average of 3.44 on a 4.0-\n\npoint scale.1\n\n       As he neared completion of the undergraduate coursework, a\n\nmeeting with Palmer’s Disability Steering Committee was finally arranged\n\nin February 2005. Cannon reiterated his interest in preparing for and\n\nenrolling in the graduate program at the meeting.                    The steering\n\ncommittee again expressed doubt Cannon would be able to complete the\n\nprogram because Palmer’s technical standards required sufficient use of\n\nvision.   Cannon suggested several possible accommodations for the\n\nvisual components of the curriculum, including a sighted reader and\n\nmodifications of certain practical examinations, while acknowledging he\n\ncould not yet anticipate each challenge that might present itself in the\n\ngraduate program.       The steering committee suggested these could not\n\nconstitute acceptable accommodations for certain diagnostic portions of\n\nthe curriculum and explained Cannon would therefore reach a “stoppage\n\npoint,” after which he would no longer be able to meet Palmer’s\n\nrequirements for advancement in the program. That point, the steering\n\ncommittee advised, would occur at the beginning of the fifth semester—\n\nthe point at which students were slated to begin radiology and other\n\ndiagnostic coursework. Cannon proposed that a sighted assistant might\n\n\n\n       1The  record reveals Cannon’s grade point average may have been negatively\naffected by the fact he missed his anatomy final in the winter of 2005 to be with his\nwife, who gave birth on the same day.\n\f                                     6\n\ncommunicate to him the pertinent visual information in these courses\n\nenabling him to analyze it and to learn to make diagnoses accordingly.\n\n      The steering committee expressed doubt as to the feasibility of\n\nCannon’s proposed accommodation, suggesting it would place too much\n\nresponsibility on the assistant. The committee thus repeated its position\n\nthat the beginning of the fifth semester would constitute the stoppage\n\npoint, but Cannon proposed they cross that bridge later after further\n\ninvestigation. Given the committee’s apparent reliance on the recently\n\nadopted   technical    standards    in   concluding   Cannon’s   proposed\n\naccommodations were unacceptable, Cannon asked about the purpose of\n\nthe standards and whether they might be modifiable.        The committee\n\nexplained modification would compromise Palmer’s compliance with\n\nstandards promulgated by the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE),\n\nthe national accreditation body.     The CCE standards, the committee\n\nexplained, were “not negotiable.”\n\n      Cannon was undeterred and enrolled in the graduate program,\n\napparently without objection from Palmer, a few days later.       Cannon\n\nbelieved with further investigation, he and Palmer could find an\n\naccommodation that would allow him to continue in the program and\n\neventually graduate.    Two weeks after his meeting with the steering\n\ncommittee, Cannon sent a letter to Palmer’s president, expressing his\n\nfrustration with the trajectory the meeting had taken.      In the letter,\n\nCannon noted he was aware of numerous blind individuals who had\n\nbecome successful chiropractors in the past, including at least two who\n\nhad graduated from Palmer. In addition, Cannon explained IDOB had at\n\nits disposal “a wealth of information about strategies and techniques” for\n\ncoping with some of the challenges Palmer foresaw and suggested Palmer\n\f                                         7\n\nshould consult with IDOB before rejecting out of hand his requests and\n\nsuggestions for accommodation.\n\n      Palmer responded to Cannon’s letter a month and a half later in\n\nmid-April.   Palmer explained its adoption of technical standards was\n\nconsistent with the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nof 1990 and the earlier-existing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n(Rehabilitation Act). Those laws proscribed discrimination on the basis\n\nof disability, Palmer explained, but they did not require an institution to\n\nprovide accommodations or curricular modifications if they would\n\nfundamentally     alter   the    institution’s   educational   program.      The\n\ncurricular modifications Palmer had granted to blind students in the\n\npast, Palmer explained, would not satisfy its current technical standards,\n\nand thus any similar modification now would constitute a fundamental\n\nalteration of its new program as defined by the technical standards.\n\nNevertheless, Palmer explained, it would contact IDOB to inquire about\n\nother possible accommodations.\n\n      A   month     later,      two   Palmer     representatives   met    with   a\n\nrepresentative from IDOB.         Notes from the meeting indicate “no new\n\ninformation” was presented—Palmer explained its technical standards\n\nwere necessary for accreditation and the accommodations proposed by\n\nCannon would not satisfy these standards.              The IDOB representative\n\npointed out a blind individual had recently graduated from medical\n\nschool in Wisconsin and the school had maintained its accreditation, but\n\nthe Palmer representatives declined to explore further the investigation\n\nand accommodations the school had made. Instead, they stressed the\n\nimportance of their own technical standards and their concern about the\n\ntime, effort, and money Cannon had already expended and would\n\ncontinue to expend despite their indications he would be unable to\n\f                                           8\n\ncomplete the program.            Although the IDOB representative noted the\n\nmeeting       “concluded   with     no    real   progress    made,”       the   Palmer\n\nrepresentatives stated they remained open to further guidance from the\n\nIDOB.\n\n       Cannon received a meeting report, summarizing the Palmer–IDOB\n\nconversation,      from    the     IDOB     representative      shortly    thereafter.\n\nFrustrated,     and   without      any    indication   Palmer     intended      further\n\ninvestigation, Cannon filed a notice of withdrawal from the graduate\n\nprogram a few weeks later in early June 2005, before completing final\n\ncoursework for his first trimester in the program. His grade report for\n\nthe incomplete trimester indicated two grades of “C,” five grades of “No\n\nCredit,” and withdrawal from one class. Cannon later testified that prior\n\nto withdrawal, he had been confident he would receive strong grades for\n\nthe term given his prior record at Palmer, but because he had withdrawn\n\nbefore final examinations and therefore missed and received no credit for\n\nthem, he was left with the weak record on the report.2\n\n       Cannon filed a complaint with the Davenport Civil Rights\n\nCommission (commission) in July, contending Palmer had discriminated\n\nagainst him on the basis of his disability in violation of the Davenport\nCivil Rights Ordinance (DCRO), the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA), and\n\nfederal antidiscrimination laws. After reviewing the facts and applicable\n\nlaws, the commission found probable cause existed to demonstrate\n\ndiscrimination, and the matter came before the commission for public\n\nhearing in February 2010. The two-day hearing featured testimony and\n\nexhibits from Cannon, Cannon’s wife, three Palmer faculty members and\n\n       2The record reveals Cannon’s withdrawal near the end of the trimester came too\nlate for Cannon to receive grades of “Incomplete.” He nevertheless chose to withdraw\nand miss his final examinations, which resulted in the grades of “C” and “No Credit.”\n\f                                        9\n\nofficials, and a blind graduate of Palmer who now works as a\n\nchiropractor.\n\n       A few months after the hearing, the commission hearing officer\n\nissued a proposed order, finding Cannon had proved by a preponderance\n\nPalmer had discriminated on the basis of his blindness and granting\n\nproposed relief of damages equal to Cannon’s previous cost of\n\nattendance, emotional distress damages, and attorney fees and costs.\n\nCannon      submitted    exceptions    to    the   proposed   order,   requesting\n\nreadmission with reasonable accommodation and an order enjoining\n\nPalmer’s strict application of its technical standards to blind individuals.\n\nPalmer submitted its own exceptions, requesting that the commission\n\nreject the proposed order in its entirety, dismiss the complaint, and\n\nassess costs to Cannon.\n\n       The parties addressed their exceptions at oral argument before the\n\ncommission in August.         After deliberations at its next two closed\n\nsessions, the commission issued a final order adopting the hearing\n\nofficer’s   proposed    conclusion    that    Cannon    had   proven    disability\n\ndiscrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.             The commission\n\nsupplemented its final order with the injunctive readmission and\n\naccommodation Cannon had requested.\n\n       In support of its order, the commission set forth extensive findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law. More specifically, the commission found\n\nCannon was a person with a disability and “an otherwise qualified”\n\nstudent under the relevant federal, state, and municipal code provisions;\n\nhe had requested specific accommodations for his blindness from Palmer\n\non multiple occasions; and Palmer had denied these requests and failed\n\nto engage in the interactive investigative process required by federal and\n\nstate disability law. Further, the commission found, Cannon’s requested\n\f                                     10\n\naccommodations would not fundamentally alter Palmer’s curriculum,\n\nbecause Palmer had previously graduated blind students from its Iowa\n\ncampus, Palmer’s California campus already waived certain vision-\n\nspecific competencies in its technical standards based on California\n\nantidiscrimination   law,   Palmer    had     presented   no   evidence   its\n\naccreditation had been compromised by accommodations similar to those\n\nCannon had requested or by the California competency waivers, and\n\nPalmer had presented no evidence state licensing boards would exclude\n\nblind individuals from practice.     Based on these factual findings, the\n\ncommission concluded Cannon was otherwise qualified to participate in\n\nPalmer’s graduate program and was denied participation in the program\n\non the basis of his disability.      The commission therefore concluded\n\nPalmer’s strict application of its technical standards to Cannon violated\n\nthe DCRO, ICRA, and the ADA.\n\n      Palmer sought judicial review of the final order. The district court,\n\nexplaining it was reviewing the commission’s legal conclusions for errors\n\nof law and the commission’s factual findings for substantial evidence,\n\nreversed the commission’s order.          Without explicitly suggesting the\n\ncommission’s factual findings were unsupported by substantial evidence,\n\nthe district court determined the commission had failed, as a matter of\n\nlaw, to give appropriate deference to Palmer’s identification of its\n\ncurricular requirements, and therefore concluded substantial evidence\n\nsupported Palmer’s claims that Cannon’s suggested accommodation was\n\nunreasonable and would constitute a fundamental alteration of the\n\nPalmer curriculum.\n\n      Cannon appealed the district court decision and we retained the\n\nappeal.\n\f                                    11\n\n      II. Scope and Standards of Review.\n\n      Our general assembly has directed that final decisions of\n\nmunicipal civil rights commissions shall be reviewable to the same extent\n\nas final decisions of the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC). See Iowa\n\nCode § 216.19 (2013). We review decisions of the ICRC according to the\n\nstandards delineated in Iowa’s Administrative Procedure Act, set forth in\n\nchapter 17A of the Iowa Code.

Discussion.\n\n      Section 216.9 of ICRA provides, in general terms, that “[i]t is an\n\nunfair or discriminatory practice for any educational institution to\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of . . . disability in any program or activity.”\n\nIowa Code § 216.9. The DCRO sets forth the same general language in\n\nextending its own protections against disability discrimination, to\n\n“provide for the execution within the city of the policies embodied in the\n\nIowa Civil Rights Act of 1965 and” related federal civil rights laws. See\n\nDavenport, Iowa, Mun. Code § 2.58.010(B) (2013); id. § 2.58.125(A).\n\nFederal law extends its own disability discrimination protections in both\n\f                                      12\n\nthe ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101–12213 (2006);\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n\n      We have often explained we will look to the ADA and cases\n\ninterpreting its language, as well as cases interpreting the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, for guidance as we analyze disability discrimination claims brought\n\nunder ICRA. See, e.g., Fuller v. Iowa Dep’t of Human Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572877\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572877/fuller-v-iowa-dept-of-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329 (Iowa 1998).       We have also explained we may look to the\n\nregulations underlying the federal acts in our analysis. Id. While these\n\nauthorities are often persuasive, we note we are also guided by the\n\nbreadth of the protections very clearly set forth in both ICRA and the\n\nDCRO.    See Iowa Code § 216.18(1) (“This chapter shall be construed\n\nbroadly to effectuate its purposes.”); Davenport, Iowa, Mun. Code\n\n§ 2.58.020 (“This chapter shall be construed broadly to effectuate its\n\npurpose.”).\n\n      While ICRA and the DCRO set forth their protections in general\n\nterms, without language of limitation, the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA\n\ncontain additional content in their statutory provisions.           The ADA,\n\napplicable to all academic institutions receiving federal funding, provides\n\nthat “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability . . . be denied the benefits of the . . . programs . . . of a public\n\nentity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12132. The Rehabilitation Act sets forth a similar standard, providing\n\n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by\n\nreason of her or his disability . . . be denied the benefits of . . . any\n\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”        29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794.   Both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act specifically prohibit\n\ndiscrimination against those with disabilities based not just on\n\f                                         13\n\n“affirmative    animus,”      but    also     any    discrimination      based      on\n\nthoughtlessness, apathy, or stereotype.3 See, e.g., Alexander v. Choate,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295–97, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id. § 104.44(a).       The ADA\n\nincorporates a closely related accommodation requirement in defining a\n\n“qualified individual with a disability” as one “who, with or without\n\nreasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices . . . or the\n\nprovision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility\n\nrequirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs\n\nor activities provided.”      42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).

See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 816. The parties concede here Palmer\nreceives federal financial assistance for purposes of Cannon’s federal claims and the\nfederal assistance requirement is inapplicable to Cannon’s state and municipal claims.\n\f                                           15\n\nof his disability, we consider here only the question of whether Cannon\n\nwas qualified to participate in the Palmer program with reasonable\n\naccommodation.5\n       1. The meaning of “Qualified with Reasonable Accommodation.” As\n\nnoted, the relevant federal acts and regulations define qualified\n\nindividuals as those individuals who, with reasonable accommodation or\n\n“modification,” can meet the “essential eligibility requirements”6 of the\n\ninstitution.     42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).7           In interpreting the meaning of\n\nreasonable accommodation, the United States Supreme Court has noted\n\nregulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act provide reasonable\n\n“[m]odifications may include changes in the length of time permitted for\n\nthe completion of degree requirements, substitution of specific courses\n\nrequired for the completion of degree requirements, and adaptation of the\n\n       5Palmer   notes other courts have sometimes expressed the “was denied the\nbenefits of the program” element of the analysis as a requirement that a claimant has\nbeen “dismissed” from the program. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 816. Because Cannon\nwithdrew from the graduate program on his own, Palmer suggests he may not have met\na “dismissal” requirement. We note, however, the relevant statutes here require only\nthat a claimant be “denied the benefits” of the program for purposes of making out a\nclaim. 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794; Iowa Code § 216.9(1)(a); Davenport, Iowa,\nMun. Code § 2.58.125(A)(1). Palmer concedes Cannon would have been denied the\nbenefits of the program by the fifth trimester, if not earlier, based on his blindness, and\nthus we need not address the element further here.\n       6As noted, relevant Rehabilitation Act regulations set forth slightly different\nlanguage in explaining a qualified individual may be required to “meet[] the academic\nand technical standards requisite to admission or participation in the recipient’s\neducation program or activity.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(l)(3).\n        7We note the Rehabilitation Act adds the term “otherwise” in prohibiting\n\ndiscrimination against an “otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794(a).

We find\nthe suggestion unpersuasive—we cannot conclude the implementing regulation in\nquestion simply absolves institutions of their obligation of accommodation in cases\nwhere requests are made by individuals, as opposed to groups of students. Instead, we\nbelieve the regulation indicates the “personal nature” principle is directed to services\nand devices dedicated exclusively to individuals—services that cannot, by their nature,\ntypically also be used as accommodation by other individuals.            See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 104.44(d)(2). Palmer has not suggested Cannon’s requests fit that latter description.\n\f                                    17\n\nat 2368 n.9, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990 n.9 (quoting 45 C.F.R. § 84.44). In\n\naddition, an accommodation may not be reasonable, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explained, if it imposes “undue financial [or] administrative burdens”\n\non the institution, or if it requires “a fundamental alteration in the\n\nnature of [the] program” offered. Id. at 410–12, 99 S. Ct. at 2369–70, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990–92. Because the parties have not raised below or on\n\nappeal   an   issue   of   undue    burden    with   respect   to   possible\n\naccommodations, and because Cannon’s requests fit plausibly within the\n\nrange of accommodations recognized as reasonable by courts and the\n\nADA’s implementing regulation, we consider here only the issue of\n\nwhether accommodation would constitute a fundamental alteration of\n\nPalmer’s program.\n\n      2. The general contours of the fundamental alteration analysis. In\n\nDavis, the Supreme Court encountered a case of a student with\n\nsubstantial hearing loss who sought nursing training at Southeastern\n\nCommunity College, in pursuit of her eventual goal of state nursing\n\ncertification in North Carolina.     Id. at 400, 99 S. Ct. at 2364, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 985–86. Upon learning of the student’s hearing loss in the\n\napplication process, Southeastern consulted its entire nursing faculty,\n\nan outside audiologist, and the director of the North Carolina nursing\n\nboard, as part of its process of determining whether the student could be\n\nadmitted to the Southeastern program and whether the student could\n\nlater safely participate in Southeastern’s clinical training program. Id. at\n\n401–02, 99 S. Ct. at 2364–65, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 985–86. Based largely on\n\nthe views of the nursing board director that the student had “hearing\n\nlimitations which could interfere with her safely caring for patients,” and\n\nlimitations that could make it “impossible for [the student] to participate\n\nsafely in the normal clinical training program,” Southeastern denied the\n\f                                        18\n\nstudent admission.       Id. at 401–02, 99 S. Ct. at 2365, 60 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n985–86.\n\n       Relying on those conclusions, the Supreme Court explained\n\n“Southeastern, with prudence, could [therefore] allow [the student] to\n\ntake only academic classes.”          Id. at 409–10, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990.     Whatever benefits the student might have received\n\nfrom an academic course of study, the Court explained, “she would not\n\nreceive even a rough equivalent of the training a nursing program\n\nnormally gives.” Id. at 410, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990. That\n\nkind   of    modification,   the   Court     concluded,   would    constitute   a\n\n“fundamental alteration” of Southeastern’s nursing program far greater\n\nthan the reasonable “modification” required by federal laws and\n\nregulations. Id.\n\n       In reaching its conclusion on the fundamental alteration question\n\nthirty-five years ago, however, the Supreme Court explained the line\n\nbetween reasonable accommodation and fundamental alteration would\n\nnot always be so neatly drawn in the future.           Id. at 412, 99 S. Ct. at\n\n2370, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 992.         “It is possible to envision situations,” the\n\nCourt observed, “where an insistence on continuing past requirements\n\nand practices” may deprive “genuinely qualified” persons of opportunities\n\nfor participation in educational programs. Id. Technological advances,\n\nthe Court explained, should be expected to enhance and appropriately\n\nadapt opportunities for individuals with disabilities without undue\n\nburden, and refusals to modify programs accordingly may then\n\nconstitute discrimination under the relevant laws.          Id. at 412–13, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 2370, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 992.         Identification of instances where\n\nrefusal     to   accommodate       constitutes   discrimination,    the    Court\n\nemphasized,      would   therefore    remain     an   important    and    ongoing\n\f                                      19\n\nresponsibility of those tasked with implementation and application of our\n\ndisability discrimination laws. Id.\n\n       Courts later applying the teachings of Davis have explained it\n\n“struck a balance” between the statutory rights ensuring those with\n\ndisabilities “meaningful access” to the benefits offered by educational\n\ninstitutions, and “the legitimate interests” of those institutions “in\n\npreserving the integrity of their programs.” Alexander, 469 U.S. at 300,\n\n105 S. Ct. at 720, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 671; Case W. Reserve Univ., 666\n\nN.E.2d   at   1384   (quoting   Alexander).   To   strike   that   balance\n\nappropriately, the Supreme Court has observed, courts and educational\n\ninstitutions alike must take great care not to define the benefit or\n\nprogram “in a way that effectively denies otherwise qualified . . .\n\nindividuals [with disabilities] the meaningful access to which they are\n\nentitled.” Alexander, 469 U.S. at 301, 105 S. Ct. at 720, 83 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n672.\n\n       Recognizing this fine line, lower courts have elucidated two\n\nprinciples in the fundamental alteration analysis that guide us in our\n\ninquiry here.   First, courts have recognized that in considering the\n\ninterests of educational institutions in the integrity of their programs,\n\nsome deference to the institution’s professional or academic judgment\n\nmay often be appropriate. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 817; Wynne v.\n\nTufts Univ.

Second,\n\nhowever, whether and the extent to which that deference is appropriate\n\ndepends heavily on the institution’s satisfaction of several obligations.\n\nSee Wong, 192 F.3d at 817–18; Wynne, 932 F.2d at 25–26.               The\n\ninstitution, for example, has a “real obligation” to seek out “suitable\n\nmeans of reasonably accommodating” individuals with disabilities and to\n\nsubmit “a factual record indicating” it “conscientiously carried out this\n\f                                     20\n\nstatutory obligation.”   Wynne, 932 F.2d at 25–26; see also Wong, 192\n\nF.3d at 818 (“Subsumed within this standard is the institution’s duty to\n\nmake itself aware of the nature of the student’s disability [and] to explore\n\nalternatives for accommodating the student[.]”). That obligation requires\n\nan individualized and extensive inquiry—an institution must “carefully\n\nconsider[] each disabled student’s particular limitations and analyz[e]\n\nwhether and how it might accommodate that student in a way that\n\nwould allow the student to complete the school’s program without\n\nlowering academic standards.” Wong, 192 F.3d at 826; see Mark H. v.\n\nHamamoto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174111\"><a href=\"/opinion/174111/mark-h-v-hamamoto/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 (9th Cir. 2010) (“ ‘[M]ere speculation\n\nthat a suggested accommodation is not feasible falls short of the\n\nreasonable accommodation requirement; [the Rehabilitation Act] create[s]\n\na duty to gather sufficient information from the disabled individual and\n\nqualified experts as needed to determine what accommodations are\n\nnecessary.’ ” (quoting Duvall v.

On appeal, Palmer\n\ncontends the commission erred, as a matter of law, in failing to grant\n\nappropriate deference to Palmer’s position regarding Cannon’s ability to\n\ncomplete the graduate program without fundamental alteration, and\n\nrelies on two distinct grounds.\n\n      First, Palmer relies on an earlier Iowa higher education case where\n\nwe explained we “ ‘may not override’ ” an institution’s professional\n\njudgment “ ‘unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted\n\nacademic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee\n\nresponsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.’ ” See North\n\nv.

In North, however, we were\n\nnot faced with claims of disability discrimination under the ADA or\n\nICRA—instead, we considered breach of contract, tortious interference,\n\nand substantive due process and § 1983 civil rights claims. See id. at\n\n568–71.    We imported that principle of academic deference from a\n\nSupreme Court case that had also considered a due process claim, where\n\nthe Court had no occasion to consider the level of deference to be\n\naccorded in discrimination cases and had taken pains to note it was not\n\nconsidering claims beyond those before it.

Palmer\n\nadvances a two-pronged exposition of its investigation with respect to\n\nCannon.      First, Palmer recounts the numerous discussions its faculty\n\nhad in developing the technical standards it seeks to apply here, points\n\nto the evidence it presented below supporting its initial creation and\n\nadoption of the standards, and notes the “standards are based upon\n\n[Palmer’s] teaching experiences with disabled students including those\n\nvisually impaired.” Second, Palmer explains the “technical standards are\n\f                                    25\n\napplied on a case-by-case basis depending upon whether or not the\n\ndisabled individual meets those standards.” Based on this exposition, we\n\ncannot conclude the commission’s findings regarding Palmer’s approach\n\nwere unsupported by substantial evidence or that the commission erred\n\nin determining Palmer failed to advance evidence of an inquiry\n\nresembling anything like the fact-specific, individualized inquiry required\n\nby the caselaw.\n\n      On the first point, Palmer appears to concede it seeks to invoke its\n\nstandards in Cannon’s case as an “essential requirement” based on no\n\ninvestigation at all of Cannon’s condition or ability to perform with a\n\nreader or the various technologies he noted he had or could have at his\n\ndisposal.   Instead, Palmer would invoke the standards based on its\n\nexperiences with past individuals with disabilities.          That strict,\n\ngeneralized invocation of Palmer’s technical standard falls far short, we\n\nthink, of the conscientious, interactive, student-specific inquiry required\n\nby the caselaw. See, e.g., Wong, 192 F.3d at 819 (“Dean Lewis failed to\n\ndiscuss Wong’s proposal with any of the professionals who had worked\n\nwith Wong to pinpoint his disability and help him develop skills to cope\n\nwith it.”); Laura Rothstein, Disability Law and Higher Education: A Road\n\nMap for Where We’ve Been and Where We May Be Heading, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nRev. 122, 142 (2004) (“In determining that it would not be a substantial\n\nalteration to accommodate Casey Martin by allowing the use of a golf cart\n\nin professional golf tournament play, the [Supreme Court] emphasized\n\nthe importance of an individualized assessment.

Second, in reviewing the\n\ncommission’s application of the law to the facts, we may look to other\n\ngrounds of error, such as erroneous interpretation of law, irrational\n\nreasoning, or failure to consider relevant facts, in determining whether\n\nthe commission has abused its discretion in its application. Id. at 218–\n\n19.\n\n      As noted above, the commission made several noteworthy findings\n\nin support of its determination Cannon’s proposed accommodation was\n\nreasonable. First, the commission found the record revealed no evidence\n\nstate licensing boards required sight, or interpretation of radiographic\n\nimages in precisely the manner required by Palmer, for purposes of\n\nlicensure.       Second,    Palmer     presented    no   evidence    the   course\n\nmodifications and waivers it grants at its California campus have\n\njeopardized its accreditation with national accrediting bodies. Third, at\n\nleast two blind students had graduated previously from Palmer’s\n\nDavenport       campus     and   are    currently   licensed   and     practicing\n\nsuccessfully.\n\n      Palmer asserts, however, that it cannot accommodate Cannon, and\n\nthe commission’s decision must therefore be reversed as a matter of law,\n\nbecause all chiropractic students must be able to see radiographic\n\nimages. We find this contention unpersuasive. Palmer itself concedes at\n\nleast twenty percent of current chiropractic practitioners practice without\n\n“the ability to take plain film radiographs in their office[],” and concedes\n\nthe size of the fraction is currently on the rise. These concessions are at\n\nodds with the contention radiographic image interpretation—regardless\n\f                                     35\n\nwhether in the narrow sense Palmer has defined it or even the more\n\ngeneral sense of having the equipment available—must constitute an\n\n“essential” component of the education or practice of chiropractic.\n\nFurthermore, as Palmer has noted, frequent consultation between\n\nchiropractors and radiology specialists is “oftentimes” “part of the clinical\n\npractice [of chiropractic].”\n\n        We also find it instructive that numerous medical schools,\n\nostensibly recognizing these realities, have admitted blind students and\n\nmade accommodation in recent years. See, e.g., Sarah M. Eickmeyer et\n\nal., North American Medical Schools’ Experience with and Approaches to\n\nthe Needs of Students with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, 87 Acad.\n\nMed. 567, 569–70 (2012) (finding at least sixty partially- or totally-blind\n\nstudents matriculated at U.S. medical schools between 2001 and 2010\n\nand noting schools have provided accommodations ranging from “[an]\n\nassistant for observation” to “[an] assistant for physical exam[ination]”).\n\nThe accommodations made by these schools, coupled with Palmer’s own\n\nprevious accommodations, weigh particularly heavily against Palmer’s\n\nfundamental alteration defense. See Am. Council of the Blind, 525 F.3d\n\nat 1272; Tamara, 964 F. Supp. 2d at 1084–85.               Recent proposed\n\nrulemaking by the Department of Justice bolsters this position, as it\n\nseeks    “to   ensure   that   medical    diagnostic   equipment,   including\n\nexamination tables, examination chairs, . . . and other imaging\n\nequipment used by health care providers for diagnostic purposes are\n\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.”          Medical\n\nDiagnostic Equipment Accessibility Standards, 77 Fed.

Conclusion.\n\n       We conclude substantial evidence supports the commission’s\n\nfactual findings and the commission has not erred in interpreting the\n\nrelevant laws or applying them to the facts at issue here. We therefore\n\nreverse the decision of the district court and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to affirm the commission’s order.\n\n       REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n\n       All justices concur except Waterman and Mansfield, JJ., who\n\ndissent.\n\f                                        38\n                                      #12–0924, Palmer Coll. v. Davenport CRC\n\nWATERMAN, Justice (dissenting).\n\n        I respectfully dissent.    The majority elevates political correctness\n\nover common sense.          Obscured in its lengthy decision is the fact our\n\ncourt and the Davenport Civil Rights Commission are requiring Palmer\n\nCollege of Chiropractic to permit a student, blind since birth, to interpret\n\nX-rays based on what an untrained reader tells him the X-ray films\n\ndepict and treat patients through vigorous spinal adjustments relying on\n\nthat    interpretation.       Aaron    Cannon   failed   to   prove   such   an\n\naccommodation is reasonable. As the district court recognized, “vision is\n\nindispensable for several critical functions that chiropractic students and\n\nprofessionals must perform, such as reviewing X-rays, analyzing\n\nradiographs, and assessing physical symptoms.” I defer to no one in my\n\nadmiration for Cannon and his blind attorney and the challenges they\n\nboth have overcome, but there is a point at which an accommodation\n\nceases to be reasonable, and it has been met here.\n\n        What is next?        Are we going to require the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration to hire blind air traffic controllers, relying on assistants to\n\ntell them what is appearing on the screen? The principle is the same\n\nhere.    A misinterpreted X-ray could lead to improper treatment and\n\nlifelong paralysis.       X-ray interpretation requires training and skilled\n\njudgment to reach correct conclusions based on shades and shadows of\n\ncomplex bony structures.          That is why many physicians with twenty–\n\ntwenty vision choose to outsource interpretation of X-rays to radiologists.\n\nIt is ludicrous to override Palmer’s academic decision and require it to\n\npermit a blind person to interpret X-rays for patient treatment based on\n\nwhat someone else claims he or she is seeing.\n\f                                   39\n\n      The majority’s intrusion into academic judgment on professional\n\nhealth care standards is unprecedented. No other court in the country\n\nhas forced an academic institution to allow a blind student to interpret\n\nX-rays relying on an untrained sighted assistant. The majority fails to\n\nconfront the well-reasoned decision of the Ohio Supreme Court applying\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–797b, to\n\nuphold a medical school’s decision to deny admission to a blind student\n\nwho, like Cannon, requested a personal assistant to read X-rays and\n\nhelp with clinical examinations.

Case W.\n\nReserve Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1376</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1383, 1386 (Ohio 1996). The district\n\ncourt correctly followed Case Western Reserve University in concluding\n\nsuch an accommodation was unreasonable and would fundamentally\n\nalter Palmer’s program.    I would affirm.   Our court and the local\n\ncommission comprised of laypersons have no business second-guessing\n\nthe professional academic judgment of our nation’s leading college of\n\nchiropractic.   Palmer has reasonably concluded that its graduates\n\npersonally must be able to see and interpret X-rays. A student who has\n\nnever seen a spine cannot reliably interpret spinal X-rays based on what\n\nsomeone else tells him the films show.\n\n      I would follow the Ohio Supreme Court’s reasoning in Case\n\nWestern, the facts of which are strikingly similar to this case. A blind\n\nstudent, Cheryl Fischer, applied to medical school at Case Western\n\nReserve University. Id. at 1379. To evaluate applicants, Case Western\n\napplied technical standards promulgated by the Association of American\n\nMedical Colleges (AAMC), which required that candidates must be able to\n\n“observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand.”   Id. at\n\n1379–80.    The AAMC technical standards explained, “The use of a\n\ntrained intermediary means that a candidate’s judgment must be\n\f                                    40\n\nmediated by someone else’s power of selection and observation.” Id. at\n\n1380. Case Western “concluded that a blind student would be unable to\n\ncomplete the requirements of the medical school program.”          Id.   An\n\nassociate professor of surgery at Case Western emphasized that “Fischer\n\nwould be unable to exercise independent judgment when reading an\n\nX-ray, unable to start an I.V., and unable to effectively participate in the\n\nsurgery clerkship.” Id. (noting further that Fischer would be unable to\n\n“identify tissue and organ structures through a microscope” or “observe\n\nhow such structures are affected by disease”).           “In the[] medical\n\neducators’ opinions, the use of an intermediary would interfere with the\n\nstudent’s exercise of independent judgment—a crucial part of developing\n\ndiagnostic skills.” Id. at 1387.\n\n      The Ohio Supreme Court deferred to Case Western’s academic\n\njudgment, as we should defer to Palmer’s.       The Ohio Supreme Court\n\nemphasized that an educational institution is in the best position to\n\ndetermine whether a student will be able to successfully complete the\n\nprogram:\n\n      [Case Western]’s decision not to modify its program by\n      waiving course requirements or permitting intermediaries to\n      read X-rays or perform physical examinations is an academic\n      decision. Courts are particularly ill-equipped to evaluate\n      academic requirements of educational institutions. As a\n      result, considerable judicial deference must be paid to\n      academic decisions made by the institution itself unless it is\n      shown that the standards serve no purpose other than to\n      deny an education to the handicapped.\n\nId. at 1386 (citations omitted).      Deferring to the AAMC technical\n\nstandards and the medical educators’ opinions, the court acknowledged\n\nthat waiving the requirement to read an X-ray—or using an intermediary\n\nto perform that function—would fundamentally alter the nature of Case\n\nWestern’s program. Id. at 1387; see also Cunningham v. Univ. of N.M. Bd.\n\f                                   41\n\nof Regents, 531 F.

Case W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1386–87.\n\n      Our case is also analogous to Davis. In Davis, the United States\n\nSupreme Court upheld a nursing college’s decision to deny admission to\n\nan applicant with a hearing disability, holding the law “does not\n\nencompass the kind of curricular changes that would be necessary to\n\naccommodate [the applicant] in the nursing program.” Davis, 442 U.S.\n\nat 409, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990. Similarly to the nursing\n\napplicant, Cannon “would not receive even a rough equivalent of the\n\ntraining” Palmer normally gives.        Id. at 410, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 990.   “Such a fundamental alteration in the nature of a\n\nprogram is far more than the ‘modification’ the regulation requires.” Id.\n\nLike the proposed accommodations for the deaf applicant in Davis, it\n\nappears unlikely “Cannon could benefit from any affirmative action that\n\nthe regulation reasonably could be interpreted as requiring.” Id. at 409,\n\n99 S. Ct. at 2368, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990.          Therefore, Palmer, “with\n\nprudence,” could not allow Cannon to graduate from the program. Id. at\n\n409, 99 S. Ct. at 2369, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 990.\n\f                                       42\n\n      As the majority notes, many practicing chiropractors lack X-ray\n\nequipment and rely on other professional radiologists or chiropractors to\n\ninterpret their patients’ X-rays.   Cannon, however, is not asking for a\n\nwaiver to allow him to rely on the interpretation of a qualified expert.\n\nRather, his requested accommodation is to interpret X-rays himself,\n\nbased on what an untrained sighted assistant tells him. In any event,\n\nthe law does not obligate Palmer to waive program requirements. The\n\nplaintiff in Case Western argued the school should waive certain medical-\n\nschool skill requirements because she planned to pursue a practice in\n\npsychiatry, in which those skills were unnecessary. 666 N.E.2d at 1386.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating:\n\n             The goal of medical schools is not to produce\n      specialized degrees but rather general degrees in medicine\n      which signify that the holder is a physician prepared for\n      further training in any area of medicine. As such, graduates\n      must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad\n      variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum\n      of patient care. All students, regardless of whether they\n      intend to practice in psychiatry or radiology, are required to\n      complete a variety of course requirements, including\n      rotations in pediatrics, gynecology, and surgery.\n\nId. at 1387.    In the same way, it is Palmer’s prerogative to decide the\nskills necessary to graduate with a chiropractic degree.      A student’s\n\nchoice to focus his or her practice on certain skills to the exclusion of\n\nothers does not exempt that student from successfully completing degree\n\nrequirements.\n\n      The majority recognizes that it is appropriate to give deference to\n\nan institution’s professional or academic judgment, yet refuses to defer to\n\nPalmer because the commission concluded Palmer did not seek out\n\n“suitable   means    of   reasonably    accommodating”   individuals   with\n\ndisabilities. I disagree that Palmer’s investigation fell short. Palmer met\n\nwith Cannon multiple times, met Iowa Department of the Blind\n\f                                       43\n\nrepresentatives, and expressed a willingness to continue the dialogue.\n\nNothing in the record supports a conclusion that further investigation by\n\nPalmer would have found a way for Cannon to personally see and\n\ninterpret X-rays. Technological advancements may one day allow blind\n\nindividuals to interpret X-rays.      No such “app” exists today.         Cannon\n\nsimply   has   not   satisfied   his     burden     to   prove    a     reasonable\n\naccommodation is possible regarding X-ray interpretation. See Boelman\n\nv.

The Court of Appeals for the\n\nNinth Circuit recognized in Wong that:\n\n            Faculty members and administrators of a professional\n      school are unquestionably in the best position to set\n      standards for the institution and to establish curricular\n      requirements that fulfill the school’s purpose of training\n      students for the work that lies ahead of them.\n\n192 F.3d at 825–26.         The court noted deference to an academic\n\ninstitution is inappropriate only if the institution has not “carefully\n\nconsider[ed] each disabled student’s particular limitations and analyz[ed]\n\nwhether and how it might accommodate that student in a way that\n\nwould allow the student to complete the school's program without\n\nlowering academic standards.” Id. at 826. The court declined to defer to\n\nthe University of California’s decision to dismiss a student because “the\n\nrecord contain[ed] facts from which a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat the school made th[at] decision[] for arbitrary reasons unrelated to\n\nits academic standards.”     Id.   In contrast, the record shows Palmer\n\ncarefully considered whether it could accommodate Cannon’s disability\n\nwith a sighted assistant to look at X-rays.       Palmer ultimately and\n\f                                    45\n\nreasonably concluded it could not.       No reasonable fact finder could\n\nconclude Palmer’s decision was unrelated to academic standards.\n\n      In Wynne I, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit set forth the\n\nappropriate analysis “to assess whether an academic institution\n\nadequately has explored the availability of reasonable accommodations\n\nfor a handicapped individual.” 932 F.2d at 26.\n\n      If the institution submits undisputed facts demonstrating\n      that the relevant officials within the institution considered\n      alternative means, their feasibility, cost and effect on the\n      academic program, and came to a rationally justifiable\n      conclusion that the available alternatives would result either\n      in lowering academic standards or requiring substantial\n      program alteration, the court could rule as a matter of law\n      that the institution had met its duty of seeking reasonable\n      accommodation.\n\nId. (noting “[i]n most cases, we believe that, as in the qualified immunity\n\ncontext, the issue of whether the facts alleged by a university support its\n\nclaim that it has met its duty of reasonable accommodation will be a\n\n“ ‘purely legal one’ ” (quoting Mitchell v.

The\n\nstudent in Wynne I asked Tufts University School of Medicine to\n\naccommodate his disability by using a different testing method than\n\nmultiple choice to evaluate his progress. Id. at 22. The court concluded\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to grant summary judgment in favor of\n\nTufts because the record did not demonstrate the school considered\n\npossible alternatives or discussed the unique qualities of multiple choice\n\nexaminations.    Id. at 28.   The court therefore remanded the case for\n\nfurther fact-finding.

Wynne II, 976 F.2d at 793. The student again appealed to the\n\nFirst Circuit.   See id.   The Wynne II court acknowledged that “Tufts’\n\nexplanations, though plausible, are not necessarily ironclad.” Id. at 795.\n\nBut, the court emphasized “the point is not whether a medical school is\n\n‘right’ or ‘wrong’ in making program-related decisions.” Id. Rather, “[t]he\n\npoint is that Tufts, after undertaking a diligent assessment of the\n\navailable options,” decided “no further accommodation could be made\n\nwithout imposing an undue (and injurious) hardship on the academic\n\nprogram.” Id. The First Circuit therefore affirmed summary judgment\n\nfor Tufts, stating “the undisputed facts contained in the expanded\n\nrecord,   when    considered   in   the   deferential   light   that    academic\n\ndecisionmaking deserves, meet the required standard.”                  Id. at 796\n\n(emphasis added) (citation omitted).        Likewise, Palmer has provided\n\ncompelling explanations why accommodating Cannon’s disability with a\n\nsighted assistant to look at X-rays for him would fundamentally alter the\n\nchiropractic program. We owe deference to Palmer’s explanations.\n\n      In order to accommodate Cannon, Palmer would have had to lower\n\nits academic standards—something the law does not require. See Wong,\n\n192 F.3d at 826 (noting an institution is responsible for “carefully\n\nconsidering each disabled student’s particular limitations and analyzing\n\nwhether and how it might accommodate that student in a way that\n\nwould allow the student to complete the school’s program without\n\nlowering academic standards” (emphasis added)); Wynne II, 976 F.2d at\n\n795 (deferring to Tufts’ conclusion that accommodating the student\n\n“would require substantial program alterations, result in lowering\n\f                                     47\n\nacademic standards, and devalue Tufts’ end product—highly trained\n\nphysicians carrying the prized credential of a Tufts degree”).         As a\n\nprofessor explained, the Palmer radiology curriculum has three primary\n\ngoals: to teach students to (1) produce diagnostic-quality X-rays, (2)\n\ninterpret and glean clinical information off of X-ray film, and (3) apply the\n\ninformation in a clinical sense for case management. The district court\n\nsummarized      how   Cannon’s    proposed     accommodation—a       sighted\n\nassistant to describe X-rays to him—would work: “Cannon asks a series\n\nof questions to the assistant, gradually posing those questions more and\n\nmore specifically as needed in order to obtain the information necessary\n\nfor him to visualize the displayed image or text.” A professor explained\n\nwhy   this   accommodation      would     compromise   Palmer’s    academic\n\nrequirements:\n\n      I haven’t been able to determine how a sighted assistant\n      could give information to the blind student that would not\n      compromise [the student’s] independent judgment of those\n      films. [For the student to ask] the question, is the film too\n      dark or is the film too light, immediately [the reader’s]\n      answer to that is a judgment and it compromises the\n      student’s ability to independently make that judgment\n      themselves.\n             ....\n             And so if a student is told . . . the film is too dark,\n      somebody has already made the judgment for them . . . . If\n      they are told the patient is not aligned or they ask the\n      question is the patient aligned and the answer is no, then\n      that, once again, leverages their independent judgment as to\n      whether or not the film needs to be repeated and/or what\n      needs to be done to make the film better.\n\nEssentially, a sighted assistant would have to interpret the X-rays and\n\nthen relay that interpretation to Cannon; Cannon would not be\n\ninterpreting the X-rays himself.        In light of these realities, Palmer\n\ndetermined that Cannon would be unable to attain the goals of the\n\f                                     48\n\nradiology curriculum. Palmer has demonstrated that a sighted assistant\n\nis not a reasonable accommodation.\n\n      It is not as if Palmer adopted the technical standards lightly or did\n\nnot consider Cannon’s arguments for why he should be admitted.\n\nPalmer has carefully considered the skills necessary to become a\n\nchiropractor and determined that the ability to read X-rays is integral.\n\nAs one Palmer professor explained, the technical standards Palmer\n\nadopted   are   “clearly   based   from   an    educational   perspective   on\n\nindividuals that we have interacted with in the curriculum and what has\n\nworked and what has not worked.”               Palmer adopted its technical\n\nstandards in order to comply with the Council on Chiropractic\n\nEducation’s national accreditation standards, further supporting the\n\nschool’s conclusion that vision is necessary to earn a chiropractic degree.\n\nSee Case W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1379–80, 1385–86 (deferring to\n\nCase Western’s application of technical standards promulgated by the\n\nAAMC).    As noted, Palmer met with Cannon multiple times, met with\n\nIowa Department of the Blind representatives, and expressed a\n\nwillingness to continue the dialogue. Cf. Wong, 192 F.3d at 819, 821\n\n(reversing summary judgment in favor of university when “Dean Lewis\n\nfailed to discuss Wong’s proposal with any of the professionals who had\n\nworked with Wong to pinpoint his disability and help him develop skills\n\nto cope with it.”).   Yet, Palmer remained convinced that the program\n\nmodifications necessary to accommodate Cannon would fundamentally\n\nalter its program.\n\n      I do not find it legally significant that Palmer modifies its course\n\nrequirements and grants certain waivers for blind students enrolled at its\n\nCalifornia campus. California law mandates these accommodations by\n\nstatute. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 1000–8 (West, Westlaw through ch.\n\f                                    49\n\n25 of 2014 Reg. Sess., Res. ch. 1 of 2013–2014 Ex. Sess., and all\n\npropositions on the 6/3/2014 ballot) (stating “[n]o blind person shall be”\n\ndenied (1) admission to a chiropractic school, (2) the right to take a\n\nchiropractic exam, (3) a chiropractic diploma, (4) admission into an\n\nexamination for a state chiropractic license, or (5) a chiropractic license\n\n“on the ground that he is blind”). That California statute does not apply\n\nextraterritorially in Iowa. Unlike California, the Iowa legislature has not\n\nenacted a statute requiring Palmer to waive requirements for blind\n\npersons. Simply because another state imposes such accommodations\n\non an institution does not mean that those accommodations are not\n\nfundamental alterations of Palmer’s Iowa academic program. Palmer has\n\nprovided   ample    evidence    supporting    why    Cannon’s    proposed\n\naccommodation would fundamentally alter its program, and our inquiry\n\nshould end there.\n\n      Nor am I convinced otherwise by the fact that blind individuals\n\nhave previously graduated from Palmer.        These individuals attended\n\nPalmer many years ago. See Case W. Reserve Univ., 666 N.E.2d at 1385\n\n(discounting testimony of blind doctor who graduated from Case Western\n\nbecause the doctor “attended [the university] twenty years ago, under\n\nentirely different circumstances than proposed today”).     The academic\n\nstandards of the profession have changed since those individuals\n\ngraduated, and uniform technical standards have been adopted. Under\n\nthe majority’s analysis, a school could never strengthen its program\n\nrequirements for legitimate reasons if the result excludes a disabled\n\nperson.\n\n      The commission erred, as a matter of law, by failing to defer to\n\nPalmer’s decision that Cannon could not satisfy its academic standards.\n\nSee Wynne I, 932 F.2d at 26 (explaining institution must seek means of\n\f                                     50\n\nreasonably accommodating individual and “[i]f the institution submits\n\nundisputed facts demonstrating that the relevant officials within the\n\ninstitution considered alternative means . . . the court could rule as a\n\nmatter of law that the institution had met its duty”). Palmer fulfilled its\n\nobligation of inquiry before denying Cannon’s requested accommodation\n\nof a sighted assistant to read X-rays. Palmer has reasonably concluded\n\nthat the ability to personally see and interpret X-rays is essential in order\n\nto successfully diagnose and treat patients, without relying on the\n\nobservations of an untrained sighted assistant. Considering the safety of\n\nfuture patients, there is nothing unreasonable about this requirement.\n\nThe majority has not “struck a balance” between the statutory rights\n\nensuring those with disabilities “meaningful access” to the benefits\n\noffered by educational institutions and “the legitimate interests” of those\n\ninstitutions in preserving the integrity of their programs.
