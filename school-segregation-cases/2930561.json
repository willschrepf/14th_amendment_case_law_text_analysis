A short time later,\nthe trial court determined child support obligations, awarded spousal maintenance,\ndivided the couple’s assets and liabilities, and entered a final judgment. In five\nissues on appeal, Appellant, Cliressa Brown, challenges the judgment of the trial\n\fcourt on (1) the denial of her objection to the trial judge, (2) the award of child\nsupport, (3) the award of spousal maintenance, (4) the division of property, and (5)\nRonald’s use of community funds to pay his attorney’s fees. We affirm.\n                                       I. Evidence at Trial\n      Cliressa and Ronald married on June 17, 1998. On September 29, 2011,\nRonald filed an original petition for divorce. In response, Cliressa answered and\nfiled a counter-petition for divorce. On May 15, 2012, the Honorable Donald R.\nJones held a bench trial on their respective petitions.\n      Ronald testified that he and Cliressa had one adult child and three minor\nchildren.1 Shortly after the couple’s first child was born in 1992, Ronald asked\nCliressa to marry him, but she refused. Ronald then moved to Tennessee and\nbegan working as a mechanical planner and field engineer. Cliressa and Ronald\nlater reconciled, and Ronald briefly moved back to Texas in 1995.                                Because\nRonald made substantially less money working in Texas, he and Cliressa decided\nthat he would go back to work “on the road.”\n      Cliressa and Ronald eventually married in 1998 but continued to live apart.\nOver the course of the next decade, Cliressa cared for the couple’s children in\nTexas while Ronald worked in Tennessee, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ontario, Florida,\nand Arizona. During the time that he was away, Ronald sent Cliressa $4,000 every\ntwo weeks until 2009, and from then on, $3,700 every two weeks.\n      Ronald began working in Florida again in 2011 and was working there at the\ntime of the trial. Ronald explained that he worked twelve hours a day, six to seven\ndays a week. Ronald’s income tax return showed that he made a gross income of\n$178,901.75 in 2011, and Ronald stated that he was making a comparable income\nat the time of the trial. Ronald noted that he and Cliressa had substantial marital\ndebts, including the mortgage on their house in Texas and unpaid balances on two\n\n      1\n       Cliressa does not challenge the trial court’s order as to custody and visitation of the children.\n                                                    2\n\fvehicles and several credit cards. Ronald asked the court to order the sale of the\ncouple’s property in Texas in order to help pay the marital debts.\n          Ronald claimed that Cliressa refused to move with their children to any of\nhis locations. Ronald also claimed that neither Cliressa nor his children ever\nvisited him while he was working away from them. On cross-examination, Ronald\nrecalled that Cliressa once came to see him in Ontario and brought the couple’s\ntwo oldest children.\nRonald stated that he had felt alienated from his wife since 2004 and that she only\ncalled him when she needed money. Ronald noted that he and Cliressa had not had\nsexual relations since shortly after the birth of their last child and that Cliressa had\nrefused his attempts to initiate sexual relations after that point. 2\n          Ronald admitted that he had been having sexual relations with another\nwoman since 2006 or 2007.3 Ronald stated that he did not tell Cliressa about the\naffair.\n          Cliressa testified that, although she received over $90,000 each year from\nRonald, she struggled financially. Cliressa stated that she does not travel or spend\nmoney on herself and that she cuts her own hair and her children’s hair to save\nmoney. Cliressa explained that she began working as a waitress in a soda shop in\nJanuary 2012. Cliressa noted that she was working approximately twenty hours a\nweek, making $7.25 an hour. Cliressa further noted that her current job was the\nfirst job she had had in ten years and that it was the only one she could find.\nCliressa stated that she expected her monthly expenses after the divorce to be\n$8,000 and asked the court to award her spousal maintenance for a term of five\n\n\n          2\n          The parties disagreed as to what year their last sexual encounter occurred. Ronald believed that\nhe last had sex with his wife in 2004, and Cliressa claimed that the encounter occurred in 2006.\n          3\n          Ronald initially testified that the affair began in 2007 but later stated that it began in late 2006.\nIn his responses to Cliressa’s interrogatories, Ronald indicated that the affair began in 2005.\n                                                      3\n\fyears and $3,000 in monthly child support. Cliressa also asked the court to award\nher attorney’s fees and the marital residence.\n      Cliressa claimed that Ronald wasted money on extravagances, such as\nalcohol and trips to Las Vegas. Cliressa also claimed that Ronald never asked her\nor the children to come see him and that she would have visited him more\nfrequently had she been invited.      Cliressa stated that she had not had sexual\nrelations with Ronald since 2006. Cliressa noted that Ronald tried to initiate\nsexual relations after that point but that she refused. Cliressa explained that she\nwas not aware of her husband’s affair until after he filed for divorce.\n      At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Jones granted the parties’ divorce and\nentered interlocutory orders regarding the custody of the couple’s minor children.\nJudge Jones took the other matters, including the amount of child support, the\ndivision of the couple’s property, and the question of spousal maintenance, under\nadvisement.\n      On May 25, 2012, Judge Jones sent the parties a letter that ordered Ronald to\npay Cliressa $1,000 in monthly maintenance for a term of one year and $2,250 in\nmonthly child support. The letter also ordered the sale of the couple’s marital\nresidence and other real property in order to satisfy the debts of the marriage.\nJudge Jones later entered a final decree of divorce that dissolved the parties’\nmarriage and confirmed his previous orders.\n                                 II. Issues Presented\n      Cliressa asserts in five issues that (1) the final decree of divorce is voidable\nbecause it was entered by a visiting judge subject to an objection under Section\n74.053 of the Texas Government Code, (2) the trial court improperly set child\nsupport at a rate below the guidelines provided by Chapter 154 of the Texas\nFamily Code, (3) the trial court established spousal maintenance at an arbitrary\namount and time without regard for the provisions of Chapter 8 of the Texas\n                                          4\n\fFamily Code, (4) the property division was neither just nor right, and (5) the trial\ncourt’s decision to allow Ronald to pay his attorney’s fees using community\nproperty funds was an unfair and unjust division of the community property.\n                              III. Standard of Review\n      The question of whether the assignment of a judge is subject to objection is\nbased solely on the interpretation of the applicable rules and statutes. A trial\ncourt’s construction of a statute is reviewed de novo. Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.\nSummers, 282 S.W.3d 433, 437 (Tex. 2009).\n      The trial court has broad discretion in setting the amount of child support,\nand a child support order will not be disturbed on appeal unless the complaining\nparty shows a clear abuse of discretion. Worford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109\n(Tex. 1990).    A trial court’s decision to award spousal maintenance is also\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion. Tellez v. Tellez, 345 S.W.3d 689, 691 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas 2011, no pet.). A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts\nwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.      Downer v. Aquamarine\nOperators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985).\n      We will not reverse a property division unless the complainant shows that\nthe trial court clearly abused its discretion. In re Marriage of Taylor, 992 S.W.2d\n616, 620 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, no pet.). We examine the issue through\napplication of a two-pronged inquiry that asks (1) whether the trial court had\nsufficient information upon which it could exercise its discretion and (2) whether\nthe trial court abused its discretion by making a division of the property that was\nmanifestly unjust or unfair. Evans v. Evans, 14 S.W.3d 343, 346 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n      Legal and factual sufficiency issues are not independent grounds of error but\nare relevant factors to consider in determining whether an abuse of discretion has\n\n\n                                         5\n\foccurred. Doyle v. Doyle, 955 S.W.2d 478, 479 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, no\npet.).\n                                       IV. Analysis\n         A. Objection to Assigned Judge\n         Cliressa contends in her first issue that the final decree of divorce is voidable\nbecause it was entered by a visiting judge whose assignment she objected to under\nSection 74.053 of the Texas Government Code. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §\n74.053 (West 2013). Section 74.053 provides that, if a party to a civil case files a\ntimely objection to a judge’s assignment, the judge shall not hear the case. See id.\n         On June 30, 2012, after conducting the trial but prior to signing the decree,\nJudge Jones retired from his position as judge of the 266th District Court of Erath\nCounty. On July 2, 2012, Judge Jones was assigned, in accordance with Section\n74.056 of the Texas Government Code, to serve as a judge of the 266th District\nCourt for a period of five days. On July 3, 2012, Judge Jones issued a final decree\nof divorce that dissolved the parties’ marriage and confirmed the orders contained\nin his May 25 letter.\n         Judge Jones heard and decided this case prior to the date he retired. While\nserving as an assigned judge in this case, Judge Jones performed only the\n“ministerial act” of entering the final decree of divorce. See Dunn v. Dunn, 439\nS.W.2d 830, 832 (Tex. 1969) (stating that “the entry of a trial judgment is only a\nministerial act.”). Because Judge Jones did not hear any portion of this case while\nserving as an assigned judge, we hold that Cliressa’s objection did not prevent\nJudge Jones from issuing the final decree of divorce. See GOV’T § 74.053(b);\nTurner v. Turner, No. 11-10-00192-CV, 2012 WL 3115155, at *4 (Tex. App.—\nEastland July 31, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.). We overrule Cliressa’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f      B. Child Support\n      Cliressa claims in her second issue that the trial court improperly set the\namount of child support below the guidelines set out in Chapter 154 of the Texas\nFamily Code. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 154.125(b) (West 2014). Section\n154.125(b) of the Texas Family Code provides child support guidelines that are to\nbe applied by the trial court in situations in which the obligor’s monthly net\nresources are not greater than $7,500. Id. § 154.125(a). In situations where the\nobligor’s monthly net resources are greater than $7,500, the court is to apply the\npercentage guidelines to only that portion of the obligor’s net resources that does\nnot exceed $7,500. Id. The court may order additional amounts of child support as\nappropriate, depending on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the\nchild. Id.\n      We begin our review of the child support order in this case by determining if\nthe order complied with the applicable guidelines. Based on the guidelines set out\nin Section 154.125(b), Ronald, being an obligor with three children, is required to\npay child support in an amount equivalent to 30% of his net resources.           Id.\n§ 154.125(b). Evidence adduced at trial showed that Ronald had a monthly net\nincome of approximately $10,000. According to Section 154.126(a), the trial court\nwas permitted to apply the percentage set by the guidelines to only $7,500 of\nRonald’s monthly net resources. Id. § 154.126(a). Thirty percent of $7,500 is\n$2,250, and $2,250 is the amount of monthly child support the trial court ordered\nRonald to pay. Therefore, we find that the trial court followed the guidelines set\nout in Chapter 154 of the Texas Family Code when it set child support in this case.\n      We now turn to the question of whether Cliressa was entitled to child\nsupport above the amount set by the statutory guidelines. See id. Cliressa claims\nthat she was entitled to additional child support under Section 154.126(a) because\n\n\n                                         7\n\fof (1) the gross disparity in her and Ronald’s income and (2) the high amount of\nmonthly expenses she endures in caring for her children.\n      Section 154.126(a) states that a trial court may require an obligor to pay\nchild support above the level set by the guidelines as appropriate, taking into\nconsideration the parties’ income and the children’s proven needs.             Cliressa\ninterprets the statute’s use of the phrase “the parties’ income” to mean that a court\nshould consider the disparity of the parents’ income when making a determination\nunder Section 154.126(a). We interpret “the parties’ income” as used in this\nsection to simply refer to the amount of income each parent has to contribute to the\ncare of his or her children.\n      We next move to Cliressa’s claim that she is entitled to child support above\nthe amount set by the guidelines because she established that her children’s proven\nmonthly needs amount to $8,807. The trial court determines the needs of a child\non a case-by-case basis by following the paramount guiding principle: the “best\ninterests” of the child. Scott v. Younts, 926 S.W.2d 415, 421 (Tex. App.—Corpus\nChristi 1996, writ denied). Although a child’s needs are not limited to “the bare\nnecessities of life,” a trial court is not permitted to consider “lifestyle” evidence in\ndetermining whether an obligor should be required to pay additional child support.\nSee Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, 860 S.W.2d 414, 417 n.3 (Tex. 1993) (holding that the\n“needs of the child” are not determined by the parents’ ability to pay or the\nlifestyle of the family); In re Marriage of Thurmond, 888 S.W.2d 269, 278 (Tex.\nApp.—Amarillo 1994, writ denied) (recognizing that “lifestyle” could not be\nconsidered when awarding child support beyond the presumptive level in cases\nwhere the obligor’s income rose above the statutorily designated income level).\n      Cliressa testified that her children attend public school and suffer from no\ndisabilities. Although Cliressa claimed it cost over $8,000 a month to raise her\nthree children, she did not support that claim with an itemized list of the children’s\n                                           8\n\fexpenses. See Lide v. Lide, 116 S.W.3d 147, 158 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2003, no\npet.) (stating that a child’s needs must be supported by evidence and must be\nexplained or itemized). The monthly budget Cliressa submitted into evidence\nshowed only the general expenses of her entire family. Thus, the budget did not\nestablish the proven needs of the children.         See Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 158\n(recognizing that living expenses of mother that was to receive child support were\nrequired to be segregated from the proven needs of her children).\n       Cliressa testified that she wanted to continue to live in her home and be able\nto take her children to and from school and attend all of their extracurricular\nactivities.   The trial court was not permitted to consider these “lifestyle”\npreferences when deciding if Ronald should be required to pay additional child\nsupport. See Rodriguez, 860 S.W.2d at 417 n.3; Thurmond, 888 S.W.2d at 278.\n       We hold that Cliressa has failed to show that the proven needs of her\nchildren require $8,807 a month. Even if Cliressa had established that the proven\nneeds of her children rose to that amount, it was within the trial court’s discretion\nto refuse to award child support above the amount set by the guidelines. See FAM.\n§ 154.126(a); Nordstrom v. Nordstrom, 965 S.W.2d 575, 581 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. denied) (noting that court was permitted to deny\nrequest for additional child support based on a finding that evidence was\nunpersuasive or that the amounts allocated to the child were excessive). We hold\nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to require Ronald to\npay child support in excess of the amount set by the guidelines provided in Section\n154.125(b). See FAM. § 154.125(b). We overrule Cliressa’s second issue.\n       C. Spousal Maintenance\n       Cliressa complains in her third issue that the trial court set her monthly\nspousal maintenance award at an arbitrary amount for an arbitrary period of time.\nCliressa argues that many factors, including Ronald’s long-standing affair and\n                                          9\n\fspending habits, the disparity in the parties’ incomes, the parties’ decision that she\nshould be a stay-at-home mother, and the length of the marriage, show that she\nshould have been awarded $2,500 monthly maintenance for a term of five years.\n       The purpose of spousal maintenance is to provide temporary and\nrehabilitative support for a spouse whose ability to support herself has eroded over\ntime while engaged in homemaking activities and whose capital assets are\ninsufficient to provide support. Deltuva v. Deltuva, 113 S.W.3d 882, 888 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas 2003, no pet.). With the exception of situations not applicable here,\na trial court may order spousal maintenance in a marriage that lasted ten years or\nmore if the spouse seeking maintenance lacks sufficient property to provide for his\nor her minimum reasonable needs.            See FAM. § 8.051(2) (West Supp. 2013).\nAssessing the minimum reasonable needs of a particular individual is a fact-\nspecific determination that should be made by the trial court on a case-by-case\nbasis. In re Marriage of Hale, 975 S.W.2d 694, 698 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1998,\nno pet.).\n       The record in this case shows that Cliressa attended college for three years\nand completed massage therapy school. Sometime around the birth of her second\nchild, Cliressa chose to quit her job and be a stay-at-home mother. Cliressa served\nher family as a homemaker for the ten years that followed. Cliressa testified that\nshe was forty-two years old and that she worked approximately twenty hours a\nweek as a waitress, making $7.25 an hour. Cliressa testified that she was interested\nin taking medical transcription classes that would allow her to obtain a job paying\n$1,500 or $2,000 a month. The trial court was authorized to consider Cliressa’s\ntestimony in determining the amount of maintenance she was to receive. See\nWright v. Wright, 280 S.W.3d 901, 908 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2009, no pet.)\n(stating that the trial court, as the trier of fact, is “the sole judge of the credibility of\nthe witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony”).\n                                             10\n\f      The monthly budget Cliressa adduced as evidence failed to itemize her\nindividual living expenses and, instead, showed only the general expenses of her\nentire family.   Cliressa claimed that her family’s monthly expenses equaled\n$8,807. Deducting Cliressa’s monthly income of approximately $400 and monthly\nchild support of $2,250 from her claimed expenses leaves a shortfall of $6,157.\nCliressa argues that this shortfall entitles her to an increase in monthly\nmaintenance. We disagree. Just because Cliressa’s maintenance and child support\npayments are insufficient to satisfy her expenses does not automatically entitle her\nto a larger maintenance award. See Tellez, 345 S.W.3d at 692 (rejecting wife’s\nargument that her maintenance should be increased because it was insufficient to\neliminate her monthly shortfall).    While courts frequently consider a party’s\nmonthly expenses, income, and any shortfall in determining whether a spousal\nmaintenance award is proper, there is no requirement that a spousal maintenance\naward eliminate the shortfall. See FAM. § 8.051; Deltuva, 113 S.W.3d at 888\n($2,757 monthly shortfall; $650 monthly maintenance); Yarbrough v. Yarbrough,\n151 S.W.3d 687, 692 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.) ($2,600 monthly shortfall;\n$1,329 monthly maintenance).\n      We also reject Cliressa’s claim that the trial court should have extended the\nduration of her maintenance award. Unless a specified exception applies, a trial\ncourt is required to limit the duration of a maintenance order “to the shortest\nreasonable period that allows the spouse seeking maintenance to earn sufficient\nincome to provide for the spouse’s minimum reasonable needs” by obtaining\nappropriate employment or developing an appropriate skill. FAM. § 8.054(a)(2);\nsee Amos v. Amos, 79 S.W.3d 747, 750 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.).\nBased on the evidence presented, the trial court could have reasonably concluded\nthat a year’s worth of monthly maintenance payments was sufficient time for\n\n\n                                        11\n\fCliressa to obtain appropriate employment or develop an appropriate skill to\nsupport herself.\n      We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it set Cliressa’s\nmonthly maintenance award at $1,000 for a term of one year. The trial court’s\ndecision complies with the applicable statute, and there was some evidence to\nsupport it. See In re Marriage of McFarland, 176 S.W.3d 650, 656 (Tex. App.—\nTexarkana 2005, no pet.) (stating that “the trial court does not abuse its discretion\nif there is some evidence of a substantive and probative character to support the\ndecision”). We overrule Cliressa’s third issue.\n      D. Property Division\n      Cliressa contends in her fourth issue that the trial court’s property division\nwas neither just nor right. See FAM. § 7.001 (West 2006) (“In a decree of divorce\nor annulment, the court shall order a division of the estate of the parties in a\nmanner that the court deems just and right, having due regard for the rights of each\nparty and any children of the marriage.”). Cliressa argues that she should have\nbeen awarded a larger share of the community estate given Ronald’s long-standing\naffair and his excessive spending.\n      The trial court did not prepare findings of fact in this case, and the divorce\ndecree does not provide values for any of the assets or debts assigned to each party.\nAs the challenger of the court’s division of the parties’ property, it was Cliressa’s\nresponsibility to provide us with the evidence necessary for us to review the\nproperty division. See Taylor, 992 S.W.2d at 620 (“A presumption arises on\nappeal that the trial court correctly exercised its discretion in dividing property in a\ndivorce proceeding, and the burden rests on the Cliressa to show from the record\nthat the division was so disproportionate, and thus unjust and unfair, as to\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.”). When findings of fact and conclusions of law\nare not requested or filed, the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed if it can\n                                          12\n\fbe upheld on any legal theory that finds support in the evidence. Balboa Ins. Co. v.\nSnyder Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 574 S.W.2d 879, 880 (Tex. Civ. App.—Eastland\n1978, no writ) (citing Bishop v. Bishop, 359 S.W.2d 869, 871 (Tex. 1962)). If the\ntrial court files no findings of fact and conclusions of law, all findings necessary to\nthe court’s judgment, if supported by the record, will be implied. Vickery v.\nComm’n for Lawyer Discipline, 5 S.W.3d 241, 251 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied).\n      Cliressa claims that the trial court awarded Ronald $10,000 more of the\ncommunity estate than it awarded her. She does not point out where she thinks the\ncourt awarded more property. We note that, if the items listed for assets and\nliabilities in Trial Exhibit “A” are divided as the trial court ordered in the final\njudgment and are given the values attributed to them by Ronald, the difference\nbetween Cliressa’s net share and Ronald’s net share is approximately $10,000.\nThe trial court has wide discretion in dividing the estate of the parties, and that\ndivision should be corrected on appeal only when an abuse of discretion has been\nshown. Murff v. Murff, 615 S.W.2d 696, 698 (Tex. 1981) (citing Hedtke v. Hedtke,\n248 S.W. 21 (Tex. 1923)). “These cases further indicate that the trial court may\nconsider such factors as the spouses’ capacities and abilities, benefits which the\nparty not at fault would have derived from continuation of the marriage, business\nopportunities, education, relative physical conditions, relative financial condition\nand obligations, disparity of ages, size of separate estates, and the nature of the\nproperty.” Id. at 699.\n      We note that the trial court awarded the Honda vehicle, which was used by\nthe parties’ adult daughter, to Ronald and that the net equity in the vehicle was\napproximately $9,370.42, which was nearly the same amount as the alleged net\ndifference in the property division. Ronald testified that he intended to give the\nHonda vehicle to his daughter and that it was purchased for her use. Ronald\n                                          13\n\fagreed to take the debt or liability on that vehicle. Ronald’s testimony about the\nHonda, his willingness to take the debt, and his intentions to give the asset to his\ndaughter were uncontroverted and drew no objection from Cliressa. Thus, the\nalleged difference in the property division is $10,000, and the equity for the Honda\nused by the daughter is approximately the same. Absent that equity, the parties’\nnet shares appear to be almost identical; therefore, we cannot say that the trial court\nabused its discretion when it made the property division that it did. We overrule\nCliressa’s fourth issue.\n       E. Attorney’s Fees\n       Cliressa complains in her final issue that the trial court abused its discretion\nwhen it allowed Ronald to pay his attorney’s fees with community property.\nCliressa argues that the court’s decision resulted in an unfair and unjust division of\nthe marital property.\n       At the time the final decree of divorce was issued in this case, a trial court\ndid not have inherent authority to award attorney’s fees in a divorce action. 4 See\nWright, 280 S.W.3d at 914. Instead, attorney’s fees related to the trial and appeal\nof a divorce were treated as part and parcel of the property division. Id. Thus, we\ntreat Cliressa’s complaint regarding attorney’s fees as a challenge to the court’s\ndivision of the parties’ property.\n       The divorce decree in this case stated that each party was to be responsible\nfor his or her own attorney’s fees. Cliressa claims that the trial court’s order\nresulted in Ronald receiving a larger share of the community property because\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         In 2013, the Texas Legislature amended TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 6.708 to give trial courts\nauthority to award reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses in a divorce proceeding. FAM. § 6.708(c).\nBecause we are bound to apply the law as it existed at the time the divorce decree was signed, Section\n6.708(c) does not apply to this case. See Sadler v. Sadler, 769 S.W.2d 886, 887 (Tex. 1989).\n\n                                                 14\n\fRonald paid his attorney’s fees before the final divorce decree was issued, using\ncommunity funds.5\n         As previously mentioned, Cliressa has not provided us with the specific\nvalues of the assets awarded to each party in this case. 6 Thus, we hold that\nCliressa has failed to establish that the trial court awarded Ronald more than 50%\nof the community property. Consequently, we do not review her claim that the\ntrial court erred when it awarded Ronald a larger share of the community property.\n         We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered\neach party to pay his or her own attorney’s fees in this case. The trial court\nfollowed the general rule, and Cliressa has not shown that the court’s decision was\nerror. See Wright, 280 S.W.3d at 915 (“The general rule in Texas is that each party\nis responsible for his or her own attorney’s fees.”). We overrule Cliressa’s fifth\nissue.\n                                      V. This Court’s Ruling\n         We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        MIKE WILLSON\n                                                                        JUSTICE\nAugust 21, 2014\nPanel consists of: Wright, C.J.,\nWillson, J., and Bailey, J.\n\n         5\n         Ronald stated at the hearing that he paid his attorney $12,000.00 in fees before the divorce was\nfinalized, using a portion of his income. We note that, absent some deception or objection by Cliressa,\nRonald was free to make expenditures of the couple’s community property. See Pelzig v. Berkebile, 931\nS.W.2d 398, 400 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1996, no pet.). There is no evidence in the record to\nsuggest that Cliressa was unaware that Ronald was using community funds to pay his attorney or that she\nobjected to the expenditures at the time they were made.\n         6\n        Cliressa claims that she was awarded $93,678.46 in community property and that Ronald was\nawarded $128, 632.62 in community property.\n                                                  15\n\f",

A short time later,\nthe trial court determined child support obligations, awarded spousal maintenance,\ndivided the couple’s assets and liabilities, and entered a final judgment. In five\nissues on appeal, Appellant, Cliressa Brown, challenges the judgment of the trial\n\fcourt on (1) the denial of her objection to the trial judge, (2) the award of child\nsupport, (3) the award of spousal maintenance, (4) the division of property, and (5)\nRonald’s use of community funds to pay his attorney’s fees. We affirm.\n                                       I. Evidence at Trial\n      Cliressa and Ronald married on June 17, 1998. On September 29, 2011,\nRonald filed an original petition for divorce. In response, Cliressa answered and\nfiled a counter-petition for divorce. On May 15, 2012, the Honorable Donald R.\nJones held a bench trial on their respective petitions.\n      Ronald testified that he and Cliressa had one adult child and three minor\nchildren.1 Shortly after the couple’s first child was born in 1992, Ronald asked\nCliressa to marry him, but she refused. Ronald then moved to Tennessee and\nbegan working as a mechanical planner and field engineer. Cliressa and Ronald\nlater reconciled, and Ronald briefly moved back to Texas in 1995.                                Because\nRonald made substantially less money working in Texas, he and Cliressa decided\nthat he would go back to work “on the road.”\n      Cliressa and Ronald eventually married in 1998 but continued to live apart.\nOver the course of the next decade, Cliressa cared for the couple’s children in\nTexas while Ronald worked in Tennessee, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ontario, Florida,\nand Arizona. During the time that he was away, Ronald sent Cliressa $4,000 every\ntwo weeks until 2009, and from then on, $3,700 every two weeks.\n      Ronald began working in Florida again in 2011 and was working there at the\ntime of the trial. Ronald explained that he worked twelve hours a day, six to seven\ndays a week. Ronald’s income tax return showed that he made a gross income of\n$178,901.75 in 2011, and Ronald stated that he was making a comparable income\nat the time of the trial. Ronald noted that he and Cliressa had substantial marital\ndebts, including the mortgage on their house in Texas and unpaid balances on two\n\n      1\n       Cliressa does not challenge the trial court’s order as to custody and visitation of the children.\n                                                    2\n\fvehicles and several credit cards. Ronald asked the court to order the sale of the\ncouple’s property in Texas in order to help pay the marital debts.\n          Ronald claimed that Cliressa refused to move with their children to any of\nhis locations. Ronald also claimed that neither Cliressa nor his children ever\nvisited him while he was working away from them. On cross-examination, Ronald\nrecalled that Cliressa once came to see him in Ontario and brought the couple’s\ntwo oldest children.\nRonald stated that he had felt alienated from his wife since 2004 and that she only\ncalled him when she needed money. Ronald noted that he and Cliressa had not had\nsexual relations since shortly after the birth of their last child and that Cliressa had\nrefused his attempts to initiate sexual relations after that point. 2\n          Ronald admitted that he had been having sexual relations with another\nwoman since 2006 or 2007.3 Ronald stated that he did not tell Cliressa about the\naffair.\n          Cliressa testified that, although she received over $90,000 each year from\nRonald, she struggled financially. Cliressa stated that she does not travel or spend\nmoney on herself and that she cuts her own hair and her children’s hair to save\nmoney. Cliressa explained that she began working as a waitress in a soda shop in\nJanuary 2012. Cliressa noted that she was working approximately twenty hours a\nweek, making $7.25 an hour. Cliressa further noted that her current job was the\nfirst job she had had in ten years and that it was the only one she could find.\nCliressa stated that she expected her monthly expenses after the divorce to be\n$8,000 and asked the court to award her spousal maintenance for a term of five\n\n\n          2\n          The parties disagreed as to what year their last sexual encounter occurred. Ronald believed that\nhe last had sex with his wife in 2004, and Cliressa claimed that the encounter occurred in 2006.\n          3\n          Ronald initially testified that the affair began in 2007 but later stated that it began in late 2006.\nIn his responses to Cliressa’s interrogatories, Ronald indicated that the affair began in 2005.\n                                                      3\n\fyears and $3,000 in monthly child support. Cliressa also asked the court to award\nher attorney’s fees and the marital residence.\n      Cliressa claimed that Ronald wasted money on extravagances, such as\nalcohol and trips to Las Vegas. Cliressa also claimed that Ronald never asked her\nor the children to come see him and that she would have visited him more\nfrequently had she been invited.      Cliressa stated that she had not had sexual\nrelations with Ronald since 2006. Cliressa noted that Ronald tried to initiate\nsexual relations after that point but that she refused. Cliressa explained that she\nwas not aware of her husband’s affair until after he filed for divorce.\n      At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Jones granted the parties’ divorce and\nentered interlocutory orders regarding the custody of the couple’s minor children.\nJudge Jones took the other matters, including the amount of child support, the\ndivision of the couple’s property, and the question of spousal maintenance, under\nadvisement.\n      On May 25, 2012, Judge Jones sent the parties a letter that ordered Ronald to\npay Cliressa $1,000 in monthly maintenance for a term of one year and $2,250 in\nmonthly child support. The letter also ordered the sale of the couple’s marital\nresidence and other real property in order to satisfy the debts of the marriage.\nJudge Jones later entered a final decree of divorce that dissolved the parties’\nmarriage and confirmed his previous orders.\n                                 II. Issues Presented\n      Cliressa asserts in five issues that (1) the final decree of divorce is voidable\nbecause it was entered by a visiting judge subject to an objection under Section\n74.053 of the Texas Government Code, (2) the trial court improperly set child\nsupport at a rate below the guidelines provided by Chapter 154 of the Texas\nFamily Code, (3) the trial court established spousal maintenance at an arbitrary\namount and time without regard for the provisions of Chapter 8 of the Texas\n                                          4\n\fFamily Code, (4) the property division was neither just nor right, and (5) the trial\ncourt’s decision to allow Ronald to pay his attorney’s fees using community\nproperty funds was an unfair and unjust division of the community property.\n                              III. Standard of Review\n      The question of whether the assignment of a judge is subject to objection is\nbased solely on the interpretation of the applicable rules and statutes. A trial\ncourt’s construction of a statute is reviewed de novo.

Objection to Assigned Judge\n         Cliressa contends in her first issue that the final decree of divorce is voidable\nbecause it was entered by a visiting judge whose assignment she objected to under\nSection 74.053 of the Texas Government Code. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §\n74.053 (West 2013). Section 74.053 provides that, if a party to a civil case files a\ntimely objection to a judge’s assignment, the judge shall not hear the case. See id.\n         On June 30, 2012, after conducting the trial but prior to signing the decree,\nJudge Jones retired from his position as judge of the 266th District Court of Erath\nCounty. On July 2, 2012, Judge Jones was assigned, in accordance with Section\n74.056 of the Texas Government Code, to serve as a judge of the 266th District\nCourt for a period of five days. On July 3, 2012, Judge Jones issued a final decree\nof divorce that dissolved the parties’ marriage and confirmed the orders contained\nin his May 25 letter.\n         Judge Jones heard and decided this case prior to the date he retired. While\nserving as an assigned judge in this case, Judge Jones performed only the\n“ministerial act” of entering the final decree of divorce. See Dunn v. Dunn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459219\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459219/dunn-v-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (Tex. 1969) (stating that “the entry of a trial judgment is only a\nministerial act.”). Because Judge Jones did not hear any portion of this case while\nserving as an assigned judge, we hold that Cliressa’s objection did not prevent\nJudge Jones from issuing the final decree of divorce. See GOV’T § 74.053(b);\nTurner v. Turner, No. 11-10-00192-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3115155</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tex. App.—\nEastland July 31, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.). We overrule Cliressa’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f      B. Child Support\n      Cliressa claims in her second issue that the trial court improperly set the\namount of child support below the guidelines set out in Chapter 154 of the Texas\nFamily Code. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 154.125(b) (West 2014). Section\n154.125(b) of the Texas Family Code provides child support guidelines that are to\nbe applied by the trial court in situations in which the obligor’s monthly net\nresources are not greater than $7,500. Id. § 154.125(a). In situations where the\nobligor’s monthly net resources are greater than $7,500, the court is to apply the\npercentage guidelines to only that portion of the obligor’s net resources that does\nnot exceed $7,500. Id. The court may order additional amounts of child support as\nappropriate, depending on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the\nchild. Id.\n      We begin our review of the child support order in this case by determining if\nthe order complied with the applicable guidelines. Based on the guidelines set out\nin Section 154.125(b), Ronald, being an obligor with three children, is required to\npay child support in an amount equivalent to 30% of his net resources.           Id.\n§ 154.125(b). Evidence adduced at trial showed that Ronald had a monthly net\nincome of approximately $10,000. According to Section 154.126(a), the trial court\nwas permitted to apply the percentage set by the guidelines to only $7,500 of\nRonald’s monthly net resources. Id. § 154.126(a). Thirty percent of $7,500 is\n$2,250, and $2,250 is the amount of monthly child support the trial court ordered\nRonald to pay. Therefore, we find that the trial court followed the guidelines set\nout in Chapter 154 of the Texas Family Code when it set child support in this case.\n      We now turn to the question of whether Cliressa was entitled to child\nsupport above the amount set by the statutory guidelines. See id. Cliressa claims\nthat she was entitled to additional child support under Section 154.126(a) because\n\n\n                                         7\n\fof (1) the gross disparity in her and Ronald’s income and (2) the high amount of\nmonthly expenses she endures in caring for her children.\n      Section 154.126(a) states that a trial court may require an obligor to pay\nchild support above the level set by the guidelines as appropriate, taking into\nconsideration the parties’ income and the children’s proven needs.             Cliressa\ninterprets the statute’s use of the phrase “the parties’ income” to mean that a court\nshould consider the disparity of the parents’ income when making a determination\nunder Section 154.126(a). We interpret “the parties’ income” as used in this\nsection to simply refer to the amount of income each parent has to contribute to the\ncare of his or her children.\n      We next move to Cliressa’s claim that she is entitled to child support above\nthe amount set by the guidelines because she established that her children’s proven\nmonthly needs amount to $8,807. The trial court determines the needs of a child\non a case-by-case basis by following the paramount guiding principle: the “best\ninterests” of the child. Scott v.

Although Cliressa claimed it cost over $8,000 a month to raise her\nthree children, she did not support that claim with an itemized list of the children’s\n                                           8\n\fexpenses.

See Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 158\n(recognizing that living expenses of mother that was to receive child support were\nrequired to be segregated from the proven needs of her children).\n       Cliressa testified that she wanted to continue to live in her home and be able\nto take her children to and from school and attend all of their extracurricular\nactivities.

With the exception of situations not applicable here,\na trial court may order spousal maintenance in a marriage that lasted ten years or\nmore if the spouse seeking maintenance lacks sufficient property to provide for his\nor her minimum reasonable needs.            See FAM. § 8.051(2) (West Supp. 2013).\nAssessing the minimum reasonable needs of a particular individual is a fact-\nspecific determination that should be made by the trial court on a case-by-case\nbasis.

App.—Texarkana 1998,\nno pet.).\n       The record in this case shows that Cliressa attended college for three years\nand completed massage therapy school. Sometime around the birth of her second\nchild, Cliressa chose to quit her job and be a stay-at-home mother. Cliressa served\nher family as a homemaker for the ten years that followed. Cliressa testified that\nshe was forty-two years old and that she worked approximately twenty hours a\nweek as a waitress, making $7.25 an hour. Cliressa testified that she was interested\nin taking medical transcription classes that would allow her to obtain a job paying\n$1,500 or $2,000 a month. The trial court was authorized to consider Cliressa’s\ntestimony in determining the amount of maintenance she was to receive. See\nWright v. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1589347\"><a href=\"/opinion/1589347/wright-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 908 (Tex.

Cliressa claimed that her family’s monthly expenses equaled\n$8,807. Deducting Cliressa’s monthly income of approximately $400 and monthly\nchild support of $2,250 from her claimed expenses leaves a shortfall of $6,157.\nCliressa argues that this shortfall entitles her to an increase in monthly\nmaintenance. We disagree. Just because Cliressa’s maintenance and child support\npayments are insufficient to satisfy her expenses does not automatically entitle her\nto a larger maintenance award. See Tellez, 345 S.W.3d at 692 (rejecting wife’s\nargument that her maintenance should be increased because it was insufficient to\neliminate her monthly shortfall).    While courts frequently consider a party’s\nmonthly expenses, income, and any shortfall in determining whether a spousal\nmaintenance award is proper, there is no requirement that a spousal maintenance\naward eliminate the shortfall. See FAM. § 8.051; Deltuva, 113 S.W.3d at 888\n($2,757 monthly shortfall; $650 monthly maintenance); Yarbrough v.

App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.) ($2,600 monthly shortfall;\n$1,329 monthly maintenance).\n      We also reject Cliressa’s claim that the trial court should have extended the\nduration of her maintenance award. Unless a specified exception applies, a trial\ncourt is required to limit the duration of a maintenance order “to the shortest\nreasonable period that allows the spouse seeking maintenance to earn sufficient\nincome to provide for the spouse’s minimum reasonable needs” by obtaining\nappropriate employment or developing an appropriate skill.

The trial court’s\ndecision complies with the applicable statute, and there was some evidence to\nsupport it. See In re Marriage of McFarland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488504/in-re-marriage-of-mcfarland/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (Tex. App.—\nTexarkana 2005, no pet.) (stating that “the trial court does not abuse its discretion\nif there is some evidence of a substantive and probative character to support the\ndecision”). We overrule Cliressa’s third issue.\n      D. Property Division\n      Cliressa contends in her fourth issue that the trial court’s property division\nwas neither just nor right. See FAM. § 7.001 (West 2006) (“In a decree of divorce\nor annulment, the court shall order a division of the estate of the parties in a\nmanner that the court deems just and right, having due regard for the rights of each\nparty and any children of the marriage.”). Cliressa argues that she should have\nbeen awarded a larger share of the community estate given Ronald’s long-standing\naffair and his excessive spending.\n      The trial court did not prepare findings of fact in this case, and the divorce\ndecree does not provide values for any of the assets or debts assigned to each party.\nAs the challenger of the court’s division of the parties’ property, it was Cliressa’s\nresponsibility to provide us with the evidence necessary for us to review the\nproperty division. See Taylor, 992 S.W.2d at 620 (“A presumption arises on\nappeal that the trial court correctly exercised its discretion in dividing property in a\ndivorce proceeding, and the burden rests on the Cliressa to show from the record\nthat the division was so disproportionate, and thus unjust and unfair, as to\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.”). When findings of fact and conclusions of law\nare not requested or filed, the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed if it can\n                                          12\n\fbe upheld on any legal theory that finds support in the evidence.

App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied).\n      Cliressa claims that the trial court awarded Ronald $10,000 more of the\ncommunity estate than it awarded her. She does not point out where she thinks the\ncourt awarded more property. We note that, if the items listed for assets and\nliabilities in Trial Exhibit “A” are divided as the trial court ordered in the final\njudgment and are given the values attributed to them by Ronald, the difference\nbetween Cliressa’s net share and Ronald’s net share is approximately $10,000.\nThe trial court has wide discretion in dividing the estate of the parties, and that\ndivision should be corrected on appeal only when an abuse of discretion has been\nshown. Murff v. Murff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449637/murff-v-murff/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698 (Tex. 1981) (citing Hedtke v.

Ronald testified that he intended to give the\nHonda vehicle to his daughter and that it was purchased for her use. Ronald\n                                          13\n\fagreed to take the debt or liability on that vehicle. Ronald’s testimony about the\nHonda, his willingness to take the debt, and his intentions to give the asset to his\ndaughter were uncontroverted and drew no objection from Cliressa. Thus, the\nalleged difference in the property division is $10,000, and the equity for the Honda\nused by the daughter is approximately the same. Absent that equity, the parties’\nnet shares appear to be almost identical; therefore, we cannot say that the trial court\nabused its discretion when it made the property division that it did. We overrule\nCliressa’s fourth issue.\n       E. Attorney’s Fees\n       Cliressa complains in her final issue that the trial court abused its discretion\nwhen it allowed Ronald to pay his attorney’s fees with community property.\nCliressa argues that the court’s decision resulted in an unfair and unjust division of\nthe marital property.\n       At the time the final decree of divorce was issued in this case, a trial court\ndid not have inherent authority to award attorney’s fees in a divorce action. 4 See\nWright, 280 S.W.3d at 914. Instead, attorney’s fees related to the trial and appeal\nof a divorce were treated as part and parcel of the property division. Id. Thus, we\ntreat Cliressa’s complaint regarding attorney’s fees as a challenge to the court’s\ndivision of the parties’ property.\n       The divorce decree in this case stated that each party was to be responsible\nfor his or her own attorney’s fees. Cliressa claims that the trial court’s order\nresulted in Ronald receiving a larger share of the community property because\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         In 2013, the Texas Legislature amended TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 6.708 to give trial courts\nauthority to award reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses in a divorce proceeding. FAM. § 6.708(c).\nBecause we are bound to apply the law as it existed at the time the divorce decree was signed, Section\n6.708(c) does not apply to this case. See Sadler v. Sadler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624815\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624815/sadler-v-sadler/\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 887 (Tex. 1989).\n\n                                                 14\n\fRonald paid his attorney’s fees before the final divorce decree was issued, using\ncommunity funds.5\n         As previously mentioned, Cliressa has not provided us with the specific\nvalues of the assets awarded to each party in this case. 6 Thus, we hold that\nCliressa has failed to establish that the trial court awarded Ronald more than 50%\nof the community property. Consequently, we do not review her claim that the\ntrial court erred when it awarded Ronald a larger share of the community property.\n         We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered\neach party to pay his or her own attorney’s fees in this case. The trial court\nfollowed the general rule, and Cliressa has not shown that the court’s decision was\nerror. See Wright, 280 S.W.3d at 915 (“The general rule in Texas is that each party\nis responsible for his or her own attorney’s fees.”). We overrule Cliressa’s fifth\nissue.\n                                      V.
