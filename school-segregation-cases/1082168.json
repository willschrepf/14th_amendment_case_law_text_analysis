We reverse the Court\n\n of Appeals’ judgment because a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\fsystem (the system) that remits funds to a segregated fund is not precluded by any\n\nprohibition in MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.\n\n        MCL 169.257(1), commonly referred to as § 57 of the Michigan Campaign\n\nFinance Act (MCFA),1 specifically prohibits a public body from using public resources to\n\ndo three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a contribution, and (3) “provide\n\nvolunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under\n\nsection 4(3)(a)” of the MCFA, MCL 169.204(3)(a).2 First, the administration of such a\n\nsystem is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA because the cost of administration is an\n\n“expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee,”3 which is an enumerated exception\n\nto the statutory definition of “expenditure.” Second, administration of the system is not a\n\n“contribution” as defined by the MCFA because there is no net conveyance of anything\n\nof monetary value made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. Last, a public\n\nschool’s administration of a payroll deduction system does not “provide volunteer\n\npersonal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section\n\n4(3)(a)”4 as defined by the MCFA because the MEA-PAC fully anticipates prepayment\n\n\n\n1\n    MCL 169.201 et seq.\n2\n    MCL 169.257(1).\n3\n    MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n4\n    MCL 169.257(1).\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\ffor any administration costs. Thus, the administration of a payroll deduction system by a\n\npublic school is permitted under the MCFA.\n\n                           I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n      Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary,\n\nincorporated labor organization that represents members employed by public schools,\n\ncolleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA’s political action committee,\n\nMEA-PAC, is a separate segregated fund under § 55 of the MCFA. MCL 169.255.\n\nAccording to the MEA, the MEA-PAC is funded in part by MEA member payroll\n\ndeductions. The MEA (or its affiliates) has entered into collective bargaining agreements\n\nwith various public school districts throughout the state that require the school district\n\nemployer to administer a payroll deduction plan for contributions to the MEA-PAC. The\n\ncurrent case involves such an agreement between the Kalamazoo County Education\n\nAssociation/Gull Lake Education Association and the Gull Lake Public Schools. The\n\nGull Lake collective bargaining agreement also requires the Gull Lake Public Schools to\n\nmake other payroll deductions, such as the payment of MEA dues and service fees. The\n\nMEA plans to pay the Gull Lake Public Schools, in advance, for all anticipated costs to\n\nGull Lake Public Schools attributable to administering payroll deductions to the MEA-\n\nPAC or any other separate segregated fund affiliated with the MEA. The MEA contends\n\nthat under this proposal, Gull Lake Public Schools would not incur any costs or expenses\n\nin administering the requested deductions because the Gull Lake Public Schools would be\n\npaid in advance for such costs and expenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       As a condition to implementing the collective bargaining agreement, a\n\nrepresentative of the Gull Lake Public Schools requested that the MEA obtain a\n\ndeclaratory ruling on the validity of the payroll deduction system. On August 22, 2006,\n\nthe MEA filed a request for a declaratory ruling with respondent, the Secretary of State.\n\nThe MEA detailed its proposal for payroll deductions to be made by the Gull Lake Public\n\nSchools and asserted that the administration of the payroll deductions by the school\n\ndistrict would not be an “expenditure” under the MCFA and would not violate § 57 of the\n\nMCFA, MCL 169.257. The MEA requested that the Gull Lake Public Schools be\n\nallowed to make and transmit payroll deductions requested by MEA members to MEA-\n\nPAC as long as the members had filled out voluntary consent forms and either the MEA\n\nor the MEA-PAC had paid the school district, in advance, for any costs associated with\n\nadministering those payroll deductions. The MEA also asked the Secretary of State for a\n\ndeclaratory ruling on what costs it should consider in determining the costs attributable to\n\nadministering the payroll deductions that are to be transmitted to the MEA-PAC.\n\n       On November 20, 2006, the Secretary of State ruled that the Gull Lake Public\n\nSchools could not make and transmit payroll deductions requested by MEA members to\n\nthe MEA-PAC because § 57 of the MCFA prohibits a public body from making\n\nexpenditures or collecting contributions for a political action committee. The ruling\n\nnoted that the Department of State and the Attorney General had both previously\n\nconcluded that a public body is prohibited from collecting and remitting contributions to\n\na committee through its administration of a payroll deduction plan. The ruling explained\n\nthat § 55 of the MCFA allows named private entities to make expenditures for the\n\nestablishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\n\n                                             4\n\ffund. However, the ruling stated that no explicit provision in the MCFA authorizes a\n\npublic body to do so and concluded that the school district is prohibited from expending\n\ngovernmental resources for a payroll deduction plan that deducts wages from its\n\nemployees on behalf of the MEA-PAC.\n\n         The Secretary of State’s ruling further concluded that paying the costs of\n\nadministering the payroll deductions in advance would not effectively avoid a violation\n\nof § 57. This conclusion was based on an analysis of this issue in a recent opinion of the\n\nAttorney General. OAG, 2005-2006, No 7187, p 81 (February 16, 2006). Because the\n\nSecretary of State concluded that administration of a payroll deduction system would\n\nviolate the MCFA, the ruling did not address what costs should be considered attributable\n\nto administering the payroll deductions or the dollar amount that should be prepaid.\n\n         The MEA petitioned for review of the declaratory ruling in the Ingham Circuit\n\nCourt.     On September 4, 2007, the trial court issued an opinion setting aside the\n\ndeclaratory ruling on the grounds that it was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. The trial court opined that if the costs of administration are paid in advance,\n\nadministration of payroll deductions does not result in transfer of money to a union’s\n\npolitical action committee and, therefore, an “expenditure” has not been made within the\n\nmeaning of the MCFA. Thus, the trial court held that a public body may administer\n\npayroll deductions as long as all the costs of making deductions are paid in advance.\n\n         The Secretary of State applied for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, which\n\nwas granted. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s opinion\n\nand held that, regardless of advance payment for the associated costs, a public school’s\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system is still an “expenditure” under the MCFA\n\n\n                                             5\n\fand thus prohibited.5       Judge WHITBECK dissented, and would have held that\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system is not an “expenditure”6 as the MCFA\n\ndefines it.\n\n         The MEA sought leave to appeal in this Court. This Court granted oral argument\n\non whether to grant the application7 and subsequently granted leave to appeal.8\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 280 Mich App 477, 486-487; 761 NW2d 234\n(2008).\n6\n    Id. at 490.\n7\n Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 483 Mich 1001 (2009). The Court directed the\nparties to brief\n\n         (1) whether a school district’s use of government resources for a payroll\n         deduction plan for contributions made by members of the . . . Michigan\n         Education Association (MEA) to MEA’s political action committee is\n         either an “expenditure” or a “contribution” under § 6 of the Michigan\n         Campaign Finance Act (MCFA), MCL 169.206; (2) whether § 57(1) of the\n         MCFA, MCL 169.257(1), prohibits a school district from expending\n         government resources for such a payroll deduction plan if the costs of the\n         plan are prepaid by the MEA; and (3) whether a school district has the\n         authority to collect and deliver payroll deductions for such contributions.\n         [Id.]\n8\n  Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 486 Mich 952 (2010). In the order granting leave to\nappeal, this Court asked the parties to include among the issues to be briefed the effect, if\nany, of Citizens United v Fed Election Comm, 558 US__; 130 S Ct 876; 175 L Ed 2d 753\n(2010), on this case. We note that because the issues presented in this case can be\nresolved under Michigan law, we do not opine on the application of United States\nSupreme Court caselaw.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n          The issue in this case is whether § 57 of the MCFA, MCL 169.257(1), prohibits a\n\npublic school from administering a payroll deduction system that remits funds to the\n\nMEA-PAC. This is an issue of statutory construction, which we review de novo.9\n\n          To interpret the MCFA, we apply the established rules of statutory construction.\n\n“Assuming that the Legislature has acted within its constitutional authority, the purpose\n\nof statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.”10\n\nAccordingly, a Court must interpret the language of a statute in a manner that is\n\nconsistent with the legislative intent.11 In determining the legislative intent, the actual\n\nlanguage of the statute must first be examined.12 “As far as possible, effect should be\n\ngiven to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute.”13 When considering the correct\n\ninterpretation, a statute must be read as a whole.14 Individual words and phrases, while\n\nimportant, should be read in the context of the entire legislative scheme.15 In defining\n\nparticular words within a statute, a court “must ‘consider both the plain meaning of the\n\n9\n In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing, 463 Mich 378, 383; 617\nNW2d 310 (2000).\n10\n  Potter v McLeary, 484 Mich 397, 410; 774 NW2d 1 (2009), citing Sun Valley Foods\nCo v Ward, 460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999).\n11\n     Potter, 484 Mich at 411.\n12\n     Id. at 410.\n13\n     Sun Valley, 460 Mich at 237.\n14\n     See id.\n15\n     Herman v Berrien Co, 481 Mich 352, 366; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fcritical word or phrase as well as “its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.”’”16\n\nWhen a statute explicitly defines a term, the statutory definition controls.17\n\n         In applying these established rules of statutory construction, we start our analysis\n\nwith a review of the relevant statutory language.        Section 57 of the MCFA, MCL\n\n169.257(1), prohibits public bodies from using public resources to make expenditures,\n\ncontributions, or provide volunteer services that are excluded from the definition of\n\n“contribution” under § 4(3)(a) of that act, MCL 169.204(3)(a). The statute provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n                A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n         or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n         software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n         other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide\n         volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of\n         contribution under section 4(3)(a). [MCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n         Thus, § 57 specifically prohibits a public body from using, or authorizing the use\n\nof, public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a contribution,\n\nor (3) provide volunteer services that are excluded from the definition of “contribution”\n\nunder § 4(3)(a). The plain language of the statute does not prohibit any other activity.\n\nTherefore, if the administration of the payroll deduction system is not tantamount to\n\ndoing one of these three things, the administration of the system is permissible under\n\nMichigan law.\n\n\n16\n  Id., quoting Sun Valley, 460 Mich at 237, quoting Bailey v United States, 516 US 137,\n145; 116 S Ct 501; 133 L Ed 2d 472 (1995).\n17\n     Tryc v Michigan Veterans’ Facility, 451 Mich 129, 136; 545 NW2d 642 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f                                    A. EXPENDITURE\n\n       We first examine whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem that remits funds to the MEA-PAC is an impermissible expenditure under § 57.\n\n“Expenditure” is specifically defined by the MCFA, so this definition controls for\n\npurposes of applying § 57. The general definition of “expenditure” under the MCFA is\n\nset forth in § 6, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n               (1) “Expenditure” means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of\n       payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods,\n       materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n       nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or\n       defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any\n       of the following:\n\n             (a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n       monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n       candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n                                           * * *\n\n              (2) Expenditure does not include any of the following:\n\n              (a) An expenditure for communication by a person with the person’s\n       paid members or shareholders and those individuals who can be solicited\n       for contributions to a separate segregated fund under [MCL 169.255].\n                                           * * *\n\n               (c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n       solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n       committee. [MCL 169.206 (emphasis added).]\n\n       Thus, MCL 169.206(1) details the general definition of “expenditure,” which is\n\nexpansive. It includes a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or\n\nanything of ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in\n\nassistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate, or the\n\n\n                                              9\n\fqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The definition also includes a\n\ncontribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value for purposes of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate or the qualification, passage, or\n\ndefeat of a ballot question. However, despite its expansive scope, the statutory definition\n\nof “expenditure” contains explicit exceptions under MCL 169.206(2), outlining items that\n\ncannot be considered an expenditure under the MCFA even though they may qualify\n\nunder the expansive general definition outlined in MCL 169.206(1).\n\n         We now consider whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem is an “expenditure” as defined by the MCFA. The administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system does arguably provide services to the MEA and the MEA-PAC in\n\nfacilitating payroll deductions from members by providing personnel and computer\n\nservices. The system allows MEA members to authorize the school to automatically\n\ndeduct money from their paychecks and remit the funds to the MEA-PAC. The MEA-\n\nPAC is a separate segregated fund under MCL 169.255 because it has been established\n\nby the MEA, a labor organization, to make contributions to, and expenditures on behalf\n\nof, candidate committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n\npolitical committees, and independent committees.18 Thus, the payroll deduction system\n\n18\n     MCL 169.255(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n                A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint\n         stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization\n         formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make\n         an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n         contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n         A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n         making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n\n\n                                              10\n\fadministers member contributions to a separate segregated fund. Although this process\n\nfalls within the general definition of “expenditure” under MCL 169.206(1), the\n\nadministration of such a system is explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under\n\nMCL 169.206(2)(c). To reiterate, MCL 169.206(2)(c) excludes from the definition of\n\n“expenditure” any “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.”19 A public\n\nschool’s administration of a payroll deduction falls squarely within the statutory\n\nexception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member contributions to their separate\n\nsegregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore, the administration of the system is not an\n\n“expenditure” under the MCFA.\n\n         The Secretary of State argues that the statutory exception in MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nshould not be applied to public bodies because the Legislature intended to treat public\n\nbodies differently from private entities and political action committees under the MCFA.\n\nHowever, this argument disregards the plain language of the statute. MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nis contained within the definitional provisions of the MCFA and includes no language\n\nlimiting its application to sections of the MCFA that deal only with private entities and\n\npolitical action committees. MCL 169.201(2), on the other hand, explicitly mandates that\n\n“[e]xcept as otherwise defined in this act, the words and phrases defined in [MCL\n\n169.202 to 169.212] shall, for the purposes of this act, have the meanings ascribed to\n\n\n\n         committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n         political committees, and independent committees.\n19\n     MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fthem in those sections.” Thus, the statutory definition of “expenditure” controls and\n\napplies to the entire MCFA, including § 57, exceptions and all.\n\n           The Court of Appeals clearly erred by holding that a public school’s\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system is an expenditure. Without providing any\n\nindependent statutory analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that the administration of\n\nthe system is an expenditure by relying solely on the Secretary of State’s prior\n\ninterpretation of the term. The Court of Appeals reasoned:\n\n                  The Secretary previously issued an interpretive statement indicating\n           that “the department interprets the term ‘expenditure’ to include the costs\n           associated with collecting and delivering contributions to a committee” and\n           that “[a] payroll deduction system is one method of collecting and\n           delivering contributions.” Interpretative Statement to Mr. Robert LaBrant\n           (November 14, 2005).[20]\n\nWithout any independent statutory analysis, the Court of Appeals then concluded: “We\n\nfind nothing in the plain language of the MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates\n\nsomething that otherwise constitutes an expenditure.”21\n\n           The Court of Appeals erred by considering whether a supposedly illegal\n\nexpenditure could be cured without first analyzing whether the Secretary of State’s\n\ninterpretation of the term “expenditure” comported with the statute. The Secretary of\n\nState’s interpretation of the MCFA is not binding on the judiciary, and the Court of\n\nAppeals should have independently considered whether the administration of a payroll\n\n\n\n20\n     Mich Ed Ass’n, 280 Mich App at 486.\n21\n     Id.\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                                          22\ndeduction system is an “expenditure.”           Most importantly, the Secretary of State’s\n\ninterpretation of “expenditure” is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the relevant\n\nstatutory language. The Secretary of State’s interpretation of “expenditure” includes\n\ncosts associated with collecting and delivering contributions to a committee. But, as\n\npreviously explained, the statutory definition of “expenditure” explicitly excludes these\n\ncosts.    As a result, the Court of Appeals clearly erred by adopting respondent’s\n\ninterpretation of “expenditure.”    The plain language of the statute dictates that the\n\nadministration costs at issue are excluded from the statutory term “expenditure.”\n\n         Administration of a payroll deduction system is an “expenditure for the\n\nestablishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\nfund or independent committee,” and thus is an enumerated exception to the statutory\n\ndefinition of “expenditure.”    Therefore, the administration of the payroll deduction\n\nsystem is not an “expenditure” as defined by the MCFA and is not prohibited by § 57 on\n\nthat ground.\n\n                                   B. CONTRIBUTION\n\n         We next examine whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem is an impermissible “contribution” under the MCFA.23           “Contribution,” like\n\n\n\n22\n  This Court is not bound by the Secretary of State’s interpretations of the law or by\nAttorney General opinions. See Traverse City Sch Dist v Attorney General, 384 Mich\n390, 412; 185 NW2d 9 (1971).\n23\n   Although the Court of Appeals did not consider whether administration of the payroll\ndeduction system is a contribution, we nevertheless discuss the issue because it is another\nstatutory basis for an argument that the administration of a payroll deduction system\n\n\n                                               13\n\f“expenditure,” is specifically defined by the MCFA, and this definition controls for\n\npurposes of application to § 57. The definition of “contribution” under the MCFA is set\n\nforth in MCL 169.204, which provides:\n\n              (1) “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n      expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n      loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n      a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made\n      for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or\n      for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n             (2) Contribution includes the full purchase price of tickets or\n      payment of an attendance fee for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies,\n      testimonials, and other fund-raising events; an individual’s own money or\n      property other than the individual’s homestead used on behalf of that\n      individual’s candidacy; the granting of discounts or rebates not available to\n      the general public; or the granting of discounts or rebates by broadcast\n      media and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for\n      the same office; and the endorsing or guaranteeing of a loan for the amount\n      the endorser or guarantor is liable.\n\n             (3) Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n             (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n      payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n      individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n      without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n      indirectly, repaid.\n\n            (b) Food and beverages, not to exceed $100.00 in value during a\n      calendar year, which are donated by an individual and for which\n      reimbursement is not given.\n\n            (c) An offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and\n      unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within\n      30 business days after receipt. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\nmight be impermissible and the litigants have briefed and argued the issue before this\nCourt.\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f         The statutory definition of “contribution” includes the term “expenditure.”\n\nBecause “expenditure” is explicitly defined by the MCFA, the statutory definition\n\ncontrols.24 We have already explained why the administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA and thus cannot be a contribution on that\n\nbasis. The only other way that the administration of the system could be a “contribution”\n\nunder the MCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a “transfer of anything\n\nof ascertainable monetary value . . . made for the purpose of influencing the nomination\n\nor election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n         The Secretary of State argues that the actual and intangible costs associated with\n\nthe administration of a payroll deduction system constitute a contribution because there is\n\na transfer of something of ascertainable monetary value from the school district to the\n\nMEA-PAC and the transfer, although made pursuant to a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, is made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The Secretary\n\nof State asserts that the labor and computer resources that are expended to administer the\n\npayroll deduction system have an ascertainable monetary value, and the fact that they are\n\nexpended for the benefit of the MEA-PAC conveys value to the MEA-PAC.                      The\n\nSecretary of State further argues that prepayment for the services does not negate the\n\ntransfer because MEA-PAC still receives the benefit of the services.\n\n         We disagree with this interpretation of the word “transfer” in the statute. Because\n\n“transfer” is a nontechnical word that is not defined within the statute, we first look to the\n\n24\n     Tryc, 451 Mich at 136.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fplain meaning of the term to ascertain what the Legislature intended by using “transfer”\n\nto define a “contribution.”25 The first dictionary definition of “transfer” is “to convey or\n\nremove from one place, person, etc., to another.”26 In order for there to be a contribution,\n\n“anything of ascertainable monetary value” must be conveyed from one entity to another.\n\n         There are two competing ways in which to interpret the word “transfer” in the\n\nstatute. The first way to read the statute would require that any conveyance of value for\n\nservices provided to a campaign, regardless of whether the services are paid for, would\n\nconstitute a contribution.    The second way to read the statute would require a net\n\nconveyance of value in order to be a “transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue.”\n\n         We conclude that the statute must be read to require a net conveyance of monetary\n\nvalue, as opposed to a mere exchange of value.               Any other interpretation of\n\n“contribution” would lead to an absurd result, and statutes must be construed to prevent\n\nabsurd results.27 For example, if the statute were to be interpreted in the manner the\n\nSecretary of State suggests, then a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the\n\nnormal course of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because it has\n\ntransferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even though the shop has been\n\ncompensated for the cost of providing the signage.             Such an interpretation of\n\n\n25\n MCL 8.3a; Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs v Mich Prop & Cas Guaranty Ass’n, 456\nMich 590, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998).\n26\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n27\n     McAuley v Gen Motors Corp, 457 Mich 513, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f“contribution” would defy common sense, and we do not read the statute in this manner.\n\nInstead, we conclude that the statute requires a net conveyance of “anything of monetary\n\nvalue” in order for there to be a campaign contribution. If costs for administering the\n\npayroll deduction system are paid in advance, there is no net conveyance of anything of\n\nmonetary value, and there is no contribution.\n\n       Furthermore, our conclusion that a “contribution” under MCL 169.204(1) requires\n\na net transfer of value comports with the remainder of that section, which specifically\n\nexcludes from the statutory definition of “contribution” any “contribution if expressly and\n\nunconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business\n\ndays after receipt.” MCL 169.204(3)(c). In other words, if the contribution is rejected,\n\nreturned, or refunded, it is no longer a “contribution” under the MCFA. Moreover, MCL\n\n169.204(2) explains that a “contribution” includes “the granting of discounts or rebates\n\nnot available to the general public . . . .” This implies that when an entity provides\n\nproducts or services at full price, the entity is not making a contribution. Thus, the statute\n\nclearly requires that there be a net transfer of value in order for there to be a contribution\n\nunder the MCFA.\n\n       The MEA plans to prepay the school district for all ascertainable costs associated\n\nwith the administration of a payroll deduction system, and in fact asked the Secretary of\n\nState for a declaratory ruling regarding the costs to be prepaid. The administration of the\n\npayroll deduction system will not result in a net transfer of anything of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value as all costs will be ascertained and prepaid. Accordingly, there is no\n\ncontribution under the MCFA, and a public school’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system is not prohibited by § 57 on that ground.\n\n\n                                             17\n\f        Additionally, a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not\n\nan impermissible contribution under the MCFA because the system is not administered\n\n“for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the\n\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”28 When a public body administers\n\na payroll deduction plan, it does not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a\n\nballot question. Rather, administering the plan is one step removed: it merely allows\n\nsomeone else to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a political issue. The\n\npublic body administers the plan simply because it is required to do so as part of a labor\n\ncontract between the public body and its employees. Consequently, because a public\n\nschool’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not done for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing a political issue, the administration of the system is not a contribution under\n\nthe MCFA.29\n\n\n\n28\n     MCL 169.204(1).\n29\n   A public body has the authority to administer payroll deduction plans. The wages and\nfringe benefits act, MCL 408.477, provides that\n\n        [e]xcept for those deductions required or expressly permitted . . . by a\n        collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from the\n        wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an\n        employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established . . . under\n        [MCL 169.255] without the full, free and written consent of the\n        employee . . . .\nThus, under the plain language of MCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to\nadminister a payroll deduction plan that contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA\nenters into a collective bargaining agreement that expressly permits the deductions.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f                        C. VOLUNTEER PERSONAL SERVICES\n\n         Lastly, we examine whether a public school’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system impermissibly “provide[s] volunteer personal services that are excluded\n\nfrom the definition of contribution under section 4(3)(a)” of the MCFA. As noted above,\n\n§ 4(3) provides:\n\n               Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n                (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n         payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n         individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n         without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n         indirectly, repaid. [MCL 169.201(3).]\n\n         Although such services are thus not considered a contribution for purposes of the\n\nrest of the MCFA, § 57 specifically indicates that public bodies cannot use public\n\nresources to provide volunteer services that are not compensated.             However, the\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction system at issue does not involve volunteer\n\nservices by public employees because the MEA intends to prepay for all services\n\nrendered. Because volunteer services are not defined by the statute, we again look to the\n\nplain meaning of the terms to discern the legislative intent. Dictionary definitions of\n\n“volunteer” include “a person who performs a service willingly and without pay.”30\n\nWillingness to perform an activity is not enough to fall within the scope of this\n\nsubsection; the activity must also be performed without pay. In this case, the MEA fully\n\nanticipates payment and plans to prepay for any administration costs. As a result, a\n\n\n30\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fpublic school’s administration of a payroll deduction system does not “provide volunteer\n\npersonal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section\n\n4(3)(a)” of the MCFA and is not prohibited by § 57 on this final ground. Therefore, the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system by a public school is permitted under the\n\nMCFA.\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n         A public school may administer payroll deductions for its employees who remit\n\nfunds to the MEA-PAC, because MCL 169.257(1) only prohibits a public body from\n\nusing public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a\n\ncontribution, and (3) provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\ndefinition of “contribution” under MCL 169.204(3)(a). First, the administration of the\n\nsystem at issue is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA because the cost of\n\nadministration is an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,”31 which is an\n\nenumerated exception to the statutory definition of “expenditure.”                 Second,\n\nadministration of the system is not a “contribution” as defined by the MCFA because\n\nthere is no net conveyance of anything of monetary value made for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or\n\ndefeat of a ballot question. Last, a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem does not “provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\n\n31\n     MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fdefinition of contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)]” because the MEA-PAC fully\n\nanticipates prepayment for any administration costs. Thus, the administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system by a public school is permitted under the MCFA, and the Court of\n\nAppeals erred by concluding that it is not. We reverse the judgment of the Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n                                                       Diane M.

(dissenting).\n\n      The issue in this case concerns the Legislature’s mandated separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities. The Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA)\n\nprohibits a “public body” from using public resources to make any “contribution or\n\nexpenditure” for political purposes. MCL 169.257(1). The majority concludes that a\n\nschool district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to the\n\nMichigan Education Association’s Political Action Committee (MEA-PAC) “is not\n\nprecluded by any prohibition in MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.” Ante at 1.\n\nI respectfully dissent, and believe that a school district’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee (a) constitutes a\n\n“contribution” because public resources are being used to advance the political objectives\n\nof the committee and (b) constitutes an “expenditure” because public “services” and\n\n“facilities in assistance of” these same political objectives are being provided. Thus, the\n\n\n                                            1\n\fschool district’s payroll deduction plan is prohibited by § 57 of the MCFA, MCL\n\n169.257. This interpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but\n\nalso with the evident purpose of § 57, which is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n                                I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n\n       Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary,\n\nincorporated labor organization that represents approximately 136,000 members\n\nemployed by public schools, colleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA-\n\nPAC is a separate segregated political fund established by the MEA in accordance with\n\n§ 55 of MCFA, MCL 169.255.            The MEA-PAC is significantly funded by payroll\n\ndeductions of MEA members who have authorized the deductions. The purpose of the\n\nMEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in politics, by\n\nelecting candidates favored by the MEA and by furthering the enactment of MEA\n\nlegislative and executive policy initiatives.\n\n       As a public-employee labor organization, the MEA has entered into collective\n\nbargaining agreements with various public school districts across the state. Some number\n\nof these agreements, including that between the MEA’s locally affiliated Kalamazoo\n\nCounty/Gull Lake Education Associations and the Gull Lake Community Schools (the\n\nschool district), require that a school district administer a payroll deduction plan for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fcontributions of MEA members to the MEA-PAC. In return, the MEA pays the school\n\ndistrict the costs of the plan’s administration.\n\n       On August 22, 2006, the MEA filed a request for a declaratory ruling with\n\nrespondent, the Secretary of State, to determine whether the school district could continue\n\nto make and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC.1 Respondent ruled that,\n\nabsent express statutory authority, the school district is prohibited from expending public\n\nresources for a payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-PAC. The MEA appealed\n\nto the circuit court, which held that respondent’s ruling was “arbitrary, capricious and an\n\nabuse of discretion,” reasoning that, although the school district’s administration of the\n\nplan constitutes an “expenditure” under MCFA, when the costs of administering the plan\n\nhave been reimbursed, “no transfer of money to the MEA-PAC has occurred, and\n\ntherefore an ‘expenditure’ has not been made within the meaning of the MCFA.”\n\n       In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 57 of MCFA\n\nprohibits a “public body,” such as a school district, from using public resources “to make\n\na contribution or expenditure.” According to the Court, the costs associated with the plan\n\nconstitute an “expenditure,” and the reimbursement of such costs does not alter that\n\nconclusion. Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 280 Mich App 477, 486; 761 NW2d 234\n\n(2008). The MEA then sought leave to appeal in this Court. On November 5, 2009, we\n\n\n\n\n1\n The Secretary of State is authorized to issue declaratory rulings to implement the\nMichigan Campaign Finance Act, MCL 169.201 et seq., in accordance with the\nAdministrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fheard oral arguments on the application, and nearly seven months later we granted the\n\nMEA’s application for leave to appeal.2\n\n                                II.

Furthermore, Const 1963, art 2, § 4\n\nrequires the Legislature to preserve the integrity of elections, providing in pertinent part:\n\n                The legislature shall enact laws to preserve the purity of elections, to\n         preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective\n         franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee\n         voting.\n\nCharged to preserve the “purity of elections” and to “guard against abuses of the elective\n\nfranchise,” the Legislature enacted MCL 169.257, commonly referred to as § 57 of\n\nMCFA. Section 57 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to “make a\n\n2\n    See the discussion in part VI of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fcontribution or expenditure” for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of\n\na candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The clear\n\npurpose of § 57, as reflected in its language, is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities.3\n\n                                       IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       MCL 169.257(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n       or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n       software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n       other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide\n       volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of\n       contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)].\nThere is no question that a school district constitutes a “public body” within the meaning\n\nof § 57.4 Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether a school district’s administration\n\nof a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to a political action committee constitutes a\n\n\n3\n  See also, e.g., the political activities by public employees act, MCL 15.401 et seq.\n(providing that an employee of the state or local unit of government may not engage in\npolitical affairs during working hours); the Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act,\nMCL 432.201 et seq. (providing that members, employees, or agents of the Michigan\nGaming Control Board may not engage in political activity for the duration of their\nemployment); and Civil Service Rule 1-12.6 (prohibiting state employees from\nparticipating in political activities during working hours).\n4\n   MCFA defines a “public body” to include “[a] county, city, township, village,\nintercounty, intercity, or regional governing body; a council, school district, special\ndistrict, or municipal corporation; or a board, department, commission, or council or an\nagency of a board, department, commissioner, or council.” MCL 169.211(6)(c).\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f“contribution or expenditure” within the meaning of the same provision. If the plan does,\n\nit is expressly prohibited.\n\n                                 A. “CONTRIBUTION”\n\n       MCL 169.204(1) defines a “contribution” as follows:\n              “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n       expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n       loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n       a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for\n       the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for\n       the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[5]\nAn “in-kind contribution” is defined as a “contribution . . . other than money.” MCL\n\n169.209(3).\n\n       The school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan that facilitates\n\npayments to the MEA-PAC constitutes a prohibited “contribution.” First, the school\n\ndistrict uses a variety of public resources to administer the plan. For example, the school\n\ndistrict must use its paper, pens, and copiers to develop and execute payroll deduction\n\nauthorization forms; school personnel must collect, enter, and monitor the data of\n\nparticipating MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must\n\nbe specifically configured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-\n\nPAC; school personnel must then be prepared to respond to individual teachers who find\n\nit necessary from time to time to adjust or correct or withdraw their own deduction\n\nauthorizations; and this process must necessarily involve the use of public office space,\n\nequipment, and employee time.\n\n5\n  The MEA-PAC is a “person” because, as a separate segregated fund, it functions as the\nresult of an organization or group of persons acting jointly. See MCL 169.211(1).\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       Second, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\nconstitutes something of “ascertainable monetary value” because there is inherent value\n\nto the MEA-PAC in having payroll deductions automatically taken from members’ wages\n\nas opposed to requiring individual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. That there is such\n\n“ascertainable monetary value” is self-evident from the very fact that the MEA-PAC has\n\naffirmatively sought out the assistance of the school district and has litigated to the\n\nhighest court of this state an appeal asserting its right to enter into the instant agreement\n\nwith the school district. Parties do not typically enter into contracts absent a belief that\n\nthe rights or benefits accorded them under the contract have some “ascertainable\n\nmonetary value,” and the instant contract seems no different. Such value can almost\n\ncertainly be identified as the sum of (a) the additional contributions resulting from the\n\nease of the payroll deduction process compared to a political contribution process in\n\nwhich individual solicitations must be undertaken and (b) the reduced administrative and\n\ntransactional costs of the former process compared to the latter process. The MEA\n\nobviously prefers the payroll deduction process because it is a more efficient, and a more\n\nproductive, process by which to secure funding for its political activities. The school\n\ndistrict is not incidental to this process, but constitutes an indispensable element.\n\nWithout the school district’s contracted-for services, some lesser amount of contributions\n\nwould presumably be raised on behalf of the MEA-PAC, and at a greater cost.\n\n       Third, the services undertaken on behalf of the MEA-PAC are “made for the\n\npurpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification,\n\npassage, or defeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.204(1), because, as discussed earlier,\n\nthe purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA\n\n\n                                             7\n\fin partisan politics.6 Thus, the school district’s administration of the deduction plan\n\nconstitutes a “contribution,” as that term is defined by MCL 169.204(1).7 Because the\n\nschool district employs public resources to make this “contribution,” its administration of\n\nthe deduction plan is a straightforward violation of § 57 of MCFA.\n\n       Moreover, the administration of the payroll deduction plan also constitutes an “in-\n\nkind contribution,” defined by MCL 169.209(3), as a “contribution . . . other than\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The majority states that “[w]hen a public body administers a payroll deduction plan, it\ndoes not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot question.” Ante at 17.\nHowever, the majority fails to recognize that MCL 169.204(1) defines “contribution” as\n“a payment . . . made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\ncandidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Therefore, the pertinent question is not whether the “public body” itself is\nattempting to influence a political race or ballot question, but whether the payments that\nresult from its administration of the payroll deduction plan are intended for that purpose.\nIt is obvious here that the “payment[s] [are] made for the purpose of influencing the\nnomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a\nballot question.” This is the purpose that individual MEA members have in mind when\nthey authorize payments, and it is the purpose that the MEA-PAC has in mind when it\nreceives payments from the school district. It is equally obvious that the school district\nitself must be fully cognizant of this purpose both when it receives payments from\nindividual MEA members and when it delivers payments to the MEA-PAC. The fact that\nthe school district itself might not care whether such payments will influence a political\nrace or ballot question does not alter that the purpose of these payments is to do precisely\nthat.\n7\n The majority further errs in its analysis when it concludes that administration of the plan\n“merely allows someone else to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a\npolitical issue,” ante at 17 (emphasis in original), i.e., the MEA member who has\nauthorized the payroll deduction. Instead, the school district itself makes both a\n“contribution,” and an “in-kind contribution,” by providing valuable services to the\nMEA-PAC in aid and furtherance of its political activities. That is, quite independently\nof the contributions of individual MEA members, the school district contributes\nsomething of further “ascertainable monetary value” to the MEA-PAC.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fmoney.”8 Although it is clearly possible to quantify the time spent by employees and the\n\nresources expended by the school district in administering the deduction plan, and\n\nthereby to ascertain the cost of such a “contribution” to the school district itself, it is\n\nconsiderably more difficult to quantify the intangible benefits that the MEA receives\n\nfrom the deduction plan. Moreover, it is quite certain that these benefits substantially\n\noutweigh the costs to the school district, and therefore cannot be calculated simply by\n\nreference to the school district’s costs. The most significant of these is simply the extent\n\nof access to a district’s MEA membership that is afforded to the MEA-PAC by the\n\ndeduction plan. Such access avoids any need on the part of the MEA-PAC to establish its\n\nown administrative apparatus for political fundraising, vitiates its need to engage in\n\ncostly mailings and alternative forms of communications with its members, and dispenses\n\nwith its burden of having to process checks, money orders, or credit cards from\n\ncontributors, as would have been necessary for any other solicitor of political\n\ncontributions. As MEA’s counsel at oral argument acknowledged, this method has\n\nproved an “effective” means to raise money.             Almost certainly, the marginal\n\nadministrative costs of the payroll deduction plan to the school district, which already\n\nmay have in place a mechanism by which taxes and charitable contributions can be\n\n\n\n8\n  Respondent and the amici curiae supporting her devoted a significant portion of their\nbriefs and time at oral arguments to explaining how the school district’s administration of\nthe deduction plan amounts to an “in-kind contribution,” and yet the majority fails to\neven address this argument. Although the majority provides no explanation or\njustification for this omission, I am nonetheless sympathetic to its plight. It is just too\ndifficult sometimes to argue that an animal that looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and\nsquawks like a duck is not a “duck.”\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fdeducted from employees’ paychecks, will be less than the marginal administrative costs\n\nof an equivalent plan to the MEA, which does not have a similar mechanism in place.\n\nThe difference between these respective administrative costs can fairly be described as an\n\n“in-kind contribution” by the school district to the MEA-PAC, however difficult it may\n\nbe to quantify in dollars. It is a “contribution . . . other than money” that is made for the\n\n“purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification,\n\npassage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n                                  B. “EXPENDITURE”\n\n       Section 57 of MCFA also prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to\n\nmake an “expenditure.” An “expenditure” is defined as\n\n       a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of\n       ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in\n       assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate,\n       or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. [MCL\n       169.206(1).]\nThe school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-\n\nPAC constitutes a prohibited “expenditure” because the school district directly provides\n\n“services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC. The school district provides\n\n“services” to the MEA-PAC in its administration of the deduction plan by developing and\n\nexecuting payroll deduction authorization forms; by collecting, entering, and monitoring\n\nthe data of MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must be\n\nconfigured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; and by\n\naccommodating individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to adjust or\n\ncorrect or withdraw their deduction authorizations. Further, the school district provides\n\n“facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC through the use of public office space and\n\n\n                                             10\n\fequipment. These “services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC are, once\n\nagain, made for the purpose of “the nomination or election of a candidate, or the\n\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.206(1)(a), because, as\n\ndiscussed previously, the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the\n\ninvolvement of the MEA in politics, by electing candidates favored by the MEA and by\n\nenacting MEA legislative and policy initiatives. Thus, the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan constitutes an “expenditure” as that term is defined by MCL\n\n169.206(1)(a) and is specifically prohibited.\n\n       The majority concedes that the school district’s administration of the deduction\n\nplan “falls within the general definition of ‘expenditure’ under MCL 169.206(1) . . . .”\n\nAnte at 10. However, the majority holds that the plan also falls within a specific statutory\n\nexclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.” See ante at 10. This exception\n\nprovides that an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n expenditure for the establishment,\n\nadministration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or\n\nindependent committee.” MCL 169.206(2)(c). According to the majority, a school\n\ndistrict’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits payments to a political\n\naction committee constitutes an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee” and\n\nis, therefore, allowed under § 57. Ante at 13. However, the majority overlooks that a\n\n“public body,” such as a school district, is not authorized to “establish” a separate\n\nsegregated fund under MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion.\n\n       Instead, this exclusion is clearly designed to apply only to corporations and labor\n\norganizations that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate\n\n\n                                            11\n\fsegregated funds in the first place. This interpretation, limiting the § 6(2)(c) exclusion to\n\ncorporations and labor organizations, is a necessary implication from the structure of\n\nMCFA for three reasons. First, § 54 of MCFA, MCL 169.254, imposes the same rule,\n\nprohibiting the making of a “contribution or expenditure,” on corporations and labor\n\norganizations that § 57 imposes on public bodies. In pertinent part, § 54 provides:\n\n             Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in . . . section\n       55 [MCL 169.255]. . . a corporation, joint stock company, domestic\n       dependent sovereign, or labor organization shall not make a contribution or\n       expenditure . . . . [MCL 169.254(1) (emphasis added).]\n       Second, unlike § 57, § 54 does not constitute an absolute prohibition against\n\nmaking a “contribution or expenditure;” rather, pursuant to § 55,\n\n       [a] corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint stock\n       company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed\n       under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make an\n       expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n       A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n       making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n       committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n       political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]\n       Third, there is no similar counterpart in § 57 that allows a “public body” to make\n\n“an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions\n\nto a separate segregated fund . . . .” Thus, under § 55, the only entities allowed to\n\nestablish a separate segregated fund are corporations, joint stock companies, domestic\n\ndependent sovereigns, or labor organizations, such as the MEA. Considered together,\n\n§ 55 and the § 6(2)(c) exclusion that permits an “expenditure for the establishment,\n\nadministration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund” provide a\n\nlimited mechanism allowing entities such as the MEA to create, establish, administer, or\n\n\n                                             12\n\ffund a separate segregated fund for purposes that would otherwise be disallowed by § 54.\n\nIn contrast, a “public body,” such as a school district, is not entitled to create, establish,\n\nadminister, or fund a separate segregated fund, under § 55 or any other provision, and\n\nthus may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.”\n\n       Even if, as the majority claims, the § 6(2)(c) exclusion is not limited to § 55\n\nentities, the majority’s application of the exclusion remains utterly illogical.         The\n\nmajority concludes that although a school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan constitutes an “expenditure,” it is nevertheless\n\n       explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL\n       169.206(2)(c) . . . [, which] excludes from the definition of “expenditure”\n       any “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.” A\n       public school’s administration of a payroll deduction falls squarely within\n       the statutory exception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member\n       contributions to their separate segregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore,\n       the administration of the system is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA.\n\n                                           * * *\n\n              Most importantly, the Secretary of State’s interpretation of\n       “expenditure” is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the relevant\n       statutory language. The Secretary of State’s interpretation of “expenditure”\n       includes costs associated with collecting and delivering contributions to a\n       committee. But . . . the statutory definition of “expenditure” explicitly\n       excludes these costs. . . . The plain language of the statute dictates that the\n       administration costs at issue are excluded from the statutory term\n       “expenditure.” [Ante at 10, 12 (emphasis omitted).]\nThe majority thus concludes that the administration of a payroll deduction plan falls\n\n“squarely within the statutory exception.” Under MCL 169.206(2)(c), an “expenditure”\n\ndoes not encompass what would otherwise be an “expenditure” for (a) establishment of a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee, (b) administration of a separate\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fsegregated fund or independent committee, or (c) solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee. Thus, in order to fall within the\n\npurview of this exception, a “public body” must be engaged in one of these enumerated\n\nactivities. In this case, however, the school district is engaged in none.\n\n       First, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the establishment of a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee because the separate segregated fund,\n\nthe MEA-PAC, has already been established by the MEA. In any event, the school\n\ndistrict could not establish a separate segregated fund in the first place, because that\n\nauthority is limited to the entities enumerated in § 55 (corporations, joint stock\n\ncompanies, domestic dependent sovereigns, and labor organizations).\n\n       Second, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the administration\n\nof a separate segregated fund or independent committee because the school district is not\n\n“administering” the MEA-PAC; rather, the school district is simply administering the\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to the MEA-PAC. That is, the school district\n\nmakes no determinations at all concerning amounts of funds to be raised from MEA\n\nmembers or other funding sources; the nature and substance of communications to MEA\n\nmembers and other funding sources about the need and urgency of such contributions; the\n\nidentification of political candidates and causes as beneficiaries of the MEA-PAC, and in\n\nwhat amounts; or strategies for optimizing the impact of MEA-PAC participation in\n\npolitical campaigns and causes. The majority, however, holds that “[t]he plain language\n\nof the statute dictates that the administration costs at issue are excluded from the statutory\n\nterm ‘expenditure.’” Ante at 12. In so asserting, the majority misinterprets the statute,\n\nbecause the only administrative costs that are excluded under this exclusion are those\n\n\n                                             14\n\fassociated with administering a “separate segregated fund or independent committee.”\n\nMCL 169.206(2)(c).      That the school district is administering a process by which\n\npayments are remitted to such a fund is hardly the equivalent of administering the fund\n\nitself, such that the § 6(2)(c) exclusion would apply. The majority is badly confused in\n\nthis regard.\n\n       Third, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee; rather, the school\n\ndistrict is using public resources for processing payments to the MEA-PAC.               As\n\ndiscussed earlier, the school district’s “expenditure” consists of the use of personnel,\n\noffice space, computers, software, and other public resources to remit payments to the\n\nMEA-PAC. The school district is not, for example, maintaining an advertising campaign\n\non behalf of the MEA-PAC, cold-calling MEA members, or preparing mailers or\n\nbrochures to enlist contributors. As such, the school district’s use of public resources for\n\nprocessing payments to the MEA-PAC cannot be viewed as soliciting contributions, but\n\nonly as facilitating such contributions, an entirely distinct concept.      It follows that\n\nbecause the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not fall\n\nwithin any of the three enumerated exclusions set forth in MCL 169.206(2)(c), it is not\n\nexcluded from the definition of an “expenditure.”9\n\n\n\n9\n  Even assuming arguendo that the school district’s administration of the payroll\ndeduction plan constitutes “an expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,”\nwhich we believe it plainly does not, by its terms, the exclusion only applies to\n“expenditure,” and not to “contribution.”\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                     C. RELEVANCE OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS\n\n       Having determined that the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan that remits payments to the MEA-PAC constitutes both a “contribution”\n\nand an “expenditure,” the question remains whether the MEA’s preparedness to pay in\n\nadvance the school district’s costs associated with the plan remedies what would\n\notherwise constitute a violation of § 57. I do not believe that it does.\n\n       The Court of Appeals, in my judgment, correctly held that there is “nothing in the\n\nplain language of the MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates something that\n\notherwise constitutes an expenditure.” Mich Ed Ass’n, 280 Mich App at 486. A court’s\n\nprimary purpose in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\n\nFrankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, 456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611\n\n(1998).   “Courts may not speculate regarding legislative intent beyond the words\n\nexpressed in a statute. Hence, nothing may be read into a statute that is not within the\n\nmanifest intent of the Legislature as derived from the act itself.” Omne Fin, Inc v Shacks,\n\nInc, 460 Mich 305, 311; 596 NW2d 591 (1999) (citations omitted). The Legislature\n\ndeclined to provide that advance payments remedy what would otherwise constitute a\n\nviolation of § 57.\n\n       The suggestion that advance payments remedy a violation of § 57 is belied by the\n\nterms of the statute. Section 57 provides that “[a] public body . . . shall not use or\n\nauthorize the use” of public resources to make a “contribution or expenditure . . . .”\n\nMCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added). The use of “shall” in a statute generally “indicates a\n\nmandatory and imperative directive.” Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, 471 Mich 745,\n\n752; 691 NW2d 424 (2005) (citations omitted). As such, the statute mandates that the\n\n\n                                             16\n\fschool district not “use or authorize the use of” its public resources to make a\n\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” Nothing in MCFA leads to the conclusion that the\n\nLegislature intended § 57 to be interpreted any differently. Irrespective of whether the\n\nschool district is reimbursed for its administration of the payroll deduction plan, the\n\nschool district nonetheless has employed public resources to make a “contribution or\n\nexpenditure” for political purposes.10 The advance payment of expenses simply does not\n\nnegate what § 57 is intended to prohibit. That is, the gravamen of § 57 is not that a\n\n“public body,” whose resources have been employed for private political purposes be\n\ncompensated on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but that public resources not be used for such\n\npurposes in the first place. That the costs of dismantling the wall separating government\n\nand partisan political campaigning are to be paid by those who desire to use taxpayer\n\nresources for their own campaigning is not the point of § 57; rather, it is that the wall not\n\nbe dismantled.11\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Moreover, the advance payment of the school district’s expenses in administering the\ndeduction plan does not avoid the question of the extent to which an exchange of\nsomething of “ascertainable monetary value” has taken place. Where the school district\nhas provided a service “at cost” to the MEA-PAC, even though the “ascertainable\nmonetary value” of that service to the MEA-PAC exceeds that cost, as it almost always\nwill in an economy in which service providers typically seek to profit from their services,\nfurther inquiry would be necessary concerning the specific terms of the school district-\npolitical action committee transaction, even if such a transaction were permissible in the\nfirst place under § 57.\n11\n  If the MEA-PAC is allowed to commandeer the resources of a “public body” simply by\nreimbursing its costs, there is nothing that would prevent the political action committee of\nany corporation from demanding or receiving the same treatment.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f        Furthermore, the unquantifiable cost to the school district, as well as to taxpayers,\n\nparents, and students, of having time and resources diverted from the school district’s\n\nprimary responsibilities of administering schools and educating students in order to\n\nadminister a process of raising political contributions for the MEA-PAC cannot simply be\n\npaid in advance or reimbursed. Time is a zero-sum resource, and it is irretrievably lost to\n\ntaxpayers, parents, and students when it is taken away from the former responsibilities\n\nand redirected to the latter responsibilities. If some lesser portion of each day is devoted\n\nto the interests of the school district and a greater portion of each day is devoted to the\n\npartisan political interests of a labor organization, taxpayers, parents, and students suffer.\n\nAlthough advance payment may recompense the school district its employees’ salaries\n\nfor the time spent on administration of the plan and for the use of supplies and other\n\npublic resources, monetary reimbursement, paid in advance or otherwise, is simply\n\ninsufficient to recover the time that is diverted from the primary obligations of the school\n\ndistrict.\n\n        Moreover, because neither advance payments nor reimbursements prevent the\n\nprohibited “use” of public resources from occurring in the first place, the act is\n\npunishable as a misdemeanor and subject to a fine that may be “equal to the amount of\n\nthe improper contribution or expenditure.” MCL 169.257(2)(b). The fact that one of the\n\npenalties for making an improper “contribution or expenditure” requires the violator to\n\npay an amount that is “equal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure”\n\nindicates strongly that such a payment, whether in the form of a “penalty” or a\n\n“reimbursement,” does not transform an improper “contribution or expenditure” into a\n\nproper one. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, the misdemeanor statute would\n\n\n                                             18\n\fmore likely have read that the criminal sanction to be paid is “equal to the amount of the\n\nimproper contribution or expenditure, less any reimbursement of such contribution or\n\nexpenditure.”12\n\n                                V. RESPONSE TO MAJORITY\n\n       As discussed previously, I believe that the majority errs by holding that a school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is excluded from the definition of\n\nan “expenditure” under MCL 169.206(2)(c) because a “public body,” such as a school\n\ndistrict, is not authorized to create a separate segregated fund under MCFA and,\n\n\n12\n   The MEA also argues with regard to reimbursements that since the school district is\nreimbursed all costs and expenses, its administration of the deduction plan does not\namount to a “contribution or expenditure” because a “contribution” does not encompass\n“[a]n offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned,\nor refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt,” MCL\n169.204(3)(c), and an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n offer or tender of an\nexpenditure if expressly and unconditionally rejected or returned,” MCL 169.206(2)(e).\nHowever, this argument clearly lacks merit because the MEA-PAC’s offer to reimburse\nexpenses can hardly be said to constitute a “rejection, return, or refund” of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” When the school district collects and remits\npayments from MEA members to the MEA-PAC, it makes an “offer or tender” of a\n“contribution or expenditure.” To qualify for the “offer or tender” exception, the MEA-\nPAC would have to unconditionally “reject or return” the services of the school district,\nsomething which it neither does nor has any intention of doing. Because the school\ndistrict’s services are unconditionally accepted by the MEA-PAC, the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is not excluded from the definition of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure” under either section of MCFA. Finally, the obvious\nshould be observed, to wit, although the Legislature excluded from the definitions of\n“contribution” and “expenditure” “an offer or tender” of a “contribution or expenditure”\nthat has been rejected, returned, or refunded, there is no similar exclusion for\n“reimbursements,” an exclusion that should be thought to have been obvious, if intended.\nThe majority nonetheless intuits from the “reject or return” exception that “contribution”\nin MCL 169.204(1), “clearly requires . . . a net transfer of value.” Ante at 17. (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\ftherefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.”\n\nEven if a “public body” is entitled to rely on this exclusion, the majority errs by holding\n\nthat the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan falls “within the\n\nstatutory exception” because the “expenditure” cannot be characterized as “[a]n\n\nexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee.” As also discussed, I believe that\n\nthe majority errs by holding that a school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan does not constitute a “contribution.” This latter aspect of the majority’s\n\nopinion warrants brief further discussion.\n\n       (a) In circular fashion, the majority holds that the definition of “contribution”\n\nencompasses the term “expenditure” and, thus, because the school district’s\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute an “expenditure,” it also\n\ncannot be a “contribution.” The majority then states that “[t]he only other way that the\n\nadministration of the system could be a ‘contribution’ under the MCFA would be if\n\nadministering the system resulted in a ‘transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue . . . .’” Ante at 14. This assertion is erroneous. As discussed earlier, an “in-kind\n\ncontribution,” which is a “contribution . . . other than money,” also constitutes a\n\n“contribution.”   MCL 169.209(3).      Similarly, MCFA defines as a “contribution” a\n\n“payment.” MCL 169.204(1). The school district arguably makes a “payment” to the\n\nMEA-PAC when it transfers money from participating MEA members to the MEA-PAC.\n\nAlthough in these circumstances the school district only acts as a conduit, a\n\n“contribution” made at the direction of another person “shall be regarded as an\n\nexpenditure or contribution attributable to both persons . . . .” MCL 169.270.\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       (b) The majority further errs by concluding that its interpretation is necessary to\n\navoid absurd results. In discussing whether the administration of the payroll deduction\n\nplan constitutes a “transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value” and thus a\n\n“contribution,” the majority states:\n\n              There are two competing ways in which to interpret the word\n       “transfer” in the statute. The first way to read the statute would require that\n       any conveyance of value for services provided to a campaign, regardless of\n       whether the services are paid for, would constitute a contribution. The\n       second way to read the statute would require a net conveyance of value in\n       order to be a “transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value.”\n\n               We conclude that the statute must be read to require a net\n       conveyance of monetary value, as opposed to a mere exchange of value.\n       Any other interpretation of “contribution” would lead to an absurd result,\n       and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results. For example, if\n       the statute were to be interpreted in the manner the Secretary of State\n       suggests, then a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the normal\n       course of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because\n       it has transferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even\n       though the shop has been compensated for the cost of providing the\n       signage. Such an interpretation of “contribution” would defy common\n       sense, and we do not read the statute in this manner. [Ante at 15-16\n       (citations omitted).]\nBy emphasizing that its interpretation is necessary to avoid “absurd results,” the majority\n\nitself appears to concede that the more natural interpretation of the law is that asserted by\n\nthis dissent. Resort to “absurd results” analysis is generally necessary only to avoid an\n\ninterpretation that would otherwise flow from a statute by the application of traditional\n\nprinciples of interpretation.\n\n       In essence, the majority believes that it is necessary to read MCL 169.204(1) as if\n\nit referred to a “net transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value,” which it does\n\nnot, in order to avoid the allegedly “absurd result” to which our interpretation of MCL\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f169.204(1) would lead. What is this allegedly “absurd result”? What is this result that is\n\n“quite impossible that [the Legislature] could have intended”? Pub Citizen v United\n\nStates Dep’t of Justice, 491 US 440, 471; 109 S Ct 2558; 105 L Ed 2d 377 (1989)\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). What is this result that is “unthinkable” or “bizarre”? Green v\n\nBock Laundry Machine Co, 490 US 504, 527; 109 S Ct 1981; 104 L Ed 2d 557 (1989)\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring). What is this result that “cannot rationally . . . mean” what it\n\nseems to mean? Id. at 528.13 That there be no exchanges of value between a “public\n\nbody” and a partisan political action committee? That the government not further the\n\npartisan interests of a political action committee?      That taxpayer resources not be\n\nemployed to collect, and facilitate, partisan political contributions? While these results\n\nmay be “absurd” to the majority justices, we do not find these to be “absurd” at all. Once\n\nagain, the majority seems to equate an “absurd result” with a disagreeable result.\n\nCameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55, 84-86; 718 NW2d 784 (2006)\n\n(MARKMAN, J., concurring); Petersen v Magna Corp, 484 Mich 300, 370; 773 NW2d 564\n\n(2009) (MARKMAN, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the specific “absurd result” alleged here\n\nby the majority, that a print shop could not sell signs to a campaign because this would\n\nconstitute a “contribution,” is itself absurd. A print shop is not a “public body” and,\n\ntherefore, unlike a school district, is not regulated by § 57 of MCFA.\n\n\n\n13\n  Although I continue to abide by an “absurd results” rule-- albeit a vastly different\n“absurd results” rule than the majority justices-- the two justices who join this dissent do\nnot. See People v McIntire, 461 Mich 147, 152-160; 599 NW2d 102 (1999); cf.\nCameron v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 476 Mich 55, 78-80, 84-86; 718 NW2d 784 (2006)\n(MARKMAN, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f         (c) The majority also errs when it concludes that MCL 408.477 of the wages and\n\nfringe benefits act provides authority for the school district to administer the payroll\n\ndeduction plan. “[S]chool districts and school officers have only such powers as the\n\nstatutes expressly or impliedly grant to them.” Jacox v Van Buren Consol Sch Dist Bd of\n\nEd, 293 Mich 126, 128; 291 NW 247 (1940). “‘The extent of the authority of the\n\npeople’s public agents is measured by the statute from which they derive their authority,\n\nnot by their own acts and assumption of authority.’” Sittler v Mich College of Mining &\n\nTech Bd of Control, 333 Mich 681, 687; 53 NW2d 681 (1952) (citation omitted).\n\nContrary to the belief of the majority, the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan\n\nfor a political action committee is not expressly or impliedly granted to schools in any\n\nstatute.\n\n         While MCL 408.477 of the wages and fringe benefits act refers to payroll\n\ndeductions, it does not authorize school districts to administer payroll deductions for\n\npolitical action committees. MCL 408.477(1) provides in full:\n\n                Except for those deductions required or expressly permitted by law\n         or by a collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from\n         the wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an\n         employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established by a\n         corporation or labor organization under section 55 of the Michigan\n         campaign finance act, Act No. 388 of the Public Acts of 1976, being\n         section 169.255 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, without the full, free, and\n         written consent of the employee, obtained without intimidation or fear of\n         discharge for refusal to permit the deduction.[14]\n\n\n\n\n14\n     See also MCL 169.255(6).\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fFrom this statute, the majority summarily concludes that, “under the plain language of\n\nMCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan\n\nthat contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA enters into a collective bargaining\n\nagreement that expressly permits the deductions.” Ante at 18 n 29. Once again, the\n\nmajority has grossly misinterpreted a statute. MCL 408.477 has absolutely nothing to do\n\nwith whether a “public body” may administer a payroll deduction plan for the benefit of\n\nthe MEA-PAC. Rather, the statute describes the approval required for an employer to\n\ndeduct a portion of an employee’s wages and states that in order to deduct wages from an\n\nemployee, an employer must obtain the employee’s voluntary consent. The statute also\n\nprovides that such consent is not required when the wage deduction is expressly\n\npermitted by law or by a collective bargaining agreement.              The most that can be\n\ndiscerned from this statute as it pertains to the instant case is that, if the school district is\n\nto deduct wages from its employees, it must obtain the employees’ voluntary consent\n\nunless the deduction is expressly permitted by law or a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nHowever, neither MCL 408.477 nor any other statute provides authority for a “public\n\nbody” to administer a payroll deduction plan that contributes money to a political action\n\ncommittee. Therefore, even if the school district’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nplan did not constitute a “contribution” or an “expenditure,” which it clearly does, in my\n\njudgment, the school district still lacks the authority to administer such a plan because no\n\nstatute accords the school district this authority, and the school district only has the\n\nauthority accorded to it by statute. Indeed, as explained earlier, the Legislature has\n\naffirmatively and expressly forbidden a school district, or any other public body, from\n\nmaking a “contribution or expenditure” to a political action committee.\n\n\n                                               24\n\f                           VI. TREATMENT OF THIS CASE\n\n       Particularly striking in its resolution of this case has been the majority’s\n\nunprecedentedly dilatory treatment, followed abruptly by its unprecedentedly accelerated\n\ntreatment. The Court of Appeals issued its decision on August 28, 2008; this Court\n\nentered an order scheduling oral argument on the application for leave to appeal more\n\nthan eight months later on May 8, 2009; oral arguments were heard six months later on\n\nNovember 5, 2009; and leave to appeal was granted seven months later on June 4, 2010.\n\nWhen leave to appeal was granted, the majority justified this on the grounds that the\n\nCourt needed to be informed about the impact of Citizens United v Fed Election Comm,\n\n558 US ___; 130 S Ct 876; 175 L Ed 2d 753 (2010), a then-recent United States Supreme\n\nCourt decision. Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, 486 Mich 952 (2010). The three\n\ndissenting justices in the instant case, who also dissented from the earlier grant of leave,\n\ndescribed the complete lack of relevance of Citizens, asserting in pertinent part:\n\n             Unlike Citizens United, the issues in this case have nothing to do\n       with corporate free speech, nothing to do with labor union free speech,\n       nothing to do with the Federal Election Campaign Act, nothing to do with\n       Federal Election Commission rules or regulations, and indeed nothing to do\n       with campaign speech or the First Amendment. In short, it has nothing to\n       do with anything involved in Citizens United. Instead, it involves only\n       whether § 57 of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act bars a school district\n       from administering a payroll deduction plan for a political action\n       committee.\n\n              Indeed, neither party itself has suggested that this case is affected in\n       any way by Citizens United, nor sought any opportunity to file a\n       supplemental brief. Yet suddenly it is necessary that this Court delay\n       resolution of this case for what will be a minimum of seven or eight\n       additional months, on top of the six or seven months that have already\n       passed since oral argument. I am aware of no previous instance in which\n       this Court has held arguments on an application, taken no action in\n       response to such arguments for more than six months, and then granted\n\n\n                                             25\n\f      leave to appeal late during that term, ensuring that such case will not be\n      further considered during that term and that a decision will not be\n      forthcoming until, at the earliest, the beginning of the second calendar year,\n      2011, after arguments were initially heard. This, with regard to a case that\n      may affect the administrative processes of every school district across this\n      state.\n\n             This Court has been presented with substantial briefs from each\n      party. Each party has filed an original and supplemental brief, four amicus\n      briefs have been filed, and oral argument has taken place that lasted well\n      beyond the normal time allotted for such argument. We have heard from\n      the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Michigan AFL-CIO, the\n      Chamber of Commerce, the Michigan State Employee’s Association, and\n      the Mackinac Center, with a supplemental brief filed by the AFL-CIO and\n      two supplemental briefs filed by the Chamber of Commerce. This case\n      involves a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation, and no justice\n      has identified to any of the parties at oral argument, or at any later juncture,\n      any aspect of this case that has not been thoroughly addressed.\n\n             To grant leave to appeal under these circumstances constitutes an\n      utter waste of judicial resources, imposes an altogether unnecessary\n      expense upon the parties, and unconscionably delays resolution of an\n      important dispute of statewide importance for no proper reason. What\n      accounts for, and justifies, this delay? What is taking place here is an abuse\n      of the judicial process, and the majority owes considerably more\n      explanation for its actions than it has given. [Id. at 953 (MARKMAN, J.,\n      dissenting).]\nThe majority now summarily states in is opinion:\n\n             We note that because the issues presented in this case can be\n      resolved under Michigan law, we do not opine on the application of United\n      States Supreme Court caselaw. [Ante at 6 n 8.][15]\n\n\n\n\n15\n  Of course, whether “the issues presented in this case can be resolved under Michigan\nlaw” is irrelevant to whether United States Supreme Court caselaw interpreting the\nUnited States Constitution applies in any given case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fThe absence of any conceivable relevance of Citizens United underscores our concern\n\nthat the grant of leave to appeal in this case, following the argument on the application,\n\nrepresented a waste of judicial resources that imposed unnecessary expenses on the\n\nparties, while delaying resolution of an important dispute of statewide importance.\n\nIndeed, even before we heard oral arguments on the application, the United States\n\nSupreme Court specifically upheld Idaho’s absolute ban on the administration of payroll\n\ndeduction plans by public bodies to facilitate employee contributions to political action\n\ncommittees. Ysursa v Pocatello Ed Ass’n, 555 US ___; 129 S Ct 1093; 172 L Ed 2d 770\n\n(2009).\n\n      MCR 7.302(G)(1), which is now MCR 7.302(H)(1), was amended in 2003 to\n\nallow us discretion to order oral argument before deciding whether to grant leave to\n\nappeal. This rule created\n\n      an alternative procedure in those cases in which a majority of the Court\n      believes that an error or an injustice will result from a lower court decision,\n      yet in which there is not a sufficiently far-reaching or difficult legal issue to\n      warrant using the Court’s limited resources for full oral argument. [See\n      MCR 7.302, 469 Mich cxlvi (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nSince the inception of this rule, we have directed the clerk of the Court to schedule\n\narguments on whether to grant applications for leave in 280 cases. Of those cases, only\n\n14, including the instant case, resulted in a grant of the application. Of these 14 cases,\n\nnone involved a delay between argument on the application and the grant of leave\n\napproaching that involved in this case. Arguments here, which had already been delayed\n\nby more than eight months on the application, were followed by an additional seven-\n\nmonth delay before the application was even granted. Of the other 13 cases that followed\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fthe same double-hearing procedure, not a single one took seven months between the time\n\nof arguments on the application and the grant of leave; indeed, in a majority of those\n\ncases, the time elapsed was less than one month.\n\n       After granting leave to appeal, this Court again heard oral arguments in November\n\nof this year, the period for dissenting justices to respond to the majority opinion was then\n\ncompressed, and the majority has now, in December, issued an opinion in what\n\napproaches, if not exceeds, record time for the issuance of a major opinion of this Court.\n\nThe majority owes the parties and the public an explanation for their treatment of a case\n\nwhose resolution is so critical to maintaining the integrity of the governmental processes\n\nof our state.\n\n                                   VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       Section 57 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to make a\n\n“contribution or expenditure” for political purposes. The school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan in this case, remitting payments to the MEA-PAC,\n\nconstitutes both a “contribution” and an “expenditure” as defined by MCFA. The MEA-\n\nPAC’s offer to reimburse the school district for expenses incurred in its administration of\n\nthe plan does not remedy an otherwise clear violation of § 57. The majority’s contrary\n\ninterpretation undermines the objectives of the Legislature, which enacted § 57 to\n\nmandate the separation of the government from politics in order to maintain\n\ngovernmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent\n\ntaxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political activities. The payroll\n\ndeduction plan in this case is inconsistent with this legislative purpose and inconsistent\n\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fwith the language of the law. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n                                                    Stephen J.

We reverse the Court\n\n of Appeals’ judgment because a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\fsystem (the system) that remits funds to a segregated fund is not precluded by any\n\nprohibition in MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.\n\n        MCL 169.257(1), commonly referred to as § 57 of the Michigan Campaign\n\nFinance Act (MCFA),1 specifically prohibits a public body from using public resources to\n\ndo three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a contribution, and (3) “provide\n\nvolunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under\n\nsection 4(3)(a)” of the MCFA, MCL 169.204(3)(a).2 First, the administration of such a\n\nsystem is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA because the cost of administration is an\n\n“expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee,”3 which is an enumerated exception\n\nto the statutory definition of “expenditure.” Second, administration of the system is not a\n\n“contribution” as defined by the MCFA because there is no net conveyance of anything\n\nof monetary value made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. Last, a public\n\nschool’s administration of a payroll deduction system does not “provide volunteer\n\npersonal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section\n\n4(3)(a)”4 as defined by the MCFA because the MEA-PAC fully anticipates prepayment\n\n\n\n1\n    MCL 169.201 et seq.\n2\n    MCL 169.257(1).\n3\n    MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n4\n    MCL 169.257(1).\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\ffor any administration costs. Thus, the administration of a payroll deduction system by a\n\npublic school is permitted under the MCFA.\n\n                           I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n      Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary,\n\nincorporated labor organization that represents members employed by public schools,\n\ncolleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA’s political action committee,\n\nMEA-PAC, is a separate segregated fund under § 55 of the MCFA. MCL 169.255.\n\nAccording to the MEA, the MEA-PAC is funded in part by MEA member payroll\n\ndeductions. The MEA (or its affiliates) has entered into collective bargaining agreements\n\nwith various public school districts throughout the state that require the school district\n\nemployer to administer a payroll deduction plan for contributions to the MEA-PAC. The\n\ncurrent case involves such an agreement between the Kalamazoo County Education\n\nAssociation/Gull Lake Education Association and the Gull Lake Public Schools. The\n\nGull Lake collective bargaining agreement also requires the Gull Lake Public Schools to\n\nmake other payroll deductions, such as the payment of MEA dues and service fees. The\n\nMEA plans to pay the Gull Lake Public Schools, in advance, for all anticipated costs to\n\nGull Lake Public Schools attributable to administering payroll deductions to the MEA-\n\nPAC or any other separate segregated fund affiliated with the MEA. The MEA contends\n\nthat under this proposal, Gull Lake Public Schools would not incur any costs or expenses\n\nin administering the requested deductions because the Gull Lake Public Schools would be\n\npaid in advance for such costs and expenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       As a condition to implementing the collective bargaining agreement, a\n\nrepresentative of the Gull Lake Public Schools requested that the MEA obtain a\n\ndeclaratory ruling on the validity of the payroll deduction system. On August 22, 2006,\n\nthe MEA filed a request for a declaratory ruling with respondent, the Secretary of State.\n\nThe MEA detailed its proposal for payroll deductions to be made by the Gull Lake Public\n\nSchools and asserted that the administration of the payroll deductions by the school\n\ndistrict would not be an “expenditure” under the MCFA and would not violate § 57 of the\n\nMCFA, MCL 169.257. The MEA requested that the Gull Lake Public Schools be\n\nallowed to make and transmit payroll deductions requested by MEA members to MEA-\n\nPAC as long as the members had filled out voluntary consent forms and either the MEA\n\nor the MEA-PAC had paid the school district, in advance, for any costs associated with\n\nadministering those payroll deductions. The MEA also asked the Secretary of State for a\n\ndeclaratory ruling on what costs it should consider in determining the costs attributable to\n\nadministering the payroll deductions that are to be transmitted to the MEA-PAC.\n\n       On November 20, 2006, the Secretary of State ruled that the Gull Lake Public\n\nSchools could not make and transmit payroll deductions requested by MEA members to\n\nthe MEA-PAC because § 57 of the MCFA prohibits a public body from making\n\nexpenditures or collecting contributions for a political action committee. The ruling\n\nnoted that the Department of State and the Attorney General had both previously\n\nconcluded that a public body is prohibited from collecting and remitting contributions to\n\na committee through its administration of a payroll deduction plan. The ruling explained\n\nthat § 55 of the MCFA allows named private entities to make expenditures for the\n\nestablishment and administration and solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\n\n                                             4\n\ffund. However, the ruling stated that no explicit provision in the MCFA authorizes a\n\npublic body to do so and concluded that the school district is prohibited from expending\n\ngovernmental resources for a payroll deduction plan that deducts wages from its\n\nemployees on behalf of the MEA-PAC.\n\n         The Secretary of State’s ruling further concluded that paying the costs of\n\nadministering the payroll deductions in advance would not effectively avoid a violation\n\nof § 57. This conclusion was based on an analysis of this issue in a recent opinion of the\n\nAttorney General. OAG, 2005-2006, No 7187, p 81 (February 16, 2006). Because the\n\nSecretary of State concluded that administration of a payroll deduction system would\n\nviolate the MCFA, the ruling did not address what costs should be considered attributable\n\nto administering the payroll deductions or the dollar amount that should be prepaid.\n\n         The MEA petitioned for review of the declaratory ruling in the Ingham Circuit\n\nCourt.     On September 4, 2007, the trial court issued an opinion setting aside the\n\ndeclaratory ruling on the grounds that it was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. The trial court opined that if the costs of administration are paid in advance,\n\nadministration of payroll deductions does not result in transfer of money to a union’s\n\npolitical action committee and, therefore, an “expenditure” has not been made within the\n\nmeaning of the MCFA. Thus, the trial court held that a public body may administer\n\npayroll deductions as long as all the costs of making deductions are paid in advance.\n\n         The Secretary of State applied for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, which\n\nwas granted. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s opinion\n\nand held that, regardless of advance payment for the associated costs, a public school’s\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system is still an “expenditure” under the MCFA\n\n\n                                             5\n\fand thus prohibited.5       Judge WHITBECK dissented, and would have held that\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system is not an “expenditure”6 as the MCFA\n\ndefines it.\n\n         The MEA sought leave to appeal in this Court. This Court granted oral argument\n\non whether to grant the application7 and subsequently granted leave to appeal.8\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Mich Ed Ass’n v Secretary of State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1990658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1990658/mich-ed-assn-v-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

This is an issue of statutory construction, which we review de novo.9\n\n          To interpret the MCFA, we apply the established rules of statutory construction.\n\n“Assuming that the Legislature has acted within its constitutional authority, the purpose\n\nof statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.”10\n\nAccordingly, a Court must interpret the language of a statute in a manner that is\n\nconsistent with the legislative intent.11 In determining the legislative intent, the actual\n\nlanguage of the statute must first be examined.12 “As far as possible, effect should be\n\ngiven to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute.”13 When considering the correct\n\ninterpretation, a statute must be read as a whole.14 Individual words and phrases, while\n\nimportant, should be read in the context of the entire legislative scheme.15 In defining\n\nparticular words within a statute, a court “must ‘consider both the plain meaning of the\n\n9\n In re Investigation of March 1999 Riots in East Lansing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2227292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2227292/in-re-investigation-of-march-1999-riots/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383; 617\nNW2d 310 (2000).\n10\n  Potter v McLeary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1665997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1665997/potter-v-mcleary/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410; 774 NW2d 1 (2009), citing Sun Valley Foods\nCo v Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1984889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1984889/sun-valley-foods-co-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999).\n11\n     Potter, 484 Mich at 411.\n12\n     Id. at 410.\n13\n     Sun Valley, 460 Mich at 237.\n14\n     See id.\n15\n     Herman v Berrien Co, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"839423\"><a href=\"/opinion/839423/herman-v-berrien-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fcritical word or phrase as well as “its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.”’”16\n\nWhen a statute explicitly defines a term, the statutory definition controls.17\n\n         In applying these established rules of statutory construction, we start our analysis\n\nwith a review of the relevant statutory language.        Section 57 of the MCFA, MCL\n\n169.257(1), prohibits public bodies from using public resources to make expenditures,\n\ncontributions, or provide volunteer services that are excluded from the definition of\n\n“contribution” under § 4(3)(a) of that act, MCL 169.204(3)(a). The statute provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n                A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n         or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n         software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n         other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide\n         volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of\n         contribution under section 4(3)(a). [MCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added).]\n\n         Thus, § 57 specifically prohibits a public body from using, or authorizing the use\n\nof, public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a contribution,\n\nor (3) provide volunteer services that are excluded from the definition of “contribution”\n\nunder § 4(3)(a). The plain language of the statute does not prohibit any other activity.\n\nTherefore, if the administration of the payroll deduction system is not tantamount to\n\ndoing one of these three things, the administration of the system is permissible under\n\nMichigan law.\n\n\n16\n  Id., quoting Sun Valley, 460 Mich at 237, quoting Bailey v United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n145; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

EXPENDITURE\n\n       We first examine whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem that remits funds to the MEA-PAC is an impermissible expenditure under § 57.\n\n“Expenditure” is specifically defined by the MCFA, so this definition controls for\n\npurposes of applying § 57. The general definition of “expenditure” under the MCFA is\n\nset forth in § 6, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n               (1) “Expenditure” means a payment, donation, loan, or promise of\n       payment of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value for goods,\n       materials, services, or facilities in assistance of, or in opposition to, the\n       nomination or election of a candidate, or the qualification, passage, or\n       defeat of a ballot question. Expenditure includes, but is not limited to, any\n       of the following:\n\n             (a) A contribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable\n       monetary value for purposes of influencing the nomination or election of a\n       candidate or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n                                           * * *\n\n              (2) Expenditure does not include any of the following:\n\n              (a) An expenditure for communication by a person with the person’s\n       paid members or shareholders and those individuals who can be solicited\n       for contributions to a separate segregated fund under [MCL 169.255].\n                                           * * *\n\n               (c) An expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n       solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent\n       committee. [MCL 169.206 (emphasis added).]\n\n       Thus, MCL 169.206(1) details the general definition of “expenditure,” which is\n\nexpansive. It includes a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or\n\nanything of ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in\n\nassistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate, or the\n\n\n                                              9\n\fqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The definition also includes a\n\ncontribution or a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value for purposes of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate or the qualification, passage, or\n\ndefeat of a ballot question. However, despite its expansive scope, the statutory definition\n\nof “expenditure” contains explicit exceptions under MCL 169.206(2), outlining items that\n\ncannot be considered an expenditure under the MCFA even though they may qualify\n\nunder the expansive general definition outlined in MCL 169.206(1).\n\n         We now consider whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem is an “expenditure” as defined by the MCFA. The administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system does arguably provide services to the MEA and the MEA-PAC in\n\nfacilitating payroll deductions from members by providing personnel and computer\n\nservices. The system allows MEA members to authorize the school to automatically\n\ndeduct money from their paychecks and remit the funds to the MEA-PAC. The MEA-\n\nPAC is a separate segregated fund under MCL 169.255 because it has been established\n\nby the MEA, a labor organization, to make contributions to, and expenditures on behalf\n\nof, candidate committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n\npolitical committees, and independent committees.18 Thus, the payroll deduction system\n\n18\n     MCL 169.255(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n                A corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint\n         stock company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization\n         formed under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make\n         an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n         contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n         A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n         making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n\n\n                                              10\n\fadministers member contributions to a separate segregated fund. Although this process\n\nfalls within the general definition of “expenditure” under MCL 169.206(1), the\n\nadministration of such a system is explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under\n\nMCL 169.206(2)(c). To reiterate, MCL 169.206(2)(c) excludes from the definition of\n\n“expenditure” any “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.”19 A public\n\nschool’s administration of a payroll deduction falls squarely within the statutory\n\nexception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member contributions to their separate\n\nsegregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore, the administration of the system is not an\n\n“expenditure” under the MCFA.\n\n         The Secretary of State argues that the statutory exception in MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nshould not be applied to public bodies because the Legislature intended to treat public\n\nbodies differently from private entities and political action committees under the MCFA.\n\nHowever, this argument disregards the plain language of the statute. MCL 169.206(2)(c)\n\nis contained within the definitional provisions of the MCFA and includes no language\n\nlimiting its application to sections of the MCFA that deal only with private entities and\n\npolitical action committees. MCL 169.201(2), on the other hand, explicitly mandates that\n\n“[e]xcept as otherwise defined in this act, the words and phrases defined in [MCL\n\n169.202 to 169.212] shall, for the purposes of this act, have the meanings ascribed to\n\n\n\n         committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n         political committees, and independent committees.\n19\n     MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\fthem in those sections.” Thus, the statutory definition of “expenditure” controls and\n\napplies to the entire MCFA, including § 57, exceptions and all.\n\n           The Court of Appeals clearly erred by holding that a public school’s\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system is an expenditure. Without providing any\n\nindependent statutory analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that the administration of\n\nthe system is an expenditure by relying solely on the Secretary of State’s prior\n\ninterpretation of the term. The Court of Appeals reasoned:\n\n                  The Secretary previously issued an interpretive statement indicating\n           that “the department interprets the term ‘expenditure’ to include the costs\n           associated with collecting and delivering contributions to a committee” and\n           that “[a] payroll deduction system is one method of collecting and\n           delivering contributions.” Interpretative Statement to Mr. Robert LaBrant\n           (November 14, 2005).[20]\n\nWithout any independent statutory analysis, the Court of Appeals then concluded: “We\n\nfind nothing in the plain language of the MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates\n\nsomething that otherwise constitutes an expenditure.”21\n\n           The Court of Appeals erred by considering whether a supposedly illegal\n\nexpenditure could be cured without first analyzing whether the Secretary of State’s\n\ninterpretation of the term “expenditure” comported with the statute. The Secretary of\n\nState’s interpretation of the MCFA is not binding on the judiciary, and the Court of\n\nAppeals should have independently considered whether the administration of a payroll\n\n\n\n20\n     Mich Ed Ass’n, 280 Mich App at 486.\n21\n     Id.\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                                          22\ndeduction system is an “expenditure.”           Most importantly, the Secretary of State’s\n\ninterpretation of “expenditure” is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the relevant\n\nstatutory language. The Secretary of State’s interpretation of “expenditure” includes\n\ncosts associated with collecting and delivering contributions to a committee. But, as\n\npreviously explained, the statutory definition of “expenditure” explicitly excludes these\n\ncosts.    As a result, the Court of Appeals clearly erred by adopting respondent’s\n\ninterpretation of “expenditure.”    The plain language of the statute dictates that the\n\nadministration costs at issue are excluded from the statutory term “expenditure.”\n\n         Administration of a payroll deduction system is an “expenditure for the\n\nestablishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated\n\nfund or independent committee,” and thus is an enumerated exception to the statutory\n\ndefinition of “expenditure.”    Therefore, the administration of the payroll deduction\n\nsystem is not an “expenditure” as defined by the MCFA and is not prohibited by § 57 on\n\nthat ground.\n\n                                   B. CONTRIBUTION\n\n         We next examine whether a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem is an impermissible “contribution” under the MCFA.23           “Contribution,” like\n\n\n\n22\n  This Court is not bound by the Secretary of State’s interpretations of the law or by\nAttorney General opinions.

The definition of “contribution” under the MCFA is set\n\nforth in MCL 169.204, which provides:\n\n              (1) “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n      expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n      loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n      a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made\n      for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or\n      for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.\n\n             (2) Contribution includes the full purchase price of tickets or\n      payment of an attendance fee for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies,\n      testimonials, and other fund-raising events; an individual’s own money or\n      property other than the individual’s homestead used on behalf of that\n      individual’s candidacy; the granting of discounts or rebates not available to\n      the general public; or the granting of discounts or rebates by broadcast\n      media and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for\n      the same office; and the endorsing or guaranteeing of a loan for the amount\n      the endorser or guarantor is liable.\n\n             (3) Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n             (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n      payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n      individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n      without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n      indirectly, repaid.\n\n            (b) Food and beverages, not to exceed $100.00 in value during a\n      calendar year, which are donated by an individual and for which\n      reimbursement is not given.\n\n            (c) An offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and\n      unconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within\n      30 business days after receipt.

The only other way that the administration of the system could be a “contribution”\n\nunder the MCFA would be if administering the system resulted in a “transfer of anything\n\nof ascertainable monetary value . . . made for the purpose of influencing the nomination\n\nor election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n         The Secretary of State argues that the actual and intangible costs associated with\n\nthe administration of a payroll deduction system constitute a contribution because there is\n\na transfer of something of ascertainable monetary value from the school district to the\n\nMEA-PAC and the transfer, although made pursuant to a collective bargaining\n\nagreement, is made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The Secretary\n\nof State asserts that the labor and computer resources that are expended to administer the\n\npayroll deduction system have an ascertainable monetary value, and the fact that they are\n\nexpended for the benefit of the MEA-PAC conveys value to the MEA-PAC.                      The\n\nSecretary of State further argues that prepayment for the services does not negate the\n\ntransfer because MEA-PAC still receives the benefit of the services.\n\n         We disagree with this interpretation of the word “transfer” in the statute. Because\n\n“transfer” is a nontechnical word that is not defined within the statute, we first look to the\n\n24\n     Tryc, 451 Mich at 136.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fplain meaning of the term to ascertain what the Legislature intended by using “transfer”\n\nto define a “contribution.”25 The first dictionary definition of “transfer” is “to convey or\n\nremove from one place, person, etc., to another.”26 In order for there to be a contribution,\n\n“anything of ascertainable monetary value” must be conveyed from one entity to another.\n\n         There are two competing ways in which to interpret the word “transfer” in the\n\nstatute. The first way to read the statute would require that any conveyance of value for\n\nservices provided to a campaign, regardless of whether the services are paid for, would\n\nconstitute a contribution.    The second way to read the statute would require a net\n\nconveyance of value in order to be a “transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue.”\n\n         We conclude that the statute must be read to require a net conveyance of monetary\n\nvalue, as opposed to a mere exchange of value.               Any other interpretation of\n\n“contribution” would lead to an absurd result, and statutes must be construed to prevent\n\nabsurd results.27 For example, if the statute were to be interpreted in the manner the\n\nSecretary of State suggests, then a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the\n\nnormal course of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because it has\n\ntransferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even though the shop has been\n\ncompensated for the cost of providing the signage.             Such an interpretation of\n\n\n25\n MCL 8.3a; Oakland Co Bd of Rd Comm’rs v Mich Prop & Cas Guaranty Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741734/oakland-county-bd-v-mich-property-cas-guar/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604; 575 NW2d 751 (1998).\n26\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n27\n     McAuley v Gen Motors Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1300171\"><a href=\"/opinion/1300171/mcauley-v-general-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518; 578 NW2d 282 (1998).\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f“contribution” would defy common sense, and we do not read the statute in this manner.\n\nInstead, we conclude that the statute requires a net conveyance of “anything of monetary\n\nvalue” in order for there to be a campaign contribution. If costs for administering the\n\npayroll deduction system are paid in advance, there is no net conveyance of anything of\n\nmonetary value, and there is no contribution.\n\n       Furthermore, our conclusion that a “contribution” under MCL 169.204(1) requires\n\na net transfer of value comports with the remainder of that section, which specifically\n\nexcludes from the statutory definition of “contribution” any “contribution if expressly and\n\nunconditionally rejected, returned, or refunded in whole or in part within 30 business\n\ndays after receipt.” MCL 169.204(3)(c). In other words, if the contribution is rejected,\n\nreturned, or refunded, it is no longer a “contribution” under the MCFA. Moreover, MCL\n\n169.204(2) explains that a “contribution” includes “the granting of discounts or rebates\n\nnot available to the general public . . . .” This implies that when an entity provides\n\nproducts or services at full price, the entity is not making a contribution. Thus, the statute\n\nclearly requires that there be a net transfer of value in order for there to be a contribution\n\nunder the MCFA.\n\n       The MEA plans to prepay the school district for all ascertainable costs associated\n\nwith the administration of a payroll deduction system, and in fact asked the Secretary of\n\nState for a declaratory ruling regarding the costs to be prepaid. The administration of the\n\npayroll deduction system will not result in a net transfer of anything of ascertainable\n\nmonetary value as all costs will be ascertained and prepaid. Accordingly, there is no\n\ncontribution under the MCFA, and a public school’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system is not prohibited by § 57 on that ground.\n\n\n                                             17\n\f        Additionally, a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not\n\nan impermissible contribution under the MCFA because the system is not administered\n\n“for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the\n\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.”28 When a public body administers\n\na payroll deduction plan, it does not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a\n\nballot question. Rather, administering the plan is one step removed: it merely allows\n\nsomeone else to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a political issue. The\n\npublic body administers the plan simply because it is required to do so as part of a labor\n\ncontract between the public body and its employees. Consequently, because a public\n\nschool’s administration of a payroll deduction system is not done for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing a political issue, the administration of the system is not a contribution under\n\nthe MCFA.29\n\n\n\n28\n     MCL 169.204(1).\n29\n   A public body has the authority to administer payroll deduction plans. The wages and\nfringe benefits act, MCL 408.477, provides that\n\n        [e]xcept for those deductions required or expressly permitted . . . by a\n        collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from the\n        wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an\n        employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established . . . under\n        [MCL 169.255] without the full, free and written consent of the\n        employee . . . .\nThus, under the plain language of MCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to\nadminister a payroll deduction plan that contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA\nenters into a collective bargaining agreement that expressly permits the deductions.\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\f                        C. VOLUNTEER PERSONAL SERVICES\n\n         Lastly, we examine whether a public school’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system impermissibly “provide[s] volunteer personal services that are excluded\n\nfrom the definition of contribution under section 4(3)(a)” of the MCFA. As noted above,\n\n§ 4(3) provides:\n\n               Contribution does not include any of the following:\n\n                (a) Volunteer personal services provided without compensation, or\n         payments of costs incurred of less than $500.00 in a calendar year by an\n         individual for personal travel expenses if the costs are voluntarily incurred\n         without any understanding or agreement that the costs shall be, directly or\n         indirectly, repaid. [MCL 169.201(3).]\n\n         Although such services are thus not considered a contribution for purposes of the\n\nrest of the MCFA, § 57 specifically indicates that public bodies cannot use public\n\nresources to provide volunteer services that are not compensated.             However, the\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction system at issue does not involve volunteer\n\nservices by public employees because the MEA intends to prepay for all services\n\nrendered. Because volunteer services are not defined by the statute, we again look to the\n\nplain meaning of the terms to discern the legislative intent. Dictionary definitions of\n\n“volunteer” include “a person who performs a service willingly and without pay.”30\n\nWillingness to perform an activity is not enough to fall within the scope of this\n\nsubsection; the activity must also be performed without pay. In this case, the MEA fully\n\nanticipates payment and plans to prepay for any administration costs. As a result, a\n\n\n30\n     Random House Webster’s College Dictionary (1997).\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fpublic school’s administration of a payroll deduction system does not “provide volunteer\n\npersonal services that are excluded from the definition of contribution under section\n\n4(3)(a)” of the MCFA and is not prohibited by § 57 on this final ground. Therefore, the\n\nadministration of a payroll deduction system by a public school is permitted under the\n\nMCFA.\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n         A public school may administer payroll deductions for its employees who remit\n\nfunds to the MEA-PAC, because MCL 169.257(1) only prohibits a public body from\n\nusing public resources to do three things: (1) make an expenditure, (2) make a\n\ncontribution, and (3) provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\ndefinition of “contribution” under MCL 169.204(3)(a). First, the administration of the\n\nsystem at issue is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA because the cost of\n\nadministration is an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,”31 which is an\n\nenumerated exception to the statutory definition of “expenditure.”                 Second,\n\nadministration of the system is not a “contribution” as defined by the MCFA because\n\nthere is no net conveyance of anything of monetary value made for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or\n\ndefeat of a ballot question. Last, a public school’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nsystem does not “provide volunteer personal services that are excluded from the\n\n\n31\n     MCL 169.206(2)(c).\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fdefinition of contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)]” because the MEA-PAC fully\n\nanticipates prepayment for any administration costs. Thus, the administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction system by a public school is permitted under the MCFA, and the Court of\n\nAppeals erred by concluding that it is not. We reverse the judgment of the Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n                                                       Diane M.

(dissenting).\n\n      The issue in this case concerns the Legislature’s mandated separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities. The Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA)\n\nprohibits a “public body” from using public resources to make any “contribution or\n\nexpenditure” for political purposes. MCL 169.257(1). The majority concludes that a\n\nschool district’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to the\n\nMichigan Education Association’s Political Action Committee (MEA-PAC) “is not\n\nprecluded by any prohibition in MCL 169.257(1) and is therefore permitted.” Ante at 1.\n\nI respectfully dissent, and believe that a school district’s administration of a payroll\n\ndeduction plan that remits funds to a partisan political action committee (a) constitutes a\n\n“contribution” because public resources are being used to advance the political objectives\n\nof the committee and (b) constitutes an “expenditure” because public “services” and\n\n“facilities in assistance of” these same political objectives are being provided. Thus, the\n\n\n                                            1\n\fschool district’s payroll deduction plan is prohibited by § 57 of the MCFA, MCL\n\n169.257. This interpretation is consistent not only with the language of the statute, but\n\nalso with the evident purpose of § 57, which is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeals.\n\n                                I. FACTS AND HISTORY\n\n       Petitioner, the Michigan Education Association (MEA), is a voluntary,\n\nincorporated labor organization that represents approximately 136,000 members\n\nemployed by public schools, colleges, and universities throughout Michigan. The MEA-\n\nPAC is a separate segregated political fund established by the MEA in accordance with\n\n§ 55 of MCFA, MCL 169.255.            The MEA-PAC is significantly funded by payroll\n\ndeductions of MEA members who have authorized the deductions. The purpose of the\n\nMEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA in politics, by\n\nelecting candidates favored by the MEA and by furthering the enactment of MEA\n\nlegislative and executive policy initiatives.\n\n       As a public-employee labor organization, the MEA has entered into collective\n\nbargaining agreements with various public school districts across the state. Some number\n\nof these agreements, including that between the MEA’s locally affiliated Kalamazoo\n\nCounty/Gull Lake Education Associations and the Gull Lake Community Schools (the\n\nschool district), require that a school district administer a payroll deduction plan for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fcontributions of MEA members to the MEA-PAC. In return, the MEA pays the school\n\ndistrict the costs of the plan’s administration.\n\n       On August 22, 2006, the MEA filed a request for a declaratory ruling with\n\nrespondent, the Secretary of State, to determine whether the school district could continue\n\nto make and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC.1 Respondent ruled that,\n\nabsent express statutory authority, the school district is prohibited from expending public\n\nresources for a payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-PAC. The MEA appealed\n\nto the circuit court, which held that respondent’s ruling was “arbitrary, capricious and an\n\nabuse of discretion,” reasoning that, although the school district’s administration of the\n\nplan constitutes an “expenditure” under MCFA, when the costs of administering the plan\n\nhave been reimbursed, “no transfer of money to the MEA-PAC has occurred, and\n\ntherefore an ‘expenditure’ has not been made within the meaning of the MCFA.”\n\n       In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 57 of MCFA\n\nprohibits a “public body,” such as a school district, from using public resources “to make\n\na contribution or expenditure.” According to the Court, the costs associated with the plan\n\nconstitute an “expenditure,” and the reimbursement of such costs does not alter that\n\nconclusion.

PURPOSE OF § 57\n\n         “It is well settled that the Legislature of this state is empowered to enact laws to\n\npromote and regulate political campaigns and candidacies.” Council No 11, AFSCME v\n\nCivil Serv Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222794\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222794/council-11-v-civil-service-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395; 292 NW2d 442 (1980) (citations omitted). The\n\npeople of Michigan have granted the Legislature broad powers to regulate elections.\n\nAmong other things, our Constitution empowers the Legislature to set forth the\n\nqualifications of electors; the time, place, and manner of elections; and limitations on\n\nterms of office. Const 1963, art 2, §§ 1 through 10. Furthermore, Const 1963, art 2, § 4\n\nrequires the Legislature to preserve the integrity of elections, providing in pertinent part:\n\n                The legislature shall enact laws to preserve the purity of elections, to\n         preserve the secrecy of the ballot, to guard against abuses of the elective\n         franchise, and to provide for a system of voter registration and absentee\n         voting.\n\nCharged to preserve the “purity of elections” and to “guard against abuses of the elective\n\nfranchise,” the Legislature enacted MCL 169.257, commonly referred to as § 57 of\n\nMCFA. Section 57 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to “make a\n\n2\n    See the discussion in part VI of this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fcontribution or expenditure” for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of\n\na candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. The clear\n\npurpose of § 57, as reflected in its language, is to mandate the separation of the\n\ngovernment from politics in order to maintain governmental neutrality in elections,\n\npreserve fair democratic processes, and prevent taxpayer funds from being used to\n\nsubsidize partisan political activities.3\n\n                                       IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       MCL 169.257(1) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n              A public body or an individual acting for a public body shall not use\n       or authorize the use of funds, personnel, office space, computer hardware or\n       software, property, stationery, postage, vehicles, equipment, supplies, or\n       other public resources to make a contribution or expenditure or provide\n       volunteer personal services that are excluded from the definition of\n       contribution under [MCL 169.204(3)(a)].\nThere is no question that a school district constitutes a “public body” within the meaning\n\nof § 57.4 Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether a school district’s administration\n\nof a payroll deduction plan that remits funds to a political action committee constitutes a\n\n\n3\n  See also, e.g., the political activities by public employees act, MCL 15.401 et seq.\n(providing that an employee of the state or local unit of government may not engage in\npolitical affairs during working hours); the Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act,\nMCL 432.201 et seq. (providing that members, employees, or agents of the Michigan\nGaming Control Board may not engage in political activity for the duration of their\nemployment); and Civil Service Rule 1-12.6 (prohibiting state employees from\nparticipating in political activities during working hours).\n4\n   MCFA defines a “public body” to include “[a] county, city, township, village,\nintercounty, intercity, or regional governing body; a council, school district, special\ndistrict, or municipal corporation; or a board, department, commission, or council or an\nagency of a board, department, commissioner, or council.” MCL 169.211(6)(c).\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f“contribution or expenditure” within the meaning of the same provision. If the plan does,\n\nit is expressly prohibited.\n\n                                 A. “CONTRIBUTION”\n\n       MCL 169.204(1) defines a “contribution” as follows:\n              “Contribution” means a payment, gift, subscription, assessment,\n       expenditure, contract, payment for services, dues, advance, forbearance,\n       loan, or donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value, or\n       a transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value to a person, made for\n       the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for\n       the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.[5]\nAn “in-kind contribution” is defined as a “contribution . . . other than money.” MCL\n\n169.209(3).\n\n       The school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan that facilitates\n\npayments to the MEA-PAC constitutes a prohibited “contribution.” First, the school\n\ndistrict uses a variety of public resources to administer the plan. For example, the school\n\ndistrict must use its paper, pens, and copiers to develop and execute payroll deduction\n\nauthorization forms; school personnel must collect, enter, and monitor the data of\n\nparticipating MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must\n\nbe specifically configured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-\n\nPAC; school personnel must then be prepared to respond to individual teachers who find\n\nit necessary from time to time to adjust or correct or withdraw their own deduction\n\nauthorizations; and this process must necessarily involve the use of public office space,\n\nequipment, and employee time.\n\n5\n  The MEA-PAC is a “person” because, as a separate segregated fund, it functions as the\nresult of an organization or group of persons acting jointly. See MCL 169.211(1).\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f       Second, the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan\n\nconstitutes something of “ascertainable monetary value” because there is inherent value\n\nto the MEA-PAC in having payroll deductions automatically taken from members’ wages\n\nas opposed to requiring individual solicitations by the MEA-PAC. That there is such\n\n“ascertainable monetary value” is self-evident from the very fact that the MEA-PAC has\n\naffirmatively sought out the assistance of the school district and has litigated to the\n\nhighest court of this state an appeal asserting its right to enter into the instant agreement\n\nwith the school district. Parties do not typically enter into contracts absent a belief that\n\nthe rights or benefits accorded them under the contract have some “ascertainable\n\nmonetary value,” and the instant contract seems no different. Such value can almost\n\ncertainly be identified as the sum of (a) the additional contributions resulting from the\n\nease of the payroll deduction process compared to a political contribution process in\n\nwhich individual solicitations must be undertaken and (b) the reduced administrative and\n\ntransactional costs of the former process compared to the latter process. The MEA\n\nobviously prefers the payroll deduction process because it is a more efficient, and a more\n\nproductive, process by which to secure funding for its political activities. The school\n\ndistrict is not incidental to this process, but constitutes an indispensable element.\n\nWithout the school district’s contracted-for services, some lesser amount of contributions\n\nwould presumably be raised on behalf of the MEA-PAC, and at a greater cost.\n\n       Third, the services undertaken on behalf of the MEA-PAC are “made for the\n\npurpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification,\n\npassage, or defeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.204(1), because, as discussed earlier,\n\nthe purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the involvement of the MEA\n\n\n                                             7\n\fin partisan politics.6 Thus, the school district’s administration of the deduction plan\n\nconstitutes a “contribution,” as that term is defined by MCL 169.204(1).7 Because the\n\nschool district employs public resources to make this “contribution,” its administration of\n\nthe deduction plan is a straightforward violation of § 57 of MCFA.\n\n       Moreover, the administration of the payroll deduction plan also constitutes an “in-\n\nkind contribution,” defined by MCL 169.209(3), as a “contribution . . . other than\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The majority states that “[w]hen a public body administers a payroll deduction plan, it\ndoes not do so in an attempt to influence a political race or a ballot question.” Ante at 17.\nHowever, the majority fails to recognize that MCL 169.204(1) defines “contribution” as\n“a payment . . . made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a\ncandidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question.” (Emphasis\nadded.) Therefore, the pertinent question is not whether the “public body” itself is\nattempting to influence a political race or ballot question, but whether the payments that\nresult from its administration of the payroll deduction plan are intended for that purpose.\nIt is obvious here that the “payment[s] [are] made for the purpose of influencing the\nnomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification, passage, or defeat of a\nballot question.” This is the purpose that individual MEA members have in mind when\nthey authorize payments, and it is the purpose that the MEA-PAC has in mind when it\nreceives payments from the school district. It is equally obvious that the school district\nitself must be fully cognizant of this purpose both when it receives payments from\nindividual MEA members and when it delivers payments to the MEA-PAC. The fact that\nthe school district itself might not care whether such payments will influence a political\nrace or ballot question does not alter that the purpose of these payments is to do precisely\nthat.\n7\n The majority further errs in its analysis when it concludes that administration of the plan\n“merely allows someone else to make a contribution for the purpose of influencing a\npolitical issue,” ante at 17 (emphasis in original), i.e., the MEA member who has\nauthorized the payroll deduction. Instead, the school district itself makes both a\n“contribution,” and an “in-kind contribution,” by providing valuable services to the\nMEA-PAC in aid and furtherance of its political activities. That is, quite independently\nof the contributions of individual MEA members, the school district contributes\nsomething of further “ascertainable monetary value” to the MEA-PAC.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fmoney.”8 Although it is clearly possible to quantify the time spent by employees and the\n\nresources expended by the school district in administering the deduction plan, and\n\nthereby to ascertain the cost of such a “contribution” to the school district itself, it is\n\nconsiderably more difficult to quantify the intangible benefits that the MEA receives\n\nfrom the deduction plan. Moreover, it is quite certain that these benefits substantially\n\noutweigh the costs to the school district, and therefore cannot be calculated simply by\n\nreference to the school district’s costs. The most significant of these is simply the extent\n\nof access to a district’s MEA membership that is afforded to the MEA-PAC by the\n\ndeduction plan. Such access avoids any need on the part of the MEA-PAC to establish its\n\nown administrative apparatus for political fundraising, vitiates its need to engage in\n\ncostly mailings and alternative forms of communications with its members, and dispenses\n\nwith its burden of having to process checks, money orders, or credit cards from\n\ncontributors, as would have been necessary for any other solicitor of political\n\ncontributions. As MEA’s counsel at oral argument acknowledged, this method has\n\nproved an “effective” means to raise money.             Almost certainly, the marginal\n\nadministrative costs of the payroll deduction plan to the school district, which already\n\nmay have in place a mechanism by which taxes and charitable contributions can be\n\n\n\n8\n  Respondent and the amici curiae supporting her devoted a significant portion of their\nbriefs and time at oral arguments to explaining how the school district’s administration of\nthe deduction plan amounts to an “in-kind contribution,” and yet the majority fails to\neven address this argument. Although the majority provides no explanation or\njustification for this omission, I am nonetheless sympathetic to its plight. It is just too\ndifficult sometimes to argue that an animal that looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and\nsquawks like a duck is not a “duck.”\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fdeducted from employees’ paychecks, will be less than the marginal administrative costs\n\nof an equivalent plan to the MEA, which does not have a similar mechanism in place.\n\nThe difference between these respective administrative costs can fairly be described as an\n\n“in-kind contribution” by the school district to the MEA-PAC, however difficult it may\n\nbe to quantify in dollars. It is a “contribution . . . other than money” that is made for the\n\n“purpose of influencing the nomination or election of a candidate, or for the qualification,\n\npassage, or defeat of a ballot question.”\n\n                                  B. “EXPENDITURE”\n\n       Section 57 of MCFA also prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to\n\nmake an “expenditure.” An “expenditure” is defined as\n\n       a payment, donation, loan, or promise of payment of money or anything of\n       ascertainable monetary value for goods, materials, services, or facilities in\n       assistance of, or in opposition to, the nomination or election of a candidate,\n       or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question. [MCL\n       169.206(1).]\nThe school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan on behalf of the MEA-\n\nPAC constitutes a prohibited “expenditure” because the school district directly provides\n\n“services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC. The school district provides\n\n“services” to the MEA-PAC in its administration of the deduction plan by developing and\n\nexecuting payroll deduction authorization forms; by collecting, entering, and monitoring\n\nthe data of MEA members into computers and accounting software, all of which must be\n\nconfigured to record, track, and transmit payroll deductions to the MEA-PAC; and by\n\naccommodating individual teachers who find it necessary from time to time to adjust or\n\ncorrect or withdraw their deduction authorizations. Further, the school district provides\n\n“facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC through the use of public office space and\n\n\n                                             10\n\fequipment. These “services” and “facilities in assistance of” the MEA-PAC are, once\n\nagain, made for the purpose of “the nomination or election of a candidate, or the\n\nqualification, passage, or defeat of a ballot question,” MCL 169.206(1)(a), because, as\n\ndiscussed previously, the purpose of the MEA-PAC is to facilitate and coordinate the\n\ninvolvement of the MEA in politics, by electing candidates favored by the MEA and by\n\nenacting MEA legislative and policy initiatives. Thus, the school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan constitutes an “expenditure” as that term is defined by MCL\n\n169.206(1)(a) and is specifically prohibited.\n\n       The majority concedes that the school district’s administration of the deduction\n\nplan “falls within the general definition of ‘expenditure’ under MCL 169.206(1) . . . .”\n\nAnte at 10. However, the majority holds that the plan also falls within a specific statutory\n\nexclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.” See ante at 10. This exception\n\nprovides that an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n expenditure for the establishment,\n\nadministration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or\n\nindependent committee.” MCL 169.206(2)(c). According to the majority, a school\n\ndistrict’s administration of a payroll deduction plan that remits payments to a political\n\naction committee constitutes an “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\n\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee” and\n\nis, therefore, allowed under § 57. Ante at 13. However, the majority overlooks that a\n\n“public body,” such as a school district, is not authorized to “establish” a separate\n\nsegregated fund under MCFA and, therefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion.\n\n       Instead, this exclusion is clearly designed to apply only to corporations and labor\n\norganizations that possess the authority to create, establish, administer, or fund separate\n\n\n                                            11\n\fsegregated funds in the first place. This interpretation, limiting the § 6(2)(c) exclusion to\n\ncorporations and labor organizations, is a necessary implication from the structure of\n\nMCFA for three reasons. First, § 54 of MCFA, MCL 169.254, imposes the same rule,\n\nprohibiting the making of a “contribution or expenditure,” on corporations and labor\n\norganizations that § 57 imposes on public bodies. In pertinent part, § 54 provides:\n\n             Except with respect to the exceptions and conditions in . . . section\n       55 [MCL 169.255]. . . a corporation, joint stock company, domestic\n       dependent sovereign, or labor organization shall not make a contribution or\n       expenditure . . . . [MCL 169.254(1) (emphasis added).]\n       Second, unlike § 57, § 54 does not constitute an absolute prohibition against\n\nmaking a “contribution or expenditure;” rather, pursuant to § 55,\n\n       [a] corporation organized on a for profit or nonprofit basis, a joint stock\n       company, a domestic dependent sovereign, or a labor organization formed\n       under the laws of this or another state or foreign country may make an\n       expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund to be used for political purposes.\n       A separate segregated fund established under this section shall be limited to\n       making contributions to, and expenditures on behalf of, candidate\n       committees, ballot question committees, political party committees,\n       political committees, and independent committees. [MCL 169.255(1).]\n       Third, there is no similar counterpart in § 57 that allows a “public body” to make\n\n“an expenditure for the establishment and administration and solicitation of contributions\n\nto a separate segregated fund . . . .” Thus, under § 55, the only entities allowed to\n\nestablish a separate segregated fund are corporations, joint stock companies, domestic\n\ndependent sovereigns, or labor organizations, such as the MEA. Considered together,\n\n§ 55 and the § 6(2)(c) exclusion that permits an “expenditure for the establishment,\n\nadministration, or solicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund” provide a\n\nlimited mechanism allowing entities such as the MEA to create, establish, administer, or\n\n\n                                             12\n\ffund a separate segregated fund for purposes that would otherwise be disallowed by § 54.\n\nIn contrast, a “public body,” such as a school district, is not entitled to create, establish,\n\nadminister, or fund a separate segregated fund, under § 55 or any other provision, and\n\nthus may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.”\n\n       Even if, as the majority claims, the § 6(2)(c) exclusion is not limited to § 55\n\nentities, the majority’s application of the exclusion remains utterly illogical.         The\n\nmajority concludes that although a school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan constitutes an “expenditure,” it is nevertheless\n\n       explicitly excluded from the statutory definition under MCL\n       169.206(2)(c) . . . [, which] excludes from the definition of “expenditure”\n       any “expenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of\n       contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee.” A\n       public school’s administration of a payroll deduction falls squarely within\n       the statutory exception. The system is set up to facilitate MEA member\n       contributions to their separate segregated fund, the MEA-PAC. Therefore,\n       the administration of the system is not an “expenditure” under the MCFA.\n\n                                           * * *\n\n              Most importantly, the Secretary of State’s interpretation of\n       “expenditure” is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the relevant\n       statutory language. The Secretary of State’s interpretation of “expenditure”\n       includes costs associated with collecting and delivering contributions to a\n       committee. But . . . the statutory definition of “expenditure” explicitly\n       excludes these costs. . . . The plain language of the statute dictates that the\n       administration costs at issue are excluded from the statutory term\n       “expenditure.” [Ante at 10, 12 (emphasis omitted).]\nThe majority thus concludes that the administration of a payroll deduction plan falls\n\n“squarely within the statutory exception.” Under MCL 169.206(2)(c), an “expenditure”\n\ndoes not encompass what would otherwise be an “expenditure” for (a) establishment of a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee, (b) administration of a separate\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fsegregated fund or independent committee, or (c) solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee. Thus, in order to fall within the\n\npurview of this exception, a “public body” must be engaged in one of these enumerated\n\nactivities. In this case, however, the school district is engaged in none.\n\n       First, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the establishment of a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee because the separate segregated fund,\n\nthe MEA-PAC, has already been established by the MEA. In any event, the school\n\ndistrict could not establish a separate segregated fund in the first place, because that\n\nauthority is limited to the entities enumerated in § 55 (corporations, joint stock\n\ncompanies, domestic dependent sovereigns, and labor organizations).\n\n       Second, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the administration\n\nof a separate segregated fund or independent committee because the school district is not\n\n“administering” the MEA-PAC; rather, the school district is simply administering the\n\npayroll deduction plan that remits funds to the MEA-PAC. That is, the school district\n\nmakes no determinations at all concerning amounts of funds to be raised from MEA\n\nmembers or other funding sources; the nature and substance of communications to MEA\n\nmembers and other funding sources about the need and urgency of such contributions; the\n\nidentification of political candidates and causes as beneficiaries of the MEA-PAC, and in\n\nwhat amounts; or strategies for optimizing the impact of MEA-PAC participation in\n\npolitical campaigns and causes. The majority, however, holds that “[t]he plain language\n\nof the statute dictates that the administration costs at issue are excluded from the statutory\n\nterm ‘expenditure.’” Ante at 12. In so asserting, the majority misinterprets the statute,\n\nbecause the only administrative costs that are excluded under this exclusion are those\n\n\n                                             14\n\fassociated with administering a “separate segregated fund or independent committee.”\n\nMCL 169.206(2)(c).      That the school district is administering a process by which\n\npayments are remitted to such a fund is hardly the equivalent of administering the fund\n\nitself, such that the § 6(2)(c) exclusion would apply. The majority is badly confused in\n\nthis regard.\n\n       Third, the school district is not making an “expenditure” for the solicitation of\n\ncontributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee; rather, the school\n\ndistrict is using public resources for processing payments to the MEA-PAC.               As\n\ndiscussed earlier, the school district’s “expenditure” consists of the use of personnel,\n\noffice space, computers, software, and other public resources to remit payments to the\n\nMEA-PAC. The school district is not, for example, maintaining an advertising campaign\n\non behalf of the MEA-PAC, cold-calling MEA members, or preparing mailers or\n\nbrochures to enlist contributors. As such, the school district’s use of public resources for\n\nprocessing payments to the MEA-PAC cannot be viewed as soliciting contributions, but\n\nonly as facilitating such contributions, an entirely distinct concept.      It follows that\n\nbecause the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan does not fall\n\nwithin any of the three enumerated exclusions set forth in MCL 169.206(2)(c), it is not\n\nexcluded from the definition of an “expenditure.”9\n\n\n\n9\n  Even assuming arguendo that the school district’s administration of the payroll\ndeduction plan constitutes “an expenditure for the establishment, administration, or\nsolicitation of contributions to a separate segregated fund or independent committee,”\nwhich we believe it plainly does not, by its terms, the exclusion only applies to\n“expenditure,” and not to “contribution.”\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                     C. RELEVANCE OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS\n\n       Having determined that the school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan that remits payments to the MEA-PAC constitutes both a “contribution”\n\nand an “expenditure,” the question remains whether the MEA’s preparedness to pay in\n\nadvance the school district’s costs associated with the plan remedies what would\n\notherwise constitute a violation of § 57. I do not believe that it does.\n\n       The Court of Appeals, in my judgment, correctly held that there is “nothing in the\n\nplain language of the MCFA that indicates reimbursement negates something that\n\notherwise constitutes an expenditure.” Mich Ed Ass’n, 280 Mich App at 486.

The Legislature\n\ndeclined to provide that advance payments remedy what would otherwise constitute a\n\nviolation of § 57.\n\n       The suggestion that advance payments remedy a violation of § 57 is belied by the\n\nterms of the statute. Section 57 provides that “[a] public body . . . shall not use or\n\nauthorize the use” of public resources to make a “contribution or expenditure . . . .”\n\nMCL 169.257(1) (emphasis added). The use of “shall” in a statute generally “indicates a\n\nmandatory and imperative directive.” Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848675\"><a href=\"/opinion/848675/burton-v-reed-city-hosp-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n752; 691 NW2d 424 (2005) (citations omitted). As such, the statute mandates that the\n\n\n                                             16\n\fschool district not “use or authorize the use of” its public resources to make a\n\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” Nothing in MCFA leads to the conclusion that the\n\nLegislature intended § 57 to be interpreted any differently. Irrespective of whether the\n\nschool district is reimbursed for its administration of the payroll deduction plan, the\n\nschool district nonetheless has employed public resources to make a “contribution or\n\nexpenditure” for political purposes.10 The advance payment of expenses simply does not\n\nnegate what § 57 is intended to prohibit. That is, the gravamen of § 57 is not that a\n\n“public body,” whose resources have been employed for private political purposes be\n\ncompensated on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but that public resources not be used for such\n\npurposes in the first place. That the costs of dismantling the wall separating government\n\nand partisan political campaigning are to be paid by those who desire to use taxpayer\n\nresources for their own campaigning is not the point of § 57; rather, it is that the wall not\n\nbe dismantled.11\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Moreover, the advance payment of the school district’s expenses in administering the\ndeduction plan does not avoid the question of the extent to which an exchange of\nsomething of “ascertainable monetary value” has taken place. Where the school district\nhas provided a service “at cost” to the MEA-PAC, even though the “ascertainable\nmonetary value” of that service to the MEA-PAC exceeds that cost, as it almost always\nwill in an economy in which service providers typically seek to profit from their services,\nfurther inquiry would be necessary concerning the specific terms of the school district-\npolitical action committee transaction, even if such a transaction were permissible in the\nfirst place under § 57.\n11\n  If the MEA-PAC is allowed to commandeer the resources of a “public body” simply by\nreimbursing its costs, there is nothing that would prevent the political action committee of\nany corporation from demanding or receiving the same treatment.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f        Furthermore, the unquantifiable cost to the school district, as well as to taxpayers,\n\nparents, and students, of having time and resources diverted from the school district’s\n\nprimary responsibilities of administering schools and educating students in order to\n\nadminister a process of raising political contributions for the MEA-PAC cannot simply be\n\npaid in advance or reimbursed. Time is a zero-sum resource, and it is irretrievably lost to\n\ntaxpayers, parents, and students when it is taken away from the former responsibilities\n\nand redirected to the latter responsibilities. If some lesser portion of each day is devoted\n\nto the interests of the school district and a greater portion of each day is devoted to the\n\npartisan political interests of a labor organization, taxpayers, parents, and students suffer.\n\nAlthough advance payment may recompense the school district its employees’ salaries\n\nfor the time spent on administration of the plan and for the use of supplies and other\n\npublic resources, monetary reimbursement, paid in advance or otherwise, is simply\n\ninsufficient to recover the time that is diverted from the primary obligations of the school\n\ndistrict.\n\n        Moreover, because neither advance payments nor reimbursements prevent the\n\nprohibited “use” of public resources from occurring in the first place, the act is\n\npunishable as a misdemeanor and subject to a fine that may be “equal to the amount of\n\nthe improper contribution or expenditure.” MCL 169.257(2)(b). The fact that one of the\n\npenalties for making an improper “contribution or expenditure” requires the violator to\n\npay an amount that is “equal to the amount of the improper contribution or expenditure”\n\nindicates strongly that such a payment, whether in the form of a “penalty” or a\n\n“reimbursement,” does not transform an improper “contribution or expenditure” into a\n\nproper one. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, the misdemeanor statute would\n\n\n                                             18\n\fmore likely have read that the criminal sanction to be paid is “equal to the amount of the\n\nimproper contribution or expenditure, less any reimbursement of such contribution or\n\nexpenditure.”12\n\n                                V. RESPONSE TO MAJORITY\n\n       As discussed previously, I believe that the majority errs by holding that a school\n\ndistrict’s administration of the payroll deduction plan is excluded from the definition of\n\nan “expenditure” under MCL 169.206(2)(c) because a “public body,” such as a school\n\ndistrict, is not authorized to create a separate segregated fund under MCFA and,\n\n\n12\n   The MEA also argues with regard to reimbursements that since the school district is\nreimbursed all costs and expenses, its administration of the deduction plan does not\namount to a “contribution or expenditure” because a “contribution” does not encompass\n“[a]n offer or tender of a contribution if expressly and unconditionally rejected, returned,\nor refunded in whole or in part within 30 business days after receipt,” MCL\n169.204(3)(c), and an “expenditure” does not include “[a]n offer or tender of an\nexpenditure if expressly and unconditionally rejected or returned,” MCL 169.206(2)(e).\nHowever, this argument clearly lacks merit because the MEA-PAC’s offer to reimburse\nexpenses can hardly be said to constitute a “rejection, return, or refund” of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure.” When the school district collects and remits\npayments from MEA members to the MEA-PAC, it makes an “offer or tender” of a\n“contribution or expenditure.” To qualify for the “offer or tender” exception, the MEA-\nPAC would have to unconditionally “reject or return” the services of the school district,\nsomething which it neither does nor has any intention of doing. Because the school\ndistrict’s services are unconditionally accepted by the MEA-PAC, the school district’s\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan is not excluded from the definition of a\n“contribution” or an “expenditure” under either section of MCFA. Finally, the obvious\nshould be observed, to wit, although the Legislature excluded from the definitions of\n“contribution” and “expenditure” “an offer or tender” of a “contribution or expenditure”\nthat has been rejected, returned, or refunded, there is no similar exclusion for\n“reimbursements,” an exclusion that should be thought to have been obvious, if intended.\nThe majority nonetheless intuits from the “reject or return” exception that “contribution”\nin MCL 169.204(1), “clearly requires . . . a net transfer of value.” Ante at 17. (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\ftherefore, may not rely on the § 6(2)(c) exclusion from the definition of an “expenditure.”\n\nEven if a “public body” is entitled to rely on this exclusion, the majority errs by holding\n\nthat the school district’s administration of the payroll deduction plan falls “within the\n\nstatutory exception” because the “expenditure” cannot be characterized as “[a]n\n\nexpenditure for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions to a\n\nseparate segregated fund or independent committee.” As also discussed, I believe that\n\nthe majority errs by holding that a school district’s administration of the payroll\n\ndeduction plan does not constitute a “contribution.” This latter aspect of the majority’s\n\nopinion warrants brief further discussion.\n\n       (a) In circular fashion, the majority holds that the definition of “contribution”\n\nencompasses the term “expenditure” and, thus, because the school district’s\n\nadministration of the payroll deduction plan does not constitute an “expenditure,” it also\n\ncannot be a “contribution.” The majority then states that “[t]he only other way that the\n\nadministration of the system could be a ‘contribution’ under the MCFA would be if\n\nadministering the system resulted in a ‘transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary\n\nvalue . . . .’” Ante at 14. This assertion is erroneous. As discussed earlier, an “in-kind\n\ncontribution,” which is a “contribution . . . other than money,” also constitutes a\n\n“contribution.”   MCL 169.209(3).      Similarly, MCFA defines as a “contribution” a\n\n“payment.” MCL 169.204(1). The school district arguably makes a “payment” to the\n\nMEA-PAC when it transfers money from participating MEA members to the MEA-PAC.\n\nAlthough in these circumstances the school district only acts as a conduit, a\n\n“contribution” made at the direction of another person “shall be regarded as an\n\nexpenditure or contribution attributable to both persons . . . .” MCL 169.270.\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       (b) The majority further errs by concluding that its interpretation is necessary to\n\navoid absurd results. In discussing whether the administration of the payroll deduction\n\nplan constitutes a “transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value” and thus a\n\n“contribution,” the majority states:\n\n              There are two competing ways in which to interpret the word\n       “transfer” in the statute. The first way to read the statute would require that\n       any conveyance of value for services provided to a campaign, regardless of\n       whether the services are paid for, would constitute a contribution. The\n       second way to read the statute would require a net conveyance of value in\n       order to be a “transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value.”\n\n               We conclude that the statute must be read to require a net\n       conveyance of monetary value, as opposed to a mere exchange of value.\n       Any other interpretation of “contribution” would lead to an absurd result,\n       and statutes must be construed to prevent absurd results. For example, if\n       the statute were to be interpreted in the manner the Secretary of State\n       suggests, then a print shop that sells signage to a campaign in the normal\n       course of business would be making a contribution to the campaign because\n       it has transferred something of monetary value to the campaign, even\n       though the shop has been compensated for the cost of providing the\n       signage. Such an interpretation of “contribution” would defy common\n       sense, and we do not read the statute in this manner. [Ante at 15-16\n       (citations omitted).]\nBy emphasizing that its interpretation is necessary to avoid “absurd results,” the majority\n\nitself appears to concede that the more natural interpretation of the law is that asserted by\n\nthis dissent. Resort to “absurd results” analysis is generally necessary only to avoid an\n\ninterpretation that would otherwise flow from a statute by the application of traditional\n\nprinciples of interpretation.\n\n       In essence, the majority believes that it is necessary to read MCL 169.204(1) as if\n\nit referred to a “net transfer of anything of ascertainable monetary value,” which it does\n\nnot, in order to avoid the allegedly “absurd result” to which our interpretation of MCL\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f169.204(1) would lead.

MCL 408.477(1) provides in full:\n\n                Except for those deductions required or expressly permitted by law\n         or by a collective bargaining agreement, an employer shall not deduct from\n         the wages of an employee, directly or indirectly, any amount including an\n         employee contribution to a separate segregated fund established by a\n         corporation or labor organization under section 55 of the Michigan\n         campaign finance act, Act No. 388 of the Public Acts of 1976, being\n         section 169.255 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, without the full, free, and\n         written consent of the employee, obtained without intimidation or fear of\n         discharge for refusal to permit the deduction.[14]\n\n\n\n\n14\n     See also MCL 169.255(6).\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fFrom this statute, the majority summarily concludes that, “under the plain language of\n\nMCL 408.477, public bodies have the authority to administer a payroll deduction plan\n\nthat contributes money to the MEA-PAC if the MEA enters into a collective bargaining\n\nagreement that expressly permits the deductions.” Ante at 18 n 29. Once again, the\n\nmajority has grossly misinterpreted a statute. MCL 408.477 has absolutely nothing to do\n\nwith whether a “public body” may administer a payroll deduction plan for the benefit of\n\nthe MEA-PAC. Rather, the statute describes the approval required for an employer to\n\ndeduct a portion of an employee’s wages and states that in order to deduct wages from an\n\nemployee, an employer must obtain the employee’s voluntary consent. The statute also\n\nprovides that such consent is not required when the wage deduction is expressly\n\npermitted by law or by a collective bargaining agreement.              The most that can be\n\ndiscerned from this statute as it pertains to the instant case is that, if the school district is\n\nto deduct wages from its employees, it must obtain the employees’ voluntary consent\n\nunless the deduction is expressly permitted by law or a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nHowever, neither MCL 408.477 nor any other statute provides authority for a “public\n\nbody” to administer a payroll deduction plan that contributes money to a political action\n\ncommittee. Therefore, even if the school district’s administration of a payroll deduction\n\nplan did not constitute a “contribution” or an “expenditure,” which it clearly does, in my\n\njudgment, the school district still lacks the authority to administer such a plan because no\n\nstatute accords the school district this authority, and the school district only has the\n\nauthority accorded to it by statute. Indeed, as explained earlier, the Legislature has\n\naffirmatively and expressly forbidden a school district, or any other public body, from\n\nmaking a “contribution or expenditure” to a political action committee.\n\n\n                                               24\n\f                           VI. TREATMENT OF THIS CASE\n\n       Particularly striking in its resolution of this case has been the majority’s\n\nunprecedentedly dilatory treatment, followed abruptly by its unprecedentedly accelerated\n\ntreatment. The Court of Appeals issued its decision on August 28, 2008; this Court\n\nentered an order scheduling oral argument on the application for leave to appeal more\n\nthan eight months later on May 8, 2009; oral arguments were heard six months later on\n\nNovember 5, 2009; and leave to appeal was granted seven months later on June 4, 2010.\n\nWhen leave to appeal was granted, the majority justified this on the grounds that the\n\nCourt needed to be informed about the impact of Citizens United v Fed Election Comm,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The three\n\ndissenting justices in the instant case, who also dissented from the earlier grant of leave,\n\ndescribed the complete lack of relevance of Citizens, asserting in pertinent part:\n\n             Unlike Citizens United, the issues in this case have nothing to do\n       with corporate free speech, nothing to do with labor union free speech,\n       nothing to do with the Federal Election Campaign Act, nothing to do with\n       Federal Election Commission rules or regulations, and indeed nothing to do\n       with campaign speech or the First Amendment. In short, it has nothing to\n       do with anything involved in Citizens United. Instead, it involves only\n       whether § 57 of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act bars a school district\n       from administering a payroll deduction plan for a political action\n       committee.\n\n              Indeed, neither party itself has suggested that this case is affected in\n       any way by Citizens United, nor sought any opportunity to file a\n       supplemental brief. Yet suddenly it is necessary that this Court delay\n       resolution of this case for what will be a minimum of seven or eight\n       additional months, on top of the six or seven months that have already\n       passed since oral argument. I am aware of no previous instance in which\n       this Court has held arguments on an application, taken no action in\n       response to such arguments for more than six months, and then granted\n\n\n                                             25\n\f      leave to appeal late during that term, ensuring that such case will not be\n      further considered during that term and that a decision will not be\n      forthcoming until, at the earliest, the beginning of the second calendar year,\n      2011, after arguments were initially heard. This, with regard to a case that\n      may affect the administrative processes of every school district across this\n      state.\n\n             This Court has been presented with substantial briefs from each\n      party. Each party has filed an original and supplemental brief, four amicus\n      briefs have been filed, and oral argument has taken place that lasted well\n      beyond the normal time allotted for such argument. We have heard from\n      the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Michigan AFL-CIO, the\n      Chamber of Commerce, the Michigan State Employee’s Association, and\n      the Mackinac Center, with a supplemental brief filed by the AFL-CIO and\n      two supplemental briefs filed by the Chamber of Commerce. This case\n      involves a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation, and no justice\n      has identified to any of the parties at oral argument, or at any later juncture,\n      any aspect of this case that has not been thoroughly addressed.\n\n             To grant leave to appeal under these circumstances constitutes an\n      utter waste of judicial resources, imposes an altogether unnecessary\n      expense upon the parties, and unconscionably delays resolution of an\n      important dispute of statewide importance for no proper reason. What\n      accounts for, and justifies, this delay? What is taking place here is an abuse\n      of the judicial process, and the majority owes considerably more\n      explanation for its actions than it has given. [Id. at 953 (MARKMAN, J.,\n      dissenting).]\nThe majority now summarily states in is opinion:\n\n             We note that because the issues presented in this case can be\n      resolved under Michigan law, we do not opine on the application of United\n      States Supreme Court caselaw. [Ante at 6 n 8.][15]\n\n\n\n\n15\n  Of course, whether “the issues presented in this case can be resolved under Michigan\nlaw” is irrelevant to whether United States Supreme Court caselaw interpreting the\nUnited States Constitution applies in any given case.\n\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fThe absence of any conceivable relevance of Citizens United underscores our concern\n\nthat the grant of leave to appeal in this case, following the argument on the application,\n\nrepresented a waste of judicial resources that imposed unnecessary expenses on the\n\nparties, while delaying resolution of an important dispute of statewide importance.\n\nIndeed, even before we heard oral arguments on the application, the United States\n\nSupreme Court specifically upheld Idaho’s absolute ban on the administration of payroll\n\ndeduction plans by public bodies to facilitate employee contributions to political action\n\ncommittees.

This rule created\n\n      an alternative procedure in those cases in which a majority of the Court\n      believes that an error or an injustice will result from a lower court decision,\n      yet in which there is not a sufficiently far-reaching or difficult legal issue to\n      warrant using the Court’s limited resources for full oral argument. [See\n      MCR 7.302, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">cxlvi</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (MARKMAN, J., concurring).]\n\nSince the inception of this rule, we have directed the clerk of the Court to schedule\n\narguments on whether to grant applications for leave in 280 cases. Of those cases, only\n\n14, including the instant case, resulted in a grant of the application. Of these 14 cases,\n\nnone involved a delay between argument on the application and the grant of leave\n\napproaching that involved in this case. Arguments here, which had already been delayed\n\nby more than eight months on the application, were followed by an additional seven-\n\nmonth delay before the application was even granted. Of the other 13 cases that followed\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fthe same double-hearing procedure, not a single one took seven months between the time\n\nof arguments on the application and the grant of leave; indeed, in a majority of those\n\ncases, the time elapsed was less than one month.\n\n       After granting leave to appeal, this Court again heard oral arguments in November\n\nof this year, the period for dissenting justices to respond to the majority opinion was then\n\ncompressed, and the majority has now, in December, issued an opinion in what\n\napproaches, if not exceeds, record time for the issuance of a major opinion of this Court.\n\nThe majority owes the parties and the public an explanation for their treatment of a case\n\nwhose resolution is so critical to maintaining the integrity of the governmental processes\n\nof our state.\n\n                                   VII. CONCLUSION\n\n       Section 57 prohibits a “public body” from using public resources to make a\n\n“contribution or expenditure” for political purposes. The school district’s administration\n\nof the payroll deduction plan in this case, remitting payments to the MEA-PAC,\n\nconstitutes both a “contribution” and an “expenditure” as defined by MCFA. The MEA-\n\nPAC’s offer to reimburse the school district for expenses incurred in its administration of\n\nthe plan does not remedy an otherwise clear violation of § 57. The majority’s contrary\n\ninterpretation undermines the objectives of the Legislature, which enacted § 57 to\n\nmandate the separation of the government from politics in order to maintain\n\ngovernmental neutrality in elections, preserve fair democratic processes, and prevent\n\ntaxpayer funds from being used to subsidize partisan political activities. The payroll\n\ndeduction plan in this case is inconsistent with this legislative purpose and inconsistent\n\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fwith the language of the law. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of\n\nAppeals.\n\n                                                    Stephen J.
