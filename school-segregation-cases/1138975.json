NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\n\n       These interlocutory appeals present several issues concerning the\n\ndefense of qualified immunity in the aftermath of the events of 9/11.\n\nSeveral current and former government officials from the Department of\n\nJustice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and the Bureau\n\nof Prisons (“BOP”) appeal from the September 27, 2005, Order of the\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York (John Gleeson,\n\nDistrict Judge) denying in part their motions to dismiss on the ground\n\nof qualified immunity. See Elmaghraby v. Ashcroft, No. 04 CV 1409,\n\n2005   WL   2375202   (E.D.N.Y.   Sept.    27,   2005)   (“Dist.   Ct.   op.”).\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee Javaid Iqbal alleges that the Defendants-Appellants\n\ntook a series of unconstitutional actions against him in connection\n\nwith his confinement under harsh conditions at the Metropolitan\n\nDetention Center (“MDC”) in Brooklyn, after separation from the\n\ngeneral prison population. We conclude that the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity, to the extent rejected by the District Court, cannot be\n\nsustained as to any Defendants at this preliminary stage of the\n\nlitigation except as to the claim of violation of procedural due\n\nprocess rights, and we therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and\n\nremand.\n\n                                  Background\n\n       Parties. Iqbal is a Muslim Pakistani currently residing in\n\n                                     -3-\n\fPakistan.       Iqbal’s   co-plaintiff   was   Ehad   Elmaghraby,   a   Muslim\n\nEgyptian. After Judge Gleeson’s ruling on the motions to dismiss, the\n\nUnited States settled Elmaghraby’s claims by payment of $300,000.\n\n     Four groups of Defendants have filed appeals from Judge Gleeson’s\n\norder.      The first group consists of former Attorney General John\n\nAshcroft and current FBI Director Robert Mueller.          The second group\n\nconsists of Michael Rolince, former Chief of the FBI’s International\n\nTerrorism Operations Section, Counterterrorism Division, and Kenneth\n\nMaxwell, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s New\n\nYork Field Office (the “FBI Defendants”). The third group consists of\n\nformer BOP officials: Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, former BOP Director; David\n\nRardin, former Director of the Northeast Region of the Bureau of\n\nPrisons;     and   Michael   Cooksey,    former   Assistant   Director     for\n\nCorrectional Programs of the Bureau of Prisons (the “BOP Defendants”).\n\nThe fourth appeal was filed by Dennis Hasty, former MDC Warden. Other\n\nDefendants include Michael Zenk, MDC Warden at the time the lawsuit\n\nwas filed, other MDC staff, and the United States.\n\n     Factual allegations. The complaint alleges the following facts,\n\nwhich are assumed to be true for purposes of the pending appeals, as\n\nwe are required to do in reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss.\n\nSee Hill v. City of New York, 45 F.3d 653, 657 (2d Cir. 1995).             The\n\nPlaintiff was arrested by agents of the FBI and the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service on November 2, 2001.1 Following his arrest, he\n\n     1\n         The complaint does not identify the charges on which Iqbal was\n\narrested, but Judge Gleeson’s opinion states that he was charged with\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwas detained in the MDC’s general prison population until January 8,\n\n2002, when he was removed from the general prison population and\n\nassigned to a special section of the MDC known as the Administrative\n\nMaximum Special Housing Unit (“ADMAX SHU”), where he remained until he\n\nwas reassigned to the general prison population at the end of July\n\n2002.      On this appeal, we consider only claims concerning the\n\nPlaintiff’s      separation    from   the      general   prison   population   and\n\nconfinement thereafter in the ADMAX SHU.                 We do not consider the\n\nlegality of his arrest or his initial detention in the MDC.\n\n     The complaint further alleges that in the months after 9/11, the\n\nFBI arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its\n\ninvestigation into the events of 9/11.            The fact of their detention,\n\nits duration, and the conditions of confinement depended on whether\n\nthose arrested were classified as “of high interest.”               Many of these\n\nmen, including the Plaintiff, were classified as “of high interest”\n\nsolely because of their race,2 religion, and national origin and not\n\n\nconspiracy to defraud the United States and fraud with identification.\n\nDist. Ct. op. at *1 n.1.\n     2\n         Iqbal   is   a   Muslim   and   a     Pakistani,   but   not   an   Arab.\n\nNevertheless, his claim is fairly to be understood as alleging\n\nunlawful treatment based on his ethnicity, even if not technically on\n\na racial classification. And his allegations of what was done to Arab\n\nMuslims are fairly understood to mean that unlawful actions were taken\n\nagainst him because officials believed, perhaps because of his\n\nappearance and his ethnicity, that he was an Arab.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fbecause of any involvement in terrorism.       In the New York City area,\n\nall Arab Muslim men arrested on criminal or immigration charges while\n\nthe FBI was investigating a 9/11 lead were classified as “of high\n\ninterest.     The FBI Defendants were responsible for making these\n\nclassifications for detainees arrested in the New York City area,\n\nincluding the Plaintiff.\n\n      The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft and Mueller approved\n\na policy of holding detainees “of high interest” in highly restrictive\n\nconditions until they were “cleared” by the FBI.          In early October,\n\nBOP Defendant Cooksey, with the knowledge of BOP Defendant Sawyer,\n\ndirected that all detainees “of high interest” be held in the most\n\nrestrictive conditions possible.       FBI officials were aware that the\n\nBOP   was   relying   on   this   classification    to   hold   detainees    in\n\nrestrictive conditions.\n\n      The complaint further alleges that soon after 9/11, the MDC\n\ncreated within the MDC an ADMAX SHU, the BOP’s most restrictive type\n\nof confinement, to house the detainees “of high interest.”                  The\n\nprocedures for handling ADMAX SHU detainees were developed by MDC\n\nstaff, at the request of Defendant Hasty.          ADMAX SHU detainees were\n\npermitted to leave their cells only one hour each day, and all legal\n\nand social interactions were non-contact.           Movement outside their\n\ncells required handcuffs and leg irons and four-officer escorts.\n\nMovement inside their cells was monitored by video cameras. For many\n\nweeks, the detainees were subject to a communications blackout.\n\n      The complaint further alleges that the MDC did not conduct any\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\freview of the detainees’ segregation in the ADMAX SHU.          Instead, the\n\ndetainees remained in the ADMAX SHU until the FBI approved their\n\nrelease to the general population.       As a result, numerous detainees\n\nwere held in the ADMAX SHU for extended periods of time even though\n\nthere was no evidence linking them to terrorism.\n\n     The complaint further alleges that the Plaintiff was transferred\n\nto the ADMAX SHU on January 8, 2002.             He was kept in solitary\n\nconfinement.   Until March, the lights in his cell were left on almost\n\n24 hours a day, and MDC staff deliberately turned on air conditioning\n\nduring the winter and heating during the summer. MDC staff left the\n\nPlaintiff in the open-air recreation area for hours when it was\n\nraining and then turned on the air conditioner when he returned to his\n\ncell.   Whenever the Plaintiff was removed from his cell, he was\n\nhandcuffed and shackled. The Plaintiff was not provided with adequate\n\nfood and lost 40 pounds while in custody. MDC staff called him, among\n\nother things, a “terrorist” and a “Muslim killer.”\n\n     The complaint further alleges that the Plaintiff was brutally\n\nbeaten by MDC guards on two occasions: upon his transfer to the ADMAX\n\nSHU in January 2002 and again in March.        Following the March beating,\n\nthe Plaintiff was denied medical care for two weeks even though he was\n\nin excruciating pain.     He was also subjected to daily strip and body-\n\ncavity searches.    The March beating was prompted by the Plaintiff’s\n\nprotestations to a fourth consecutive strip and body-cavity search in\n\nthe same room.     MDC staff interfered with the Plaintiff’s prayers,\n\nroutinely   confiscated   his   Koran,   and   refused   to   permit   him   to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fparticipate in Friday prayer services. They also interfered with the\n\nPlaintiff’s communications with his defense attorney, for example, by\n\ndisconnecting       the   phone    if    the   Plaintiff     complained      about   his\n\nconditions of confinement and delaying his receipt of legal mail for\n\nup to two months.\n\n     The Plaintiff pled guilty on April 22, 2002, and was sentenced on\n\nSeptember 17, 2002.       He was released from the ADMAX SHU at the end of\n\nJuly 2002, after pleading guilty but before sentencing. Judge Gleeson\n\nconsidered the Plaintiff to be a pretrial detainee throughout his\n\nentire time in the ADMAX SHU. Dist. Ct. op. at *15 n.14.                             The\n\nPlaintiff     was   released      from   the     MDC   on   January    15,   2003,   and\n\nthereafter was removed to Pakistan (a fact not in the complaint but\n\nundisputed).\n\n     Litigation in the District Court.                 The Plaintiff (and his co-\n\nplaintiff) commenced this action in May 2004.                         Their complaint\n\nasserted twenty-one causes of action, including both statutory claims\n\nand constitutional tort claims pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\nAgents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).                          The\n\ncauses of action, and the Defendants against whom they were asserted,\n\nare set forth in the margin.3\n\n     3\n         The claims, in the order set forth in the complaint, are:\n\n\n\n     1.

In addition, the United States moved to be substituted as\n\nthe defendant on the ATCA claim (Count 21) and for dismissal of that\n\nclaim.\n\n     With a few exceptions, Judge Gleeson denied the motions to\n\ndismiss.       He   first    rejected   Ashcroft’s   argument   that   “special\n\nfactors,” namely the post-9/11 context, precluded a Bivens action in\n\nthis case. See Dist. Ct. op. at *14. Judge Gleeson then turned to the\n\nsubstance of the Plaintiff’s Bivens claims. He denied Hasty’s motion\n\nto dismiss the conditions of confinement claims (Counts One and\n\nEight), concluding that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged (1)\n\nillegitimate reasons for the conditions of his confinement and (2)\n\nHasty’s personal involvement. See id. at *15-*17.               He also found\n\n\n     21.            Alien Tort Claims Act (“ATCA”) claim: Ashcroft and\n\n                    Mueller, FBI Defendants, BOP Defendants, Hasty, and MDC\n\n                    staff.\n     4\n         Zenk, the MDC Warden at the time the lawsuit was filed, and the\n\nMDC medical assistant are not appealing Judge Gleeson’s ruling.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fadequate allegations of Hasty’s personal involvement in the claims of\n\nexcessive force (Counts Three and Four), interference with the\n\nPlaintiff’s right to counsel (Count Five), unreasonable strip searches\n\n(Count Nine), and interference with the Plaintiff’s exercise of\n\nreligion (Count Ten). See id. at *22, *27, *28. However, he found the\n\nallegations insufficient to support the personal involvement of BOP\n\nDefendant Sawyer in the unreasonable strip searches and dismissed this\n\nclaim against her. See id. at *27.\n\n     With respect to the procedural due process claim (Count Two),\n\nJudge Gleeson found that the Plaintiff had alleged both a deprivation\n\nof a liberty interest that involved “atypical and significant”\n\nhardships compared to the conditions in the general prison population\n\nand the absence of any due process protections, that the Plaintiff’s\n\nright was clearly established, and that he could not assess the\n\nobjective reasonableness of the Defendants’ actions as a matter of law\n\nat this stage of the litigation. See id. at *18-*20.         He also found\n\nthat the Plaintiff had adequately alleged the personal involvement of\n\nall the Defendants, observing that “the post-September 11 context\n\nprovide[d]    support   for   [the    P]laintiffs’   assertions   that   [the\n\nD]efendants    were   involved   in   creating   and/or   implementing    the\n\ndetention policy under which [the P]laintiffs were confined without\n\ndue process.” See id. at *20-*21.            Finally, with respect to the\n\nprocedural due process claim, he limited the first stage of discovery\n\nto the issue of the Defendants’ personal involvement in the alleged\n\ndenial of due process. See id. at *21.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f     With respect to the Plaintiff’s Bivens claims of race and\n\nreligious discrimination (Counts 11 and 12), Judge Gleeson ruled that\n\nthe Plaintiff’s allegations that he was confined in significantly\n\nharsher conditions solely because of his race and religion were\n\nsufficient to state a cause of action. See id. at *29.            He also\n\nconcluded that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged the personal\n\ninvolvement of Ashcroft and Mueller, the FBI Defendants, and Hasty.\n\nSee id.   However, because the Plaintiff had not alleged that the BOP\n\nDefendants were involved in the challenged classification in any way,\n\nJudge Gleeson concluded that the Plaintiff had not alleged the\n\npersonal involvement of the BOP Defendants, and he dismissed these\n\nclaims against them. See id.\n\n     Turning to the Plaintiff’s statutory claims, Judge Gleeson\n\ndismissed the RFRA claims against all the Defendants, concluding that\n\nthey were entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly\n\nestablished that RFRA applied to federal government officials. See id.\n\nat *30-*31.    He also dismissed the ATCA claim after first having\n\nsubstituted the United States for the individual defendants. See id.\n\nat *34-*35.   Finally, he denied the motions to dismiss the section\n\n1985(3) conspiracy claims, rejecting the Defendants’ arguments that it\n\nwas not clearly established that section 1985 applied to federal\n\nofficers and concluding that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged the\n\nDefendants’   personal   involvement,   except   with   respect   to   the\n\nallegation that the BOP Defendants had conspired to subject the\n\nPlaintiff to unreasonable strip searches. See id. at *32-*33.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                                   Discussion\n\n     The Defendants appeal from the District Court’s order denying\n\ntheir motions to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity.                        Their\n\narguments with respect to qualified immunity fall into several broad\n\ncategories:   (1)   the    Plaintiff’s       allegations     do     not    allege      the\n\nviolation of a clearly established right, (2) do not allege sufficient\n\npersonal involvement of the Defendants in the challenged actions, (3)\n\nare too conclusory to overcome a qualified immunity defense, and (4)\n\nthe Defendants’ actions were objectively reasonable.                    Permeating the\n\nDefendants’    assertion     of    a   qualified    immunity        defense      is    the\n\ncontention that, however the defense might be adjudicated in normal\n\ncircumstances, the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack created a\n\ncontext in which the defense must be assessed differently and, from\n\ntheir standpoint, favorably.\n\n     In addition, Ashcroft, Mueller, and FBI Defendant Rolince seek\n\nreview of the denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction, arguing that the issue of personal jurisdiction is\n\navailable for review on this interlocutory appeal because the issue is\n\ninextricably intertwined with that of qualified immunity.\n\n     Because many of the Defendants’ grounds for asserting an immunity\n\ndefense   overlap   with     respect        to   several    of    the      Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations, it will be convenient to consider separately each of the\n\nPlaintiff’s   causes    of   action     with     respect    to    the     one   or    more\n\nDefendants    against     whom    it   is   asserted,      rather       than    consider\n\nseparately the claims asserted against each Defendant. Before turning\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fto each of the Plaintiff’s allegations, we first consider the legal\n\nstandards that apply to nearly all of the Plaintiff’s claims and to\n\nmost of the grounds on which the Defendants assert their qualified\n\nimmunity defense.\n\nI. General Principles of Qualified Immunity\n\n     (a) Standard of review.   When a district court denies qualified\n\nimmunity on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “we review the district\n\ncourt’s denial de novo, accepting as true the material facts alleged\n\nin the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’\n\nfavor.” Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged School District, 239 F.3d 246,\n\n250 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n     (b) Appealability.    A district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity is appealable as a collateral order if it turns on an issue\n\nof law. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985).     Thus, a\n\ndefendant may appeal a district court’s ruling denying qualified\n\nimmunity when, if a plaintiff’s allegations are assumed to be true,\n\nthe only question is whether the alleged conduct violated a clearly\n\nestablished right. See Locurto v. Safir, 264 F.3d 154, 163 (2d Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n     (c) The qualified immunity defense.      Qualified immunity is an\n\nimmunity from suit and not just a defense to liability. See Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001).         The first step in a qualified\n\nimmunity inquiry is to determine whether the alleged facts demonstrate\n\nthat a defendant violated a constitutional right. See id. at 201; see\n\nalso Scott v. Harris, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 1774 & n.4 (2007).      If the\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fallegations show that a defendant violated a constitutional right, the\n\nnext step is to determine whether that right was clearly established\n\nat the time of the challenged action--that is, “whether it would be\n\nclear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the\n\nsituation he confronted.” See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.                 A defendant\n\nwill be entitled to qualified immunity if either (1) his actions did\n\nnot    violate   clearly    established   law   or   (2)   it   was     objectively\n\nreasonable for him to believe that his actions did not violate clearly\n\nestablished law. See Johnson, 239 F.3d at 250.\n\n       In determining whether a right was clearly established, the court\n\nmust assess whether “the contours of the right [were] sufficiently\n\nclear in the context of the alleged violation such that a reasonable\n\nofficial would understand that what he [was] doing violate[d] that\n\nright.” Id. at 250-51 (internal quotation marks omitted).                  To that\n\nend, the court should consider what a reasonable officer in the\n\ndefendant’s position would have known about the lawfulness of his\n\nconduct, “not what a lawyer would learn or intuit from researching\n\ncase    law.”    Id.   at    251   (internal    quotation       marks     omitted).\n\nFurthermore, the court need not identify “legal precedent addressing\n\nan identical factual scenario” to conclude that the right is clearly\n\nestablished. Id.; see also Tellier v. Fields, 280 F.3d 69, 84 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (noting that a law is “clearly established” so long as a ruling\n\non the issue is “clearly foreshadow[ed]” by this Circuit’s decisions).\n\n       (d) Personal involvement. Many of the Defendants claim qualified\n\nimmunity on the ground that the Plaintiff has failed to allege their\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fpersonal involvement in the challenged actions. All of the appealing\n\nDefendants are supervisory officials.                   The personal involvement of a\n\nsupervisor     may     be    established        by    showing    that   he    (1)    directly\n\nparticipated in the violation, (2) failed to remedy the violation\n\nafter being informed of it by report or appeal, (3) created a policy\n\nor   custom    under    which    the    violation        occurred,      (4)    was    grossly\n\nnegligent in supervising subordinates who committed the violation, or\n\n(5) was deliberately indifferent to the rights of others by failing to\n\nact on information that constitutional rights were being violated. See\n\nColon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995) (discussing section\n\n1983 liability).\n\n      Although a lack of personal involvement may be grounds for\n\ndismissing a claim on the merits (a ruling that would not be subject\n\nto an interlocutory appeal), such a lack is also relevant to a defense\n\nof qualified immunity because it goes to the question of whether a\n\ndefendant’s        actions    violated      a    clearly    established        right.      See\n\nMcCullough v. Wyandanch Union Free School District, 187 F.3d 272, 280\n\n(2d Cir. 1999) (“Where there is a total absence of evidence of [a\n\nviolation], there is no basis on which to conclude that the defendant\n\nseeking    qualified         immunity    violated        clearly    established        law.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).                     “[O]ur task is to consider\n\nwhether,      as   a   matter   of   law,       the    factual    allegations        and   all\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom are insufficient to establish the\n\nrequired showing of personal involvement.” Johnson, 239 F.3d at 255.\n\n      (e) Pleading requirements.                The parties dispute the extent to\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\fwhich a plaintiff must plead specific facts to overcome a defense of\n\nqualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage.        Although most of\n\nthe Defendants disclaim requiring the Plaintiff to meet a heightened\n\npleading standard, beyond the requirement of Conley v. Gibson, 355\n\nU.S. 41, 47 (1957), that a complaint “give the defendant fair notice\n\nof what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,”\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), all the Defendants make the somewhat\n\nsimilar argument that “conclusory allegations” will not suffice to\n\nwithstand a qualified immunity defense, especially with respect to\n\nallegations    of   supervisory   involvement,   racial   and/or   religious\n\nanimus, or conspiracy.     BOP Defendant Cooksey explicitly urges us to\n\nadopt a heightened pleading standard in Bivens actions.\n\n     The pleading standard to overcome a qualified immunity defense\n\nappears to be an unsettled question in this Circuit.          Four Supreme\n\nCourt opinions provide guidance, although the guidance they provide is\n\nnot readily harmonized.      In Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\n\nIntelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993), the Court\n\nrejected a heightened pleading standard in a civil rights action\n\nalleging municipal liability, applying instead only the traditional\n\nrequirement of “‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that\n\nthe pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. at 168 (quoting Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8(a)(2)).    In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguished\n\nbetween municipalities’ immunity from respondeat superior liability\n\nand government officials’ qualified immunity from suit. See id. at\n\n166. Arguably, this distinction could permit requiring a plaintiff to\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fsatisfy a heightened pleading standard of a cause of action in order\n\nto overcome a government official’s defense of qualified immunity.\n\nHowever, the Court’s opinion in Leatherman suggests that heightened\n\npleading standards are never permissible except when authorized by\n\nRule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See id. at 168\n\n(noting that Rule 9(b) “do[es] not include among the enumerated\n\nactions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability under\n\n§ 1983\").      Indeed, the Court observed that, in the absence of\n\namendment to Rules 8 or 9, the courts could rely only on control of\n\ndiscovery and summary judgment to “weed out unmeritorious claims.” Id.\n\nat 168-69.\n\n     A more pertinent precedent is Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534\n\nU.S. 506 (2002), which concerned the adequacy of pleading a Title VII\n\ncomplaint.     The Court rejected what had been this Circuit’s rule\n\nrequiring    employment   discrimination   plaintiffs   to   allege   facts\n\nconstituting a prima facie case of employment discrimination. See id.\n\nat 515.      The Court again emphasized that the judicially imposed\n\nheightened pleading standard conflicted with Rule 8(a) and that a\n\nheightened pleading standard could be attained only “by the process of\n\namending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Leatherman and especially Swierkiewicz–-with their insistence\n\nthat courts cannot impose heightened pleading standards in the absence\n\nof statutory authorization--indicate that a court cannot impose a\n\nheightened pleading standard in Bivens (or other civil rights) actions\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fagainst individual officials, a precept we have heeded since the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Swierkiewicz.     See, e.g., Phillip v.\n\nUniversity of Rochester, 316 F.3d 291, 298-99 (2d Cir. 2003) (general\n\nallegation of racial animus); Phelps v. Kapnolas, 308 F.3d 180, 186-87\n\n(2d Cir. 2002) (general allegation of knowledge).\n\n     However, a third Supreme Court case, decided between Leatherman\n\nand Swierkiewicz, cryptically suggests that, in some circumstances, a\n\ncourt could require “specific nonconclusory factual allegations” at\n\nthe pleading stage in claims against government officials.         In\n\nCrawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574 (1998), the D.C. Circuit had\n\nrecognized a heightened burden of proof in cases against government\n\nofficials alleging unconstitutional motive. See id. at 582-83.    The\n\nCourt observed that the D.C. Circuit had adopted the heightened\n\nstandard in an attempt “to address a potentially serious problem:\n\nBecause an official’s state of mind is easy to allege and hard to\n\ndisprove, insubstantial claims that turn on improper intent may be\n\nless amenable to summary disposition than other types of claims\n\nagainst government officials.” Id. at 584-85 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   Although the Supreme Court recognized this problem, it\n\nrejected the heightened standard of proof.\n\n     The Court held that the D.C. Circuit’s rule was not compelled by\n\neither the holding or the reasoning of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n\n800 (1982). In Harlow, the Court had stated that “bare allegations of\n\nmalice should not suffice to subject government officials either to\n\nthe costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.” Id.\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fat 817-18.     However, as the Court explained in Crawford-El, this\n\nstatement merely concerned a plaintiff’s attempt to        overcome a\n\nlegitimate qualified immunity defense by alleging malicious intent;\n\nthis holding was irrelevant to a plaintiff’s burden in alleging a\n\nconstitutional violation of which improper motive is an essential\n\nelement. See 523 U.S. at 588-89.        Neither did Harlow’s reasoning\n\nrequire a heightened burden of proof: the Court observed that there\n\nexisted other mechanisms for protecting officials from unmeritorious\n\nactions, such as the requirement that the officials’ conduct violate\n\nclearly established law, the need to prove causation, and procedural\n\nprotections.    See id. at 590-93.\n\n     The Court acknowledged that the usual pleading standard would\n\nsometimes not preclude at least limited discovery to amplify general\n\nallegations.   The Court observed that Harlow only “sought to protect\n\nofficials from the costs of ‘broad-reaching’ discovery” and that\n\nlimited discovery is sometimes necessary to adjudicate a qualified\n\nimmunity defense. See id. at 593 n.14.         The Court concluded by\n\nobserving that “broad discretion” in the discovery process is more\n\n“useful and equitable” than categorical rules such as that of the D.C.\n\nCircuit. See id. at 601.\n\n     What Crawford-El gave civil rights plaintiffs with respect to\n\ntraditional notice pleading, however, it might have modified by\n\npermitting some post-complaint detailing of a claim.     In discussing\n\nthe procedural mechanisms available to judges in civil rights actions,\n\nat least those alleging wrongful motive, the Court observed that,\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fbefore permitting discovery, a court could require a plaintiff to “put\n\nforward specific, non-conclusory factual allegations that establish\n\nimproper motive causing cognizable injury in order to survive a\n\nprediscovery motion for dismissal or summary judgment.” Id. at 598\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps significantly, the Court\n\nquoted    the   phrase   “put    forward    specific,   nonconclusory   factual\n\nallegations” from Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion in Siegert v.\n\nGilley, 500 U.S. 226 (1991), in which he had explicitly advocated a\n\nheightened pleading standard for civil rights actions requiring a\n\nshowing of malice. See id. at 235-36 (“There is tension between the\n\nrationale of Harlow and the requirement of malice, and it seems to me\n\nthat the heightened pleading requirement is the most workable means to\n\nresolve it.”).\n\n     The First Circuit has remarked that “[w]hatever                 window of\n\nopportunity [it] thought remained open after Crawford-El has been\n\nslammed    shut   by     the    Supreme     Court’s   subsequent   decision   in\n\nSwierkiewicz.” Educadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernandez, 367\n\nF.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir. 2004).        Most Circuits appear to have rejected a\n\nheightened pleading standard. See Doe v. Cassel, 403 F.3d 986, 988-89\n\n& n.3 (8th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases); Galbraith v. County of Santa\n\nClara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir. 2002) (same).\n\n     Considerable uncertainty concerning the standard for assessing\n\nthe adequacy of pleadings has recently been created by the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955\n\n(2007).    If we were to consider only a narrow view of the holding of\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fthat decision, we would not make any adjustment in our view of the\n\napplicable pleading standard.   Bell Atlantic held that an allegation\n\nof parallel conduct by competitors, without more, does not suffice to\n\nplead an antitrust violation under 15 U.S.C. § 1. See id. at 1961.\n\nThe Court required, in addition, “enough factual matter (taken as\n\ntrue) to suggest that an agreement was made.” Id. at 1965.   However,\n\nthe Court’s explanation for its holding indicated that it intended to\n\nmake some alteration in the regime of pure notice pleading that had\n\nprevailed in the federal courts ever since Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S.\n\n41 (1957), was decided half a century ago.   The nature and extent of\n\nthat alteration is not clear because the Court’s explanation contains\n\nseveral, not entirely consistent, signals, which we consider (not\n\nnecessarily in the order set forth in the Court’s opinion).\n\n     Some of these signals point toward a new and heightened pleading\n\nstandard.   First, the Court explicitly disavowed the oft-quoted\n\nstatement in Conley of “‘the accepted rule that a complaint should not\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his\n\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.’” Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct.\n\nat 1968 (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46).    Bell Atlantic asserted\n\nthat this “no set of facts” language “has earned retirement” and “is\n\nbest forgotten.” Id. at 1969.\n\n     Second, the Court, using a variety of phrases, indicated that\n\nmore than notice of a claim is needed to allege a section 1 violation\n\nbased on competitors’ parallel conduct.        For example, the Court\n\n\n                                -23-\n\frequired “enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an\n\nagreement was made,” id. at 1965; “enough fact to raise a reasonable\n\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement,”\n\nid.; “facts that are suggestive enough to render a § 1 conspiracy\n\nplausible,” id.; “allegations of parallel conduct . . . placed in a\n\ncontext that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement,” id. at\n\n1966; “allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)\n\nagreement,” id.; a “plain statement” (as specified in Rule 8(a)(2))\n\nwith “enough heft” to show entitlement to relief, id.; and “enough\n\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” id.\n\nat 1974, and also stated that the line “between the factually neutral\n\nand the factually suggestive. . . must be crossed to enter the realm\n\nof plausible liability,” id. at 1966 n.5., and that “the complaint\n\nwarranted dismissal because it failed in toto to render plaintiffs’\n\nentitlement to relief plausible,” id. at 1973 n.14.\n\n     Third, the Court discounted the ability of “‘careful        case\n\nmanagement,’” “to weed[] out early in the discovery process” “a claim\n\njust shy of a plausible entitlement.” Id. at 1967 (quoting id. at 1975\n\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)).\n\n     Fourth, the Court encapsulated its various formulations of what\n\nis required into what it labeled “the plausibility standard.” Id. at\n\n1968. Indeed, the Court used the word “plausibility” or an adjectival\n\nor adverbial form of the word fifteen times (not counting quotations).\n\n     On the other hand, some of the Court’s linguistic signals point\n\naway from a heightened pleading standard and suggest that whatever the\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fCourt is requiring in Bell Atlantic might be limited to, or at least\n\napplied most rigorously in, the context of either all section 1\n\nallegations or perhaps only those section 1 allegations relying on\n\ncompetitors’ parallel conduct. First, the Court explicitly disclaimed\n\nthat it was “requir[ing] heightened fact pleading of specifics,” id.\n\nat 1974, and emphasized the continued viability of Swierkiewicz, see\n\nid. at 1973-74, which had rejected a heightened pleading standard.\n\nSee also Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007) (citing Bell\n\nAtlantic’s citation of Swierkiewicz).\n\n     Second, although the Court faulted the plaintiffs’ complaint for\n\nalleging “merely legal conclusions” of conspiracy, id. at 1970, it\n\nexplicitly noted with approval Form 9 of the Federal Civil Rules,\n\nComplaint for Negligence, which, with respect to the ground of\n\nliability, alleges only that the defendant “negligently drove a motor\n\nvehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing [an identified]\n\nhighway,” Fed. R. Civ. P. App. Form 9. See Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct.\n\nat 1970 n.10.   The Court noted that Form 9 specifies the particular\n\nhighway the plaintiff was crossing and the date and time of the\n\naccident, see id., but took no notice of the total lack of an\n\nallegation of the respects in which the defendant is alleged to have\n\nbeen negligent, i.e., driving too fast, crossing the center line,\n\nrunning a traffic light or stop sign, or even generally failing to\n\nmaintain a proper lookout.   The adequacy of a generalized allegation\n\nof negligence in the approved Form 9 seems to weigh heavily against\n\nreading Bell Atlantic to condemn the insufficiency of all legal\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fconclusions in a pleading, as long as the defendant is given notice of\n\nthe date, time, and place where the legally vulnerable conduct\n\noccurred.\n\n     Third, the Court placed heavy emphasis on the “sprawling, costly,\n\nand hugely time-consuming” discovery that would ensue in permitting a\n\nbare allegation of an antitrust conspiracy to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss, see id. at 1967 n.6, and expressed concern that such\n\ndiscovery “will push cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic\n\ncases,” id. at 1967. These concerns provide some basis for believing\n\nthat whatever adjustment in pleading standards results from Bell\n\nAtlantic is limited to cases where massive discovery is likely to\n\ncreate unacceptable settlement pressures.\n\n     Fourth, although the Court expressed doubts about the ability of\n\ndistrict courts to “weed[] out” through case management in the\n\ndiscovery process “a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to\n\nrelief,” id. (emphasis added), the Court did not disclaim its prior\n\nstatement that “federal courts and litigants must rely on summary\n\njudgment and control of discovery to weed out unmeritorious claims\n\nsooner rather than later.” Leatherman, 507 U.S. at 168-69 (emphasis\n\nadded).5 Leaving Leatherman and Crawford-El undisturbed (compared to\n\nthe explicit disavowal of the “no set of facts” language of Conley)\n\nfurther suggests that Bell Atlantic, or at least its full force, is\n\n     5\n         There   is   no   possibility   that   the   “weed   out”   language   of\n\nLeatherman was overlooked; it was called to the Court’s attention in\n\nJustice Stevens’s dissent. See Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1982.\n\n                                         -26-\n\flimited to the antitrust context.\n\n     Fifth, just two weeks after issuing its opinion in Bell Atlantic,\n\nthe Court cited it for the traditional proposition that “[s]pecific\n\nfacts are not necessary [for a pleading that satisfies Rule 8(a)(2)];\n\nthe statement need only ‘”give the defendant fair notice of what the\n\n. . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”’ Erickson, 127 S.\n\nCt. at 2200 (quoting Bell Atlantic’s quotation from Conley) (omission\n\nin original).\n\n     These conflicting signals create some uncertainty as to the\n\nintended scope of the Court’s decision.6     We are reluctant to assume\n\nthat all of the language of Bell Atlantic applies only to section 1\n\nallegations based on competitors’ parallel conduct or, slightly more\n\nbroadly, only to antitrust cases.7       Some of the language relating\n\n     6\n         The parties, not surprisingly, view Bell Atlantic entirely\n\ndifferently.      Defendant Hasty characterizes the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision as a “sea change” in the pleading standard of Rule 8, see\n\nLetter from Michael L. Martinez, counsel for Defendant Hasty, to the\n\nActing Clerk of this Court (May 25, 2007); the Plaintiff emphasizes\n\nthe antitrust holding of the decision, see Letter from Alexander A.\n\nReinert, counsel for Plaintiff Iqbal, to the Acting Clerk of this\n\nCourt (May 22, 2007).\n     7\n         For example, it would be cavalier to believe that the Court’s\n\nrejection of the “no set of facts” language from Conley, which has\n\nbeen cited by federal courts at least 10,000 times in a wide variety\n\nof contexts (according to a Westlaw search), applies only to section\n\n                                  -27-\n\fgenerally to Rule 8 pleading standards seems to be so integral to the\n\nrationale of the Court’s parallel conduct holding as to constitute a\n\nnecessary part of that holding.          See Pierre N. Leval, Judging under\n\nthe Constitution: Dicta about Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249, 1257\n\n(2006)    (“The    distinction    [between     holding   and    dictum]      requires\n\nrecognition of what was the question before the court upon which the\n\njudgment depended, how (and by what reasoning) the court resolved the\n\nquestion, and what role, if any, the proposition played in the\n\nreasoning that led to the judgment.”).\n\n     After careful consideration of the Court’s opinion and the\n\nconflicting signals from it that we have identified, we believe the\n\nCourt is not requiring a universal standard of heightened fact\n\npleading, but is instead requiring a flexible “plausibility standard,”\n\nwhich    obliges    a   pleader   to   amplify   a   claim     with   some    factual\n\nallegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to\n\nrender the claim plausible.        We will say more about this approach as\n\nwe apply it below to some of the Plaintiff’s specific allegations.\n\n     Notwithstanding what we understand to be the essential message of\n\nBell Atlantic, we acknowledge that we see some merit in the argument\n\nin favor of a heightened pleading standard in this case for two\n\nreasons.    First, qualified immunity is a privilege that is essential\n\nto the ability of government officials to carry out their public roles\n\neffectively without fear of undue harassment by litigation.                   In this\n\nrespect, the factors favoring a heightened pleading standard to\n\n\n1 antitrust claims.\n\n                                        -28-\n\fovercome a qualified immunity defense are distinguishable from the\n\npurely prudential and policy-driven factors that the Supreme Court\n\nfound inadequate to justify a heightened pleading standard in the\n\nTitle VII context. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 514-15.\n\n     Second, some of the allegations in the Plaintiff’s complaint,\n\nalthough not entirely conclusory, suggest that some of the Plaintiff’s\n\nclaims are based not on facts supporting the claim but, rather, on\n\ngeneralized   allegations    of   supervisory    involvement.    Therefore,\n\nallowing some of the Plaintiff’s claims to survive a motion to dismiss\n\nmight   facilitate   the   very   type   of   broad-ranging   discovery   and\n\nlitigation burdens that the qualified immunity privilege was intended\n\nto prevent.\n\n     Nevertheless, although Swierkiewicz was decided in the context of\n\nTitle VII, we are mindful of the Supreme Court’s statement in that\n\ndecision that heightened pleading requirements “must be attained by\n\nthe process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial\n\ninterpretation.” Id. at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAbsent any indication from the Supreme Court that qualified immunity\n\nmight warrant an exception to this general approach and the explicit\n\ndisclaimer of a heightened pleading standard in Bell Atlantic,\n\nreinforced by the reversal of the Tenth Circuit’s use of a heightened\n\npleading standard in Erickson, we conclude that a heightened pleading\n\nrule may not be imposed.      However, in order to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss under the plausibility standard of Bell Atlantic, a conclusory\n\nallegation concerning some elements of a plaintiff’s claims might need\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fto be fleshed out by a plaintiff’s response to a defendant’s motion\n\nfor a more definite statement. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).                      In\n\naddition, even though a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a\n\ndistrict court, while mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of\n\nthe qualified immunity defense by dismissing non-meritorious claims\n\nagainst   public    officials   at   an   early    stage   of   litigation,   may\n\nnonetheless consider exercising its discretion to permit some limited\n\nand tightly controlled reciprocal discovery so that a defendant may\n\nprobe for amplification of a plaintiff’s claims and a plaintiff may\n\nprobe such matters as a defendant’s knowledge of relevant facts and\n\npersonal involvement in challenged conduct.           In a case such as this\n\nwhere some of the defendants are current or former senior officials of\n\nthe Government, against whom broad-ranging allegations of knowledge\n\nand personal involvement are easily made, a district court might wish\n\nto structure such limited discovery by examining written responses to\n\ninterrogatories and requests to admit before authorizing depositions,\n\nand by deferring discovery directed to high-level officials until\n\ndiscovery   of     front-line   officials    has    been   completed   and    has\n\ndemonstrated the need for discovery higher up the ranks. If discovery\n\ndirected to current or former senior officials becomes warranted, a\n\ndistrict court might also consider making all such discovery subject\n\nto prior court approval.\n\n     We note that Rule 8(a)’s liberal pleading requirement, when\n\napplied mechanically without countervailing discovery safeguards,\n\nthreatens to create a dilemma between adhering to the Federal Rules\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fand abiding by the principle that qualified immunity is an immunity\n\nfrom suit as well as from liability. Therefore, we emphasize that, as\n\nthe claims surviving this ruling are litigated on remand, the District\n\nCourt not only may, but “must exercise its discretion in a way that\n\nprotects the substance of the qualified immunity defense . . . so that\n\nofficials [or former officials] are not subjected to unnecessary and\n\nburdensome discovery or trial proceedings.” Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at\n\n597-98 (emphasis added). In addition, the District Court should\n\nprovide ample opportunity for the Defendants to seek summary judgment\n\nif, after carefully targeted discovery, the evidence indicates that\n\ncertain of the Defendants were not sufficiently involved in the\n\nalleged violations to support a finding of personal liability, or that\n\nno constitutional violation took place. See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 821\n\n(Brennan, J., concurring) (“[S]ummary judgment will also be readily\n\navailable whenever the plaintiff cannot prove, as a threshold matter,\n\nthat a violation of his constitutional rights actually occurred.”).\n\nWe give these matters additional consideration below with respect to\n\nparticular claims.\n\n     (f) The post-9/11 context. Several Defendants contend that even\n\nif the Plaintiff’s complaint would survive a motion to dismiss in the\n\nface of a qualified immunity defense under normal circumstances, the\n\npost-9/11 context requires a different outcome.     This argument is\n\nadvanced on three fronts.   First, some Defendants contend that the\n\nGovernment was entitled to take certain actions that might not have\n\nbeen lawful before 9/11 because the Government’s interests assumed\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fspecial weight in the post-9/11 context. Second, some Defendants\n\ncontend that, even if the law was clearly established as to the\n\nexistence of a right claimed to have been violated, it was not clearly\n\nestablished in the extraordinary circumstances of the 9/11 attack and\n\nits aftermath.   Third, some Defendants contend that the post-9/11\n\ncontext renders their actions objectively reasonable, an argument we\n\ndo not reach in view of our disposition of their second contention.\n\n     We fully recognize the gravity of the situation that confronted\n\ninvestigative officials of the United States as a consequence of the\n\n9/11 attack. We also recognize that some forms of governmental action\n\nare permitted in emergency situations that would exceed constitutional\n\nlimits in normal times. See Home Building & Loan Association v.\n\nBlaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 425-26 (1934) (“While emergency does not\n\ncreate power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of\n\npower.”).   But most of the rights that the Plaintiff contends were\n\nviolated do not vary with surrounding circumstances, such as the right\n\nnot to be subjected to needlessly harsh conditions of confinement, the\n\nright to be free from the use of excessive force, and the right not to\n\nbe subjected to ethnic or religious discrimination.   The strength of\n\nour system of constitutional    rights derives from the steadfast\n\nprotection of those rights in both normal and unusual times.\n\n     With some rights, for example, the right to be free from\n\nunreasonable searches, the existence of exigent circumstances might\n\njustify governmental action that would not otherwise be permitted.\n\nSee, e.g., Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499, 509 (1978) (exigent\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fcircumstances permitted warrantless entry into home).              But, as we\n\ndiscuss below, see Part VI, the exigent circumstances of the post-9/11\n\ncontext do not diminish the Plaintiff’s right not to be needlessly\n\nharassed and mistreated in the confines of a prison cell by repeated\n\nstrip and body-cavity searches.       This and other rights, such as the\n\nright to be free from use of excessive force and not to be subjected\n\nto ethnic or religious discrimination, were all clearly established\n\nprior to 9/11, and they remained clearly established even in the\n\naftermath   of   that   horrific   event.      To   whatever   extent   exigent\n\ncircumstances might affect the lawfulness of the Defendants’ actions\n\nor might have justified an objectively reasonable belief that their\n\nactions did not violate clearly established law, we consider the\n\nargument in connection with a particular claim.\n\n     With these general principles in mind, we turn to the Plaintiff’s\n\nspecific claims.\n\nII. Procedural Due Process\n\n     The    Plaintiff   alleges    that   Ashcroft    and   Mueller,    the   FBI\n\nDefendants, the BOP Defendants, and Hasty adopted a policy under which\n\nhe was deprived of a liberty interest without any of the procedural\n\nprotections required by due process of law.            His allegation of the\n\ndeprivation of a liberty interest, even while lawfully confined\n\nwithout bail on criminal charges, is based on his placement in\n\nsolitary confinement, where he was subjected to needlessly harsh\n\nrestrictions that were atypical and significant when compared to those\n\nin the rest of the MDC population.          The Defendants contend that (1)\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fthe Plaintiff did not allege that the confinement was punitive; (2) no\n\nprocedural due process right was violated because the Plaintiff did\n\nnot have a liberty interest in avoiding extended confinement in the\n\nADMAX SHU and, even if he did, he received all the process that was\n\ndue; (3) even if the Plaintiff’s procedural due process right was\n\nviolated, the contours of this right were not clearly established at\n\nthe time of the events in question; (4) the Defendants’ actions were\n\nobjectively reasonable in the post-9/11 context; and (5) the Plaintiff\n\nhas failed to allege personal involvement.\n\n     We are required by the Supreme Court’s decision in Saucier to\n\nassess these arguments within a two-part framework, asking first\n\nwhether the alleged facts show a violation of a constitutional right,\n\nsee Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, and, if so, “whether the right was\n\nclearly established . . . in light of the specific context of the\n\ncase,” see id. The first, second, and fifth of the Defendants’\n\narguments bear on the initial issue of whether a violation has been\n\nalleged;   the   third   argument--whether   the   right   was   clearly\n\nestablished--is precisely the second issue under Saucier; and the\n\nfourth argument is often a further component of a qualified immunity\n\ndefense because even if the law was clearly established, it might have\n\nbeen objectively reasonable, on the facts of a particular case, for a\n\ndefendant to believe that the actions taken did not violate that\n\nestablished law, see Johnson, 239 F.3d at 250.\n\n     (a) Has a Violation of a Procedural Due Process Right Been\n\nAdequately Pleaded?\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f     In assessing the adequacy of the Plaintiff’s pleading of a\n\nprocedural due process violation we first consider the basic question\n\nof whether the Plaintiff has pleaded the existence of a liberty\n\ninterest and entitlement to procedures that were not provided and then\n\nconsider the Defendants’ arguments that punitive intent and personal\n\ninvolvement were not adequately pleaded.\n\n     (i) The Plaintiff’s procedural due process right. In concluding\n\nthat the Plaintiff had a protected liberty interest, Judge Gleeson\n\nrelied on this Court’s decision in Tellier v. Fields, 280 F.3d 69 (2d\n\nCir. 2000). See Dist. Ct. op. at *17-*18.          In Tellier, a federal\n\ninmate allegedly was placed in administrative detention in the SHU for\n\nmore than 500 days without being informed of the reasons for his\n\nplacement or receiving any hearings. See 280 F.3d at 74.              The\n\nregulations governing administrative segregation, 28 C.F.R. § 541.22,\n\nentitle inmates to “an administrative detention order detailing the\n\nreasons for placing an inmate in administrative detention . . .\n\nprovided institutional security is not compromised thereby.” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 541.22(b).    Moreover, the regulations require a Segregation Review\n\nOfficer to “hold a hearing and formally review the status of each\n\ninmate who spends seven continuous days in administrative detention,\n\nand thereafter . . . hold a hearing and review these cases formally at\n\nleast   every   30   days.”   Id.   §   541.22(c)(1).   The   regulations\n\nspecifically provide that administrative detention “is to be used only\n\nfor short periods of time except . . . where there are exceptional\n\ncircumstances, ordinarily tied to security or complex investigative\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fconcerns.” Id.\n\n     In assessing whether a prisoner had a protected liberty interest\n\nin avoiding administrative segregation, Tellier looked to Sandin v.\n\nConner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), in which the Supreme Court held that\n\nstate-created liberty interests of prisoners were limited to freedom\n\nfrom restraint that “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\n\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id. at\n\n483-84.   Since Sandin, the rule in this Circuit has been that a\n\nprisoner has a protected liberty interest “‘only if the deprivation\n\n. . . is atypical and significant and the state has created the\n\nliberty interest by statute or regulation.’” Tellier, 280 F.3d at 80\n\n(quoting Sealey v. Giltner, 116 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 1997)) (omission\n\nin original); see also Palmer v. Richards, 364 F.3d 60, 64 & n.2 (2d\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n     Numerous cases in this Circuit have discussed the “atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship” prong of Sandin. Relevant factors include both\n\nthe conditions of segregation and its duration. See Palmer, 364 F.3d\n\nat 64. Segregation of longer than 305 days in standard SHU conditions\n\nis sufficiently atypical to require procedural due process protection\n\nunder Sandin. See id. at 65 (citing Colon v. Howard, 215 F.3d 227, 231\n\n(2d Cir. 2000)).    When confinement is of an intermediate duration--\n\nbetween 101 and 305 days--“‘development of a detailed record’ of the\n\nconditions of the confinement relative to ordinary prison conditions\n\nis required.” Id. at 64-65 (quoting Colon, 215 F.3d at 232).\n\n     Applying    these   standards,    Tellier   first   observed   that   the\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fprisoner   had    alleged   confinement        of   more   than    500   days   “under\n\nconditions that differ markedly from those in the general population,”\n\nfinding    this    sufficient     to    allege      “atypical     and    significant”\n\nhardships.   280    F.3d    at    80.    Turning      to   the    language      of   the\n\nregulations, the Court agreed that because the initial decision to\n\nplace a prisoner in administrative detention is a discretionary one,\n\nthe plaintiff did not have a “protected liberty interest that is\n\nviolated   when    the   Warden    removes     him    or   her    from   the    general\n\npopulation.” Id. at 82.          However, the Court found, the regulations\n\nconstrain the warden’s discretion in maintaining a prisoner in\n\ndetention and the procedures “are designed to ensure that a prisoner\n\nis kept in SHU for no longer than is necessary.” Id. at 82-83.\n\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that section 541.22 “creates a\n\nprotectable liberty interest when an official’s failure to adhere to\n\nthe [regulation] results in an atypical, significant deprivation.” Id.\n\nat 83 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Relying on Tellier, Judge Gleeson concluded that the Plaintiff\n\nhad a clearly established protectable liberty interest in avoiding\n\ncontinued detention in the ADMAX SHU. See Dist. Ct. op. at *18.                       On\n\nappeal, the Defendants contend that Tellier is no longer good law in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Wilkinson v. Austin,\n\n545 U.S. 209 (2005).         In Wilkinson, the Supreme Court considered\n\nSandin’s application to segregation in Ohio’s Supermax facility.\n\nInmates in the Supermax facility were detained in solitary confinement\n\nindefinitely, they remained in their cells 23 hours a day, the lights\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fwere turned on constantly, they could not go outside for recreation,\n\nand they were limited to non-contact visits. See id. at 214-15.   The\n\nCourt confirmed Sandin’s holding that “a liberty interest in avoiding\n\nparticular conditions of confinement may arise from state policies or\n\nregulations, subject to the important     limitations set forth in\n\nSandin,” id. at 222, but observed that “the touchstone of the inquiry\n\ninto the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in\n\navoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of\n\nregulations regarding those conditions    but the nature of those\n\nconditions themselves in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison\n\nlife,” id. at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted).      The Court\n\nrecognized that the courts of appeals had struggled to identify a\n\nbaseline for determining what constitutes an atypical and significant\n\nhardship, but it concluded that confinement in the Supermax facility\n\n“imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible\n\nbaseline.” Id. Having found that the prisoner had a protected liberty\n\ninterest, the Court concluded that Ohio’s “informal, nonadversary\n\nprocedures” were sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. Id.\n\nat 228-29.\n\n     The Defendants argue that Wilkinson abrogates Tellier or that it\n\nat least renders the relevant standard unclear because it instructs\n\ncourts to consider the nature of the conditions, not the requirements\n\nof the regulations.    We disagree for two reasons.     First, while\n\nWilkinson instructs courts to focus on the nature of the conditions,\n\nit nonetheless explains that the “liberty interest in avoiding\n\n\n                                -38-\n\fparticular conditions of confinement . . . arise[s] from state\n\npolicies or regulations.” Id. at 222.              Following Tellier, Judge\n\nGleeson looked to the duration and conditions of confinement, as\n\ninstructed by Wilkinson. See Dist. Ct. op. at *18.\n\n     Second, and more significantly, for at least half (if not all) of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s confinement in the ADMAX SHU, he was a pretrial\n\ndetainee, not a convicted prisoner.8          This Court has said that Sandin\n\n     8\n         The   Defendants   do   not   seriously   contest   Judge   Gleeson’s\n\ncharacterization of the Plaintiff as a pretrial detainee, although\n\nAshcroft and Mueller briefly contend that his private interest in\n\navoiding detention in the ADMAX SHU after he pled guilty should be\n\nevaluated “within the context of the prison system,” i.e., under\n\nEighth Amendment standards.        The Plaintiff argues that he should be\n\ntreated as a pretrial detainee until he was sentenced, citing Fuentes\n\nv. Wagner, 206 F.3d 335, 341 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n     The circuits are divided as to whether to treat convicted, but\n\nunsentenced, inmates as pretrial detainees.          Compare id. (treated as\n\npretrial detainee) with Resnick v. Hayes, 213 F.3d 443, 448 (9th Cir.\n\n2000) (treated as prisoner), Whitnack v. Douglas County, 16 F.3d 954,\n\n956-57 (8th Cir. 1994) (same), and Berry v. City of Muskogee, 900 F.2d\n\n1489, 1493 (10th Cir. 1990) (same).           Because none of the Defendants\n\nseriously challenges Judge Gleeson’s characterization of the Plaintiff\n\nas a pretrial detainee throughout his entire confinement in the ADMAX\n\nSHU, we will refer to him as a pretrial detainee, a status that\n\n                                       -39-\n\fdoes not apply to pretrial detainees and that, accordingly, pretrial\n\ndetainees need not show that an imposed restraint imposes atypical and\n\nsignificant hardships to state deprivation of a liberty interest\n\nprotected by procedural due process. See Benjamin v. Fraser, 264 F.3d\n\n175, 188-89 (2d Cir. 2001) (“Benjamin I”).   In Benjamin I, this Court\n\naffirmed the district court’s ruling that the imposition of painful\n\nphysical restraints during the movement of pretrial detainees required\n\n“reasonable after-the-fact procedural protections to ensure that such\n\nrestrictions on liberty [would] be terminated reasonably soon if they\n\n[had] no justification.” Id. at 188.\n\n     In sum, Wilkinson does not affect the validity of Judge Gleeson’s\n\nruling that the Plaintiff had a protected liberty interest because (1)\n\nhe considered the Plaintiff’s allegations of atypical and significant\n\nhardships and (2) the Wilkinson and Sandin analysis does not apply to\n\nthe interval of the Plaintiff’s pretrial detention.        Under this\n\nCourt’s case law, the Plaintiff’s confinement of more than six months\n\nfell in the intermediate range, thereby requiring inquiry into the\n\nconditions of his confinement, which he sufficiently alleges to have\n\nbeen severe.   Even under Wilkinson, the conditions under which the\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he was confined--solitary confinement, repeated\n\n\nplainly applies during the several months of confinement prior to the\n\nPlaintiff’s plea.    We do not consider the question of whether\n\nconvicted, but unsentenced, inmates are pretrial detainees under the\n\nSupreme Court’s jurisprudence establishing criteria for evaluating\n\nconstitutional limits on conditions of confinement.\n\n                                -40-\n\fstrip and body-cavity searches, beatings, exposure to excessive heat\n\nand cold, very limited exercise, and almost constant lighting--as well\n\nas the initially indefinite duration of confinement could be found to\n\nconstitute atypical and significant hardships. See 545 U.S. at 223-24.\n\nThe Plaintiff has alleged a protected liberty interest in avoiding\n\nmore than six months’ detention in the ADMAX SHU, especially in light\n\nof his status as a pretrial detainee.\n\n       The Defendants also dispute the violation of a procedural due\n\nprocess right by arguing that, even if the Plaintiff had a protected\n\nliberty interest in avoiding extended detention in the ADMAX SHU, he\n\nreceived all the process that was due by virtue of the FBI’s review.\n\nThis    argument   is   unavailing   at   this    preliminary      stage   of    the\n\nlitigation.     In Wilkinson, the Supreme Court applied the familiar\n\nbalancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), to\n\ndetermine     whether   the   plaintiff     received     adequate     procedural\n\nprotections. See 545 U.S. at 224-25.        Under the second prong of this\n\ntest, the Court observed that inmates received “notice of the factual\n\nbasis    leading   to   consideration     for    OSP   placement    and    a    fair\n\nopportunity for rebuttal,” stating that “these are among the most\n\nimportant procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous\n\ndeprivations.”      Id. at 225-26.        After weighing all the relevant\n\nfactors, the Court found that “[w]here the inquiry draws more on the\n\nexperience of prison administrators, and where the State’s interest\n\nimplicates the safety of other inmates and prison personnel, . . .\n\ninformal, nonadversary procedures” were sufficient.             Id. at 228-29.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fIn the pending case, the Plaintiff alleges that he did not even\n\nreceive notice of the factual grounds on which he was being detained\n\nin the ADMAX SHU nor did he have any opportunity for rebuttal.\n\n     We recognize that in the post-9/11 context the first Mathews\n\nfactor–-the gravity of the Government’s interest–-is appropriately\n\naccorded more weight than would otherwise be warranted.      It might be\n\nthat the combination of (1) the Government’s interest, accorded added\n\nweight in the post-9/11 context, (2) the Plaintiff’s interest in\n\navoiding confinement under harsh conditions, and (3) the risk of an\n\nerroneous determination of the need for such confinement would, on\n\nbalance, lead to the conclusion that the Government need not have\n\ngiven the Plaintiff notice and a chance for rebuttal before placing\n\nhim in the ADMAX SHU.        However, once it became clear that the\n\nPlaintiff was going to be confined in the ADMAX SHU for an extended\n\nperiod of time, some process was required.        We cannot say in the\n\nabsence of a developed factual record whether the FBI’s clearance\n\nprocedure comported with the requirements of the Due Process Clause as\n\ninterpreted in Mathews and subsequent cases.     The sparse record thus\n\nfar developed provides no indication as to what security-related steps\n\nthe Defendants were taking that might justify prolonged confinement.\n\nNor does that record indicate in what respect providing the Plaintiff\n\nwith some notice of the basis for his separation in the ADMAX SHU and\n\naffording some opportunity for rebuttal would have impaired national\n\nsecurity   interests   or   legitimate   penological   interests   of   the\n\nGovernment.   The Government has not as yet had an opportunity to\n\n\n                                  -42-\n\frefute    the    Plaintiff’s    allegation    that   there    was    no    evidence\n\nconnecting him to terrorism.         Accordingly, we cannot say whether the\n\nGovernment’s     national   security    interests    rendered       the   clearance\n\nprocedure sufficient to satisfy procedural due process requirements or\n\nwhether   more    traditional    procedural      protections    were      required.\n\nNevertheless, because we are required at this stage of the litigation\n\nto accept all of the Plaintiff’s allegations as true and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in his favor, we cannot say that the Plaintiff\n\nhas failed to plead a viable claim under the procedural component of\n\nthe Due Process Clause.          Judge Gleeson dismissed the Plaintiff’s\n\nprocedural due process claim with respect to the initial confinement\n\nin the ADMAX SHU, Dist. Ct. op. at *17 n.18, but properly ruled that\n\nthe Plaintiff had stated a procedural due process claim with respect\n\nto his continued confinement, see id. at *18-*19.\n\n     (ii) Punitive intent. Ashcroft, Mueller, and Hasty, citing Bell\n\nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), contend that the Plaintiff has not\n\nstated a claim that the confinement in the ADMAX SHU violated his\n\nprocedural due process rights because he has not alleged that the\n\nconfinement was punitive.       Preliminarily, we note that the complaint\n\nalleges   that    the   Defendants    designed   a   policy    under      which   the\n\nPlaintiff was “arbitrarily designated to be confined in the ADMAX SHU”\n\nand that “[k]eeping Plaintiff[] in isolation . . . amounted to the\n\nwillful, malicious, and unnecessary infliction of pain and suffering.”\n\nThis is sufficient to allege that the confinement was punitive in\n\nnature.\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f     More     fundamentally,   however,        we   deem   unsupportable    the\n\nDefendants’ premise that the Plaintiff’s procedural due process claim\n\nrequires an allegation of punitive intent.           Defendants Ashcroft and\n\nMueller cite Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535, for the proposition that “in\n\nevaluating the constitutionality of conditions or restrictions of\n\npretrial detention, the proper inquiry under the Due Process Clause is\n\nwhether the conditions ‘amount to punishment of the detainee.’”\n\nHowever, Wolfish did not involve a claim that inadequate procedures\n\nhad been used to impose challenged conditions of confinement.               The\n\nclaim there was that the challenged conditions of confinement, being\n\npunitive, could not be imposed on pretrial detainees at all because\n\nthey had not been convicted.     Although the Court did not consider the\n\nchallenged conditions punitive, it ruled that “under the Due Process\n\nClause, a detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of\n\nguilt in accordance with due process of law.” Id.                This ruling\n\nimplements the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.9\n\n     9\n         Since Wolfish prohibited punishment prior to the process of\n\nadjudicating guilt, it could be considered a decision vindicating a\n\nprocedural claim. However, as the Supreme Court’s decisions in Wolff\n\nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460\n\n(1983), and Sandin, 515 U.S. 472, make clear, when the Court is truly\n\nconsidering a claim that restrictions were imposed within a prison\n\nwithout     adequate   procedures,   it   is    focusing   precisely   on   the\n\nprocedural requirements of the Due Process Clause, and not what in\n\nreality is the substantive component that was at issue in Wolfish.\n\n                                     -44-\n\f      By contrast, the relevant line of authority for the Plaintiff’s\n\nprocedural due process claim begins with Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S.\n\n539 (1974), and continues through Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460\n\n(1983), and Sandin, 515 U.S. 472.          Wolff outlined fairly extensive\n\nprocedures that must be observed before a prisoner’s liberty interest\n\nin   retaining   good   time   credits   could   be   impaired   because   of\n\ndisciplinary violations. 418 U.S. at 563-72.           Helms required only\n\nnotice of charges and an opportunity to rebut in order to place a\n\nprisoner in administrative segregation pending an investigation of\n\nmisconduct charges. 459 U.S. at 476.       Sandin modified Helms by making\n\nthe existence of a prisoner’s liberty interest turn primarily on the\n\natypical nature of the challenged conditions of confinement, 515 U.S.\n\nat 483-87, but did not alter the basic requirement that where a\n\nprisoner’s liberty interest exists, its impairment requires some\n\nprocedural protections.\n\n      The Plaintiff’s liberty interest, based primarily on a federal\n\nregulation, is entitled to some procedural protection regardless of\n\npunitive intent.    To the extent that the interest derives directly\n\nfrom the Due Process Clause (and hence requires procedural protection\n\nonly when punishment is imposed, see Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535), the\n\nharsh conditions set forth in the complaint adequately meet the\n\ncriteria for punishment, see Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S.\n\n\nSee Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 591 & n.12 (1984) (applying\n\nWolfish to pretrial detainees’ substantive due process claim and\n\ndistinguishing it from a procedural due process claim).\n\n                                    -45-\n\f144, 168-69 (1963), whether or not such conditions were imposed with\n\npunitive intent.\n\n     (iii) Lack of personal involvement. Defendants Ashcroft and\n\nMueller contend that the Plaintiff has not adequately alleged their\n\npersonal involvement in the denial of procedural due process because\n\nthe continued detention decision was made by       FBI subordinates.\n\nApplying the standards applicable to personal involvement outlined\n\nabove, we reject this claim at this stage of the litigation. Ashcroft\n\nand Mueller are alleged to have condoned the policy under which the\n\nPlaintiff was held in harsh conditions of confinement until “cleared”\n\nby the FBI.   Since the complaint adequately alleges, for purposes of\n\na motion to dismiss, that procedural due process required some\n\nprocedures beyond FBI clearance, the allegation of condoning the\n\npolicy of holding the Plaintiff in the ADMAX SHU until cleared\n\nsuffices, at the pleading stage, to defeat dismissal for lack of\n\npersonal involvement.\n\n     At the other end of the leadership chain, Defendant Hasty asserts\n\nhis lack of personal involvement because the continued detention\n\ndecision was made far above his level of responsibility.     But this\n\ndefense also cannot prevail at this stage of the litigation. Cf.\n\nAnthony v. City of New York, 339 F.3d 129, 138 (2d Cir. 2003)\n\n(“Plausible instructions from a superior . . . support qualified\n\nimmunity where, viewed objectively in light of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances, they could lead a reasonable officer to conclude that\n\nthe necessary legal justification for his actions exists (e.g.[,]\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\f. . . exigent circumstances).” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nHasty is alleged to have known of the continued detention in the ADMAX\n\nSHU and the absence of procedural protections for the Plaintiff.\n\nWhether his conduct as a subordinate was objectively reasonable under\n\nall the circumstances is an issue distinct from the adequacy of the\n\npleading of personal involvement.\n\n     Between these extremes in the official hierarchy, the lack of\n\nadequate allegations of personal knowledge of, or involvement in, the\n\nPlaintiff’s continued detention is also asserted by the FBI Defendants\n\nand the BOP Defendants.   However, the complaint at least implicitly\n\nalleges the knowledge of the FBI Defendants by stating that they\n\n“failed to approve post-September 11 detainees’ release to general\n\npopulation.”   With respect to the BOP Defendants, the complaint\n\nalleges that BOP Defendant Cooksey “directed that all detainees ‘of\n\nhigh interest’ be confined in the most restrictive conditions possible\n\nuntil cleared by the FBI,” that BOP Defendant Sawyer approved this\n\npolicy, and that BOP Defendant Rardin, along with others, designed the\n\npolicy of arbitrary confinement in the ADMAX SHU.   The FBI Defendants\n\nalso dispute their personal involvement in a procedural due process\n\nviolation by arguing that they could not reasonably be expected to\n\nknow about the BOP regulations. However, some factual development of\n\nthis claim would have to precede its determination.    Moreover, even\n\nabsent the FBI Defendants’ knowledge of the BOP regulation, the\n\ncomplaint can support the inference that the FBI Defendants understood\n\nthat their alleged role in the clearance procedure was linked to a\n\n\n                                -47-\n\fdetainee’s release to the general population.             This suffices to\n\novercome the defense of no personal involvement at this stage of the\n\nlitigation.\n\n       It is arguable that, under the plausibility standard of Bell\n\nAtlantic, some subsidiary facts must be alleged to plead adequately\n\nthat    Ashcroft   and    Mueller   condoned   the   Plaintiff’s   continued\n\nconfinement in the ADMAX SHU, that Hasty had knowledge of that\n\nconfinement, or that the mid-level Defendants knew the relationship\n\nbetween their clearance procedure and the Plaintiff’s release to the\n\ngeneral population.        However, all of the Plaintiff’s allegations\n\nrespecting the personal involvement of these Defendants are entirely\n\nplausible, without allegations of additional subsidiary facts.          This\n\nis clearly so with respect to Hasty and the mid-level Defendants.\n\nEven as to Ashcroft and Mueller, it is plausible to believe that\n\nsenior officials of the Department of Justice would be aware of\n\npolicies concerning       the detention of those arrested by federal\n\nofficers in the New York City area in the aftermath of 9/11 and would\n\nknow about, condone, or otherwise have personal involvement in the\n\nimplementation of those policies.           Sustaining the adequacy of a\n\npleading of personal involvement in these circumstances runs no risk\n\nthat every prisoner complaining of a denial of rights while in federal\n\ncustody anywhere in the United States can survive a motion to dismiss\n\nsimply by alleging that the Attorney General knew of or condoned the\n\nalleged violation.       And, like the Form 9 complaint approved in Bell\n\nAtlantic, Iqbal’s complaint informs all of the Defendants of the time\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fframe and place of the alleged violations.\n\n       (b) Was the Plaintiff’s Right to Procedural Due Process Clearly\n\nEstablished?\n\n       Although we conclude that the Plaintiff has adequately pleaded a\n\nviolation of a procedural due process right, we also conclude that in\n\nthis     case   “officers    of     reasonable     competence        could   [have]\n\ndisagree[d],” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986), whether\n\ntheir conduct violated a clearly established procedural due process\n\nright.    Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s right to additional procedures\n\nwas not clearly established with the level of specificity that is\n\nrequired to defeat a qualified immunity defense. See Brosseau v.\n\nHaugen, 543 U.S. 194, 199-200 (2004).\n\n       Several factors combine to create this lack of clarity in prior\n\ncase    law.    First,   some   uncertainty      exists    in   determining       when\n\nadministrative    segregation       procedures    are     required    even   in    the\n\nordinary criminal context.        Our case law would require an officer in\n\nthe Defendants’ situation to consider various factors including the\n\nlength of the Plaintiff’s confinement, the extent to which the\n\nconditions of confinement were atypical, the text of relevant BOP\n\nregulations, and the Plaintiff’s status as a pretrial detainee. See,\n\ne.g., Tellier, 280 F.3d at 79-83. As noted above, no single factor is\n\ndispositive in this case, which concerns administrative segregation of\n\napproximately six months.         Although the harshness of the conditions\n\nalleged weigh in favor of requiring procedural protections, an officer\n\ncould    reasonably   note   that    the   Plaintiff’s      six-month    continued\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\fconfinement was comparable to the duration of confinements in cases\n\nthat we characterized in Tellier as involving “relatively brief\n\nperiods of confinement.” See id. at 85.\n\n     Second, uncertainty in existing case law is heightened by the\n\nfact that, even on the facts alleged in the complaint, which specified\n\nthat the “of high interest” designation pertained to the Government’s\n\npost-9/11 terrorism investigation, the investigation leading to the\n\nPlaintiff’s separation from the general prison population could be\n\nreasonably understood by all of the Defendants to relate to matters of\n\nnational security, rather than an ordinary criminal investigation.\n\nPrior to the instant case, neither the Supreme Court nor our Court had\n\nconsidered whether the Due Process Clause requires officials to\n\nprovide   ordinary   administrative   segregation   hearings   to   persons\n\ndetained under special conditions of confinement until cleared of\n\nconnection with activities threatening national security. Cf. Forsyth,\n\n472 U.S. at 534-35 (granting Attorney General qualified immunity for\n\nwarrantless   wiretapping   for   national    security   purposes   despite\n\nprohibitions of warrantless wiretapping in criminal context).\n\n     Third, the BOP regulation on which the Plaintiff relies itself\n\ncontains potentially relevant exceptions that undermine certainty as\n\nto established requirements of law.       “Administrative detention is to\n\nbe used only for short periods of time except . . . where there are\n\nexceptional circumstances, ordinarily tied to security or complex\n\ninvestigative concerns,” 28 C.F.R. § 541.22(c)(1) (emphasis added),\n\nand inmates are entitled to “an administrative detention order\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\fdetailing     the   reasons   for   placing   an   inmate   in   administrative\n\ndetention . . . provided institutional security is not compromised\n\nthereby,” id. § 541. 22(b) (emphasis added).\n\n     In sum, these factors, taken together, would suffice to raise “a\n\nlegitimate question,” Forsyth, 472 U.S. at 535 n.12, among Government\n\nofficials as to whether the Due Process Clause required administrative\n\nsegregation hearings or any procedures other than the FBI’s clearance\n\nsystem. See id. (“[W]here there is a legitimate question whether an\n\nexception to [a constitutional requirement] exists,” failure to abide\n\nby the requirement “cannot be said [to have] violate[d] clearly\n\nestablished law.” (emphasis added)).           Accordingly, we will direct\n\ndismissal of the portions of the Plaintiff’s complaint alleging\n\nviolations of procedural due process rights. See Compl. ¶¶ 204-06.\n\nIII. Conditions of Confinement\n\n     Hasty contends that Judge Gleeson should have dismissed the\n\nPlaintiff’s conditions of confinement claims against him on the ground\n\nof qualified immunity because (1) the Plaintiff did not allege\n\nconditions amounting to a violation of substantive due process rights,\n\n(2) the Plaintiff failed to allege Hasty’s deliberate indifference to\n\nthe maintenance of the conditions of confinement, and (3) Hasty’s\n\nactions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances.10\n\n     10\n          There is some question as to whether Hasty sought to dismiss the\n\nsubstantive due process claim or the excessive force claim, see Part\n\nIV, infra, in the District Court on the ground of qualified immunity,\n\nas distinguished from the merits of the claim.         However, the District\n\n                                      -51-\n\f     Because   the   Plaintiff   was   a   pretrial   detainee   during   his\n\ndetention in the ADMAX SHU, his challenge to the conditions of his\n\nconfinement arises from the substantive component of the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment and not from the cruel and unusual\n\npunishment standards of the Eighth Amendment. See Benjamin v. Fraser,\n\n343 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir. 2003) (“Benjamin II”).         Pretrial detainees\n\nhave not been convicted of a crime and thus “may not be punished in\n\nany manner--neither cruelly and unusually nor otherwise.” Id. at 49-\n\n50. Courts considering challenges to confinement brought by pretrial\n\ndetainees must first consider whether the circumstances of the\n\nparticular confinement render the confinement punitive; since some\n\nrestraint is necessary to confine a pretrial detainee, not all\n\nuncomfortable conditions or restrictions are necessarily punitive. Id.\n\nat 50. In Bell v. Wolfish, supra, the seminal case on the substantive\n\ndue process claims of pretrial detainees, the Supreme Court recognized\n\nthe following factors as relevant to the determination of whether a\n\ncondition of confinement is punitive:\n\n     “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or\n     restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a\n     punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of\n     scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional\n     aims of punishment--retribution and deterrence, whether the\n     behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an\n     alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected\n\n\nCourt understood all the Defendants to “seek dismissal of all claims\n\nagainst them on qualified immunity grounds,” Dist. Ct. op. at *10, and\n\nwe are satisfied that we have jurisdiction of an appeal from the\n\nrulings that are premised on that understanding.\n\n                                   -52-\n\f     is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in\n     relation to the alternative purpose assigned . . . .”\n\n441 U.S. at 537-38 (quoting Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168-69).            A\n\ncourt may infer that a condition of confinement is intended as\n\npunishment if it is not reasonably related to a legitimate government\n\nobjective. See id. at 539.\n\n     The complaint alleges, among other things, that MDC staff placed\n\nthe Plaintiff in solitary confinement, deliberately subjected him to\n\nextreme hot and cold temperatures, shackled him every time he left his\n\ncell, and repeatedly subjected him to strip and body-cavity searches,\n\nand that these conditions were intended to be, and were in fact,\n\npunitive.     Applying Wolfish, Judge Gleeson found these allegations\n\nsufficient to state a substantive due process claim, observing that\n\nwhether     the   conditions   were    reasonably    related   to   legitimate\n\ngovernment objectives could not be determined on a motion to dismiss.\n\nSee Dist. Ct. op. at *16.\n\n     Hasty contends that Judge Gleeson did not properly consider\n\nwhether the Plaintiff alleged that he was “deprived of the minimal\n\ncivilized    measure   of   life’s    necessities”   or   whether   Hasty   was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to the Plaintiff’s health or safety.               But\n\nthis Court has never applied those standards in this context.                In\n\nBenjamin II, we distinguished between challenges to disabilities\n\nimposed purposefully on pretrial detainees, which are analyzed under\n\nthe Wolfish “punitive” inquiry, and pretrial detainees’ challenges to\n\nprison environmental conditions. See 343 F.3d at 50. Recognizing that\n\nthe “punitive” standard is neither required nor helpful in the context\n\n                                      -53-\n\fof environmental conditions, we adopted a modified version of the\n\nEighth Amendment’s deliberate indifference standard; we required a\n\nshowing of deliberate indifference but stated that such indifference\n\ncould be presumed from an absence of reasonable care. See id.                We\n\nexplicitly rejected analogies to the Eighth Amendment that would\n\nrequire a showing of wantonness on the part of the prison official,\n\nsee id. at 51, or a showing that the alleged conditions were so\n\ninhumane as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment, see id. at 52\n\n(citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976)).\n\n      The Plaintiff has alleged the purposeful infliction of restraints\n\nthat were punitive in nature.        Accordingly, the District Court need\n\nnot have considered whether a Defendant was “deliberately indifferent”\n\nin inflicting the restraints or whether the restraints constituted\n\ncruel and unusual punishment.       The right of pretrial detainees to be\n\nfree from punitive restraints was clearly established at the time of\n\nthe events in question, and no reasonable officer could have thought\n\nthat he could punish a pretrial detainee by subjecting him to the\n\npractices and conditions alleged by the Plaintiff.\n\n      The Plaintiff alleges that Hasty (1) requested that certain\n\nofficials develop procedures for the ADMAX SHU, (2) knew of the\n\nconditions of confinement to which Plaintiff was subjected, (3)\n\napproved the strip search policy, and (4) knew or should have known of\n\nthe practice or custom of beating detainees. Under a notice pleading\n\nstandard, reaffirmed in Bell Atlantic and Erickson, these allegations\n\nare   sufficient   to   state   a   claim   that   Hasty   failed   to   remedy\n\n\n                                     -54-\n\fconstitutional violations of which he was aware.       Moreover, the\n\ngeneral allegations of knowledge, which are sufficient under Phelps,\n\ncited above, see Part I(e), are bolstered by the allegation that Hasty\n\ndirected other officers to set up procedures for the ADMAX SHU.\n\n     Hasty’s final argument is that, even if the Plaintiff has pled\n\nthe violation of a clearly established right, Hasty’s actions were\n\nobjectively reasonable in the post-9/11 context.   He argues that the\n\nactions were taken “in the immediate aftermath of September 11th\n\nduring the course of a large-scale investigation of unprecedented\n\nscope in United States history, and Plaintiff was, at that time,\n\nconsidered to be possibly complicit in the terrorist acts.”        As\n\ndiscussed above, see Part I(f), the post-9/11 context does not lessen\n\nthe Plaintiff’s right, as a pretrial detainee, to be free of punitive\n\nconditions of confinement.\n\nIV. Excessive Force\n\n     The only argument of a Defendant directed to the claim of\n\nexcessive force is Hasty’s contention that the complaint does not\n\nallege his personal involvement.\n\n     The complaint alleges that Hasty knew or should have known of the\n\nMDC practice of beating detainees in the ADMAX SHU, that he knew or\n\nshould have known of the propensity of his subordinates to beat the\n\nPlaintiff unnecessarily, and that he was deliberately indifferent in\n\nfailing to take action to curtail the beatings.    The complaint also\n\nalleges that Hasty chose the officers who worked in the ADMAX SHU.\n\n     Applying the standards for supervisory liability, outlined above,\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fsee Part I(d), the Plaintiff’s allegations, on a notice pleading\n\nstandard, see Part I(e), suffice to state a claim of supervisory\n\nliability for the use of excessive force against the Plaintiff.            See\n\nPhelps, 308 F.3d at 187 n.6 (“[A] plaintiff’s allegation of knowledge\n\nis itself a particularized factual allegation, which he will have the\n\nopportunity to demonstrate at the appropriate time in the usual ways.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).            The plausibility standard\n\nrequires no subsidiary facts at the pleading stage to support an\n\nallegation of Hasty’s knowledge because it is at least plausible that\n\na warden would know of mistreatment inflicted by those under his\n\ncommand.   Whether such knowledge can be proven must await further\n\nproceedings.\n\nV. Interference with Right to Counsel\n\n      Hasty argues that the Plaintiff did not adequately plead a\n\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel because (1) the\n\ncomplaint does not state that he was charged with criminal (as opposed\n\nto immigration) offenses and (2) he failed to plead supervisory\n\ninvolvement.      Although, as Judge Gleeson observed, “the complaint\n\ncould have been more transparent regarding plaintiffs’ status as\n\npretrial detainees facing criminal charges,” see Dist. Ct. op. at *23,\n\nthe   complaint    does   refer   to   interference   with   the   Plaintiff’s\n\nconversations with his “criminal attorney.”            This allegation was\n\nsufficient to give Hasty “fair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is\n\nand the grounds upon which it rests.” Conley, 355 U.S. at 47.           As for\n\nthe issue of supervisory liability, the complaint alleges that Hasty\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\f“knew of and condoned the imposition of substantial restrictions on\n\nPlaintiff’s right to communicate with counsel.”            The Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations   of   knowledge   are    sufficient   to   state   a   claim   of\n\nsupervisory liability, and, for the reasons stated above, satisfy the\n\nplausibility standard without an allegation of subsidiary facts.\n\nVI. Unreasonable Searches\n\n     Hasty challenges Judge Gleeson’s conclusion that he is not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity at this stage on the Plaintiff’s Fourth\n\nAmendment claim on the grounds that (1) the law on prisoners’ Fourth\n\nAmendment right to be free from strip and body-cavity searches was not\n\nclearly established and (2) Judge Gleeson failed to explain why the\n\nsearches of the     Plaintiff did not serve legitimate penological\n\ninterests.\n\n     As to whether the right to be free from strip and body-cavity\n\nsearches was clearly established, Hasty argues that “the Circuits\n\ndiffer sharply on the existence of prisoner privacy rights under the\n\nFourth Amendment outside of prison cells.” This argument ignores the\n\nfact that it is this Circuit’s law that determines whether a right is\n\nclearly established for purposes of a qualified immunity defense, see\n\nTellier, 280 F.3d at 84, and Hasty does not reckon with the long line\n\nof Second Circuit cases on strip and body-cavity searches in prisons\n\nand jails. See, e.g., Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001);\n\nCovino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir. 1992); Weber v. Dell, 804\n\nF.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986).\n\n     Under the Saucier framework for considering a qualified immunity\n\n\n                                     -57-\n\fdefense, discussed above, we must first decide whether, assuming the\n\nPlaintiff’s allegations are true, his Fourth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated, which will require determining the proper standard for his\n\nclaim.\n\n     The Supreme Court has held that visual body-cavity searches of\n\npretrial   detainees   and   prisoners    after    contact   visits   are   not\n\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, even in the absence of\n\nprobable cause. See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558.          Emphasizing that the\n\nFourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches, the Court\n\ninstructed judges to consider “the scope of the particular intrusion,\n\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating\n\nit, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 558-59.           Because\n\nof the potential for smuggling money, drugs, and weapons into prisons,\n\nthe Court concluded that the practice of strip searching inmates after\n\ncontact visits was not facially unconstitutional. See id. at 559-60.\n\nApplying Wolfish, this Court has concluded that, while it might be\n\nreasonable to strip search a prisoner before initially placing him in\n\nadministrative detention, it would not be reasonable to conduct a\n\nsecond strip search shortly after the first search if the prisoner was\n\nunder continuous escort the entire time.          See Hodges v. Stanley, 712\n\nF.2d 34, 35 (2d Cir. 1983).\n\n     Since Wolfish and Hodges, two lines of cases involving strip\n\nsearches have evolved in this Circuit.             In Weber v. Dell, jail\n\nofficials conducted a visual body-cavity search on a woman arrested on\n\nmisdemeanor charges. See 804 F.2d at 799.          This Court ruled that\n\n\n                                   -58-\n\f       the Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from\n       performing strip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged\n       with misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the\n       officials have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is\n       concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime\n       charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee,\n       and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n\nId. at 802; see Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d\n\nCir. 1994) (accepting Weber but upholding immunity defense on the\n\nbasis of reasonable suspicion of contraband); Walsh v. Franco, 849\n\nF.2d   66,   69   (2d   Cir.   1988)   (applying   Weber   to   hold   a   search\n\nunconstitutional).\n\n       However, in Covino v. Patrissi, we applied the “legitimate\n\npenological interests” standard outlined in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n\n78, 89 (1987), to assess the constitutionality of a strip search of a\n\npretrial detainee held in a prison with sentenced inmates. The prison\n\nin which Covino was detained had a policy of random visual body-cavity\n\nsearches. Covino, 967 F.2d at 75.         Observing that the Supreme Court\n\napplied Turner’s “legitimate penological interests” test to all claims\n\nthat prison regulations violate constitutional rights, see Washington\n\nv. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 223-24 (1990), we analyzed the random search\n\npolicy under the four factors of Turner:\n\n       (i) whether there is a valid, rational connection between\n       the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\n       interest put forward to justify it; (ii) whether there are\n       alternative means of exercising the right in question that\n       remain open to prison inmates; (iii) whether accommodation\n       of the asserted constitutional right will have an\n       unreasonable impact upon guards and other inmates, and upon\n       the allocation of prison resources generally; and (iv)\n       whether there are reasonable alternatives available to the\n       prison authorities.\n\nCovino, 967 F.2d at 78-79 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90).\n\n                                       -59-\n\fApplying    these   factors,    we   concluded     that   the   regulation    was\n\nrationally related to legitimate security interests, there were no\n\nalternative means of exercising the detainee’s right that would allow\n\nthe prison to achieve the same level of effectiveness, the regulation\n\naccommodated the privacy rights of the detainee by conducting the\n\nsearch behind closed doors, and there was no “alternative that fully\n\naccommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid\n\npenological    interests.”     Id.   at   79-80   (internal     quotation   marks\n\nomitted).\n\n     In 2001, we attempted to reconcile these two lines of cases in\n\nShain v. Ellison, supra.        Judge Pooler’s opinion for the majority\n\nobserved that the Turner test governs the constitutionality of prison\n\nregulations. See Shain, 273 F.3d at 65.           By limiting Covino to prison\n\nregulations, she reconciled Covino and the “reasonable suspicion” line\n\nof cases beginning with Weber, which all concerned events occurring in\n\njails.     See id. at 65-66.     In concurrence, Judge Katzmann remarked\n\nthat this Circuit’s precedents required a distinction “either between\n\nmisdemeanors and felonies or between jails and prisons,” but observed\n\nthat he did not find the distinction persuasive.                 See id. at 70.\n\nJudge Cabranes, in dissent, criticized the jail/prison distinction and\n\nargued that Weber’s “reasonable suspicion” rule was not good law in\n\nlight of Turner. Id. at 71-74; see also N.G. v. Connecticut, 382 F.3d\n\n225, 234-35 (2d Cir. 2004) (rejecting the Turner standard for strip\n\nsearches in juvenile detention centers).\n\n     On this appeal, the parties assume, as did Judge Gleeson, see\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\fDist. Ct. op. at *26, that the proper inquiry is whether the Plaintiff\n\nwas housed at a jail or a prison.        Finding that the MDC was most like\n\na prison, Judge Gleeson applied the Covino/Turner standard. See id.\n\nThis was correct.    The Plaintiff was confined for an extended period\n\nof time in a prison-like environment, and it appears that he was\n\ncharged with felonies, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1028. In the environment\n\nwhere the Plaintiff was held, the lesser reasonable suspicion standard\n\nwould jeopardize prison officials’ ability to maintain security.\n\n     As    Judge Gleeson recognized, even if the precise standard\n\ngoverning intrusive searches of the Plaintiff at the MDC might not\n\nhave been clearly established in 2001, it was clearly established that\n\neven the standard most favorable to prison officials required that\n\nstrip and body-cavity searches be rationally related to legitimate\n\ngovernment purposes. Cf. Hodges, 712 F.2d at 35 (holding that a\n\nplaintiff stated a Fourth Amendment claim where consecutive body-\n\ncavity searches were unnecessary).         The complaint alleges that the\n\nPlaintiff was routinely strip searched twice after returning from the\n\nmedical clinic or court and that, on one occasion, the Plaintiff was\n\nsubjected to three serial strip and body-cavity searches in the same\n\nroom.   He also alleges that he was subjected to strip and body-cavity\n\nsearches    every   morning.     These    allegations   may   reasonably   be\n\nunderstood to claim that repeated strip and body-cavity searches were\n\nunrelated to legitimate government purposes and apparently were\n\nperformed to punish.           The Plaintiff has adequately alleged a\n\nviolation of his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.              Of\n\n\n                                    -61-\n\fcourse, the success or failure of these claims will turn on the\n\nspecific facts that are revealed after discovery or at trial.\n\n     Although exigent circumstances can justify some conduct that\n\nwould otherwise violate Fourth Amendment standards, see, e.g., Tyler,\n\n436 U.S. at 509 (exigent circumstances justify warrantless entry into\n\na home), the post-9/11 context does not provide a basis for conducting\n\nrepeated and needless strip and body-cavity searches of a pretrial\n\ndetainee. See Part I(f), above.\n\nVII. Interference with Religious Practices\n\n     Hasty also argues that Judge Gleeson should have dismissed the\n\nPlaintiff’s First Amendment claim against him on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds because (1) BOP regulations “conclusively establish” a lack of\n\npersonal involvement and (2) the Plaintiff did not allege a violation\n\nof his First Amendment rights.\n\n     Both arguments lack merit. Hasty contends that the only “policy”\n\non religion at the MDC was the official BOP policy, codified at 28\n\nC.F.R. part 548, and that the Plaintiff has not indicated that these\n\npolicies were suspended or that he availed himself of available\n\ncomplaint procedures, see 28 C.F.R. part 542. Hasty contends that he\n\n“was under no clearly established constitutional obligation to take\n\naffirmative steps to inquire whether Plaintiff observed particular\n\nreligious practices, but as the BOP regulations instruct, Plaintiff\n\nhad the responsibility to make his religious preferences known.” Br.\n\nfor Hasty at 47.     But neither the complaint procedures nor the\n\nofficial policy governing religion allowed Hasty to ignore violations\n\n\n                                  -62-\n\fof detainees’ First Amendment rights.    If Hasty is arguing that the\n\nPlaintiff has forfeited his right to recover damages because he did\n\nnot follow administrative complaint procedures, this may be relevant\n\nto the merits of the case, but it is not relevant to a qualified\n\nimmunity defense.\n\n     Similarly without merit, Hasty argues that he could not be\n\npersonally involved in any deprivations of religious freedom because\n\nBOP regulations establish that prison chaplains “are responsible for\n\nmanaging religious activities within the institution.” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 548.12.   As the Plaintiff points out, however, Hasty ignores other\n\nregulations stating that the warden determines, among other things,\n\nwhat religious items may be used by prisoners, see id. § 548.16, and\n\nwhether attendance at religious functions is open to all prisoners,\n\nid. § 548.15.\n\n     Hasty’s second argument is that Plaintiff has not alleged a\n\nviolation of his First Amendment rights.      He relies on O’Lone v.\n\nEstate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342 (1987), which applied Turner’s\n\n“legitimate penological interests” test to First Amendment claims, see\n\nid. at 348-49. Though recognizing that a prison regulation precluded\n\nsome Muslim prisoners from attending Friday prayers, see id. at 345,\n\nthe Supreme Court found the regulation justified under Turner,\n\nfocusing on the     officials’ legitimate security objectives and the\n\navailability of other channels by which prisoners could exercise their\n\nreligious rights, see id. at 350-53.    In the pending case, however,\n\nthe Plaintiff alleges that he was not allowed to attend Friday\n\n\n                                 -63-\n\fprayers, that prison guards banged on his door when he tried to pray,\n\nand that his Koran was routinely confiscated.11                These allegations\n\nsuffice to preclude a qualified immunity defense at this stage of the\n\nlitigation.      In particular, consideration of Hasty’s arguments--that\n\n“restrictions on movement and possessions . . . were a necessary part\n\nof the legitimate and proper functioning of the maximum security\n\nprocedures      in   the   ADMAX   SHU”    and   that   such   restrictions     were\n\n“justified by security concerns and other institutional needs,” Br.\n\nfor   Hasty     at   49-50--must    await    factual    discovery   so   that    the\n\nGovernment’s asserted security interests can be assessed against a\n\nfactual record of what restrictions actually existed and what purpose\n\nthey served.\n\nVIII. Racial and Religious Discrimination\n\n      The Defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity\n\non the Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination\n\nand Fifth Amendment claim of racial or ethnic discrimination on three\n\ngrounds: (1) the Plaintiff has failed to state a violation of clearly\n\nestablished rights, (2) the Plaintiff’s allegations of discriminatory\n\nintent are too conclusory, and (3) the Plaintiff has not alleged the\n\npersonal involvement of Ashcroft and Mueller.12\n\n      11\n           Hasty’s arguments that the repeated banging on Iqbal’s cell\n\nwhile he prayed shows that he was at least allowed to pray, and that\n\nthe repeated confiscation of his Koran shows that he was at least\n\npermitted to have a Koran need no response.\n      12\n           Judge Gleeson dismissed the discrimination claims against the\n\n                                          -64-\n\f       The arguments of Ashcroft and Mueller challenging the sufficiency\n\nof the Plaintiff’s race, ethnic, and religious discrimination claims\n\nmisunderstand his complaint. They contend that his “complaint amounts\n\nto an objection that most of those persons determined to be of high\n\ninterest to the 9/11 investigation were Muslim or from certain Arab\n\ncountries,” which they justify by pointing out that the 9/11 hijackers\n\nwere Muslims from Arab countries.               However, what the Plaintiff is\n\nalleging   is   that    he   was    deemed     to   be       “of   high    interest,”      and\n\naccordingly was kept in the ADMAX SHU under harsh conditions, solely\n\nbecause of his race, ethnicity, and religion.                       The Plaintiff also\n\nalleges that “Defendants specifically targeted [him] for mistreatment\n\nbecause    of   [his]    race,     religion,    and      national         origin.”       These\n\nallegations     are     sufficient     to    state       a    claim       of    animus-based\n\ndiscrimination        that   any    “reasonably          competent         officer”      would\n\nunderstand to have been illegal under prior case law. See Malley, 475\n\nU.S. at 341; see also Hayden v. County of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 48 (2d\n\nCir.   1999)    (stating     that    racial     classifications                violate   Equal\n\nProtection Clause where motivated by racial animus and having a\n\ndiscriminatory effect). Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s racial, ethnic,\n\nand religious discrimination claims cannot be dismissed on qualified\n\nimmunity grounds at this stage of the litigation.\n\n       Hasty also argues that the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim\n\nof discrimination.       Citing Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination\n\nCommittee, 525 U.S. 471 (1999) (“AAADC”), he argues that the Equal\n\n\nBOP Defendants. See Dist. Ct. op. at *29.\n\n                                        -65-\n\fProtection Clause does not apply in the context of proceedings to\n\nremove illegal aliens and that the Government can permissibly deem\n\nnationals of a particular country to be a special threat.               In AAADC,\n\nthe   Supreme    Court   concluded   that   a   provision    of   the    Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(g), deprived the federal courts of jurisdiction to consider an\n\nillegal alien’s selective enforcement challenge to deportation. See\n\n525 U.S. at 487. The Court rejected the argument that it nevertheless\n\nhad jurisdiction to consider an alien’s constitutional arguments,\n\nholding   that    “an    alien   unlawfully     in   this   country      has   no\n\nconstitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense\n\nagainst his deportation,” see id. at 488, even when the Government\n\ndeports the alien “for the additional reason that it believes him to\n\nbe a member of an organization that supports terrorist activity,” id.\n\nat 492. AAADC affords the Defendants no relief. The Plaintiff is not\n\nchallenging his deportation or even his arrest on criminal charges.\n\nMoreover, AAADC does not stand for the proposition that the Government\n\nmay subject members of a particular race, ethnicity, or religion to\n\nmore restrictive conditions of confinement than members of other\n\nraces, ethnic backgrounds, or religions.\n\n      The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff’s allegations of racial,\n\nethnic, and religious animus are too conclusory.            But, as discussed\n\nabove, see Part I(e), Crawford-El indicates that courts cannot require\n\na heightened pleading standard for civil rights complaints involving\n\nimproper motive. In Phillip, 316 F.3d at 298-99, this Court held that\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\fSwierkiewicz’s notice pleading standard applied to a civil rights\n\ncomplaint alleging racial animus.       Although recognizing that the\n\ncomplaint did not “contain many evidentiary allegations relevant to\n\nintent,” see id. at 299, we found the allegations sufficient to state\n\na claim, observing that the complaint alleged that the plaintiffs were\n\nAfrican-American, described the defendants’ actions in detail, and\n\nalleged that the plaintiffs were selected for maltreatment “solely\n\nbecause of their color,” id. at 298.\n\n     The Plaintiff’s allegations suffice to state claims of racial,\n\nethnic, and religious discrimination.    He alleges in particular that\n\nthe FBI Defendants classified him “of high interest” solely because of\n\nhis race, ethnic background, and religion and not because of any\n\nevidence of involvement in terrorism.     He offers additional factual\n\nsupport for this allegation, stating that “within the New York area,\n\nall Arab Muslim men arrested on criminal or immigration charges while\n\nthe FBI was following an investigative lead into the September 11th\n\nattacks--however unrelated the arrestee was to the investigation--were\n\nimmediately classified as ‘of interest’ to the post-September 11th\n\ninvestigation.”   We need not consider at this stage of the litigation\n\nwhether these allegations are alone sufficient to state a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional violation under the circumstances presented\n\nbecause they are sufficient to state a violation when combined with\n\nthe Plaintiff’s allegation that he was singled out for mistreatment\n\nand for unnecessarily punitive conditions of confinement based on his\n\nracial, ethnic, and religious characteristics.\n\n\n                                 -67-\n\f      Finally, Ashcroft and Mueller argue that the Plaintiff failed to\n\nallege their personal involvement in any discrimination. However, the\n\ncomplaint alleges broadly that Ashcroft and Mueller were instrumental\n\nin adopting the “policies and practices challenged here.”                          The\n\ncomplaint also alleges that the FBI, “under the direction of Defendant\n\nMueller,” arrested thousands of Arab Muslims and that Ashcroft and\n\nMueller “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to\n\nsubject Plaintiff[] to these conditions of confinement as a matter of\n\npolicy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national\n\norigin and for no legitimate penological interest.”                   The Plaintiff\n\nacknowledges that the FBI Defendants made the determination that\n\nPlaintiff was “of high interest,” but this allegation does not\n\nnecessarily insulate Ashcroft and Mueller from personal responsibility\n\nfor   the   actions    of   their   subordinates       under    the    standards   of\n\nsupervisory liability outlined above, see Part I(d).                    As with the\n\nprocedural due process claim, the allegation that Ashcroft and Mueller\n\ncondoned and agreed to the discrimination that the Plaintiff alleges\n\nsatisfies    the    plausibility     standard    without       an     allegation    of\n\nsubsidiary facts because of the likelihood that these senior officials\n\nwould   have       concerned   themselves       with     the     formulation       and\n\nimplementation of policies dealing with the confinement of those\n\narrested on federal charges in the New York City area and designated\n\n“of high interest” in the aftermath of 9/11.                   Whether or not the\n\nissues of personal involvement will be clarified by court-supervised\n\ndiscovery sufficient to support summary                judgment remains to be\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\fdetermined.\n\nIX. Section 1985(3) Conspiracy\n\n     The Defendants contend that they are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on the Plaintiff’s conspiracy claims under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1985(3) because (1) it was not clearly established that federal\n\nofficials were subject to liability under section 1985(3), and (2) the\n\nPlaintiff’s allegations of conspiracy are too conclusory to state a\n\nviolation of clearly established law.\n\n     Clearly established law.    A conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1985(3) has four elements: (1) a conspiracy, (2) for the purpose of\n\ndepriving any person or class of persons of the equal protection of\n\nthe laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws, (3) an\n\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) whereby a person is\n\ninjured in his person or property or deprived of a right or privilege\n\nof a citizen. See United Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners of\n\nAmerica, Local 610 v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 828-29 (1983).          In\n\naddition, the conspiracy must be motivated by some class-based animus.\n\nSee Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102 (1971).\n\n     In Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579 (2d Cir. 1949), this Court\n\nconsidered a section 1985(3) claim against several federal officials\n\nstemming from an allegedly false arrest.   The Court first held that\n\nthe officials had absolute immunity from the false arrest claim. See\n\nid. at 580-81.    Turning to the section 1985(3) claim, the Court\n\nrejected the plaintiff’s argument that “this language creates a claim\n\nagainst any two persons who conspire to injure another for spite or\n\n\n                                 -69-\n\fother improper motives, apparently because to single out anyone for\n\nillegal aggression is to deny him equal protection of the laws.” Id.\n\nat 581.     Gregoire has been interpreted by some lower courts to mean\n\nthat section 1985(3) does not apply to federal officials. See, e.g.,\n\nLofland v. Meyers, 442 F. Supp. 955, 957 (S.D.N.Y. 1977); Williams v.\n\nHalperin, 360 F. Supp. 554, 556 (S.D.N.Y. 1973); see also Hobson v.\n\nWilson, 737 F.2d 1, 19 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (criticizing Gregoire).\n\n     In Griffin, the Supreme Court held that section 1985(3) contains\n\nno   requirement    of   state   action    and   thus   applies   to   private\n\nconspiracies. See 403 U.S. at 101.         Although this Court has had no\n\noccasion since Gregoire to consider whether section 1985(3) applies to\n\nconspiracies among federal officials, numerous courts of appeals,\n\napplying Griffin, have concluded that section 1985(3) applies to\n\nfederal officials.       See, e.g., Hobson, 737 F.2d at 20; Jafree v.\n\nBarber, 689 F.2d 640, 643 (7th Cir. 1982); Gillespie v. Civiletti, 629\n\nF.2d 637, 641 (9th Cir. 1980); Dry Creek Lodge, Inc. v. United States,\n\n515 F.2d 926, 931 (10th Cir. 1975).13        We agree that the development\n\nof case law since Gregoire has eroded any basis for interpreting that\n\ndecision to render section 1985(3) inapplicable to federal officials.\n\n     13\n          BOP Defendant Cooksey cites post-Griffin cases from the Fifth\n\nand Third Circuits stating that section 1985(3) does not apply to\n\nfederal officials. See, e.g., Mack v. Alexander, 575 F.2d 488, 489\n\n(5th Cir. 1978); Bethea v. Reid, 445 F.2d 1163, 1164 (3d Cir. 1971).\n\nHowever, these cases cite pre-Griffin cases for this proposition and\n\nneglect to consider Griffin.\n\n                                    -70-\n\fAnd we also agree that, in the absence of prior Second Circuit case\n\nlaw on point, it was not clearly established in 2001 that section\n\n1985(3) applied to federal officials.          However, even without a\n\ndefinitive ruling from this Court on the application of section\n\n1985(3) to federal officials, federal officials could not reasonably\n\nhave believed that it was legally permissible for them to conspire\n\nwith other federal officials to deprive a person of equal protection\n\nof the laws, at least where the officials’ conduct, alleged to have\n\naccomplished the discriminatory object of the conspiracy, would\n\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause. As we have recently held, “[T]he\n\nproper inquiry is whether the right itself--rather than its source--is\n\nclearly established.” Russo v. City of Bridgeport, 479 F.3d 196, 212\n\n(2d Cir. 2007) (collecting cases).\n\n     Adequacy of allegations.      Applying the normal pleading rules\n\npreviously discussed, see Part I(e), even as supplemented by the\n\nplausibility   standard,   we   have   no   doubt   that   the   Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations of a conspiracy to discriminate on the basis of ethnicity\n\nand religion suffice to withstand a motion to dismiss.           Unlike the\n\nsituation in Bell Atlantic, we do not encounter here a bare allegation\n\nof conspiracy supported only by an allegation of conduct that is\n\nreadily explained as individual action plausibly taken in the actors’\n\nown economic interests.\n\nX. Personal Jurisdiction\n\n     The final issue is whether Judge Gleeson erred in denying the\n\nmotions by Ashcroft, Mueller, and FBI Defendant Rolince to dismiss for\n\n\n                                  -71-\n\flack of personal jurisdiction. Ordinarily, we would lack jurisdiction\n\nover this issue on this interlocutory appeal concerning qualified\n\nimmunity.     However, “[a] defendant who is entitled to immediate\n\nappellate review of a qualified immunity decision is also entitled to\n\nappellate review of pendant issues if those issues are inextricably\n\nintertwined with the question of qualified immunity or are otherwise\n\nnecessary to ensure meaningful review of it.” Toussie v. Powell, 323\n\nF.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n“Whether issues are inextricably intertwined is determined by whether\n\nthere is substantial factual overlap bearing on the issues raised.”\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Gleeson recognized the\n\noverlap between the Defendants’ personal jurisdiction arguments and\n\npersonal involvement arguments pertaining to qualified immunity. See\n\nDist. Ct. op. at *10.\n\n     Under    New   York’s   long-arm   statute,   a   court   may   exercise\n\njurisdiction over a non-domiciliary who “in person or through an agent\n\n. . . commits a tortious act within the state” so long as the cause of\n\naction arises from that act. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(2).            As the\n\nDistrict Court observed, see Dist. Ct. op. at *9-*10, personal\n\njurisdiction cannot be predicated solely on a defendant’s supervisory\n\nposition.    See Ontel Products, Inc. v. Project Strategies Corp., 899\n\nF. Supp. 1144, 1148 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).       Rather, a plaintiff must show\n\nthat a defendant “personally took part in the activities giving rise\n\nto the action at issue.” Id.\n\n     The same intertwining of the issue of personal involvement with\n\n\n                                   -72-\n\fthe issue of personal jurisdiction that provides us with pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction also demonstrates that the pleading of personal\n\ninvolvement suffices to establish personal jurisdiction, at least at\n\nthis preliminary stage of the litigation.\n\n                             Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the order of the District Court is\n\naffirmed as to the denial of the Defendants’ motions to dismiss all of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s claims, except for the claim of a violation of the\n\nright to procedural due process, as to which we reverse. In affirming\n\nalmost all of the District Court’s ruling, we emphasize that we do so\n\nat an early stage of the litigation.      We recognize, as did Judge\n\nGleeson in ruling on the Plaintiff’s procedural due process claim, see\n\nDist. Ct. op. at *21, that carefully limited and tightly controlled\n\ndiscovery by the Plaintiff as to certain officials will be appropriate\n\nto probe such matters as the Defendants’ personal involvement in\n\nseveral of the alleged deprivations of rights.    We are mindful too\n\nthat, for high level officials, this discovery might be either\n\npostponed until discovery of front-line officials is complete or\n\nsubject to District Court approval and additional limitations.     We\n\nalso recognize that the Defendants will be entitled to seek more\n\nspecific statements as to some of the Plaintiff’s claims and perhaps\n\nrenew their claims for qualified immunity by motions for summary\n\njudgment on a more fully developed record.\n\n     In sum, the serious allegations of gross mistreatment set forth\n\nin the complaint suffice, except as noted in this opinion, to defeat\n\n\n                                -73-\n\fthe Defendants’ attempt to terminate the lawsuit at a preliminary\n\nstage, but, consistent with the important policies that justify the\n\ndefense of qualified immunity, the defense may be reasserted in\n\nadvance of trial after the carefully controlled and limited discovery\n\nthat the District Court expects to supervise.\n\n     Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -74-\n\fJOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n        I concur fully in Judge Newman’s characteristically careful and comprehensive opinion, which seeks\n\nto hew closely to the relevant Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedents, including the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007). That said, it is worth underscoring that some of\n\nthose precedents are less than crystal clear and fully deserve reconsideration by the Supreme Court at the\n\nearliest opportunity; to say the least, “the guidance they provide is not readily harmonized,” Maj. Op. at 18.\n\n        Most importantly, the opinion’s discussion of the relevant pleading standards reflects the uneasy\n\ncompromise—forged partially in dicta by the Supreme Court in Crawford El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574\n\n(1998)—between a qualified immunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve “the effectiveness of\n\ngovernment as contemplated by our constitutional structure,” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 820 n.35\n\n(1982), and the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n        Here, that uneasy compromise presents itself in a case brought by Javaid Iqbal, a federally convicted\n\nfelon now residing in his native Pakistan. Iqbal does not challenge his arrest in the aftermath of 9/11, his\n\ndetention, his conviction, or his apparent subsequent deportation. Iqbal instead challenges his separation\n\nfrom the general prison population at the Metropolitan Detention Center and his treatment during that\n\nseparation. He claims that his separation stemmed from a general policy authorized at the highest levels of\n\ngovernment in the wake of 9/11.           But most, if not all, of the assertedly unlawful actions in his\n\ncomplaint—including the decision to place plaintiff in the ADMAX SHU and the abuses which purportedly\n\nensued there—are alleged to have been carried out by defendants much lower in the chain of command.\n\n        Nevertheless, as a result of the Supreme Court’s precedents interpreting Rule 8(a), even as modified\n\nby the “plausibility standard” established in Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1968, it is possible that the incumbent\n\nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a former Attorney General of the United States will have\n\n                                                      -75-\n\fto submit to discovery, and possibly to a jury trial, regarding Iqbal’s claims. If so, these officials—FBI\n\nDirector Robert Mueller and former Attorney General John Ashcroft —may be required to comply with\n\ninherently onerous discovery requests probing, inter alia, their possible knowledge of actions taken by\n\nsubordinates at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Prisons at a time when\n\nAshcroft and Mueller were trying to cope with a national and international security emergency unprecedented\n\nin the history of the American Republic. In Bell Atlantic, the Supreme Court has quite rightly expressed\n\nconcern that “careful case management” might not be able to “weed[] out early in the discovery process”\n\nan unmeritorious claim in private civil antitrust litigation, see Bell Atlantic, 127 S.Ct. at 1967, and might have\n\nlimited success in “checking discovery abuse,” id. This concern is all the more significant in the context of\n\na lawsuit against, inter alia, federal government officials charged with responsibility for national security and\n\nentitled by law to assert claims of qualified immunity. Even with the discovery safeguards carefully laid out\n\nin Judge Newman’s opinion, it seems that little would prevent other plaintiffs claiming to be aggrieved by\n\nnational security programs and policies of the federal government from following the blueprint laid out by\n\nthis lawsuit to require officials charged with protecting our nation from future attacks to submit to prolonged\n\nand vexatious discovery processes.\n\n        The decision in this case may be required by the faithful application of the relevant precedents by\n\na court of inferior jurisdiction. But a detached observer may wonder whether the balance struck here\n\nbetween the need to deter unlawful conduct and the dangers of exposing public officials to burdensome\n\nlitigation—a balance compelled by the precedents that bind us—jeopardizes the important policy interest\n\nJustice Stevens aptly described as “a national interest in enabling Cabinet officers with responsibilities in [the\n\nnational security] area to perform their sensitive duties with decisiveness and without potentially ruinous\n\n\n\n\n                                                      -76-\n\fhesitation.” Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 541 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).1\n\n\n\n\n          1\n              The Supreme Court’s recognition in Bell Atlantic that “proceeding to . . . discovery can be expensive,” Bell Atlantic, 127\n\nS. Ct. at 1967 has particular resonance where, as here, discovery would not only result in significant cost but would also deplete\n\nthe time and effectiveness of current officials and the personal resources of former officials. Indeed, as Justice Stevens noted,\n\n“[p]ersons of wisdom and honor will hesitate to answer the President’s call to serve in these vital positions if they fear that\n\nvexatious and [in some cases] politically motivated litigation associated with their public decisions will squander their time and\n\nreputation, and sap their personal financial resources when they leave office.” Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 542 (Stevens, J. concurring in\n\nthe judgment); see also Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814 (noting the “danger that fear of being sued will dampen the ardor of all but the most\n\nresolute, or the most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching discharge of their duties” (alteration in original) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                                                  -77-\n\f",

Sept.    27,   2005)   (“Dist.   Ct.   op.”).\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee Javaid Iqbal alleges that the Defendants-Appellants\n\ntook a series of unconstitutional actions against him in connection\n\nwith his confinement under harsh conditions at the Metropolitan\n\nDetention Center (“MDC”) in Brooklyn, after separation from the\n\ngeneral prison population. We conclude that the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity, to the extent rejected by the District Court, cannot be\n\nsustained as to any Defendants at this preliminary stage of the\n\nlitigation except as to the claim of violation of procedural due\n\nprocess rights, and we therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and\n\nremand.\n\n                                  Background\n\n       Parties. Iqbal is a Muslim Pakistani currently residing in\n\n                                     -3-\n\fPakistan.       Iqbal’s   co-plaintiff   was   Ehad   Elmaghraby,   a   Muslim\n\nEgyptian. After Judge Gleeson’s ruling on the motions to dismiss, the\n\nUnited States settled Elmaghraby’s claims by payment of $300,000.\n\n     Four groups of Defendants have filed appeals from Judge Gleeson’s\n\norder.      The first group consists of former Attorney General John\n\nAshcroft and current FBI Director Robert Mueller.          The second group\n\nconsists of Michael Rolince, former Chief of the FBI’s International\n\nTerrorism Operations Section, Counterterrorism Division, and Kenneth\n\nMaxwell, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s New\n\nYork Field Office (the “FBI Defendants”). The third group consists of\n\nformer BOP officials: Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, former BOP Director; David\n\nRardin, former Director of the Northeast Region of the Bureau of\n\nPrisons;     and   Michael   Cooksey,    former   Assistant   Director     for\n\nCorrectional Programs of the Bureau of Prisons (the “BOP Defendants”).\n\nThe fourth appeal was filed by Dennis Hasty, former MDC Warden. Other\n\nDefendants include Michael Zenk, MDC Warden at the time the lawsuit\n\nwas filed, other MDC staff, and the United States.\n\n     Factual allegations. The complaint alleges the following facts,\n\nwhich are assumed to be true for purposes of the pending appeals, as\n\nwe are required to do in reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss.\n\nSee Hill v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687266\"><a href=\"/opinion/687266/diane-hill-v-city-of-new-york-richard-dixon-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657 (2d Cir. 1995).             The\n\nPlaintiff was arrested by agents of the FBI and the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service on November 2, 2001.1 Following his arrest, he\n\n     1\n         The complaint does not identify the charges on which Iqbal was\n\narrested, but Judge Gleeson’s opinion states that he was charged with\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwas detained in the MDC’s general prison population until January 8,\n\n2002, when he was removed from the general prison population and\n\nassigned to a special section of the MDC known as the Administrative\n\nMaximum Special Housing Unit (“ADMAX SHU”), where he remained until he\n\nwas reassigned to the general prison population at the end of July\n\n2002.      On this appeal, we consider only claims concerning the\n\nPlaintiff’s      separation    from   the      general   prison   population   and\n\nconfinement thereafter in the ADMAX SHU.                 We do not consider the\n\nlegality of his arrest or his initial detention in the MDC.\n\n     The complaint further alleges that in the months after 9/11, the\n\nFBI arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its\n\ninvestigation into the events of 9/11.            The fact of their detention,\n\nits duration, and the conditions of confinement depended on whether\n\nthose arrested were classified as “of high interest.”               Many of these\n\nmen, including the Plaintiff, were classified as “of high interest”\n\nsolely because of their race,2 religion, and national origin and not\n\n\nconspiracy to defraud the United States and fraud with identification.\n\nDist. Ct. op. at *1 n.1.\n     2\n         Iqbal   is   a   Muslim   and   a     Pakistani,   but   not   an   Arab.\n\nNevertheless, his claim is fairly to be understood as alleging\n\nunlawful treatment based on his ethnicity, even if not technically on\n\na racial classification. And his allegations of what was done to Arab\n\nMuslims are fairly understood to mean that unlawful actions were taken\n\nagainst him because officials believed, perhaps because of his\n\nappearance and his ethnicity, that he was an Arab.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fbecause of any involvement in terrorism.       In the New York City area,\n\nall Arab Muslim men arrested on criminal or immigration charges while\n\nthe FBI was investigating a 9/11 lead were classified as “of high\n\ninterest.     The FBI Defendants were responsible for making these\n\nclassifications for detainees arrested in the New York City area,\n\nincluding the Plaintiff.\n\n      The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft and Mueller approved\n\na policy of holding detainees “of high interest” in highly restrictive\n\nconditions until they were “cleared” by the FBI.          In early October,\n\nBOP Defendant Cooksey, with the knowledge of BOP Defendant Sawyer,\n\ndirected that all detainees “of high interest” be held in the most\n\nrestrictive conditions possible.       FBI officials were aware that the\n\nBOP   was   relying   on   this   classification    to   hold   detainees    in\n\nrestrictive conditions.\n\n      The complaint further alleges that soon after 9/11, the MDC\n\ncreated within the MDC an ADMAX SHU, the BOP’s most restrictive type\n\nof confinement, to house the detainees “of high interest.”                  The\n\nprocedures for handling ADMAX SHU detainees were developed by MDC\n\nstaff, at the request of Defendant Hasty.          ADMAX SHU detainees were\n\npermitted to leave their cells only one hour each day, and all legal\n\nand social interactions were non-contact.           Movement outside their\n\ncells required handcuffs and leg irons and four-officer escorts.\n\nMovement inside their cells was monitored by video cameras. For many\n\nweeks, the detainees were subject to a communications blackout.\n\n      The complaint further alleges that the MDC did not conduct any\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\freview of the detainees’ segregation in the ADMAX SHU.          Instead, the\n\ndetainees remained in the ADMAX SHU until the FBI approved their\n\nrelease to the general population.       As a result, numerous detainees\n\nwere held in the ADMAX SHU for extended periods of time even though\n\nthere was no evidence linking them to terrorism.\n\n     The complaint further alleges that the Plaintiff was transferred\n\nto the ADMAX SHU on January 8, 2002.             He was kept in solitary\n\nconfinement.   Until March, the lights in his cell were left on almost\n\n24 hours a day, and MDC staff deliberately turned on air conditioning\n\nduring the winter and heating during the summer. MDC staff left the\n\nPlaintiff in the open-air recreation area for hours when it was\n\nraining and then turned on the air conditioner when he returned to his\n\ncell.   Whenever the Plaintiff was removed from his cell, he was\n\nhandcuffed and shackled. The Plaintiff was not provided with adequate\n\nfood and lost 40 pounds while in custody. MDC staff called him, among\n\nother things, a “terrorist” and a “Muslim killer.”\n\n     The complaint further alleges that the Plaintiff was brutally\n\nbeaten by MDC guards on two occasions: upon his transfer to the ADMAX\n\nSHU in January 2002 and again in March.        Following the March beating,\n\nthe Plaintiff was denied medical care for two weeks even though he was\n\nin excruciating pain.     He was also subjected to daily strip and body-\n\ncavity searches.    The March beating was prompted by the Plaintiff’s\n\nprotestations to a fourth consecutive strip and body-cavity search in\n\nthe same room.     MDC staff interfered with the Plaintiff’s prayers,\n\nroutinely   confiscated   his   Koran,   and   refused   to   permit   him   to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fparticipate in Friday prayer services. They also interfered with the\n\nPlaintiff’s communications with his defense attorney, for example, by\n\ndisconnecting       the   phone    if    the   Plaintiff     complained      about   his\n\nconditions of confinement and delaying his receipt of legal mail for\n\nup to two months.\n\n     The Plaintiff pled guilty on April 22, 2002, and was sentenced on\n\nSeptember 17, 2002.       He was released from the ADMAX SHU at the end of\n\nJuly 2002, after pleading guilty but before sentencing. Judge Gleeson\n\nconsidered the Plaintiff to be a pretrial detainee throughout his\n\nentire time in the ADMAX SHU. Dist. Ct. op. at *15 n.14.                             The\n\nPlaintiff     was   released      from   the     MDC   on   January    15,   2003,   and\n\nthereafter was removed to Pakistan (a fact not in the complaint but\n\nundisputed).\n\n     Litigation in the District Court.

Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”) claims for assault and\n\n           battery,      negligent    denial   of    medical    treatment,\n\n           intentional infliction of emotional distress: United\n\n           States.\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f     Ashcroft and Mueller, the FBI Defendants, the BOP Defendants,\n\nHasty, the MDC Warden, and an MDC medical assistant4 filed motions to\n\ndismiss on the grounds that (1) a Bivens action was precluded by\n\n“special factors”, (2) they were protected by qualified immunity, (3)\n\nthe supervisory defendants were not alleged to have                sufficient\n\npersonal involvement, and (4) Ashcroft, Mueller, the FBI Defendants,\n\nand the BOP Defendants were not subject to personal jurisdiction in\n\nNew York.     In addition, the United States moved to be substituted as\n\nthe defendant on the ATCA claim (Count 21) and for dismissal of that\n\nclaim.\n\n     With a few exceptions, Judge Gleeson denied the motions to\n\ndismiss.       He   first    rejected   Ashcroft’s   argument   that   “special\n\nfactors,” namely the post-9/11 context, precluded a Bivens action in\n\nthis case. See Dist. Ct. op. at *14. Judge Gleeson then turned to the\n\nsubstance of the Plaintiff’s Bivens claims. He denied Hasty’s motion\n\nto dismiss the conditions of confinement claims (Counts One and\n\nEight), concluding that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged (1)\n\nillegitimate reasons for the conditions of his confinement and (2)\n\nHasty’s personal involvement. See id. at *15-*17.               He also found\n\n\n     21.            Alien Tort Claims Act (“ATCA”) claim: Ashcroft and\n\n                    Mueller, FBI Defendants, BOP Defendants, Hasty, and MDC\n\n                    staff.\n     4\n         Zenk, the MDC Warden at the time the lawsuit was filed, and the\n\nMDC medical assistant are not appealing Judge Gleeson’s ruling.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fadequate allegations of Hasty’s personal involvement in the claims of\n\nexcessive force (Counts Three and Four), interference with the\n\nPlaintiff’s right to counsel (Count Five), unreasonable strip searches\n\n(Count Nine), and interference with the Plaintiff’s exercise of\n\nreligion (Count Ten). See id. at *22, *27, *28. However, he found the\n\nallegations insufficient to support the personal involvement of BOP\n\nDefendant Sawyer in the unreasonable strip searches and dismissed this\n\nclaim against her. See id. at *27.\n\n     With respect to the procedural due process claim (Count Two),\n\nJudge Gleeson found that the Plaintiff had alleged both a deprivation\n\nof a liberty interest that involved “atypical and significant”\n\nhardships compared to the conditions in the general prison population\n\nand the absence of any due process protections, that the Plaintiff’s\n\nright was clearly established, and that he could not assess the\n\nobjective reasonableness of the Defendants’ actions as a matter of law\n\nat this stage of the litigation. See id. at *18-*20.         He also found\n\nthat the Plaintiff had adequately alleged the personal involvement of\n\nall the Defendants, observing that “the post-September 11 context\n\nprovide[d]    support   for   [the    P]laintiffs’   assertions   that   [the\n\nD]efendants    were   involved   in   creating   and/or   implementing    the\n\ndetention policy under which [the P]laintiffs were confined without\n\ndue process.” See id. at *20-*21.            Finally, with respect to the\n\nprocedural due process claim, he limited the first stage of discovery\n\nto the issue of the Defendants’ personal involvement in the alleged\n\ndenial of due process. See id. at *21.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f     With respect to the Plaintiff’s Bivens claims of race and\n\nreligious discrimination (Counts 11 and 12), Judge Gleeson ruled that\n\nthe Plaintiff’s allegations that he was confined in significantly\n\nharsher conditions solely because of his race and religion were\n\nsufficient to state a cause of action. See id. at *29.            He also\n\nconcluded that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged the personal\n\ninvolvement of Ashcroft and Mueller, the FBI Defendants, and Hasty.\n\nSee id.   However, because the Plaintiff had not alleged that the BOP\n\nDefendants were involved in the challenged classification in any way,\n\nJudge Gleeson concluded that the Plaintiff had not alleged the\n\npersonal involvement of the BOP Defendants, and he dismissed these\n\nclaims against them. See id.\n\n     Turning to the Plaintiff’s statutory claims, Judge Gleeson\n\ndismissed the RFRA claims against all the Defendants, concluding that\n\nthey were entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly\n\nestablished that RFRA applied to federal government officials. See id.\n\nat *30-*31.    He also dismissed the ATCA claim after first having\n\nsubstituted the United States for the individual defendants. See id.\n\nat *34-*35.   Finally, he denied the motions to dismiss the section\n\n1985(3) conspiracy claims, rejecting the Defendants’ arguments that it\n\nwas not clearly established that section 1985 applied to federal\n\nofficers and concluding that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged the\n\nDefendants’   personal   involvement,   except   with   respect   to   the\n\nallegation that the BOP Defendants had conspired to subject the\n\nPlaintiff to unreasonable strip searches.

Their\n\narguments with respect to qualified immunity fall into several broad\n\ncategories:   (1)   the    Plaintiff’s       allegations     do     not    allege      the\n\nviolation of a clearly established right, (2) do not allege sufficient\n\npersonal involvement of the Defendants in the challenged actions, (3)\n\nare too conclusory to overcome a qualified immunity defense, and (4)\n\nthe Defendants’ actions were objectively reasonable.                    Permeating the\n\nDefendants’    assertion     of    a   qualified    immunity        defense      is    the\n\ncontention that, however the defense might be adjudicated in normal\n\ncircumstances, the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack created a\n\ncontext in which the defense must be assessed differently and, from\n\ntheir standpoint, favorably.\n\n     In addition, Ashcroft, Mueller, and FBI Defendant Rolince seek\n\nreview of the denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction, arguing that the issue of personal jurisdiction is\n\navailable for review on this interlocutory appeal because the issue is\n\ninextricably intertwined with that of qualified immunity.\n\n     Because many of the Defendants’ grounds for asserting an immunity\n\ndefense   overlap   with     respect        to   several    of    the      Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations, it will be convenient to consider separately each of the\n\nPlaintiff’s   causes    of   action     with     respect    to    the     one   or    more\n\nDefendants    against     whom    it   is   asserted,      rather       than    consider\n\nseparately the claims asserted against each Defendant. Before turning\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fto each of the Plaintiff’s allegations, we first consider the legal\n\nstandards that apply to nearly all of the Plaintiff’s claims and to\n\nmost of the grounds on which the Defendants assert their qualified\n\nimmunity defense.\n\nI. General Principles of Qualified Immunity\n\n     (a) Standard of review.   When a district court denies qualified\n\nimmunity on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “we review the district\n\ncourt’s denial de novo, accepting as true the material facts alleged\n\nin the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’\n\nfavor.” Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771972\"><a href=\"/opinion/771972/timothy-johnson-sr-and-luaine-sims-on-behalf-of-their-minor-son-tj-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n250 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n     (b) Appealability.    A district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity is appealable as a collateral order if it turns on an issue\n\nof law. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1985).     Thus, a\n\ndefendant may appeal a district court’s ruling denying qualified\n\nimmunity when, if a plaintiff’s allegations are assumed to be true,\n\nthe only question is whether the alleged conduct violated a clearly\n\nestablished right. See Locurto v. Safir, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774796\"><a href=\"/opinion/774796/joseph-locurto-v-howard-safir-commissioner-of-the-new-york-city-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 (2d Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n     (c) The qualified immunity defense.      Qualified immunity is an\n\nimmunity from suit and not just a defense to liability. See Saucier v.\n\nKatz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (2001).         The first step in a qualified\n\nimmunity inquiry is to determine whether the alleged facts demonstrate\n\nthat a defendant violated a constitutional right. See id. at 201; see\n\nalso Scott v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1774 & n.4 (2007).      If the\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fallegations show that a defendant violated a constitutional right, the\n\nnext step is to determine whether that right was clearly established\n\nat the time of the challenged action--that is, “whether it would be\n\nclear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the\n\nsituation he confronted.” See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.                 A defendant\n\nwill be entitled to qualified immunity if either (1) his actions did\n\nnot    violate   clearly    established   law   or   (2)   it   was     objectively\n\nreasonable for him to believe that his actions did not violate clearly\n\nestablished law. See Johnson, 239 F.3d at 250.\n\n       In determining whether a right was clearly established, the court\n\nmust assess whether “the contours of the right [were] sufficiently\n\nclear in the context of the alleged violation such that a reasonable\n\nofficial would understand that what he [was] doing violate[d] that\n\nright.” Id. at 250-51 (internal quotation marks omitted).                  To that\n\nend, the court should consider what a reasonable officer in the\n\ndefendant’s position would have known about the lawfulness of his\n\nconduct, “not what a lawyer would learn or intuit from researching\n\ncase    law.”    Id.   at    251   (internal    quotation       marks     omitted).\n\nFurthermore, the court need not identify “legal precedent addressing\n\nan identical factual scenario” to conclude that the right is clearly\n\nestablished. Id.; see also Tellier v. Fields, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776515\"><a href=\"/opinion/776515/rene-tellier-v-sharon-fields-correction-officer-willie-scott-former/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (noting that a law is “clearly established” so long as a ruling\n\non the issue is “clearly foreshadow[ed]” by this Circuit’s decisions).\n\n       (d) Personal involvement. Many of the Defendants claim qualified\n\nimmunity on the ground that the Plaintiff has failed to allege their\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fpersonal involvement in the challenged actions. All of the appealing\n\nDefendants are supervisory officials.                   The personal involvement of a\n\nsupervisor     may     be    established        by    showing    that   he    (1)    directly\n\nparticipated in the violation, (2) failed to remedy the violation\n\nafter being informed of it by report or appeal, (3) created a policy\n\nor   custom    under    which    the    violation        occurred,      (4)    was    grossly\n\nnegligent in supervising subordinates who committed the violation, or\n\n(5) was deliberately indifferent to the rights of others by failing to\n\nact on information that constitutional rights were being violated.

Coughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698654\"><a href=\"/opinion/698654/armando-colon-v-thomas-a-coughlin-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873 (2d Cir. 1995) (discussing section\n\n1983 liability).\n\n      Although a lack of personal involvement may be grounds for\n\ndismissing a claim on the merits (a ruling that would not be subject\n\nto an interlocutory appeal), such a lack is also relevant to a defense\n\nof qualified immunity because it goes to the question of whether a\n\ndefendant’s        actions    violated      a    clearly    established        right.

Although most of\n\nthe Defendants disclaim requiring the Plaintiff to meet a heightened\n\npleading standard, beyond the requirement of Conley v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1957), that a complaint “give the defendant fair notice\n\nof what the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,”\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), all the Defendants make the somewhat\n\nsimilar argument that “conclusory allegations” will not suffice to\n\nwithstand a qualified immunity defense, especially with respect to\n\nallegations    of   supervisory   involvement,   racial   and/or   religious\n\nanimus, or conspiracy.     BOP Defendant Cooksey explicitly urges us to\n\nadopt a heightened pleading standard in Bivens actions.\n\n     The pleading standard to overcome a qualified immunity defense\n\nappears to be an unsettled question in this Circuit.          Four Supreme\n\nCourt opinions provide guidance, although the guidance they provide is\n\nnot readily harmonized.      In Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\n\nIntelligence and Coordination Unit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), the Court\n\nrejected a heightened pleading standard in a civil rights action\n\nalleging municipal liability, applying instead only the traditional\n\nrequirement of “‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that\n\nthe pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. at 168 (quoting Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8(a)(2)).    In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguished\n\nbetween municipalities’ immunity from respondeat superior liability\n\nand government officials’ qualified immunity from suit. See id. at\n\n166. Arguably, this distinction could permit requiring a plaintiff to\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fsatisfy a heightened pleading standard of a cause of action in order\n\nto overcome a government official’s defense of qualified immunity.\n\nHowever, the Court’s opinion in Leatherman suggests that heightened\n\npleading standards are never permissible except when authorized by\n\nRule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See id. at 168\n\n(noting that Rule 9(b) “do[es] not include among the enumerated\n\nactions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability under\n\n§ 1983\").      Indeed, the Court observed that, in the absence of\n\namendment to Rules 8 or 9, the courts could rely only on control of\n\ndiscovery and summary judgment to “weed out unmeritorious claims.” Id.\n\nat 168-69.\n\n     A more pertinent precedent is Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), which concerned the adequacy of pleading a Title VII\n\ncomplaint.     The Court rejected what had been this Circuit’s rule\n\nrequiring    employment   discrimination   plaintiffs   to   allege   facts\n\nconstituting a prima facie case of employment discrimination. See id.\n\nat 515.      The Court again emphasized that the judicially imposed\n\nheightened pleading standard conflicted with Rule 8(a) and that a\n\nheightened pleading standard could be attained only “by the process of\n\namending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Leatherman and especially Swierkiewicz–-with their insistence\n\nthat courts cannot impose heightened pleading standards in the absence\n\nof statutory authorization--indicate that a court cannot impose a\n\nheightened pleading standard in Bivens (or other civil rights) actions\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fagainst individual officials, a precept we have heeded since the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Swierkiewicz.

In\n\nCrawford-El v. Britton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), the D.C. Circuit had\n\nrecognized a heightened burden of proof in cases against government\n\nofficials alleging unconstitutional motive. See id. at 582-83.    The\n\nCourt observed that the D.C. Circuit had adopted the heightened\n\nstandard in an attempt “to address a potentially serious problem:\n\nBecause an official’s state of mind is easy to allege and hard to\n\ndisprove, insubstantial claims that turn on improper intent may be\n\nless amenable to summary disposition than other types of claims\n\nagainst government officials.” Id. at 584-85 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   Although the Supreme Court recognized this problem, it\n\nrejected the heightened standard of proof.\n\n     The Court held that the D.C. Circuit’s rule was not compelled by\n\neither the holding or the reasoning of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982). In Harlow, the Court had stated that “bare allegations of\n\nmalice should not suffice to subject government officials either to\n\nthe costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.” Id.\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fat 817-18.     However, as the Court explained in Crawford-El, this\n\nstatement merely concerned a plaintiff’s attempt to        overcome a\n\nlegitimate qualified immunity defense by alleging malicious intent;\n\nthis holding was irrelevant to a plaintiff’s burden in alleging a\n\nconstitutional violation of which improper motive is an essential\n\nelement. See 523 U.S. at 588-89.        Neither did Harlow’s reasoning\n\nrequire a heightened burden of proof: the Court observed that there\n\nexisted other mechanisms for protecting officials from unmeritorious\n\nactions, such as the requirement that the officials’ conduct violate\n\nclearly established law, the need to prove causation, and procedural\n\nprotections.    See id. at 590-93.\n\n     The Court acknowledged that the usual pleading standard would\n\nsometimes not preclude at least limited discovery to amplify general\n\nallegations.   The Court observed that Harlow only “sought to protect\n\nofficials from the costs of ‘broad-reaching’ discovery” and that\n\nlimited discovery is sometimes necessary to adjudicate a qualified\n\nimmunity defense. See id. at 593 n.14.         The Court concluded by\n\nobserving that “broad discretion” in the discovery process is more\n\n“useful and equitable” than categorical rules such as that of the D.C.\n\nCircuit. See id. at 601.\n\n     What Crawford-El gave civil rights plaintiffs with respect to\n\ntraditional notice pleading, however, it might have modified by\n\npermitting some post-complaint detailing of a claim.     In discussing\n\nthe procedural mechanisms available to judges in civil rights actions,\n\nat least those alleging wrongful motive, the Court observed that,\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fbefore permitting discovery, a court could require a plaintiff to “put\n\nforward specific, non-conclusory factual allegations that establish\n\nimproper motive causing cognizable injury in order to survive a\n\nprediscovery motion for dismissal or summary judgment.” Id. at 598\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps significantly, the Court\n\nquoted    the   phrase   “put    forward    specific,   nonconclusory   factual\n\nallegations” from Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion in Siegert v.\n\nGilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112594\"><a href=\"/opinion/112594/siegert-v-gilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), in which he had explicitly advocated a\n\nheightened pleading standard for civil rights actions requiring a\n\nshowing of malice.

Bell Atlantic held that an allegation\n\nof parallel conduct by competitors, without more, does not suffice to\n\nplead an antitrust violation under 15 U.S.C. § 1. See id. at 1961.\n\nThe Court required, in addition, “enough factual matter (taken as\n\ntrue) to suggest that an agreement was made.” Id. at 1965.   However,\n\nthe Court’s explanation for its holding indicated that it intended to\n\nmake some alteration in the regime of pure notice pleading that had\n\nprevailed in the federal courts ever since Conley v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957), was decided half a century ago.   The nature and extent of\n\nthat alteration is not clear because the Court’s explanation contains\n\nseveral, not entirely consistent, signals, which we consider (not\n\nnecessarily in the order set forth in the Court’s opinion).\n\n     Some of these signals point toward a new and heightened pleading\n\nstandard.   First, the Court explicitly disavowed the oft-quoted\n\nstatement in Conley of “‘the accepted rule that a complaint should not\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his\n\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.’” Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct.\n\nat 1968 (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46).    Bell Atlantic asserted\n\nthat this “no set of facts” language “has earned retirement” and “is\n\nbest forgotten.” Id. at 1969.\n\n     Second, the Court, using a variety of phrases, indicated that\n\nmore than notice of a claim is needed to allege a section 1 violation\n\nbased on competitors’ parallel conduct.        For example, the Court\n\n\n                                -23-\n\frequired “enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an\n\nagreement was made,” id. at 1965; “enough fact to raise a reasonable\n\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement,”\n\nid.; “facts that are suggestive enough to render a § 1 conspiracy\n\nplausible,” id.; “allegations of parallel conduct . . . placed in a\n\ncontext that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement,” id. at\n\n1966; “allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)\n\nagreement,” id.; a “plain statement” (as specified in Rule 8(a)(2))\n\nwith “enough heft” to show entitlement to relief, id.; and “enough\n\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” id.\n\nat 1974, and also stated that the line “between the factually neutral\n\nand the factually suggestive. . . must be crossed to enter the realm\n\nof plausible liability,” id. at 1966 n.5., and that “the complaint\n\nwarranted dismissal because it failed in toto to render plaintiffs’\n\nentitlement to relief plausible,” id. at 1973 n.14.\n\n     Third, the Court discounted the ability of “‘careful        case\n\nmanagement,’” “to weed[] out early in the discovery process” “a claim\n\njust shy of a plausible entitlement.” Id. at 1967 (quoting id. at 1975\n\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)).\n\n     Fourth, the Court encapsulated its various formulations of what\n\nis required into what it labeled “the plausibility standard.” Id. at\n\n1968. Indeed, the Court used the word “plausibility” or an adjectival\n\nor adverbial form of the word fifteen times (not counting quotations).\n\n     On the other hand, some of the Court’s linguistic signals point\n\naway from a heightened pleading standard and suggest that whatever the\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fCourt is requiring in Bell Atlantic might be limited to, or at least\n\napplied most rigorously in, the context of either all section 1\n\nallegations or perhaps only those section 1 allegations relying on\n\ncompetitors’ parallel conduct. First, the Court explicitly disclaimed\n\nthat it was “requir[ing] heightened fact pleading of specifics,” id.\n\nat 1974, and emphasized the continued viability of Swierkiewicz, see\n\nid. at 1973-74, which had rejected a heightened pleading standard.\n\nSee also Erickson v. Pardus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145722\"><a href=\"/opinion/145722/erickson-v-pardus/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2200 (2007) (citing Bell\n\nAtlantic’s citation of Swierkiewicz).\n\n     Second, although the Court faulted the plaintiffs’ complaint for\n\nalleging “merely legal conclusions” of conspiracy, id. at 1970, it\n\nexplicitly noted with approval Form 9 of the Federal Civil Rules,\n\nComplaint for Negligence, which, with respect to the ground of\n\nliability, alleges only that the defendant “negligently drove a motor\n\nvehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing [an identified]\n\nhighway,” Fed. R. Civ. P. App. Form 9. See Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct.\n\nat 1970 n.10.   The Court noted that Form 9 specifies the particular\n\nhighway the plaintiff was crossing and the date and time of the\n\naccident, see id., but took no notice of the total lack of an\n\nallegation of the respects in which the defendant is alleged to have\n\nbeen negligent, i.e., driving too fast, crossing the center line,\n\nrunning a traffic light or stop sign, or even generally failing to\n\nmaintain a proper lookout.   The adequacy of a generalized allegation\n\nof negligence in the approved Form 9 seems to weigh heavily against\n\nreading Bell Atlantic to condemn the insufficiency of all legal\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fconclusions in a pleading, as long as the defendant is given notice of\n\nthe date, time, and place where the legally vulnerable conduct\n\noccurred.\n\n     Third, the Court placed heavy emphasis on the “sprawling, costly,\n\nand hugely time-consuming” discovery that would ensue in permitting a\n\nbare allegation of an antitrust conspiracy to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss, see id. at 1967 n.6, and expressed concern that such\n\ndiscovery “will push cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic\n\ncases,” id. at 1967. These concerns provide some basis for believing\n\nthat whatever adjustment in pleading standards results from Bell\n\nAtlantic is limited to cases where massive discovery is likely to\n\ncreate unacceptable settlement pressures.\n\n     Fourth, although the Court expressed doubts about the ability of\n\ndistrict courts to “weed[] out” through case management in the\n\ndiscovery process “a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to\n\nrelief,” id. (emphasis added), the Court did not disclaim its prior\n\nstatement that “federal courts and litigants must rely on summary\n\njudgment and control of discovery to weed out unmeritorious claims\n\nsooner rather than later.” Leatherman, 507 U.S. at 168-69 (emphasis\n\nadded).5 Leaving Leatherman and Crawford-El undisturbed (compared to\n\nthe explicit disavowal of the “no set of facts” language of Conley)\n\nfurther suggests that Bell Atlantic, or at least its full force, is\n\n     5\n         There   is   no   possibility   that   the   “weed   out”   language   of\n\nLeatherman was overlooked; it was called to the Court’s attention in\n\nJustice Stevens’s dissent. See Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1982.\n\n                                         -26-\n\flimited to the antitrust context.\n\n     Fifth, just two weeks after issuing its opinion in Bell Atlantic,\n\nthe Court cited it for the traditional proposition that “[s]pecific\n\nfacts are not necessary [for a pleading that satisfies Rule 8(a)(2)];\n\nthe statement need only ‘”give the defendant fair notice of what the\n\n. . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”’ Erickson, 127 S.\n\nCt. at 2200 (quoting Bell Atlantic’s quotation from Conley) (omission\n\nin original).\n\n     These conflicting signals create some uncertainty as to the\n\nintended scope of the Court’s decision.6     We are reluctant to assume\n\nthat all of the language of Bell Atlantic applies only to section 1\n\nallegations based on competitors’ parallel conduct or, slightly more\n\nbroadly, only to antitrust cases.7       Some of the language relating\n\n     6\n         The parties, not surprisingly, view Bell Atlantic entirely\n\ndifferently.      Defendant Hasty characterizes the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision as a “sea change” in the pleading standard of Rule 8, see\n\nLetter from Michael L. Martinez, counsel for Defendant Hasty, to the\n\nActing Clerk of this Court (May 25, 2007); the Plaintiff emphasizes\n\nthe antitrust holding of the decision, see Letter from Alexander A.\n\nReinert, counsel for Plaintiff Iqbal, to the Acting Clerk of this\n\nCourt (May 22, 2007).\n     7\n         For example, it would be cavalier to believe that the Court’s\n\nrejection of the “no set of facts” language from Conley, which has\n\nbeen cited by federal courts at least 10,000 times in a wide variety\n\nof contexts (according to a Westlaw search), applies only to section\n\n                                  -27-\n\fgenerally to Rule 8 pleading standards seems to be so integral to the\n\nrationale of the Court’s parallel conduct holding as to constitute a\n\nnecessary part of that holding.          See Pierre N. Leval, Judging under\n\nthe Constitution: Dicta about Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249, 1257\n\n(2006)    (“The    distinction    [between     holding   and    dictum]      requires\n\nrecognition of what was the question before the court upon which the\n\njudgment depended, how (and by what reasoning) the court resolved the\n\nquestion, and what role, if any, the proposition played in the\n\nreasoning that led to the judgment.”).\n\n     After careful consideration of the Court’s opinion and the\n\nconflicting signals from it that we have identified, we believe the\n\nCourt is not requiring a universal standard of heightened fact\n\npleading, but is instead requiring a flexible “plausibility standard,”\n\nwhich    obliges    a   pleader   to   amplify   a   claim     with   some    factual\n\nallegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to\n\nrender the claim plausible.        We will say more about this approach as\n\nwe apply it below to some of the Plaintiff’s specific allegations.\n\n     Notwithstanding what we understand to be the essential message of\n\nBell Atlantic, we acknowledge that we see some merit in the argument\n\nin favor of a heightened pleading standard in this case for two\n\nreasons.    First, qualified immunity is a privilege that is essential\n\nto the ability of government officials to carry out their public roles\n\neffectively without fear of undue harassment by litigation.                   In this\n\nrespect, the factors favoring a heightened pleading standard to\n\n\n1 antitrust claims.\n\n                                        -28-\n\fovercome a qualified immunity defense are distinguishable from the\n\npurely prudential and policy-driven factors that the Supreme Court\n\nfound inadequate to justify a heightened pleading standard in the\n\nTitle VII context. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 514-15.\n\n     Second, some of the allegations in the Plaintiff’s complaint,\n\nalthough not entirely conclusory, suggest that some of the Plaintiff’s\n\nclaims are based not on facts supporting the claim but, rather, on\n\ngeneralized   allegations    of   supervisory    involvement.    Therefore,\n\nallowing some of the Plaintiff’s claims to survive a motion to dismiss\n\nmight   facilitate   the   very   type   of   broad-ranging   discovery   and\n\nlitigation burdens that the qualified immunity privilege was intended\n\nto prevent.\n\n     Nevertheless, although Swierkiewicz was decided in the context of\n\nTitle VII, we are mindful of the Supreme Court’s statement in that\n\ndecision that heightened pleading requirements “must be attained by\n\nthe process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial\n\ninterpretation.” Id. at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAbsent any indication from the Supreme Court that qualified immunity\n\nmight warrant an exception to this general approach and the explicit\n\ndisclaimer of a heightened pleading standard in Bell Atlantic,\n\nreinforced by the reversal of the Tenth Circuit’s use of a heightened\n\npleading standard in Erickson, we conclude that a heightened pleading\n\nrule may not be imposed.      However, in order to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss under the plausibility standard of Bell Atlantic, a conclusory\n\nallegation concerning some elements of a plaintiff’s claims might need\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fto be fleshed out by a plaintiff’s response to a defendant’s motion\n\nfor a more definite statement. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).                      In\n\naddition, even though a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a\n\ndistrict court, while mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of\n\nthe qualified immunity defense by dismissing non-meritorious claims\n\nagainst   public    officials   at   an   early    stage   of   litigation,   may\n\nnonetheless consider exercising its discretion to permit some limited\n\nand tightly controlled reciprocal discovery so that a defendant may\n\nprobe for amplification of a plaintiff’s claims and a plaintiff may\n\nprobe such matters as a defendant’s knowledge of relevant facts and\n\npersonal involvement in challenged conduct.           In a case such as this\n\nwhere some of the defendants are current or former senior officials of\n\nthe Government, against whom broad-ranging allegations of knowledge\n\nand personal involvement are easily made, a district court might wish\n\nto structure such limited discovery by examining written responses to\n\ninterrogatories and requests to admit before authorizing depositions,\n\nand by deferring discovery directed to high-level officials until\n\ndiscovery   of     front-line   officials    has    been   completed   and    has\n\ndemonstrated the need for discovery higher up the ranks. If discovery\n\ndirected to current or former senior officials becomes warranted, a\n\ndistrict court might also consider making all such discovery subject\n\nto prior court approval.\n\n     We note that Rule 8(a)’s liberal pleading requirement, when\n\napplied mechanically without countervailing discovery safeguards,\n\nthreatens to create a dilemma between adhering to the Federal Rules\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fand abiding by the principle that qualified immunity is an immunity\n\nfrom suit as well as from liability. Therefore, we emphasize that, as\n\nthe claims surviving this ruling are litigated on remand, the District\n\nCourt not only may, but “must exercise its discretion in a way that\n\nprotects the substance of the qualified immunity defense . . . so that\n\nofficials [or former officials] are not subjected to unnecessary and\n\nburdensome discovery or trial proceedings.” Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at\n\n597-98 (emphasis added). In addition, the District Court should\n\nprovide ample opportunity for the Defendants to seek summary judgment\n\nif, after carefully targeted discovery, the evidence indicates that\n\ncertain of the Defendants were not sufficiently involved in the\n\nalleged violations to support a finding of personal liability, or that\n\nno constitutional violation took place. See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 821\n\n(Brennan, J., concurring) (“[S]ummary judgment will also be readily\n\navailable whenever the plaintiff cannot prove, as a threshold matter,\n\nthat a violation of his constitutional rights actually occurred.”).\n\nWe give these matters additional consideration below with respect to\n\nparticular claims.\n\n     (f) The post-9/11 context. Several Defendants contend that even\n\nif the Plaintiff’s complaint would survive a motion to dismiss in the\n\nface of a qualified immunity defense under normal circumstances, the\n\npost-9/11 context requires a different outcome.     This argument is\n\nadvanced on three fronts.   First, some Defendants contend that the\n\nGovernment was entitled to take certain actions that might not have\n\nbeen lawful before 9/11 because the Government’s interests assumed\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fspecial weight in the post-9/11 context. Second, some Defendants\n\ncontend that, even if the law was clearly established as to the\n\nexistence of a right claimed to have been violated, it was not clearly\n\nestablished in the extraordinary circumstances of the 9/11 attack and\n\nits aftermath.   Third, some Defendants contend that the post-9/11\n\ncontext renders their actions objectively reasonable, an argument we\n\ndo not reach in view of our disposition of their second contention.\n\n     We fully recognize the gravity of the situation that confronted\n\ninvestigative officials of the United States as a consequence of the\n\n9/11 attack. We also recognize that some forms of governmental action\n\nare permitted in emergency situations that would exceed constitutional\n\nlimits in normal times. See Home Building & Loan Association v.\n\nBlaisdell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102167\"><a href=\"/opinion/102167/home-building-loan-assn-v-blaisdell/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425-26 (1934) (“While emergency does not\n\ncreate power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of\n\npower.”).   But most of the rights that the Plaintiff contends were\n\nviolated do not vary with surrounding circumstances, such as the right\n\nnot to be subjected to needlessly harsh conditions of confinement, the\n\nright to be free from the use of excessive force, and the right not to\n\nbe subjected to ethnic or religious discrimination.   The strength of\n\nour system of constitutional    rights derives from the steadfast\n\nprotection of those rights in both normal and unusual times.\n\n     With some rights, for example, the right to be free from\n\nunreasonable searches, the existence of exigent circumstances might\n\njustify governmental action that would not otherwise be permitted.\n\nSee, e.g., Michigan v. Tyler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109874\"><a href=\"/opinion/109874/michigan-v-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (1978) (exigent\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fcircumstances permitted warrantless entry into home).              But, as we\n\ndiscuss below, see Part VI, the exigent circumstances of the post-9/11\n\ncontext do not diminish the Plaintiff’s right not to be needlessly\n\nharassed and mistreated in the confines of a prison cell by repeated\n\nstrip and body-cavity searches.       This and other rights, such as the\n\nright to be free from use of excessive force and not to be subjected\n\nto ethnic or religious discrimination, were all clearly established\n\nprior to 9/11, and they remained clearly established even in the\n\naftermath   of   that   horrific   event.      To   whatever   extent   exigent\n\ncircumstances might affect the lawfulness of the Defendants’ actions\n\nor might have justified an objectively reasonable belief that their\n\nactions did not violate clearly established law, we consider the\n\nargument in connection with a particular claim.\n\n     With these general principles in mind, we turn to the Plaintiff’s\n\nspecific claims.\n\nII. Procedural Due Process\n\n     The    Plaintiff   alleges    that   Ashcroft    and   Mueller,    the   FBI\n\nDefendants, the BOP Defendants, and Hasty adopted a policy under which\n\nhe was deprived of a liberty interest without any of the procedural\n\nprotections required by due process of law.            His allegation of the\n\ndeprivation of a liberty interest, even while lawfully confined\n\nwithout bail on criminal charges, is based on his placement in\n\nsolitary confinement, where he was subjected to needlessly harsh\n\nrestrictions that were atypical and significant when compared to those\n\nin the rest of the MDC population.          The Defendants contend that (1)\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fthe Plaintiff did not allege that the confinement was punitive; (2) no\n\nprocedural due process right was violated because the Plaintiff did\n\nnot have a liberty interest in avoiding extended confinement in the\n\nADMAX SHU and, even if he did, he received all the process that was\n\ndue; (3) even if the Plaintiff’s procedural due process right was\n\nviolated, the contours of this right were not clearly established at\n\nthe time of the events in question; (4) the Defendants’ actions were\n\nobjectively reasonable in the post-9/11 context; and (5) the Plaintiff\n\nhas failed to allege personal involvement.\n\n     We are required by the Supreme Court’s decision in Saucier to\n\nassess these arguments within a two-part framework, asking first\n\nwhether the alleged facts show a violation of a constitutional right,\n\nsee Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, and, if so, “whether the right was\n\nclearly established . . . in light of the specific context of the\n\ncase,” see id. The first, second, and fifth of the Defendants’\n\narguments bear on the initial issue of whether a violation has been\n\nalleged;   the   third   argument--whether   the   right   was   clearly\n\nestablished--is precisely the second issue under Saucier; and the\n\nfourth argument is often a further component of a qualified immunity\n\ndefense because even if the law was clearly established, it might have\n\nbeen objectively reasonable, on the facts of a particular case, for a\n\ndefendant to believe that the actions taken did not violate that\n\nestablished law, see Johnson, 239 F.3d at 250.\n\n     (a) Has a Violation of a Procedural Due Process Right Been\n\nAdequately Pleaded?\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f     In assessing the adequacy of the Plaintiff’s pleading of a\n\nprocedural due process violation we first consider the basic question\n\nof whether the Plaintiff has pleaded the existence of a liberty\n\ninterest and entitlement to procedures that were not provided and then\n\nconsider the Defendants’ arguments that punitive intent and personal\n\ninvolvement were not adequately pleaded.\n\n     (i) The Plaintiff’s procedural due process right. In concluding\n\nthat the Plaintiff had a protected liberty interest, Judge Gleeson\n\nrelied on this Court’s decision in Tellier v. Fields, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776515\"><a href=\"/opinion/776515/rene-tellier-v-sharon-fields-correction-officer-willie-scott-former/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d\n\nCir. 2000). See Dist. Ct. op. at *17-*18.          In Tellier, a federal\n\ninmate allegedly was placed in administrative detention in the SHU for\n\nmore than 500 days without being informed of the reasons for his\n\nplacement or receiving any hearings. See 280 F.3d at 74.              The\n\nregulations governing administrative segregation, 28 C.F.R. § 541.22,\n\nentitle inmates to “an administrative detention order detailing the\n\nreasons for placing an inmate in administrative detention . . .\n\nprovided institutional security is not compromised thereby.” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 541.22(b).    Moreover, the regulations require a Segregation Review\n\nOfficer to “hold a hearing and formally review the status of each\n\ninmate who spends seven continuous days in administrative detention,\n\nand thereafter . . . hold a hearing and review these cases formally at\n\nleast   every   30   days.”   Id.   §   541.22(c)(1).

Since Sandin, the rule in this Circuit has been that a\n\nprisoner has a protected liberty interest “‘only if the deprivation\n\n. . . is atypical and significant and the state has created the\n\nliberty interest by statute or regulation.’” Tellier, 280 F.3d at 80\n\n(quoting Sealey v.

Relevant factors include both\n\nthe conditions of segregation and its duration. See Palmer, 364 F.3d\n\nat 64. Segregation of longer than 305 days in standard SHU conditions\n\nis sufficiently atypical to require procedural due process protection\n\nunder Sandin. See id. at 65 (citing Colon v.

Turning      to   the    language      of   the\n\nregulations, the Court agreed that because the initial decision to\n\nplace a prisoner in administrative detention is a discretionary one,\n\nthe plaintiff did not have a “protected liberty interest that is\n\nviolated   when    the   Warden    removes     him    or   her    from   the    general\n\npopulation.” Id. at 82.          However, the Court found, the regulations\n\nconstrain the warden’s discretion in maintaining a prisoner in\n\ndetention and the procedures “are designed to ensure that a prisoner\n\nis kept in SHU for no longer than is necessary.” Id. at 82-83.\n\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that section 541.22 “creates a\n\nprotectable liberty interest when an official’s failure to adhere to\n\nthe [regulation] results in an atypical, significant deprivation.” Id.\n\nat 83 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Relying on Tellier, Judge Gleeson concluded that the Plaintiff\n\nhad a clearly established protectable liberty interest in avoiding\n\ncontinued detention in the ADMAX SHU. See Dist. Ct. op. at *18.                       On\n\nappeal, the Defendants contend that Tellier is no longer good law in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Wilkinson v. Austin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).         In Wilkinson, the Supreme Court considered\n\nSandin’s application to segregation in Ohio’s Supermax facility.\n\nInmates in the Supermax facility were detained in solitary confinement\n\nindefinitely, they remained in their cells 23 hours a day, the lights\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fwere turned on constantly, they could not go outside for recreation,\n\nand they were limited to non-contact visits. See id. at 214-15.   The\n\nCourt confirmed Sandin’s holding that “a liberty interest in avoiding\n\nparticular conditions of confinement may arise from state policies or\n\nregulations, subject to the important     limitations set forth in\n\nSandin,” id. at 222, but observed that “the touchstone of the inquiry\n\ninto the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in\n\navoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of\n\nregulations regarding those conditions    but the nature of those\n\nconditions themselves in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison\n\nlife,” id. at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted).      The Court\n\nrecognized that the courts of appeals had struggled to identify a\n\nbaseline for determining what constitutes an atypical and significant\n\nhardship, but it concluded that confinement in the Supermax facility\n\n“imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible\n\nbaseline.” Id. Having found that the prisoner had a protected liberty\n\ninterest, the Court concluded that Ohio’s “informal, nonadversary\n\nprocedures” were sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. Id.\n\nat 228-29.\n\n     The Defendants argue that Wilkinson abrogates Tellier or that it\n\nat least renders the relevant standard unclear because it instructs\n\ncourts to consider the nature of the conditions, not the requirements\n\nof the regulations.    We disagree for two reasons.     First, while\n\nWilkinson instructs courts to focus on the nature of the conditions,\n\nit nonetheless explains that the “liberty interest in avoiding\n\n\n                                -38-\n\fparticular conditions of confinement . . . arise[s] from state\n\npolicies or regulations.” Id. at 222.              Following Tellier, Judge\n\nGleeson looked to the duration and conditions of confinement, as\n\ninstructed by Wilkinson. See Dist. Ct. op. at *18.\n\n     Second, and more significantly, for at least half (if not all) of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s confinement in the ADMAX SHU, he was a pretrial\n\ndetainee, not a convicted prisoner.8          This Court has said that Sandin\n\n     8\n         The   Defendants   do   not   seriously   contest   Judge   Gleeson’s\n\ncharacterization of the Plaintiff as a pretrial detainee, although\n\nAshcroft and Mueller briefly contend that his private interest in\n\navoiding detention in the ADMAX SHU after he pled guilty should be\n\nevaluated “within the context of the prison system,” i.e., under\n\nEighth Amendment standards.

Because none of the Defendants\n\nseriously challenges Judge Gleeson’s characterization of the Plaintiff\n\nas a pretrial detainee throughout his entire confinement in the ADMAX\n\nSHU, we will refer to him as a pretrial detainee, a status that\n\n                                       -39-\n\fdoes not apply to pretrial detainees and that, accordingly, pretrial\n\ndetainees need not show that an imposed restraint imposes atypical and\n\nsignificant hardships to state deprivation of a liberty interest\n\nprotected by procedural due process. See Benjamin v. Fraser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774797\"><a href=\"/opinion/774797/james-benjamin-v-william-j-fraser-commissioner-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188-89 (2d Cir. 2001) (“Benjamin I”).   In Benjamin I, this Court\n\naffirmed the district court’s ruling that the imposition of painful\n\nphysical restraints during the movement of pretrial detainees required\n\n“reasonable after-the-fact procedural protections to ensure that such\n\nrestrictions on liberty [would] be terminated reasonably soon if they\n\n[had] no justification.” Id. at 188.\n\n     In sum, Wilkinson does not affect the validity of Judge Gleeson’s\n\nruling that the Plaintiff had a protected liberty interest because (1)\n\nhe considered the Plaintiff’s allegations of atypical and significant\n\nhardships and (2) the Wilkinson and Sandin analysis does not apply to\n\nthe interval of the Plaintiff’s pretrial detention.        Under this\n\nCourt’s case law, the Plaintiff’s confinement of more than six months\n\nfell in the intermediate range, thereby requiring inquiry into the\n\nconditions of his confinement, which he sufficiently alleges to have\n\nbeen severe.   Even under Wilkinson, the conditions under which the\n\nPlaintiff alleges that he was confined--solitary confinement, repeated\n\n\nplainly applies during the several months of confinement prior to the\n\nPlaintiff’s plea.    We do not consider the question of whether\n\nconvicted, but unsentenced, inmates are pretrial detainees under the\n\nSupreme Court’s jurisprudence establishing criteria for evaluating\n\nconstitutional limits on conditions of confinement.\n\n                                -40-\n\fstrip and body-cavity searches, beatings, exposure to excessive heat\n\nand cold, very limited exercise, and almost constant lighting--as well\n\nas the initially indefinite duration of confinement could be found to\n\nconstitute atypical and significant hardships. See 545 U.S. at 223-24.\n\nThe Plaintiff has alleged a protected liberty interest in avoiding\n\nmore than six months’ detention in the ADMAX SHU, especially in light\n\nof his status as a pretrial detainee.\n\n       The Defendants also dispute the violation of a procedural due\n\nprocess right by arguing that, even if the Plaintiff had a protected\n\nliberty interest in avoiding extended detention in the ADMAX SHU, he\n\nreceived all the process that was due by virtue of the FBI’s review.\n\nThis    argument   is   unavailing   at   this    preliminary      stage   of    the\n\nlitigation.     In Wilkinson, the Supreme Court applied the familiar\n\nbalancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), to\n\ndetermine     whether   the   plaintiff     received     adequate     procedural\n\nprotections. See 545 U.S. at 224-25.        Under the second prong of this\n\ntest, the Court observed that inmates received “notice of the factual\n\nbasis    leading   to   consideration     for    OSP   placement    and    a    fair\n\nopportunity for rebuttal,” stating that “these are among the most\n\nimportant procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous\n\ndeprivations.”      Id. at 225-26.        After weighing all the relevant\n\nfactors, the Court found that “[w]here the inquiry draws more on the\n\nexperience of prison administrators, and where the State’s interest\n\nimplicates the safety of other inmates and prison personnel, . . .\n\ninformal, nonadversary procedures” were sufficient.             Id. at 228-29.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fIn the pending case, the Plaintiff alleges that he did not even\n\nreceive notice of the factual grounds on which he was being detained\n\nin the ADMAX SHU nor did he have any opportunity for rebuttal.\n\n     We recognize that in the post-9/11 context the first Mathews\n\nfactor–-the gravity of the Government’s interest–-is appropriately\n\naccorded more weight than would otherwise be warranted.      It might be\n\nthat the combination of (1) the Government’s interest, accorded added\n\nweight in the post-9/11 context, (2) the Plaintiff’s interest in\n\navoiding confinement under harsh conditions, and (3) the risk of an\n\nerroneous determination of the need for such confinement would, on\n\nbalance, lead to the conclusion that the Government need not have\n\ngiven the Plaintiff notice and a chance for rebuttal before placing\n\nhim in the ADMAX SHU.        However, once it became clear that the\n\nPlaintiff was going to be confined in the ADMAX SHU for an extended\n\nperiod of time, some process was required.        We cannot say in the\n\nabsence of a developed factual record whether the FBI’s clearance\n\nprocedure comported with the requirements of the Due Process Clause as\n\ninterpreted in Mathews and subsequent cases.     The sparse record thus\n\nfar developed provides no indication as to what security-related steps\n\nthe Defendants were taking that might justify prolonged confinement.\n\nNor does that record indicate in what respect providing the Plaintiff\n\nwith some notice of the basis for his separation in the ADMAX SHU and\n\naffording some opportunity for rebuttal would have impaired national\n\nsecurity   interests   or   legitimate   penological   interests   of   the\n\nGovernment.   The Government has not as yet had an opportunity to\n\n\n                                  -42-\n\frefute    the    Plaintiff’s    allegation    that   there    was    no    evidence\n\nconnecting him to terrorism.         Accordingly, we cannot say whether the\n\nGovernment’s     national   security    interests    rendered       the   clearance\n\nprocedure sufficient to satisfy procedural due process requirements or\n\nwhether   more    traditional    procedural      protections    were      required.\n\nNevertheless, because we are required at this stage of the litigation\n\nto accept all of the Plaintiff’s allegations as true and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in his favor, we cannot say that the Plaintiff\n\nhas failed to plead a viable claim under the procedural component of\n\nthe Due Process Clause.          Judge Gleeson dismissed the Plaintiff’s\n\nprocedural due process claim with respect to the initial confinement\n\nin the ADMAX SHU, Dist. Ct. op. at *17 n.18, but properly ruled that\n\nthe Plaintiff had stated a procedural due process claim with respect\n\nto his continued confinement, see id. at *18-*19.\n\n     (ii) Punitive intent. Ashcroft, Mueller, and Hasty, citing Bell\n\nv. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), contend that the Plaintiff has not\n\nstated a claim that the confinement in the ADMAX SHU violated his\n\nprocedural due process rights because he has not alleged that the\n\nconfinement was punitive.       Preliminarily, we note that the complaint\n\nalleges   that    the   Defendants    designed   a   policy    under      which   the\n\nPlaintiff was “arbitrarily designated to be confined in the ADMAX SHU”\n\nand that “[k]eeping Plaintiff[] in isolation . . . amounted to the\n\nwillful, malicious, and unnecessary infliction of pain and suffering.”\n\nThis is sufficient to allege that the confinement was punitive in\n\nnature.\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f     More     fundamentally,   however,        we   deem   unsupportable    the\n\nDefendants’ premise that the Plaintiff’s procedural due process claim\n\nrequires an allegation of punitive intent.           Defendants Ashcroft and\n\nMueller cite Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535, for the proposition that “in\n\nevaluating the constitutionality of conditions or restrictions of\n\npretrial detention, the proper inquiry under the Due Process Clause is\n\nwhether the conditions ‘amount to punishment of the detainee.’”\n\nHowever, Wolfish did not involve a claim that inadequate procedures\n\nhad been used to impose challenged conditions of confinement.               The\n\nclaim there was that the challenged conditions of confinement, being\n\npunitive, could not be imposed on pretrial detainees at all because\n\nthey had not been convicted.     Although the Court did not consider the\n\nchallenged conditions punitive, it ruled that “under the Due Process\n\nClause, a detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of\n\nguilt in accordance with due process of law.” Id.                This ruling\n\nimplements the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.9\n\n     9\n         Since Wolfish prohibited punishment prior to the process of\n\nadjudicating guilt, it could be considered a decision vindicating a\n\nprocedural claim.

McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1974), and continues through Hewitt v.

Wolff outlined fairly extensive\n\nprocedures that must be observed before a prisoner’s liberty interest\n\nin   retaining   good   time   credits   could   be   impaired   because   of\n\ndisciplinary violations. 418 U.S. at 563-72.

Sandin modified Helms by making\n\nthe existence of a prisoner’s liberty interest turn primarily on the\n\natypical nature of the challenged conditions of confinement, 515 U.S.\n\nat 483-87, but did not alter the basic requirement that where a\n\nprisoner’s liberty interest exists, its impairment requires some\n\nprocedural protections.\n\n      The Plaintiff’s liberty interest, based primarily on a federal\n\nregulation, is entitled to some procedural protection regardless of\n\npunitive intent.    To the extent that the interest derives directly\n\nfrom the Due Process Clause (and hence requires procedural protection\n\nonly when punishment is imposed, see Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535), the\n\nharsh conditions set forth in the complaint adequately meet the\n\ncriteria for punishment, see Kennedy v.

Defendants Ashcroft and\n\nMueller contend that the Plaintiff has not adequately alleged their\n\npersonal involvement in the denial of procedural due process because\n\nthe continued detention decision was made by       FBI subordinates.\n\nApplying the standards applicable to personal involvement outlined\n\nabove, we reject this claim at this stage of the litigation. Ashcroft\n\nand Mueller are alleged to have condoned the policy under which the\n\nPlaintiff was held in harsh conditions of confinement until “cleared”\n\nby the FBI.   Since the complaint adequately alleges, for purposes of\n\na motion to dismiss, that procedural due process required some\n\nprocedures beyond FBI clearance, the allegation of condoning the\n\npolicy of holding the Plaintiff in the ADMAX SHU until cleared\n\nsuffices, at the pleading stage, to defeat dismissal for lack of\n\npersonal involvement.\n\n     At the other end of the leadership chain, Defendant Hasty asserts\n\nhis lack of personal involvement because the continued detention\n\ndecision was made far above his level of responsibility.     But this\n\ndefense also cannot prevail at this stage of the litigation. Cf.\n\nAnthony v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783048\"><a href=\"/opinion/783048/no-01-7978l/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138 (2d Cir. 2003)\n\n(“Plausible instructions from a superior . . . support qualified\n\nimmunity where, viewed objectively in light of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances, they could lead a reasonable officer to conclude that\n\nthe necessary legal justification for his actions exists (e.g.[,]\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\f. . . exigent circumstances).” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nHasty is alleged to have known of the continued detention in the ADMAX\n\nSHU and the absence of procedural protections for the Plaintiff.\n\nWhether his conduct as a subordinate was objectively reasonable under\n\nall the circumstances is an issue distinct from the adequacy of the\n\npleading of personal involvement.\n\n     Between these extremes in the official hierarchy, the lack of\n\nadequate allegations of personal knowledge of, or involvement in, the\n\nPlaintiff’s continued detention is also asserted by the FBI Defendants\n\nand the BOP Defendants.   However, the complaint at least implicitly\n\nalleges the knowledge of the FBI Defendants by stating that they\n\n“failed to approve post-September 11 detainees’ release to general\n\npopulation.”   With respect to the BOP Defendants, the complaint\n\nalleges that BOP Defendant Cooksey “directed that all detainees ‘of\n\nhigh interest’ be confined in the most restrictive conditions possible\n\nuntil cleared by the FBI,” that BOP Defendant Sawyer approved this\n\npolicy, and that BOP Defendant Rardin, along with others, designed the\n\npolicy of arbitrary confinement in the ADMAX SHU.   The FBI Defendants\n\nalso dispute their personal involvement in a procedural due process\n\nviolation by arguing that they could not reasonably be expected to\n\nknow about the BOP regulations. However, some factual development of\n\nthis claim would have to precede its determination.    Moreover, even\n\nabsent the FBI Defendants’ knowledge of the BOP regulation, the\n\ncomplaint can support the inference that the FBI Defendants understood\n\nthat their alleged role in the clearance procedure was linked to a\n\n\n                                -47-\n\fdetainee’s release to the general population.             This suffices to\n\novercome the defense of no personal involvement at this stage of the\n\nlitigation.\n\n       It is arguable that, under the plausibility standard of Bell\n\nAtlantic, some subsidiary facts must be alleged to plead adequately\n\nthat    Ashcroft   and    Mueller   condoned   the   Plaintiff’s   continued\n\nconfinement in the ADMAX SHU, that Hasty had knowledge of that\n\nconfinement, or that the mid-level Defendants knew the relationship\n\nbetween their clearance procedure and the Plaintiff’s release to the\n\ngeneral population.        However, all of the Plaintiff’s allegations\n\nrespecting the personal involvement of these Defendants are entirely\n\nplausible, without allegations of additional subsidiary facts.          This\n\nis clearly so with respect to Hasty and the mid-level Defendants.\n\nEven as to Ashcroft and Mueller, it is plausible to believe that\n\nsenior officials of the Department of Justice would be aware of\n\npolicies concerning       the detention of those arrested by federal\n\nofficers in the New York City area in the aftermath of 9/11 and would\n\nknow about, condone, or otherwise have personal involvement in the\n\nimplementation of those policies.           Sustaining the adequacy of a\n\npleading of personal involvement in these circumstances runs no risk\n\nthat every prisoner complaining of a denial of rights while in federal\n\ncustody anywhere in the United States can survive a motion to dismiss\n\nsimply by alleging that the Attorney General knew of or condoned the\n\nalleged violation.       And, like the Form 9 complaint approved in Bell\n\nAtlantic, Iqbal’s complaint informs all of the Defendants of the time\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fframe and place of the alleged violations.\n\n       (b) Was the Plaintiff’s Right to Procedural Due Process Clearly\n\nEstablished?\n\n       Although we conclude that the Plaintiff has adequately pleaded a\n\nviolation of a procedural due process right, we also conclude that in\n\nthis     case   “officers    of     reasonable     competence        could   [have]\n\ndisagree[d],” Malley v. Briggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (1986), whether\n\ntheir conduct violated a clearly established procedural due process\n\nright.    Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s right to additional procedures\n\nwas not clearly established with the level of specificity that is\n\nrequired to defeat a qualified immunity defense. See Brosseau v.\n\nHaugen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199-200 (2004).\n\n       Several factors combine to create this lack of clarity in prior\n\ncase    law.    First,   some   uncertainty      exists    in   determining       when\n\nadministrative    segregation       procedures    are     required    even   in    the\n\nordinary criminal context.        Our case law would require an officer in\n\nthe Defendants’ situation to consider various factors including the\n\nlength of the Plaintiff’s confinement, the extent to which the\n\nconditions of confinement were atypical, the text of relevant BOP\n\nregulations, and the Plaintiff’s status as a pretrial detainee. See,\n\ne.g., Tellier, 280 F.3d at 79-83. As noted above, no single factor is\n\ndispositive in this case, which concerns administrative segregation of\n\napproximately six months.         Although the harshness of the conditions\n\nalleged weigh in favor of requiring procedural protections, an officer\n\ncould    reasonably   note   that    the   Plaintiff’s      six-month    continued\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\fconfinement was comparable to the duration of confinements in cases\n\nthat we characterized in Tellier as involving “relatively brief\n\nperiods of confinement.” See id. at 85.\n\n     Second, uncertainty in existing case law is heightened by the\n\nfact that, even on the facts alleged in the complaint, which specified\n\nthat the “of high interest” designation pertained to the Government’s\n\npost-9/11 terrorism investigation, the investigation leading to the\n\nPlaintiff’s separation from the general prison population could be\n\nreasonably understood by all of the Defendants to relate to matters of\n\nnational security, rather than an ordinary criminal investigation.\n\nPrior to the instant case, neither the Supreme Court nor our Court had\n\nconsidered whether the Due Process Clause requires officials to\n\nprovide   ordinary   administrative   segregation   hearings   to   persons\n\ndetained under special conditions of confinement until cleared of\n\nconnection with activities threatening national security. Cf. Forsyth,\n\n472 U.S. at 534-35 (granting Attorney General qualified immunity for\n\nwarrantless   wiretapping   for   national    security   purposes   despite\n\nprohibitions of warrantless wiretapping in criminal context).\n\n     Third, the BOP regulation on which the Plaintiff relies itself\n\ncontains potentially relevant exceptions that undermine certainty as\n\nto established requirements of law.       “Administrative detention is to\n\nbe used only for short periods of time except . . . where there are\n\nexceptional circumstances, ordinarily tied to security or complex\n\ninvestigative concerns,” 28 C.F.R. § 541.22(c)(1) (emphasis added),\n\nand inmates are entitled to “an administrative detention order\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\fdetailing     the   reasons   for   placing   an   inmate   in   administrative\n\ndetention . . . provided institutional security is not compromised\n\nthereby,” id. § 541. 22(b) (emphasis added).\n\n     In sum, these factors, taken together, would suffice to raise “a\n\nlegitimate question,” Forsyth, 472 U.S. at 535 n.12, among Government\n\nofficials as to whether the Due Process Clause required administrative\n\nsegregation hearings or any procedures other than the FBI’s clearance\n\nsystem. See id. (“[W]here there is a legitimate question whether an\n\nexception to [a constitutional requirement] exists,” failure to abide\n\nby the requirement “cannot be said [to have] violate[d] clearly\n\nestablished law.” (emphasis added)).           Accordingly, we will direct\n\ndismissal of the portions of the Plaintiff’s complaint alleging\n\nviolations of procedural due process rights. See Compl. ¶¶ 204-06.\n\nIII. Conditions of Confinement\n\n     Hasty contends that Judge Gleeson should have dismissed the\n\nPlaintiff’s conditions of confinement claims against him on the ground\n\nof qualified immunity because (1) the Plaintiff did not allege\n\nconditions amounting to a violation of substantive due process rights,\n\n(2) the Plaintiff failed to allege Hasty’s deliberate indifference to\n\nthe maintenance of the conditions of confinement, and (3) Hasty’s\n\nactions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances.10\n\n     10\n          There is some question as to whether Hasty sought to dismiss the\n\nsubstantive due process claim or the excessive force claim, see Part\n\nIV, infra, in the District Court on the ground of qualified immunity,\n\nas distinguished from the merits of the claim.         However, the District\n\n                                      -51-\n\f     Because   the   Plaintiff   was   a   pretrial   detainee   during   his\n\ndetention in the ADMAX SHU, his challenge to the conditions of his\n\nconfinement arises from the substantive component of the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment and not from the cruel and unusual\n\npunishment standards of the Eighth Amendment. See Benjamin v. Fraser,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783505\"><a href=\"/opinion/783505/james-benjamin-plaintiffs-appellees-cross-appellants-v-william-j-fraser/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (2d Cir. 2003) (“Benjamin II”).         Pretrial detainees\n\nhave not been convicted of a crime and thus “may not be punished in\n\nany manner--neither cruelly and unusually nor otherwise.” Id. at 49-\n\n50. Courts considering challenges to confinement brought by pretrial\n\ndetainees must first consider whether the circumstances of the\n\nparticular confinement render the confinement punitive; since some\n\nrestraint is necessary to confine a pretrial detainee, not all\n\nuncomfortable conditions or restrictions are necessarily punitive. Id.\n\nat 50. In Bell v. Wolfish, supra, the seminal case on the substantive\n\ndue process claims of pretrial detainees, the Supreme Court recognized\n\nthe following factors as relevant to the determination of whether a\n\ncondition of confinement is punitive:\n\n     “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or\n     restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a\n     punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of\n     scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional\n     aims of punishment--retribution and deterrence, whether the\n     behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an\n     alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected\n\n\nCourt understood all the Defendants to “seek dismissal of all claims\n\nagainst them on qualified immunity grounds,” Dist. Ct. op. at *10, and\n\nwe are satisfied that we have jurisdiction of an appeal from the\n\nrulings that are premised on that understanding.\n\n                                   -52-\n\f     is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in\n     relation to the alternative purpose assigned . . . .”\n\n441 U.S. at 537-38 (quoting Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168-69).            A\n\ncourt may infer that a condition of confinement is intended as\n\npunishment if it is not reasonably related to a legitimate government\n\nobjective. See id. at 539.\n\n     The complaint alleges, among other things, that MDC staff placed\n\nthe Plaintiff in solitary confinement, deliberately subjected him to\n\nextreme hot and cold temperatures, shackled him every time he left his\n\ncell, and repeatedly subjected him to strip and body-cavity searches,\n\nand that these conditions were intended to be, and were in fact,\n\npunitive.     Applying Wolfish, Judge Gleeson found these allegations\n\nsufficient to state a substantive due process claim, observing that\n\nwhether     the   conditions   were    reasonably    related   to   legitimate\n\ngovernment objectives could not be determined on a motion to dismiss.\n\nSee Dist. Ct. op. at *16.\n\n     Hasty contends that Judge Gleeson did not properly consider\n\nwhether the Plaintiff alleged that he was “deprived of the minimal\n\ncivilized    measure   of   life’s    necessities”   or   whether   Hasty   was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to the Plaintiff’s health or safety.               But\n\nthis Court has never applied those standards in this context.                In\n\nBenjamin II, we distinguished between challenges to disabilities\n\nimposed purposefully on pretrial detainees, which are analyzed under\n\nthe Wolfish “punitive” inquiry, and pretrial detainees’ challenges to\n\nprison environmental conditions. See 343 F.3d at 50. Recognizing that\n\nthe “punitive” standard is neither required nor helpful in the context\n\n                                      -53-\n\fof environmental conditions, we adopted a modified version of the\n\nEighth Amendment’s deliberate indifference standard; we required a\n\nshowing of deliberate indifference but stated that such indifference\n\ncould be presumed from an absence of reasonable care. See id.                We\n\nexplicitly rejected analogies to the Eighth Amendment that would\n\nrequire a showing of wantonness on the part of the prison official,\n\nsee id. at 51, or a showing that the alleged conditions were so\n\ninhumane as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment, see id. at 52\n\n(citing Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (1976)).\n\n      The Plaintiff has alleged the purposeful infliction of restraints\n\nthat were punitive in nature.        Accordingly, the District Court need\n\nnot have considered whether a Defendant was “deliberately indifferent”\n\nin inflicting the restraints or whether the restraints constituted\n\ncruel and unusual punishment.       The right of pretrial detainees to be\n\nfree from punitive restraints was clearly established at the time of\n\nthe events in question, and no reasonable officer could have thought\n\nthat he could punish a pretrial detainee by subjecting him to the\n\npractices and conditions alleged by the Plaintiff.\n\n      The Plaintiff alleges that Hasty (1) requested that certain\n\nofficials develop procedures for the ADMAX SHU, (2) knew of the\n\nconditions of confinement to which Plaintiff was subjected, (3)\n\napproved the strip search policy, and (4) knew or should have known of\n\nthe practice or custom of beating detainees. Under a notice pleading\n\nstandard, reaffirmed in Bell Atlantic and Erickson, these allegations\n\nare   sufficient   to   state   a   claim   that   Hasty   failed   to   remedy\n\n\n                                     -54-\n\fconstitutional violations of which he was aware.       Moreover, the\n\ngeneral allegations of knowledge, which are sufficient under Phelps,\n\ncited above, see Part I(e), are bolstered by the allegation that Hasty\n\ndirected other officers to set up procedures for the ADMAX SHU.\n\n     Hasty’s final argument is that, even if the Plaintiff has pled\n\nthe violation of a clearly established right, Hasty’s actions were\n\nobjectively reasonable in the post-9/11 context.   He argues that the\n\nactions were taken “in the immediate aftermath of September 11th\n\nduring the course of a large-scale investigation of unprecedented\n\nscope in United States history, and Plaintiff was, at that time,\n\nconsidered to be possibly complicit in the terrorist acts.”        As\n\ndiscussed above, see Part I(f), the post-9/11 context does not lessen\n\nthe Plaintiff’s right, as a pretrial detainee, to be free of punitive\n\nconditions of confinement.\n\nIV. Excessive Force\n\n     The only argument of a Defendant directed to the claim of\n\nexcessive force is Hasty’s contention that the complaint does not\n\nallege his personal involvement.\n\n     The complaint alleges that Hasty knew or should have known of the\n\nMDC practice of beating detainees in the ADMAX SHU, that he knew or\n\nshould have known of the propensity of his subordinates to beat the\n\nPlaintiff unnecessarily, and that he was deliberately indifferent in\n\nfailing to take action to curtail the beatings.    The complaint also\n\nalleges that Hasty chose the officers who worked in the ADMAX SHU.\n\n     Applying the standards for supervisory liability, outlined above,\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fsee Part I(d), the Plaintiff’s allegations, on a notice pleading\n\nstandard, see Part I(e), suffice to state a claim of supervisory\n\nliability for the use of excessive force against the Plaintiff.            See\n\nPhelps, 308 F.3d at 187 n.6 (“[A] plaintiff’s allegation of knowledge\n\nis itself a particularized factual allegation, which he will have the\n\nopportunity to demonstrate at the appropriate time in the usual ways.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).            The plausibility standard\n\nrequires no subsidiary facts at the pleading stage to support an\n\nallegation of Hasty’s knowledge because it is at least plausible that\n\na warden would know of mistreatment inflicted by those under his\n\ncommand.   Whether such knowledge can be proven must await further\n\nproceedings.\n\nV. Interference with Right to Counsel\n\n      Hasty argues that the Plaintiff did not adequately plead a\n\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel because (1) the\n\ncomplaint does not state that he was charged with criminal (as opposed\n\nto immigration) offenses and (2) he failed to plead supervisory\n\ninvolvement.      Although, as Judge Gleeson observed, “the complaint\n\ncould have been more transparent regarding plaintiffs’ status as\n\npretrial detainees facing criminal charges,” see Dist. Ct. op. at *23,\n\nthe   complaint    does   refer   to   interference   with   the   Plaintiff’s\n\nconversations with his “criminal attorney.”            This allegation was\n\nsufficient to give Hasty “fair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is\n\nand the grounds upon which it rests.” Conley, 355 U.S. at 47.           As for\n\nthe issue of supervisory liability, the complaint alleges that Hasty\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\f“knew of and condoned the imposition of substantial restrictions on\n\nPlaintiff’s right to communicate with counsel.”            The Plaintiff’s\n\nallegations   of   knowledge   are    sufficient   to   state   a   claim   of\n\nsupervisory liability, and, for the reasons stated above, satisfy the\n\nplausibility standard without an allegation of subsidiary facts.\n\nVI. Unreasonable Searches\n\n     Hasty challenges Judge Gleeson’s conclusion that he is not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity at this stage on the Plaintiff’s Fourth\n\nAmendment claim on the grounds that (1) the law on prisoners’ Fourth\n\nAmendment right to be free from strip and body-cavity searches was not\n\nclearly established and (2) Judge Gleeson failed to explain why the\n\nsearches of the     Plaintiff did not serve legitimate penological\n\ninterests.\n\n     As to whether the right to be free from strip and body-cavity\n\nsearches was clearly established, Hasty argues that “the Circuits\n\ndiffer sharply on the existence of prisoner privacy rights under the\n\nFourth Amendment outside of prison cells.” This argument ignores the\n\nfact that it is this Circuit’s law that determines whether a right is\n\nclearly established for purposes of a qualified immunity defense, see\n\nTellier, 280 F.3d at 84, and Hasty does not reckon with the long line\n\nof Second Circuit cases on strip and body-cavity searches in prisons\n\nand jails.

Ellison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775758\"><a href=\"/opinion/775758/ray-e-shain-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-john-ellison-shield/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 2001);\n\nCovino v.

See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558.          Emphasizing that the\n\nFourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches, the Court\n\ninstructed judges to consider “the scope of the particular intrusion,\n\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating\n\nit, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 558-59.           Because\n\nof the potential for smuggling money, drugs, and weapons into prisons,\n\nthe Court concluded that the practice of strip searching inmates after\n\ncontact visits was not facially unconstitutional. See id. at 559-60.\n\nApplying Wolfish, this Court has concluded that, while it might be\n\nreasonable to strip search a prisoner before initially placing him in\n\nadministrative detention, it would not be reasonable to conduct a\n\nsecond strip search shortly after the first search if the prisoner was\n\nunder continuous escort the entire time.

By limiting Covino to prison\n\nregulations, she reconciled Covino and the “reasonable suspicion” line\n\nof cases beginning with Weber, which all concerned events occurring in\n\njails.

Ct. op. at *26, that the proper inquiry is whether the Plaintiff\n\nwas housed at a jail or a prison.        Finding that the MDC was most like\n\na prison, Judge Gleeson applied the Covino/Turner standard. See id.\n\nThis was correct.    The Plaintiff was confined for an extended period\n\nof time in a prison-like environment, and it appears that he was\n\ncharged with felonies, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1028. In the environment\n\nwhere the Plaintiff was held, the lesser reasonable suspicion standard\n\nwould jeopardize prison officials’ ability to maintain security.\n\n     As    Judge Gleeson recognized, even if the precise standard\n\ngoverning intrusive searches of the Plaintiff at the MDC might not\n\nhave been clearly established in 2001, it was clearly established that\n\neven the standard most favorable to prison officials required that\n\nstrip and body-cavity searches be rationally related to legitimate\n\ngovernment purposes. Cf. Hodges, 712 F.2d at 35 (holding that a\n\nplaintiff stated a Fourth Amendment claim where consecutive body-\n\ncavity searches were unnecessary).         The complaint alleges that the\n\nPlaintiff was routinely strip searched twice after returning from the\n\nmedical clinic or court and that, on one occasion, the Plaintiff was\n\nsubjected to three serial strip and body-cavity searches in the same\n\nroom.   He also alleges that he was subjected to strip and body-cavity\n\nsearches    every   morning.     These    allegations   may   reasonably   be\n\nunderstood to claim that repeated strip and body-cavity searches were\n\nunrelated to legitimate government purposes and apparently were\n\nperformed to punish.           The Plaintiff has adequately alleged a\n\nviolation of his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.              Of\n\n\n                                    -61-\n\fcourse, the success or failure of these claims will turn on the\n\nspecific facts that are revealed after discovery or at trial.\n\n     Although exigent circumstances can justify some conduct that\n\nwould otherwise violate Fourth Amendment standards, see, e.g., Tyler,\n\n436 U.S. at 509 (exigent circumstances justify warrantless entry into\n\na home), the post-9/11 context does not provide a basis for conducting\n\nrepeated and needless strip and body-cavity searches of a pretrial\n\ndetainee. See Part I(f), above.\n\nVII. Interference with Religious Practices\n\n     Hasty also argues that Judge Gleeson should have dismissed the\n\nPlaintiff’s First Amendment claim against him on qualified immunity\n\ngrounds because (1) BOP regulations “conclusively establish” a lack of\n\npersonal involvement and (2) the Plaintiff did not allege a violation\n\nof his First Amendment rights.\n\n     Both arguments lack merit. Hasty contends that the only “policy”\n\non religion at the MDC was the official BOP policy, codified at 28\n\nC.F.R. part 548, and that the Plaintiff has not indicated that these\n\npolicies were suspended or that he availed himself of available\n\ncomplaint procedures, see 28 C.F.R. part 542. Hasty contends that he\n\n“was under no clearly established constitutional obligation to take\n\naffirmative steps to inquire whether Plaintiff observed particular\n\nreligious practices, but as the BOP regulations instruct, Plaintiff\n\nhad the responsibility to make his religious preferences known.” Br.\n\nfor Hasty at 47.     But neither the complaint procedures nor the\n\nofficial policy governing religion allowed Hasty to ignore violations\n\n\n                                  -62-\n\fof detainees’ First Amendment rights.    If Hasty is arguing that the\n\nPlaintiff has forfeited his right to recover damages because he did\n\nnot follow administrative complaint procedures, this may be relevant\n\nto the merits of the case, but it is not relevant to a qualified\n\nimmunity defense.\n\n     Similarly without merit, Hasty argues that he could not be\n\npersonally involved in any deprivations of religious freedom because\n\nBOP regulations establish that prison chaplains “are responsible for\n\nmanaging religious activities within the institution.” 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 548.12.   As the Plaintiff points out, however, Hasty ignores other\n\nregulations stating that the warden determines, among other things,\n\nwhat religious items may be used by prisoners, see id. § 548.16, and\n\nwhether attendance at religious functions is open to all prisoners,\n\nid. § 548.15.\n\n     Hasty’s second argument is that Plaintiff has not alleged a\n\nviolation of his First Amendment rights.      He relies on O’Lone v.\n\nEstate of Shabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), which applied Turner’s\n\n“legitimate penological interests” test to First Amendment claims, see\n\nid. at 348-49. Though recognizing that a prison regulation precluded\n\nsome Muslim prisoners from attending Friday prayers, see id. at 345,\n\nthe Supreme Court found the regulation justified under Turner,\n\nfocusing on the     officials’ legitimate security objectives and the\n\navailability of other channels by which prisoners could exercise their\n\nreligious rights, see id. at 350-53.    In the pending case, however,\n\nthe Plaintiff alleges that he was not allowed to attend Friday\n\n\n                                 -63-\n\fprayers, that prison guards banged on his door when he tried to pray,\n\nand that his Koran was routinely confiscated.11                These allegations\n\nsuffice to preclude a qualified immunity defense at this stage of the\n\nlitigation.      In particular, consideration of Hasty’s arguments--that\n\n“restrictions on movement and possessions . . . were a necessary part\n\nof the legitimate and proper functioning of the maximum security\n\nprocedures      in   the   ADMAX   SHU”    and   that   such   restrictions     were\n\n“justified by security concerns and other institutional needs,” Br.\n\nfor   Hasty     at   49-50--must    await    factual    discovery   so   that    the\n\nGovernment’s asserted security interests can be assessed against a\n\nfactual record of what restrictions actually existed and what purpose\n\nthey served.\n\nVIII. Racial and Religious Discrimination\n\n      The Defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity\n\non the Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination\n\nand Fifth Amendment claim of racial or ethnic discrimination on three\n\ngrounds: (1) the Plaintiff has failed to state a violation of clearly\n\nestablished rights, (2) the Plaintiff’s allegations of discriminatory\n\nintent are too conclusory, and (3) the Plaintiff has not alleged the\n\npersonal involvement of Ashcroft and Mueller.12\n\n      11\n           Hasty’s arguments that the repeated banging on Iqbal’s cell\n\nwhile he prayed shows that he was at least allowed to pray, and that\n\nthe repeated confiscation of his Koran shows that he was at least\n\npermitted to have a Koran need no response.\n      12\n           Judge Gleeson dismissed the discrimination claims against the\n\n                                          -64-\n\f       The arguments of Ashcroft and Mueller challenging the sufficiency\n\nof the Plaintiff’s race, ethnic, and religious discrimination claims\n\nmisunderstand his complaint. They contend that his “complaint amounts\n\nto an objection that most of those persons determined to be of high\n\ninterest to the 9/11 investigation were Muslim or from certain Arab\n\ncountries,” which they justify by pointing out that the 9/11 hijackers\n\nwere Muslims from Arab countries.               However, what the Plaintiff is\n\nalleging   is   that    he   was    deemed     to   be       “of   high    interest,”      and\n\naccordingly was kept in the ADMAX SHU under harsh conditions, solely\n\nbecause of his race, ethnicity, and religion.                       The Plaintiff also\n\nalleges that “Defendants specifically targeted [him] for mistreatment\n\nbecause    of   [his]    race,     religion,    and      national         origin.”       These\n\nallegations     are     sufficient     to    state       a    claim       of    animus-based\n\ndiscrimination        that   any    “reasonably          competent         officer”      would\n\nunderstand to have been illegal under prior case law. See Malley, 475\n\nU.S. at 341; see also Hayden v. County of Nassau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764768\"><a href=\"/opinion/764768/william-hayden-v-county-of-nassau-united-states-of-america-and-nassau/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (2d\n\nCir.   1999)    (stating     that    racial     classifications                violate   Equal\n\nProtection Clause where motivated by racial animus and having a\n\ndiscriminatory effect). Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s racial, ethnic,\n\nand religious discrimination claims cannot be dismissed on qualified\n\nimmunity grounds at this stage of the litigation.\n\n       Hasty also argues that the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim\n\nof discrimination.       Citing Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination\n\nCommittee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999) (“AAADC”), he argues that the Equal\n\n\nBOP Defendants. See Dist. Ct. op. at *29.\n\n                                        -65-\n\fProtection Clause does not apply in the context of proceedings to\n\nremove illegal aliens and that the Government can permissibly deem\n\nnationals of a particular country to be a special threat.               In AAADC,\n\nthe   Supreme    Court   concluded   that   a   provision    of   the    Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(g), deprived the federal courts of jurisdiction to consider an\n\nillegal alien’s selective enforcement challenge to deportation. See\n\n525 U.S. at 487. The Court rejected the argument that it nevertheless\n\nhad jurisdiction to consider an alien’s constitutional arguments,\n\nholding   that    “an    alien   unlawfully     in   this   country      has   no\n\nconstitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense\n\nagainst his deportation,” see id. at 488, even when the Government\n\ndeports the alien “for the additional reason that it believes him to\n\nbe a member of an organization that supports terrorist activity,” id.\n\nat 492. AAADC affords the Defendants no relief. The Plaintiff is not\n\nchallenging his deportation or even his arrest on criminal charges.\n\nMoreover, AAADC does not stand for the proposition that the Government\n\nmay subject members of a particular race, ethnicity, or religion to\n\nmore restrictive conditions of confinement than members of other\n\nraces, ethnic backgrounds, or religions.\n\n      The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff’s allegations of racial,\n\nethnic, and religious animus are too conclusory.            But, as discussed\n\nabove, see Part I(e), Crawford-El indicates that courts cannot require\n\na heightened pleading standard for civil rights complaints involving\n\nimproper motive. In Phillip, 316 F.3d at 298-99, this Court held that\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\fSwierkiewicz’s notice pleading standard applied to a civil rights\n\ncomplaint alleging racial animus.       Although recognizing that the\n\ncomplaint did not “contain many evidentiary allegations relevant to\n\nintent,” see id. at 299, we found the allegations sufficient to state\n\na claim, observing that the complaint alleged that the plaintiffs were\n\nAfrican-American, described the defendants’ actions in detail, and\n\nalleged that the plaintiffs were selected for maltreatment “solely\n\nbecause of their color,” id. at 298.\n\n     The Plaintiff’s allegations suffice to state claims of racial,\n\nethnic, and religious discrimination.    He alleges in particular that\n\nthe FBI Defendants classified him “of high interest” solely because of\n\nhis race, ethnic background, and religion and not because of any\n\nevidence of involvement in terrorism.     He offers additional factual\n\nsupport for this allegation, stating that “within the New York area,\n\nall Arab Muslim men arrested on criminal or immigration charges while\n\nthe FBI was following an investigative lead into the September 11th\n\nattacks--however unrelated the arrestee was to the investigation--were\n\nimmediately classified as ‘of interest’ to the post-September 11th\n\ninvestigation.”   We need not consider at this stage of the litigation\n\nwhether these allegations are alone sufficient to state a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional violation under the circumstances presented\n\nbecause they are sufficient to state a violation when combined with\n\nthe Plaintiff’s allegation that he was singled out for mistreatment\n\nand for unnecessarily punitive conditions of confinement based on his\n\nracial, ethnic, and religious characteristics.\n\n\n                                 -67-\n\f      Finally, Ashcroft and Mueller argue that the Plaintiff failed to\n\nallege their personal involvement in any discrimination. However, the\n\ncomplaint alleges broadly that Ashcroft and Mueller were instrumental\n\nin adopting the “policies and practices challenged here.”                          The\n\ncomplaint also alleges that the FBI, “under the direction of Defendant\n\nMueller,” arrested thousands of Arab Muslims and that Ashcroft and\n\nMueller “knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to\n\nsubject Plaintiff[] to these conditions of confinement as a matter of\n\npolicy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national\n\norigin and for no legitimate penological interest.”                   The Plaintiff\n\nacknowledges that the FBI Defendants made the determination that\n\nPlaintiff was “of high interest,” but this allegation does not\n\nnecessarily insulate Ashcroft and Mueller from personal responsibility\n\nfor   the   actions    of   their   subordinates       under    the    standards   of\n\nsupervisory liability outlined above, see Part I(d).                    As with the\n\nprocedural due process claim, the allegation that Ashcroft and Mueller\n\ncondoned and agreed to the discrimination that the Plaintiff alleges\n\nsatisfies    the    plausibility     standard    without       an     allegation    of\n\nsubsidiary facts because of the likelihood that these senior officials\n\nwould   have       concerned   themselves       with     the     formulation       and\n\nimplementation of policies dealing with the confinement of those\n\narrested on federal charges in the New York City area and designated\n\n“of high interest” in the aftermath of 9/11.                   Whether or not the\n\nissues of personal involvement will be clarified by court-supervised\n\ndiscovery sufficient to support summary                judgment remains to be\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\fdetermined.\n\nIX. Section 1985(3) Conspiracy\n\n     The Defendants contend that they are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity on the Plaintiff’s conspiracy claims under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1985(3) because (1) it was not clearly established that federal\n\nofficials were subject to liability under section 1985(3), and (2) the\n\nPlaintiff’s allegations of conspiracy are too conclusory to state a\n\nviolation of clearly established law.\n\n     Clearly established law.    A conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1985(3) has four elements: (1) a conspiracy, (2) for the purpose of\n\ndepriving any person or class of persons of the equal protection of\n\nthe laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws, (3) an\n\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) whereby a person is\n\ninjured in his person or property or deprived of a right or privilege\n\nof a citizen.

The Court first held that\n\nthe officials had absolute immunity from the false arrest claim. See\n\nid. at 580-81.    Turning to the section 1985(3) claim, the Court\n\nrejected the plaintiff’s argument that “this language creates a claim\n\nagainst any two persons who conspire to injure another for spite or\n\n\n                                 -69-\n\fother improper motives, apparently because to single out anyone for\n\nillegal aggression is to deny him equal protection of the laws.” Id.\n\nat 581.

Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781277\"><a href=\"/opinion/781277/robert-i-toussie-and-david-park-estates-inc-v-john-powell-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n“Whether issues are inextricably intertwined is determined by whether\n\nthere is substantial factual overlap bearing on the issues raised.”\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Gleeson recognized the\n\noverlap between the Defendants’ personal jurisdiction arguments and\n\npersonal involvement arguments pertaining to qualified immunity. See\n\nDist. Ct. op. at *10.\n\n     Under    New   York’s   long-arm   statute,   a   court   may   exercise\n\njurisdiction over a non-domiciliary who “in person or through an agent\n\n. . . commits a tortious act within the state” so long as the cause of\n\naction arises from that act. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(2).            As the\n\nDistrict Court observed, see Dist. Ct. op. at *9-*10, personal\n\njurisdiction cannot be predicated solely on a defendant’s supervisory\n\nposition.    See Ontel Products, Inc. v. Project Strategies Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1670774\"><a href=\"/opinion/1670774/ontel-products-inc-v-project-strategies-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Rather, a plaintiff must show\n\nthat a defendant “personally took part in the activities giving rise\n\nto the action at issue.” Id.\n\n     The same intertwining of the issue of personal involvement with\n\n\n                                   -72-\n\fthe issue of personal jurisdiction that provides us with pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction also demonstrates that the pleading of personal\n\ninvolvement suffices to establish personal jurisdiction, at least at\n\nthis preliminary stage of the litigation.\n\n                             Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the order of the District Court is\n\naffirmed as to the denial of the Defendants’ motions to dismiss all of\n\nthe Plaintiff’s claims, except for the claim of a violation of the\n\nright to procedural due process, as to which we reverse. In affirming\n\nalmost all of the District Court’s ruling, we emphasize that we do so\n\nat an early stage of the litigation.      We recognize, as did Judge\n\nGleeson in ruling on the Plaintiff’s procedural due process claim, see\n\nDist. Ct. op. at *21, that carefully limited and tightly controlled\n\ndiscovery by the Plaintiff as to certain officials will be appropriate\n\nto probe such matters as the Defendants’ personal involvement in\n\nseveral of the alleged deprivations of rights.    We are mindful too\n\nthat, for high level officials, this discovery might be either\n\npostponed until discovery of front-line officials is complete or\n\nsubject to District Court approval and additional limitations.     We\n\nalso recognize that the Defendants will be entitled to seek more\n\nspecific statements as to some of the Plaintiff’s claims and perhaps\n\nrenew their claims for qualified immunity by motions for summary\n\njudgment on a more fully developed record.\n\n     In sum, the serious allegations of gross mistreatment set forth\n\nin the complaint suffice, except as noted in this opinion, to defeat\n\n\n                                -73-\n\fthe Defendants’ attempt to terminate the lawsuit at a preliminary\n\nstage, but, consistent with the important policies that justify the\n\ndefense of qualified immunity, the defense may be reasserted in\n\nadvance of trial after the carefully controlled and limited discovery\n\nthat the District Court expects to supervise.\n\n     Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -74-\n\fJOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n        I concur fully in Judge Newman’s characteristically careful and comprehensive opinion, which seeks\n\nto hew closely to the relevant Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedents, including the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That said, it is worth underscoring that some of\n\nthose precedents are less than crystal clear and fully deserve reconsideration by the Supreme Court at the\n\nearliest opportunity; to say the least, “the guidance they provide is not readily harmonized,” Maj. Op. at 18.\n\n        Most importantly, the opinion’s discussion of the relevant pleading standards reflects the uneasy\n\ncompromise—forged partially in dicta by the Supreme Court in Crawford El v. Britton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1998)—between a qualified immunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve “the effectiveness of\n\ngovernment as contemplated by our constitutional structure,” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 820 n.35\n\n(1982), and the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n        Here, that uneasy compromise presents itself in a case brought by Javaid Iqbal, a federally convicted\n\nfelon now residing in his native Pakistan. Iqbal does not challenge his arrest in the aftermath of 9/11, his\n\ndetention, his conviction, or his apparent subsequent deportation. Iqbal instead challenges his separation\n\nfrom the general prison population at the Metropolitan Detention Center and his treatment during that\n\nseparation. He claims that his separation stemmed from a general policy authorized at the highest levels of\n\ngovernment in the wake of 9/11.           But most, if not all, of the assertedly unlawful actions in his\n\ncomplaint—including the decision to place plaintiff in the ADMAX SHU and the abuses which purportedly\n\nensued there—are alleged to have been carried out by defendants much lower in the chain of command.\n\n        Nevertheless, as a result of the Supreme Court’s precedents interpreting Rule 8(a), even as modified\n\nby the “plausibility standard” established in Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1968, it is possible that the incumbent\n\nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a former Attorney General of the United States will have\n\n                                                      -75-\n\fto submit to discovery, and possibly to a jury trial, regarding Iqbal’s claims. If so, these officials—FBI\n\nDirector Robert Mueller and former Attorney General John Ashcroft —may be required to comply with\n\ninherently onerous discovery requests probing, inter alia, their possible knowledge of actions taken by\n\nsubordinates at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Prisons at a time when\n\nAshcroft and Mueller were trying to cope with a national and international security emergency unprecedented\n\nin the history of the American Republic. In Bell Atlantic, the Supreme Court has quite rightly expressed\n\nconcern that “careful case management” might not be able to “weed[] out early in the discovery process”\n\nan unmeritorious claim in private civil antitrust litigation, see Bell Atlantic, 127 S.Ct. at 1967, and might have\n\nlimited success in “checking discovery abuse,” id. This concern is all the more significant in the context of\n\na lawsuit against, inter alia, federal government officials charged with responsibility for national security and\n\nentitled by law to assert claims of qualified immunity. Even with the discovery safeguards carefully laid out\n\nin Judge Newman’s opinion, it seems that little would prevent other plaintiffs claiming to be aggrieved by\n\nnational security programs and policies of the federal government from following the blueprint laid out by\n\nthis lawsuit to require officials charged with protecting our nation from future attacks to submit to prolonged\n\nand vexatious discovery processes.\n\n        The decision in this case may be required by the faithful application of the relevant precedents by\n\na court of inferior jurisdiction. But a detached observer may wonder whether the balance struck here\n\nbetween the need to deter unlawful conduct and the dangers of exposing public officials to burdensome\n\nlitigation—a balance compelled by the precedents that bind us—jeopardizes the important policy interest\n\nJustice Stevens aptly described as “a national interest in enabling Cabinet officers with responsibilities in [the\n\nnational security] area to perform their sensitive duties with decisiveness and without potentially ruinous\n\n\n\n\n                                                      -76-\n\fhesitation.” Mitchell v.

Ct. at 1967 has particular resonance where, as here, discovery would not only result in significant cost but would also deplete\n\nthe time and effectiveness of current officials and the personal resources of former officials. Indeed, as Justice Stevens noted,\n\n“[p]ersons of wisdom and honor will hesitate to answer the President’s call to serve in these vital positions if they fear that\n\nvexatious and [in some cases] politically motivated litigation associated with their public decisions will squander their time and\n\nreputation, and sap their personal financial resources when they leave office.” Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 542 (Stevens, J. concurring in\n\nthe judgment); see also Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814 (noting the “danger that fear of being sued will dampen the ardor of all but the most\n\nresolute, or the most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching discharge of their duties” (alteration in original) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                                                  -77-\n\f</pre>",
