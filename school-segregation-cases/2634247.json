McCullough, was convicted of the\n\n1957 kidnapping and murder of seven-year-old Maria Ridulph. He appeals. We affirm in part\n\nand vacate in part.\n\n¶2                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶3                       A. December 3, 1957 Through April 26, 1958\n\n¶4     On December 3, 1957, seven-year-old Maria Ridulph lived with her family on Archie\n\nPlace in Sycamore, Illinois. She was a second-grade student at West School. Her friend Kathy\n\nSigman, who lived four or five houses away from Maria, was eight and attended third grade at\n\nWest School. Defendant, who was 18 years of age in 1957 and was known then as John Tessier,\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nlived with his family at 227 Center Cross Street, approximately a block and a half or two blocks\n\nfrom Maria’s house. Sycamore in the 1950s was described by witnesses as a rural farm town, a\n\nplace where people did not lock their doors.\n\n¶5     The corner of Archie Place and Center Cross Street was a gathering place for the\n\nneighborhood children, where they played games like hide-and-seek. There was a large tree at\n\nthat corner, and the corner was lit by a streetlight. After dinner on the evening of Tuesday,\n\nDecember 3, 1957, Maria and Kathy were allowed to play together at the corner, in the season’s\n\nfirst snow. Maria ate dinner at 5 p.m., and Kathy’s dinnertime was 5:30 p.m. At just before 6\n\np.m., Kathy and Maria arrived at the corner and played “duck-the-cars,” a game where they\n\nwould run behind the large tree to avoid being lit up by the headlights of cars on Center Cross\n\nStreet, which was also known as state Route 23.\n\n¶6     At trial in 2012, Kathy was 63 years old. Her married name was Mary Sigman Chapman,\n\nalthough she still went by her nickname, Kathy. Chapman testified that, as she and Maria were\n\nplaying at the corner of Archie Place and Center Cross Street at 6 p.m. on December 3, 1957, a\n\nman approached them, walking from the south. Chapman testified that it was “very, very dark”\n\noutside but that it was not dark on the corner with the streetlight “shining down.” Chapman\n\ndescribed the man who approached them as having a slender face, a flip in the side of his hair,\n\nand large teeth. On cross-examination, Chapman described the man as an “older person,” which\n\nshe clarified as being, to her eight-year-old self, someone twice as old as she was. According to\n\nChapman, the man, whom she did not know, was slender, maybe 150 pounds, and was wearing a\n\nsweater with a lot of colors in it and jeans.\n\n¶7     Chapman testified that the man introduced himself as “Johnny.” Johnny asked the girls if\n\nthey liked dolls and if they would like a piggyback ride. Maria accepted a piggyback ride, and\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nwhen Johnny and Maria returned to the corner, Maria ran home, three doors away, to get a doll.\n\nAccording to Chapman, she observed Johnny under the streetlight while they waited for Maria to\n\nreturn with her doll. Chapman testified that, after Maria ran back to them with her doll,\n\nChapman went home to get mittens for her cold hands. When Chapman got back to the corner,\n\nMaria should have been there but was not.\n\n¶8     Chapman testified that she went to Maria’s house, thinking that Maria had gone home.\n\nAccording to Chapman, Maria’s brother, Charles, said, “She still must be hiding from you,” and\n\ntold her to keep looking for Maria. Chapman testified that she went back outside to look for\n\nMaria but did not find her. At that time, she went to her own home and told her mother about\n\n“Johnny and Maria.” Her mother called the police. According to Chapman, over the next\n\nseveral months the police and the FBI showed her thousands of photographs and took her to\n\npossibly 20 lineups, but she never identified anyone and was never shown a photograph of\n\n“Johnny.”\n\n¶9     Charles, who was 11 years old in 1957, testified that the family ate dinner promptly at 5\n\np.m. and that he and a friend were listening to records after dinner when Chapman came to the\n\ndoor saying that she could not find Maria. Charles also recalled that Maria’s bedtime was\n\nalways at 8 p.m. and that Maria would be in their mother’s room reading books for a period\n\nleading up to her bedtime. Maria did not come home on the night of December 3, 1957. That\n\nnight and the next day, the town organized a search. Still, Maria was not found over the next\n\ndays, weeks, or months. Then, during the weekend of April 26, 1958, Charles was on a camping\n\ntrip when his parents received a telephone call.\n\n¶ 10   On April 26, 1958, James T. Furlong, a funeral director and the coroner of Jo Daviess\n\nCounty, Illinois, assisted in recovering the remains of a female child from among some timber\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nabout a half mile off Route 20 in Jo Daviess County. Furlong, 88 years old at the time of trial,\n\ntestified that the body was found on the ground and that it had some clothes and one sock on it.\n\nAccording to Furlong, the body was “in bad shape from the length of time [it] was out in the\n\ntimber.” Furlong testified that he took the body to his funeral home in Galena, Illinois. Furlong\n\nidentified People’s exhibit No. 10 as a certified copy of the coroner’s inquest report of the death\n\nof Maria Ridulph, dated June 3, 1958. Without objection, the portion of the report that contained\n\nthe autopsy protocol was introduced into evidence.\n\n¶ 11   The autopsy protocol indicated the following. At 11:30 p.m. on the night of April 26,\n\n1958, Dr. K.M. Truemner conducted the autopsy at the Furlong Funeral Home. Furlong, the\n\nDe Kalb County State’s Attorney, and members of the Illinois State Police and the FBI attended\n\nthe autopsy. The body was identified as Maria’s, from dental records. The body lay in a supine\n\nposition on the mortuary table, partially rotated to the left, with the left hip and knee flexed, the\n\nleft arm extended parallel to the body, and the right arm flexed at the elbow and wrist, lying\n\nacross the lower chest and upper abdomen. The right leg was extended and slightly externally\n\nrotated. According to the autopsy protocol, the body was clad in one pair of brownish-tan ankle-\n\nlength socks, a soiled black and white checked shirt, and a cotton knit undershirt.\n\n¶ 12   Dr. Truemner noted that the body was “complete in the sense of skeletal articulation.”\n\nHe noted extensive soft-tissue loss. However, he also noted that the soft tissues were retained\n\nover the right anterior upper chest, right shoulder girdle, and right upper arm to the elbow. The\n\nskin and soft tissues were intact over the posterior surface of the trunk to the level of the lower\n\nrib margins. The viscera were completely absent. The lungs, heart, esophagus, aorta, and\n\nthoracic soft tissues were completely absent “except for remnants of the upper trachea retracted\n\nupwards into the base of the neck.” With respect to the neck organs, Dr. Truemner stated that\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe soft tissues of the neck, including the larynx, “are shrunken into a tough sclerotic [(rigid)]\n\nmass.” Dr. Truemner stated that “dissection is virtually impossible.” He continued, “It is\n\nimpossible to recognize evidence of laryngeal or hyoid fracture” or evidence of interstitial\n\nbleeding in the soft tissues of the cervical prevertebral space. Dr. Truemner examined the head\n\nand found that the bony surface of the “intact” skull “shows no fracture or penetrating wound.”\n\nDr. Truemner found no fracture of the bony skeleton, “with special attention to the skull and\n\ncervical spine.” The only wounds Dr. Truemner found were the results of “known trauma prior\n\nto the subject’s disappearance,” namely, a laceration of the sole of the left foot and a probable\n\nvaccination scar on the left thigh. As to the cause of death, Dr. Truemner concluded that “I can\n\ndraw no conclusion on this subject.” He elaborated by stating that the poor preservation of the\n\nbody due to the effects of the elements and the ravages of small animals “rendered this doubtful\n\nfrom the outset unless the mechanism had been some form of obvious, gross, mechanical\n\ntrauma.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 13   Maria was buried in May 1958. The case went cold for the next 50 years.\n\n¶ 14                                 B. 2008 Through 2012\n\n¶ 15   In October 2008, the Illinois State Police began investigating Maria’s disappearance, as a\n\nresult of information supplied by defendant’s half-sister, Janet Tessier.        As part of the\n\ninvestigation, Special Agent Brion Hanley first spoke with Chapman on September 1, 2010, for\n\napproximately an hour and a half. At that meeting, according to Chapman, Hanley asked if she\n\nremembered anything about Maria’s disappearance. Chapman testified that she gave Hanley\n\n“the exact information that I [could] remember back from 1957.” On September 9, 2010, Hanley\n\nshowed Chapman a photo array consisting of six black and white photographs of what appear to\n\nbe teenage males circa the 1950s. All are clean-shaven and smiling, similar in age, with similar\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nhairstyles that might be expected of that era. Chapman identified defendant’s photo as that of the\n\n“Johnny” who gave Maria the piggyback ride on December 3, 1957.\n\n¶ 16   Hanley testified that the photos were obtained from a 1950s yearbook. According to\n\nHanley, he laid the photos down one at a time in front of Chapman. Gradually, Chapman\n\neliminated every photo except number four, which was defendant’s photo. According to Hanley,\n\nChapman picked out number four and said, “That is him.” The photo shows a young man with a\n\nslender face, hair worn short on the sides and longer on top, and prominent teeth.\n\n¶ 17    On June 29, 2011, Sycamore police officers, accompanied by Seattle police officers,\n\nexecuted a search warrant at defendant’s Seattle, Washington, residence. Sycamore sergeant\n\nSteven Cook testified that, while he was in defendant’s residence, he saw defendant’s wife open\n\na safe. Inside the safe was a box of ammunition. According to Sergeant Cook, the fact that\n\ndefendant’s wife opened the safe was never released to the public. On July 1, 2011, an arrest\n\nwarrant was issued for defendant, and extradition proceedings were initiated.\n\n¶ 18   On July 27, 2011, defendant was extradited to Illinois. That same day, Maria’s body was\n\nexhumed and a second autopsy was performed. On August 19, 2011, a grand jury indicted\n\ndefendant on three counts: count I charged him with Maria’s murder (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 38,\n\n¶ 358); count II charged defendant with kidnapping (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 38, ¶ 384); and\n\ncount III charged defendant with abduction of an infant (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 38, ¶ 385).\n\nCounts II and III of the indictment alleged that the applicable limitations periods were tolled due\n\nto defendant’s absence from Illinois for various periods, commencing on December 11, 1957.\n\n¶ 19                                   C. Pretrial Motions\n\n¶ 20   Defendant filed a motion in limine requesting that certain FBI reports that were created\n\nduring the 1957 investigation be admitted on the basis that they contained exculpatory evidence,\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nspecifically evidence of an alibi that had otherwise disappeared due to the witnesses’ deaths.\n\nThe first report reflected that defendant was known as John Samuel Cherry and that the authors\n\nof the report referred to him as “Cherry.”\n\n¶ 21   The first report indicates that the information it contained was received by the FBI via a\n\ntelephone interview on December 10, 1957, with Air Force staff sergeant Jon Oswald. The\n\nreport states that Oswald advised the FBI of the following information, which Oswald had\n\nobtained directly from Cherry. Cherry had been sent to Chicago on December 2, 1957, for a\n\nphysical examination and was rejected by the Air Force because of a spot on his lung. Cherry\n\nstayed over in Chicago and was reexamined on the morning of December 3, 1957, and was again\n\nrejected for the same reason. The Air Force gave Cherry a train ticket to Rockford. At this\n\npoint, Oswald broke off the narrative of what Cherry told him to state his own opinion that\n\nfurnishing a train ticket was a “highly irregular procedure.” Oswald further stated that he\n\ntelephonically contacted “Chicago” to verify Cherry’s story. According to Oswald, he learned\n\nthat the ticket was furnished by the Army Reserve unit located on Van Buren Street, but “no\n\nverification of the information could be obtained at the time of calling.” Oswald then resumed\n\nthe narrative.   Cherry stayed in Chicago on December 3, 1957, visited some burlesque shows,\n\nand then took the 5:15 p.m. train to Rockford, arriving at 6:45 p.m. In Rockford, Cherry\n\ncontacted Colonel Liberwitz of the Air Force Reserve at approximately 7:15 p.m. or 7:30 p.m.\n\nand told Liberwitz that he had been instructed to report to the recruiting office in Rockford.\n\n¶ 22   At this point, the report indicates that Oswald related to the FBI the following\n\nconversation between Oswald and Liberwitz. Liberwitz found Cherry’s story hard to believe,\n\nbecause it was known that the recruiting office was not open in the evening. Cherry gave\n\nLiberwitz the appearance of being a “narcotic,” and Cherry said that he was rejected by the Air\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nForce because he was “unstable.” Liberwitz directed Cherry to contact Technical Sergeant\n\nFroom on the third floor of the recruiting office.\n\n¶ 23   Here, the report indicates that Oswald related his conversation with Froom. Cherry\n\nappeared “bewildered” and looked and acted like a “lost sheep.” Cherry said that he was going\n\nto contact his father to come to Rockford to get him.\n\n¶ 24   Oswald related to the FBI that on December 4, 1957, Cherry returned to the recruiting\n\noffice in Rockford, where Oswald met Cherry for the first time. The following is Oswald’s\n\naccount of that meeting. Cherry mentioned that it was a good thing that he was not in Sycamore\n\nthe night before when the girl disappeared. No details of the disappearance were discussed\n\nexcept for the fact that there had been search parties looking for the girl. Cherry stated that he\n\nwould not be considered a suspect, because his girlfriend’s father was a deputy sheriff. Cherry\n\nhad a “little black book” containing the names and addresses of girls in Sycamore with their bust\n\nand hip sizes. Cherry was wearing an “odd colored flashy” shirt with a string necktie. Cherry\n\nwas not wearing a hat but was wearing a brown jacket. Oswald noted a “slight cut” across\n\nCherry’s upper lip that appeared to be fresh and could have occurred while shaving.\n\n¶ 25   Another FBI report contained the following information pertinent to a possible alibi. On\n\nDecember 8, 1957, defendant’s stepfather, Ralph Tessier, reported that he had discussed with his\n\nwife, Eileen Tessier, that defendant might fall under suspicion because defendant fit the general\n\ndescription of the perpetrator. Ralph reported that defendant was in Rockford at the Air Force\n\nrecruiting office on the evening of December 3, 1957, and had placed a collect call from\n\nRockford to the Tessier home in Sycamore at about 7:10 p.m. Ralph further reported that\n\ndefendant had been in Chicago on the Monday preceding December 3, 1957, and was rejected by\n\nthe Air Force because of a spot on his lung.\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 26   A third FBI report touching upon a possible alibi indicated that Eileen, defendant’s\n\nmother, was interviewed on December 8, 1957, and said that defendant had called home collect\n\nfrom Rockford at 7:10 p.m. on the evening of December 3, 1957, and that Ralph had gone to\n\nRockford to pick up defendant that evening. A fourth report indicated that the general manager\n\nof the Sycamore-Ogle Telephone Company reported that his records reflected that a collect call\n\nwas placed from a certain number in Rockford on December 3, 1957, at approximately 6:57 p.m.\n\nto a number in Sycamore listed to Ralph E. Tessier. The records further revealed that the collect\n\ncall was made by one “John S. Tassier” and that the call lasted until 6:59 p.m. The general\n\nmanager told the FBI that he thought the operator who handled the call had misspelled the name\n\n“Tessier.”\n\n¶ 27   Defendant sought admission of the FBI reports either as ancient documents or as public\n\nrecords, arguing an exception to the rule that police reports are not admissible, because, in this\n\ncase, the defendant rather than the prosecution was seeking their admission. Defendant also\n\nargued that due process required their admission where all of his alibi witnesses were deceased\n\nafter the passage of 55 years. The court denied defendant’s motion to introduce the FBI reports.\n\n¶ 28   The State filed a motion in limine to bar defendant from introducing a former Sycamore\n\npolice lieutenant’s theory that someone other than defendant committed the crime. As the\n\nfortieth anniversary of Maria’s disappearance approached in 1997, Lieutenant Patrick J. Solar\n\npenned a document entitled “Report on the Closure of the Maria Ridulph Kidnap/Murder Case.”\n\nIn the document, Solar opined that a man suspected in a 1951 Pennsylvania murder was “far and\n\naway” the best suspect in the Ridulph case. The suspect, one William Henry Redmond, died in\n\n1992. In the document, Solar stated that the facts of the Pennsylvania case coupled with other\n\nfacts “create a level of certainty that [Redmond] is responsible for [Maria’s] abduction which is\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ngreater than mere suspicion.” In the next paragraph, Solar stated, “We will never know for\n\ncertain if Redmond was responsible for the crime.” At the time of trial, Solar was alive and\n\ncould have testified to what was contained in his document. The trial court granted the State’s\n\nmotion to bar and ruled that Solar’s testimony would have been speculative and remote.\n\n¶ 29   In another motion in limine, the State requested that a 1994 deathbed statement made by\n\nEileen be admitted as a statement against her penal interest. At the time of trial, Eileen was\n\ndeceased. According to the State’s motion, Eileen made the following statement to her daughter\n\nJanet allegedly regarding defendant’s involvement in Maria’s murder: “Those two little girls, one\n\ndisappeared, John did it.” The State contended that, when Eileen made that statement, she\n\nexposed herself to criminal liability, because she had given prior contrary statements to the\n\npolice and the FBI. The court granted the State’s motion to admit the statement as a statement\n\nagainst Eileen’s penal interest.\n\n¶ 30                                   D. The Trial\n\n¶ 31   At trial, Charles and Chapman testified as recounted above. The State also introduced\n\nevidence of the recovery of Maria’s body and the first autopsy as recounted above. In order to\n\nkeep the narrative of the events as chronological as possible, we resume here with the evidence\n\nsurrounding the evening of December 3, 1957, in Sycamore following Maria’s disappearance.\n\n¶ 32   In December 1957, Cheryl Crain was a sophomore at Sycamore High School. After\n\ndinner on December 3, 1957, Crain and her friend Janice Edwards went to Edwards’ father’s\n\nhobby shop in Sycamore to decorate it for Christmas. According to Crain, defendant, who was\n\nEdwards’ boyfriend, was supposed to give Crain a ride home when they finished decorating the\n\nshop. While the girls were decorating, Crain heard police loudspeakers and “knew something\n\nwas going on.” Then Crain’s father called and told her to lock the shop door. Shortly thereafter,\n\n\n\n                                             - 10 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nCrain’s father came to get her and Edwards. Crain testified that she did not see defendant that\n\nnight and that he did not call the shop.\n\n¶ 33   Dennis Twadell lived in Sycamore and was a friend of defendant’s in 1957. According to\n\nTwadell, defendant had a 1948 coupe. Twadell recalled that the coupe was “battleship gray” and\n\nthat defendant would not allow anyone else to drive it. Twadell described defendant in 1957 as\n\nabout 6 feet tall, 150 to 160 pounds, with sandy blond hair worn short. According to Twadell, in\n\nthe winter defendant wore flannel shirts and sweaters.           Twadell testified that defendant’s\n\nsweaters were solid colors or multicolored. Twadell testified that, on the evening of December\n\n3, 1957, he learned from members of his church that Maria was missing and that people were\n\nforming search parties. He testified that he called defendant, who was not at home. Twadell did\n\nnot see defendant that night.      On cross-examination, Twadell admitted that, when he was\n\ninterviewed by the police in 2010, he had no recollection of anything unusual occurring on\n\nDecember 3, 1957, until the police refreshed his recollection.\n\n¶ 34   Katheran Caulfield was known as Katheran Tessier in 1957. Defendant is her half-\n\nbrother. Besides Caulfield and defendant, there were five other siblings plus her parents, Ralph\n\nand Eileen, living at their house, which she described as a “small house” on Center Cross Street\n\nin Sycamore. Caulfield testified that defendant slept on the first floor and that the girls slept in a\n\nconverted attic on the second floor. According to Caulfield, in 1957 defendant was just under 6\n\nfeet tall and “kind of gangly” with wavy hair. She described him as having “like a do-up hairdo\n\non the top.” According to Caulfield, defendant “frequently” wore a multicolored sweater that\n\ntheir mother had knit for him. Caulfield testified that she never saw that sweater again after\n\nDecember 3, 1957.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 35   Caulfield testified that she knew Maria because it was a small neighborhood and all of\n\nthe children played together, although Maria had never come over to the Tessier home.\n\nAccording to Caulfield, because defendant was so much older, he never played with Maria.\n\n¶ 36   Caulfield testified that her father drove her home from a 4-H gathering in De Kalb,\n\nIllinois, at 7 p.m. on December 3, 1957. Caulfield testified that they drove into Sycamore and\n\nsaw a lot of police cars with flashing lights close to Center Cross Street and that there were\n\npeople “outside everywhere walking and looking.” Caulfield testified that she went directly into\n\nher house and that her mother, her sister Jeanne, and her brother Bob were home. According to\n\nCaulfield, her mother and father were “very upset” and went out to search for Maria, while she,\n\nJeanne, and Bob stayed in the living room, with the front door locked. Caulfield testified that the\n\nside door to the house did not lock, so her father secured it with a piece of plywood. According\n\nto Caulfield, by the time she went to bed at 11:30 p.m. or 11:45 p.m., defendant had not come\n\nhome. She testified that she had not seen defendant for “probably” the prior couple of days.\n\n¶ 37   Caulfield testified that Eileen was interviewed by the FBI on December 4, 1957. The\n\ntrial court admitted Caulfield’s description of the conversation because the conversation\n\npertained to Eileen’s deathbed declaration. According to Caulfield, she and Jeanne were present\n\nin the living room for the conversation. Caulfield testified that the FBI agents asked Eileen\n\nabout defendant’s whereabouts the previous evening, December 3, 1957, and that Eileen told the\n\nagents that defendant was home. Caulfield testified that she knew that defendant was not home\n\nthe previous evening.\n\n¶ 38   Caulfield next testified about summer day trips that her family, including defendant, took\n\nevery year. She testified that typical trips would be to Starved Rock State Park or to the Apple\n\nRiver in the Galena area.\n\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 39   Caulfield also testified that in 1957 defendant had a 1940s two-passenger “grayish-\n\nbeigish” coupe with flames painted on the sides. Caulfield recalled that defendant’s coupe was\n\nnot at the home on December 3, 1957. On cross-examination, she said that defendant was not at\n\nhome when she woke up on December 4, 1957.\n\n¶ 40   Jeanne, also defendant’s half-sister, testified that in 1957 defendant was thin and wore his\n\nhair curly on top and swept back on the sides. She testified that defendant played with other\n\nchildren in the neighborhood in approximately 1952, but not in 1957. According to Jeanne,\n\nMaria had never been to the Tessier home and Jeanne had never been to Maria’s home. She\n\nrecalled that on the evening of December 3, 1957, her father went out searching for Maria, and\n\nher mother went to the armory to help make coffee and sandwiches for the searchers. That\n\nevening, according to Jeanne, defendant was not at home. Jeanne testified that she stayed alone\n\nin the living room that night so that she could let her parents in the front door when they came\n\nhome. She testified that she was asleep when her mother came home in the middle of the night.\n\nAccording to Jeanne, a few days later, she was present when her mother spoke with law\n\nenforcement officers in the living room.      Jeanne testified that the officers asked whether\n\ndefendant came home on the evening of December 3, 1957, and that her mother stated that he\n\ndid. According to Jeanne, defendant was not at home that evening. On cross-examination,\n\nJeanne testified that she did not see defendant on the morning of December 4, 1957, although she\n\nmight have seen him sometime during that day.\n\n¶ 41   Pamela Long had lived with her family in Sycamore in the 1950s. She testified that “Old\n\nMan Tessier,” who had no children living with him, lived north of her home, “in [her] backyard.”\n\nLong recalled that Maria disappeared on the evening of December 3, 1957. She also recalled\n\nthat sometime “way before” Maria’s disappearance, when Long was in grade school, a person\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnamed Johnny had given Long piggyback rides. She described Johnny as tall and thin, with\n\n“blondish-brown hair” that had a “flip” in it and “strange teeth, something funny about his\n\nteeth.” On her last piggyback ride with Johnny, her father caught her and “jerked” her off\n\nJohnny’s back.\n\n¶ 42   At this point in the narrative, we leave the 1950s and go forward to January 1994. Janet\n\ntestified that Eileen was hospitalized with cancer for two weeks before her death in January\n\n1994. According to Janet, the hospitalization occurred because Eileen was pulling out her IVs\n\nand could not be cared for at home. According to Janet, sometime during that hospitalization,\n\nwhen Janet’s sister Mary was present, Janet was sitting at the foot of her mother’s hospital bed\n\nwhen Eileen said, “Janet.” Janet testified that she jumped out of her chair and went close to her\n\nmother. According to Janet, Eileen grabbed her wrist and said, “Those two little girls and the\n\none that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone. You have to tell\n\nsomeone.”\n\n¶ 43   According to Janet, she contacted the Sycamore police and the FBI but nothing\n\nhappened. Then, in 2008, Janet contacted the Illinois State Police and they followed up on her\n\ninformation.\n\n¶ 44   On cross-examination, Janet testified that she was one year old in 1957 and had no\n\nrecollection of the events surrounding Maria’s disappearance. She also agreed that her mother\n\nnever told her how she claimed to know the information she imparted to Janet in the hospital\n\nroom and that she did not ask her mother that question. Janet admitted that her mother was\n\n“disturbed emotionally” while hospitalized. However, on redirect examination, Janet testified\n\nthat her mother was coherent when she made the statement. Janet testified that, in her “own\n\nopinion,” her mother was “lucid” at that point.\n\n\n\n                                              - 14 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 45      Our narrative now jumps to July 27, 2011, when two events occurred: defendant was\n\nextradited from Washington to Illinois, and Maria’s body was exhumed and re-autopsied. We\n\nfirst detail the evidence at trial relating to the Seattle investigation and the extradition.\n\n¶ 46      Seattle detective Irene Lau interviewed defendant at the Seattle police department on\n\nJune 29, 2011. She had already been briefed on the reason for defendant’s presence in the\n\nSeattle police station. Lau testified that when she interviewed defendant he alternated between\n\n“rage and calm” and “was pretty angry.” According to Lau, when she asked defendant if he had\n\nknown Maria or her family, he described Maria as being “very stunningly beautiful with big\n\nbrown eyes.” Further, defendant stated that Maria was “lovely, lovely, lovely.” He appeared to\n\nbe discussing Maria “as if he was talking about someone he had been deeply, deeply in love\n\nwith.” Defendant objected to the characterization, and the objection was sustained. Lau then\n\ntestified that, when defendant made those statements about Maria, “his entire face changed.”\n\nAccording to Lau, whereas defendant’s body had been “quite rigidly stiff” during questioning, he\n\n“had just totally relaxed” when he talked about Maria. On cross-examination, Lau testified that\n\ndefendant vehemently denied any involvement in Maria’s abduction and that he was upset when\n\nhe was accused of being involved.\n\n¶ 47      Seattle homicide detectives Cloyd Steiger and Michael James Ciesynski accompanied\n\ndefendant from Seattle to Sycamore on July 27, 2011. According to the detectives, defendant\n\ntalked the entire time. Steiger described a lot of the conversation with defendant as “chitchatty\n\nstuff.”     However, defendant also discussed matters relevant to Maria’s disappearance.\n\nAccording to Steiger, defendant described Maria as “a beautiful little Barbie doll.”\n\n¶ 48      Steiger testified that defendant talked about his whereabouts on the day Maria was\n\nabducted. Defendant asked the detectives to note how long it took to get from Chicago to\n\n\n\n                                                 - 15 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nSycamore. Defendant stated that he had hitched a ride from Chicago to Rockford, because\n\nRockford was close to Sycamore, and that he called his dad from Rockford. When Steiger asked\n\ndefendant if he made the phone call from the train station in Rockford, defendant responded,\n\n“Oh, no, no, no, I never took the train anywhere that day.”\n\n¶ 49     According to Steiger, while they were en route to Sycamore from O’Hare Airport, they\n\nstopped at a restaurant because defendant was hungry. Ciesynski sat with defendant, and Steiger\n\nsat at a nearby table eavesdropping on defendant’s conversation.        Steiger took notes on a\n\nplacemat. They left the restaurant and defendant talked some more about the case on the ride to\n\nSycamore. Steiger testified that defendant told them about the car he had in 1957 and how\n\nnobody else drove that car. Defendant told Steiger that he last saw Maria when she was five\n\nyears old, standing near the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place. Defendant told\n\nMaria to get away from the road.\n\n¶ 50     When they arrived in Sycamore, they drove to the intersection of Center Cross Street and\n\nArchie Place. Defendant pointed out his old house. According to Steiger, defendant pointed to a\n\nwindow and said, “That’s the window I crawled in that night right there.” Defendant said that he\n\nhad hitchhiked from Rockford to Sycamore when his father could not pick him up in Rockford.\n\nSteiger testified that defendant stated that his family was surprised to see him the next morning.\n\nWhen Steiger asked defendant why he crawled through a window, defendant replied that no one\n\nwas watching and that Sycamore then was “Happy Days.”\n\n¶ 51     On cross-examination, Steiger testified that defendant had denied involvement in the\n\ncrime.    On redirect examination, Steiger testified that Ciesynski at one point suggested to\n\ndefendant the “possibility” that defendant had given Maria piggyback rides on the evening she\n\ndisappeared but that someone else came along and kidnapped her.            According to Steiger,\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndefendant paused for “a couple moments and thought,” and then responded, “No, I never gave\n\nher a piggyback ride.” Then, in response to a question on re-cross-examination, Steiger amended\n\nhis answer and said that defendant responded, “That didn’t occur.”\n\n¶ 52   Ciesynski’s testimony was similar to Steiger’s. Ciesynski testified that defendant told\n\nthem that he “could not have done it,” because he was in Chicago at the time. According to\n\nCiesynski, when defendant called Maria a “beautiful little Barbie doll,” defendant was\n\n“glowing.” Ciesynski wondered aloud whether someone else could have picked Maria up after\n\ndefendant gave her a piggyback ride and left. According to Ciesynski, defendant “sat back kind\n\nof reflectively,” then said, “No, didn’t happen like that.”\n\n¶ 53   We move now to the testimony relating to the other event of July 27, 2011, the\n\nexhumation and second autopsy of Maria’s body. The State did not introduce a report from the\n\npathologist. The State called Dr. Krista Latham, a forensic anthropologist, as its only witness\n\nregarding the 2011 findings.\n\n¶ 54   Dr. Latham was present at the exhumation, and she attended the autopsy. She testified\n\nthat the pathologist did not cut any of the bones during the autopsy. Following the autopsy, Dr.\n\nLatham removed the soft tissue and debris from the bones and then transported the bones to her\n\nlaboratory in Indianapolis for examination. Through dental records, Dr. Latham established that\n\nthe skeleton was Maria’s.\n\n¶ 55   Dr. Latham described the cuts on the bones from the original 1958 autopsy. She then\n\ndescribed three “cutting events” beneath the throat area and in the deep chest region that were\n\nnot related to the 1958 autopsy and had been inflicted with a blade larger than a scalpel, such as a\n\nknife. According to Dr. Latham, these cutting events were also called “sharp force trauma.” Dr.\n\nLatham testified that the cut marks appeared on the front of the back bones. Dr. Latham could\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnot say whether the “cutting events” occurred at the time of death, although she acknowledged\n\nthat her report stated that they might have resulted from trauma inflicted at that time. Nor was\n\nshe able to testify regarding the time of death. Dr. Latham also was unable to recover any\n\n“transfer” DNA, due to DNA degradation that occurred because of water in the casket. On\n\ncross-examination, Dr. Latham testified that she is not an expert in pathologies of soft tissues and\n\nthat she does not examine soft tissues. Rather, she examines hard tissues, being bones and teeth.\n\nDr. Latham testified that she did not read the 1958 autopsy report to look for evidence of ligature\n\nmarks or soft-tissue trauma. Dr. Latham was not asked whether her opinions were rendered\n\nwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n\n¶ 56   The State also introduced evidence through Sycamore police detective Daniel Hoffman\n\nregarding the proximity of the Apple River to the site where Maria’s body was found near\n\nGalena. According to Hoffman, the area on the north side of Route 20, where Maria’s body was\n\nfound, is wooded.\n\n¶ 57   The remainder of the State’s case centered on statements defendant made to inmates of\n\nthe De Kalb County jail. The State’s first inmate witness was Christopher Diaz, who was\n\nincarcerated on a charge of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Diaz had prior convictions of\n\nattempted mob action (reduced from felony mob action) and felony possession of a fraudulent\n\nidentification card. Diaz denied being a gang member.\n\n¶ 58   Diaz testified that in September 2012 he overheard some conversations between\n\ndefendant and Diaz’s cellmate, known as John Doe at trial. According to Diaz, defendant told\n\nDoe that he was giving “the victim” a piggyback ride down an alley and that “the other girl”\n\nwent inside to grab mittens. Diaz testified that he next overheard defendant say that he “had the\n\nvictim in his house for quite a while and that his mom knew about it.” According to Diaz, the\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnext thing he overheard was defendant describing “how he killed the victim, the little girl, saying\n\nhe strangled her with [a] wire.” Then, according to Diaz, defendant said that he hid the girl.\n\nDiaz testified that in another conversation defendant said that he hit the girl on the head but her\n\nskull was “intact.” According to Diaz, in yet another conversation, defendant stated that in order\n\nto “throw people off” he was telling people that he did not have a car, when defendant actually\n\nhad a car with flames painted on it. Diaz testified that at one point defendant was “mad” at the\n\nState’s Attorney and wanted to kill him. According to Diaz, at one time the State had offered\n\ndefendant a deal and defendant said “Fuck that.” Diaz testified that defendant thought that the\n\nState had no evidence except from his mother, who was dead, and a sister, whom he called a\n\n“dumb bitch.” Diaz testified that defendant admitted to giving another girl a piggyback ride at\n\nhis grandfather’s house. Defendant asked Diaz and Doe if they could “do anything” to Kirk\n\nSwaggerty, who was to be a witness against defendant. Finally, Diaz testified that the State had\n\nnot offered him anything for his testimony. On cross-examination, Diaz admitted that there was\n\nan immigration hold on him and that he could be deported. Diaz denied that he thought his\n\nhelpful testimony would benefit him; he said that he had contacted the State’s Attorney because\n\nit was the right thing to do. Diaz also admitted to having pleaded guilty to the charge of being in\n\ncontact with gang members.\n\n¶ 59   The second inmate witness was John Doe. Doe had been convicted of murder, home\n\ninvasion, criminal damage to property, and two counts of unlawful possession of a weapon by a\n\nfelon. According to Doe, between the dates of August 30, 2012, and September 5, 2012, he had\n\nmany conversations with defendant. Doe testified that after he denied knowing anything about\n\ndefendant or his case, and after Doe told defendant that he could not do anything about the\n\nwitnesses who were going to testify against him, defendant “got into details.”\n\n\n\n                                              - 19 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 60    Doe testified that defendant said that he first met “the little girl” along with another little\n\ngirl and that one had to go inside to get her gloves or her “mitts.” Defendant said that he gave\n\nthe other little girl a piggyback ride down an alley behind a building. Defendant fell, and the girl\n\nhit her head and started crying or yelling. Doe testified that defendant said that it was an\n\naccident but that he did not tell anyone about it because no one would believe him. Doe testified\n\nthat defendant stated that he crawled through a window into his house and pulled the little girl\n\nthrough the window, where he “had” her inside his bedroom, something his mother knew about.\n\nAccording to Doe, defendant said that he choked the little girl and then later said that he choked\n\nher with a wire. Doe testified that defendant told him that he put the little girl in his coupe, drove\n\nto Jo Daviess County, and got rid of the body by placing it by some fallen trees. Defendant\n\nstated that he lied about not having the car at that time and also lied about it having a flat tire.\n\n¶ 61    Doe testified that, in their next conversation, defendant was angry and giddy, “almost\n\nchild-like.” Doe testified that defendant got “amped up” when he talked about the little girl.\n\nAccording to Doe, at another time defendant said that most “serious” criminals “like murderers”\n\ncan draw, and then defendant said about himself and Doe, “We can both draw.” In still another\n\nconversation, according to Doe, defendant said that he had called the FBI with a false story,\n\ntrying to lead them in the wrong direction. On cross-examination, Doe denied that he had been\n\npromised anything for his testimony, but he admitted that he had a pending petition asking for a\n\nreduction in his sentence.\n\n¶ 62    Swaggerty was the last inmate witness. He had been convicted of murder and possession\n\nof a weapon by a felon in 2011. Swaggerty testified that the “whole jail” was talking about\n\ndefendant, who was on the news and was being extradited to Illinois. According to Swaggerty,\n\ndefendant introduced himself as the man in the news and then “just began talking.”\n\n\n\n                                                 - 20 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 63   Swaggerty testified that he asked defendant if he was going to “take a plea,” and that\n\ndefendant replied that he could probably get probation because “it was an accident.” According\n\nto Swaggerty, defendant said that he was giving the little girl a piggyback ride when she fell.\n\nDefendant stated that she would not stop screaming and that she accidentally suffocated while\n\ndefendant was trying to keep her quiet. Defendant said that he had at one time called the FBI\n\nwith a story about a dream in which a “guy named ‘Johnny’ did this” to the girl. According to\n\nSwaggerty, defendant then admitted that he was “Johnny.”\n\n¶ 64   Swaggerty also testified that defendant told him details about the investigation in Seattle,\n\nspecifically that defendant’s wife opened the house safe for the police. Swaggerty recalled that\n\ndefendant started to “stare off” during another conversation and then said, “She was a very pretty\n\ngirl,” which Swaggerty found “creepy.” According to Swaggerty, defendant’s demeanor was\n\n“normal” until he started to talk about the little girl. On cross-examination, Swaggerty admitted\n\nthat in a petition to reconsider his sentence he cited his cooperation in the case against defendant\n\nas a basis for leniency. Swaggerty also admitted that he wrote letters to the authorities offering\n\ntestimony against other defendants. On redirect examination, Swaggerty testified that defendant\n\nstated that the State did not have DNA but that, “if they find some,” he would talk about a plea\n\nbargain.\n\n¶ 65   The State’s last witness placed the inmate witnesses and defendant in the jail at the times\n\nof the conversations testified to, and the State rested. Defendant moved for a directed finding,\n\nwhich was denied.\n\n¶ 66   Defendant’s first witness was a jail employee who testified that, according to jail records,\n\nDiaz was a member of the Ambrose street gang.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 67   Next, defendant’s half-sister Mary Hunt testified for defendant. She was present in\n\nEileen’s hospital room when Eileen made the statement regarding defendant to which Janet\n\ntestified. According to Mary, Eileen was “basically comatose.” Mary heard Eileen say only,\n\n“He did it,” without saying who “he” was or what “it” was. Eileen did not answer Mary’s\n\nfollow-up questions. On cross-examination, Mary admitted that Eileen had lucid periods during\n\nher hospitalization.\n\n¶ 68   Defendant’s last witness was Dr. John Prabhakar, the surgeon who had implanted an IV\n\nin Eileen’s neck for the administration of morphine during her January 1994 hospitalization. Dr.\n\nPrabhakar testified that morphine causes confusion, and the doctor noted in Eileen’s chart that\n\nshe was “pleasantly confused.” He also noted that she was “disoriented.” The records showed\n\nthat Eileen was also on Haldol, which the doctor testified could cause confusion. The doctor\n\nnoted that there was a diagnosis of “unspecified psychosis” in the medical record. On cross-\n\nexamination, Dr. Prabhakar testified that he had spent a total of about 30 minutes with Eileen\n\nwhen he inserted the IV and that he could not testify to what she was like on other occasions.\n\nDefendant then rested, and the State presented no rebuttal.\n\n¶ 69   In ruling, the trial court found all of the witnesses credible. The court found the inmate\n\nwitnesses credible even though it found that they were “all bad guys,” that they “all belong in\n\nprison,” and that “they all hope to benefit from their testimony.” The court found that the State\n\nhad not offered them anything in exchange for their testimony. The court further found that,\n\nwhile there was no proof of cause of death in the record, it would draw the inference that\n\nstabbing was the cause of death. The court found Chapman’s eyewitness identification “most\n\nconvincing.” The court found that some witnesses’ memories had dimmed with time but that\n\nthis was “to be expected after these many years.” Based on the totality of the evidence, the court\n\n\n\n                                              - 22 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nfound defendant guilty on all three counts of the indictment. Under the 1957 statutes, the court\n\nsentenced defendant to natural life in the Illinois Department of Corrections on count I, murder;\n\nto five years’ incarceration on count II, kidnapping; and to seven years’ incarceration on count\n\nIII, abduction of an infant. The court ordered that the sentences for kidnapping and abduction of\n\nan infant “merge” with the sentence for murder. Defendant filed a timely appeal.\n\n¶ 70                                  II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 71         A. Whether Defendant Was Proved Guilty Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\n\n¶ 72   Defendant first contends that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He\n\nargues that Chapman’s eyewitness identification 53 years after the crime was not credible and\n\nthat none of the other witnesses with recollections from the 1950s offered any probative evidence\n\nof defendant’s guilt. Defendant argues that the inmate witnesses were incredible due to their\n\nmotivations to lie, their accounts’ internal inconsistencies, the inconsistencies between their\n\naccounts and the physical evidence, and their exposure to the publicity about the case.\n\n¶ 73   In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not retry the case. People v. Milka,\n\n336 Ill. App. 3d 206, 227 (2003). We do not ask ourselves whether we believe that the evidence\n\nat trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Holmes, 141 Ill. 2d 204, 239\n\n(1990). Rather, the proper inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.       Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19 (1979);\n\nHolmes, 141 Ill. 2d at 239.\n\n¶ 74   In a bench trial, the judge determines the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be\n\ngiven to the witnesses’ testimony, and the judge draws reasonable inferences from the evidence.\n\nPeople v. Slim, 127 Ill. 2d 302, 307 (1989). A conviction may be sustained only if the evidence\n\n\n\n                                              - 23 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nsufficed to show that the defendant committed the crime. Milka, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 227. In\n\nmaking such inquiry, it is improper to segregate each piece of evidence in a circumstantial case\n\nand try to locate the doubt therein. Milka, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 229. To the contrary, the evidence\n\nis sufficient if all of it, taken together, satisfied the trier of fact that the defendant is guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Milka, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 229. Further, the court is not bound to\n\nsearch out all possible explanations consistent with innocence or be convinced beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt as to each link in the chain. People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92, 117 (2007).\n\nProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mandate the exclusion of every possible doubt.\n\nPeople v. Slinkard, 362 Ill. App. 3d 855, 858 (2006).\n\n¶ 75   Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the following facts: (1) Maria met her death by criminal means;\n\n(2) Maria was abducted from the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place shortly after 6\n\np.m. on December 3, 1957, by “Johnny”; (3) defendant was “Johnny”; and (4) defendant killed\n\nMaria and disposed of her body in Jo Daviess County.\n\n¶ 76   The State must prove the corpus delicti by competent evidence beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. People v. Jones, 22 Ill. 2d 592, 596 (1961). In a murder case, the corpus delicti consists\n\nof the fact of death and the fact that death was caused by the criminal agency of some person.\n\nJones, 22 Ill. 2d at 595. The corpus delicti can be established by direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence. Jones, 22 Ill. 2d at 596. That Maria died is a certainty. The first autopsy established\n\nthrough dental records that the body found in the timber in Jo Daviess County was Maria’s. In\n\n2011, Dr. Latham reestablished through dental records that the exhumed body was Maria’s. The\n\nrecord contains no cause of death. Dr. Latham could not say whether the cutting events she\n\nfound occurred at the time of death. The most she could say was that the cutting events might\n\n\n\n                                               - 24 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nhave resulted from trauma inflicted at the time of death. Dr. Latham did not so opine within a\n\nreasonable degree of scientific certainty. Nevertheless, the court found that stabbing was the\n\ncause of death. While the inference that stabbing was the cause of death was not supported by\n\nthe evidence, the evidence had to establish only that Maria met her death by a criminal agency.\n\nSee Jones, 22 Ill. 2d at 596 (the question is not the method of proving cause of death but whether\n\nthe fact that death was caused by a criminal agency has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt).\n\nGiven that Maria was only seven years old and that her body was found far from home four\n\nmonths after her disappearance, concealed deep among the timber and posed unnaturally, and\n\ngiven that she was badly decomposed and ravaged by small animals, a rational trier of fact could\n\ninfer that she met her death by a criminal agency. Accordingly, the corpus delicti was proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶ 77   A second reasonable conclusion that the trial court could have drawn was that “Johnny”\n\nabducted Maria. Maria was last seen shortly after 6 p.m. on December 3, 1957, at the corner of\n\nCenter Cross Street and Archie Place. Chapman testified that “Johnny” approached them at 6\n\np.m., he gave Maria a piggyback ride, and Maria ran home, three doors away, and ran back to the\n\ncorner with her doll. Then Chapman went home for her mittens, leaving Maria in Johnny’s\n\ncompany. In the short interval between when Chapman went home, which was also nearby, and\n\nwhen she returned to the corner, Maria had vanished. There was traffic on Center Cross Street,\n\nbut only “Johnny” had been on the corner with Maria when Chapman last saw her. Thus, the\n\ncentral question of the trial was the identification of “Johnny.”\n\n¶ 78   The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the person who\n\ncommitted the charged offense.       People v. Lewis, 165 Ill. 2d 305, 356 (1995).      Chapman\n\ndescribed “Johnny” as having a slender face, with a flip in the side of his hair and large teeth,\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nand weighing 150 pounds. Chapman said that “Johnny” was an older person, but she was eight\n\nand considered someone twice her age to be “older.” Chapman described the sweater that\n\n“Johnny” wore as having a lot of colors in it. In 2010, Chapman identified defendant as\n\n“Johnny.”\n\n¶ 79   While Chapman was the only eyewitness, the State’s case did not rest solely on her\n\nidentification of defendant. Long’s description of “Johnny” was similar to Chapman’s. Long\n\ntestified that “Johnny” was tall and thin, had blondish-brown hair with a flip in it, and had\n\nstrange teeth. Caulfield described defendant in 1957 as just under 6 feet tall, kind of gangly,\n\nwith wavy hair. Caulfield said that defendant frequently wore a multicolored sweater. Twadell\n\ndescribed defendant in the 1950s as 6 feet tall, 150 to 160 pounds, with sandy blond hair.\n\nTwadell also recalled that defendant wore multicolored sweaters.\n\n¶ 80    A single eyewitness’s identification of the accused is sufficient to sustain a conviction if\n\nthe eyewitness viewed the accused under conditions permitting a positive identification. Lewis,\n\n165 Ill. 2d at 356. Our supreme court in Lewis relied on the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers,\n\n409 U.S. 188 (1972), for assessing identification testimony. Lewis, 165 Ill. 2d at 356. Those\n\nfactors include: (1) the witness’s opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the\n\nwitness’s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior description of the criminal;\n\n(4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification confrontation; and (5)\n\nthe length of time between the crime and the identification. Lewis, 165 Ill. 2d at 356.\n\n¶ 81   Chapman and Charles testified that the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place\n\nwas well lit by a streetlight. Chapman saw Johnny as he walked up to them from the south and\n\nspoke to them. She watched Johnny give Maria a piggyback ride down the street and then come\n\nback to the corner. She stood with Johnny, observing him under the streetlight, while Maria\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nwent home to get her doll. She had an adequate opportunity to view Johnny, so the first factor\n\nweighs in the State’s favor. Chapman also paid attention to Johnny, making the second factor\n\nweigh in the State’s favor. The third factor, the accuracy of Chapman’s prior description, also\n\nweighs in the State’s favor. Chapman described the man as having a slender face, a flip in the\n\nside of his hair, and large teeth. The photograph of defendant that she identified as “Johnny”\n\nshows a teenager with a slender face, curly or wavy hair, and large teeth. The fourth factor, the\n\nwitness’s level of certainty, also weighs in the State’s favor. Hanley showed Chapman the\n\nphotographs, which were all similar, by laying them down one-by-one, individually, on her\n\ncoffee table. Chapman gradually eliminated all but defendant’s picture. She told Hanley, “That\n\nis him.” After Maria’s disappearance, the police and the FBI for weeks and months showed\n\nChapman thousands of mug shots and took her to lineups. Yet, she said, she was never shown a\n\npicture of Johnny until Hanley showed her defendant’s photo. The fifth factor, however, the\n\nlength of time between the crime and the identification, weighs in defendant’s favor.\n\n¶ 82   In our research, we did not find a case resembling the span of time that we have here\n\nbetween the observation and the identification. Defendant cites Dallas County v. Commercial\n\nUnion Assurance Co., 286 F.2d 388, 396 (5th Cir. 1961), where, in a completely different\n\ncontext, the court assumed that a witness would not recall the details of a fire 58 years later. We\n\nare not permitted to make such an assumption, because our supreme court has held that the lapse\n\nof time goes to the weight of the testimony, which is for the trier of fact to determine, and does\n\nnot destroy the witness’s credibility. People v. Rodgers, 53 Ill. 2d 207, 214 (1972). Chapman\n\nnot only had the ability to observe defendant on December 3, 1957, she had an excellent reason\n\nto remember him for all the years afterward. She was a witness to an event that horrified the\n\ncommunity and caused her to be the object of law enforcement and news media attention (a\n\n\n\n                                              - 27 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnewspaper photo of her in her mittens is in evidence). For a time the police even accompanied\n\nher to Sunday school, making their presence in her life onerous. As we discussed above, her\n\nidentification was sufficiently corroborated. Defendant attempts to cast doubt on Chapman’s\n\ncredibility now by arguing that People’s exhibit No. 80, a photograph, which appears to be a\n\nnewspaper photo taken in the 1950s, of the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place, does\n\nnot show a streetlight. Chapman was not impeached on that point at trial, and we cannot tell\n\nfrom the photograph whether there is a streetlight. However, Charles corroborated Chapman’s\n\ntestimony that the corner was well lit.\n\n¶ 83   In assessing Chapman’s testimony, defendant relies on People v. Williams, 383 Ill. App.\n\n3d 596 (2008). However, in Williams, the evidence “rested solely on the hesitant testimony of\n\ntwo minors” who were substantially prodded “through vigorous leading questions” and whose\n\ntestimony was riddled with “internal inconsistencies and self-contradictions.” Williams, 383 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 638. To the contrary, Chapman was an adult when she testified, her testimony was\n\nclear, not hesitant, the State did not have to prod or lead her, and her testimony was not internally\n\ninconsistent or self-contradictory. Nor did her testimony conflict with that of other witnesses.\n\nWe discussed above how remarkably similar her description of defendant was to those given by\n\nLong, Twadell, and Caulfield. For the same reasons, defendant’s reliance on People v. Broome,\n\n130 Ill. App. 2d 227 (1970), is misplaced. In Broome, a 15-year-old eyewitness’s testimony was\n\nfound wanting where the identification occurred in the dark, in pouring rain, and when the\n\neyewitness was not wearing his eyeglasses. Broome, 130 Ill. App. 2d at 228-29.\n\n¶ 84   Defendant maintains that the other witnesses from the 1950s added nothing to the State’s\n\ncase. We disagree. The people close to defendant expected him to be around on the night Maria\n\ndisappeared but could not account for his whereabouts that night. Crain expected defendant to\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndrive her home that night after she and Edwards finished decorating Edwards’ father’s hobby\n\nshop, yet she neither saw nor heard from him. Twadell called defendant as soon as he heard that\n\nMaria was missing, but defendant was not at home. Jeanne and Caulfield testified that defendant\n\ndid not come home that night. They did not see him the next morning either.\n\n¶ 85   Other things were missing. Caulfield testified that, after Maria disappeared, Caulfield\n\nnever again saw the multicolored sweater that defendant had frequently worn. She also testified\n\nthat defendant’s coupe was not at the home that night. The coupe’s absence was significant in\n\nlight of Twadell’s testimony that defendant never allowed anyone else to drive it. A rational\n\ntrier of fact could infer that defendant was somewhere unknown to anyone close to him and that\n\nhe was in possession of his coupe that night. That inference takes on significance in light of\n\nCaulfield’s testimony that defendant was familiar with the area where Maria’s body was found.\n\n¶ 86   Defendant does not even discuss the Seattle detectives’ testimony, much less question\n\ntheir credibility. Yet, defendant made crucial statements to Steiger and Ciesynski regarding his\n\nwhereabouts on the day and night of Maria’s disappearance. Defendant said that he hitchhiked\n\nfrom Chicago to Rockford and then hitchhiked from Rockford to Sycamore. He told Steiger that\n\nhe crawled through a window into his house and surprised his family the next morning. When\n\nSteiger asked why he climbed through a window, defendant did not answer the question but said\n\nthat no one was looking and that Sycamore was “Happy Days.” The trial judge could have found\n\ndefendant’s version of his whereabouts incredible, especially in light of Jeanne’s and Caulfield’s\n\ntestimony that they did not see him the next morning. Further, when defendant told Steiger that\n\nhe never allowed anyone else to drive his coupe, defendant corroborated Twadell’s testimony.\n\nThe significance of this admission becomes apparent in light of Caulfield’s testimony that\n\ndefendant’s coupe was not at the home on the night Maria disappeared. If defendant was driving\n\n\n\n                                              - 29 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe coupe, he was not hitchhiking. A false exculpatory statement is probative of consciousness\n\nof guilt. People v. Milka, 211 Ill. 2d 150, 181 (2004) (the defendant lied to the police about his\n\nwhereabouts during the critical time periods); People v. Hommerson, 399 Ill. App. 3d 405, 410\n\n(2010) (the defendant’s whereabouts were critical, yet he never gave the police a consistent\n\nexplanation of them).\n\n¶ 87   Defendant made the most damaging statement to Ciesynski. Ciesynski suggested to\n\ndefendant that after defendant gave Maria a piggyback ride someone else might have come along\n\nand taken her, to which defendant replied after some reflection, “No, didn’t happen that way.”\n\nDefendant’s statement could be construed to mean that he was not present at the scene or did not\n\ngive Maria a piggyback ride. Or it could be construed to mean that defendant was present at the\n\nscene and knew exactly what happened.\n\n¶ 88   Defendant argues that the jail inmates’ testimony was unworthy of belief. Yet, after\n\nacknowledging that they all were “bad” people, criminals who deserved to be in prison and who\n\nhoped for leniency, the trial court found them credible.      “[I]t is quite established that the\n\ncredibility of a government informant, as with any other witness,” is a question for the trier of\n\nfact. People v. Manning, 182 Ill. 2d 193, 210 (1998).\n\n¶ 89    Defendant posits that “so much” of what the inmates said “was based on what was\n\nalready public knowledge.” This statement is not borne out by the record. Swaggerty testified\n\nthat the whole jail was talking about the man who, according to the news, was being extradited to\n\nDe Kalb County, but Swaggerty did not testify to what, if any, details of the crime the inmates\n\nlearned from the news. Swaggerty testified only that it was “obvious” that defendant was\n\ncharged with a 50-year-old murder. Then, said Swaggerty, defendant “just began talking.” The\n\nfirst time defendant met Doe, he asked Doe if he had heard of him or seen anything on TV. Doe\n\n\n\n                                              - 30 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nanswered no. Defendant asked Doe if he knew about a 1956 or 1957 murder of which defendant\n\nwas accused, and Doe said no. Diaz did not indicate that he had any preexisting knowledge of\n\nthe crime.\n\n¶ 90   Defendant argues that the inmates’ testimony concerning the manner of death conflicted\n\nwith Dr. Latham’s testimony. Diaz overheard defendant say that he strangled Maria with a wire.\n\nDefendant told Doe that Maria hit her head when defendant slipped and fell during a piggyback\n\nride, that defendant pulled Maria inside his house through a window, and that he “had” her inside\n\n“the bedroom,” after which he choked her with a wire. Swaggerty testified that defendant told\n\nhim that Maria accidentally suffocated after she fell during a piggyback ride and would not stop\n\nscreaming.\n\n¶ 91   The evidence does not show how Maria died. At the first autopsy Dr. Truemner said that\n\nhe could not opine on the cause of death, because of the advanced state of decomposition and the\n\nravages from small animals. Dr. Truemner could not tell whether the hyoid bone or the larynx\n\nwas fractured. Dr. Truemner did not find any form of “obvious, gross, mechanical trauma.” He\n\ndid not find three stab wounds.\n\n¶ 92   While Dr. Latham found “sharp force trauma,” neither autopsy ruled out ligature\n\nstrangulation, because Dr. Latham, as a forensic anthropologist, did not examine the soft tissues\n\nof the neck area, and Dr. Truemner stated that dissection of them was virtually impossible due to\n\nthe effects of decomposition. Thus, nothing in the forensic evidence is inconsistent with the\n\ninmates’ testimony regarding defendant’s statements.        Defendant argues that the forensic\n\nevidence does not show a skull injury and thus contradicts Diaz’s testimony that defendant said\n\nthat he hit Maria on the head. However, Diaz also heard defendant say that Maria’s “skull was\n\nintact” after the blow, an interesting choice of words since Dr. Truemner had stated that the skull\n\n\n\n                                              - 31 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nwas “intact,” a fact that Diaz would not know unless defendant had discussed the matter in front\n\nof Diaz.\n\n¶ 93   We recognize that defendant gave Doe and Swaggerty slightly different versions of how\n\nhe killed Maria. However, the variances are not such that they raise a reasonable doubt of\n\ndefendant’s guilt, because none of the versions was impossible under the evidence, as was the\n\ncase in People v. Lindsey, 73 Ill. App. 3d 436 (1979). In Lindsey, the court reversed the\n\ndefendant’s murder conviction where the defendant had confessed to “rapes of two girls later\n\nfound to be virgins; a stabbing of which there was no supporting evidence; strangulation by rope\n\nof which there was no evidence; arson by use of an accelerant for which there was no supporting\n\ntestimony; and aggravated assault on parts of a body which bore equivocal evidence of such an\n\ninjury.” Lindsey, 73 Ill. App. 3d at 448. In Lindsey, the court declared that the prosecution’s\n\nevidence taxed “even the gullibility of the credulous.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\nLindsey, 73 Ill. App. 3d at 448. That was not the case here. Dr. Truemner in 1958 could not\n\ndissect the soft tissues of the neck, so he did not opine with respect to any injuries or lack thereof\n\nin that area. Dr. Latham is a forensic anthropologist. She examined the bones. She specifically\n\ntestified that she did not examine the soft tissues of the neck. Thus, the evidence does not\n\ncontradict the testimony that defendant stated that he strangled Maria with a wire.\n\n¶ 94   Furthermore, the inmates testified to details that were too obscure to mean anything to\n\nthem unless defendant had related them to the inmates in context.             Swaggerty knew that\n\ndefendant’s wife opened their home safe when the police executed the search warrant in Seattle,\n\nsomething only defendant could have told him. Diaz overheard defendant tell Doe that to throw\n\npeople off he told people that he did not have a car, when in actuality he had a car with flames\n\npainted on it. Defendant told Doe how he had deceived people by saying that his car had been\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndisabled, when in reality he had used the car to transport Maria’s body to Jo Daviess County.\n\nDefendant told Doe and Swaggerty that he had deliberately misled the FBI by planting false\n\nstories. Attempts to deflect the investigation prove consciousness of guilt. People v. Ehlert, 211\n\nIll. 2d 192, 240 (2004).\n\n¶ 95   Evidence of threats to intimidate or kill witnesses is also proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\nPeople v. Rogers, 2014 IL App (4th) 121088, ¶ 21. Defendant asked Diaz and Doe if they could\n\n“do anything about” the witnesses who were going to testify against him, and defendant\n\nspecifically named Swaggerty. Diaz also said that defendant was “mad” at the State’s Attorney\n\nand wanted to kill him.\n\n¶ 96   Further, Swaggerty knew that defendant used to go by the name “Johnny” and Diaz knew\n\nthat defendant gave another little girl a piggyback ride at his grandfather’s house.          That\n\ndefendant was the “Johnny” who gave Long a piggyback ride near “Old Man Tessier’s” house in\n\nLong’s backyard is something that only defendant could have told the inmates.\n\n¶ 97   Defendant claims that it is incredible that a man would identify himself before\n\ncommitting a serious crime. However, the evidence showed that defendant singled out very\n\nyoung girls. It happened that one of them remembered him for the rest of her life. Defendant\n\ncites People v. Dawson, 22 Ill. 2d 260 (1961), but that case is inapposite. In Dawson, our\n\nsupreme court found it incredible that the defendant, a police officer and a person of good\n\ncharacter and reputation, would commit an armed robbery after identifying himself in an office\n\nwhere he was well known. Dawson, 22 Ill. 2d at 265. Our supreme court said that this was\n\nespecially so where the defendant made no attempt to flee the scene. Dawson, 22 Ill. 2d at 265.\n\nIn our case, Chapman did not know defendant. The evidence showed that defendant was much\n\nolder than Maria and that he had not played with her. The evidence also showed that Maria and\n\n\n\n                                              - 33 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nChapman attended public school, whereas the Tessier children attended parochial school.\n\nDefendant risked nothing by introducing himself as “Johnny” in an effort to ingratiate himself\n\nwith two very young grade schoolers. Further, defendant might not have planned the crime at\n\nthe time he introduced himself.\n\n¶ 98    Defendant argues that the prosecution failed to exclude the possibility that the man who\n\ngave Maria a piggyback ride left the area and then someone else came by the scene and abducted\n\nher. He cites People v. Holsapple, 30 Ill. App. 3d 976 (1975), for the proposition that the State\n\nmust exclude the possibility that someone else committed the crime. However, Holsapple used\n\nthe reasonable-hypothesis-of-innocence standard of review. Holsapple, 30 Ill. App. 3d at 990\n\n(“In order to sustain the conviction, the evidence must exclude any reasonable hypothesis of\n\ninnocence.”). This standard of review was rejected by our supreme court in People v. Pintos,\n\n133 Ill. 2d 286, 291 (1989). In Pintos, our supreme court held that “the reasonable hypothesis of\n\ninnocence standard of review is no longer viable in Illinois. Instead, we find that the reasonable\n\ndoubt test as set forth in People v. Collins (1985), 106 Ill. 2d 237, 261, should be applied in\n\nreviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in all criminal cases, whether the evidence is direct or\n\ncircumstantial.” Pintos, 133 Ill. 2d at 291. In Collins, our supreme court, following Jackson,\n\n443 U.S. at 319, held that the “relevant question is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Emphasis in original and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted.) Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261. Consequently, the State did not have to exclude the\n\npossibility that someone else could have appeared on the scene and abducted Maria. At oral\n\nargument, defendant agreed that Collins sets forth the correct standard of review.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 34 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 99     Defendant contends that all of the evidence permits only the conclusion that he had the\n\nopportunity to commit the crime, as did others. Defendant cites People v. Dowaliby, 221 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 788 (1991). However, in Dowaliby, the court named another person who had the\n\nopportunity to commit the murder. Dowaliby, 221 Ill. App. 3d at 798. Here, defendant names\n\nno one else.     Also, in Dowaliby, the State’s only evidence was of opportunity and an\n\nidentification of the defendant’s nose structure and car. Dowaliby, 221 Ill. App. 3d at 797. Here,\n\nChapman identified defendant’s entire face, and her description of defendant was consistent with\n\ndefendant’s appearance in 1957 and with Long’s description of “Johnny.” While the evidence\n\nshowed that there were cars traveling on Center Cross Street at 6 p.m. on December 3, 1957, the\n\nevidence also showed that no one was present at the corner except defendant and the two little\n\ngirls.\n\n¶ 100 Finally, defendant relies on People v. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, in which this\n\ncourt reversed the defendant’s murder conviction. Rivera is distinguishable. In Rivera, the\n\nphysical evidence recovered from the scene was not matched to the defendant. Rivera, 2011 IL\n\nApp (2d) 091060, ¶ 29.       Perhaps most important, DNA determined conclusively that the\n\ndefendant was not the source of the sperm found inside the victim. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d)\n\n091060, ¶ 30. Against all of this exculpatory evidence, we said that the testimony of the\n\njailhouse informants was incredible. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, ¶ 39. Here, as we\n\ndiscussed above, the forensic evidence did not tend to exonerate defendant. In Rivera, the\n\njailhouse informants had testified only that the defendant had admitted that he committed the\n\nmurder, without further details. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, ¶ 14. In stark contrast, the\n\ninmate witnesses in our case divulged a wealth of minutiae that could have come only from\n\ndefendant—that defendant used a 1948 coupe with flames painted on it to transport Maria’s\n\n\n\n                                              - 35 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nbody; that defendant gave another little girl piggyback rides at his grandfather’s house; that\n\ndefendant lied about whether he had a car at the time of Maria’s disappearance; that defendant’s\n\nwife opened the safe during the execution of the search warrant in Seattle; and that defendant\n\nplanted false stories with the FBI. In Rivera, we said that jailhouse informants’ testimony should\n\nbe treated with caution. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, ¶ 36. Here, the trial court followed\n\nthat admonition but still found the inmates’ testimony credible. Their credibility was for the trier\n\nof fact to determine and could be the basis for a finding of guilt. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d)\n\n091060, ¶ 36. Furthermore, our supreme court recently affirmed that the testimony of jailhouse\n\ninformants is not to be viewed as inherently unbelievable. People v. Belknap, 2014 IL 117094,\n\n¶ 55.\n\n¶ 101 Having examined the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, as we are required\n\nto do, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for any rational trier of fact to find that all of\n\nthe essential elements of the crimes were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶ 102          B. Whether Defendant Was Deprived of the Right to Present a Defense\n\n¶ 103 Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in excluding certain FBI reports and\n\nSolar’s testimony indicating that at one time the police had another suspect. Defendant contends\n\nthat the exclusion of this evidence deprived him of his right to present a defense.\n\n¶ 104   A criminal defendant has a right to a meaningful opportunity to present a complete\n\ndefense. Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 331 (2006). The United States Supreme\n\nCourt has held that this right is violated by state evidentiary rules that infringe upon a “weighty\n\ninterest of the accused” and are “arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed\n\nto serve.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Holmes, 547 U.S. at 324. While the Constitution\n\nprohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules “that serve no legitimate purpose or that\n\n\n\n                                                - 36 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nare disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote,” other, well-established rules\n\nof evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by other\n\nfactors, such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.\n\nHolmes, 547 U.S. at 326. It is, of course, within the trial court’s discretion to determine whether\n\nevidence is admissible, and the court’s decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. People v. Garcia, 2012 IL App (2d) 100656, ¶ 17. A trial court abuses its discretion\n\nwhen its decision is arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, or when no reasonable person would\n\ntake the trial court’s view. Garcia, 2012 IL App (2d) 100656, ¶ 17.\n\n¶ 105                                 1. The FBI Reports\n\n¶ 106 We first consider the admissibility of the FBI reports. Defendant posits that, due to the\n\npassage of so much time, crucial witnesses and documents that established his alibi had\n\ndisappeared, making the introduction of the FBI reports appropriate, even necessary, in a search\n\nfor the truth. Defendant maintains that the FBI reports place him in Rockford when Maria was\n\nabducted. Defendant sought to introduce the FBI reports on two grounds: that they are ancient\n\ndocuments and that they are public records. It is incumbent upon the party offering hearsay to\n\nestablish that it meets the requirements of an exception. Garcia, 2012 IL App (2d) 100656, ¶ 20.\n\n¶ 107 Illinois Rule of Evidence 803(16) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) provides that statements in a\n\ndocument in existence 20 years or more, the authenticity of which is established, are not\n\nexcluded by the hearsay rule. At the hearing on defendant’s motion to admit the FBI reports, the\n\nState conceded the documents’ authenticity, and it is not disputed that the documents have been\n\nin existence more than 20 years. We have found no Illinois case that governs this issue, although\n\nthe State relies on cases holding that police reports are inadmissible as substantive evidence\n\nbecause they are generated in anticipation of litigation and thus lack trustworthiness and\n\n\n\n                                              - 37 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nreliability. See People v. Ullrich, 328 Ill. App. 3d 811, 820 (2002). However, cases such as\n\nUllrich and People v. Smith, 141 Ill. 2d 40, 72 (1990), in which our supreme court held that\n\nrecords relating to a police investigation are generally excluded from the business-records\n\nexception to the hearsay rule, do not address admissibility under Rule 803(16). Another reason\n\npolice reports are generally excluded as substantive evidence relates to serious confrontation-\n\nclause and cross-examination concerns. Ullrich, 328 Ill. App. 3d at 820.\n\n¶ 108 The Illinois Rules of Evidence largely track the Federal Rules of Evidence. Parkway\n\nBank & Trust Co. v. Korzen, 2013 IL App (1st) 130380, ¶ 33. Thus, it is appropriate to look to\n\nfederal cases for guidance. Porter v. Decatur Memorial Hospital, 227 Ill. 2d 343, 357 (2008).\n\nIn Hicks v. Charles Pfizer & Co., 466 F. Supp. 2d 799, 806 (E.D. Tex. 2005), the court held that,\n\nif the author of an ancient document had personal knowledge of the substance underlying the\n\nassertive statements, the document is admissible under the ancient-document exception to the\n\nhearsay rule. In Hicks, the court identified the “crucial issue” as whether Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 803(16), which is identical to the Illinois rule, inoculates all assertive statements\n\ncontained within ancient documents, including double hearsay. Hicks, 466 F. Supp. 2d at 806.\n\nThe court indicated that courts are split on the issue. Hicks, 466 F. Supp. 2d at 806. Some courts\n\nrequire that a separate hearsay exception must apply to each layer of hearsay contained within\n\nthe ancient document, while other courts imply that multiple layers of otherwise inadmissible\n\nhearsay may be admitted under Rule 803(16). Hicks, 466 F. Supp. 2d at 806.\n\n¶ 109 The FBI reports at issue here present the problem of multiple hearsay. The reports were\n\nauthored by FBI agents who had no personal knowledge of the substance of the underlying\n\nassertions. The reports relate what Oswald reported that defendant told Oswald; what Oswald\n\nrelated that Liberwitz and Froom told Oswald; what Eileen and Ralph told the agents; and what\n\n\n\n                                              - 38 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe general manager of the telephone company said his records showed. Generally, “the risk of\n\ndeception or mistake is compounded with each additional layer of hearsay.” Hicks, 466 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 806. The risk of deception is further compounded when we consider that defendant was the\n\nsource of the first part of the “alibi,” the train trip that defendant told Oswald he took from\n\nChicago to Rockford, and that defendant’s parents were the source of the second part of\n\ndefendant’s “alibi,” the 7:10 p.m. collect call and Ralph’s picking defendant up in Rockford.\n\nOne of the underpinnings of the ancient-document exception to the hearsay rule is that an\n\nassertive statement found in an ancient document is more likely to be truthful because it was\n\nwritten before the current motive to fabricate arose. Hicks, 466 F. Supp. 2d at 805. However,\n\ndefendant and his parents had a motive to fabricate when they gave their alibi statements in\n\n1957. If, when the document was written, a motive for misrepresentation already existed, the\n\ndocument can be excluded under Illinois Rule of Evidence 403 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) as unfairly\n\nprejudicial. See Ultratec, Inc. v. Sorenson Communications, Inc., No. 13-cv-346-bbc, 2014 WL\n\n4829173, at *7 (W.D. Wis. Sept. 29, 2014) (document that otherwise qualifies as an ancient\n\ndocument may be excluded under Rule 403 where a motive for misrepresentation existed when\n\nthe document was written).\n\n¶ 110 We agree with Hicks that the better view is that each layer of hearsay contained in an\n\nancient document must be excused by its own hearsay exception. This is the view adopted by\n\nour own Seventh Circuit in United States v. Hajda, 135 F.3d 439, 444 (7th Cir. 1998) (the\n\nadmissibility exception applies only to the document itself; if a document contains more than one\n\nlevel of hearsay, an appropriate exception must be found for each level). The court in Hajda\n\nfound this to be consistent with Federal Rule of Evidence 805, which provides that hearsay\n\nincluded within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined\n\n\n\n                                             - 39 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nstatements conforms to an exception. Illinois Rule of Evidence 805 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) is\n\nidentical. If we were to read Rule 803(16) as inoculating multiple levels of hearsay, Rule 805\n\nwould be superfluous. See Columbia First Bank, FSB v. United States, 58 Fed. Cl. 333, 338\n\n(2003). In other words, ordinarily Rule 803(16) applies only where the declarant is the author of\n\nthe ancient document. Columbia, 58 Fed. Cl. at 338.\n\n¶ 111   For this reason, we reject defendant’s reliance on Dallas County, 286 F.2d at 390-91,\n\nwhere the court admitted a 58-year-old newspaper article about a fire, and his reliance on State v.\n\nSargent, 710 N.E.2d 1170 (Ohio Ct. App. 1998), where police reports were admitted as ancient\n\ndocuments. In Dallas County, the newspaper article was admitted to show that the Dallas\n\nCounty courthouse in Selma, Alabama, was damaged by fire in 1901. Aside from any double\n\nhearsay, the character of the matter sought to be proved by the newspaper article—that the\n\ncourthouse was damaged by fire—is not susceptible to the pitfalls of recent fabrication.\n\nContrariwise, the “alibi” contained in the FBI reports depends almost entirely on defendant’s\n\nown account of his actions and the accounts given by his parents.\n\n¶ 112 In Sargent, in a hearing to determine whether the defendant was a repeat violent offender\n\nunder Ohio law, the trial court admitted out-of-state police reports under the ancient-document\n\nexception to the hearsay rule. Sargent, 710 N.E.2d at 1175. Contrary to our holding today that\n\neach layer of hearsay must be excused by its own exception, the court in Sargent imposed no\n\nsuch requirement. In our view, satisfying the mere procedural requirements of the exception\n\ndoes not ensure trustworthiness or reliability. For this reason, we believe that the approach the\n\ncourt took in Sargent is unworkable. “The dangers of hearsay relate to flaws in perception,\n\nmemory, narration, and sincerity.” Rehm v. Ford Motor Co., 365 S.W.3d 570, 581 (Ky. Ct. App.\n\n2011) (Caperton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, we agree that the\n\n\n\n                                              - 40 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nancient-document exception is “not a wide open door but a narrow crevice.” Rehm, 365 S.W.3d\n\nat 579 (Caperton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Consequently, the FBI reports\n\nwere not admissible under Rule 803(16).\n\n¶ 113 We next consider whether the FBI reports were admissible as public documents under\n\nIllinois Rule of Evidence 803(8) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011), which permits, as a hearsay exception, the\n\nadmission of records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of a public office or\n\nagency as to the activities of the office or agency or matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed\n\nby law as to which matters there was a duty to report. Defendant concedes that the second part\n\nof Rule 803(8) excludes police reports. Nevertheless, linking the admission of the FBI reports to\n\nhis right to call witnesses in his defense, he argues that the purpose of the exclusion, the\n\nprotection of a defendant’s rights of confrontation and cross-examination, disappears when the\n\ndefendant seeks their admission. The dangers and weaknesses of the multiple hearsay contained\n\nin the FBI reports were detailed above. Shifting the ground upon which admissibility is urged\n\ndoes not erase the inherent flaws. Multiple hearsay remains multiple hearsay, and it is not\n\nadmissible under Rule 805 unless each layer of hearsay is excused by its own exception.\n\nDefendant cites no case holding that the right to call witnesses includes the right to present\n\nmultiple hearsay.\n\n¶ 114 We conclude that the exclusion of the FBI reports did not violate defendant’s right to\n\npresent a defense, for two reasons: (1) the rule of evidence prohibiting their admission is not\n\narbitrary, and (2) even if the FBI reports had been admitted, they do not tend to exonerate\n\ndefendant. Holmes held that the Constitution prohibits the “exclusion of defense evidence under\n\nrules that serve no legitimate purpose.” Holmes, 547 U.S. at 326. The rule against hearsay is\n\ngrounded in the necessity of cross-examination, and it is a basic rather than a technical rule.\n\n\n\n                                              - 41 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nGrand Liquor Co. v. Department of Revenue, 67 Ill. 2d 195, 199 (1977). Allowing rank hearsay\n\nor multiple hearsay, without any means of testing its veracity through cross-examination, would\n\nlead to the unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and potential to mislead that Holmes\n\nidentified as legitimate reasons to exclude evidence. At the heart of this issue is defendant’s\n\ndesire to present an alibi defense without allowing the State the opportunity for cross-\n\nexamination.   That desire is understandable, given that his 1957 “alibi” could have been\n\nimpeached by statements he made in 2011, as we discuss below.\n\n¶ 115 Further, the FBI reports do not tend to support an alibi defense, because they are\n\ninconsistent and inconclusive.   A defendant presents an alibi when he presents competent\n\nevidence that he was at a specified place other than the crime scene at the time of the offense.\n\nPeople v. Colts, 269 Ill. App. 3d 679, 691 (1993). A defendant who attempts to prove an alibi\n\nmust cover the actual and exact time that the crime was committed. Garrity v. People, 107 Ill.\n\n162, 163 (1883). The defendant must account for his whereabouts for the time during which the\n\nact could have been consummated. People v. Van Dyke, 414 Ill. 251, 256 (1953). Chapman\n\ntestified that defendant approached her and Maria at the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie\n\nPlace in Sycamore at 6 p.m.\n\n¶ 116 In 1957, defendant told Oswald that he was on a train from Chicago to Rockford at 6\n\np.m., arriving at 6:45 p.m. Oswald repeated defendant’s story to the FBI, but neither Oswald nor\n\nthe FBI confirmed it. Indeed, Oswald stated that, although he learned that the Army Reserve\n\nunit on Van Buren Street in Chicago had issued the train ticket, “no verification of the\n\ninformation could be obtained at the time of calling,” and Oswald stated that it was highly\n\nirregular that such a ticket would have been issued. Thus, the story of the train ticket is\n\nconfusing, and it is less than clear whether defendant was even issued a ticket. Consequently,\n\n\n\n                                             - 42 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe FBI report does not cover defendant’s whereabouts at 6 p.m.         More important, in 2011,\n\ndefendant himself debunked the story that he was on a train.        Steiger asked defendant if he\n\ncalled home that evening from the Rockford train station. Defendant replied, “Oh, no, no, no, I\n\nnever took the train anywhere that day.”\n\n¶ 117 Oswald related to the FBI that defendant “apparently proceeded” from the train station to\n\nthe post office in Rockford, where he “personally contacted” Liberwitz. However, that contact\n\nwas made, according to Oswald, at 7:15 or 7:30 p.m., well after Maria’s abduction, because\n\nshortly after 7 p.m. Caulfield saw police cars at the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie\n\nPlace in Sycamore. Defendant’s meeting with Froom would have occurred even later than 7:15\n\nor 7:30 p.m.\n\n¶ 118 Similarly, the telephone calls that Ralph and Eileen reported receiving at 7:10 p.m.\n\noccurred significantly after Maria’s abduction.        Further, the FBI report detailing Eileen’s\n\nstatement in which she reported that Ralph picked defendant up in Rockford was contradicted by\n\ndefendant himself when, in 2011, he told Steiger that he hitchhiked from Chicago to Rockford\n\nand then hitchhiked from Rockford to Sycamore and climbed into his house, unnoticed, through\n\na window. Defendant’s hitchhiking story is also at odds with his December 4, 1957, statement to\n\nOswald that he was not in Sycamore on the night of December 3.\n\n¶ 119 The only FBI report containing information that could conceivably have been useful to\n\ndefendant at trial was the one concerning the 6:57 p.m. telephone call, although it does not cinch\n\nan alibi for 6 p.m. and is inconsistent with Ralph’s and Eileen’s reports that the call was made at\n\n7:10 p.m. However, the report contains three levels of hearsay: the telephone company’s general\n\nmanager’s statement as to what the telephone records showed; the telephone records; and the\n\ncaller’s statement supplying his name to the operator.\n\n\n\n                                              - 43 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 120 Arguably, the telephone records could have been admitted under Illinois Rule of\n\nEvidence 803(6) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) as business records if they existed and had a proper\n\nfoundation.    See United States v. Towns, 718 F.3d 404, 408-09 (5th Cir. 2013) (proper\n\nfoundation for business record is laid by affidavit that attests to the requisite elements of Rule\n\n803(6)). Pursuant to Rule 803(6), records are not excluded by the hearsay rule if they were made\n\nat or near the time by a person with knowledge; if they were kept in the course of a regularly\n\nconducted business activity; and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make\n\nthe record. Ill. R. Evid. 803(6) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011).\n\n¶ 121 Unfortunately, the FBI did not procure the actual telephone records but relied solely on\n\nthe general manager’s representation as to what they contained. Furthermore, multiple hearsay is\n\nexcused by Rule 803(6) only where both the source and the recorder of the information, as well\n\nas every other participant in the chain producing the record, are acting in the regular course of\n\nbusiness. Wilson v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 939 F.2d 260, 271-72 (5th Cir. 1991) (hospital\n\nrecords were admissible as business records but statement of informant contained in hospital\n\nrecords was second level of hearsay needing its own exception); Alzuraqi v. Group 1 Automotive,\n\nInc., 921 F. Supp. 2d 648, 671 (N.D. Tex. 2013) (if customer surveys fell within business-\n\nrecords exception to hearsay rule, the contents of the surveys were hearsay because the sources\n\nof the contents were outsiders). Thus, if the source of the information is an outsider, Rule 803(6)\n\ndoes not, by itself, permit the admission of the business record. Wilson, 939 F.2d at 271. The\n\noutsider’s statement must fall within another hearsay exception to be admissible, because it does\n\nnot have the presumption of accuracy that statements made during the regular course of business\n\nhave. Wilson, 939 F.2d at 271.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 44 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 122 Here, defendant sought to show not only that a telephone call was made at 6:57 p.m. from\n\na number in Rockford to a number listed to Ralph Tessier in Sycamore but that he made the call.\n\nAccording to the FBI report, the call was collect, meaning that it went through an operator.\n\nNecessarily, the person making the call gave the operator a name. The person making the call\n\nwould be an outsider not acting in the regular course of the telephone company’s business. The\n\noperator generally would have no personal knowledge of the caller. Therefore, the name of the\n\ncaller would not be covered by Rule 803(6). The accuracy of the information in the FBI report is\n\nfurther diluted by the fact that the operator wrote the name “Tassier,” and it was only the\n\nmanager’s opinion that the operator had misspelled “Tessier.”\n\n¶ 123 Furthermore, the record shows that defendant’s alibi, as he related it to Steiger and\n\nCiesynski in July 2011, was placed before the trier of fact. Defendant told Ciesynski that he was\n\nin Chicago. During the trip from Seattle, he kept emphasizing to the detectives to pay attention\n\nto how much time it took to get from Chicago to Sycamore. Defendant told Steiger that he\n\nhitchhiked from Chicago to Rockford because Rockford was close to Sycamore; that he called\n\nhis father from Rockford but his father could not pick him up; and that he hitchhiked from\n\nRockford to Sycamore. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court’s denial of the motion to\n\nadmit the FBI reports.\n\n¶ 124                             2. Patrick Solar’s Testimony\n\n¶ 125   Defendant next contends that it was error to exclude Solar’s testimony regarding a\n\nsuspect that the Sycamore police developed in 1996. Defendant wanted to call Solar to testify\n\nthat the facts of a 1951 murder in Pennsylvania “closely matched” the Ridulph case. In the\n\nPennsylvania case, according to Solar’s 1997 report, Redmond, a transient laborer employed by a\n\nlocal carnival, was suspected of “tempting” an eight-year-old girl away from a carnival ride and\n\n\n\n                                             - 45 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nsexually assaulting her. The Pennsylvania case went cold until 1988. Redmond’s fingerprint\n\nwas found in the truck in which the victim was found. According to Solar’s report, while he was\n\nin jail in 1988, Redmond made comments about being involved in “one other” child abduction\n\ncase. Solar speculated that “this could have been the Ridulph case.” Redmond died in Nebraska\n\nin 1992 without ever standing trial for the 1951 murder. Solar noted that Redmond had been a\n\ntruck driver and that Route 20 extended west into Nebraska where Redmond lived.\n\n¶ 126 An accused may, within certain limits, attempt to prove that someone else committed the\n\ncrime with which he is charged. People v. Ward, 101 Ill. 2d 443, 455 (1984). The test of\n\nadmissibility is whether the evidence “fairly tends” to prove the particular offense with which the\n\ndefendant is charged. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455. The court\n\nmay reject the offered evidence as irrelevant “if it has little probative value due to its remoteness,\n\nuncertainty or its possibly unfair prejudicial nature.” Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455. It is within the\n\ncourt’s sound discretion whether to admit such evidence, and the court’s ruling will not be\n\nreversed absent an abuse of discretion. Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455-56.\n\n¶ 127 Defendant argues that Redmond’s status as a suspect was admissible because the\n\n“essence” of the State’s theory against defendant was that he was not seen in town on the night\n\nof Maria’s abduction, permitting a defense that another man could have been present in town at\n\nthe time with opportunity to commit the crime.\n\n¶ 128 We disagree with defendant as to what the essence of the State’s case was. The essence\n\nof the State’s case was the totality of the circumstances, including: Chapman’s positive\n\neyewitness identification; the fact that defendant lived a block or two from Maria’s house; that\n\n“Johnny” was defendant; that defendant misled authorities about whether his car was disabled;\n\nthat defendant gave an incredible account of his whereabouts to the Seattle detectives; and that\n\n\n\n                                                - 46 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndefendant made admissions about how he killed Maria and disposed of her body in an area with\n\nwhich he was familiar.\n\n¶ 129 We also disagree with defendant that Redmond’s status as a suspect has any relevance.\n\nThere was no showing that Redmond had ever been in Illinois, let alone that he was in or near\n\nSycamore on December 3, 1957. That Redmond’s home was two states away in Nebraska, albeit\n\non Route 20, hardly places Redmond in the vicinity of the crime or in the vicinity of where\n\nMaria’s body was found. Further, Solar’s report was full of wild speculation. Solar noted that\n\nRedmond was fond of wearing “longshoreman type” sweaters and that his nickname was “Billy,”\n\nas if a sweater of any type was similar to the sweater with many colors that Chapman described,\n\nand as if “Billy” were interchangeable with “Johnny.” Also, there was no physical evidence that\n\nMaria was sexually assaulted. It is telling that Solar penned the report for the purpose of\n\nbringing closure to the town of Sycamore on the 40th anniversary of Maria’s disappearance, an\n\nevent that Solar said had “a great impact on our community.” It is apparent that Solar’s report\n\nwas designed to reassure the community that a deceased outsider, not one of their own,\n\ncommitted the crime. Solar even admitted in the report that “[w]e will never know for certain if\n\nRedmond was responsible.”\n\n¶ 130 The present case is unlike People v. Simmons, 372 Ill. App. 3d 735 (2007), upon which\n\ndefendant relies.   In Simmons, the appellate court reversed the trial court’s ruling that the\n\ndefendant’s proffered evidence that Pace committed the crime was too remote and speculative,\n\nwhere police had actually investigated Pace for the crime and where other witnesses, as well as\n\nPace himself, made statements implicating Pace. Simmons, 372 Ill. App. 3d at 746-50. Here,\n\nRedmond was not a suspect at the time of the crime, nor was he a suspect in the 2008\n\ninvestigation that culminated in defendant’s arrest. According to Solar’s report, in 1996, a\n\n\n\n                                             - 47 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nPennsylvania state trooper became convinced that Redmond probably committed the crime, and\n\nthe trooper in turn convinced Solar. However, as we pointed out, nothing but speculation linked\n\nRedmond to the Ridulph case. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding Solar’s testimony.      For the above reasons, we conclude that defendant was not\n\ndeprived of the right to present a defense.\n\n¶ 131                       C. Whether Other Evidence Was Admissible\n\n¶ 132 Defendant next raises the issue of the admissibility of Eileen’s deathbed statement,\n\nLong’s testimony that Johnny had given her piggyback rides, and the evidence that defendant\n\nhad ammunition in his safe when authorities executed the 2011 search warrant at his Seattle\n\nhome.\n\n¶ 133                       1. Eileen’s Deathbed Statement: “John Did It”\n\n¶ 134 We first address the deathbed statement in which Eileen told Janet that “John did it.” The\n\ntrial court admitted Eileen’s statement as a statement against her penal interest, the theory being\n\nthat Eileen lied to the FBI in 1957, when she told them that defendant was at home on the\n\nevening of Maria’s disappearance.             The State theorizes that Eileen’s 1994 statement\n\nacknowledged the 1957 lie and subjected her to possible prosecution for obstruction of justice 37\n\nyears later while she lay dying from metastatic cancer. The State also posits that Eileen could\n\nhave waived any statute of limitations, thus clearing the way for her own prosecution.\n\n¶ 135 A hearsay exception applies to declarations against penal interest. People v. Tenney, 205\n\nIll. 2d 411, 433 (2002). Illinois Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) provides that a\n\nstatement that tends to subject a declarant to civil or criminal liability, and that is corroborated, is\n\nadmissible. Our supreme court in examining Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), which is\n\nidentical to our rule, stated that three conditions must be met before a statement will be admitted\n\n\n\n                                                 - 48 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nunder the rule: (1) the declarant must be unavailable; (2) the declarant’s statement must have\n\nbeen against his or her penal interest; and (3) corroborating circumstances must support the\n\ntrustworthiness of the statement. People v. Rice, 166 Ill. 2d 35, 43 (1995). Whether to admit\n\nevidence is within the trial court’s discretion, and its ruling will not be reversed absent an abuse\n\nof that discretion. Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455-56.\n\n¶ 136 Here, Eileen was unavailable at the time of trial, due to her death. However, we conclude\n\nthat Eileen’s statement was not against her penal interest. The statement itself must, on its face,\n\nbe self-incriminating. People v. Williams, 193 Ill. 2d 1, 19-21 (2000). In Williams, our supreme\n\ncourt stated that under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) only statements “which are\n\nthemselves self-inculpatory” may be admitted. Williams, 193 Ill. 2d at 22. Our supreme court\n\nderived this interpretation from Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 599 (1994), in which\n\nthe United States Supreme Court held that the federal rule covers only “those declarations or\n\nremarks *** that are individually self-inculpatory.”\n\n¶ 137 Eileen’s statement that “John did it” did not, on its face, admit that Eileen had committed\n\na crime.   To reach that interpretation, the State had to introduce the inadmissible hearsay\n\nstatement of what Eileen told the FBI and then speculate that Eileen could have been prosecuted\n\nfor obstruction of justice 37 years later while she lay dying of metastatic cancer. Nothing in\n\neither of Eileen’s statements, either the deathbed statement or the statement to the FBI agents,\n\nwas facially self-inculpatory.   Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting the deathbed\n\nstatement. Because we find error in the statement’s admission pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), we do\n\nnot address defendant’s additional argument that the statement did not meet the trustworthiness\n\nguidelines set forth in Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 49 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 138 The State argues that the admission of Eileen’s statement was harmless error and cites the\n\ngeneral rule that, on review after a bench trial, it is presumed that the trial court considered only\n\nadmissible evidence. See People v. Naylor, 229 Ill. 2d 584, 603 (2008). However, as defendant\n\npoints out, where the trial court admits improper evidence over the defendant’s objection, the\n\npresumption that the trial court considered only admissible evidence is negated. People v.\n\nRobinson, 368 Ill. App. 3d 963, 975 (2006). Nevertheless, error in the admission of evidence is\n\nharmless where there is no reasonable probability that the defendant would have been acquitted\n\nin its absence. People v. Nevitt, 135 Ill. 2d 423, 447 (1990). We agree that the error was\n\nharmless. The trial court did not mention Eileen’s deathbed statement in its ruling, and, as we\n\ndemonstrated in our reasonable-doubt analysis, the evidence apart from Eileen’s statement was\n\nsufficient to allow any rational trier of fact to find that the elements of the offenses had been\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶ 139                   2. Long’s Testimony About Prior Piggyback Rides\n\n¶ 140 We next consider the admissibility of Long’s testimony that a man named Johnny gave\n\nher piggyback rides. Defendant argues that Long’s testimony was irrelevant because she did not\n\nidentify defendant as Johnny and because Long’s piggyback rides occurred a substantial time\n\nbefore December 3, 1957. He also argues that her testimony was prejudicial, because the State\n\nelicited that her father pulled her off Johnny’s back during the last piggyback ride. Defendant\n\ncategorizes Long’s testimony as “other crimes” or “other bad acts” evidence but questions\n\nwhether giving someone a piggyback ride in bucolic 1957 Sycamore was a crime or a bad act.\n\n¶ 141 Prior to trial, the State filed a motion to introduce “conduct” other than that charged in\n\nthe indictment.     The State represented that Long would testify that “everyone in the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nneighborhood knew the defendant as ‘Johnny’ ” and that Long knew him as “Johnny Tessier.”\n\nAt trial, Long did not identify defendant as “Johnny.”\n\n¶ 142 While we do not believe that Long presented other-crimes or other-bad-acts evidence\n\n(despite Long’s father’s ire), we nevertheless agree with the State that her testimony was relevant\n\nas tending to prove Johnny’s identity. Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to\n\nmake the existence of any fact of consequence to the determination of the outcome more\n\nprobable than not. People v. Boclair, 129 Ill. 2d 458, 477 (1989). Evidentiary rulings are within\n\nthe trial court’s sound discretion and will not be disturbed unless the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion. Boclair, 129 Ill. 2d at 476. In our case, the identity of the perpetrator was the only\n\nquestion of consequence, given that the crime itself was not at issue. Long’s testimony tended to\n\nprove that defendant was the perpetrator, for three reasons:       (1) Long’s description of the\n\n“Johnny” who gave her piggyback rides was similar to Chapman’s description of the man who\n\nintroduced himself to her as Johnny, whom Chapman identified as defendant; (2) Long testified\n\nthat the last piggyback ride occurred by “Old Man Tessier’s” house, which was in Long’s\n\nbackyard, thus providing a link to defendant; and (3) Long corroborated Diaz’s testimony that he\n\noverheard defendant say that he gave another little girl a piggyback ride near his grandfather’s\n\nhouse.\n\n¶ 143 Defendant maintains that the significant lapse of time between Long’s piggyback rides\n\nand December 3, 1957, rendered Long’s testimony irrelevant. Long testified that she was in\n\ngrade school when Johnny gave her piggyback rides, which she testified was “way before”\n\nMaria’s disappearance. Defendant’s argument is unpersuasive. As explained above, Long\n\nconnected defendant to Maria’s disappearance with her description of Johnny and by tying\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 51 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nJohnny to defendant’s grandfather’s house. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in allowing Long’s testimony.\n\n¶ 144              3. Testimony That Ammunition Was Found in Defendant’s Safe\n\n¶ 145 Next, we address defendant’s argument that testimony of the presence of ammunition in\n\nhis home safe 50-plus years after the crime was irrelevant and prejudicial. The State apparently\n\nintroduced this evidence to show that the identity of the person who opened the safe was not\n\npublic knowledge, in order to corroborate Swaggerty’s testimony. Defendant does not contest\n\nthe admission of the evidence of who opened the safe, but confines his argument to the\n\nprejudicial impact of the presence of ammunition. We agree with defendant that the evidence of\n\nthe presence of ammunition was irrelevant.      However, we do not agree that the evidence was\n\nprejudicial. There was no showing that defendant’s possession of ammunition was illegal or that\n\na gun played any part in Maria’s abduction and murder.\n\n¶ 146 D. Whether Defendant’s Convictions of Kidnapping and Abduction of an Infant Must Be\n\n                                             Vacated\n\n¶ 147 Defendant’s final contention is that his convictions of kidnapping and abduction of an\n\ninfant must be vacated, as the State failed to prove any exception to those crimes’ three-year\n\nstatutes of limitations in effect in 1957, or, in the alternative, that the conviction of kidnapping\n\nmust be vacated as violating one-act, one-crime principles. The State does not respond on the\n\nmerits but dismisses defendant’s arguments by saying that defendant was not sentenced on the\n\nconvictions of kidnapping and abduction. The record indicates otherwise. In the court’s oral\n\npronouncement, it sentenced defendant to five years’ incarceration for kidnapping and to seven\n\nyears’ incarceration for abduction of an infant. The court then provided that both sentences\n\nwould “merge” into the natural-life sentence for murder. The court’s oral pronouncement was\n\n\n\n                                               - 52 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nmemorialized in a written order dated and filed on December 10, 2012. Because the State, in\n\nessence, concedes that sentences need not enter on these counts, and because it conceded at oral\n\nargument that it did not adduce any proof that would toll or extend the limitations periods, and\n\nfurther does not contend that defendant forfeited the issue, we vacate defendant’s convictions of\n\nkidnapping and abduction of an infant.\n\n¶ 148                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 149 For the reasons stated, we affirm defendant’s murder conviction and vacate his\n\nconvictions of kidnapping and abduction of an infant.\n\n¶ 150 Affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 53 -\n\f",

McCullough, was convicted of the\n\n1957 kidnapping and murder of seven-year-old Maria Ridulph. He appeals. We affirm in part\n\nand vacate in part.\n\n¶2                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶3                       A. December 3, 1957 Through April 26, 1958\n\n¶4     On December 3, 1957, seven-year-old Maria Ridulph lived with her family on Archie\n\nPlace in Sycamore, Illinois. She was a second-grade student at West School. Her friend Kathy\n\nSigman, who lived four or five houses away from Maria, was eight and attended third grade at\n\nWest School. Defendant, who was 18 years of age in 1957 and was known then as John Tessier,\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nlived with his family at 227 Center Cross Street, approximately a block and a half or two blocks\n\nfrom Maria’s house. Sycamore in the 1950s was described by witnesses as a rural farm town, a\n\nplace where people did not lock their doors.\n\n¶5     The corner of Archie Place and Center Cross Street was a gathering place for the\n\nneighborhood children, where they played games like hide-and-seek. There was a large tree at\n\nthat corner, and the corner was lit by a streetlight. After dinner on the evening of Tuesday,\n\nDecember 3, 1957, Maria and Kathy were allowed to play together at the corner, in the season’s\n\nfirst snow. Maria ate dinner at 5 p.m., and Kathy’s dinnertime was 5:30 p.m. At just before 6\n\np.m., Kathy and Maria arrived at the corner and played “duck-the-cars,” a game where they\n\nwould run behind the large tree to avoid being lit up by the headlights of cars on Center Cross\n\nStreet, which was also known as state Route 23.\n\n¶6     At trial in 2012, Kathy was 63 years old. Her married name was Mary Sigman Chapman,\n\nalthough she still went by her nickname, Kathy. Chapman testified that, as she and Maria were\n\nplaying at the corner of Archie Place and Center Cross Street at 6 p.m. on December 3, 1957, a\n\nman approached them, walking from the south. Chapman testified that it was “very, very dark”\n\noutside but that it was not dark on the corner with the streetlight “shining down.” Chapman\n\ndescribed the man who approached them as having a slender face, a flip in the side of his hair,\n\nand large teeth. On cross-examination, Chapman described the man as an “older person,” which\n\nshe clarified as being, to her eight-year-old self, someone twice as old as she was. According to\n\nChapman, the man, whom she did not know, was slender, maybe 150 pounds, and was wearing a\n\nsweater with a lot of colors in it and jeans.\n\n¶7     Chapman testified that the man introduced himself as “Johnny.” Johnny asked the girls if\n\nthey liked dolls and if they would like a piggyback ride. Maria accepted a piggyback ride, and\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nwhen Johnny and Maria returned to the corner, Maria ran home, three doors away, to get a doll.\n\nAccording to Chapman, she observed Johnny under the streetlight while they waited for Maria to\n\nreturn with her doll. Chapman testified that, after Maria ran back to them with her doll,\n\nChapman went home to get mittens for her cold hands. When Chapman got back to the corner,\n\nMaria should have been there but was not.\n\n¶8     Chapman testified that she went to Maria’s house, thinking that Maria had gone home.\n\nAccording to Chapman, Maria’s brother, Charles, said, “She still must be hiding from you,” and\n\ntold her to keep looking for Maria. Chapman testified that she went back outside to look for\n\nMaria but did not find her. At that time, she went to her own home and told her mother about\n\n“Johnny and Maria.” Her mother called the police. According to Chapman, over the next\n\nseveral months the police and the FBI showed her thousands of photographs and took her to\n\npossibly 20 lineups, but she never identified anyone and was never shown a photograph of\n\n“Johnny.”\n\n¶9     Charles, who was 11 years old in 1957, testified that the family ate dinner promptly at 5\n\np.m. and that he and a friend were listening to records after dinner when Chapman came to the\n\ndoor saying that she could not find Maria. Charles also recalled that Maria’s bedtime was\n\nalways at 8 p.m. and that Maria would be in their mother’s room reading books for a period\n\nleading up to her bedtime. Maria did not come home on the night of December 3, 1957. That\n\nnight and the next day, the town organized a search. Still, Maria was not found over the next\n\ndays, weeks, or months. Then, during the weekend of April 26, 1958, Charles was on a camping\n\ntrip when his parents received a telephone call.\n\n¶ 10   On April 26, 1958, James T. Furlong, a funeral director and the coroner of Jo Daviess\n\nCounty, Illinois, assisted in recovering the remains of a female child from among some timber\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nabout a half mile off Route 20 in Jo Daviess County. Furlong, 88 years old at the time of trial,\n\ntestified that the body was found on the ground and that it had some clothes and one sock on it.\n\nAccording to Furlong, the body was “in bad shape from the length of time [it] was out in the\n\ntimber.” Furlong testified that he took the body to his funeral home in Galena, Illinois. Furlong\n\nidentified People’s exhibit No. 10 as a certified copy of the coroner’s inquest report of the death\n\nof Maria Ridulph, dated June 3, 1958. Without objection, the portion of the report that contained\n\nthe autopsy protocol was introduced into evidence.\n\n¶ 11   The autopsy protocol indicated the following. At 11:30 p.m. on the night of April 26,\n\n1958, Dr. K.M. Truemner conducted the autopsy at the Furlong Funeral Home. Furlong, the\n\nDe Kalb County State’s Attorney, and members of the Illinois State Police and the FBI attended\n\nthe autopsy. The body was identified as Maria’s, from dental records. The body lay in a supine\n\nposition on the mortuary table, partially rotated to the left, with the left hip and knee flexed, the\n\nleft arm extended parallel to the body, and the right arm flexed at the elbow and wrist, lying\n\nacross the lower chest and upper abdomen. The right leg was extended and slightly externally\n\nrotated. According to the autopsy protocol, the body was clad in one pair of brownish-tan ankle-\n\nlength socks, a soiled black and white checked shirt, and a cotton knit undershirt.\n\n¶ 12   Dr. Truemner noted that the body was “complete in the sense of skeletal articulation.”\n\nHe noted extensive soft-tissue loss. However, he also noted that the soft tissues were retained\n\nover the right anterior upper chest, right shoulder girdle, and right upper arm to the elbow. The\n\nskin and soft tissues were intact over the posterior surface of the trunk to the level of the lower\n\nrib margins. The viscera were completely absent. The lungs, heart, esophagus, aorta, and\n\nthoracic soft tissues were completely absent “except for remnants of the upper trachea retracted\n\nupwards into the base of the neck.” With respect to the neck organs, Dr. Truemner stated that\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe soft tissues of the neck, including the larynx, “are shrunken into a tough sclerotic [(rigid)]\n\nmass.” Dr. Truemner stated that “dissection is virtually impossible.” He continued, “It is\n\nimpossible to recognize evidence of laryngeal or hyoid fracture” or evidence of interstitial\n\nbleeding in the soft tissues of the cervical prevertebral space. Dr. Truemner examined the head\n\nand found that the bony surface of the “intact” skull “shows no fracture or penetrating wound.”\n\nDr. Truemner found no fracture of the bony skeleton, “with special attention to the skull and\n\ncervical spine.” The only wounds Dr. Truemner found were the results of “known trauma prior\n\nto the subject’s disappearance,” namely, a laceration of the sole of the left foot and a probable\n\nvaccination scar on the left thigh. As to the cause of death, Dr. Truemner concluded that “I can\n\ndraw no conclusion on this subject.” He elaborated by stating that the poor preservation of the\n\nbody due to the effects of the elements and the ravages of small animals “rendered this doubtful\n\nfrom the outset unless the mechanism had been some form of obvious, gross, mechanical\n\ntrauma.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 13   Maria was buried in May 1958. The case went cold for the next 50 years.\n\n¶ </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span>                                 <span class=\"reporter\">Barb.</span> <span class=\"page\">2008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Through 2012\n\n¶ 15   In October 2008, the Illinois State Police began investigating Maria’s disappearance, as a\n\nresult of information supplied by defendant’s half-sister, Janet Tessier.        As part of the\n\ninvestigation, Special Agent Brion Hanley first spoke with Chapman on September 1, 2010, for\n\napproximately an hour and a half. At that meeting, according to Chapman, Hanley asked if she\n\nremembered anything about Maria’s disappearance. Chapman testified that she gave Hanley\n\n“the exact information that I [could] remember back from 1957.” On September 9, 2010, Hanley\n\nshowed Chapman a photo array consisting of six black and white photographs of what appear to\n\nbe teenage males circa the 1950s. All are clean-shaven and smiling, similar in age, with similar\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nhairstyles that might be expected of that era. Chapman identified defendant’s photo as that of the\n\n“Johnny” who gave Maria the piggyback ride on December 3, 1957.\n\n¶ 16   Hanley testified that the photos were obtained from a 1950s yearbook. According to\n\nHanley, he laid the photos down one at a time in front of Chapman. Gradually, Chapman\n\neliminated every photo except number four, which was defendant’s photo. According to Hanley,\n\nChapman picked out number four and said, “That is him.” The photo shows a young man with a\n\nslender face, hair worn short on the sides and longer on top, and prominent teeth.\n\n¶ 17    On June 29, 2011, Sycamore police officers, accompanied by Seattle police officers,\n\nexecuted a search warrant at defendant’s Seattle, Washington, residence. Sycamore sergeant\n\nSteven Cook testified that, while he was in defendant’s residence, he saw defendant’s wife open\n\na safe. Inside the safe was a box of ammunition. According to Sergeant Cook, the fact that\n\ndefendant’s wife opened the safe was never released to the public. On July 1, 2011, an arrest\n\nwarrant was issued for defendant, and extradition proceedings were initiated.\n\n¶ 18   On July 27, 2011, defendant was extradited to Illinois. That same day, Maria’s body was\n\nexhumed and a second autopsy was performed. On August 19, 2011, a grand jury indicted\n\ndefendant on three counts: count I charged him with Maria’s murder (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 38,\n\n¶ 358); count II charged defendant with kidnapping (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 38, ¶ 384); and\n\ncount III charged defendant with abduction of an infant (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 38, ¶ 385).\n\nCounts II and III of the indictment alleged that the applicable limitations periods were tolled due\n\nto defendant’s absence from Illinois for various periods, commencing on December 11, 1957.\n\n¶ 19                                   C. Pretrial Motions\n\n¶ 20   Defendant filed a motion in limine requesting that certain FBI reports that were created\n\nduring the 1957 investigation be admitted on the basis that they contained exculpatory evidence,\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nspecifically evidence of an alibi that had otherwise disappeared due to the witnesses’ deaths.\n\nThe first report reflected that defendant was known as John Samuel Cherry and that the authors\n\nof the report referred to him as “Cherry.”\n\n¶ 21   The first report indicates that the information it contained was received by the FBI via a\n\ntelephone interview on December 10, 1957, with Air Force staff sergeant Jon Oswald. The\n\nreport states that Oswald advised the FBI of the following information, which Oswald had\n\nobtained directly from Cherry. Cherry had been sent to Chicago on December 2, 1957, for a\n\nphysical examination and was rejected by the Air Force because of a spot on his lung. Cherry\n\nstayed over in Chicago and was reexamined on the morning of December 3, 1957, and was again\n\nrejected for the same reason. The Air Force gave Cherry a train ticket to Rockford. At this\n\npoint, Oswald broke off the narrative of what Cherry told him to state his own opinion that\n\nfurnishing a train ticket was a “highly irregular procedure.” Oswald further stated that he\n\ntelephonically contacted “Chicago” to verify Cherry’s story. According to Oswald, he learned\n\nthat the ticket was furnished by the Army Reserve unit located on Van Buren Street, but “no\n\nverification of the information could be obtained at the time of calling.” Oswald then resumed\n\nthe narrative.   Cherry stayed in Chicago on December 3, 1957, visited some burlesque shows,\n\nand then took the 5:15 p.m. train to Rockford, arriving at 6:45 p.m. In Rockford, Cherry\n\ncontacted Colonel Liberwitz of the Air Force Reserve at approximately 7:15 p.m. or 7:30 p.m.\n\nand told Liberwitz that he had been instructed to report to the recruiting office in Rockford.\n\n¶ 22   At this point, the report indicates that Oswald related to the FBI the following\n\nconversation between Oswald and Liberwitz. Liberwitz found Cherry’s story hard to believe,\n\nbecause it was known that the recruiting office was not open in the evening. Cherry gave\n\nLiberwitz the appearance of being a “narcotic,” and Cherry said that he was rejected by the Air\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nForce because he was “unstable.” Liberwitz directed Cherry to contact Technical Sergeant\n\nFroom on the third floor of the recruiting office.\n\n¶ 23   Here, the report indicates that Oswald related his conversation with Froom. Cherry\n\nappeared “bewildered” and looked and acted like a “lost sheep.” Cherry said that he was going\n\nto contact his father to come to Rockford to get him.\n\n¶ 24   Oswald related to the FBI that on December 4, 1957, Cherry returned to the recruiting\n\noffice in Rockford, where Oswald met Cherry for the first time. The following is Oswald’s\n\naccount of that meeting. Cherry mentioned that it was a good thing that he was not in Sycamore\n\nthe night before when the girl disappeared. No details of the disappearance were discussed\n\nexcept for the fact that there had been search parties looking for the girl. Cherry stated that he\n\nwould not be considered a suspect, because his girlfriend’s father was a deputy sheriff. Cherry\n\nhad a “little black book” containing the names and addresses of girls in Sycamore with their bust\n\nand hip sizes. Cherry was wearing an “odd colored flashy” shirt with a string necktie. Cherry\n\nwas not wearing a hat but was wearing a brown jacket. Oswald noted a “slight cut” across\n\nCherry’s upper lip that appeared to be fresh and could have occurred while shaving.\n\n¶ 25   Another FBI report contained the following information pertinent to a possible alibi. On\n\nDecember 8, 1957, defendant’s stepfather, Ralph Tessier, reported that he had discussed with his\n\nwife, Eileen Tessier, that defendant might fall under suspicion because defendant fit the general\n\ndescription of the perpetrator. Ralph reported that defendant was in Rockford at the Air Force\n\nrecruiting office on the evening of December 3, 1957, and had placed a collect call from\n\nRockford to the Tessier home in Sycamore at about 7:10 p.m. Ralph further reported that\n\ndefendant had been in Chicago on the Monday preceding December 3, 1957, and was rejected by\n\nthe Air Force because of a spot on his lung.\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 26   A third FBI report touching upon a possible alibi indicated that Eileen, defendant’s\n\nmother, was interviewed on December 8, 1957, and said that defendant had called home collect\n\nfrom Rockford at 7:10 p.m. on the evening of December 3, 1957, and that Ralph had gone to\n\nRockford to pick up defendant that evening. A fourth report indicated that the general manager\n\nof the Sycamore-Ogle Telephone Company reported that his records reflected that a collect call\n\nwas placed from a certain number in Rockford on December 3, 1957, at approximately 6:57 p.m.\n\nto a number in Sycamore listed to Ralph E. Tessier. The records further revealed that the collect\n\ncall was made by one “John S. Tassier” and that the call lasted until 6:59 p.m. The general\n\nmanager told the FBI that he thought the operator who handled the call had misspelled the name\n\n“Tessier.”\n\n¶ 27   Defendant sought admission of the FBI reports either as ancient documents or as public\n\nrecords, arguing an exception to the rule that police reports are not admissible, because, in this\n\ncase, the defendant rather than the prosecution was seeking their admission. Defendant also\n\nargued that due process required their admission where all of his alibi witnesses were deceased\n\nafter the passage of 55 years. The court denied defendant’s motion to introduce the FBI reports.\n\n¶ 28   The State filed a motion in limine to bar defendant from introducing a former Sycamore\n\npolice lieutenant’s theory that someone other than defendant committed the crime. As the\n\nfortieth anniversary of Maria’s disappearance approached in 1997, Lieutenant Patrick J. Solar\n\npenned a document entitled “Report on the Closure of the Maria Ridulph Kidnap/Murder Case.”\n\nIn the document, Solar opined that a man suspected in a 1951 Pennsylvania murder was “far and\n\naway” the best suspect in the Ridulph case. The suspect, one William Henry Redmond, died in\n\n1992. In the document, Solar stated that the facts of the Pennsylvania case coupled with other\n\nfacts “create a level of certainty that [Redmond] is responsible for [Maria’s] abduction which is\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ngreater than mere suspicion.” In the next paragraph, Solar stated, “We will never know for\n\ncertain if Redmond was responsible for the crime.” At the time of trial, Solar was alive and\n\ncould have testified to what was contained in his document. The trial court granted the State’s\n\nmotion to bar and ruled that Solar’s testimony would have been speculative and remote.\n\n¶ 29   In another motion in limine, the State requested that a 1994 deathbed statement made by\n\nEileen be admitted as a statement against her penal interest. At the time of trial, Eileen was\n\ndeceased. According to the State’s motion, Eileen made the following statement to her daughter\n\nJanet allegedly regarding defendant’s involvement in Maria’s murder: “Those two little girls, one\n\ndisappeared, John did it.” The State contended that, when Eileen made that statement, she\n\nexposed herself to criminal liability, because she had given prior contrary statements to the\n\npolice and the FBI. The court granted the State’s motion to admit the statement as a statement\n\nagainst Eileen’s penal interest.\n\n¶ 30                                   D. The Trial\n\n¶ 31   At trial, Charles and Chapman testified as recounted above. The State also introduced\n\nevidence of the recovery of Maria’s body and the first autopsy as recounted above. In order to\n\nkeep the narrative of the events as chronological as possible, we resume here with the evidence\n\nsurrounding the evening of December 3, 1957, in Sycamore following Maria’s disappearance.\n\n¶ 32   In December 1957, Cheryl Crain was a sophomore at Sycamore High School. After\n\ndinner on December 3, 1957, Crain and her friend Janice Edwards went to Edwards’ father’s\n\nhobby shop in Sycamore to decorate it for Christmas. According to Crain, defendant, who was\n\nEdwards’ boyfriend, was supposed to give Crain a ride home when they finished decorating the\n\nshop. While the girls were decorating, Crain heard police loudspeakers and “knew something\n\nwas going on.” Then Crain’s father called and told her to lock the shop door. Shortly thereafter,\n\n\n\n                                             - 10 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nCrain’s father came to get her and Edwards. Crain testified that she did not see defendant that\n\nnight and that he did not call the shop.\n\n¶ 33   Dennis Twadell lived in Sycamore and was a friend of defendant’s in 1957. According to\n\nTwadell, defendant had a 1948 coupe. Twadell recalled that the coupe was “battleship gray” and\n\nthat defendant would not allow anyone else to drive it. Twadell described defendant in 1957 as\n\nabout 6 feet tall, 150 to 160 pounds, with sandy blond hair worn short. According to Twadell, in\n\nthe winter defendant wore flannel shirts and sweaters.           Twadell testified that defendant’s\n\nsweaters were solid colors or multicolored. Twadell testified that, on the evening of December\n\n3, 1957, he learned from members of his church that Maria was missing and that people were\n\nforming search parties. He testified that he called defendant, who was not at home. Twadell did\n\nnot see defendant that night.      On cross-examination, Twadell admitted that, when he was\n\ninterviewed by the police in 2010, he had no recollection of anything unusual occurring on\n\nDecember 3, 1957, until the police refreshed his recollection.\n\n¶ 34   Katheran Caulfield was known as Katheran Tessier in 1957. Defendant is her half-\n\nbrother. Besides Caulfield and defendant, there were five other siblings plus her parents, Ralph\n\nand Eileen, living at their house, which she described as a “small house” on Center Cross Street\n\nin Sycamore. Caulfield testified that defendant slept on the first floor and that the girls slept in a\n\nconverted attic on the second floor. According to Caulfield, in 1957 defendant was just under 6\n\nfeet tall and “kind of gangly” with wavy hair. She described him as having “like a do-up hairdo\n\non the top.” According to Caulfield, defendant “frequently” wore a multicolored sweater that\n\ntheir mother had knit for him. Caulfield testified that she never saw that sweater again after\n\nDecember 3, 1957.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 35   Caulfield testified that she knew Maria because it was a small neighborhood and all of\n\nthe children played together, although Maria had never come over to the Tessier home.\n\nAccording to Caulfield, because defendant was so much older, he never played with Maria.\n\n¶ 36   Caulfield testified that her father drove her home from a 4-H gathering in De Kalb,\n\nIllinois, at 7 p.m. on December 3, 1957. Caulfield testified that they drove into Sycamore and\n\nsaw a lot of police cars with flashing lights close to Center Cross Street and that there were\n\npeople “outside everywhere walking and looking.” Caulfield testified that she went directly into\n\nher house and that her mother, her sister Jeanne, and her brother Bob were home. According to\n\nCaulfield, her mother and father were “very upset” and went out to search for Maria, while she,\n\nJeanne, and Bob stayed in the living room, with the front door locked. Caulfield testified that the\n\nside door to the house did not lock, so her father secured it with a piece of plywood. According\n\nto Caulfield, by the time she went to bed at 11:30 p.m. or 11:45 p.m., defendant had not come\n\nhome. She testified that she had not seen defendant for “probably” the prior couple of days.\n\n¶ 37   Caulfield testified that Eileen was interviewed by the FBI on December 4, 1957. The\n\ntrial court admitted Caulfield’s description of the conversation because the conversation\n\npertained to Eileen’s deathbed declaration. According to Caulfield, she and Jeanne were present\n\nin the living room for the conversation. Caulfield testified that the FBI agents asked Eileen\n\nabout defendant’s whereabouts the previous evening, December 3, 1957, and that Eileen told the\n\nagents that defendant was home. Caulfield testified that she knew that defendant was not home\n\nthe previous evening.\n\n¶ 38   Caulfield next testified about summer day trips that her family, including defendant, took\n\nevery year. She testified that typical trips would be to Starved Rock State Park or to the Apple\n\nRiver in the Galena area.\n\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 39   Caulfield also testified that in 1957 defendant had a 1940s two-passenger “grayish-\n\nbeigish” coupe with flames painted on the sides. Caulfield recalled that defendant’s coupe was\n\nnot at the home on December 3, 1957. On cross-examination, she said that defendant was not at\n\nhome when she woke up on December 4, 1957.\n\n¶ 40   Jeanne, also defendant’s half-sister, testified that in 1957 defendant was thin and wore his\n\nhair curly on top and swept back on the sides. She testified that defendant played with other\n\nchildren in the neighborhood in approximately 1952, but not in 1957. According to Jeanne,\n\nMaria had never been to the Tessier home and Jeanne had never been to Maria’s home. She\n\nrecalled that on the evening of December 3, 1957, her father went out searching for Maria, and\n\nher mother went to the armory to help make coffee and sandwiches for the searchers. That\n\nevening, according to Jeanne, defendant was not at home. Jeanne testified that she stayed alone\n\nin the living room that night so that she could let her parents in the front door when they came\n\nhome. She testified that she was asleep when her mother came home in the middle of the night.\n\nAccording to Jeanne, a few days later, she was present when her mother spoke with law\n\nenforcement officers in the living room.      Jeanne testified that the officers asked whether\n\ndefendant came home on the evening of December 3, 1957, and that her mother stated that he\n\ndid. According to Jeanne, defendant was not at home that evening. On cross-examination,\n\nJeanne testified that she did not see defendant on the morning of December 4, 1957, although she\n\nmight have seen him sometime during that day.\n\n¶ 41   Pamela Long had lived with her family in Sycamore in the 1950s. She testified that “Old\n\nMan Tessier,” who had no children living with him, lived north of her home, “in [her] backyard.”\n\nLong recalled that Maria disappeared on the evening of December 3, 1957. She also recalled\n\nthat sometime “way before” Maria’s disappearance, when Long was in grade school, a person\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnamed Johnny had given Long piggyback rides. She described Johnny as tall and thin, with\n\n“blondish-brown hair” that had a “flip” in it and “strange teeth, something funny about his\n\nteeth.” On her last piggyback ride with Johnny, her father caught her and “jerked” her off\n\nJohnny’s back.\n\n¶ 42   At this point in the narrative, we leave the 1950s and go forward to January 1994. Janet\n\ntestified that Eileen was hospitalized with cancer for two weeks before her death in January\n\n1994. According to Janet, the hospitalization occurred because Eileen was pulling out her IVs\n\nand could not be cared for at home. According to Janet, sometime during that hospitalization,\n\nwhen Janet’s sister Mary was present, Janet was sitting at the foot of her mother’s hospital bed\n\nwhen Eileen said, “Janet.” Janet testified that she jumped out of her chair and went close to her\n\nmother. According to Janet, Eileen grabbed her wrist and said, “Those two little girls and the\n\none that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone. You have to tell\n\nsomeone.”\n\n¶ 43   According to Janet, she contacted the Sycamore police and the FBI but nothing\n\nhappened. Then, in 2008, Janet contacted the Illinois State Police and they followed up on her\n\ninformation.\n\n¶ 44   On cross-examination, Janet testified that she was one year old in 1957 and had no\n\nrecollection of the events surrounding Maria’s disappearance. She also agreed that her mother\n\nnever told her how she claimed to know the information she imparted to Janet in the hospital\n\nroom and that she did not ask her mother that question. Janet admitted that her mother was\n\n“disturbed emotionally” while hospitalized. However, on redirect examination, Janet testified\n\nthat her mother was coherent when she made the statement. Janet testified that, in her “own\n\nopinion,” her mother was “lucid” at that point.\n\n\n\n                                              - 14 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 45      Our narrative now jumps to July 27, 2011, when two events occurred: defendant was\n\nextradited from Washington to Illinois, and Maria’s body was exhumed and re-autopsied. We\n\nfirst detail the evidence at trial relating to the Seattle investigation and the extradition.\n\n¶ 46      Seattle detective Irene Lau interviewed defendant at the Seattle police department on\n\nJune 29, 2011. She had already been briefed on the reason for defendant’s presence in the\n\nSeattle police station. Lau testified that when she interviewed defendant he alternated between\n\n“rage and calm” and “was pretty angry.” According to Lau, when she asked defendant if he had\n\nknown Maria or her family, he described Maria as being “very stunningly beautiful with big\n\nbrown eyes.” Further, defendant stated that Maria was “lovely, lovely, lovely.” He appeared to\n\nbe discussing Maria “as if he was talking about someone he had been deeply, deeply in love\n\nwith.” Defendant objected to the characterization, and the objection was sustained. Lau then\n\ntestified that, when defendant made those statements about Maria, “his entire face changed.”\n\nAccording to Lau, whereas defendant’s body had been “quite rigidly stiff” during questioning, he\n\n“had just totally relaxed” when he talked about Maria. On cross-examination, Lau testified that\n\ndefendant vehemently denied any involvement in Maria’s abduction and that he was upset when\n\nhe was accused of being involved.\n\n¶ 47      Seattle homicide detectives Cloyd Steiger and Michael James Ciesynski accompanied\n\ndefendant from Seattle to Sycamore on July 27, 2011. According to the detectives, defendant\n\ntalked the entire time. Steiger described a lot of the conversation with defendant as “chitchatty\n\nstuff.”     However, defendant also discussed matters relevant to Maria’s disappearance.\n\nAccording to Steiger, defendant described Maria as “a beautiful little Barbie doll.”\n\n¶ 48      Steiger testified that defendant talked about his whereabouts on the day Maria was\n\nabducted. Defendant asked the detectives to note how long it took to get from Chicago to\n\n\n\n                                                 - 15 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nSycamore. Defendant stated that he had hitched a ride from Chicago to Rockford, because\n\nRockford was close to Sycamore, and that he called his dad from Rockford. When Steiger asked\n\ndefendant if he made the phone call from the train station in Rockford, defendant responded,\n\n“Oh, no, no, no, I never took the train anywhere that day.”\n\n¶ 49     According to Steiger, while they were en route to Sycamore from O’Hare Airport, they\n\nstopped at a restaurant because defendant was hungry. Ciesynski sat with defendant, and Steiger\n\nsat at a nearby table eavesdropping on defendant’s conversation.        Steiger took notes on a\n\nplacemat. They left the restaurant and defendant talked some more about the case on the ride to\n\nSycamore. Steiger testified that defendant told them about the car he had in 1957 and how\n\nnobody else drove that car. Defendant told Steiger that he last saw Maria when she was five\n\nyears old, standing near the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place. Defendant told\n\nMaria to get away from the road.\n\n¶ 50     When they arrived in Sycamore, they drove to the intersection of Center Cross Street and\n\nArchie Place. Defendant pointed out his old house. According to Steiger, defendant pointed to a\n\nwindow and said, “That’s the window I crawled in that night right there.” Defendant said that he\n\nhad hitchhiked from Rockford to Sycamore when his father could not pick him up in Rockford.\n\nSteiger testified that defendant stated that his family was surprised to see him the next morning.\n\nWhen Steiger asked defendant why he crawled through a window, defendant replied that no one\n\nwas watching and that Sycamore then was “Happy Days.”\n\n¶ 51     On cross-examination, Steiger testified that defendant had denied involvement in the\n\ncrime.    On redirect examination, Steiger testified that Ciesynski at one point suggested to\n\ndefendant the “possibility” that defendant had given Maria piggyback rides on the evening she\n\ndisappeared but that someone else came along and kidnapped her.            According to Steiger,\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndefendant paused for “a couple moments and thought,” and then responded, “No, I never gave\n\nher a piggyback ride.” Then, in response to a question on re-cross-examination, Steiger amended\n\nhis answer and said that defendant responded, “That didn’t occur.”\n\n¶ 52   Ciesynski’s testimony was similar to Steiger’s. Ciesynski testified that defendant told\n\nthem that he “could not have done it,” because he was in Chicago at the time. According to\n\nCiesynski, when defendant called Maria a “beautiful little Barbie doll,” defendant was\n\n“glowing.” Ciesynski wondered aloud whether someone else could have picked Maria up after\n\ndefendant gave her a piggyback ride and left. According to Ciesynski, defendant “sat back kind\n\nof reflectively,” then said, “No, didn’t happen like that.”\n\n¶ 53   We move now to the testimony relating to the other event of July 27, 2011, the\n\nexhumation and second autopsy of Maria’s body. The State did not introduce a report from the\n\npathologist. The State called Dr. Krista Latham, a forensic anthropologist, as its only witness\n\nregarding the 2011 findings.\n\n¶ 54   Dr. Latham was present at the exhumation, and she attended the autopsy. She testified\n\nthat the pathologist did not cut any of the bones during the autopsy. Following the autopsy, Dr.\n\nLatham removed the soft tissue and debris from the bones and then transported the bones to her\n\nlaboratory in Indianapolis for examination. Through dental records, Dr. Latham established that\n\nthe skeleton was Maria’s.\n\n¶ 55   Dr. Latham described the cuts on the bones from the original 1958 autopsy. She then\n\ndescribed three “cutting events” beneath the throat area and in the deep chest region that were\n\nnot related to the 1958 autopsy and had been inflicted with a blade larger than a scalpel, such as a\n\nknife. According to Dr. Latham, these cutting events were also called “sharp force trauma.” Dr.\n\nLatham testified that the cut marks appeared on the front of the back bones. Dr. Latham could\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnot say whether the “cutting events” occurred at the time of death, although she acknowledged\n\nthat her report stated that they might have resulted from trauma inflicted at that time. Nor was\n\nshe able to testify regarding the time of death. Dr. Latham also was unable to recover any\n\n“transfer” DNA, due to DNA degradation that occurred because of water in the casket. On\n\ncross-examination, Dr. Latham testified that she is not an expert in pathologies of soft tissues and\n\nthat she does not examine soft tissues. Rather, she examines hard tissues, being bones and teeth.\n\nDr. Latham testified that she did not read the 1958 autopsy report to look for evidence of ligature\n\nmarks or soft-tissue trauma. Dr. Latham was not asked whether her opinions were rendered\n\nwithin a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n\n¶ 56   The State also introduced evidence through Sycamore police detective Daniel Hoffman\n\nregarding the proximity of the Apple River to the site where Maria’s body was found near\n\nGalena. According to Hoffman, the area on the north side of Route 20, where Maria’s body was\n\nfound, is wooded.\n\n¶ 57   The remainder of the State’s case centered on statements defendant made to inmates of\n\nthe De Kalb County jail. The State’s first inmate witness was Christopher Diaz, who was\n\nincarcerated on a charge of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Diaz had prior convictions of\n\nattempted mob action (reduced from felony mob action) and felony possession of a fraudulent\n\nidentification card. Diaz denied being a gang member.\n\n¶ 58   Diaz testified that in September 2012 he overheard some conversations between\n\ndefendant and Diaz’s cellmate, known as John Doe at trial. According to Diaz, defendant told\n\nDoe that he was giving “the victim” a piggyback ride down an alley and that “the other girl”\n\nwent inside to grab mittens. Diaz testified that he next overheard defendant say that he “had the\n\nvictim in his house for quite a while and that his mom knew about it.” According to Diaz, the\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnext thing he overheard was defendant describing “how he killed the victim, the little girl, saying\n\nhe strangled her with [a] wire.” Then, according to Diaz, defendant said that he hid the girl.\n\nDiaz testified that in another conversation defendant said that he hit the girl on the head but her\n\nskull was “intact.” According to Diaz, in yet another conversation, defendant stated that in order\n\nto “throw people off” he was telling people that he did not have a car, when defendant actually\n\nhad a car with flames painted on it. Diaz testified that at one point defendant was “mad” at the\n\nState’s Attorney and wanted to kill him. According to Diaz, at one time the State had offered\n\ndefendant a deal and defendant said “Fuck that.” Diaz testified that defendant thought that the\n\nState had no evidence except from his mother, who was dead, and a sister, whom he called a\n\n“dumb bitch.” Diaz testified that defendant admitted to giving another girl a piggyback ride at\n\nhis grandfather’s house. Defendant asked Diaz and Doe if they could “do anything” to Kirk\n\nSwaggerty, who was to be a witness against defendant. Finally, Diaz testified that the State had\n\nnot offered him anything for his testimony. On cross-examination, Diaz admitted that there was\n\nan immigration hold on him and that he could be deported. Diaz denied that he thought his\n\nhelpful testimony would benefit him; he said that he had contacted the State’s Attorney because\n\nit was the right thing to do. Diaz also admitted to having pleaded guilty to the charge of being in\n\ncontact with gang members.\n\n¶ 59   The second inmate witness was John Doe. Doe had been convicted of murder, home\n\ninvasion, criminal damage to property, and two counts of unlawful possession of a weapon by a\n\nfelon. According to Doe, between the dates of August 30, 2012, and September 5, 2012, he had\n\nmany conversations with defendant. Doe testified that after he denied knowing anything about\n\ndefendant or his case, and after Doe told defendant that he could not do anything about the\n\nwitnesses who were going to testify against him, defendant “got into details.”\n\n\n\n                                              - 19 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 60    Doe testified that defendant said that he first met “the little girl” along with another little\n\ngirl and that one had to go inside to get her gloves or her “mitts.” Defendant said that he gave\n\nthe other little girl a piggyback ride down an alley behind a building. Defendant fell, and the girl\n\nhit her head and started crying or yelling. Doe testified that defendant said that it was an\n\naccident but that he did not tell anyone about it because no one would believe him. Doe testified\n\nthat defendant stated that he crawled through a window into his house and pulled the little girl\n\nthrough the window, where he “had” her inside his bedroom, something his mother knew about.\n\nAccording to Doe, defendant said that he choked the little girl and then later said that he choked\n\nher with a wire. Doe testified that defendant told him that he put the little girl in his coupe, drove\n\nto Jo Daviess County, and got rid of the body by placing it by some fallen trees. Defendant\n\nstated that he lied about not having the car at that time and also lied about it having a flat tire.\n\n¶ 61    Doe testified that, in their next conversation, defendant was angry and giddy, “almost\n\nchild-like.” Doe testified that defendant got “amped up” when he talked about the little girl.\n\nAccording to Doe, at another time defendant said that most “serious” criminals “like murderers”\n\ncan draw, and then defendant said about himself and Doe, “We can both draw.” In still another\n\nconversation, according to Doe, defendant said that he had called the FBI with a false story,\n\ntrying to lead them in the wrong direction. On cross-examination, Doe denied that he had been\n\npromised anything for his testimony, but he admitted that he had a pending petition asking for a\n\nreduction in his sentence.\n\n¶ 62    Swaggerty was the last inmate witness. He had been convicted of murder and possession\n\nof a weapon by a felon in 2011. Swaggerty testified that the “whole jail” was talking about\n\ndefendant, who was on the news and was being extradited to Illinois. According to Swaggerty,\n\ndefendant introduced himself as the man in the news and then “just began talking.”\n\n\n\n                                                 - 20 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 63   Swaggerty testified that he asked defendant if he was going to “take a plea,” and that\n\ndefendant replied that he could probably get probation because “it was an accident.” According\n\nto Swaggerty, defendant said that he was giving the little girl a piggyback ride when she fell.\n\nDefendant stated that she would not stop screaming and that she accidentally suffocated while\n\ndefendant was trying to keep her quiet. Defendant said that he had at one time called the FBI\n\nwith a story about a dream in which a “guy named ‘Johnny’ did this” to the girl. According to\n\nSwaggerty, defendant then admitted that he was “Johnny.”\n\n¶ 64   Swaggerty also testified that defendant told him details about the investigation in Seattle,\n\nspecifically that defendant’s wife opened the house safe for the police. Swaggerty recalled that\n\ndefendant started to “stare off” during another conversation and then said, “She was a very pretty\n\ngirl,” which Swaggerty found “creepy.” According to Swaggerty, defendant’s demeanor was\n\n“normal” until he started to talk about the little girl. On cross-examination, Swaggerty admitted\n\nthat in a petition to reconsider his sentence he cited his cooperation in the case against defendant\n\nas a basis for leniency. Swaggerty also admitted that he wrote letters to the authorities offering\n\ntestimony against other defendants. On redirect examination, Swaggerty testified that defendant\n\nstated that the State did not have DNA but that, “if they find some,” he would talk about a plea\n\nbargain.\n\n¶ 65   The State’s last witness placed the inmate witnesses and defendant in the jail at the times\n\nof the conversations testified to, and the State rested. Defendant moved for a directed finding,\n\nwhich was denied.\n\n¶ 66   Defendant’s first witness was a jail employee who testified that, according to jail records,\n\nDiaz was a member of the Ambrose street gang.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 67   Next, defendant’s half-sister Mary Hunt testified for defendant. She was present in\n\nEileen’s hospital room when Eileen made the statement regarding defendant to which Janet\n\ntestified. According to Mary, Eileen was “basically comatose.” Mary heard Eileen say only,\n\n“He did it,” without saying who “he” was or what “it” was. Eileen did not answer Mary’s\n\nfollow-up questions. On cross-examination, Mary admitted that Eileen had lucid periods during\n\nher hospitalization.\n\n¶ 68   Defendant’s last witness was Dr. John Prabhakar, the surgeon who had implanted an IV\n\nin Eileen’s neck for the administration of morphine during her January 1994 hospitalization. Dr.\n\nPrabhakar testified that morphine causes confusion, and the doctor noted in Eileen’s chart that\n\nshe was “pleasantly confused.” He also noted that she was “disoriented.” The records showed\n\nthat Eileen was also on Haldol, which the doctor testified could cause confusion. The doctor\n\nnoted that there was a diagnosis of “unspecified psychosis” in the medical record. On cross-\n\nexamination, Dr. Prabhakar testified that he had spent a total of about 30 minutes with Eileen\n\nwhen he inserted the IV and that he could not testify to what she was like on other occasions.\n\nDefendant then rested, and the State presented no rebuttal.\n\n¶ 69   In ruling, the trial court found all of the witnesses credible. The court found the inmate\n\nwitnesses credible even though it found that they were “all bad guys,” that they “all belong in\n\nprison,” and that “they all hope to benefit from their testimony.” The court found that the State\n\nhad not offered them anything in exchange for their testimony. The court further found that,\n\nwhile there was no proof of cause of death in the record, it would draw the inference that\n\nstabbing was the cause of death. The court found Chapman’s eyewitness identification “most\n\nconvincing.” The court found that some witnesses’ memories had dimmed with time but that\n\nthis was “to be expected after these many years.” Based on the totality of the evidence, the court\n\n\n\n                                              - 22 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nfound defendant guilty on all three counts of the indictment. Under the 1957 statutes, the court\n\nsentenced defendant to natural life in the Illinois Department of Corrections on count I, murder;\n\nto five years’ incarceration on count II, kidnapping; and to seven years’ incarceration on count\n\nIII, abduction of an infant. The court ordered that the sentences for kidnapping and abduction of\n\nan infant “merge” with the sentence for murder. Defendant filed a timely appeal.\n\n¶ 70                                  II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 71         A. Whether Defendant Was Proved Guilty Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\n\n¶ 72   Defendant first contends that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He\n\nargues that Chapman’s eyewitness identification 53 years after the crime was not credible and\n\nthat none of the other witnesses with recollections from the 1950s offered any probative evidence\n\nof defendant’s guilt. Defendant argues that the inmate witnesses were incredible due to their\n\nmotivations to lie, their accounts’ internal inconsistencies, the inconsistencies between their\n\naccounts and the physical evidence, and their exposure to the publicity about the case.\n\n¶ 73   In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not retry the case. People v. Milka,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2021809\"><a href=\"/opinion/2021809/people-v-milka/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Rather, the proper inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.       Jackson v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318-19 (1979);\n\nHolmes, 141 Ill. 2d at 239.\n\n¶ 74   In a bench trial, the judge determines the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be\n\ngiven to the witnesses’ testimony, and the judge draws reasonable inferences from the evidence.\n\nPeople v. Slim, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2077178\"><a href=\"/opinion/2077178/people-v-slim/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307 (1989). A conviction may be sustained only if the evidence\n\n\n\n                                              - 23 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nsufficed to show that the defendant committed the crime. Milka, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 227. In\n\nmaking such inquiry, it is improper to segregate each piece of evidence in a circumstantial case\n\nand try to locate the doubt therein. Milka, 336 Ill. App. 3d at 229. To the contrary, the evidence\n\nis sufficient if all of it, taken together, satisfied the trier of fact that the defendant is guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Milka, 336 Ill.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (2006).\n\n¶ 75   Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the following facts: (1) Maria met her death by criminal means;\n\n(2) Maria was abducted from the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place shortly after 6\n\np.m. on December 3, 1957, by “Johnny”; (3) defendant was “Johnny”; and (4) defendant killed\n\nMaria and disposed of her body in Jo Daviess County.\n\n¶ 76   The State must prove the corpus delicti by competent evidence beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. People v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2242929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2242929/the-people-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596 (1961). In a murder case, the corpus delicti consists\n\nof the fact of death and the fact that death was caused by the criminal agency of some person.\n\nJones, 22 Ill. 2d at 595. The corpus delicti can be established by direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence. Jones, 22 Ill. 2d at 596. That Maria died is a certainty. The first autopsy established\n\nthrough dental records that the body found in the timber in Jo Daviess County was Maria’s. In\n\n2011, Dr. Latham reestablished through dental records that the exhumed body was Maria’s. The\n\nrecord contains no cause of death. Dr. Latham could not say whether the cutting events she\n\nfound occurred at the time of death. The most she could say was that the cutting events might\n\n\n\n                                               - 24 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nhave resulted from trauma inflicted at the time of death. Dr. Latham did not so opine within a\n\nreasonable degree of scientific certainty. Nevertheless, the court found that stabbing was the\n\ncause of death. While the inference that stabbing was the cause of death was not supported by\n\nthe evidence, the evidence had to establish only that Maria met her death by a criminal agency.\n\nSee Jones, 22 Ill. 2d at 596 (the question is not the method of proving cause of death but whether\n\nthe fact that death was caused by a criminal agency has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt).\n\nGiven that Maria was only seven years old and that her body was found far from home four\n\nmonths after her disappearance, concealed deep among the timber and posed unnaturally, and\n\ngiven that she was badly decomposed and ravaged by small animals, a rational trier of fact could\n\ninfer that she met her death by a criminal agency. Accordingly, the corpus delicti was proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶ 77   A second reasonable conclusion that the trial court could have drawn was that “Johnny”\n\nabducted Maria. Maria was last seen shortly after 6 p.m. on December 3, 1957, at the corner of\n\nCenter Cross Street and Archie Place. Chapman testified that “Johnny” approached them at 6\n\np.m., he gave Maria a piggyback ride, and Maria ran home, three doors away, and ran back to the\n\ncorner with her doll. Then Chapman went home for her mittens, leaving Maria in Johnny’s\n\ncompany. In the short interval between when Chapman went home, which was also nearby, and\n\nwhen she returned to the corner, Maria had vanished. There was traffic on Center Cross Street,\n\nbut only “Johnny” had been on the corner with Maria when Chapman last saw her. Thus, the\n\ncentral question of the trial was the identification of “Johnny.”\n\n¶ 78   The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the person who\n\ncommitted the charged offense.       People v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066235/people-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (1995).      Chapman\n\ndescribed “Johnny” as having a slender face, with a flip in the side of his hair and large teeth,\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nand weighing 150 pounds. Chapman said that “Johnny” was an older person, but she was eight\n\nand considered someone twice her age to be “older.” Chapman described the sweater that\n\n“Johnny” wore as having a lot of colors in it. In 2010, Chapman identified defendant as\n\n“Johnny.”\n\n¶ 79   While Chapman was the only eyewitness, the State’s case did not rest solely on her\n\nidentification of defendant. Long’s description of “Johnny” was similar to Chapman’s. Long\n\ntestified that “Johnny” was tall and thin, had blondish-brown hair with a flip in it, and had\n\nstrange teeth. Caulfield described defendant in 1957 as just under 6 feet tall, kind of gangly,\n\nwith wavy hair. Caulfield said that defendant frequently wore a multicolored sweater. Twadell\n\ndescribed defendant in the 1950s as 6 feet tall, 150 to 160 pounds, with sandy blond hair.\n\nTwadell also recalled that defendant wore multicolored sweaters.\n\n¶ 80    A single eyewitness’s identification of the accused is sufficient to sustain a conviction if\n\nthe eyewitness viewed the accused under conditions permitting a positive identification. Lewis,\n\n165 Ill. 2d at 356. Our supreme court in Lewis relied on the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), for assessing identification testimony. Lewis, 165 Ill. 2d at 356. Those\n\nfactors include: (1) the witness’s opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the\n\nwitness’s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior description of the criminal;\n\n(4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification confrontation; and (5)\n\nthe length of time between the crime and the identification. Lewis, 165 Ill. 2d at 356.\n\n¶ 81   Chapman and Charles testified that the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place\n\nwas well lit by a streetlight. Chapman saw Johnny as he walked up to them from the south and\n\nspoke to them. She watched Johnny give Maria a piggyback ride down the street and then come\n\nback to the corner. She stood with Johnny, observing him under the streetlight, while Maria\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nwent home to get her doll. She had an adequate opportunity to view Johnny, so the first factor\n\nweighs in the State’s favor. Chapman also paid attention to Johnny, making the second factor\n\nweigh in the State’s favor. The third factor, the accuracy of Chapman’s prior description, also\n\nweighs in the State’s favor. Chapman described the man as having a slender face, a flip in the\n\nside of his hair, and large teeth. The photograph of defendant that she identified as “Johnny”\n\nshows a teenager with a slender face, curly or wavy hair, and large teeth. The fourth factor, the\n\nwitness’s level of certainty, also weighs in the State’s favor. Hanley showed Chapman the\n\nphotographs, which were all similar, by laying them down one-by-one, individually, on her\n\ncoffee table. Chapman gradually eliminated all but defendant’s picture. She told Hanley, “That\n\nis him.” After Maria’s disappearance, the police and the FBI for weeks and months showed\n\nChapman thousands of mug shots and took her to lineups. Yet, she said, she was never shown a\n\npicture of Johnny until Hanley showed her defendant’s photo. The fifth factor, however, the\n\nlength of time between the crime and the identification, weighs in defendant’s favor.\n\n¶ 82   In our research, we did not find a case resembling the span of time that we have here\n\nbetween the observation and the identification. Defendant cites Dallas County v. Commercial\n\nUnion Assurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"252947\"><a href=\"/opinion/252947/dallas-county-v-commercial-union-assurance-company-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (5th Cir. 1961), where, in a completely different\n\ncontext, the court assumed that a witness would not recall the details of a fire 58 years later. We\n\nare not permitted to make such an assumption, because our supreme court has held that the lapse\n\nof time goes to the weight of the testimony, which is for the trier of fact to determine, and does\n\nnot destroy the witness’s credibility. People v. Rodgers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2031059\"><a href=\"/opinion/2031059/people-v-rodgers/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214 (1972). Chapman\n\nnot only had the ability to observe defendant on December 3, 1957, she had an excellent reason\n\nto remember him for all the years afterward. She was a witness to an event that horrified the\n\ncommunity and caused her to be the object of law enforcement and news media attention (a\n\n\n\n                                              - 27 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nnewspaper photo of her in her mittens is in evidence). For a time the police even accompanied\n\nher to Sunday school, making their presence in her life onerous. As we discussed above, her\n\nidentification was sufficiently corroborated. Defendant attempts to cast doubt on Chapman’s\n\ncredibility now by arguing that People’s exhibit No. 80, a photograph, which appears to be a\n\nnewspaper photo taken in the 1950s, of the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie Place, does\n\nnot show a streetlight. Chapman was not impeached on that point at trial, and we cannot tell\n\nfrom the photograph whether there is a streetlight. However, Charles corroborated Chapman’s\n\ntestimony that the corner was well lit.\n\n¶ 83   In assessing Chapman’s testimony, defendant relies on People v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2439415\"><a href=\"/opinion/2439415/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 596 (2008). However, in Williams, the evidence “rested solely on the hesitant testimony of\n\ntwo minors” who were substantially prodded “through vigorous leading questions” and whose\n\ntestimony was riddled with “internal inconsistencies and self-contradictions.” Williams, 383 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 638. To the contrary, Chapman was an adult when she testified, her testimony was\n\nclear, not hesitant, the State did not have to prod or lead her, and her testimony was not internally\n\ninconsistent or self-contradictory. Nor did her testimony conflict with that of other witnesses.\n\nWe discussed above how remarkably similar her description of defendant was to those given by\n\nLong, Twadell, and Caulfield. For the same reasons, defendant’s reliance on People v. Broome,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970), is misplaced. In Broome, a 15-year-old eyewitness’s testimony was\n\nfound wanting where the identification occurred in the dark, in pouring rain, and when the\n\neyewitness was not wearing his eyeglasses. Broome, 130 Ill. App. 2d at 228-29.\n\n¶ 84   Defendant maintains that the other witnesses from the 1950s added nothing to the State’s\n\ncase. We disagree. The people close to defendant expected him to be around on the night Maria\n\ndisappeared but could not account for his whereabouts that night. Crain expected defendant to\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndrive her home that night after she and Edwards finished decorating Edwards’ father’s hobby\n\nshop, yet she neither saw nor heard from him. Twadell called defendant as soon as he heard that\n\nMaria was missing, but defendant was not at home. Jeanne and Caulfield testified that defendant\n\ndid not come home that night. They did not see him the next morning either.\n\n¶ 85   Other things were missing. Caulfield testified that, after Maria disappeared, Caulfield\n\nnever again saw the multicolored sweater that defendant had frequently worn. She also testified\n\nthat defendant’s coupe was not at the home that night. The coupe’s absence was significant in\n\nlight of Twadell’s testimony that defendant never allowed anyone else to drive it. A rational\n\ntrier of fact could infer that defendant was somewhere unknown to anyone close to him and that\n\nhe was in possession of his coupe that night. That inference takes on significance in light of\n\nCaulfield’s testimony that defendant was familiar with the area where Maria’s body was found.\n\n¶ 86   Defendant does not even discuss the Seattle detectives’ testimony, much less question\n\ntheir credibility. Yet, defendant made crucial statements to Steiger and Ciesynski regarding his\n\nwhereabouts on the day and night of Maria’s disappearance. Defendant said that he hitchhiked\n\nfrom Chicago to Rockford and then hitchhiked from Rockford to Sycamore. He told Steiger that\n\nhe crawled through a window into his house and surprised his family the next morning. When\n\nSteiger asked why he climbed through a window, defendant did not answer the question but said\n\nthat no one was looking and that Sycamore was “Happy Days.” The trial judge could have found\n\ndefendant’s version of his whereabouts incredible, especially in light of Jeanne’s and Caulfield’s\n\ntestimony that they did not see him the next morning. Further, when defendant told Steiger that\n\nhe never allowed anyone else to drive his coupe, defendant corroborated Twadell’s testimony.\n\nThe significance of this admission becomes apparent in light of Caulfield’s testimony that\n\ndefendant’s coupe was not at the home on the night Maria disappeared. If defendant was driving\n\n\n\n                                              - 29 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe coupe, he was not hitchhiking.

Ciesynski suggested to\n\ndefendant that after defendant gave Maria a piggyback ride someone else might have come along\n\nand taken her, to which defendant replied after some reflection, “No, didn’t happen that way.”\n\nDefendant’s statement could be construed to mean that he was not present at the scene or did not\n\ngive Maria a piggyback ride. Or it could be construed to mean that defendant was present at the\n\nscene and knew exactly what happened.\n\n¶ 88   Defendant argues that the jail inmates’ testimony was unworthy of belief. Yet, after\n\nacknowledging that they all were “bad” people, criminals who deserved to be in prison and who\n\nhoped for leniency, the trial court found them credible.      “[I]t is quite established that the\n\ncredibility of a government informant, as with any other witness,” is a question for the trier of\n\nfact. People v. Manning, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2074839\"><a href=\"/opinion/2074839/people-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (1998).\n\n¶ 89    Defendant posits that “so much” of what the inmates said “was based on what was\n\nalready public knowledge.” This statement is not borne out by the record. Swaggerty testified\n\nthat the whole jail was talking about the man who, according to the news, was being extradited to\n\nDe Kalb County, but Swaggerty did not testify to what, if any, details of the crime the inmates\n\nlearned from the news. Swaggerty testified only that it was “obvious” that defendant was\n\ncharged with a 50-year-old murder. Then, said Swaggerty, defendant “just began talking.” The\n\nfirst time defendant met Doe, he asked Doe if he had heard of him or seen anything on TV. Doe\n\n\n\n                                              - 30 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nanswered no. Defendant asked Doe if he knew about a 1956 or 1957 murder of which defendant\n\nwas accused, and Doe said no. Diaz did not indicate that he had any preexisting knowledge of\n\nthe crime.\n\n¶ 90   Defendant argues that the inmates’ testimony concerning the manner of death conflicted\n\nwith Dr. Latham’s testimony. Diaz overheard defendant say that he strangled Maria with a wire.\n\nDefendant told Doe that Maria hit her head when defendant slipped and fell during a piggyback\n\nride, that defendant pulled Maria inside his house through a window, and that he “had” her inside\n\n“the bedroom,” after which he choked her with a wire. Swaggerty testified that defendant told\n\nhim that Maria accidentally suffocated after she fell during a piggyback ride and would not stop\n\nscreaming.\n\n¶ 91   The evidence does not show how Maria died. At the first autopsy Dr. Truemner said that\n\nhe could not opine on the cause of death, because of the advanced state of decomposition and the\n\nravages from small animals. Dr. Truemner could not tell whether the hyoid bone or the larynx\n\nwas fractured. Dr. Truemner did not find any form of “obvious, gross, mechanical trauma.” He\n\ndid not find three stab wounds.\n\n¶ 92   While Dr. Latham found “sharp force trauma,” neither autopsy ruled out ligature\n\nstrangulation, because Dr. Latham, as a forensic anthropologist, did not examine the soft tissues\n\nof the neck area, and Dr. Truemner stated that dissection of them was virtually impossible due to\n\nthe effects of decomposition. Thus, nothing in the forensic evidence is inconsistent with the\n\ninmates’ testimony regarding defendant’s statements.        Defendant argues that the forensic\n\nevidence does not show a skull injury and thus contradicts Diaz’s testimony that defendant said\n\nthat he hit Maria on the head. However, Diaz also heard defendant say that Maria’s “skull was\n\nintact” after the blow, an interesting choice of words since Dr. Truemner had stated that the skull\n\n\n\n                                              - 31 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nwas “intact,” a fact that Diaz would not know unless defendant had discussed the matter in front\n\nof Diaz.\n\n¶ 93   We recognize that defendant gave Doe and Swaggerty slightly different versions of how\n\nhe killed Maria. However, the variances are not such that they raise a reasonable doubt of\n\ndefendant’s guilt, because none of the versions was impossible under the evidence, as was the\n\ncase in People v. Lindsey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2160576\"><a href=\"/opinion/2160576/people-v-lindsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979). In Lindsey, the court reversed the\n\ndefendant’s murder conviction where the defendant had confessed to “rapes of two girls later\n\nfound to be virgins; a stabbing of which there was no supporting evidence; strangulation by rope\n\nof which there was no evidence; arson by use of an accelerant for which there was no supporting\n\ntestimony; and aggravated assault on parts of a body which bore equivocal evidence of such an\n\ninjury.” Lindsey, 73 Ill. App. 3d at 448. In Lindsey, the court declared that the prosecution’s\n\nevidence taxed “even the gullibility of the credulous.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\nLindsey, 73 Ill. App. 3d at 448. That was not the case here. Dr. Truemner in 1958 could not\n\ndissect the soft tissues of the neck, so he did not opine with respect to any injuries or lack thereof\n\nin that area. Dr. Latham is a forensic anthropologist. She examined the bones. She specifically\n\ntestified that she did not examine the soft tissues of the neck. Thus, the evidence does not\n\ncontradict the testimony that defendant stated that he strangled Maria with a wire.\n\n¶ 94   Furthermore, the inmates testified to details that were too obscure to mean anything to\n\nthem unless defendant had related them to the inmates in context.             Swaggerty knew that\n\ndefendant’s wife opened their home safe when the police executed the search warrant in Seattle,\n\nsomething only defendant could have told him. Diaz overheard defendant tell Doe that to throw\n\npeople off he told people that he did not have a car, when in actuality he had a car with flames\n\npainted on it. Defendant told Doe how he had deceived people by saying that his car had been\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndisabled, when in reality he had used the car to transport Maria’s body to Jo Daviess County.\n\nDefendant told Doe and Swaggerty that he had deliberately misled the FBI by planting false\n\nstories. Attempts to deflect the investigation prove consciousness of guilt. People v. Ehlert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006693\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006693/people-v-ehlert/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (2004).\n\n¶ 95   Evidence of threats to intimidate or kill witnesses is also proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\nPeople v. Rogers, 2014 IL App (4th) 121088, ¶ 21. Defendant asked Diaz and Doe if they could\n\n“do anything about” the witnesses who were going to testify against him, and defendant\n\nspecifically named Swaggerty. Diaz also said that defendant was “mad” at the State’s Attorney\n\nand wanted to kill him.\n\n¶ 96   Further, Swaggerty knew that defendant used to go by the name “Johnny” and Diaz knew\n\nthat defendant gave another little girl a piggyback ride at his grandfather’s house.          That\n\ndefendant was the “Johnny” who gave Long a piggyback ride near “Old Man Tessier’s” house in\n\nLong’s backyard is something that only defendant could have told the inmates.\n\n¶ 97   Defendant claims that it is incredible that a man would identify himself before\n\ncommitting a serious crime. However, the evidence showed that defendant singled out very\n\nyoung girls. It happened that one of them remembered him for the rest of her life. Defendant\n\ncites People v. Dawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2226112\"><a href=\"/opinion/2226112/the-people-v-dawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1961), but that case is inapposite. In Dawson, our\n\nsupreme court found it incredible that the defendant, a police officer and a person of good\n\ncharacter and reputation, would commit an armed robbery after identifying himself in an office\n\nwhere he was well known. Dawson, 22 Ill. 2d at 265. Our supreme court said that this was\n\nespecially so where the defendant made no attempt to flee the scene. Dawson, 22 Ill. 2d at 265.\n\nIn our case, Chapman did not know defendant. The evidence showed that defendant was much\n\nolder than Maria and that he had not played with her. The evidence also showed that Maria and\n\n\n\n                                              - 33 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nChapman attended public school, whereas the Tessier children attended parochial school.\n\nDefendant risked nothing by introducing himself as “Johnny” in an effort to ingratiate himself\n\nwith two very young grade schoolers. Further, defendant might not have planned the crime at\n\nthe time he introduced himself.\n\n¶ 98    Defendant argues that the prosecution failed to exclude the possibility that the man who\n\ngave Maria a piggyback ride left the area and then someone else came by the scene and abducted\n\nher. He cites People v. Holsapple, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2178598\"><a href=\"/opinion/2178598/people-v-holsapple/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975), for the proposition that the State\n\nmust exclude the possibility that someone else committed the crime. However, Holsapple used\n\nthe reasonable-hypothesis-of-innocence standard of review. Holsapple, 30 Ill. App. 3d at 990\n\n(“In order to sustain the conviction, the evidence must exclude any reasonable hypothesis of\n\ninnocence.”). This standard of review was rejected by our supreme court in People v. Pintos,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230641\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230641/people-v-pintos/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (1989). In Pintos, our supreme court held that “the reasonable hypothesis of\n\ninnocence standard of review is no longer viable in Illinois. Instead, we find that the reasonable\n\ndoubt test as set forth in People v. Collins (1985), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248588\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248588/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261, should be applied in\n\nreviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in all criminal cases, whether the evidence is direct or\n\ncircumstantial.” Pintos, 133 Ill. 2d at 291. In Collins, our supreme court, following Jackson,\n\n443 U.S. at 319, held that the “relevant question is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Emphasis in original and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted.) Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261. Consequently, the State did not have to exclude the\n\npossibility that someone else could have appeared on the scene and abducted Maria. At oral\n\nargument, defendant agreed that Collins sets forth the correct standard of review.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 34 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 99     Defendant contends that all of the evidence permits only the conclusion that he had the\n\nopportunity to commit the crime, as did others. Defendant cites People v. Dowaliby, 221 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 788 (1991). However, in Dowaliby, the court named another person who had the\n\nopportunity to commit the murder. Dowaliby, 221 Ill. App. 3d at 798. Here, defendant names\n\nno one else.     Also, in Dowaliby, the State’s only evidence was of opportunity and an\n\nidentification of the defendant’s nose structure and car. Dowaliby, 221 Ill. App. 3d at 797. Here,\n\nChapman identified defendant’s entire face, and her description of defendant was consistent with\n\ndefendant’s appearance in 1957 and with Long’s description of “Johnny.” While the evidence\n\nshowed that there were cars traveling on Center Cross Street at 6 p.m. on December 3, 1957, the\n\nevidence also showed that no one was present at the corner except defendant and the two little\n\ngirls.\n\n¶ 100 Finally, defendant relies on People v. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, in which this\n\ncourt reversed the defendant’s murder conviction. Rivera is distinguishable. In Rivera, the\n\nphysical evidence recovered from the scene was not matched to the defendant. Rivera, 2011 IL\n\nApp (2d) 091060, ¶ 29.       Perhaps most important, DNA determined conclusively that the\n\ndefendant was not the source of the sperm found inside the victim. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d)\n\n091060, ¶ 30. Against all of this exculpatory evidence, we said that the testimony of the\n\njailhouse informants was incredible. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, ¶ 39. Here, as we\n\ndiscussed above, the forensic evidence did not tend to exonerate defendant. In Rivera, the\n\njailhouse informants had testified only that the defendant had admitted that he committed the\n\nmurder, without further details. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, ¶ 14. In stark contrast, the\n\ninmate witnesses in our case divulged a wealth of minutiae that could have come only from\n\ndefendant—that defendant used a 1948 coupe with flames painted on it to transport Maria’s\n\n\n\n                                              - 35 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nbody; that defendant gave another little girl piggyback rides at his grandfather’s house; that\n\ndefendant lied about whether he had a car at the time of Maria’s disappearance; that defendant’s\n\nwife opened the safe during the execution of the search warrant in Seattle; and that defendant\n\nplanted false stories with the FBI. In Rivera, we said that jailhouse informants’ testimony should\n\nbe treated with caution. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d) 091060, ¶ 36. Here, the trial court followed\n\nthat admonition but still found the inmates’ testimony credible. Their credibility was for the trier\n\nof fact to determine and could be the basis for a finding of guilt. Rivera, 2011 IL App (2d)\n\n091060, ¶ 36. Furthermore, our supreme court recently affirmed that the testimony of jailhouse\n\ninformants is not to be viewed as inherently unbelievable. People v. Belknap, 2014 IL 117094,\n\n¶ 55.\n\n¶ 101 Having examined the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, as we are required\n\nto do, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for any rational trier of fact to find that all of\n\nthe essential elements of the crimes were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶ 102          B. Whether Defendant Was Deprived of the Right to Present a Defense\n\n¶ 103 Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in excluding certain FBI reports and\n\nSolar’s testimony indicating that at one time the police had another suspect. Defendant contends\n\nthat the exclusion of this evidence deprived him of his right to present a defense.\n\n¶ 104   A criminal defendant has a right to a meaningful opportunity to present a complete\n\ndefense. Holmes v. South Carolina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145659\"><a href=\"/opinion/145659/holmes-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331 (2006). The United States Supreme\n\nCourt has held that this right is violated by state evidentiary rules that infringe upon a “weighty\n\ninterest of the accused” and are “arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed\n\nto serve.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Holmes, 547 U.S. at 324. While the Constitution\n\nprohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules “that serve no legitimate purpose or that\n\n\n\n                                                - 36 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nare disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote,” other, well-established rules\n\nof evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by other\n\nfactors, such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.\n\nHolmes, 547 U.S. at 326. It is, of course, within the trial court’s discretion to determine whether\n\nevidence is admissible, and the court’s decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. People v. Garcia, 2012 IL App (2d) 100656, ¶ 17. A trial court abuses its discretion\n\nwhen its decision is arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, or when no reasonable person would\n\ntake the trial court’s view. Garcia, 2012 IL App (2d) 100656, ¶ 17.\n\n¶ 105                                 1. The FBI Reports\n\n¶ 106 We first consider the admissibility of the FBI reports. Defendant posits that, due to the\n\npassage of so much time, crucial witnesses and documents that established his alibi had\n\ndisappeared, making the introduction of the FBI reports appropriate, even necessary, in a search\n\nfor the truth. Defendant maintains that the FBI reports place him in Rockford when Maria was\n\nabducted. Defendant sought to introduce the FBI reports on two grounds: that they are ancient\n\ndocuments and that they are public records. It is incumbent upon the party offering hearsay to\n\nestablish that it meets the requirements of an exception. Garcia, 2012 IL App (2d) 100656, ¶ 20.\n\n¶ 107 Illinois Rule of Evidence 803(16) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) provides that statements in a\n\ndocument in existence 20 years or more, the authenticity of which is established, are not\n\nexcluded by the hearsay rule. At the hearing on defendant’s motion to admit the FBI reports, the\n\nState conceded the documents’ authenticity, and it is not disputed that the documents have been\n\nin existence more than 20 years. We have found no Illinois case that governs this issue, although\n\nthe State relies on cases holding that police reports are inadmissible as substantive evidence\n\nbecause they are generated in anticipation of litigation and thus lack trustworthiness and\n\n\n\n                                              - 37 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nreliability.

The risk of deception is further compounded when we consider that defendant was the\n\nsource of the first part of the “alibi,” the train trip that defendant told Oswald he took from\n\nChicago to Rockford, and that defendant’s parents were the source of the second part of\n\ndefendant’s “alibi,” the 7:10 p.m. collect call and Ralph’s picking defendant up in Rockford.\n\nOne of the underpinnings of the ancient-document exception to the hearsay rule is that an\n\nassertive statement found in an ancient document is more likely to be truthful because it was\n\nwritten before the current motive to fabricate arose. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 805. However,\n\ndefendant and his parents had a motive to fabricate when they gave their alibi statements in\n\n1957. If, when the document was written, a motive for misrepresentation already existed, the\n\ndocument can be excluded under Illinois Rule of Evidence 403 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) as unfairly\n\nprejudicial. See Ultratec, Inc. v. Sorenson Communications, Inc., No. 13-cv-346-bbc, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">4829173</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (W.D. Wis. Sept. 29, 2014) (document that otherwise qualifies as an ancient\n\ndocument may be excluded under Rule 403 where a motive for misrepresentation existed when\n\nthe document was written).\n\n¶ 110 We agree with Hicks that the better view is that each layer of hearsay contained in an\n\nancient document must be excused by its own hearsay exception. This is the view adopted by\n\nour own Seventh Circuit in United States v. Hajda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751367\"><a href=\"/opinion/751367/united-states-v-bronislaw-hajda/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (7th Cir. 1998) (the\n\nadmissibility exception applies only to the document itself; if a document contains more than one\n\nlevel of hearsay, an appropriate exception must be found for each level). The court in Hajda\n\nfound this to be consistent with Federal Rule of Evidence 805, which provides that hearsay\n\nincluded within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined\n\n\n\n                                             - 39 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nstatements conforms to an exception. Illinois Rule of Evidence 805 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) is\n\nidentical. If we were to read Rule 803(16) as inoculating multiple levels of hearsay, Rule 805\n\nwould be superfluous. See Columbia First Bank, FSB v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 338\n\n(2003). In other words, ordinarily Rule 803(16) applies only where the declarant is the author of\n\nthe ancient document. Columbia, 58 Fed. Cl. at 338.\n\n¶ 111   For this reason, we reject defendant’s reliance on Dallas County, 286 F.2d at 390-91,\n\nwhere the court admitted a 58-year-old newspaper article about a fire, and his reliance on State v.\n\nSargent, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3684599\"><a href=\"/opinion/3937194/state-v-sargent/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ohio Ct. App. 1998), where police reports were admitted as ancient\n\ndocuments. In Dallas County, the newspaper article was admitted to show that the Dallas\n\nCounty courthouse in Selma, Alabama, was damaged by fire in 1901. Aside from any double\n\nhearsay, the character of the matter sought to be proved by the newspaper article—that the\n\ncourthouse was damaged by fire—is not susceptible to the pitfalls of recent fabrication.\n\nContrariwise, the “alibi” contained in the FBI reports depends almost entirely on defendant’s\n\nown account of his actions and the accounts given by his parents.\n\n¶ 112 In Sargent, in a hearing to determine whether the defendant was a repeat violent offender\n\nunder Ohio law, the trial court admitted out-of-state police reports under the ancient-document\n\nexception to the hearsay rule. Sargent, 710 N.E.2d at 1175. Contrary to our holding today that\n\neach layer of hearsay must be excused by its own exception, the court in Sargent imposed no\n\nsuch requirement. In our view, satisfying the mere procedural requirements of the exception\n\ndoes not ensure trustworthiness or reliability. For this reason, we believe that the approach the\n\ncourt took in Sargent is unworkable. “The dangers of hearsay relate to flaws in perception,\n\nmemory, narration, and sincerity.” Rehm v. Ford Motor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (Ky. Ct. App.\n\n2011) (Caperton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, we agree that the\n\n\n\n                                              - 40 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nancient-document exception is “not a wide open door but a narrow crevice.” Rehm, 365 S.W.3d\n\nat 579 (Caperton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Consequently, the FBI reports\n\nwere not admissible under Rule 803(16).\n\n¶ 113 We next consider whether the FBI reports were admissible as public documents under\n\nIllinois Rule of Evidence 803(8) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011), which permits, as a hearsay exception, the\n\nadmission of records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of a public office or\n\nagency as to the activities of the office or agency or matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed\n\nby law as to which matters there was a duty to report. Defendant concedes that the second part\n\nof Rule 803(8) excludes police reports. Nevertheless, linking the admission of the FBI reports to\n\nhis right to call witnesses in his defense, he argues that the purpose of the exclusion, the\n\nprotection of a defendant’s rights of confrontation and cross-examination, disappears when the\n\ndefendant seeks their admission. The dangers and weaknesses of the multiple hearsay contained\n\nin the FBI reports were detailed above. Shifting the ground upon which admissibility is urged\n\ndoes not erase the inherent flaws. Multiple hearsay remains multiple hearsay, and it is not\n\nadmissible under Rule 805 unless each layer of hearsay is excused by its own exception.\n\nDefendant cites no case holding that the right to call witnesses includes the right to present\n\nmultiple hearsay.\n\n¶ 114 We conclude that the exclusion of the FBI reports did not violate defendant’s right to\n\npresent a defense, for two reasons: (1) the rule of evidence prohibiting their admission is not\n\narbitrary, and (2) even if the FBI reports had been admitted, they do not tend to exonerate\n\ndefendant. Holmes held that the Constitution prohibits the “exclusion of defense evidence under\n\nrules that serve no legitimate purpose.” Holmes, 547 U.S. at 326. The rule against hearsay is\n\ngrounded in the necessity of cross-examination, and it is a basic rather than a technical rule.\n\n\n\n                                              - 41 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nGrand Liquor Co. v. Department of Revenue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056967\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056967/grand-liquor-co-v-dept-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (1977). Allowing rank hearsay\n\nor multiple hearsay, without any means of testing its veracity through cross-examination, would\n\nlead to the unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and potential to mislead that Holmes\n\nidentified as legitimate reasons to exclude evidence. At the heart of this issue is defendant’s\n\ndesire to present an alibi defense without allowing the State the opportunity for cross-\n\nexamination.   That desire is understandable, given that his 1957 “alibi” could have been\n\nimpeached by statements he made in 2011, as we discuss below.\n\n¶ 115 Further, the FBI reports do not tend to support an alibi defense, because they are\n\ninconsistent and inconclusive.   A defendant presents an alibi when he presents competent\n\nevidence that he was at a specified place other than the crime scene at the time of the offense.\n\nPeople v. Colts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 691 (1993).

The defendant must account for his whereabouts for the time during which the\n\nact could have been consummated. People v. Van Dyke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237079\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237079/people-v-van-dyke/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (1953). Chapman\n\ntestified that defendant approached her and Maria at the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie\n\nPlace in Sycamore at 6 p.m.\n\n¶ 116 In 1957, defendant told Oswald that he was on a train from Chicago to Rockford at 6\n\np.m., arriving at 6:45 p.m. Oswald repeated defendant’s story to the FBI, but neither Oswald nor\n\nthe FBI confirmed it. Indeed, Oswald stated that, although he learned that the Army Reserve\n\nunit on Van Buren Street in Chicago had issued the train ticket, “no verification of the\n\ninformation could be obtained at the time of calling,” and Oswald stated that it was highly\n\nirregular that such a ticket would have been issued. Thus, the story of the train ticket is\n\nconfusing, and it is less than clear whether defendant was even issued a ticket. Consequently,\n\n\n\n                                             - 42 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nthe FBI report does not cover defendant’s whereabouts at 6 p.m.         More important, in 2011,\n\ndefendant himself debunked the story that he was on a train.        Steiger asked defendant if he\n\ncalled home that evening from the Rockford train station. Defendant replied, “Oh, no, no, no, I\n\nnever took the train anywhere that day.”\n\n¶ 117 Oswald related to the FBI that defendant “apparently proceeded” from the train station to\n\nthe post office in Rockford, where he “personally contacted” Liberwitz. However, that contact\n\nwas made, according to Oswald, at 7:15 or 7:30 p.m., well after Maria’s abduction, because\n\nshortly after 7 p.m. Caulfield saw police cars at the corner of Center Cross Street and Archie\n\nPlace in Sycamore. Defendant’s meeting with Froom would have occurred even later than 7:15\n\nor 7:30 p.m.\n\n¶ 118 Similarly, the telephone calls that Ralph and Eileen reported receiving at 7:10 p.m.\n\noccurred significantly after Maria’s abduction.        Further, the FBI report detailing Eileen’s\n\nstatement in which she reported that Ralph picked defendant up in Rockford was contradicted by\n\ndefendant himself when, in 2011, he told Steiger that he hitchhiked from Chicago to Rockford\n\nand then hitchhiked from Rockford to Sycamore and climbed into his house, unnoticed, through\n\na window. Defendant’s hitchhiking story is also at odds with his December 4, 1957, statement to\n\nOswald that he was not in Sycamore on the night of December 3.\n\n¶ 119 The only FBI report containing information that could conceivably have been useful to\n\ndefendant at trial was the one concerning the 6:57 p.m. telephone call, although it does not cinch\n\nan alibi for 6 p.m. and is inconsistent with Ralph’s and Eileen’s reports that the call was made at\n\n7:10 p.m. However, the report contains three levels of hearsay: the telephone company’s general\n\nmanager’s statement as to what the telephone records showed; the telephone records; and the\n\ncaller’s statement supplying his name to the operator.\n\n\n\n                                              - 43 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 120 Arguably, the telephone records could have been admitted under Illinois Rule of\n\nEvidence 803(6) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) as business records if they existed and had a proper\n\nfoundation.    See United States v. Towns, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408-09 (5th Cir. 2013) (proper\n\nfoundation for business record is laid by affidavit that attests to the requisite elements of Rule\n\n803(6)). Pursuant to Rule 803(6), records are not excluded by the hearsay rule if they were made\n\nat or near the time by a person with knowledge; if they were kept in the course of a regularly\n\nconducted business activity; and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make\n\nthe record. Ill. R. Evid. 803(6) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011).\n\n¶ 121 Unfortunately, the FBI did not procure the actual telephone records but relied solely on\n\nthe general manager’s representation as to what they contained. Furthermore, multiple hearsay is\n\nexcused by Rule 803(6) only where both the source and the recorder of the information, as well\n\nas every other participant in the chain producing the record, are acting in the regular course of\n\nbusiness.

Tex. 2013) (if customer surveys fell within business-\n\nrecords exception to hearsay rule, the contents of the surveys were hearsay because the sources\n\nof the contents were outsiders). Thus, if the source of the information is an outsider, Rule 803(6)\n\ndoes not, by itself, permit the admission of the business record. Wilson, 939 F.2d at 271. The\n\noutsider’s statement must fall within another hearsay exception to be admissible, because it does\n\nnot have the presumption of accuracy that statements made during the regular course of business\n\nhave. Wilson, 939 F.2d at 271.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 44 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 122 Here, defendant sought to show not only that a telephone call was made at 6:57 p.m. from\n\na number in Rockford to a number listed to Ralph Tessier in Sycamore but that he made the call.\n\nAccording to the FBI report, the call was collect, meaning that it went through an operator.\n\nNecessarily, the person making the call gave the operator a name. The person making the call\n\nwould be an outsider not acting in the regular course of the telephone company’s business. The\n\noperator generally would have no personal knowledge of the caller. Therefore, the name of the\n\ncaller would not be covered by Rule 803(6). The accuracy of the information in the FBI report is\n\nfurther diluted by the fact that the operator wrote the name “Tassier,” and it was only the\n\nmanager’s opinion that the operator had misspelled “Tessier.”\n\n¶ 123 Furthermore, the record shows that defendant’s alibi, as he related it to Steiger and\n\nCiesynski in July 2011, was placed before the trier of fact. Defendant told Ciesynski that he was\n\nin Chicago. During the trip from Seattle, he kept emphasizing to the detectives to pay attention\n\nto how much time it took to get from Chicago to Sycamore. Defendant told Steiger that he\n\nhitchhiked from Chicago to Rockford because Rockford was close to Sycamore; that he called\n\nhis father from Rockford but his father could not pick him up; and that he hitchhiked from\n\nRockford to Sycamore. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court’s denial of the motion to\n\nadmit the FBI reports.\n\n¶ 124                             2. Patrick Solar’s Testimony\n\n¶ 125   Defendant next contends that it was error to exclude Solar’s testimony regarding a\n\nsuspect that the Sycamore police developed in 1996. Defendant wanted to call Solar to testify\n\nthat the facts of a 1951 murder in Pennsylvania “closely matched” the Ridulph case. In the\n\nPennsylvania case, according to Solar’s 1997 report, Redmond, a transient laborer employed by a\n\nlocal carnival, was suspected of “tempting” an eight-year-old girl away from a carnival ride and\n\n\n\n                                             - 45 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nsexually assaulting her. The Pennsylvania case went cold until 1988. Redmond’s fingerprint\n\nwas found in the truck in which the victim was found. According to Solar’s report, while he was\n\nin jail in 1988, Redmond made comments about being involved in “one other” child abduction\n\ncase. Solar speculated that “this could have been the Ridulph case.” Redmond died in Nebraska\n\nin 1992 without ever standing trial for the 1951 murder. Solar noted that Redmond had been a\n\ntruck driver and that Route 20 extended west into Nebraska where Redmond lived.\n\n¶ 126 An accused may, within certain limits, attempt to prove that someone else committed the\n\ncrime with which he is charged. People v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2027803\"><a href=\"/opinion/2027803/people-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (1984). The test of\n\nadmissibility is whether the evidence “fairly tends” to prove the particular offense with which the\n\ndefendant is charged. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455. The court\n\nmay reject the offered evidence as irrelevant “if it has little probative value due to its remoteness,\n\nuncertainty or its possibly unfair prejudicial nature.” Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455. It is within the\n\ncourt’s sound discretion whether to admit such evidence, and the court’s ruling will not be\n\nreversed absent an abuse of discretion. Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455-56.\n\n¶ 127 Defendant argues that Redmond’s status as a suspect was admissible because the\n\n“essence” of the State’s theory against defendant was that he was not seen in town on the night\n\nof Maria’s abduction, permitting a defense that another man could have been present in town at\n\nthe time with opportunity to commit the crime.\n\n¶ 128 We disagree with defendant as to what the essence of the State’s case was. The essence\n\nof the State’s case was the totality of the circumstances, including: Chapman’s positive\n\neyewitness identification; the fact that defendant lived a block or two from Maria’s house; that\n\n“Johnny” was defendant; that defendant misled authorities about whether his car was disabled;\n\nthat defendant gave an incredible account of his whereabouts to the Seattle detectives; and that\n\n\n\n                                                - 46 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\ndefendant made admissions about how he killed Maria and disposed of her body in an area with\n\nwhich he was familiar.\n\n¶ 129 We also disagree with defendant that Redmond’s status as a suspect has any relevance.\n\nThere was no showing that Redmond had ever been in Illinois, let alone that he was in or near\n\nSycamore on December 3, 1957. That Redmond’s home was two states away in Nebraska, albeit\n\non Route 20, hardly places Redmond in the vicinity of the crime or in the vicinity of where\n\nMaria’s body was found. Further, Solar’s report was full of wild speculation. Solar noted that\n\nRedmond was fond of wearing “longshoreman type” sweaters and that his nickname was “Billy,”\n\nas if a sweater of any type was similar to the sweater with many colors that Chapman described,\n\nand as if “Billy” were interchangeable with “Johnny.” Also, there was no physical evidence that\n\nMaria was sexually assaulted. It is telling that Solar penned the report for the purpose of\n\nbringing closure to the town of Sycamore on the 40th anniversary of Maria’s disappearance, an\n\nevent that Solar said had “a great impact on our community.” It is apparent that Solar’s report\n\nwas designed to reassure the community that a deceased outsider, not one of their own,\n\ncommitted the crime. Solar even admitted in the report that “[w]e will never know for certain if\n\nRedmond was responsible.”\n\n¶ 130 The present case is unlike People v. Simmons, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), upon which\n\ndefendant relies.   In Simmons, the appellate court reversed the trial court’s ruling that the\n\ndefendant’s proffered evidence that Pace committed the crime was too remote and speculative,\n\nwhere police had actually investigated Pace for the crime and where other witnesses, as well as\n\nPace himself, made statements implicating Pace. Simmons, 372 Ill. App. 3d at 746-50. Here,\n\nRedmond was not a suspect at the time of the crime, nor was he a suspect in the 2008\n\ninvestigation that culminated in defendant’s arrest. According to Solar’s report, in 1996, a\n\n\n\n                                             - 47 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nPennsylvania state trooper became convinced that Redmond probably committed the crime, and\n\nthe trooper in turn convinced Solar. However, as we pointed out, nothing but speculation linked\n\nRedmond to the Ridulph case. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding Solar’s testimony.      For the above reasons, we conclude that defendant was not\n\ndeprived of the right to present a defense.\n\n¶ 131                       C. Whether Other Evidence Was Admissible\n\n¶ 132 Defendant next raises the issue of the admissibility of Eileen’s deathbed statement,\n\nLong’s testimony that Johnny had given her piggyback rides, and the evidence that defendant\n\nhad ammunition in his safe when authorities executed the 2011 search warrant at his Seattle\n\nhome.\n\n¶ 133                       1. Eileen’s Deathbed Statement: “John Did It”\n\n¶ 134 We first address the deathbed statement in which Eileen told Janet that “John did it.” The\n\ntrial court admitted Eileen’s statement as a statement against her penal interest, the theory being\n\nthat Eileen lied to the FBI in 1957, when she told them that defendant was at home on the\n\nevening of Maria’s disappearance.             The State theorizes that Eileen’s 1994 statement\n\nacknowledged the 1957 lie and subjected her to possible prosecution for obstruction of justice 37\n\nyears later while she lay dying from metastatic cancer. The State also posits that Eileen could\n\nhave waived any statute of limitations, thus clearing the way for her own prosecution.\n\n¶ 135 A hearsay exception applies to declarations against penal interest. People v. Tenney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2024971\"><a href=\"/opinion/2024971/people-v-tenney/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (2002). Illinois Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) provides that a\n\nstatement that tends to subject a declarant to civil or criminal liability, and that is corroborated, is\n\nadmissible. Our supreme court in examining Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), which is\n\nidentical to our rule, stated that three conditions must be met before a statement will be admitted\n\n\n\n                                                 - 48 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nunder the rule: (1) the declarant must be unavailable; (2) the declarant’s statement must have\n\nbeen against his or her penal interest; and (3) corroborating circumstances must support the\n\ntrustworthiness of the statement. People v. Rice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066343\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066343/people-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1995). Whether to admit\n\nevidence is within the trial court’s discretion, and its ruling will not be reversed absent an abuse\n\nof that discretion. Ward, 101 Ill. 2d at 455-56.\n\n¶ 136 Here, Eileen was unavailable at the time of trial, due to her death. However, we conclude\n\nthat Eileen’s statement was not against her penal interest. The statement itself must, on its face,\n\nbe self-incriminating. People v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2077052\"><a href=\"/opinion/2077052/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19-21 (2000). In Williams, our supreme\n\ncourt stated that under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) only statements “which are\n\nthemselves self-inculpatory” may be admitted. Williams, 193 Ill. 2d at 22. Our supreme court\n\nderived this interpretation from Williamson v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117868\"><a href=\"/opinion/117868/williamson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599 (1994), in which\n\nthe United States Supreme Court held that the federal rule covers only “those declarations or\n\nremarks *** that are individually self-inculpatory.”\n\n¶ 137 Eileen’s statement that “John did it” did not, on its face, admit that Eileen had committed\n\na crime.   To reach that interpretation, the State had to introduce the inadmissible hearsay\n\nstatement of what Eileen told the FBI and then speculate that Eileen could have been prosecuted\n\nfor obstruction of justice 37 years later while she lay dying of metastatic cancer. Nothing in\n\neither of Eileen’s statements, either the deathbed statement or the statement to the FBI agents,\n\nwas facially self-inculpatory.   Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting the deathbed\n\nstatement. Because we find error in the statement’s admission pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), we do\n\nnot address defendant’s additional argument that the statement did not meet the trustworthiness\n\nguidelines set forth in Chambers v. Mississippi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 49 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\n¶ 138 The State argues that the admission of Eileen’s statement was harmless error and cites the\n\ngeneral rule that, on review after a bench trial, it is presumed that the trial court considered only\n\nadmissible evidence. See People v. Naylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2231413\"><a href=\"/opinion/2231413/people-v-naylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (2008). However, as defendant\n\npoints out, where the trial court admits improper evidence over the defendant’s objection, the\n\npresumption that the trial court considered only admissible evidence is negated. People v.\n\nRobinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975 (2006). Nevertheless, error in the admission of evidence is\n\nharmless where there is no reasonable probability that the defendant would have been acquitted\n\nin its absence. People v. Nevitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155807\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155807/people-v-nevitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (1990). We agree that the error was\n\nharmless. The trial court did not mention Eileen’s deathbed statement in its ruling, and, as we\n\ndemonstrated in our reasonable-doubt analysis, the evidence apart from Eileen’s statement was\n\nsufficient to allow any rational trier of fact to find that the elements of the offenses had been\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶ 139                   2. Long’s Testimony About Prior Piggyback Rides\n\n¶ 140 We next consider the admissibility of Long’s testimony that a man named Johnny gave\n\nher piggyback rides. Defendant argues that Long’s testimony was irrelevant because she did not\n\nidentify defendant as Johnny and because Long’s piggyback rides occurred a substantial time\n\nbefore December 3, 1957. He also argues that her testimony was prejudicial, because the State\n\nelicited that her father pulled her off Johnny’s back during the last piggyback ride. Defendant\n\ncategorizes Long’s testimony as “other crimes” or “other bad acts” evidence but questions\n\nwhether giving someone a piggyback ride in bucolic 1957 Sycamore was a crime or a bad act.\n\n¶ 141 Prior to trial, the State filed a motion to introduce “conduct” other than that charged in\n\nthe indictment.     The State represented that Long would testify that “everyone in the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 50 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nneighborhood knew the defendant as ‘Johnny’ ” and that Long knew him as “Johnny Tessier.”\n\nAt trial, Long did not identify defendant as “Johnny.”\n\n¶ 142 While we do not believe that Long presented other-crimes or other-bad-acts evidence\n\n(despite Long’s father’s ire), we nevertheless agree with the State that her testimony was relevant\n\nas tending to prove Johnny’s identity. Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to\n\nmake the existence of any fact of consequence to the determination of the outcome more\n\nprobable than not. People v. Boclair, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2220145\"><a href=\"/opinion/2220145/people-v-boclair/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477 (1989). Evidentiary rulings are within\n\nthe trial court’s sound discretion and will not be disturbed unless the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion. Boclair, 129 Ill. 2d at 476. In our case, the identity of the perpetrator was the only\n\nquestion of consequence, given that the crime itself was not at issue. Long’s testimony tended to\n\nprove that defendant was the perpetrator, for three reasons:       (1) Long’s description of the\n\n“Johnny” who gave her piggyback rides was similar to Chapman’s description of the man who\n\nintroduced himself to her as Johnny, whom Chapman identified as defendant; (2) Long testified\n\nthat the last piggyback ride occurred by “Old Man Tessier’s” house, which was in Long’s\n\nbackyard, thus providing a link to defendant; and (3) Long corroborated Diaz’s testimony that he\n\noverheard defendant say that he gave another little girl a piggyback ride near his grandfather’s\n\nhouse.\n\n¶ 143 Defendant maintains that the significant lapse of time between Long’s piggyback rides\n\nand December 3, 1957, rendered Long’s testimony irrelevant. Long testified that she was in\n\ngrade school when Johnny gave her piggyback rides, which she testified was “way before”\n\nMaria’s disappearance. Defendant’s argument is unpersuasive. As explained above, Long\n\nconnected defendant to Maria’s disappearance with her description of Johnny and by tying\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 51 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nJohnny to defendant’s grandfather’s house. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in allowing Long’s testimony.\n\n¶ 144              3. Testimony That Ammunition Was Found in Defendant’s Safe\n\n¶ 145 Next, we address defendant’s argument that testimony of the presence of ammunition in\n\nhis home safe 50-plus years after the crime was irrelevant and prejudicial. The State apparently\n\nintroduced this evidence to show that the identity of the person who opened the safe was not\n\npublic knowledge, in order to corroborate Swaggerty’s testimony. Defendant does not contest\n\nthe admission of the evidence of who opened the safe, but confines his argument to the\n\nprejudicial impact of the presence of ammunition. We agree with defendant that the evidence of\n\nthe presence of ammunition was irrelevant.      However, we do not agree that the evidence was\n\nprejudicial. There was no showing that defendant’s possession of ammunition was illegal or that\n\na gun played any part in Maria’s abduction and murder.\n\n¶ 146 D. Whether Defendant’s Convictions of Kidnapping and Abduction of an Infant Must Be\n\n                                             Vacated\n\n¶ 147 Defendant’s final contention is that his convictions of kidnapping and abduction of an\n\ninfant must be vacated, as the State failed to prove any exception to those crimes’ three-year\n\nstatutes of limitations in effect in 1957, or, in the alternative, that the conviction of kidnapping\n\nmust be vacated as violating one-act, one-crime principles. The State does not respond on the\n\nmerits but dismisses defendant’s arguments by saying that defendant was not sentenced on the\n\nconvictions of kidnapping and abduction. The record indicates otherwise. In the court’s oral\n\npronouncement, it sentenced defendant to five years’ incarceration for kidnapping and to seven\n\nyears’ incarceration for abduction of an infant. The court then provided that both sentences\n\nwould “merge” into the natural-life sentence for murder. The court’s oral pronouncement was\n\n\n\n                                               - 52 -\n\f2015 IL App (2d) 121364\n\n\nmemorialized in a written order dated and filed on December 10, 2012. Because the State, in\n\nessence, concedes that sentences need not enter on these counts, and because it conceded at oral\n\nargument that it did not adduce any proof that would toll or extend the limitations periods, and\n\nfurther does not contend that defendant forfeited the issue, we vacate defendant’s convictions of\n\nkidnapping and abduction of an infant.\n\n¶ 148                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 149 For the reasons stated, we affirm defendant’s murder conviction and vacate his\n\nconvictions of kidnapping and abduction of an infant.\n\n¶ 150 Affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 53 -\n\f</pre>",
