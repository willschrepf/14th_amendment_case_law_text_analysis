D-1-FM-10-005441, HONORABLE STEPHEN YELENOSKY, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                                           OPINION\n\n\n               This is an appeal from a modification order in a “high-conflict” suit affecting the\n\nparent-child relationship (SAPCR).1 The appellant, Kirk Brand Coburn, challenges the trial court’s\n\nmodification order, which (1) increased his monthly child-support obligation, (2) granted the\n\nappellee, Janet Moreland, the exclusive right to make certain decisions concerning their children’s\n\neducation and health care, (3) restricted his possession of and access to the children while he engaged\n\nin limited court-ordered counseling, and (4) awarded Moreland a substantial portion of her attorney’s\n\nfees and costs. We will vacate the trial court’s order in part, dismiss that part of the cause as moot,\n\nand affirm the remainder of the trial court’s modification order.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          A “high conflict case” is defined as “a suit affecting the parent-child relationship in which\nthe court finds that the parties have demonstrated an unusual degree of: (A) repetitiously resorting\nto the adjudicative process; (B) anger and distrust; and (C) difficulty in communicating about and\ncooperating in the care of their children.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.601(2).\n\f                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n               On February 11, 2011, Coburn and Moreland ended their twelve-year marriage with\n\nan agreed divorce decree. In the decree, Coburn and Moreland were appointed joint managing\n\nconservators of their young daughters, E.C. and P.C. Moreland was awarded the exclusive right to\n\ndesignate the children’s primary residence, and Coburn was awarded standard possession. Although\n\nboth parents were reportedly living in Austin when the decree was executed, the standard possession\n\nterms included modified possessory rights if the parents began living more than 100 miles apart\n\n(long-distance standard possession).\n\n               At the time the agreed divorce decree was executed, Coburn had not been regularly\n\nemployed for several years, and the terms of the decree recognized Coburn’s limited financial\n\nresources by awarding Moreland a larger share of the marital debts and by limiting Coburn’s\n\nchild-support obligation to $600 per month. The decree, however, contemplated that Coburn would\n\nbe seeking employment and specified that the $600 child-support obligation would exist only “[f]or\n\nthe period of time while KIRK BRAND COBURN is unemployed” and would be recalculated “as\n\nsoon as [he] gains employment.”2\n\n               A mere week after the divorce was finalized, there began a series of events and\n\ncircumstances that triggered a cascade of escalating discord between the parties that culminated in\n\nthe underlying modification proceeding and the trial-court order at issue in this appeal. The\n\nprecipitating event occurred when Coburn picked his daughters up for his first post-divorce weekend\n\n\n       2\n          The decree states: “[A]s soon as KIRK BRAND COBURN gains employment, his monthly\nchild support obligation will be recalculated pursuant to the guidelines as set forth in the Texas\nFamily Code. The new amount of child support shall start on the 1st day of the month following his\nstarting date of employment.”\n\n                                                2\n\fvisitation. Coburn arrived at Moreland’s home driving an expensive new vehicle of unknown origin,\n\nwhich caught Moreland’s attention. Coburn then took the children to Houston for the weekend after\n\nrepresenting to Moreland and his daughters that they would be staying in Austin for the visitation\n\nperiod. As Moreland and the girls would soon discover, Coburn had moved to Houston but had\n\nfailed to disclose that fact until he was en route to his new home with the girls.\n\n               When the girls discovered they were leaving Austin, they telephoned their mother.\n\nAccording to Moreland, she and the girls were frightened by the undisclosed diversion and unsettled\n\nby the discovery that Coburn had moved to Houston without their knowledge. Adding to their\n\ndistress, the children learned during the trip to Houston that their father had begun dating his\n\nchildhood sweetheart, Holly.3 When the children returned to Austin, E.C. informed Moreland of that\n\nfact and inquired whether Coburn had been dating his new girlfriend before the divorce. Moreland\n\nresponded that she was not able to answer that question, and she admittedly was upset and angry\n\nabout the situation.\n\n               Moreland was also keenly interested in what appeared to be a sudden improvement\n\nin Coburn’s financial resources. She was particularly upset by the fact that Coburn was driving a\n\nvery expensive new car when a mere week before she had taken responsibility for the majority of\n\nthe marital debt and agreed to accept a $600 monthly child-support payment. Moreland therefore\n\nset out to determine whether Coburn had additional financial resources to contribute to the support\n\nof his children.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Because Coburn and Holly now share the same surname, we refer to her by her first name\nto avoid confusion.\n\n                                                  3\n\f               Although Moreland knew that Holly was extremely wealthy and could have been\n\nsupporting Coburn financially, he had previously informed her that he was interviewing for a job in\n\nHouston. Moreland and her attorney, therefore, repeatedly requested that Coburn disclose the source\n\nof his newfound prosperity. Coburn refused the request, but in an e-mail exchange with Moreland’s\n\nattorney, he denied being employed and closed by saying “[i]t’s nice being kept,” implying that Holly\n\nwas his benefactor.\n\n               Shortly thereafter, Moreland’s attorney noticed Coburn’s deposition in an effort to\n\ndiscover information about his financial resources. At that time, Moreland had purchased airline\n\ntickets to take her daughters to Costa Rica for spring break, because the standard possession terms\n\nof the divorce decree granted her possession of the children at that time. In response to the\n\ndeposition notice, however, Coburn notified Moreland of his intent to exercise his long-distance\n\nstandard-possession rights since he was now residing more than 100 miles from the children; in\n\naccordance with those provisions, Coburn was entitled to possession of the girls during spring break\n\nevery year. When Moreland agreed to cancel Coburn’s deposition, the girls were permitted to go on\n\nthe Costa Rica trip as planned. After returning from the trip, Moreland filed the underlying\n\nmodification petition, seeking recalculation of child support pursuant to the terms of the agreed\n\ndivorce decree.\n\n               In the two months that followed, Coburn and Holly became engaged, and Coburn\n\nsubmitted to a deposition. At his deposition, Coburn testified that he did not have a job, but he was\n\nworking on starting a venture-capital business. As a result, he had not done anything to apply for\n\na job that would pay a salary and presently had no income. He further disclosed that Holly was\n\nsupporting him by paying (1) the debt he had assumed in the agreed divorce decree, (2) all of his\n\n                                                 4\n\fchild-support payments to Moreland, (3) his attorney’s fees for the modification proceeding, and\n\n(4) all of his monthly credit-card expenses. He explained that Holly had also paid the rent for his\n\nfurnished two-bedroom apartment and purchased the expensive new car he had been driving.\n\nCoburn acknowledged that Holly’s financial gifts predated execution of the agreed divorce decree\n\nby approximately two months. He further testified that he did not believe $600 per month in child\n\nsupport was “fair” and stated that he believed that an adequate and fair amount of child support for\n\nhis children was $300 per month.\n\n               Coburn was also questioned about his relationship with his daughters.               He\n\nacknowledged having a poor relationship with them at the time of the deposition, but he blamed\n\nMoreland for alienating them from him. Coburn did not accept responsibility for any of the friction\n\nand asserted that the only thing he had done to contribute to the situation was that he had married\n\nMoreland in the first place.\n\n               Coburn’s relationship with his daughters further soured after he and Holly were\n\nmarried in July 2011. At that time, Coburn and Holly were anxious to blend their two families,\n\nwhich included Holly’s three children from a previous marriage. To that end, Coburn attempted to\n\nexercise his long-distance standard-possession rights in Houston, but the girls, who where\n\nincreasingly exhibiting signs of emotional distress and anxiety, resisted visitation by crying, getting\n\nphysically ill, refusing to get out of the car, and running away and hiding. The issues the children\n\nwere experiencing included distress over being so quickly integrated into a new family situation and\n\ndiscomfort at missing events and activities in Austin that were important to them during their\n\nfather’s periods of visitation. The relationship between Coburn and Moreland had also become\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fhighly conflicted, and the parties dispute whether and to what extent the conflict resulted from or\n\ncaused the situation between Coburn and their daughters.\n\n                Due to frequent disagreements about the nature, extent, and location of Coburn’s\n\nvisitation with the girls, a number of efforts ensued to ameliorate the discord and address the\n\ntransition issues the children were experiencing. Temporary orders were issued concerning Coburn’s\n\nsummer visitation, and a parenting facilitator was appointed to assist in visitation transitions, dispute\n\nresolution, and communications between Moreland and Coburn.\n\n                The parties also engaged the assistance of therapeutic professionals to address the\n\nissues of familial conflict. Dr. Allison Wilcox became the girls’ individual therapist. Family\n\ncounseling was also secured, first from Dr. Susan McMillan and then from Dr. Carlos Loredo.4 In\n\naddition to engaging the services of these therapists, Moreland started attending a divorce support\n\ngroup and participating in individual therapy. Coburn did not retain an individual therapist but did\n\nbegin attending family therapy sessions.\n\n                In therapy, the family worked to address a number of consistent behavior patterns that\n\nwere identified as having aggravated tensions, including that (1) Coburn minimized or failed to\n\nappreciate how his daughters were impacted by the significant and sudden changes in their lives,\n\ncreating the impression that he was disinterested in their feelings; (2) Coburn disregarded or\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          In an agreed order, the trial court appointed Dr. Loredo to (1) provide family therapy for\nthe parents and the children, (2) make recommendations to the parents as to the parents’ interactions\nwith the children, (3) assist the children and their parents in reducing conflict and in facilitating the\nrelationship and visitation between Coburn and the children, and (4) make recommendations\nconcerning visitation, access, and communication between Coburn and the children.\n\n                                                   6\n\funderestimated the girls’ need to spend “alone time” with him during visitation;5 (3) Coburn resisted\n\nthe therapists’ recommendations to gradually transition the children into their new, blended family;6\n\n(4) the children perceived Coburn as being insensitive to their desire to participate in activities and\n\nevents they had been participating in for several years before their parents divorced, including events\n\nthat were important to them that they would miss if visitation occurred every other weekend in\n\nHouston;7 (5) Moreland had emotional and angry outbursts towards Coburn and Holly in front of the\n\n\n        5\n         The girls told their therapist, Dr. Wilcox, that they “wanted to spend time alone with their\nfather” but that “when they went to Houston with their dad they very rarely spent much time alone\nwith him.”\n        6\n           Dr. Wilcox and the family therapist, Dr. Loredo, both testified they informed Coburn that\nit would be therapeutically beneficial for him to spend alone time with the girls and gradually\ntransition them into a blended family. Coburn and Holly, however, did not agree with the therapists’\nrecommendations and instead believed that the best course of action was to force the girls to go on\nvisits with their father and spend time as a blended family. Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo testified that\nCoburn resisted their recommendations to employ a “step-wise” progression that included time spent\nalone with the girls. They gave as an example a circumstance in October 2011 when Coburn made\nplans to spend the weekend with his daughters at a hotel in Austin. Coburn admitted to knowing that\nthe girls believed that they would be spending time alone with their father. Coburn, however, said\nhe never actually “agreed” to spend the weekend alone with the girls so he did not turn Holly and\nher children away when they “surprised” him and the girls by showing up at the hotel. Dr. Wilcox\nreported to the court that, after the incident, the girls were “visibly distraught and upset at what they\nperceive[d] to be their father’s deliberate deception.” At the time of trial, Coburn and Holly\ncontinued to maintain that the therapists’ recommendations were wrong.\n        7\n           The girls’ activities included swim team, dance, and gymnastics. Issues arose when the\ngirls would have a competition or recital that conflicted with Coburn’s visitation periods. Although\nCoburn complained that Moreland signed the children up for these activities without his consent, the\nrecord shows that the girls had been engaged in these activities for years, and although the dates of\nevents changed from year to year, those events were scheduled by third parties, not Moreland.\nCoburn testified that he tried to be flexible with visitation times to accommodate some of the\nactivities, and the record reflects that the girls were ultimately able to attend most of their activities\nas a result. The primary source of tension appears to have been Coburn’s inability or unwillingness\nto decide in advance whether the girls would be able to attend scheduled events and activities. This\nresulted in the girls’ feeling anxious and emotional about whether they would actually be able to\nattend. Coburn asserted that he did not have enough notice of the girls’ events to make informed\ndecisions about how the rest of the family would be burdened by accommodating an individual’s\n\n                                                    7\n\fchildren on occasion, and the children felt very protective of her;8 (6) Coburn had said insensitive\n\nand hurtful things about Moreland to the children on occasion;9 (7) Coburn had not followed through\n\nwith promises to the girls or denied having made promises to them, which caused them to distrust\n\nhim;10 and (8) Coburn felt that Moreland encouraged the children to be disrespectful to him and to\n\n\nactivities. Moreland stated that event schedules for at least some activities were available on\ncalendars accessible to Coburn via the Internet.\n       8\n          Moreland admits to having become overly emotional and angry in front of the children on\nseveral occasions before she started participating in individual therapy and her divorce support\ngroup. Among other things, she admitted to (1) crying and telling the girls that their father was\nleaving all of them when he asked her for a divorce, which allegedly prompted E.C. to yell “Daddy,\nI hate you, I hate you”; (2) putting the L sign to her forehead with her fingers to insinuate that\nCoburn was a “loser” during a temporary-orders hearing; (3) throwing bills into Coburn’s car, telling\nHolly “here, pay these bills, these are for you,” saying “F-U, Kirk. Go to hell,” and referring to\nCoburn and Holly as “losers” at one visitation exchange during which both parties called the police;\n(4) telling Coburn that he had “some balls” for showing up at the girls’ swim competition and\nreferring to him as “Mr. Toussaint” (Holly’s former surname); (5) stating that Holly did not love E.C.\nand barely knew her when Holly professed to love E.C. at a gymnastics event; and (6) not telling\nCoburn or school officials that the girls planned to hide from him when he was coming to pick them\nup at school for visitation, which created a serious issue at the school. Moreland also admitted to\nmaking a number of derogatory comments to Coburn and Holly that were not in the children’s\npresence, but which caused Coburn to believe that similar statements were being made about them\nto the children. Further, although neither admitted nor denied by Moreland, Coburn and Holly\nreported that Moreland (1) had to be physically restrained in front of the children on two occasions,\n(2) had referred to Holly as being “as psychotic as [Coburn]” in front of E.C., (3) had referred to\nthem as “a joke” during the incident at school, (4) had “body checked” Holly at a gymnastics event,\nand (5) had hit Coburn on “quite a few occasions.” It appears to be undisputed, however, that neither\nthese nor similar incidents had occurred in the six months preceding the modification trial. It is\nlikewise undisputed that Coburn never responded in kind.\n       9\n          Coburn admitted that he told the children that Holly was his soul-mate, it was a mistake\nto have married Moreland, God approved of the divorce because he and Moreland did not have a\ncovenant before God, and God approved of his marriage to Holly because they do have a covenant.\nCoburn testified that, to some extent, it was important for the children to know this information and\nthat it would help foster a better relationship between him and his children.\n       10\n           In addition to the incident at the hotel, another example of Coburn’s allegedly reneging\non a deal the girls believed he had made occurred in November 2011. During a meeting, Dr. Wilcox\nand the girls understood that Coburn was offering to trade weekends so that the girls could spend\n\n                                                  8\n\fresist their visitations with him.11 Moreland admittedly did not respond well when she was upset,\n\nespecially in situations she believed were causing her children distress, but she sought therapy to\n\naddress that behavior and took responsibility for her actions.\n\n                Although Coburn denied contributing to his children’s distress, he nevertheless agreed\n\nto a court order that required the parties “to cooperate with Dr. Loredo and to follow Dr. Loredo’s\n\nrecommendations concerning the children, as to visitation, access, content, and the behavior of the\n\nparent toward the child.” As a result of this agreement, Coburn had limited visitation with the girls\n\nfor about six months before trial and mostly interacted with the girls in thrice-weekly Skype sessions\n\nand periodic therapy sessions. During this time period, Coburn also voluntarily agreed to increase\n\n\nThanksgiving with family members in Austin. Dr. Wilcox said the girls were excited about the\nopportunity when they left the session. The following day, however, Dr. Wilcox said Coburn\nexchanged a series of emails with her in which he “completely disavowed everything that happened\nin the session the previous day,” including his agreement to trade weekends. According to\nDr. Wilcox, Coburn “consistently placed the girls in a position in which they begin to second-guess\ntheir own thoughts. When they are unable to rationalize what their father has done[,] they begin to\nbecome angry and disillusioned with [him].”\n       11\n           Coburn complained that Moreland did not consistently reprimand the children for speaking\ndisrespectfully or inappropriately to or about him, but it was disputed whether and to what extent the\nchildren were being “disrespectful” versus appropriately expressing their feelings. The therapists\nwho testified at trial said that the children needed to be able to express their feelings to their father\nand that it was debatable as to where some of the interactions fell on the spectrum between\ncommunication of feelings and disrespect. Coburn further testified that, on occasion, the children\ncriticized him using language he believes they had heard from their mother.\n         Coburn asserted that Moreland had interfered with his relationship with the girls from the\noutset of their separation. He testified that he was asked not to take possession of the girls for a\nwhile because Moreland and his daughters were having difficulty with the divorce. Then, when he\ndid begin taking possession, he said that Moreland complained that the girls were scared to visit him\nat his new home in Austin and that she consistently interrupted his periods of possession because she\nwould pick up the girls on their request. There is also evidence that Moreland suggested to the girls\nthat they would not have to go on visits with their father if they were unwilling or if he was more\nthan 15 minutes late to pick them up. The parties further dispute the extent of Moreland’s role in the\nchildren’s plan to hide at school to avoid a scheduled visitation with their father. Finally, Moreland\nadmitted to having expressed to Coburn that she wanted him out of the girls’ lives permanently.\n\n                                                   9\n\fhis child-support payment to the statutory guideline maximum of $1,875 per month while the\n\nmodification suit was pending. See Tex. Fam. Code § 154.125 (guidelines for determining\n\npresumptive child-support obligation).\n\n               Moreland and Coburn also agreed to submit to psychological evaluations, and the trial\n\ncourt appointed Dr. Alissa Sherry to perform those evaluations.12 After completing the evaluations,\n\nDr. Sherry diagnosed Coburn with “narcissistic personality disorder” with “sociopathic traits.”\n\nDr. Sherry found that Coburn “places his own needs over the needs of the children” and is “willing\n\nto forgo the girls’ events in favor of his own needs and has [also] exercised serious lapses in\n\njudgment in his communication[s] with other mental health professionals trying to assist the family.”\n\nDr. Sherry concluded that Coburn “is not likely to take responsibility for his actions and instead\n\ntends to blame and project his shortcomings on to [sic] others.” As a result, she determined that “the\n\nlikelihood of [Coburn’s] ability to engage in effective co-parenting is seriously limited as is his\n\nability to place the needs of others ahead of himself.” She further found that Coburn had engaged\n\nin “gaslighting behavior,” which she defined as “manipulative behavior used to confuse people into\n\nquestioning their reactions to events, so much so that the victims of gaslighting begin to question\n\ntheir own sanity.” She observed that gaslighting is often referred to as “‘crazy-making’ as it makes\n\notherwise ordinary functioning individuals act ‘crazy’ in the face of such discrepant pieces\n\nof information.”\n\n               In comparison, Dr. Sherry determined that Moreland did not meet the criteria for any\n\npersonality disorder. She also concluded that Moreland’s actions did not meet the threshold for\n\n\n       12\n          As with the other therapeutic professionals, Dr. Sherry was recommended by either\nCoburn or his attorneys.\n\n                                                 10\n\fparental alienating behaviors. She further opined that “when [Moreland’s] behavior has become\n\nunrestrained, it is the result of behaviors that are insensitive, narcissistic, or baiting on the part of Mr.\n\nCoburn.” Also, in contrast to Coburn, Dr. Sherry found that Moreland was “interpersonally inclined\n\ntowards cooperative, mutually satisfying relationships.” Dr. Sherry concluded that Moreland’s\n\n“healthy reality testing, likelihood of engaging in cooperative relationships, and affective stability\n\nbode well for both healthy parenting and the ability to co-parent with others. However, because of\n\nMr. Coburn’s existing psychopathology, the likelihood of this parent dyad to co-parent with each\n\nother is tentative at best.”\n\n                In April 2012, about two months before trial, Moreland expanded her modification\n\npetition to include a request to be granted exclusive rights and duties with respect to several aspects\n\nof the children’s lives. Moreland also sought significant modifications to Coburn’s possessory rights\n\nand requested that the trial court order Coburn to (1) exercise all of his periods of possession in\n\nTravis County; (2) take the children to all of their extracurricular activities and events during his\n\nperiods of possession; (3) engage in individual counseling in order to have possession of and access\n\nto the children; (4) submit to supervised visitation, as recommended by the children’s therapists;\n\n(5) pay for the children’s therapy; and (6) Skype with the children only if recommended by the\n\nchildren’s therapists.\n\n                In response, Coburn filed a counter-petition requesting appointment as the children’s\n\nsole managing conservator or, in the alternative, joint managing conservator with the exclusive right\n\nto make certain decisions regarding the children, including the right to designate their primary\n\nresidence. According to Coburn and Holly, Moreland’s interference was the driving factor in the\n\n\n\n                                                     11\n\fproblems the girls were experiencing with their father. As a result, Coburn sought sole custody as\n\na means of forming a positive relationship with his children and successfully blending his families.\n\nAt that time, however, Coburn had not had weekend possession of the girls in several months\n\nbecause he had not complied with Dr. Loredo’s therapeutic recommendations and because his\n\nestrangement from his daughters was intensifying.13 Dr. Sherry observed that Coburn’s request for\n\nimmediate sole custody, given the status of his relationship with the children—and contrary to the\n\ntherapists’ recommendations—was consistent with a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder,\n\nbut she acknowledged that it could also have reflected the advice of legal counsel.\n\n               At trial, Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo testified that even with professional intervention\n\nand regular Skype communications, the girls’ emotional state and estrangement from their father had\n\ngotten worse. According to the therapists, significant reasons for the lack of improvement included\n\n(1) Coburn’s unwillingness to follow their therapeutic recommendations, including spending alone\n\ntime with the girls and employing a “step-wise” progression of visitation with the blended family\n\nin Houston; (2) his professed inability to regularly attend therapy sessions with Dr. Loredo due to\n\nhis work schedule during the week; and (3) his disturbing interactions with the children in recorded\n\nSkype sessions, in which he appeared indifferent and unsympathetic to their emotional distress and\n\nflaunted the lavish lifestyle he was living. Both Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo also testified that they\n\nhad observed interpersonal conduct by Coburn that was consistent with Dr. Sherry’s diagnosis of\n\n\n       13\n           The court order appointing Dr. Loredo provided a method of recourse if a party objected\nto the doctor’s recommendations or did not wish to follow those recommendations. Under the\ncourt’s order, an objecting party was required to give written notice to Dr. Loredo and the other\nparties of “the intention not to abide by Dr. Loredo’s recommendations” and had the duty to bring\nthe matter to the trial court’s attention. There is no indication in the record that Coburn followed\nthis procedure.\n\n                                                12\n\fnarcissistic personality disorder with sociopathic traits. Dr. Loredo further declared that there were\n\nvideo recordings of instances in which Coburn had engaged in “gaslighting behavior” with the\n\nchildren, which he characterized as “a type of psychological abuse.” Dr. Wilcox opined that both\n\ngirls were suffering from “systemic emotional abuse” and that Coburn was the parent primarily\n\nresponsible for the emotional abuse they had endured. She observed that, although the girls were\n\nangry at both their mother and father, they had enjoyed alone time with their mother to work through\n\ntheir feelings, but their father would not spend alone time with them, even at the therapists’ behest.\n\n                Dr. Wilcox also agreed with Dr. Sherry’s conclusion that Moreland had not alienated\n\nthe girls from their father and, instead, had helped facilitate the girls’ spending time with him.\n\nDr. Loredo further testified that Moreland had been helpful in getting the girls to participate in\n\ntherapy sessions with their father when they were resisting. Both therapists acknowledged, however,\n\nthat Moreland had behaved inappropriately in front of the children in ways that were neither proper\n\nnor helpful, and Dr. Wilcox testified that Moreland’s “screaming at [Coburn] in front of the school\n\n[during one visitation exchange] is probably emotionally abusive.” They noted, however, that\n\nMoreland had accepted responsibility for her behavior, undertaken measures to rectify it, and had\n\nnot—to their knowledge—engaged in similar conduct in the six-month period preceding trial.\n\n                Both Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo opined that it would be inadvisable to force the girls\n\nto go on visits with their father given the state of their relationship at that time. They explained that\n\nforced visitation would probably make the situation worse and would be detrimental to the girls.\n\nBoth therapists also recommended to the court that the children not be required to visit with their\n\nfather unless a third party, preferably a therapist, was present as they employed a step-wise transition\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n\finto long-distance standard possession with Coburn and the blended family. Dr. Loredo also testified\n\nthat Coburn needed individual counseling with a therapist who would communicate with the other\n\ntherapists and not just rely on Coburn’s version of events. According to Dr. Loredo, a family\n\ndynamic that includes a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder is among the most difficult to\n\nwork with and has the potential to be very destructive in a family system. He stated, however, that\n\nhe believed therapy would be beneficial because Coburn and the children truly love each other and\n\nwant a healthy relationship.\n\n               Dr. Sherry concurred that therapeutic intervention was necessary to address Coburn’s\n\nmanipulative behavior, which she testified is destructive to a relationship between parent and child.\n\nShe asserted that it was important for Coburn to understand that he needs to make changes. As a\n\nresult, she observed that he would need to work with a therapist who would challenge his perspective\n\nand not simply mirror his world view. Dr. Sherry further testified that it would be detrimental to\n\nforce the girls to “hurry up” into a blended family until some time had been spent “acknowledging\n\nand repairing the damage that’s been done and easing the kids into a relationship with that\n\nacknowledgment . . . .” With respect to the children’s activities, she stated that there needed to be\n\nmore proactive management of the children’s expectations regarding attendance. Specifically, she\n\nsaid, in order to reduce the children’s anxiety, there needed to be a plan for the children to\n\nunderstand in advance what they can attend, who will be attending with them, and what they will\n\nhave to miss. She opined that an authoritative approach that did not take into consideration the\n\nchildren’s desires and feelings would be ineffective and would enhance conflict with the children,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fwho are at or approaching a developmental stage where their individual identities are becoming\n\nimportant to them.\n\n               With regard to shared parenting rights, Dr. Sherry testified that it was possible for\n\nCoburn to effectively co-parent if circumstances were structured in a way that benefitted him, but\n\nshe stated that “he’s going to have some problems anytime he gets a response from others, whether\n\nit’s the girls or Ms. Moreland, that he doesn’t want or that doesn’t fit his view of himself. But the\n\nmore it can be structured in a way . . . that he has something to gain by it, probably the better.” She\n\nfurther recommended that Moreland and Coburn have no contact with each other and that one parent\n\nbe granted the exclusive right to make decisions regarding the children to minimize their\n\ninteractions. She observed that Moreland is the “predominant parent” and that there are a number\n\nof psychological issues with Coburn that interfere with his ability to respond appropriately to the\n\nchildren’s emotional needs.\n\n               At the time of trial, Coburn testified that he had met with an individual therapist for\n\none hour on one occasion, but little was known about the therapist’s qualifications. Although\n\nCoburn was not committed to the idea that he needed to participate in therapy, he professed a\n\nwillingness to do so. Ultimately, both Coburn and Holly testified that they did not agree with\n\nDr. Sherry’s diagnosis and did not agree with salient aspects of Dr. Wilcox’s and Dr. Loredo’s\n\ntherapeutic recommendations. Coburn testified that it would be in the girls’ best interests if he were\n\nawarded primary possession, or in the alternative, standard possession that was not conditioned on\n\ntherapeutic participation or the recommendation of any therapists as to the frequency and duration\n\nof appropriate visitation. Although Coburn conceded that his decisions to divorce Moreland, move\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fto Houston, and introduce a new family into the girls’ lives had been difficult for them, he\n\nmaintained that Moreland was primarily responsible for the problems between him and the girls and\n\nhad exacerbated the situation. Meanwhile, Holly testified that Moreland was “95 percent” of the\n\ncause of the estrangement between Coburn and his daughters and was the sole impediment to\n\nimproving the situation. She asserted that the solution to the problem was for Coburn to be more\n\nauthoritative in enforcing visitation with the girls. Dr. Loredo testified that Holly’s opinion reflected\n\na “simplistic solution” to a complicated situation and showed a “lack of insight.”\n\n                With regard to the child-support issue, Coburn testified that he was presently\n\nself-employed as a venture capitalist. He admitted that he considered himself to have a job, but did\n\nnot currently make any money due to the compensation structure of his business, which he said is\n\nstandard in the industry. He agreed that “the decision not to take a [paying] job is a voluntary one”\n\non his part and stated that his wife’s financial support is helping him do so. He testified that he is\n\n“voluntarily . . . not seeking or accepting employment” and would not do so for the foreseeable\n\nfuture because “it’s not about the money.” He testified that, if he obtained gainful employment, he\n\ncould reasonably expect to earn between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Although Moreland’s\n\ncounsel sought to introduce evidence about Holly’s financial resources, the trial court concluded that\n\nthe proffered evidence was irrelevant to the child-support issue before the court. See Tex. Fam.\n\nCode § 156.404 (“The court may not add any portion of the net resources of a new spouse to the net\n\nresources of an obligor or obligee in order to calculate the amount of child support to be ordered in\n\na suit for modification.”); see also id. § 154.069 (“The court may not add any portion of the net\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fresources of a spouse to the net resources of an obligor or obligee in order to calculate the amount\n\nof child support ordered.”).\n\n               After hearing the foregoing evidence, the trial court observed that all three expert\n\nwitnesses recommended something other than granting Coburn primary possession or immediate\n\nstandard possession. Accordingly, the court entered an order denying Coburn’s modification request\n\nin its entirety and directing Coburn to participate in 25 weeks of individual therapy with his chosen\n\ntherapist and 25 weeks of family therapy with Dr. Loredo before resuming standard possession. The\n\ntrial court also required Coburn to execute a release allowing the therapists to share information with\n\none another and with Dr. Wilcox. During the 25-week period, Coburn was entitled to supervised\n\nvisitation with the girls for 1.5 hours each week and could Skype with the girls in a frequency and\n\nmanner directed by Dr. Loredo. The trial court further denied Coburn extended possession of the\n\ngirls for 42 consecutive days in the summer of 2012, as he had requested under his standard\n\npossession rights. The trial court’s order further awarded Coburn standard possession upon\n\ncompletion of the required counseling. Moreland, however, was awarded the exclusive right to make\n\ndecisions concerning the children’s education and to consent to non-invasive medical and dental\n\nprocedures and psychiatric and psychological treatment of the children.\n\n               With respect to child support, the court found that Coburn had admitted to intentional\n\nunderemployment and his ability to make a six-figure income. The court determined that Coburn\n\nhas the ability to make $200,000 per year and that his monthly net resources are $12,736.11. The\n\ncourt also found the children’s proven support needs to be $3,557.50 per month.14 Based on these\n\n\n       14\n          At trial, Moreland introduced evidence concerning the actual expenses incurred to support\nthe children. The court determined that some of the expenses could be segregated between Moreland\n\n                                                  17\n\fdeterminations, the court concluded that the statutory guideline child-support payment was $1,875\n\nand that Coburn was responsible for paying 50% of the children’s proven needs above the guideline\n\namount, resulting in a child-support obligation of $2,716.25. See id. §§ 154.125 (presumptive\n\npercentage guidelines applicable to obligor’s net resources), .126 (court order for additional\n\nchild-support amounts based on parents’ income and child’s proven needs); see also id. § 156.402\n\n(effect of child-support guidelines in modification proceeding). The court also awarded Moreland\n\n$165,366.65 in attorney’s fees, which is approximately 80% of the attorney’s fees Coburn stipulated\n\nto be reasonable and necessary. See id. § 106.002(a) (vesting trial court with discretion to award\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees in SAPCR proceeding). In addition to the final order modifying the\n\nagreed divorce decree, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n               In four issues on appeal, Coburn asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n(1) deviating from the standard possession order and conditioning possession and access on\n\nhis participation in 25 weeks of court-ordered counseling, (2) granting Moreland exclusive\n\ndecision-making rights concerning the children’s education and health care, (3) determining that a\n\nchange in circumstances warranted modification and increasing his child-support obligation based\n\n\n\n\nand the children, while other expenses were not readily divisible between them. As for the\nnon-divisible expenses—mortgage, household, groceries, meals away from home, transportation, and\nincidentals—the court attributed one-third of some expenses and one-half of other expenses to the\nchildren. Expenses attributable solely to the children—including school lunches and life\ninsurance—were fully credited to the children’s support needs. The court disregarded expenses that\ncould have been segregated but were not, including medical and mental-health care, clothing,\nand shoes.\n\n                                                18\n\fon a finding that he was voluntarily underemployed, and (4) requiring him to pay any of Moreland’s\n\nattorney’s fees and court costs related to the modification proceeding.15\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n                The issues presented in this appeal are subject to review for clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See, e.g., Worford v. Stamper, 801 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. 1990); Zeifman v. Michels,\n\n212 S.W.3d 582, 587 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. denied); In re J.R.D., 169 S.W.3d 740, 743\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2005, pet. denied); Echols v. Olivarez, 85 S.W.3d 475, 476 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2002, no pet.); Satterfield v. Huff, 768 S.W.2d 839, 841 (Tex. App.—Austin 1989, writ denied). “A\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion only when it has acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner, or\n\nwhen it acts without reference to any guiding principle.” In re Marriage of Jeffries, 144 S.W.3d 636,\n\n638 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2004, no pet.) (citing Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc.,\n\n701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985)). Under this standard, legal and factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence are not independent grounds for asserting error but are relevant factors in determining\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion. Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 587; Niskar v. Niskar,\n\n136 S.W.3d 749, 753 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.); In re Davis, 30 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2000, no pet.). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, we\n\nconsider whether the trial court had sufficient evidence upon which to exercise its discretion and,\n\nif so, whether it erred in the exercise of that discretion. In re W.C.B., 337 S.W.3d 510, 513 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2011, no pet.). We consider only the evidence most favorable to the trial court’s\n\nruling and will uphold its judgment on any legal theory supported by the evidence. Worford,\n\n\n       15\n            Coburn does not challenge the trial court’s denial of his modification counter-petition.\n\n                                                  19\n\f801 S.W.2d at 109. A trial court does not abuse its discretion if there is some evidence\n\nof a substantive and probative character to support the court’s decision. Valdez v. Valdez,\n\n930 S.W.2d 725, 731 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).\n\n                We are further mindful that “the trial judge is best able to observe and assess the\n\nwitnesses’ demeanor and credibility, and to sense the ‘forces, powers, and influences’ that may not\n\nbe apparent from merely reading the record on appeal.” In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d 424, 427 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.). We, therefore, defer to the trial court’s judgment in\n\nmatters involving factual resolutions and any credibility determinations that may have affected those\n\nresolutions.16 George v. Jeppeson, 238 S.W.3d 463, 468 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007,\n\nno pet.).\n\n\n        Possession and Access\n\n                In his first appellate issue, Coburn challenges the portion of the modification order\n\ndenying him standard possession and restricting his access to the children contingent on his\n\nparticipation in 25 weeks of individual and family psychological counseling. Coburn asserts that the\n\n\n        16\n            Although Coburn’s briefing focuses on who is to “blame” in this case and which of the\nparents is being “punished” and “rewarded” for creating or contributing to the underlying family\nconflict, the trial court’s paramount concern is what is in the children’s best interests based on the\nevidence before the court. See Tex. Fam. Code §§ 153.002 (“The best interest of the child shall\nalways be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and\npossession of and access to the child.” (emphasis added)); 156.101 (modification of possession and\naccess must be in child’s best interest), .402 (modification of existing child-support order must be\nin child’s best interest); see also Gillespie v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449, 451 (Tex. 1982) (observing\nthat trial court has “wide latitude” in determining child’s best interest). As illustrated by the biblical\nstory of wise King Solomon, the desires and best interests of a parent should yield to the welfare and\nbest interests of a child when those interests are in conflict. Cf. Dupree v. Texas Dep’t of Protective\n& Regulatory Servs., 907 S.W.2d 81, 86 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, no writ) (in cases involving\ntermination of parental rights, concern is for child’s best interest, not parent’s best interest).\n\n                                                   20\n\frestriction of his possession and access conflicts both with the rebuttable presumption that standard\n\npossession is the “minimum reasonable possession” to which he is entitled and with the trial court’s\n\nfinding that it is in the children’s best interests that Coburn remain a joint managing conservator.\n\nSee Tex. Fam. Code §§ 153.131(b) (rebuttable presumption that appointment of parents as joint\n\nmanaging conservator is in child’s best interest), .134 (factors to be considered in determining\n\nwhether joint managing conservator arrangement is in child’s best interest), .252 (rebuttable\n\npresumption that statutory standard possession order provides “reasonable minimum possession” for\n\npossessory or joint managing conservator and is in child’s best interest), .256 (factors court may\n\nconsider in ordering less than standard possession); see also Blackwell v. Humble, 241 S.W.3d 707,\n\n720-21 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007, no pet.) (concluding that indefinite denial of possession and\n\nsevere restriction of visitation conflicted with trial court’s implied finding that mother’s continued\n\nappointment as joint managing conservator was in children’s best interests). Coburn also argues that\n\ntrial courts have no statutory authority to order less than standard possession when the parents are\n\nnamed joint managing conservators. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.256 (providing factors court may\n\nconsider in awarding other than standard possession, including “the circumstances of the managing\n\nconservator and of the parent named as a possessory conservator”). But see id. § 153.252 (stating\n\nthat rebuttable presumption regarding standard possession applies to “parent named as a possessory\n\nconservator or joint managing conservator”). To the extent the trial court has discretion to grant less\n\nthan standard possession, Coburn asserts that the restrictions the trial court imposed are not\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence because the record reflects that both he and Moreland contributed\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fto the systemic emotional problems with their daughters and therefore the trial court’s order\n\n“punishes” only him.\n\n               After this appeal was perfected, we were informed that Coburn completed the\n\nrequired therapy sessions and resumed long-distance standard possession of E.C. and P.C. As\n\na result, Moreland asserts that Coburn’s first appellate issue is moot. See Williams v. Lara,\n\n52 S.W.3d 171, 184 (Tex. 2001) (“[A] controversy must exist between the parties at every stage of\n\nthe legal proceedings, including the appeal.”). In the alternative, Moreland contends the trial court\n\nhad both the statutory authority and sufficient evidence to limit Coburn’s possession and access\n\ncontingent on his participation in individual and family counseling.            See In re L.M.M.,\n\nNo. 03-04-00452-CV, 2005 WL 2094758, at *9 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 31, 2005, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (observing that “[t]rial courts are not obligated to order standard possession; if a court\n\ndetermines that the standard possession order is not in the child’s best interest, then the court can\n\neither deny possession and access altogether or ‘fashion an order that restricts possession or access\n\nso as to eliminate any danger to the physical or emotional welfare of the child’” (quoting In re\n\nWalters, 39 S.W.3d 280, 286 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2001, no pet.))); see also In re J.S.P.,\n\n278 S.W.3d 414, 422 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2008, no pet.) (no per se prohibition on allowing\n\nneutral third party, such as mental-health professional, to incrementally expand possession rights of\n\nparent with limited cognitive abilities).\n\n               Under our constitution, courts have no jurisdiction to render advisory opinions. See\n\nTex. Const. art. II, § 1. As a result, a court cannot decide a case that has become moot during the\n\npendency of an appeal. Heckman v. Williamson Cnty., 369 S.W.3d 137, 162 (Tex. 2012).\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f        A case becomes moot if, since the time of filing, there has ceased to exist a\n        justiciable controversy between the parties—that is, if the issues presented are no\n        longer ‘live,’ or if the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. Put\n        simply, a case is moot when the court’s action on the merits cannot affect the parties’\n        rights or interests. If a case is or becomes moot, the court must vacate any order or\n        judgment previously issued and dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\nId. (internal citations omitted).\n\n                Although a decision on the possession and access issue on appeal would no longer\n\naffect the parties’ rights or interests as to that matter, Coburn contends the issue is not moot under\n\nthe “capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review” exception to the mootness doctrine. See General\n\nLand Office of State of Tex. v. OXY U.S.A., Inc., 789 S.W.2d 569, 571 (Tex. 1990). The Texas\n\nSupreme Court has explained that this exception\n\n\n        applies only in rare circumstances. To invoke the exception, a complaining party\n        must prove that: (1) the challenged action was too short in duration to be litigated\n        fully before the action ceased or expired; and (2) a reasonable expectation exists that\n        the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.\n\n\nWilliams, 52 S.W.3d at 184 (citations omitted).\n\n                With respect to the “evading-review” element, the proper inquiry is whether the\n\nchallenged activity is by its very nature short in duration so that it could not, or probably would not,\n\nbe able to be adjudicated before becoming moot. See id. The plaintiff must show that the time\n\nbetween the challenged action and its expiration is always so short as to evade review. See Spencer\n\nv. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998) (petitioner could not show that time between parole revocation and\n\nexpiration of sentence is always so short as to evade review).                When determining the\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f“capable-of-repetition” element, there must be a “reasonable expectation” or a “demonstrated\n\nprobability” that the same controversy will recur involving the same complaining party. See Murphy\n\nv. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 482 (1982); Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975); City of Dallas\n\nv. Woodfield, 305 S.W.3d 412, 419 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.); Dear v. City of Irving,\n\n902 S.W.2d 731, 736 (Tex. App.—Austin 1995, writ denied).\n\n                We conclude that Coburn has not satisfied the requirements for the\n\n“capable-of-recognition-yet-evading-review” exception.17 Even assuming the issue on appeal “is\n\nalways so short as to evade review,” Coburn has not addressed the second prong of the exception at\n\nall, and it is not apparent that there is a “reasonable expectation” that he will be subjected to the same\n\naction again. “The mere physical or theoretical possibility that the same party may be subjected to\n\nthe same action again is not sufficient to satisfy the test.” Woodfield, 305 S.W.3d at 419 (citing\n\nMurphy, 455 U.S. at 482). The therapists who testified at trial were generally in agreement that it\n\nwas possible for therapy and a step-wise integration of the children into their new blended family\n\nto help remediate the alienation between Coburn and his children and help the children heal\n\nemotionally. If these measures were beneficial in rectifying the problems between Coburn and his\n\ndaughters, it would not be reasonable to expect the trial court to have an occasion to impose similar\n\nrestrictions in the future. Correspondingly, if therapy was not effective, it would not be reasonable\n\nto expect the trial court to continue to pursue a course of action that had proven fruitless. Although\n\nit is certainly possible that the same or similar restrictions could be imposed in the future, there is\n\n\n        17\n           In light of this determination, we need not consider Moreland’s alternative argument that\nthe “capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review” exception does not apply in this case because it only\napplies to unconstitutional acts performed by the government. See General Land Office of State of\nTex. v. OXY U.S.A., Inc., 789 S.W.2d 569, 571 (Tex. 1990).\n\n                                                   24\n\fno demonstrated probability of that occurrence. Accordingly, we conclude that Coburn’s first\n\nappellate issue is moot, and we therefore vacate the portion of the trial court’s judgment placing\n\nrestrictions and conditions on Coburn’s rights of possession and access. See Thompson v. Ricardo,\n\n269 S.W.3d 100, 103-04 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (when case becomes moot\n\nduring appeal, appellate court should vacate trial court’s judgment).\n\n\n        Rights and Duties of the Parents\n\n                The second complaint Coburn advances is that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nawarding Moreland the exclusive right to make decisions regarding E.C.’s and P.C.’s education and\n\nto consent to non-invasive medical and dental procedures on their behalf.18 Coburn contends there\n\nis no evidence that he should be denied participation in such significant matters of decision regarding\n\nthe children. He further contends there is no evidence that he and Moreland were in actual conflict\n\nregarding the children’s education and non-invasive health-care decisions or that he was apathetic\n\nabout or neglectful of these matters. Accordingly, he contends there is no evidence to support the\n\ntrial court’s determination that limiting his parental rights is in the children’s best interests.\n\n                When parents are named joint managing conservators, the trial court must allocate\n\nparental rights and duties to be exercised independently, jointly, or exclusively. Tex. Fam. Code\n\n§ 153.071 (court required to specify rights and duties of parent appointed conservator); .072 (court\n\nmay limit rights and duties if written finding that limitation is in child’s best interest), .134(b)(2),\n\n(4) (rights and duties in court-ordered joint conservatorship); see also id. § 151.001 (parental rights\n\n\n        18\n           The trial court also awarded Moreland the exclusive right to consent to psychiatric and\npsychological treatment of the children, but Coburn does not appear to challenge this portion of the\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n                                                   25\n\fand duties). Parents can be appointed joint managing conservators even if the exclusive right to\n\nmake certain decisions is awarded to only one parent. See id. § 101.016 (defining “joint managing\n\nconservatorship” to mean “the sharing of the rights and duties of a parent by two parties, ordinarily\n\nthe parents, even if the exclusive right to make certain decisions may be awarded to one party”).\n\n               In the agreed divorce decree between Coburn and Moreland, the parties were granted\n\nthe joint right to make educational decisions and to consent to non-invasive medical and dental\n\nprocedures on behalf of their daughters. The Family Code provides that the court may modify a prior\n\norder (1) if doing so would be in the child’s best interest and (2) if the child’s or parties’\n\ncircumstances have “materially and substantially changed” since the order was rendered. Id.\n\n§ 156.101(a)(1). The party seeking modification has the burden to establish these elements by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. See Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 589 (addressing modification\n\nof conservatorship).\n\n               As to the first element, there is no bright-line rule for determining what is in a\n\nchild’s best interest; each case must be determined on its unique set of facts. See Lenz v. Lenz,\n\n79 S.W.3d 10, 19 (Tex. 2002). In this case, it is fairly indisputable that Moreland and Coburn have\n\nbeen unable to co-parent amicably. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that they have not been\n\nable to communicate with one another without escalating conflict, and as a result, they have largely\n\nwithdrawn from communicating with each other. While Coburn blames Moreland for the conflict\n\nand lack of communication, there is ample evidence that Coburn contributed to or incited the\n\nconflict; there is also some evidence that for some period of time and to some extent he voluntarily\n\nceded to Holly his responsibility to communicate with Moreland and the girls’ therapists. The record\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\falso contains evidence that Coburn has challenged Moreland’s authority under the agreed divorce\n\ndecree to make regular medical and dental appointments for the girls and to re-enroll them in their\n\nextracurricular activities without his consent. The tensions between Coburn and Moreland also\n\nresulted in Moreland’s failing to effectively communicate with Coburn about an issue with P.C.’s\n\nreading ability.\n\n                Dr. Sherry testified that one of the parents should be given the exclusive right to make\n\nsignificant decisions regarding the children because Coburn and Moreland cannot effectively\n\nco-parent. Although Dr. Sherry did not recommend one parent over the other, she observed that\n\nMoreland is the “predominant” parent. The record supports this observation with undisputed\n\nevidence that Moreland has always been the primary caretaker for the children and principally\n\nresponsible for taking them to school, extracurricular activities, and medical appointments. In\n\ncontrast, Dr. Sherry testified that Coburn has a number of psychological issues that interfere with\n\nhis ability to respond appropriately to the children’s emotional needs. Dr. Sherry’s psychological\n\nevaluation of Moreland and Coburn was also introduced into evidence. In that report, Dr. Sherry\n\nfound that Moreland was likely to engage in cooperative relationships, which she said “bode[s] well\n\nfor both healthy parenting and the ability to co-parent with others.” She noted, however, that it was\n\nunlikely that Moreland could effectively co-parent with Coburn due to his “existing\n\npsychopathology.” Of particular note, Dr. Sherry concluded that “the likelihood of [Coburn’s]\n\nability to engage in effective co-parenting is seriously limited as is his ability to place the needs of\n\nothers ahead of himself.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f               Whatever the cause or blame for the conflict, there is ample evidence that Moreland\n\nand Coburn cannot effectively co-parent. The trial court was therefore justified in selecting one\n\nparent as exclusive decision-maker to avoid conflict. Rather than taking a kitchen-sink approach,\n\nthe trial court made a reasoned analysis in determining which decisions should be exercised\n\nexclusively by one parent because they are likely to arise more frequently than other matters over\n\nwhich the parties retain joint decision-making authority. At the conclusion of the trial, the court\n\nexplained that the high-conflict nature of the case warranted the assignment of exclusive\n\ndecision-making rights for education and health care to provide a measure of stability for these\n\nimportant decisions and to avoid the parties’ “coming back to court every time a decision needs to\n\nbe made.”    Moreover, there have been actual conflicts and lapses regarding the children’s\n\neducational needs and participation in extracurricular activities due to the dynamic between\n\nMoreland and Coburn. Furthermore, Moreland is and has been the primary parent, and she retains\n\nprimary possession of the children, which makes the trial court’s assignment of those rights to her\n\nlogical. Finally, there is evidence that Coburn’s ability to place his children’s needs before his own\n\nis impaired. See Garza v. Garza, 217 S.W.3d 538, 553-54 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, no pet.)\n\n(trial court did not abuse discretion in awarding exclusive health-care and education decision-making\n\nrights to father in light of evidence that mother “had difficulty thinking rationally and logically,\n\ncontrolling her mood swings and anger, and arriving at a logical solution when faced with a\n\nproblem”). The trial court retains broad discretion in crafting the rights and duties of each\n\nconservator to promote the children’s best interests. See Swaab v. Swaab, 282 S.W.3d 519, 532\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. dism’d w.o.j.). On this record and under the highly\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fdeferential standard of review applied in modification cases, we cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in granting Moreland the exclusive right to make education and health-care\n\ndecisions in the children’s best interests.19\n\n                Coburn did not challenge proof of the second modification element, that is, a material\n\nand substantial change in circumstances since rendition of the agreed divorce decree. Even if his\n\nbrief could be construed to include such a challenge, there is ample evidence from which the trial\n\ncourt could have concluded that there was a material and substantial change in the parties’ ability\n\nto effectively co-parent since rendition of the agreed divorce decree. In addition, Coburn’s\n\ncounter-petition for modification of parental rights—which included the very rights at issue in this\n\nappeal—alleged a material and substantial change in circumstances, which constitutes a judicial\n\nadmission as to this element. See In re A.E.A., 406 S.W.3d 404, 410 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2013,\n\nno pet.).\n\n                In sum, Coburn has not shown that the trial court acted in an unreasonable and\n\narbitrary manner or without reference to guiding principles when it found that it was in E.C.’s and\n\nP.C.’s best interests for Moreland to be awarded the exclusive right to make educational and\n\nnon-invasive health-care decisions. We overrule Coburn’s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n        19\n           Coburn argues that there must be sufficient evidence of parental conflict, apathy, or\nneglect with regard to the specific parental rights that have been limited. While the parties have cited\na number of cases in which such circumstances have existed and were noted, Coburn has cited no\nauthority—nor have we found any—suggesting that the trial court’s discretion is so limited.\n\n                                                  29\n\f       Child Support\n\n               In his third appellate issue, Coburn challenges the trial court’s award of increased\n\nchild support.20 Coburn contends the trial court abused its discretion by (1) modifying his\n\nchild-support obligation based on a finding that he is voluntarily underemployed; (2) erroneously\n\ncalculating the “proven needs” of the children; (3) failing to provide specific reasons for imposing\n\nchild support in excess of the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 of the Family Code; and\n\n(4) considering his interim voluntary support payments in modifying his support obligation.\n\n               A trial court has the authority to modify a child-support obligation if “the\n\ncircumstances of the child or a person affected by the order have materially and substantially\n\nchanged” since the rendition of the prior order of child support.             See Tex. Fam. Code\n\n§ 156.401(a)(1). The absence of a material and substantial change is a theme that underlies the core\n\nchild-support dispute in this case. Because this matter logically precedes the specific allegations of\n\nerror, we begin our analysis by considering whether modification of the child-support terms in the\n\nagreed divorce decree was warranted by sufficient evidence of a material and substantial change in\n\ncircumstances. The party seeking modification has the burden to establish these elements by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. See Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 589 (addressing modification of\n\nconservatorship).\n\n               In contesting the trial court’s finding of voluntary underemployment, Coburn asserts\n\nthat neither his income nor his “earning potential” changed following the divorce. He contends that\n\n\n\n       20\n           Coburn’s briefing lacks clarity regarding exactly what he contends his child-support\nobligation should be, but his position on that matter is ultimately immaterial in light of our\ndisposition of this appellate issue.\n\n                                                 30\n\fthe only material changes of circumstance were that he became romantically involved with a wealthy\n\nwoman whose generosity and support have enabled him to pursue a business venture that currently\n\npays him no income but has the potential for being very lucrative. As Coburn points out, the\n\nresources of a new spouse are not relevant to determining the net resources of a child-support\n\nobligor, see Tex. Fam. Code § 156.404, and the trial court correctly refused to consider such\n\nevidence. Independent of Holly’s financial resources, however, there is sufficient evidence from\n\nwhich the trial court could have properly concluded that Coburn’s circumstances changed in that he\n\nwas not voluntarily unemployed or underemployed when the divorce decree was executed but\n\nbecame so when he began pursuing his new venture-capital business.\n\n                In the agreed divorce decree, the parties acknowledged that Coburn was unemployed,\n\nand his child-support obligation was set taking that circumstance into consideration. However, the\n\ndecree also reflects—with bolding and underlining for emphasis—that the parties anticipated that\n\nCoburn would be seeking employment more commensurate with his earning potential and expressly\n\ncontemplated recalculation of his child-support obligation on the happening of that event.21\n\nConsistent with the expectations embodied in the agreed divorce decree, Coburn had actually\n\n\n       21\n            The agreed divorce decree provides:\n\n              For the period of time while KIRK BRAND COBURN is unemployed, IT IS\n       ORDERED that KIRK BRAND COBURN is obligated to pay and shall pay to\n       JANET MORELAND COBURN child support for two (2) children in the amount of\n       $600.00 per month . . . .\n\n       ....\n\n              FURTHER, IT IS ORDERED that as soon as KIRK BRAND COBURN\n       gains employment, his monthly child support obligation will be recalculated\n       pursuant to the guidelines as set forth in the Texas Family Code.\n\n                                                  31\n\fcommunicated to Moreland, either before or contemporaneously with the execution of the agreed\n\ndivorce decree, that he was interviewing for a job in Houston. The changed circumstances that are\n\nrelevant to this case do not involve Coburn’s actual income or earning potential; the evidence reflects\n\nthat those circumstances have remained substantially the same since rendition of the agreed divorce\n\ndecree. What has changed is that Coburn has voluntarily ceased efforts to find employment that\n\nwould provide an income sufficient to support his children. Evidence of the change from involuntary\n\nunemployment on the date of the agreed divorce decree to voluntary underemployment thereafter is\n\nsufficient to support the trial court’s finding of a material and substantial change of circumstances.\n\nSee, e.g., Baucom v. Crews, 819 S.W.2d 628, 631 (Tex. App.—Waco 1991, no writ) (proof\n\nthat circumstances of child or managing conservator have materially and substantially changed\n\nis not necessary if there is evidence that obligor’s circumstances have materially and\n\nsubstantially changed).\n\n                Coburn suggests that the relevant time period for determining whether there has been\n\na material and substantial change of circumstances is fixed as the period of time between the date\n\nof the original divorce decree and the date the modification petition was filed. He asserts that, in the\n\npresent case, his eventual acknowledgment of being voluntarily underemployed falls outside the\n\nshort 41-day time frame between those events. Using the petition-filing date as an evidentiary cutoff,\n\nhe intimates that there is evidence only that he was in the process of becoming voluntarily\n\nunderemployed at that time but no evidence that he was actually voluntarily underemployed until\n\nsome later date preceding the bench trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f                We are aware that there are several cases stating that the pertinent time period under\n\nsection 156.401 is the period of time between the date of the order to be modified and “the time the\n\nmodification is sought.” See, e.g., London v. London, 94 S.W.3d 139, 144 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (citing Tucker v. Tucker, 908 S.W.2d 530, 532 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n1995, writ denied); Hammond v. Hammond, 898 S.W.2d 406, 407-08 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1995,\n\nno writ); Penick v. Penick, 780 S.W.2d 407, 408 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1989, writ denied); Liveris\n\nv. Ross, 690 S.W.2d 60, 61 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1985, no writ)). Coburn construes\n\nthe phrase “the time when modification is sought” as referring exclusively to the date the\n\nmodification petition was filed, and as a result, he appears to be asserting that the trial court cannot\n\nconsider evidence arising after that date.\n\n                The relevant time frame was not at issue in the cases using the “time when\n\nmodification is sought” language. We cannot find a single case in which the ending date of the\n\ncomparative time frame was a substantive issue, let alone one expressly limiting evidence to the\n\ncircumstances existing on the day the modification suit was filed. Rather, when discussing the\n\nevidentiary comparison that is required, many cases have stated that there must be evidence of the\n\nrelevant party’s “current” circumstances, not circumstances at the time the modification petition was\n\nfiled. See, e.g., In re C.C.J., 244 S.W.3d 911, 917-18 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.) (using\n\nboth); Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 594 n.1 (“record must contain both historical and current evidence\n\nof the relevant circumstances” in order to make material and substantial change comparison);\n\nLondon v. London, 192 S.W.3d 6, 15 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied); see also\n\nHammond, 898 S.W.2d at 408 (stating that comparison was not possible because father only\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fpresented evidence of financial condition at time of modification hearing and not at time of original\n\nchild-support order). Furthermore, there are cases declaring that the relevant end point is when the\n\nmodification hearing occurs. See Swate v. Crook, 991 S.W.2d 450, 453 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1999, pet. denied) (“The father had the burden of proving a change in his circumstances,\n\nwhich means he was required to present evidence of his financial condition at the time of the 1993\n\norder and evidence of his financial condition at the time of the hearing.”), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Smith v. Brown, 51 S.W.3d 376, 381 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied);\n\nBradshaw v. Billups, 587 S.W.2d 61, 62 (Tex. Civ. App.—Eastland 1979, no writ) (relevant time\n\nperiod for determining material and substantial change is date of original decree and time of\n\nmodification hearing). By and large, the cases Coburn cites do not fairly elucidate what is intended\n\nby the phrase “the time when modification is sought,” do not tie that particular language to the\n\nstatutory language, and above all, do not hold that the filing date of the modification petition is an\n\nevidentiary or claim cut-off date. In short, these cases are not instructive with respect to the\n\nargument Coburn appears to be making. Most importantly, we believe that imposing the cut-off date\n\nCoburn suggests would be inconsistent with section 156.401 and the Family Code as a whole.\n\n                Section 156.401 authorizes the trial court to modify a child-support order in the event\n\nof changed circumstances “since . . . the date of the order’s rendition” (or on the happening of other\n\nevents not relevant here). Tex. Fam. Code § 156.401(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Pertinent to the\n\ncircumstances presented in this case, the starting date prescribed by the statute is the date of the order\n\nthat is being modified, and the end date is, logically, when the trial court actually modifies the\n\nsupport order. Id. (“[T]he court may modify an order that provides for the support of a child . . . [if]\n\n\n\n                                                   34\n\fthe circumstances . . . have materially and substantially changed since . . . the date of the order’s\n\nrendition . . . .”). Nothing in section 156.401 limits the scope of relevant evidence to the\n\ncircumstances in effect on the date a modification petition is filed, nor is any such limitation found\n\nelsewhere in Chapter 156.\n\n                Moreover, treating the petition date as an evidentiary cut-off date would be\n\ninconsistent with the unique statutory scheme applicable to SAPCR proceedings. In a typical civil\n\ncase, the date the petition is filed can implicate significant issues like a statute of limitations and the\n\ntrial court’s jurisdiction. In SAPCR proceedings, however, the trial court retains continuing,\n\nexclusive jurisdiction to modify a prior final order. Id. § 155.001. The only temporal limitation on\n\nthe court’s authority to modify a support order is that circumstances have changed materially and\n\nsubstantially since the prior order, and the only limitation on a party’s ability to file a modification\n\nsuit is that the request be in good faith and not for the purpose of harassment. See id. §§ 156.005,\n\n.401. Given these circumstances, it would be pointless to require successive filings when additional\n\nor different facts bearing on the modification request arise while the proceeding is pending.22 As\n\nlong as a modification petition is filed in good faith, we see no requirement—and no reason—to\n\nlimit the trial court’s consideration of changed circumstances occurring after the modification suit\n\nwas filed, if supported by appropriate pleadings. Any mischief that might ensue without the\n\ntemporal evidentiary limitation Coburn advances would be ameliorated by application of section\n\n156.005 of the Family Code, which requires the trial court to award attorney’s fees against a party\n\n\n        22\n          To the extent such action might be required, Moreland did seek modification of Coburn’s\nchild-support obligation shortly before the modification hearing based on changed circumstances,\nand there was no objection to the amended pleading. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 62, 63, 70 (pertaining to\namended pleadings).\n\n                                                    35\n\fwho files a frivolous or harassing modification suit. See id. § 156.005 (“If the court finds that a suit\n\nfor modification is filed frivolously or is designed to harass a party, the court shall tax attorney’s fees\n\nas costs against the offending party.”).\n\n                In sum, under the unique statutory scheme applicable to modification proceedings,\n\nthere need only be a good-faith basis for instituting a modification suit and, at the end of the day,\n\nsufficient evidence that there has been a material and substantial change of circumstances warranting\n\nmodification of the support order. See id. §§ 156.002 (anyone with standing can file modification\n\nsuit), .004 (rules of civil procedure apply in modification suit), .005 (trial court must award\n\nattorney’s fees if modification suit is filed frivolously or is designed to harass a party); see also Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 13 (governing sanctions for frivolous and bad-faith pleadings). In the present case, there\n\nis sufficient evidence that Moreland had a good-faith basis for seeking modification of the\n\nchild-support order based on (1) the express terms of the agreed divorce decree, (2) Coburn’s\n\napparent change in financial conditions shortly after rendition of the agreed divorce decree, and\n\n(3) his subsequent refusal to disclose the circumstances of that change. There is also sufficient\n\nevidence that the parties considered Coburn to be involuntarily unemployed on the date of the agreed\n\ndecree, and since that time he has become voluntarily underemployed. Accordingly, we hold that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was authorized to modify the\n\nchild-support terms based on a material and substantial change in Coburn’s circumstances.\n\n                In addition to the foregoing issues, Coburn complains that in increasing his\n\nchild-support obligation from $600 per month to $2,716.25 per month, the trial court (1) applied an\n\nimproper legal standard in determining that he was voluntarily underemployed and thus wrongfully\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f“deviated” from the statutory child-support guidelines on that basis, (2) failed to specify the reasons\n\nfor awarding more than the percentage guideline maximum in section 154.124, (3) incorrectly\n\ncalculated the children’s support needs, and (4) improperly relied on his voluntary support payments\n\nunder agreed temporary orders. We address these matters in turn.\n\n                Section 154.066 of the Family Code provides that “[i]f the actual income of the\n\nobligor is significantly less than what the obligor could earn because of intentional unemployment\n\nor underemployment, the court may apply the support guidelines to the earning potential of the\n\nobligor.” Id. § 154.066(a).23 At trial, Coburn essentially conceded voluntary underemployment, and\n\nhe does not dispute that evidence on appeal. Rather, he contends that, in order to conclude that he\n\nhad any monthly net resources, the trial court was required to find that he was voluntarily\n\nunderemployed for the purpose of decreasing his child support payments. In support of this position,\n\nhowever, he relies on several cases subsequently disapproved by the Texas Supreme Court. In Iliff\n\nv. Iliff, the supreme court held that\n\n\n        Texas Family Code section 154.066 contains no requirement of proof that an obligor\n        be intentionally unemployed or underemployed for the purposes of avoiding child\n        support. Where a trial court determines that an obligor is intentionally unemployed\n        or underemployed, it is in the court’s discretion to set child support based on earning\n        potential.\n\n\n\n\n        23\n           The same intentional unemployment/underemployment analysis under section 154.066\nmay be applied in both original child-support orders and modifications of existing child-support\norders. See Tex. Fam. Code § 156.402 (allowing the court to consider “the child support guidelines\n. . . under Chapter 154 to determine whether there has been a material or substantial change of\ncircumstances under this chapter that warrants a modification of an existing child support order if\nthe modification is in the best interest of the child”).\n\n                                                  37\n\f339 S.W.3d 74, 83 & n.8 (Tex. 2011). The court expressly observed that the limitation Coburn\n\nsuggests here is found nowhere in section 154.066. See id. at 80-81 (“Because section 154.066 is\n\nunambiguous, we decline to read into the statute an extra proof requirement that the Legislature did\n\nnot express.”). Coburn contends, however, that Iliff does not apply in this case because the facts in\n\nIliff involve what he calls a “guidelines” child-support award, rather than a “deviation” from the\n\nchild-support guidelines, which he says occurred in this case. Although this distinction is likewise\n\nabsent from the express language of section 154.066, Coburn argues that a more restrictive definition\n\nof the term “intentional” is applicable when the trial court awards more than would result from strict\n\napplication of the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 of the Family Code. Coburn presumes,\n\nwithout any substantive explanation, that a different “intent” standard applies to the extent an\n\nobligor’s earning potential is found to exceed $7,500 per month.\n\n               Although the supreme court has not made the distinction Coburn suggests, it is\n\napparent from the facts in Iliff that the child-support award in that case was based on an earning\n\npotential that was found to be less than $7,500 per month, which means that the child-support award\n\nat issue there was calculated using the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 of the Family Code\n\nas applied to the obligor’s earning potential. See id. at 77. Section 154.125 is “specifically designed\n\nto apply to situations in which the obligor’s monthly net resources are not greater than $7,500” and\n\nprescribes for such individuals a schedule of percentages that presumptively apply to the obligor’s\n\nnet resources, but only “[i]f the obligor’s monthly net resources are not greater than [$7,500].” Tex.\n\nFam. Code § 154.125(b). A trial court may, however, deviate from those percentage guidelines if\n\nthe evidence rebuts the presumption that application of those amounts is in the child’s best interest.\n\n\n\n                                                  38\n\fSee id. § 154.123(a). The court may consider a number of specifically delineated factors and “any\n\nother reason” in making that determination. See id. § 154.123(b).\n\n               In the present case, the court determined that Coburn’s earning potential is $200,000\n\nper year and his net resources exceed $12,000 per month. Based on these findings, which Coburn\n\nhas not contested, section 154.125 is not applicable. Consequently, the trial court calculated\n\nCoburn’s child-support obligation under section 154.126, which provides a bifurcated analysis for\n\ndetermining child support when the obligor’s monthly net resources exceed $7,500. Under section\n\n154.126, the court “shall presumptively apply the percentage guidelines [from section 154.125] to\n\nthe portion of the obligor’s net resources that does not exceed [$7,500].” Id. § 154.126(a). Then,\n\nthe trial court may, but is not required to, award additional child support based on the child’s actual\n\nsupport needs. Id. If the court so elects, the court must calculate the child’s proven needs, subtract\n\nthe presumptive guideline amount from that figure, and allocate the remainder of the child’s proven\n\nneeds between the parties depending on their income and circumstances. Id. § 154.126(b). The\n\namount of a child-support award under section 154.126 cannot, however, exceed 100 percent of the\n\nchild’s proven needs. Id.\n\n               Accordingly, contrary to Coburn’s claim on appeal, the trial court did not deviate\n\nfrom the percentage guidelines; rather, the trial court applied section 154.126 because section\n\n154.125 by its express terms was not applicable. In accordance with section 154.126, the trial court\n\napplied the presumptive percentage guidelines and then exercised its discretion to award additional\n\nsums above the percentage guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  39\n\f               Implicit in Coburn’s argument is either that the limitation he advances is necessary\n\nto avoid inflated child-support awards or that section 154.066 does not apply to child-support awards\n\nunder section 154.126. We disagree on both counts. In Iliff, the supreme court addressed concerns\n\nabout the potential for unlimited child-support awards based on earning potential and noted that\n\nsection 154.066 only applies when an obligor makes “significantly less” money because of\n\nintentional unemployment or underemployment. Iliff, 339 S.W.3d at 82. The court further noted\n\nthat section 154.066 is permissive and that the trial court’s discretion is tempered by the limits set\n\nin chapter 154 and by the requirement that there be sufficient evidentiary support for a finding of\n\nintentional unemployment or underemployment. Id. As an aside, the court further noted that one\n\nof the limitations in chapter 154 is that the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 apply only to\n\nthe first $7,500 of the obligor’s net monthly resources. Id. at 82 n.7. What was not implicated by\n\nthe facts in Iliff, and thus not discussed, is that even when an obligor has an earning potential in\n\nexcess of $7,500, child-support awards are not unlimited because they are capped at the proven needs\n\nof the child. See Tex. Fam. Code § 154.126.\n\n               Although not directly stating so, Coburn seems to infer from the lower court’s opinion\n\nin Iliff that the phrase “support guidelines” used in section 154.066 refers only to the percentage\n\nguidelines in section 154.125.24 The supreme court did not make such a holding, and we believe\n\nsuch a construction would be incorrect. Chapter 154 of the Family Code devotes an entire\n\nsubchapter to what it deems “child support guidelines.” See id. § 154.121 (“The child support\n\nguidelines in this subchapter are intended to guide the court in determining an equitable amount of\n\n\n       24\n          Coburn does not cite the supreme court’s opinion in Iliff except as subsequent history for\nthe lower-court opinion.\n\n                                                 40\n\fchild support.”). The percentage guidelines in section 154.125 play a prominent, but not exclusive,\n\nrole in the overall support-guideline scheme. Among the support guidelines in chapter 154 is section\n\n154.126, in which the percentage guidelines are but one component of the guidelines for determining\n\nchild support when the obligor’s net resources are in excess of $7,500 per month. Section 154.066\n\ncontains no express or implied limitation that restricts its application to awards under section\n\n154.125 or to the percentage guidelines found in that section. Accordingly, we hold that section\n\n154.066 applies to the child-support award in this case, and as the supreme court held in Iliff, nothing\n\nin that section requires proof that an obligor be intentionally unemployed or underemployed for the\n\npurpose of avoiding child support.\n\n               We further reject Coburn’s contention that the trial court failed to specify its reasons\n\nfor awarding more than the percentage guideline amount. Under section 154.130 of the Family\n\nCode, “if the amount of child support ordered by the court varies from the amount computed by\n\napplying the percentage guidelines under section 154.125,” the trial court must issue a variety of\n\nspecific findings, including “the specific reasons that the amount of child support per month ordered\n\nby the court varies from the amount computed by applying the percentage guidelines under Section\n\n154.125 or 154.129, as applicable.” Id. § 154.130(a)(3), (b). In this case, the percentage guidelines\n\nunder section 154.125 are applicable as a component of the section 154.126 guideline, and the trial\n\ncourt expressly found that (1) Coburn is intentionally underemployed, has the ability to earn\n\n$200,000 per year, and has net monthly resources of $12,736.11, (2) application of the percentage\n\nguidelines in section 154.125 would be unjust or inappropriate and not in the best interests of the\n\nchildren, (3) the proven needs of the children are $3,557.50 per month, and (4) it is in the children’s\n\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fbest interests that Coburn be assigned one half of the children’s proven needs above the percentage\n\nguideline amount. These findings reveal that the trial court exercised its discretion under section\n\n154.066 to base the child-support obligation on Coburn’s earning potential, rather than his actual\n\nincome; that based on Coburn’s earning potential as found by the court, section 154.125 is\n\ninapplicable but the percentage guidelines in that section presumptively apply to the first $7,500 of\n\nCoburn’s net resources, as specified in section 154.126; that the trial court exercised its discretion\n\nto award additional child support under section 154.126 based on the children’s actual support needs\n\nas found by the court; and that the trial court divided the excess support needs equally between the\n\ntwo parents. These findings, which are articulated in both the modification order and the findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law, are specific enough to explain why the trial court awarded child\n\nsupport in excess of the percentage guidelines in section 154.125. This is all that is required under\n\nsection 154.130.\n\n               Next, Coburn challenges the trial court’s calculation of the children’s support needs.\n\nAt trial Moreland introduced evidence concerning the actual expenses incurred to support herself and\n\nthe children each month, including a monthly expense statement she prepared. The expense\n\nstatement included mortgage and household expenses, food and groceries, clothing, medical and\n\nmental-health care and insurance, transportation, life insurance, childcare fees, children’s activities\n\nand entertainment, and other incidentals such as personal grooming and charitable giving.\n\nConsidering Moreland’s evidence, which showed monthly expenses in excess of $10,000, the trial\n\ncourt determined that some of the expenses could be segregated between Moreland and the children\n\nwhile other expenses were not readily divisible between them. With regard to the non-divisible\n\n\n\n                                                  42\n\fexpenses, the trial court allocated to the children one-third of the rental, mortgage, household, and\n\ntransportation expenses and one-half of the expenses for groceries, meals away from home, and\n\nincidentals. Expenses attributable solely to the children—including school lunches, life insurance,\n\nchild care, and summer camps—were fully credited to the children’s support needs. The court\n\ndisregarded expenses that could have been segregated but were not, including medical and\n\nmental-health care, clothing, and shoes. Ultimately, the trial court determined that E.C.’s and P.C.’s\n\nproven needs are $3,557.50 per month. As required by section 154.126, the trial court subtracted\n\nthe percentage guideline maximum of $1,875 from this figure, then divided the excess support needs\n\nequally between the parents to arrive at Coburn’s modified support obligation of $2,716.25.\n\n               Coburn complains that the trial court arbitrarily allocated one-third of the mortgage\n\nand transportation expenses to the children and 100% of the life insurance to the children. He also\n\ncomplains that the trial court improperly included “lifestyle” expenses for maid service, cable\n\ntelevision, yard maintenance, caretaking of the household, cleaning supplies, vehicle maintenance,\n\ncar insurance, and life insurance, which he contends are not properly considered to be “needs” of the\n\nchildren. Although we question whether Coburn properly preserved these complaints for appellate\n\nreview,25 nonetheless, assuming that he did, we hold that the trial court’s allocations were reasonable\n\nand that the inclusion of the disputed expense categories was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n       25\n           In the trial court, Coburn complained about the admission of Moreland’s expenses exhibit\nto the extent it was offered “as a summary of her testimony.” Coburn also generally challenged the\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the needs calculation and requested that the\nlanguage in the order be “modified to reflect that the needs of the children were not proven.” Coburn\ndid not, however, make the specific complaints that he now makes on appeal. See Tex. R. App. P.\n33.1 (timely, specific objection required to preserve issue for appellate review).\n\n                                                  43\n\f               The phrase “needs of the child” is not defined in the Family Code, but courts\n\nhave long held that it is not limited to the “bare necessities of life.” Rodriguez v. Rodriguez,\n\n860 S.W.2d 414, 417 n.3 (Tex. 1993) (applying prior version of Family Code that included similar\n\nlanguage). As a result, the trial court must determine what the needs are on a case-by-case basis by\n\nfollowing the “paramount guiding principle: the best interest of the child.” Id. Coburn points to\n\nno authority that requires segregation of non-divisible expenses, prohibits the trial court from making\n\na reasonable allocation of non-divisible expenses, or prohibits the court from considering the\n\ndisputed expenses as needs of the children. Indeed, while the phrase “needs of the child” is not so\n\nexpansive as to encompass the most extravagant demands, the trial court is given broad discretion\n\nto determine what a child’s reasonable needs are.              See MacGillivray v. MacGillivray,\n\nNo. 04-10-00109-CV, 2011 WL 2150352, at *3 (Tex. App.—San Antonio, June 1, 2011, pet.\n\ndenied) (mem. op.); Dolan v. Martine, No. 03-03-00112-CV, 2004 WL 314972, at *3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin Feb. 20, 2004, no pet.) (mem. op.). We hold that the trial court’s findings related to\n\nE.C.’s and P.C.’s support needs are within the reasonable bounds of its broad discretionary authority\n\nand the evidence presented.26\n\n\n\n\n       26\n           We further note that, even if the disputed expenses were excluded, the trial court did not\nrequire Coburn to pay an amount in excess of 100 percent of the proven needs of the children in\nviolation of section 124.126(b). Without an objection advising the trial court of the complaints\nCoburn now raises, we would be disinclined to reverse for the trial court to make a different\nallocation of the children’s support needs in excess of the presumptive percentage-guideline\nmaximum. See Scott v. Younts, 926 S.W.2d 415, 422 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1996, writ denied)\n(court did not abuse its discretion in setting support amount where amount awarded was less than\n100 percent of child’s proven needs and was within statutorily required calculations).\n\n\n                                                  44\n\f                In Coburn’s final challenge to the child-support award, he contends the trial court\n\nimproperly considered his voluntary payment of $1,875 per month when it increased his\n\nchild-support obligation to $2,716.25 per month. The Family Code specifically provides that “[a]\n\nhistory of support voluntarily provided in excess of the court order does not constitute cause to\n\nincrease the amount of an existing child support order.” Tex. Fam. Code § 156.403. Thus, any\n\nvoluntary payments made by Coburn in the past do not provide a basis to increase the amount of\n\nchild support. Coburn alleges that the trial court expressly relied on his voluntary support payments\n\nin violation of section 156.403, citing the following provision in the trial court’s modification order:\n\n\n        IT IS ORDERED that the child support increase under the Temporary Orders filed\n        in this case is acknowledged as KIRK COBURN’S voluntary increase and IT IS\n        ORDERED that the child support was increased retroactively for each month that\n        child support was paid to match the actual child support received by JANET\n        MORELAND. The Court finds that there is no arrearage or overpayment as of June\n        30, 2012.\n\n\n                Thus, in the modification order, the trial court expressly acknowledged that Coburn’s\n\npayment of $1,875 under the prior temporary orders was voluntary and ordered that child support\n\nwas retroactively increased only to the extent of matching amounts actually paid so as to eliminate\n\nany dispute as to an arrearage or overpayment. In finding of fact 45, the trial court likewise\n\ndetermined that there was no arrearage or overpayment of child support as of June 30, 2012. The\n\nincreased child-support obligation of $2,716.25 per month was ordered to begin on July 1, 2012, and\n\nwas not made retroactive. The trial court never cited Coburn’s voluntary payment as a basis for\n\ncalculating child-support going forward, and no reasonable inference to the contrary is found in the\n\nrecord. We conclude that neither the modification order nor the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\n\n                                                  45\n\fconclusions of law supports Coburn’s claim that the trial court based the modified child-support\n\nobligation, in whole or part, on his agreement to voluntarily increase his support payments while the\n\nmodification suit was pending.\n\n               In any case, as previously discussed, the trial court’s support order is amply supported\n\nby sections 154.126 and 154.066 of the Family Code as applied to the court’s findings of voluntary\n\nunderemployment, earning capacity of $200,000 per year, net resources of $12,736.11, the children’s\n\nproven needs of $3,557.50 per month, and equitable division of the children’s additional support\n\nneeds. See id. §§ 154.066 (governing intentional unemployment or underemployment), .126\n\n(governing application of guidelines to net resources exceeding $7,500 per month).27 Consequently,\n\nwe conclude that Coburn’s complaint about his voluntary support payments is without merit.\n\n               Because some evidence of a substantive and probative character supports the trial\n\ncourt’s child-support award, Coburn has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Coburn’s third issue.\n\n\n       Attorney’s Fee Award\n\n               In Coburn’s final appellate issue, he contends the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it awarded Moreland a significant portion of her attorney’s fees because she was not the\n\n“successful” or “prevailing” party and no finding of “good cause” was made or supported by the\n\n\n       27\n            To the extent one could read the trial court’s modification order in the way Coburn\nsuggests, we observe that he submitted to the trial court a proposed order using identical language\nand represented that the order remedied his objections to a proposed order previously submitted by\nMoreland’s counsel. Although Coburn objected to other aspects of the child-support provisions in\nan accompanying letter and in various motions filed with the trial court, he never complained that\nthe trial court violated section 156.403 or improperly considered his voluntary support payments.\nThus, we conclude in the alternative that the complaint is waived. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\n\n                                                 46\n\frecord. Although Moreland successfully defended Coburn’s modification counter-petition and was\n\nafforded material relief on her own petition, the trial court denied her requests to be granted several\n\nexclusive decision-making rights and her request that Coburn be required to exercise possession in\n\nTravis County and take the children to their extracurricular activities and events during that time.\n\nThe trial court also awarded Moreland slightly more than one-third of the increased child support\n\nshe requested.28 Because Moreland was awarded less than all the relief she had requested, Coburn\n\ncontends that she is not a “prevailing party” and that the trial court was required to find both “good\n\ncause” to award her any amount of attorney’s fees and that the fees awarded were incurred “for the\n\nbenefit of the children.” We disagree.\n\n                Under the Family Code, the trial court has discretion to “render judgment for\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees and expenses and order the judgment and postjudgment interest to be paid\n\ndirectly to an attorney.” Id. § 106.002; Bruni v. Bruni, 924 S.W.2d 366, 368 (Tex. 1996) (award of\n\nattorney’s fees is in trial court’s discretion). As Moreland observes, section 106.002 does not include\n\nlanguage imposing either a “prevailing party” or “good cause” requirement, and we are not\n\npersuaded that these standards should be read into section 106.002, as Coburn suggests. Compare\n\nTex. Fam. Code § 106.002 with id. §§ 152.312 (“The court shall award the prevailing party . . .\n\nnecessary and reasonable expenses . . . including . . . attorney’s fees . . . , unless the party from whom\n\nfees or expenses are sought establishes that the award would be clearly inappropriate.”), 154.012\n\n(requiring court to award attorney’s fees to obligor if obligee fails to return excess child-support\n\n\n\n        28\n          Moreland’s live pleading requests only recalculation of the child-support obligation and\ndoes not specify a particular amount of child support; however, she testified at trial that she was\nseeking $6,000 per month in child support.\n\n                                                   47\n\fpayment unless court finds “good cause” and “states the reasons supporting that finding”), and\n\n157.167 (mandating award of attorney’s fees in child-support enforcement action if complainant\n\nprevails unless court finds “good cause”and “states the reasons supporting that finding”); cf.\n\ngenerally Tucker v. Thomas, 419 S.W.3d 292, 296-300 (Tex. 2013) (discussing and affording legal\n\nsignificance to textual differences in various attorney’s fees provisions in Family Code). When\n\nthe legislature intends to impose a prevailing-party or good-cause requirement, it does so with\n\nexpress language.29\n\n               Although Coburn cites Family Code cases that have employed a “successful party”\n\nor “good cause” analysis, those cases have either (1) applied prior versions of section 106.002 that\n\nrequired an award of attorney’s fees to be “taxed as costs” or (2) relied on cases that had applied\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           Cf., e.g., Tex. Alco. Bev.

App.—Dallas 1980, no writ). Although prior\n\nversions of section 106.002 allowed recovery of attorney’s fees as “costs,” the current version of the\n\nFamily Code does not and instead distinguishes between costs and attorney’s fees. See Tex. Fam.\n\nCode §§ 106.001 (award of costs), .002 (award of attorney’s fees and expenses); cf. id. § 156.005\n\n(“If the court finds that a suit for modification is filed frivolously or is designed to harass a party, the\n\ncourt shall tax attorney’s fees as costs against the offending party.”). As a result, the attorney’s fees\n\nthe trial court awarded in this case are not considered to be “costs.” Cf. In re Nalle Plastics Family\n\nLtd. P’ship, 406 S.W.3d 168, 175-76 (Tex. 2013). This distinction is significant because specific\n\n\n\n        30\n           In 1973 the legislature enacted section 11.18(a) of the Family Code, which provided: “In\nany proceeding under this subtitle, the court may award costs as in other civil cases. Reasonable\nattorney’s fees may be taxed as costs . . . .” Act of June 15, 1973, 63d Leg., R.S., ch. 543, § 1,\n1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1411, 1419. In 1981 section 11.18(a) was amended to omit the “as in other\ncivil cases” language. Act of June 10, 1981, 67th Leg., R.S., ch. 356, § 3, 1981 Tex. Gen. Laws 942,\n944. In 1995 section 11.18(a) was recodified into two newly numbered provisions—section\n106.001, governing costs to be awarded “in the same manner as in other civil cases in a suit,”\nand section 106.002, governing attorney’s fees awarded “as costs.” Act of Apr. 20, 1995,\n74th Leg., R.S., ch. 20, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 113, 133. The statute was amended to its current\nform in 2003, with the “as costs” language removed and replaced with “and expenses.” Act of\nJune 20, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 478, § 1, 2003 Tex. Gen. Laws 1744, 1744. As presently worded,\nsection 106.001, governing costs, no longer includes the “as in other civil cases” language. See Tex.\nFam. Code § 106.001.\n\n                                                    49\n\frules of procedure apply to awards of costs, and it is evident that the “successful party” and “good\n\ncause” requirements reflected in the cited cases were derived from those rules. See Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n131 (“The successful party to a suit shall recover of his adversary all costs incurred therein, except\n\nwhere otherwise provided.”), 141 (“The court may, for good cause, to be stated on the record,\n\nadjudge the costs otherwise than as provided by law or these rules.”); see also Reames, 604 S.W.2d\n\nat 337 (applying rules 131 and 141 to original version of section 106.002, which provided that\n\n“‘[r]easonable attorney’s fees may be taxed as costs’” and that costs may be awarded “as in other\n\ncivil cases”). Because attorney’s fees are not taxed as costs under the present incarnation of section\n\n106.002, neither the rules of procedure governing cost awards nor case law applying those rules are\n\napplicable in this case.\n\n               Moreover, when attorney’s fees were still being taxed as costs under the immediately\n\npreceding version of section 161.002, several courts observed that the statute “[did] not require a\n\nfamily court judgment to state good cause for adjudging costs against the successful party as is\n\nrequired in other civil cases” because “the legislature recognized the difficulty of deciding, in family\n\ncases, which party is successful.” Billeaud v. Billeaud, 697 S.W.2d 652, 655 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1985, no writ) (discussing amendment to former version of statute that deleted language\n\nrequiring costs to be awarded “as in other civil cases”); see also, e.g., Nichol v. Nichol,\n\nNo. 07-12-00035-CV, 2014 WL 199652, at *5 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Jan. 15, 2014, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (observing that “good cause” requirement had been superseded by statutory amendment in 1981\n\nwhen legislature removed “as in other civil cases” language from prior version of statute); Carlson,\n\n983 S.W.2d at 308-09 (quoting Billeaud, 697 S.W.2d at 655). Although success on the merits and\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\fgood cause may be relevant in considering whether a trial court abused its discretion in awarding one\n\nparty its attorney’s fees under section 106.002, those are not compulsory requirements under the\n\nstatute as presently worded.\n\n                Even in cases applying a “successful party” analysis, we discern no requirement that\n\na party win on all or even most of the requested relief. The absence of a bright-line rule (or even an\n\narticulable rule) in these cases is consistent with the broad discretion trial courts are afforded in\n\nawarding attorney’s fees in SAPCR proceedings. Cf. Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 21 (Tex. 2002).\n\nIt is further consistent with the legislature’s recognition that it is often difficult to identify a\n\n“successful party” in SAPCR proceedings, see Billeaud, 697 S.W.2d at 655, and with the principle\n\nthat the trial court is in the best position “to sense the ‘forces, powers, and influences’ that may not\n\nbe apparent from merely reading the record on appeal.” In re A.L.E., 279 S.W.3d 424, 427 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.).\n\n                Rarely is one party a clear-cut “winner” in a SAPCR proceeding, and the present case\n\nis no exception. Neither Moreland nor Coburn was a total victor. Although both prevailed to a\n\ndegree, Coburn acknowledges that Moreland achieved significant victory and repeatedly complains\n\non appeal that the trial court’s order was “one-sided.” Even without this concession, it is evident that\n\nMoreland prevailed in substantial and material ways, both in prosecuting her own modification\n\npetition and in defending against Coburn’s counter-petition. There is also more than enough\n\nevidence to support the trial court’s finding that the attorney’s fees awarded to Moreland were\n\nincurred “in order to protect the safety and welfare of the children who are the subject of this suit.”\n\nIn light of the record before the trial court and the deferential standard of review, we cannot conclude\n\n\n\n                                                  51\n\fthat the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Moreland the majority of her attorney’s fees.\n\nWe therefore overrule appellate issue four.\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n               Based on the foregoing analysis, we vacate the portion of the trial court’s judgment\n\nmodifying Coburn’s possession and access to E.C. and P.C. and dismiss as moot that portion of the\n\nappeal. Finding no abuse of discretion as asserted in appellate issues two, three, and four, we affirm\n\nthe remainder of the trial court’s modification order.\n\n\n\n                                       _____________________________________________\n\n                                       J.

We will vacate the trial court’s order in part, dismiss that part of the cause as moot,\n\nand affirm the remainder of the trial court’s modification order.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          A “high conflict case” is defined as “a suit affecting the parent-child relationship in which\nthe court finds that the parties have demonstrated an unusual degree of: (A) repetitiously resorting\nto the adjudicative process; (B) anger and distrust; and (C) difficulty in communicating about and\ncooperating in the care of their children.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.601(2).\n\f                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n               On February 11, 2011, Coburn and Moreland ended their twelve-year marriage with\n\nan agreed divorce decree. In the decree, Coburn and Moreland were appointed joint managing\n\nconservators of their young daughters, E.C. and P.C. Moreland was awarded the exclusive right to\n\ndesignate the children’s primary residence, and Coburn was awarded standard possession. Although\n\nboth parents were reportedly living in Austin when the decree was executed, the standard possession\n\nterms included modified possessory rights if the parents began living more than 100 miles apart\n\n(long-distance standard possession).\n\n               At the time the agreed divorce decree was executed, Coburn had not been regularly\n\nemployed for several years, and the terms of the decree recognized Coburn’s limited financial\n\nresources by awarding Moreland a larger share of the marital debts and by limiting Coburn’s\n\nchild-support obligation to $600 per month. The decree, however, contemplated that Coburn would\n\nbe seeking employment and specified that the $600 child-support obligation would exist only “[f]or\n\nthe period of time while KIRK BRAND COBURN is unemployed” and would be recalculated “as\n\nsoon as [he] gains employment.”2\n\n               A mere week after the divorce was finalized, there began a series of events and\n\ncircumstances that triggered a cascade of escalating discord between the parties that culminated in\n\nthe underlying modification proceeding and the trial-court order at issue in this appeal. The\n\nprecipitating event occurred when Coburn picked his daughters up for his first post-divorce weekend\n\n\n       2\n          The decree states: “[A]s soon as KIRK BRAND COBURN gains employment, his monthly\nchild support obligation will be recalculated pursuant to the guidelines as set forth in the Texas\nFamily Code. The new amount of child support shall start on the 1st day of the month following his\nstarting date of employment.”\n\n                                                2\n\fvisitation. Coburn arrived at Moreland’s home driving an expensive new vehicle of unknown origin,\n\nwhich caught Moreland’s attention. Coburn then took the children to Houston for the weekend after\n\nrepresenting to Moreland and his daughters that they would be staying in Austin for the visitation\n\nperiod. As Moreland and the girls would soon discover, Coburn had moved to Houston but had\n\nfailed to disclose that fact until he was en route to his new home with the girls.\n\n               When the girls discovered they were leaving Austin, they telephoned their mother.\n\nAccording to Moreland, she and the girls were frightened by the undisclosed diversion and unsettled\n\nby the discovery that Coburn had moved to Houston without their knowledge. Adding to their\n\ndistress, the children learned during the trip to Houston that their father had begun dating his\n\nchildhood sweetheart, Holly.3 When the children returned to Austin, E.C. informed Moreland of that\n\nfact and inquired whether Coburn had been dating his new girlfriend before the divorce. Moreland\n\nresponded that she was not able to answer that question, and she admittedly was upset and angry\n\nabout the situation.\n\n               Moreland was also keenly interested in what appeared to be a sudden improvement\n\nin Coburn’s financial resources. She was particularly upset by the fact that Coburn was driving a\n\nvery expensive new car when a mere week before she had taken responsibility for the majority of\n\nthe marital debt and agreed to accept a $600 monthly child-support payment. Moreland therefore\n\nset out to determine whether Coburn had additional financial resources to contribute to the support\n\nof his children.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Because Coburn and Holly now share the same surname, we refer to her by her first name\nto avoid confusion.\n\n                                                  3\n\f               Although Moreland knew that Holly was extremely wealthy and could have been\n\nsupporting Coburn financially, he had previously informed her that he was interviewing for a job in\n\nHouston. Moreland and her attorney, therefore, repeatedly requested that Coburn disclose the source\n\nof his newfound prosperity. Coburn refused the request, but in an e-mail exchange with Moreland’s\n\nattorney, he denied being employed and closed by saying “[i]t’s nice being kept,” implying that Holly\n\nwas his benefactor.\n\n               Shortly thereafter, Moreland’s attorney noticed Coburn’s deposition in an effort to\n\ndiscover information about his financial resources. At that time, Moreland had purchased airline\n\ntickets to take her daughters to Costa Rica for spring break, because the standard possession terms\n\nof the divorce decree granted her possession of the children at that time. In response to the\n\ndeposition notice, however, Coburn notified Moreland of his intent to exercise his long-distance\n\nstandard-possession rights since he was now residing more than 100 miles from the children; in\n\naccordance with those provisions, Coburn was entitled to possession of the girls during spring break\n\nevery year. When Moreland agreed to cancel Coburn’s deposition, the girls were permitted to go on\n\nthe Costa Rica trip as planned. After returning from the trip, Moreland filed the underlying\n\nmodification petition, seeking recalculation of child support pursuant to the terms of the agreed\n\ndivorce decree.\n\n               In the two months that followed, Coburn and Holly became engaged, and Coburn\n\nsubmitted to a deposition. At his deposition, Coburn testified that he did not have a job, but he was\n\nworking on starting a venture-capital business. As a result, he had not done anything to apply for\n\na job that would pay a salary and presently had no income. He further disclosed that Holly was\n\nsupporting him by paying (1) the debt he had assumed in the agreed divorce decree, (2) all of his\n\n                                                 4\n\fchild-support payments to Moreland, (3) his attorney’s fees for the modification proceeding, and\n\n(4) all of his monthly credit-card expenses. He explained that Holly had also paid the rent for his\n\nfurnished two-bedroom apartment and purchased the expensive new car he had been driving.\n\nCoburn acknowledged that Holly’s financial gifts predated execution of the agreed divorce decree\n\nby approximately two months. He further testified that he did not believe $600 per month in child\n\nsupport was “fair” and stated that he believed that an adequate and fair amount of child support for\n\nhis children was $300 per month.\n\n               Coburn was also questioned about his relationship with his daughters.               He\n\nacknowledged having a poor relationship with them at the time of the deposition, but he blamed\n\nMoreland for alienating them from him. Coburn did not accept responsibility for any of the friction\n\nand asserted that the only thing he had done to contribute to the situation was that he had married\n\nMoreland in the first place.\n\n               Coburn’s relationship with his daughters further soured after he and Holly were\n\nmarried in July 2011. At that time, Coburn and Holly were anxious to blend their two families,\n\nwhich included Holly’s three children from a previous marriage. To that end, Coburn attempted to\n\nexercise his long-distance standard-possession rights in Houston, but the girls, who where\n\nincreasingly exhibiting signs of emotional distress and anxiety, resisted visitation by crying, getting\n\nphysically ill, refusing to get out of the car, and running away and hiding. The issues the children\n\nwere experiencing included distress over being so quickly integrated into a new family situation and\n\ndiscomfort at missing events and activities in Austin that were important to them during their\n\nfather’s periods of visitation. The relationship between Coburn and Moreland had also become\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fhighly conflicted, and the parties dispute whether and to what extent the conflict resulted from or\n\ncaused the situation between Coburn and their daughters.\n\n                Due to frequent disagreements about the nature, extent, and location of Coburn’s\n\nvisitation with the girls, a number of efforts ensued to ameliorate the discord and address the\n\ntransition issues the children were experiencing. Temporary orders were issued concerning Coburn’s\n\nsummer visitation, and a parenting facilitator was appointed to assist in visitation transitions, dispute\n\nresolution, and communications between Moreland and Coburn.\n\n                The parties also engaged the assistance of therapeutic professionals to address the\n\nissues of familial conflict. Dr. Allison Wilcox became the girls’ individual therapist. Family\n\ncounseling was also secured, first from Dr. Susan McMillan and then from Dr. Carlos Loredo.4 In\n\naddition to engaging the services of these therapists, Moreland started attending a divorce support\n\ngroup and participating in individual therapy. Coburn did not retain an individual therapist but did\n\nbegin attending family therapy sessions.\n\n                In therapy, the family worked to address a number of consistent behavior patterns that\n\nwere identified as having aggravated tensions, including that (1) Coburn minimized or failed to\n\nappreciate how his daughters were impacted by the significant and sudden changes in their lives,\n\ncreating the impression that he was disinterested in their feelings; (2) Coburn disregarded or\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          In an agreed order, the trial court appointed Dr. Loredo to (1) provide family therapy for\nthe parents and the children, (2) make recommendations to the parents as to the parents’ interactions\nwith the children, (3) assist the children and their parents in reducing conflict and in facilitating the\nrelationship and visitation between Coburn and the children, and (4) make recommendations\nconcerning visitation, access, and communication between Coburn and the children.\n\n                                                   6\n\funderestimated the girls’ need to spend “alone time” with him during visitation;5 (3) Coburn resisted\n\nthe therapists’ recommendations to gradually transition the children into their new, blended family;6\n\n(4) the children perceived Coburn as being insensitive to their desire to participate in activities and\n\nevents they had been participating in for several years before their parents divorced, including events\n\nthat were important to them that they would miss if visitation occurred every other weekend in\n\nHouston;7 (5) Moreland had emotional and angry outbursts towards Coburn and Holly in front of the\n\n\n        5\n         The girls told their therapist, Dr. Wilcox, that they “wanted to spend time alone with their\nfather” but that “when they went to Houston with their dad they very rarely spent much time alone\nwith him.”\n        6\n           Dr. Wilcox and the family therapist, Dr. Loredo, both testified they informed Coburn that\nit would be therapeutically beneficial for him to spend alone time with the girls and gradually\ntransition them into a blended family. Coburn and Holly, however, did not agree with the therapists’\nrecommendations and instead believed that the best course of action was to force the girls to go on\nvisits with their father and spend time as a blended family. Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo testified that\nCoburn resisted their recommendations to employ a “step-wise” progression that included time spent\nalone with the girls. They gave as an example a circumstance in October 2011 when Coburn made\nplans to spend the weekend with his daughters at a hotel in Austin. Coburn admitted to knowing that\nthe girls believed that they would be spending time alone with their father. Coburn, however, said\nhe never actually “agreed” to spend the weekend alone with the girls so he did not turn Holly and\nher children away when they “surprised” him and the girls by showing up at the hotel. Dr. Wilcox\nreported to the court that, after the incident, the girls were “visibly distraught and upset at what they\nperceive[d] to be their father’s deliberate deception.” At the time of trial, Coburn and Holly\ncontinued to maintain that the therapists’ recommendations were wrong.\n        7\n           The girls’ activities included swim team, dance, and gymnastics. Issues arose when the\ngirls would have a competition or recital that conflicted with Coburn’s visitation periods. Although\nCoburn complained that Moreland signed the children up for these activities without his consent, the\nrecord shows that the girls had been engaged in these activities for years, and although the dates of\nevents changed from year to year, those events were scheduled by third parties, not Moreland.\nCoburn testified that he tried to be flexible with visitation times to accommodate some of the\nactivities, and the record reflects that the girls were ultimately able to attend most of their activities\nas a result. The primary source of tension appears to have been Coburn’s inability or unwillingness\nto decide in advance whether the girls would be able to attend scheduled events and activities. This\nresulted in the girls’ feeling anxious and emotional about whether they would actually be able to\nattend. Coburn asserted that he did not have enough notice of the girls’ events to make informed\ndecisions about how the rest of the family would be burdened by accommodating an individual’s\n\n                                                    7\n\fchildren on occasion, and the children felt very protective of her;8 (6) Coburn had said insensitive\n\nand hurtful things about Moreland to the children on occasion;9 (7) Coburn had not followed through\n\nwith promises to the girls or denied having made promises to them, which caused them to distrust\n\nhim;10 and (8) Coburn felt that Moreland encouraged the children to be disrespectful to him and to\n\n\nactivities. Moreland stated that event schedules for at least some activities were available on\ncalendars accessible to Coburn via the Internet.\n       8\n          Moreland admits to having become overly emotional and angry in front of the children on\nseveral occasions before she started participating in individual therapy and her divorce support\ngroup. Among other things, she admitted to (1) crying and telling the girls that their father was\nleaving all of them when he asked her for a divorce, which allegedly prompted E.C. to yell “Daddy,\nI hate you, I hate you”; (2) putting the L sign to her forehead with her fingers to insinuate that\nCoburn was a “loser” during a temporary-orders hearing; (3) throwing bills into Coburn’s car, telling\nHolly “here, pay these bills, these are for you,” saying “F-U, Kirk. Go to hell,” and referring to\nCoburn and Holly as “losers” at one visitation exchange during which both parties called the police;\n(4) telling Coburn that he had “some balls” for showing up at the girls’ swim competition and\nreferring to him as “Mr. Toussaint” (Holly’s former surname); (5) stating that Holly did not love E.C.\nand barely knew her when Holly professed to love E.C. at a gymnastics event; and (6) not telling\nCoburn or school officials that the girls planned to hide from him when he was coming to pick them\nup at school for visitation, which created a serious issue at the school. Moreland also admitted to\nmaking a number of derogatory comments to Coburn and Holly that were not in the children’s\npresence, but which caused Coburn to believe that similar statements were being made about them\nto the children. Further, although neither admitted nor denied by Moreland, Coburn and Holly\nreported that Moreland (1) had to be physically restrained in front of the children on two occasions,\n(2) had referred to Holly as being “as psychotic as [Coburn]” in front of E.C., (3) had referred to\nthem as “a joke” during the incident at school, (4) had “body checked” Holly at a gymnastics event,\nand (5) had hit Coburn on “quite a few occasions.” It appears to be undisputed, however, that neither\nthese nor similar incidents had occurred in the six months preceding the modification trial. It is\nlikewise undisputed that Coburn never responded in kind.\n       9\n          Coburn admitted that he told the children that Holly was his soul-mate, it was a mistake\nto have married Moreland, God approved of the divorce because he and Moreland did not have a\ncovenant before God, and God approved of his marriage to Holly because they do have a covenant.\nCoburn testified that, to some extent, it was important for the children to know this information and\nthat it would help foster a better relationship between him and his children.\n       10\n           In addition to the incident at the hotel, another example of Coburn’s allegedly reneging\non a deal the girls believed he had made occurred in November 2011. During a meeting, Dr. Wilcox\nand the girls understood that Coburn was offering to trade weekends so that the girls could spend\n\n                                                  8\n\fresist their visitations with him.11 Moreland admittedly did not respond well when she was upset,\n\nespecially in situations she believed were causing her children distress, but she sought therapy to\n\naddress that behavior and took responsibility for her actions.\n\n                Although Coburn denied contributing to his children’s distress, he nevertheless agreed\n\nto a court order that required the parties “to cooperate with Dr. Loredo and to follow Dr. Loredo’s\n\nrecommendations concerning the children, as to visitation, access, content, and the behavior of the\n\nparent toward the child.” As a result of this agreement, Coburn had limited visitation with the girls\n\nfor about six months before trial and mostly interacted with the girls in thrice-weekly Skype sessions\n\nand periodic therapy sessions. During this time period, Coburn also voluntarily agreed to increase\n\n\nThanksgiving with family members in Austin. Dr. Wilcox said the girls were excited about the\nopportunity when they left the session. The following day, however, Dr. Wilcox said Coburn\nexchanged a series of emails with her in which he “completely disavowed everything that happened\nin the session the previous day,” including his agreement to trade weekends. According to\nDr. Wilcox, Coburn “consistently placed the girls in a position in which they begin to second-guess\ntheir own thoughts. When they are unable to rationalize what their father has done[,] they begin to\nbecome angry and disillusioned with [him].”\n       11\n           Coburn complained that Moreland did not consistently reprimand the children for speaking\ndisrespectfully or inappropriately to or about him, but it was disputed whether and to what extent the\nchildren were being “disrespectful” versus appropriately expressing their feelings. The therapists\nwho testified at trial said that the children needed to be able to express their feelings to their father\nand that it was debatable as to where some of the interactions fell on the spectrum between\ncommunication of feelings and disrespect. Coburn further testified that, on occasion, the children\ncriticized him using language he believes they had heard from their mother.\n         Coburn asserted that Moreland had interfered with his relationship with the girls from the\noutset of their separation. He testified that he was asked not to take possession of the girls for a\nwhile because Moreland and his daughters were having difficulty with the divorce. Then, when he\ndid begin taking possession, he said that Moreland complained that the girls were scared to visit him\nat his new home in Austin and that she consistently interrupted his periods of possession because she\nwould pick up the girls on their request. There is also evidence that Moreland suggested to the girls\nthat they would not have to go on visits with their father if they were unwilling or if he was more\nthan 15 minutes late to pick them up. The parties further dispute the extent of Moreland’s role in the\nchildren’s plan to hide at school to avoid a scheduled visitation with their father. Finally, Moreland\nadmitted to having expressed to Coburn that she wanted him out of the girls’ lives permanently.\n\n                                                   9\n\fhis child-support payment to the statutory guideline maximum of $1,875 per month while the\n\nmodification suit was pending. See Tex. Fam. Code § 154.125 (guidelines for determining\n\npresumptive child-support obligation).\n\n               Moreland and Coburn also agreed to submit to psychological evaluations, and the trial\n\ncourt appointed Dr. Alissa Sherry to perform those evaluations.12 After completing the evaluations,\n\nDr. Sherry diagnosed Coburn with “narcissistic personality disorder” with “sociopathic traits.”\n\nDr. Sherry found that Coburn “places his own needs over the needs of the children” and is “willing\n\nto forgo the girls’ events in favor of his own needs and has [also] exercised serious lapses in\n\njudgment in his communication[s] with other mental health professionals trying to assist the family.”\n\nDr. Sherry concluded that Coburn “is not likely to take responsibility for his actions and instead\n\ntends to blame and project his shortcomings on to [sic] others.” As a result, she determined that “the\n\nlikelihood of [Coburn’s] ability to engage in effective co-parenting is seriously limited as is his\n\nability to place the needs of others ahead of himself.” She further found that Coburn had engaged\n\nin “gaslighting behavior,” which she defined as “manipulative behavior used to confuse people into\n\nquestioning their reactions to events, so much so that the victims of gaslighting begin to question\n\ntheir own sanity.” She observed that gaslighting is often referred to as “‘crazy-making’ as it makes\n\notherwise ordinary functioning individuals act ‘crazy’ in the face of such discrepant pieces\n\nof information.”\n\n               In comparison, Dr. Sherry determined that Moreland did not meet the criteria for any\n\npersonality disorder. She also concluded that Moreland’s actions did not meet the threshold for\n\n\n       12\n          As with the other therapeutic professionals, Dr. Sherry was recommended by either\nCoburn or his attorneys.\n\n                                                 10\n\fparental alienating behaviors. She further opined that “when [Moreland’s] behavior has become\n\nunrestrained, it is the result of behaviors that are insensitive, narcissistic, or baiting on the part of Mr.\n\nCoburn.” Also, in contrast to Coburn, Dr. Sherry found that Moreland was “interpersonally inclined\n\ntowards cooperative, mutually satisfying relationships.” Dr. Sherry concluded that Moreland’s\n\n“healthy reality testing, likelihood of engaging in cooperative relationships, and affective stability\n\nbode well for both healthy parenting and the ability to co-parent with others. However, because of\n\nMr. Coburn’s existing psychopathology, the likelihood of this parent dyad to co-parent with each\n\nother is tentative at best.”\n\n                In April 2012, about two months before trial, Moreland expanded her modification\n\npetition to include a request to be granted exclusive rights and duties with respect to several aspects\n\nof the children’s lives. Moreland also sought significant modifications to Coburn’s possessory rights\n\nand requested that the trial court order Coburn to (1) exercise all of his periods of possession in\n\nTravis County; (2) take the children to all of their extracurricular activities and events during his\n\nperiods of possession; (3) engage in individual counseling in order to have possession of and access\n\nto the children; (4) submit to supervised visitation, as recommended by the children’s therapists;\n\n(5) pay for the children’s therapy; and (6) Skype with the children only if recommended by the\n\nchildren’s therapists.\n\n                In response, Coburn filed a counter-petition requesting appointment as the children’s\n\nsole managing conservator or, in the alternative, joint managing conservator with the exclusive right\n\nto make certain decisions regarding the children, including the right to designate their primary\n\nresidence. According to Coburn and Holly, Moreland’s interference was the driving factor in the\n\n\n\n                                                     11\n\fproblems the girls were experiencing with their father. As a result, Coburn sought sole custody as\n\na means of forming a positive relationship with his children and successfully blending his families.\n\nAt that time, however, Coburn had not had weekend possession of the girls in several months\n\nbecause he had not complied with Dr. Loredo’s therapeutic recommendations and because his\n\nestrangement from his daughters was intensifying.13 Dr. Sherry observed that Coburn’s request for\n\nimmediate sole custody, given the status of his relationship with the children—and contrary to the\n\ntherapists’ recommendations—was consistent with a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder,\n\nbut she acknowledged that it could also have reflected the advice of legal counsel.\n\n               At trial, Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo testified that even with professional intervention\n\nand regular Skype communications, the girls’ emotional state and estrangement from their father had\n\ngotten worse. According to the therapists, significant reasons for the lack of improvement included\n\n(1) Coburn’s unwillingness to follow their therapeutic recommendations, including spending alone\n\ntime with the girls and employing a “step-wise” progression of visitation with the blended family\n\nin Houston; (2) his professed inability to regularly attend therapy sessions with Dr. Loredo due to\n\nhis work schedule during the week; and (3) his disturbing interactions with the children in recorded\n\nSkype sessions, in which he appeared indifferent and unsympathetic to their emotional distress and\n\nflaunted the lavish lifestyle he was living. Both Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo also testified that they\n\nhad observed interpersonal conduct by Coburn that was consistent with Dr. Sherry’s diagnosis of\n\n\n       13\n           The court order appointing Dr. Loredo provided a method of recourse if a party objected\nto the doctor’s recommendations or did not wish to follow those recommendations. Under the\ncourt’s order, an objecting party was required to give written notice to Dr. Loredo and the other\nparties of “the intention not to abide by Dr. Loredo’s recommendations” and had the duty to bring\nthe matter to the trial court’s attention. There is no indication in the record that Coburn followed\nthis procedure.\n\n                                                12\n\fnarcissistic personality disorder with sociopathic traits. Dr. Loredo further declared that there were\n\nvideo recordings of instances in which Coburn had engaged in “gaslighting behavior” with the\n\nchildren, which he characterized as “a type of psychological abuse.” Dr. Wilcox opined that both\n\ngirls were suffering from “systemic emotional abuse” and that Coburn was the parent primarily\n\nresponsible for the emotional abuse they had endured. She observed that, although the girls were\n\nangry at both their mother and father, they had enjoyed alone time with their mother to work through\n\ntheir feelings, but their father would not spend alone time with them, even at the therapists’ behest.\n\n                Dr. Wilcox also agreed with Dr. Sherry’s conclusion that Moreland had not alienated\n\nthe girls from their father and, instead, had helped facilitate the girls’ spending time with him.\n\nDr. Loredo further testified that Moreland had been helpful in getting the girls to participate in\n\ntherapy sessions with their father when they were resisting. Both therapists acknowledged, however,\n\nthat Moreland had behaved inappropriately in front of the children in ways that were neither proper\n\nnor helpful, and Dr. Wilcox testified that Moreland’s “screaming at [Coburn] in front of the school\n\n[during one visitation exchange] is probably emotionally abusive.” They noted, however, that\n\nMoreland had accepted responsibility for her behavior, undertaken measures to rectify it, and had\n\nnot—to their knowledge—engaged in similar conduct in the six-month period preceding trial.\n\n                Both Dr. Wilcox and Dr. Loredo opined that it would be inadvisable to force the girls\n\nto go on visits with their father given the state of their relationship at that time. They explained that\n\nforced visitation would probably make the situation worse and would be detrimental to the girls.\n\nBoth therapists also recommended to the court that the children not be required to visit with their\n\nfather unless a third party, preferably a therapist, was present as they employed a step-wise transition\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n\finto long-distance standard possession with Coburn and the blended family. Dr. Loredo also testified\n\nthat Coburn needed individual counseling with a therapist who would communicate with the other\n\ntherapists and not just rely on Coburn’s version of events. According to Dr. Loredo, a family\n\ndynamic that includes a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder is among the most difficult to\n\nwork with and has the potential to be very destructive in a family system. He stated, however, that\n\nhe believed therapy would be beneficial because Coburn and the children truly love each other and\n\nwant a healthy relationship.\n\n               Dr. Sherry concurred that therapeutic intervention was necessary to address Coburn’s\n\nmanipulative behavior, which she testified is destructive to a relationship between parent and child.\n\nShe asserted that it was important for Coburn to understand that he needs to make changes. As a\n\nresult, she observed that he would need to work with a therapist who would challenge his perspective\n\nand not simply mirror his world view. Dr. Sherry further testified that it would be detrimental to\n\nforce the girls to “hurry up” into a blended family until some time had been spent “acknowledging\n\nand repairing the damage that’s been done and easing the kids into a relationship with that\n\nacknowledgment . . . .” With respect to the children’s activities, she stated that there needed to be\n\nmore proactive management of the children’s expectations regarding attendance. Specifically, she\n\nsaid, in order to reduce the children’s anxiety, there needed to be a plan for the children to\n\nunderstand in advance what they can attend, who will be attending with them, and what they will\n\nhave to miss. She opined that an authoritative approach that did not take into consideration the\n\nchildren’s desires and feelings would be ineffective and would enhance conflict with the children,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fwho are at or approaching a developmental stage where their individual identities are becoming\n\nimportant to them.\n\n               With regard to shared parenting rights, Dr. Sherry testified that it was possible for\n\nCoburn to effectively co-parent if circumstances were structured in a way that benefitted him, but\n\nshe stated that “he’s going to have some problems anytime he gets a response from others, whether\n\nit’s the girls or Ms. Moreland, that he doesn’t want or that doesn’t fit his view of himself. But the\n\nmore it can be structured in a way . . . that he has something to gain by it, probably the better.” She\n\nfurther recommended that Moreland and Coburn have no contact with each other and that one parent\n\nbe granted the exclusive right to make decisions regarding the children to minimize their\n\ninteractions. She observed that Moreland is the “predominant parent” and that there are a number\n\nof psychological issues with Coburn that interfere with his ability to respond appropriately to the\n\nchildren’s emotional needs.\n\n               At the time of trial, Coburn testified that he had met with an individual therapist for\n\none hour on one occasion, but little was known about the therapist’s qualifications. Although\n\nCoburn was not committed to the idea that he needed to participate in therapy, he professed a\n\nwillingness to do so. Ultimately, both Coburn and Holly testified that they did not agree with\n\nDr. Sherry’s diagnosis and did not agree with salient aspects of Dr. Wilcox’s and Dr. Loredo’s\n\ntherapeutic recommendations. Coburn testified that it would be in the girls’ best interests if he were\n\nawarded primary possession, or in the alternative, standard possession that was not conditioned on\n\ntherapeutic participation or the recommendation of any therapists as to the frequency and duration\n\nof appropriate visitation. Although Coburn conceded that his decisions to divorce Moreland, move\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fto Houston, and introduce a new family into the girls’ lives had been difficult for them, he\n\nmaintained that Moreland was primarily responsible for the problems between him and the girls and\n\nhad exacerbated the situation. Meanwhile, Holly testified that Moreland was “95 percent” of the\n\ncause of the estrangement between Coburn and his daughters and was the sole impediment to\n\nimproving the situation. She asserted that the solution to the problem was for Coburn to be more\n\nauthoritative in enforcing visitation with the girls. Dr. Loredo testified that Holly’s opinion reflected\n\na “simplistic solution” to a complicated situation and showed a “lack of insight.”\n\n                With regard to the child-support issue, Coburn testified that he was presently\n\nself-employed as a venture capitalist. He admitted that he considered himself to have a job, but did\n\nnot currently make any money due to the compensation structure of his business, which he said is\n\nstandard in the industry. He agreed that “the decision not to take a [paying] job is a voluntary one”\n\non his part and stated that his wife’s financial support is helping him do so. He testified that he is\n\n“voluntarily . . . not seeking or accepting employment” and would not do so for the foreseeable\n\nfuture because “it’s not about the money.” He testified that, if he obtained gainful employment, he\n\ncould reasonably expect to earn between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Although Moreland’s\n\ncounsel sought to introduce evidence about Holly’s financial resources, the trial court concluded that\n\nthe proffered evidence was irrelevant to the child-support issue before the court. See Tex. Fam.\n\nCode § 156.404 (“The court may not add any portion of the net resources of a new spouse to the net\n\nresources of an obligor or obligee in order to calculate the amount of child support to be ordered in\n\na suit for modification.”); see also id. § 154.069 (“The court may not add any portion of the net\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fresources of a spouse to the net resources of an obligor or obligee in order to calculate the amount\n\nof child support ordered.”).\n\n               After hearing the foregoing evidence, the trial court observed that all three expert\n\nwitnesses recommended something other than granting Coburn primary possession or immediate\n\nstandard possession. Accordingly, the court entered an order denying Coburn’s modification request\n\nin its entirety and directing Coburn to participate in 25 weeks of individual therapy with his chosen\n\ntherapist and 25 weeks of family therapy with Dr. Loredo before resuming standard possession. The\n\ntrial court also required Coburn to execute a release allowing the therapists to share information with\n\none another and with Dr. Wilcox. During the 25-week period, Coburn was entitled to supervised\n\nvisitation with the girls for 1.5 hours each week and could Skype with the girls in a frequency and\n\nmanner directed by Dr. Loredo. The trial court further denied Coburn extended possession of the\n\ngirls for 42 consecutive days in the summer of 2012, as he had requested under his standard\n\npossession rights. The trial court’s order further awarded Coburn standard possession upon\n\ncompletion of the required counseling. Moreland, however, was awarded the exclusive right to make\n\ndecisions concerning the children’s education and to consent to non-invasive medical and dental\n\nprocedures and psychiatric and psychological treatment of the children.\n\n               With respect to child support, the court found that Coburn had admitted to intentional\n\nunderemployment and his ability to make a six-figure income. The court determined that Coburn\n\nhas the ability to make $200,000 per year and that his monthly net resources are $12,736.11. The\n\ncourt also found the children’s proven support needs to be $3,557.50 per month.14 Based on these\n\n\n       14\n          At trial, Moreland introduced evidence concerning the actual expenses incurred to support\nthe children. The court determined that some of the expenses could be segregated between Moreland\n\n                                                  17\n\fdeterminations, the court concluded that the statutory guideline child-support payment was $1,875\n\nand that Coburn was responsible for paying 50% of the children’s proven needs above the guideline\n\namount, resulting in a child-support obligation of $2,716.25. See id. §§ 154.125 (presumptive\n\npercentage guidelines applicable to obligor’s net resources), .126 (court order for additional\n\nchild-support amounts based on parents’ income and child’s proven needs); see also id. § 156.402\n\n(effect of child-support guidelines in modification proceeding). The court also awarded Moreland\n\n$165,366.65 in attorney’s fees, which is approximately 80% of the attorney’s fees Coburn stipulated\n\nto be reasonable and necessary. See id. § 106.002(a) (vesting trial court with discretion to award\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees in SAPCR proceeding). In addition to the final order modifying the\n\nagreed divorce decree, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the\n\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n               In four issues on appeal, Coburn asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n(1) deviating from the standard possession order and conditioning possession and access on\n\nhis participation in 25 weeks of court-ordered counseling, (2) granting Moreland exclusive\n\ndecision-making rights concerning the children’s education and health care, (3) determining that a\n\nchange in circumstances warranted modification and increasing his child-support obligation based\n\n\n\n\nand the children, while other expenses were not readily divisible between them. As for the\nnon-divisible expenses—mortgage, household, groceries, meals away from home, transportation, and\nincidentals—the court attributed one-third of some expenses and one-half of other expenses to the\nchildren. Expenses attributable solely to the children—including school lunches and life\ninsurance—were fully credited to the children’s support needs. The court disregarded expenses that\ncould have been segregated but were not, including medical and mental-health care, clothing,\nand shoes.\n\n                                                18\n\fon a finding that he was voluntarily underemployed, and (4) requiring him to pay any of Moreland’s\n\nattorney’s fees and court costs related to the modification proceeding.15\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n                The issues presented in this appeal are subject to review for clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

The therapists who testified at trial were generally in agreement that it\n\nwas possible for therapy and a step-wise integration of the children into their new blended family\n\nto help remediate the alienation between Coburn and his children and help the children heal\n\nemotionally. If these measures were beneficial in rectifying the problems between Coburn and his\n\ndaughters, it would not be reasonable to expect the trial court to have an occasion to impose similar\n\nrestrictions in the future. Correspondingly, if therapy was not effective, it would not be reasonable\n\nto expect the trial court to continue to pursue a course of action that had proven fruitless. Although\n\nit is certainly possible that the same or similar restrictions could be imposed in the future, there is\n\n\n        17\n           In light of this determination, we need not consider Moreland’s alternative argument that\nthe “capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review” exception does not apply in this case because it only\napplies to unconstitutional acts performed by the government.

He further contends there is no evidence that he and Moreland were in actual conflict\n\nregarding the children’s education and non-invasive health-care decisions or that he was apathetic\n\nabout or neglectful of these matters. Accordingly, he contends there is no evidence to support the\n\ntrial court’s determination that limiting his parental rights is in the children’s best interests.\n\n                When parents are named joint managing conservators, the trial court must allocate\n\nparental rights and duties to be exercised independently, jointly, or exclusively. Tex. Fam. Code\n\n§ 153.071 (court required to specify rights and duties of parent appointed conservator); .072 (court\n\nmay limit rights and duties if written finding that limitation is in child’s best interest), .134(b)(2),\n\n(4) (rights and duties in court-ordered joint conservatorship); see also id. § 151.001 (parental rights\n\n\n        18\n           The trial court also awarded Moreland the exclusive right to consent to psychiatric and\npsychological treatment of the children, but Coburn does not appear to challenge this portion of the\ncourt’s judgment.\n\n                                                   25\n\fand duties). Parents can be appointed joint managing conservators even if the exclusive right to\n\nmake certain decisions is awarded to only one parent. See id. § 101.016 (defining “joint managing\n\nconservatorship” to mean “the sharing of the rights and duties of a parent by two parties, ordinarily\n\nthe parents, even if the exclusive right to make certain decisions may be awarded to one party”).\n\n               In the agreed divorce decree between Coburn and Moreland, the parties were granted\n\nthe joint right to make educational decisions and to consent to non-invasive medical and dental\n\nprocedures on behalf of their daughters. The Family Code provides that the court may modify a prior\n\norder (1) if doing so would be in the child’s best interest and (2) if the child’s or parties’\n\ncircumstances have “materially and substantially changed” since the order was rendered. Id.\n\n§ 156.101(a)(1). The party seeking modification has the burden to establish these elements by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. See Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 589 (addressing modification\n\nof conservatorship).\n\n               As to the first element, there is no bright-line rule for determining what is in a\n\nchild’s best interest; each case must be determined on its unique set of facts. See Lenz v. Lenz,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747741/lenz-v-lenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (Tex. 2002). In this case, it is fairly indisputable that Moreland and Coburn have\n\nbeen unable to co-parent amicably. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that they have not been\n\nable to communicate with one another without escalating conflict, and as a result, they have largely\n\nwithdrawn from communicating with each other. While Coburn blames Moreland for the conflict\n\nand lack of communication, there is ample evidence that Coburn contributed to or incited the\n\nconflict; there is also some evidence that for some period of time and to some extent he voluntarily\n\nceded to Holly his responsibility to communicate with Moreland and the girls’ therapists. The record\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\falso contains evidence that Coburn has challenged Moreland’s authority under the agreed divorce\n\ndecree to make regular medical and dental appointments for the girls and to re-enroll them in their\n\nextracurricular activities without his consent. The tensions between Coburn and Moreland also\n\nresulted in Moreland’s failing to effectively communicate with Coburn about an issue with P.C.’s\n\nreading ability.\n\n                Dr. Sherry testified that one of the parents should be given the exclusive right to make\n\nsignificant decisions regarding the children because Coburn and Moreland cannot effectively\n\nco-parent. Although Dr. Sherry did not recommend one parent over the other, she observed that\n\nMoreland is the “predominant” parent. The record supports this observation with undisputed\n\nevidence that Moreland has always been the primary caretaker for the children and principally\n\nresponsible for taking them to school, extracurricular activities, and medical appointments. In\n\ncontrast, Dr. Sherry testified that Coburn has a number of psychological issues that interfere with\n\nhis ability to respond appropriately to the children’s emotional needs. Dr. Sherry’s psychological\n\nevaluation of Moreland and Coburn was also introduced into evidence. In that report, Dr. Sherry\n\nfound that Moreland was likely to engage in cooperative relationships, which she said “bode[s] well\n\nfor both healthy parenting and the ability to co-parent with others.” She noted, however, that it was\n\nunlikely that Moreland could effectively co-parent with Coburn due to his “existing\n\npsychopathology.” Of particular note, Dr. Sherry concluded that “the likelihood of [Coburn’s]\n\nability to engage in effective co-parenting is seriously limited as is his ability to place the needs of\n\nothers ahead of himself.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f               Whatever the cause or blame for the conflict, there is ample evidence that Moreland\n\nand Coburn cannot effectively co-parent. The trial court was therefore justified in selecting one\n\nparent as exclusive decision-maker to avoid conflict. Rather than taking a kitchen-sink approach,\n\nthe trial court made a reasoned analysis in determining which decisions should be exercised\n\nexclusively by one parent because they are likely to arise more frequently than other matters over\n\nwhich the parties retain joint decision-making authority. At the conclusion of the trial, the court\n\nexplained that the high-conflict nature of the case warranted the assignment of exclusive\n\ndecision-making rights for education and health care to provide a measure of stability for these\n\nimportant decisions and to avoid the parties’ “coming back to court every time a decision needs to\n\nbe made.”    Moreover, there have been actual conflicts and lapses regarding the children’s\n\neducational needs and participation in extracurricular activities due to the dynamic between\n\nMoreland and Coburn. Furthermore, Moreland is and has been the primary parent, and she retains\n\nprimary possession of the children, which makes the trial court’s assignment of those rights to her\n\nlogical. Finally, there is evidence that Coburn’s ability to place his children’s needs before his own\n\nis impaired. See Garza v.

App.—Fort Worth 2013,\n\nno pet.).\n\n                In sum, Coburn has not shown that the trial court acted in an unreasonable and\n\narbitrary manner or without reference to guiding principles when it found that it was in E.C.’s and\n\nP.C.’s best interests for Moreland to be awarded the exclusive right to make educational and\n\nnon-invasive health-care decisions. We overrule Coburn’s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n        19\n           Coburn argues that there must be sufficient evidence of parental conflict, apathy, or\nneglect with regard to the specific parental rights that have been limited. While the parties have cited\na number of cases in which such circumstances have existed and were noted, Coburn has cited no\nauthority—nor have we found any—suggesting that the trial court’s discretion is so limited.\n\n                                                  29\n\f       Child Support\n\n               In his third appellate issue, Coburn challenges the trial court’s award of increased\n\nchild support.20 Coburn contends the trial court abused its discretion by (1) modifying his\n\nchild-support obligation based on a finding that he is voluntarily underemployed; (2) erroneously\n\ncalculating the “proven needs” of the children; (3) failing to provide specific reasons for imposing\n\nchild support in excess of the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 of the Family Code; and\n\n(4) considering his interim voluntary support payments in modifying his support obligation.\n\n               A trial court has the authority to modify a child-support obligation if “the\n\ncircumstances of the child or a person affected by the order have materially and substantially\n\nchanged” since the rendition of the prior order of child support.             See Tex. Fam. Code\n\n§ 156.401(a)(1). The absence of a material and substantial change is a theme that underlies the core\n\nchild-support dispute in this case. Because this matter logically precedes the specific allegations of\n\nerror, we begin our analysis by considering whether modification of the child-support terms in the\n\nagreed divorce decree was warranted by sufficient evidence of a material and substantial change in\n\ncircumstances. The party seeking modification has the burden to establish these elements by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. See Zeifman, 212 S.W.3d at 589 (addressing modification of\n\nconservatorship).\n\n               In contesting the trial court’s finding of voluntary underemployment, Coburn asserts\n\nthat neither his income nor his “earning potential” changed following the divorce. He contends that\n\n\n\n       20\n           Coburn’s briefing lacks clarity regarding exactly what he contends his child-support\nobligation should be, but his position on that matter is ultimately immaterial in light of our\ndisposition of this appellate issue.\n\n                                                 30\n\fthe only material changes of circumstance were that he became romantically involved with a wealthy\n\nwoman whose generosity and support have enabled him to pursue a business venture that currently\n\npays him no income but has the potential for being very lucrative. As Coburn points out, the\n\nresources of a new spouse are not relevant to determining the net resources of a child-support\n\nobligor, see Tex. Fam. Code § 156.404, and the trial court correctly refused to consider such\n\nevidence. Independent of Holly’s financial resources, however, there is sufficient evidence from\n\nwhich the trial court could have properly concluded that Coburn’s circumstances changed in that he\n\nwas not voluntarily unemployed or underemployed when the divorce decree was executed but\n\nbecame so when he began pursuing his new venture-capital business.\n\n                In the agreed divorce decree, the parties acknowledged that Coburn was unemployed,\n\nand his child-support obligation was set taking that circumstance into consideration. However, the\n\ndecree also reflects—with bolding and underlining for emphasis—that the parties anticipated that\n\nCoburn would be seeking employment more commensurate with his earning potential and expressly\n\ncontemplated recalculation of his child-support obligation on the happening of that event.21\n\nConsistent with the expectations embodied in the agreed divorce decree, Coburn had actually\n\n\n       21\n            The agreed divorce decree provides:\n\n              For the period of time while KIRK BRAND COBURN is unemployed, IT IS\n       ORDERED that KIRK BRAND COBURN is obligated to pay and shall pay to\n       JANET MORELAND COBURN child support for two (2) children in the amount of\n       $600.00 per month . . . .\n\n       ....\n\n              FURTHER, IT IS ORDERED that as soon as KIRK BRAND COBURN\n       gains employment, his monthly child support obligation will be recalculated\n       pursuant to the guidelines as set forth in the Texas Family Code.\n\n                                                  31\n\fcommunicated to Moreland, either before or contemporaneously with the execution of the agreed\n\ndivorce decree, that he was interviewing for a job in Houston. The changed circumstances that are\n\nrelevant to this case do not involve Coburn’s actual income or earning potential; the evidence reflects\n\nthat those circumstances have remained substantially the same since rendition of the agreed divorce\n\ndecree. What has changed is that Coburn has voluntarily ceased efforts to find employment that\n\nwould provide an income sufficient to support his children. Evidence of the change from involuntary\n\nunemployment on the date of the agreed divorce decree to voluntary underemployment thereafter is\n\nsufficient to support the trial court’s finding of a material and substantial change of circumstances.\n\nSee, e.g., Baucom v. Crews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1664064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1664064/baucom-v-crews/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (Tex.

He asserts that, in the\n\npresent case, his eventual acknowledgment of being voluntarily underemployed falls outside the\n\nshort 41-day time frame between those events.

Coburn construes\n\nthe phrase “the time when modification is sought” as referring exclusively to the date the\n\nmodification petition was filed, and as a result, he appears to be asserting that the trial court cannot\n\nconsider evidence arising after that date.\n\n                The relevant time frame was not at issue in the cases using the “time when\n\nmodification is sought” language. We cannot find a single case in which the ending date of the\n\ncomparative time frame was a substantive issue, let alone one expressly limiting evidence to the\n\ncircumstances existing on the day the modification suit was filed. Rather, when discussing the\n\nevidentiary comparison that is required, many cases have stated that there must be evidence of the\n\nrelevant party’s “current” circumstances, not circumstances at the time the modification petition was\n\nfiled.

Civ. App.—Eastland 1979, no writ) (relevant time\n\nperiod for determining material and substantial change is date of original decree and time of\n\nmodification hearing). By and large, the cases Coburn cites do not fairly elucidate what is intended\n\nby the phrase “the time when modification is sought,” do not tie that particular language to the\n\nstatutory language, and above all, do not hold that the filing date of the modification petition is an\n\nevidentiary or claim cut-off date. In short, these cases are not instructive with respect to the\n\nargument Coburn appears to be making. Most importantly, we believe that imposing the cut-off date\n\nCoburn suggests would be inconsistent with section 156.401 and the Family Code as a whole.\n\n                Section 156.401 authorizes the trial court to modify a child-support order in the event\n\nof changed circumstances “since . . . the date of the order’s rendition” (or on the happening of other\n\nevents not relevant here). Tex. Fam. Code § 156.401(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Pertinent to the\n\ncircumstances presented in this case, the starting date prescribed by the statute is the date of the order\n\nthat is being modified, and the end date is, logically, when the trial court actually modifies the\n\nsupport order. Id. (“[T]he court may modify an order that provides for the support of a child . . . [if]\n\n\n\n                                                   34\n\fthe circumstances . . . have materially and substantially changed since . . . the date of the order’s\n\nrendition . . . .”). Nothing in section 156.401 limits the scope of relevant evidence to the\n\ncircumstances in effect on the date a modification petition is filed, nor is any such limitation found\n\nelsewhere in Chapter 156.\n\n                Moreover, treating the petition date as an evidentiary cut-off date would be\n\ninconsistent with the unique statutory scheme applicable to SAPCR proceedings. In a typical civil\n\ncase, the date the petition is filed can implicate significant issues like a statute of limitations and the\n\ntrial court’s jurisdiction. In SAPCR proceedings, however, the trial court retains continuing,\n\nexclusive jurisdiction to modify a prior final order. Id. § 155.001. The only temporal limitation on\n\nthe court’s authority to modify a support order is that circumstances have changed materially and\n\nsubstantially since the prior order, and the only limitation on a party’s ability to file a modification\n\nsuit is that the request be in good faith and not for the purpose of harassment. See id. §§ 156.005,\n\n.401. Given these circumstances, it would be pointless to require successive filings when additional\n\nor different facts bearing on the modification request arise while the proceeding is pending.22 As\n\nlong as a modification petition is filed in good faith, we see no requirement—and no reason—to\n\nlimit the trial court’s consideration of changed circumstances occurring after the modification suit\n\nwas filed, if supported by appropriate pleadings. Any mischief that might ensue without the\n\ntemporal evidentiary limitation Coburn advances would be ameliorated by application of section\n\n156.005 of the Family Code, which requires the trial court to award attorney’s fees against a party\n\n\n        22\n          To the extent such action might be required, Moreland did seek modification of Coburn’s\nchild-support obligation shortly before the modification hearing based on changed circumstances,\nand there was no objection to the amended pleading. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 62, 63, 70 (pertaining to\namended pleadings).\n\n                                                    35\n\fwho files a frivolous or harassing modification suit. See id. § 156.005 (“If the court finds that a suit\n\nfor modification is filed frivolously or is designed to harass a party, the court shall tax attorney’s fees\n\nas costs against the offending party.”).\n\n                In sum, under the unique statutory scheme applicable to modification proceedings,\n\nthere need only be a good-faith basis for instituting a modification suit and, at the end of the day,\n\nsufficient evidence that there has been a material and substantial change of circumstances warranting\n\nmodification of the support order. See id. §§ 156.002 (anyone with standing can file modification\n\nsuit), .004 (rules of civil procedure apply in modification suit), .005 (trial court must award\n\nattorney’s fees if modification suit is filed frivolously or is designed to harass a party); see also Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 13 (governing sanctions for frivolous and bad-faith pleadings). In the present case, there\n\nis sufficient evidence that Moreland had a good-faith basis for seeking modification of the\n\nchild-support order based on (1) the express terms of the agreed divorce decree, (2) Coburn’s\n\napparent change in financial conditions shortly after rendition of the agreed divorce decree, and\n\n(3) his subsequent refusal to disclose the circumstances of that change. There is also sufficient\n\nevidence that the parties considered Coburn to be involuntarily unemployed on the date of the agreed\n\ndecree, and since that time he has become voluntarily underemployed. Accordingly, we hold that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was authorized to modify the\n\nchild-support terms based on a material and substantial change in Coburn’s circumstances.\n\n                In addition to the foregoing issues, Coburn complains that in increasing his\n\nchild-support obligation from $600 per month to $2,716.25 per month, the trial court (1) applied an\n\nimproper legal standard in determining that he was voluntarily underemployed and thus wrongfully\n\n\n\n                                                    36\n\f“deviated” from the statutory child-support guidelines on that basis, (2) failed to specify the reasons\n\nfor awarding more than the percentage guideline maximum in section 154.124, (3) incorrectly\n\ncalculated the children’s support needs, and (4) improperly relied on his voluntary support payments\n\nunder agreed temporary orders. We address these matters in turn.\n\n                Section 154.066 of the Family Code provides that “[i]f the actual income of the\n\nobligor is significantly less than what the obligor could earn because of intentional unemployment\n\nor underemployment, the court may apply the support guidelines to the earning potential of the\n\nobligor.” Id. § 154.066(a).23 At trial, Coburn essentially conceded voluntary underemployment, and\n\nhe does not dispute that evidence on appeal. Rather, he contends that, in order to conclude that he\n\nhad any monthly net resources, the trial court was required to find that he was voluntarily\n\nunderemployed for the purpose of decreasing his child support payments. In support of this position,\n\nhowever, he relies on several cases subsequently disapproved by the Texas Supreme Court. In Iliff\n\nv. Iliff, the supreme court held that\n\n\n        Texas Family Code section 154.066 contains no requirement of proof that an obligor\n        be intentionally unemployed or underemployed for the purposes of avoiding child\n        support. Where a trial court determines that an obligor is intentionally unemployed\n        or underemployed, it is in the court’s discretion to set child support based on earning\n        potential.\n\n\n\n\n        23\n           The same intentional unemployment/underemployment analysis under section 154.066\nmay be applied in both original child-support orders and modifications of existing child-support\norders. See Tex. Fam. Code § 156.402 (allowing the court to consider “the child support guidelines\n. . . under Chapter 154 to determine whether there has been a material or substantial change of\ncircumstances under this chapter that warrants a modification of an existing child support order if\nthe modification is in the best interest of the child”).\n\n                                                  37\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895310\"><a href=\"/opinion/895310/iliff-v-iliff/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 & n.8 (Tex. 2011). The court expressly observed that the limitation Coburn\n\nsuggests here is found nowhere in section 154.066. See id. at 80-81 (“Because section 154.066 is\n\nunambiguous, we decline to read into the statute an extra proof requirement that the Legislature did\n\nnot express.”). Coburn contends, however, that Iliff does not apply in this case because the facts in\n\nIliff involve what he calls a “guidelines” child-support award, rather than a “deviation” from the\n\nchild-support guidelines, which he says occurred in this case. Although this distinction is likewise\n\nabsent from the express language of section 154.066, Coburn argues that a more restrictive definition\n\nof the term “intentional” is applicable when the trial court awards more than would result from strict\n\napplication of the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 of the Family Code. Coburn presumes,\n\nwithout any substantive explanation, that a different “intent” standard applies to the extent an\n\nobligor’s earning potential is found to exceed $7,500 per month.\n\n               Although the supreme court has not made the distinction Coburn suggests, it is\n\napparent from the facts in Iliff that the child-support award in that case was based on an earning\n\npotential that was found to be less than $7,500 per month, which means that the child-support award\n\nat issue there was calculated using the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 of the Family Code\n\nas applied to the obligor’s earning potential. See id. at 77. Section 154.125 is “specifically designed\n\nto apply to situations in which the obligor’s monthly net resources are not greater than $7,500” and\n\nprescribes for such individuals a schedule of percentages that presumptively apply to the obligor’s\n\nnet resources, but only “[i]f the obligor’s monthly net resources are not greater than [$7,500].” Tex.\n\nFam. Code § 154.125(b). A trial court may, however, deviate from those percentage guidelines if\n\nthe evidence rebuts the presumption that application of those amounts is in the child’s best interest.\n\n\n\n                                                  38\n\fSee id. § 154.123(a). The court may consider a number of specifically delineated factors and “any\n\nother reason” in making that determination. See id. § 154.123(b).\n\n               In the present case, the court determined that Coburn’s earning potential is $200,000\n\nper year and his net resources exceed $12,000 per month. Based on these findings, which Coburn\n\nhas not contested, section 154.125 is not applicable. Consequently, the trial court calculated\n\nCoburn’s child-support obligation under section 154.126, which provides a bifurcated analysis for\n\ndetermining child support when the obligor’s monthly net resources exceed $7,500. Under section\n\n154.126, the court “shall presumptively apply the percentage guidelines [from section 154.125] to\n\nthe portion of the obligor’s net resources that does not exceed [$7,500].” Id. § 154.126(a). Then,\n\nthe trial court may, but is not required to, award additional child support based on the child’s actual\n\nsupport needs. Id. If the court so elects, the court must calculate the child’s proven needs, subtract\n\nthe presumptive guideline amount from that figure, and allocate the remainder of the child’s proven\n\nneeds between the parties depending on their income and circumstances. Id. § 154.126(b). The\n\namount of a child-support award under section 154.126 cannot, however, exceed 100 percent of the\n\nchild’s proven needs. Id.\n\n               Accordingly, contrary to Coburn’s claim on appeal, the trial court did not deviate\n\nfrom the percentage guidelines; rather, the trial court applied section 154.126 because section\n\n154.125 by its express terms was not applicable. In accordance with section 154.126, the trial court\n\napplied the presumptive percentage guidelines and then exercised its discretion to award additional\n\nsums above the percentage guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  39\n\f               Implicit in Coburn’s argument is either that the limitation he advances is necessary\n\nto avoid inflated child-support awards or that section 154.066 does not apply to child-support awards\n\nunder section 154.126. We disagree on both counts. In Iliff, the supreme court addressed concerns\n\nabout the potential for unlimited child-support awards based on earning potential and noted that\n\nsection 154.066 only applies when an obligor makes “significantly less” money because of\n\nintentional unemployment or underemployment. Iliff, 339 S.W.3d at 82. The court further noted\n\nthat section 154.066 is permissive and that the trial court’s discretion is tempered by the limits set\n\nin chapter 154 and by the requirement that there be sufficient evidentiary support for a finding of\n\nintentional unemployment or underemployment. Id. As an aside, the court further noted that one\n\nof the limitations in chapter 154 is that the percentage guidelines in section 154.125 apply only to\n\nthe first $7,500 of the obligor’s net monthly resources. Id. at 82 n.7. What was not implicated by\n\nthe facts in Iliff, and thus not discussed, is that even when an obligor has an earning potential in\n\nexcess of $7,500, child-support awards are not unlimited because they are capped at the proven needs\n\nof the child. See Tex. Fam. Code § 154.126.\n\n               Although not directly stating so, Coburn seems to infer from the lower court’s opinion\n\nin Iliff that the phrase “support guidelines” used in section 154.066 refers only to the percentage\n\nguidelines in section 154.125.24 The supreme court did not make such a holding, and we believe\n\nsuch a construction would be incorrect. Chapter 154 of the Family Code devotes an entire\n\nsubchapter to what it deems “child support guidelines.” See id. § 154.121 (“The child support\n\nguidelines in this subchapter are intended to guide the court in determining an equitable amount of\n\n\n       24\n          Coburn does not cite the supreme court’s opinion in Iliff except as subsequent history for\nthe lower-court opinion.\n\n                                                 40\n\fchild support.”). The percentage guidelines in section 154.125 play a prominent, but not exclusive,\n\nrole in the overall support-guideline scheme. Among the support guidelines in chapter 154 is section\n\n154.126, in which the percentage guidelines are but one component of the guidelines for determining\n\nchild support when the obligor’s net resources are in excess of $7,500 per month. Section 154.066\n\ncontains no express or implied limitation that restricts its application to awards under section\n\n154.125 or to the percentage guidelines found in that section. Accordingly, we hold that section\n\n154.066 applies to the child-support award in this case, and as the supreme court held in Iliff, nothing\n\nin that section requires proof that an obligor be intentionally unemployed or underemployed for the\n\npurpose of avoiding child support.\n\n               We further reject Coburn’s contention that the trial court failed to specify its reasons\n\nfor awarding more than the percentage guideline amount. Under section 154.130 of the Family\n\nCode, “if the amount of child support ordered by the court varies from the amount computed by\n\napplying the percentage guidelines under section 154.125,” the trial court must issue a variety of\n\nspecific findings, including “the specific reasons that the amount of child support per month ordered\n\nby the court varies from the amount computed by applying the percentage guidelines under Section\n\n154.125 or 154.129, as applicable.” Id. § 154.130(a)(3), (b). In this case, the percentage guidelines\n\nunder section 154.125 are applicable as a component of the section 154.126 guideline, and the trial\n\ncourt expressly found that (1) Coburn is intentionally underemployed, has the ability to earn\n\n$200,000 per year, and has net monthly resources of $12,736.11, (2) application of the percentage\n\nguidelines in section 154.125 would be unjust or inappropriate and not in the best interests of the\n\nchildren, (3) the proven needs of the children are $3,557.50 per month, and (4) it is in the children’s\n\n\n\n                                                  41\n\fbest interests that Coburn be assigned one half of the children’s proven needs above the percentage\n\nguideline amount. These findings reveal that the trial court exercised its discretion under section\n\n154.066 to base the child-support obligation on Coburn’s earning potential, rather than his actual\n\nincome; that based on Coburn’s earning potential as found by the court, section 154.125 is\n\ninapplicable but the percentage guidelines in that section presumptively apply to the first $7,500 of\n\nCoburn’s net resources, as specified in section 154.126; that the trial court exercised its discretion\n\nto award additional child support under section 154.126 based on the children’s actual support needs\n\nas found by the court; and that the trial court divided the excess support needs equally between the\n\ntwo parents. These findings, which are articulated in both the modification order and the findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law, are specific enough to explain why the trial court awarded child\n\nsupport in excess of the percentage guidelines in section 154.125. This is all that is required under\n\nsection 154.130.\n\n               Next, Coburn challenges the trial court’s calculation of the children’s support needs.\n\nAt trial Moreland introduced evidence concerning the actual expenses incurred to support herself and\n\nthe children each month, including a monthly expense statement she prepared. The expense\n\nstatement included mortgage and household expenses, food and groceries, clothing, medical and\n\nmental-health care and insurance, transportation, life insurance, childcare fees, children’s activities\n\nand entertainment, and other incidentals such as personal grooming and charitable giving.\n\nConsidering Moreland’s evidence, which showed monthly expenses in excess of $10,000, the trial\n\ncourt determined that some of the expenses could be segregated between Moreland and the children\n\nwhile other expenses were not readily divisible between them. With regard to the non-divisible\n\n\n\n                                                  42\n\fexpenses, the trial court allocated to the children one-third of the rental, mortgage, household, and\n\ntransportation expenses and one-half of the expenses for groceries, meals away from home, and\n\nincidentals. Expenses attributable solely to the children—including school lunches, life insurance,\n\nchild care, and summer camps—were fully credited to the children’s support needs. The court\n\ndisregarded expenses that could have been segregated but were not, including medical and\n\nmental-health care, clothing, and shoes. Ultimately, the trial court determined that E.C.’s and P.C.’s\n\nproven needs are $3,557.50 per month. As required by section 154.126, the trial court subtracted\n\nthe percentage guideline maximum of $1,875 from this figure, then divided the excess support needs\n\nequally between the parents to arrive at Coburn’s modified support obligation of $2,716.25.\n\n               Coburn complains that the trial court arbitrarily allocated one-third of the mortgage\n\nand transportation expenses to the children and 100% of the life insurance to the children. He also\n\ncomplains that the trial court improperly included “lifestyle” expenses for maid service, cable\n\ntelevision, yard maintenance, caretaking of the household, cleaning supplies, vehicle maintenance,\n\ncar insurance, and life insurance, which he contends are not properly considered to be “needs” of the\n\nchildren. Although we question whether Coburn properly preserved these complaints for appellate\n\nreview,25 nonetheless, assuming that he did, we hold that the trial court’s allocations were reasonable\n\nand that the inclusion of the disputed expense categories was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n       25\n           In the trial court, Coburn complained about the admission of Moreland’s expenses exhibit\nto the extent it was offered “as a summary of her testimony.” Coburn also generally challenged the\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the needs calculation and requested that the\nlanguage in the order be “modified to reflect that the needs of the children were not proven.” Coburn\ndid not, however, make the specific complaints that he now makes on appeal. See Tex. R. App. P.\n33.1 (timely, specific objection required to preserve issue for appellate review).\n\n                                                  43\n\f               The phrase “needs of the child” is not defined in the Family Code, but courts\n\nhave long held that it is not limited to the “bare necessities of life.” Rodriguez v. Rodriguez,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1733228\"><a href=\"/opinion/1733228/rodriguez-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417 n.3 (Tex. 1993) (applying prior version of Family Code that included similar\n\nlanguage). As a result, the trial court must determine what the needs are on a case-by-case basis by\n\nfollowing the “paramount guiding principle: the best interest of the child.” Id. Coburn points to\n\nno authority that requires segregation of non-divisible expenses, prohibits the trial court from making\n\na reasonable allocation of non-divisible expenses, or prohibits the court from considering the\n\ndisputed expenses as needs of the children. Indeed, while the phrase “needs of the child” is not so\n\nexpansive as to encompass the most extravagant demands, the trial court is given broad discretion\n\nto determine what a child’s reasonable needs are.

Without an objection advising the trial court of the complaints\nCoburn now raises, we would be disinclined to reverse for the trial court to make a different\nallocation of the children’s support needs in excess of the presumptive percentage-guideline\nmaximum.

App.—Corpus Christi 1996, writ denied)\n(court did not abuse its discretion in setting support amount where amount awarded was less than\n100 percent of child’s proven needs and was within statutorily required calculations).\n\n\n                                                  44\n\f                In Coburn’s final challenge to the child-support award, he contends the trial court\n\nimproperly considered his voluntary payment of $1,875 per month when it increased his\n\nchild-support obligation to $2,716.25 per month. The Family Code specifically provides that “[a]\n\nhistory of support voluntarily provided in excess of the court order does not constitute cause to\n\nincrease the amount of an existing child support order.” Tex. Fam. Code § 156.403. Thus, any\n\nvoluntary payments made by Coburn in the past do not provide a basis to increase the amount of\n\nchild support. Coburn alleges that the trial court expressly relied on his voluntary support payments\n\nin violation of section 156.403, citing the following provision in the trial court’s modification order:\n\n\n        IT IS ORDERED that the child support increase under the Temporary Orders filed\n        in this case is acknowledged as KIRK COBURN’S voluntary increase and IT IS\n        ORDERED that the child support was increased retroactively for each month that\n        child support was paid to match the actual child support received by JANET\n        MORELAND. The Court finds that there is no arrearage or overpayment as of June\n        30, 2012.\n\n\n                Thus, in the modification order, the trial court expressly acknowledged that Coburn’s\n\npayment of $1,875 under the prior temporary orders was voluntary and ordered that child support\n\nwas retroactively increased only to the extent of matching amounts actually paid so as to eliminate\n\nany dispute as to an arrearage or overpayment. In finding of fact 45, the trial court likewise\n\ndetermined that there was no arrearage or overpayment of child support as of June 30, 2012. The\n\nincreased child-support obligation of $2,716.25 per month was ordered to begin on July 1, 2012, and\n\nwas not made retroactive. The trial court never cited Coburn’s voluntary payment as a basis for\n\ncalculating child-support going forward, and no reasonable inference to the contrary is found in the\n\nrecord. We conclude that neither the modification order nor the trial court’s findings of fact and\n\n\n                                                  45\n\fconclusions of law supports Coburn’s claim that the trial court based the modified child-support\n\nobligation, in whole or part, on his agreement to voluntarily increase his support payments while the\n\nmodification suit was pending.\n\n               In any case, as previously discussed, the trial court’s support order is amply supported\n\nby sections 154.126 and 154.066 of the Family Code as applied to the court’s findings of voluntary\n\nunderemployment, earning capacity of $200,000 per year, net resources of $12,736.11, the children’s\n\nproven needs of $3,557.50 per month, and equitable division of the children’s additional support\n\nneeds. See id. §§ 154.066 (governing intentional unemployment or underemployment), .126\n\n(governing application of guidelines to net resources exceeding $7,500 per month).27 Consequently,\n\nwe conclude that Coburn’s complaint about his voluntary support payments is without merit.\n\n               Because some evidence of a substantive and probative character supports the trial\n\ncourt’s child-support award, Coburn has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Coburn’s third issue.\n\n\n       Attorney’s Fee Award\n\n               In Coburn’s final appellate issue, he contends the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it awarded Moreland a significant portion of her attorney’s fees because she was not the\n\n“successful” or “prevailing” party and no finding of “good cause” was made or supported by the\n\n\n       27\n            To the extent one could read the trial court’s modification order in the way Coburn\nsuggests, we observe that he submitted to the trial court a proposed order using identical language\nand represented that the order remedied his objections to a proposed order previously submitted by\nMoreland’s counsel. Although Coburn objected to other aspects of the child-support provisions in\nan accompanying letter and in various motions filed with the trial court, he never complained that\nthe trial court violated section 156.403 or improperly considered his voluntary support payments.\nThus, we conclude in the alternative that the complaint is waived. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\n\n                                                 46\n\frecord. Although Moreland successfully defended Coburn’s modification counter-petition and was\n\nafforded material relief on her own petition, the trial court denied her requests to be granted several\n\nexclusive decision-making rights and her request that Coburn be required to exercise possession in\n\nTravis County and take the children to their extracurricular activities and events during that time.\n\nThe trial court also awarded Moreland slightly more than one-third of the increased child support\n\nshe requested.28 Because Moreland was awarded less than all the relief she had requested, Coburn\n\ncontends that she is not a “prevailing party” and that the trial court was required to find both “good\n\ncause” to award her any amount of attorney’s fees and that the fees awarded were incurred “for the\n\nbenefit of the children.” We disagree.\n\n                Under the Family Code, the trial court has discretion to “render judgment for\n\nreasonable attorney’s fees and expenses and order the judgment and postjudgment interest to be paid\n\ndirectly to an attorney.” Id. § 106.002; Bruni v.

Fam.\n\nCode §§ 106.001 (award of costs), .002 (award of attorney’s fees and expenses); cf. id. § 156.005\n\n(“If the court finds that a suit for modification is filed frivolously or is designed to harass a party, the\n\ncourt shall tax attorney’s fees as costs against the offending party.”). As a result, the attorney’s fees\n\nthe trial court awarded in this case are not considered to be “costs.” Cf. In re Nalle Plastics Family\n\nLtd. P’ship, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175-76 (Tex. 2013). This distinction is significant because specific\n\n\n\n        30\n           In 1973 the legislature enacted section 11.18(a) of the Family Code, which provided: “In\nany proceeding under this subtitle, the court may award costs as in other civil cases. Reasonable\nattorney’s fees may be taxed as costs . . . .” Act of June 15, 1973, 63d Leg., R.S., ch. 543, § 1,\n1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1411, 1419. In 1981 section 11.18(a) was amended to omit the “as in other\ncivil cases” language. Act of June 10, 1981, 67th Leg., R.S., ch. 356, § 3, 1981 Tex. Gen. Laws 942,\n944. In 1995 section 11.18(a) was recodified into two newly numbered provisions—section\n106.001, governing costs to be awarded “in the same manner as in other civil cases in a suit,”\nand section 106.002, governing attorney’s fees awarded “as costs.” Act of Apr. 20, 1995,\n74th Leg., R.S., ch. 20, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 113, 133. The statute was amended to its current\nform in 2003, with the “as costs” language removed and replaced with “and expenses.” Act of\nJune 20, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 478, § 1, 2003 Tex. Gen. Laws 1744, 1744. As presently worded,\nsection 106.001, governing costs, no longer includes the “as in other civil cases” language. See Tex.\nFam. Code § 106.001.\n\n                                                    49\n\frules of procedure apply to awards of costs, and it is evident that the “successful party” and “good\n\ncause” requirements reflected in the cited cases were derived from those rules. See Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n131 (“The successful party to a suit shall recover of his adversary all costs incurred therein, except\n\nwhere otherwise provided.”), 141 (“The court may, for good cause, to be stated on the record,\n\nadjudge the costs otherwise than as provided by law or these rules.”); see also Reames, 604 S.W.2d\n\nat 337 (applying rules 131 and 141 to original version of section 106.002, which provided that\n\n“‘[r]easonable attorney’s fees may be taxed as costs’” and that costs may be awarded “as in other\n\ncivil cases”). Because attorney’s fees are not taxed as costs under the present incarnation of section\n\n106.002, neither the rules of procedure governing cost awards nor case law applying those rules are\n\napplicable in this case.\n\n               Moreover, when attorney’s fees were still being taxed as costs under the immediately\n\npreceding version of section 161.002, several courts observed that the statute “[did] not require a\n\nfamily court judgment to state good cause for adjudging costs against the successful party as is\n\nrequired in other civil cases” because “the legislature recognized the difficulty of deciding, in family\n\ncases, which party is successful.” Billeaud v. Billeaud, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1714703\"><a href=\"/opinion/1714703/billeaud-v-billeaud/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 655 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1985, no writ) (discussing amendment to former version of statute that deleted language\n\nrequiring costs to be awarded “as in other civil cases”); see also, e.g., Nichol v. Nichol,\n\nNo. 07-12-00035-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">199652</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Jan. 15, 2014, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (observing that “good cause” requirement had been superseded by statutory amendment in 1981\n\nwhen legislature removed “as in other civil cases” language from prior version of statute); Carlson,\n\n983 S.W.2d at 308-09 (quoting Billeaud, 697 S.W.2d at 655). Although success on the merits and\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\fgood cause may be relevant in considering whether a trial court abused its discretion in awarding one\n\nparty its attorney’s fees under section 106.002, those are not compulsory requirements under the\n\nstatute as presently worded.\n\n                Even in cases applying a “successful party” analysis, we discern no requirement that\n\na party win on all or even most of the requested relief. The absence of a bright-line rule (or even an\n\narticulable rule) in these cases is consistent with the broad discretion trial courts are afforded in\n\nawarding attorney’s fees in SAPCR proceedings. Cf. Lenz v. Lenz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747741/lenz-v-lenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (Tex. 2002).\n\nIt is further consistent with the legislature’s recognition that it is often difficult to identify a\n\n“successful party” in SAPCR proceedings, see Billeaud, 697 S.W.2d at 655, and with the principle\n\nthat the trial court is in the best position “to sense the ‘forces, powers, and influences’ that may not\n\nbe apparent from merely reading the record on appeal.” In re A.L.E., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2341988\"><a href=\"/opinion/2341988/in-re-ale/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.).\n\n                Rarely is one party a clear-cut “winner” in a SAPCR proceeding, and the present case\n\nis no exception. Neither Moreland nor Coburn was a total victor. Although both prevailed to a\n\ndegree, Coburn acknowledges that Moreland achieved significant victory and repeatedly complains\n\non appeal that the trial court’s order was “one-sided.” Even without this concession, it is evident that\n\nMoreland prevailed in substantial and material ways, both in prosecuting her own modification\n\npetition and in defending against Coburn’s counter-petition. There is also more than enough\n\nevidence to support the trial court’s finding that the attorney’s fees awarded to Moreland were\n\nincurred “in order to protect the safety and welfare of the children who are the subject of this suit.”\n\nIn light of the record before the trial court and the deferential standard of review, we cannot conclude\n\n\n\n                                                  51\n\fthat the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Moreland the majority of her attorney’s fees.\n\nWe therefore overrule appellate issue four.\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n               Based on the foregoing analysis, we vacate the portion of the trial court’s judgment\n\nmodifying Coburn’s possession and access to E.C. and P.C. and dismiss as moot that portion of the\n\nappeal. Finding no abuse of discretion as asserted in appellate issues two, three, and four, we affirm\n\nthe remainder of the trial court’s modification order.\n\n\n\n                                       _____________________________________________\n\n                                       J.
