T he bill does not usurp the judicial function by depriving the lower courts of power\n   to hear desegregation cases and to im pose rem edies w hich do not involve busing, nor does it\n   instruct the lower courts how to decide issues of fact in pending cases, or require reversal of any\n   outstanding court order.\n\nThe b ill’s provision prohibiting the Departm ent of Justice from using appropriated funds to bring or\n   m aintain an action to require busing is constitutional despite the lim itations that it would im pose on\n  the Executive’s discretion, since it does not preclude the Departm ent from fulfilling its statutory\n  obligation to enforce the law through seeking other effective rem edies or objecting to inadequate\n  desegregation plans.\n\nBoth the lim itation on courts and on the D epartm ent of Justice should be upheld if challenged under\n  the equal protection com ponent of the Fifth A m endm ent's Due Process Clause, since neither\n   lim itation creates a racial classification nor evidences a discrim inatory purpose\n\n                                                                                                     May 6, 1982\n\nT   he   C   h a ir m a n o f t h e    Com    m it t e e o n t h e        J u d ic ia r y\n             U n it e d S t a t e s H o u s e   of    R   e p r e s e n t a t iv e s\n\n\n\nD e a r M r . C h a i r m a n : This responds to your request concerning those portions\nof S. 951, the Senate-passed version o f the D epartment of Justice appropriation\nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1982, which relate to the mandatory transporta­\ntion of school children to schools other than those closest to their homes\n(“busing”).* One of these provisions relates to the remedial powers of the inferior\ncourts and the other to the authority of the Departm ent of Justice. This letter\ndiscusses the effect of these provisions as well as the policy and constitutional\nimplications of the provisions as construed. The funding provisions of S. 951\nwill be addressed in a separate letter by the Assistant Attorney General of the\nOffice of Legislative Affairs.\n\n\n  ♦ N o t e - The relevant portions o f S 951, 97th C ong , 2d S ess., are reprinted at 128 Cong R ec S ) 3 3 6 (daily ed.\nM ar 2 , 1982) Ed\n\n\n                                                             i\n\f   It is im portant to note at the outset that S. 951 does not withdraw jurisdiction\nfrom the Suprem e C ourt or limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts to decide a\nclass o f cases. T he provisions o f the bill and its legislative history make clear that\nthe effect of these provisions relate only to one aspect of the remedial power of the\ninferior federal courts— not unlike the N orris-L aG uardia Act, enacted in 1932.\nN or do the provisions limit the pow er of state courts or school officials to reassign\nstudents or require transportation to remedy unconstitutional segregation. Care­\nful exam ination o f these provisions indicates that they are constitutional.\n\n                           I. B using Provisions of S. 951\n\n   The first provision, § 2 of the bill, entitled the Neighborhood School Act of\n 1982, recites five congressional findings to the effect that busing is an inade­\nquate, expensive, energy-inefficient, and undesirable remedy. It then states\n(§ 2(d)) that, pursuant to Congress’ power under Article III, § 1 and § 5 of the\nFourteenth A m endm ent, “no co u rt of the United States may order or issue any\nwrit directly or indirectly ordering any student to be assigned or to be transported\nto a public school other than that which is closest to the student’s residence\nunless” such assignm ent or transportation is voluntary or “reasonable.” The bill\ndeclares that such assignment o r transportation is not reasonable if\n\n        (i) there are reasonable alternatives available which involve less\n        tim e in travel, distance, danger, or inconvenience;\n\n        (ii) such assignm ent or transportation requires a student to cross a\n        school district having the sam e grade level as that of the student;\n\n        (iii) such transportation plan or order or part thereof is likely to\n        result in a greater degree o f racial im balance in the public school\n        system than was in existence on the date of the order for such\n        assignm ent o r transportation plan or is likely to have a net harmful\n        effect on the quality of education in the public school district;\n\n        (iv) the total actual daily tim e consumed in travel by schoolbus for\n        any student exceeds thirty m inutes unless such transportation is to\n        and from a public school closest to the student’s residence with a\n        grade level identical to that of the student; or\n\n        (v) the total actual round trip distance traveled by schoolbus for\n        any student exceeds 10 m iles unless the actual round trip distance\n        traveled by schoolbus is to and from the public school closest to\n        the student’s residence w ith a grade level identical to that of the\n        student.\n\nSection 2(f) o f the bill adds a new subparagraph to § 407(a) of Title IV o f the\nCivil R ights A ct o f 1964 , 42 U .S .C . § 2000c-6(a), authorizing suits by the\nAttorney G eneral to enforce rights guaranteed by the bill if he determines that a\nstudent has been required to attend o r be transported to a school in violation of the\n\n                                           2\n\fbill and is otherwise unable to maintain appropriate legal proceedings to obtain\nrelief. The bill is made “retroactive” in that its terms would apply to busing\nordered by federal courts even if such order were entered prior to its effective\ndate. Section 16 of the bill supplements these provisions by providing that\n“[n]otwithstanding any provision of this Act, the Department of Justice shall not\nbe prevented from participating in any proceedings to remove or reduce the\nrequirement of busing in existing court decrees or judgm ents.”\n   The second provision, § 3( 1)(D), limits the power of the Department of Justice\nto bring actions in which the Department would advocate busing as a remedy:\n\n           N o part of any sum authorized to be appropriated by this Act\n        shall be used by the Department of Justice to bring or maintain\n        any sort of action to require directly or indirectly the transporta­\n        tion of any student to a school other than the school which is\n        nearest to the student’s hom e, except for a student requiring\n        special education as a result o f being mentally or physically\n        handicapped.\n\n                             II. General Comments\n\n    There appear to be am biguities in the Neighborhood School A ct’s provisions\nfor suits to be brought by the Attorney General challenging existing decrees. For\nexample, it is unclear what, if any, obligations are placed on the Attorney General\nwith regard to court decrees that offend § 2. Since the bill does not purport to\nprevent any governmental entities other than federal courts from requiring the\ntransportation of students, the Attorney G eneral’s review of a com plaint must\ninclude the inquiry whether the transportation is the result of federal court action.\nIt is difficult to determ ine the party against whom the action is to be brought. The\nassignment violates the Neighborhood School Act only if it is required by court\norder. Does the Attorney General sue the court? If so, then what relief is\nappropriate? Does the bill permit an action against a school board even though its\nactions are not the subject of the bill’s prohibition? If a school board is the\ndefendant, then what relief is appropriate? Does the Attorney General ask that the\nschool board be enjoined from complying with the court order? Does he ask for a\ndeclaratory judgm ent of the board’s obligations under the order? If the latter is the\ncase and the board wishes to continue its present assignment patterns, what will\nhave been accomplished by the lawsuit? These questions illustrate the problems\nincident to the provisions that allow for collateral attack on existing decrees.\n    Serious concern arises also because of the limitation on the Attorney G eneral’s\ndiscretion contained in § 3(1 )(D). This Administration has repeatedly stated its\nobjection to the use of busing to remedy unlawful segregation in public schools.\nSee Testimony of W m . Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney G eneral, Civil\nRights D ivision, Before the Subcomm. on Separation of Powers of the Senate\nComm, on the Judiciary, Desegregation o f Public Schools (Oct. 16, 1981). The\nexpress limitation on the D epartm ent’s authority is unnecessary and may inhibit\n\n                                          3\n\fthe ability to present and advocate remedies which may be less intrusive and\nburdensom e than those being urged on a court by other litigants. Moreover,\nbecause the limitation is imposed only in the D epartm ent’s one-year authoriza­\ntion, there is no force to the argum ent that a statutory provision is necessary to\nensure that successive Administrations will also carry out congressional intent.\nFinally, to the extent that Congress does intend to effect a long-term substantive\nchange in the law, the proper vehicle would seem to be permanent substantive\nlegislation, not an authorization bill which m ust be reviewed annually by Con­\ngress and which becom es more difficult to enact and thus less efficient for its\nnecessary purposes when it is encum bered by extraneous matters.\n\n                              III. Constitutionality\n\nA . Textual Interpretation of the N eighborhood School Act o f 1982\n\n   The N eighborhood School Act restricts the power of inferior federal courts to\nissue rem edial busing decrees w here the transportation requirement would ex­\nceed specified limits of reasonableness. That it does not purport to limit the power\nof state courts or school boards is amply demonstrated by its text and by\nstatem ents of its supporters. Senator Hatch, in a colloquy with Senator Johnston,\nstated that “this bill does not, however, restrict in any way the authority of State\ncourts to enforce the Constitution as they wish . . . .” 127 Cong. Rec. S6648\n(daily ed. June 22, 1981). On the day that the bill passed the Senate, Senator\nJohnston echoed these remarks:\n\n        If a school board wants to bus children all over its parish or all\n        over its county, it is not prohibited from doing so by this amend­\n        m ent. N or indeed would a State court if it undertook to order that\n        busing. The legislation deals only with the power of the Federal\n        courts . . . .\n\n128 C ong. Rec. S1324 (daily ed. March 2, 1982).\n   The im pact o f the Neighborhood School Act on the federal courts is also\nlim ited. It w ithdraw s, in specified circum stances, a single remedy from the\ninferior federal courts. The substantial weight of the text and legislative history\nsupports the proposition that the bill limits the remedial power only of the inferior\nfederal courts, not the Supreme \"Court. There is strong textual support for this\nconclusion, because the bill recites that it is enacted pursuant to congressional\npower under A rticle III, § 1. Section 1 of Article III provides authority for\nlim iting the jurisdiction and the powers of the inferior federal courts, not the\nSuprem e Court. The source of congressional authority relative to the jurisdiction\nof the Suprem e C ourt is the Exceptions Clause, Art. Ill, § 2, cl. 2. The\nconspicuous and apparently intentional omission of that clause as a source of\ncongressional authority to enact this measure strongly indicates that no restriction\nof the Suprem e C ourt appellate jurisdiction was intended.\n\n                                          4\n\f   Moreover, there do not appear to be any direct statements in the legislative\nhistory to the effect that any restriction on the Supreme C ourt’s jurisdiction was\nintended. To the contrary, there is an explicit colloquy between Senators Hatch\nand Johnston indicating that no restriction on Supreme Court jurisdiction was\nintended. In response to a question posed by Senator M athias to Senator\nJohnston, Senator Hatch stated:\n\n           There is little controversy, in my opinion . . . that the constitu­\n        tional power to establish and dismantle inferior Federal courts has\n        given Congress complete authority over their jurisdiction. This\n        has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court . . . .\n\n           This amendment would be only a slight modification of lower\n        Federal court jurisdiction. These inferior Federal courts would\n        no longer have the authority to use one remedy among many for a\n        finding of a constitutional violation.\n\n\n           I would hasten to add that this bill does not, however; restrict in\n       any way . . . the power c f the Supreme Court to review State court\n       p r o c e e d in g s a n d in su re f u l l e n fo rc e m e n t o f co n stitu tio n a l\n       guarantees.\n\n          In short, this is a very, very narrow amendment. It only\n        withdraws a single remedy which Congress finds inappropriate\n       fro m the lower Federal courts.\n                    :f:                                          ^\n\n\n          M R. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished\n        Senator from Utah for his exegesis on the legality, the power of\n        Congress under article III to restrict jurisdiction.\n\n127 Cong. Rec. S6648-49 (daily ed. June 22, 1981) (emphasis added).\n\nB. Legal Status o f Transportation Remedies\n\n   In Brown v. Board o f Education, 349 U .S. 294, 300 (1955) (II), the Supreme\nCourt held that federal courts must be guided by equitable principles in the design\nof judicial remedies for unlawful racial segregation in public school systems.\nUnder those principles, as the Court has more recently explained, “the rem edy is\nnecessarily designed, as all remedies are, to restore the victims of discriminatory\nconduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such\nconduct.” M illiken v. Bradley (Bradley 1), 418 U .S. 717, 746 (1974) (I). The\nCourt has indicated that the principle that justifies judicial discretion to impose\ntransportation remedies also implies a limitation on that discretion.\n   The judicial power to impose such remedies “may be exercised only on the\nbasis of a constitutional violation,” Swann v. Charlotte-M ecklenburg, 402 U.S.\n1, 16 (1971), and “a federal court is required to tailor ‘the scope of the rem edy’ ”\n\n                                                  5\n\fwhich included the transportation of students to schools other than the ones\nwhich they had form erly attended, “to fit ‘the nature and the extent of the\nconstitutional vio latio n ,’ ” Dayton v. Brinkm an, 433 U .S. 406, 420 (1977),\nquoting Bradley I, at 744. In other words, reassignment of students and con­\ncom itant transportation of students to different schools is appropriate only when\nit is “ indeed . . . remedial, ” M illiken v. Bradley (Bradley II), 433 U .S. 2 6 7 ,2 8 0\n(1977) (em phasis in original), that is, when it is aimed at making available to the\nvictim s of unlawful segregation a school system that is free of the taint of such\nsegregation.\n    The Suprem e C ourt has stated that circum stances might conceivably exist in\nw hich the im position of a desegregation remedy which included the transporta­\ntion of students to schools other than the ones which they had formerly attended\nwould be unavoidable in order to vindicate constitutional rights. If school\nauthorities have segregated public school students by race, they shoulder a\nconstitutional obligation “ to elim inate from the public schools all vestiges of\nstate-im posed segregation,” Swann, 402 U .S. at 15. The Court has said that if\nthis duty cannot be fulfilled without the mandatory reassignment of students to\ndifferent schools, with the concom itant requirement of student transportation,\nthis rem edy cannot be statutorily elim inated. In North Carolina v. Swann, 402\nU .S . 43 (1971), the Court overturned a North C arolina statute that proscribed the\nassignm ent o f students to any school on the basis of race, “ or for the purpose of\ncreating a racial balance or ratio in the schools,” and prohibited “ involuntary”\nbusing in violation of the statutory proscription. The Chief Justice, writing for a\nunanim ous C ourt, concluded:\n        [I]f a state-im posed limitation on a school authority’s discretion\n        operates to inhibit or obstruct the operation of a unitary school\n        system or im pede the disestablishing o f a dual school system, it\n        m ust fall; state policy m ust give way when it operates to hinder\n        vindication o f federal constitutional guarantees.\n                   *           *            *            *           sf:\n\n\n           We likewise conclude that an absolute prohibition against\n        transportation of students assigned on the basis of race, “or for the\n        purpose of creating a balance or ratio,” will similarly hamper the\n        ability o f local authorities to effectively remedy constitutional\n        violations. As noted in Swann, supra, at 29, bus transportation\n        has long been an integral part of all public educational systems,\n        and it is unlikely that a truly effective remedy could be devised\n        w ithout continued reliance upon it.\n402 U .S . at 45—46.\n   A lthough the C ourt has indicated that some student transportation might be a\nnecessary incident to a desegregation decree, it has never stated with particularity\nwhat those cases might be, nor has it identified the limitations on busing orders in\ncases where transportation is constitutionally required. In Swann v. Charlotte-\nM e c k le n b u rg , su p ra , fo r exam ple, the C o u rt declined to provide “ rigid\n\n                                            6\n\fguidelines” governing the appropriateness of busing remedies. It stated only that\nbusing was to be limited by factors of time and distance which would “ either risk\nthe health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process.”\n402 U.S. at 30-31. Limits on tim e and distance would vary with many factors,\n“ but probably with none more than the age of the students.” Id. at 31.\n\nC. Congressional Power Under § 5 o f the Fourteenth Amendment\n    In light of the Suprem e C ourt’s conclusion that student transportation m ight in\nsome circumstances be a necessary feature of a remedial desegregation decree, it\nis necessary to consider whether the limitation on the power of the inferior federal\ncourts under the Neighborhood School Act would be justified as an exercise of\ncongressional authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section D,\ninfra, focuses on Congress’ power under Article III, § 1, which is broader in this\ncontext than § 5.\n    Section 5 provides that Congress “ shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation, the provisions of” the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Equal\nProtection Clause, which has been held to guarantee all students a right to be free\nof intentional racial discrim ination or segregation in schooling. Brown v. Board\nc f Education, 347 U .S. 483(1954). The question is whether congressional power\nto enforce that right by appropriate legislation includes authority to limit the\npower of the lower federal courts to award transportation remedies generally and\nspecifically in those cases in which some transportation is necessary fully to\nvindicate constitutional rights.\n    The cases o f K atzenbach v. M organ, 384 U .S . 641 (1966); O regon v.\nMitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970); City c f Rome v. United States, 446 U .S. 156\n(1980); and Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980) (plurality opinion),\nfirmly establish that the § 5 power is a broad one. Congress may enact statutes to\nprevent or to rem edy situations which, on the basis of legislative facts, Congress\ndetermines to be violative of the Constitution. At the same time, these cases\nrather firmly establish that Congress is without power under § 5 to revise the\nC ourt’s constitutional judgm ents if the effect of such revision is to “ restrict,\nabrogate, or dilute” Fourteenth Amendment guarantees as recognized by the\nSupreme Court.\n    The limitation on busing rem edies contained in the Neighborhood School Act\nwould be authorized under § 5 o f the Fourteenth A mendment to the extent that it\ndoes not prevent the inferior federal courts from adequately vindicating constitu­\ntional rights. The grant of power under § 5 to “ enforce” the Fourteenth Am end­\nment carries with it subordinate authority to determine specific methods by\nwhich that am endm ent is to be enforced. As an incident of its enforcement\nauthority, therefore, Congress may instruct the lower federal courts not to order\nmandatory busing in excess of the § 2(d) limits, so long as the court retains\nadequate legal or equitable powers to remedy whatever constitutional violation\nmay be found to exist in a given case.\n    Moreover, federal and state courts would probably pay considerable deference\nto the congressional factfinding upon which the bill is ultimately based in\n\n                                          7\n\fdeterm ining the scope of constitutional requirements in this area. The Court has\nstated that, so long as it can “ perceive a basis” for the congressional findings,\nK atzenbach v. M organ, 384 U .S . at 653, it will uphold a legislative determina­\n tion that a situation exists which either directly violates the Constitution or\n w hich, unless corrected, will lead to a constitutional violation. Similar deference\n would be appropriate for findings under this bill, notwithstanding the somewhat\n lim ited hearings which were held and the absence of printed reports. It does not\nappear that any particularized research was presented to the Senate which might\nhave supported or undermined the specific limitations on federal court decrees\ncontained in § 2(d) o f S. 951. It is likely, however, that the time and distance\nlim itations contained in § 2(d) o f the bill would serve as legitimate benchmarks\nfor federal and state courts in the future in devising appropriate decrees. To this\nextent, the exercise of congressional power under § 5 would be fully proper and\neffective.\n    N or does it appear that the Neighborhood School Act would be interpreted to\n “ d ilu te” Fourteenth Amendment rights merely because it denies a certain form\nof relief in the inferior federal courts or includes certain retroactivity provisions\nin §§ 2 (0 and (g). Congress cannot, under § 5, prohibit a federal district court\nfrom granting a litigant all the relief that the Fourteenth Amendment requires.\nM oreover, the state courts would remain open to persons claiming unconstitu­\ntional segregation in education after this bill becomes law, and would be em ­\npowered— indeed, required—to provide constitutionally adequate relief.\n    U nder § 5 C ongress cannot im pose mandatory restrictions on federal courts in\na given case where the restriction would prevent them from fully remedying the\nconstitutional violation. Congressional power to enforce the Fourteenth Amend­\nm ent is not a pow er to determine the limits of constitutional rights. Although it\nincludes the power to limit the equitable discretion of the lower federal courts to\nim pose rem edial measures which are not necessary to correct the constitutional\nviolation, the courts must retain remedial authority sufficient to correct the\nviolation. And although Congress can express its view through factfinding, but\nsubject to the limitations set forth in § 2(d) of the bill, that busing is an ineffective\nrem edial tool and that extensive busing is not necessary to remedy a constitu­\ntional violation, it is ultimately the responsibility of the courts to determine, after\ngiving due consideration to the congressional findings contained in this bill,\nw hether in a given case an effective remedy requires the use of mandatory busing\nin excess of the limitations set forth in § 2(d) o f the bill.\n    In sum , C ongress, pursuant to § 5, can: (1) limit the authority of federal\ndistrict courts to require student transportation where it is not required by the\nC onstitution; and (2) adopt guidelines, based on legislative factfinding, as to\nw hen busing is effective to rem edy the violation, which guidelines will tend to\nreceive substantial deference from the courts. Section 5 does not, however,\nauthorize C ongress to preclude the inferior federal courts from ordering man­\ndatory busing w hen, in the judgm ent of the courts, such busing is necessary to\nrem edy a constitutional violation. This authority must be found, if at all, in the\n\n                                            8\n\fpower of Congress under Article 111, § 1 to restrict the jurisdiction of the lower\nfederal courts.\n\nD. Congressional Power Under Article III, § I\n\n    Congress’ authority to limit the equitable powers of the inferior federal courts\n has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court. Article 111, § 1 of the\n Constitution provides that “ [t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be\n vested in one suprem e Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may\n from time to tim e ordain and establish.” See also U .S. Const. Art. 1, § 8, cl. 9\n (giving Congress power to “ constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme C ourt” ).\n It seems a necessary inference from the express decision of the Framers that the\ncreation of inferior courts was to rest in the discretion of Congress that, once\ncreated, the scope of the court’s jurisdiction was also discretionary. The view\n that, generally speaking, Congress has very broad control over the inferior\n federal court jurisdiction was accepted by the Supreme Court in Cary v. Curtis,\n44 U.S. (3 How.) 236 (1845), and Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441 (1850).\nThat view rem ains firmly established today.\n    Congress’ power over jurisdiction has been further recognized, most notably\n in cases under the N orris-LaG uardia Act, to include substantial power to limit\nthe remedies available in the inferior federal courts. In L a u f\\. E .G . Shinner &\nC o., 303 U.S. 323, 330 (1938), the C ourt upheld provisions of the N orris-\n LaGuardia Act which imposed restrictions on federal court jurisdiction to issue\nrestraining orders or injunctions in cases growing out of labor disputes. In two\ncases under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, the Supreme Court\nrecognized the power of Congress to withdraw certain cases from the jurisdiction\nof the inferior federal courts and to prohibit any court from issuing temporary\nstays or injunctions. See Lockerty v. Phillips, 319 U .S. 182 (1943); Yakus v.\n United States, 321 U .S. 414 (1944).\n    The provisions of the Neighborhood School Act appear to be firmly grounded\nin Congress’ Article III, § 1 power, as interpreted in Lauf, Lockerty, and Yakus, to\ncontrol the inferior federal court jurisdiction. The bill does not represent an\nattempt by Congress to use its power to limit jurisdiction as a disguise for\nusurping the exercise of judicial power. The bill does not instruct the inferior\nfederal courts how to decide issues o f fact in pending cases. See United States v.\nKlein, 80 U .S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1872).\n    N or does the bill usurp the judicial function by depriving the inferior federal\ncourts of their power to issue any remedy at all. The bill does not withdraw the\nauthority of inferior federal courts to hear desegregation cases or to issue busing\ndecrees, so long as they comport with the limitations in § 2(d) of S. 951. This\nlimited effect on the court’s remedial power does not convert the judicial power—\nto hear and decide particular cases and to grant relief— into the essentially\nlegislative function of deciding cases without any power to issue relief affecting\nindividual legal rights or obligations in specific cases. Whatever implicit lim ita­\n\n                                         9\n\f tions on Congress’ power to control jurisdiction might be contained in the\n principle of separation of powers, they are not exceeded by this bill, which does\n not withdraw all effective remedial power from the inferior federal courts.\n    N either the text of the bill nor the legislative history appears to support the\nconclusion that the bill requires an automatic reversal of any outstanding court\norder that im posed a busing rem edy beyond the limits specified in the bill. Such\nan attem pt to exert direct control over a court order would raise constitutional\nproblem s associated with legislative revision of judgm ents. E .g., Hayburn's\nCase, 2 U .S. (2 D ali.) 409 (1792) (on petition for mandamus). The “retroactive”\neffect is felt instead through a change in the substantive law, in this case the law of\nrem edies, to be applied by courts in determ ining whether to impose or to revise a\nbusing remedy, coupled with the grant of authority to the Attorney General to\nseek relief on behalf o f a student transported in violation of the Act. Upon the\nAttorney G eneral’s application, the court would itself determine whether the\nbusing rem edy was consistent w ith the Act. T he bill, therefore, does no more\nthan require the court to apply the law as it would then exist at the time of its\ndecision in a “ pending” case. S ee The Schooner Peggy, 5 U .S. (1 Cranch) 103\n(1801).\n    The busing rem edy is “ pending” and not final to the extent that the court has\nretained jurisdiction over the case or the order is otherwise subject to modifica­\ntion by the court in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. See United States v.\nS w ift & C o., 2 8 6 U .S . 106, 114—15(1932). Prior to or in the absence of relief by\nthe court from a previously imposed busing order, the parties before the court\nwould be required to continue to perform pursuant to the court’s order. Cf.\nPennsylvania v. W heeling & Belm ont Bridge C o ., 5 9 U .S .(1 8 How.) 421 (1856).\n\nE. C onstitutionality c f § 3(1 )(D)\n\n   Section 3(1 )(D) o f the bill prohibits the Department of Justice from using any\nappropriated funds to bring or maintain any action to require, directly or\nindirectly, virtually any busing o f school children. The D epartm ent’s authority to\ninstitute litigation under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U .S .C .\n§ 2000c-6, against segregated school systems would not be diminished. Nor\nwould the federal courts, under this section, be limited in their power to remedy\nconstitutional violations. The effect of § 3(1)(D) is only to prohibit the Depart­\nm ent in the litigation in which it is involved from seeking, directly or indirectly, a\nbusing remedy. If the language and legislative history of the bill, as finally\nenacted, support this interpretation, it would appear that § 3(1)(D) would be\nupheld despite the limitations that it would im pose on the discretion currently\npossessed by the Executive Branch.\n   T he lim itation would restrict the litigating authority presently conferred upon\nthe D epartm ent by Title IV to seek all necessary relief to vindicate the constitu­\ntional rights at stake. At least in cases that do not involve the use of federal funds\nby segregated school systems, the Executive’s authority may be restricted to this\nlim ited extent. Because the restriction does not entirely preclude enforcement\n\n                                          10\n\factions by the United States, § 3 (l)(D ) does not impermissibly limit the E x­\necutive’s “ inherent” authority to remedy constitutional violations, to the extent\nrecognized in United States v. City c f Philadelphia, 644 F.2d 187 (3d Cir. 1980),\nor N ew York Tim es Co. v. U nited States, 403 U .S. 713, 741—47 (1971)\n(M arshall, J., concurring). And because the restriction applies only to one\nremedy and does not preclude the Department from seeking other effective\nremedies or prevent the Executive from objecting to inadequate desegregation\nplans, § 3( 1)(D) does not exceed the congressional power over the enforcem ent\nauthority that is granted.\n   Where federal funds are provided, § 3( I )(D) would be constitutional if read to\npreserve the governm ent’s ability to fulfill its Fifth Amendment obligations by\ninitiating antidiscrimination suits, restricting only, and in a very limited fashion,\nthe D epartm ent’s participation, by seeking a busing order, in the remedial phase\nof such suits. The Department would be authorized to seek alternative remedies\nand to com m ent on the sufficiency of these alternatives. If the alternative\nremedies to busing are inadequate in a particular case to vindicate the rights at\nstake, the court would retain authority, subject, o f course, to the Neighborhood\nSchool Act provisions, to order a transportation remedy. The Department could\nbe asked to com m ent on the sufficiency of this remedy if ordered by the court.\n   Moreover, § 3(1 )(D) would not appear to disable the Department of Justice\nfrom seeking a court order foreclosing the receipt of federal funding by schools in\nunconstitutionally segregated school systems in those cases, if any, where the\ncourt was prevented by the limits contained in the Neighborhood School Act\nfrom issuing an adequate remedy and the administrative agency was precluded\nfrom terminating federal funds. See Brown v, Califano, 627 F.2d 1221 (D.C. Cir.\n 1980).\n\nF. Due Process Clause\n\n   Finally, both the limitation on the courts under the Neighborhood School Act\nand on the D epartment of Justice under § 3( 1)(D) should be upheld if challenged\nunder the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendm ent’s Due Process\nClause, see Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U .S. 497 (1954), as a deprivation of a judicial\nremedy from a racially identifiable group. These provisions neither create a racial\nclassification nor evidence a discriminatory purpose. Absent either of these\nconstitutional flaws, the provisions will be upheld if they are rationally related to\na legitimate government purpose. See Harris v. M cRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980).\n   As the law has developed, the courts will review statutory classifications\naccording to a “ strict scrutiny” standard either if they create a racial or other\n“ suspect” classification, e .g .. H unter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969), or if\nthey reflect an invidious discriminatory purpose. E .g ., Village o f Arlington\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977);\nWashington v. D avis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976); cf. City o f M obile v. Bolden, 446\nU.S. 55 (1980) (plurality opinion). Satisfaction of the strict scrutiny standard\nrequires a classification that is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling govem-\n\n                                         11\n\fm ental interest. N either basis for invoicing strict scrutiny appears to be applicable\nhere.\n    First, these provisions, unlike the provision found unconstitutional in H unter\nv. Erickson, supra, do not contain a racial classification. Mandatory busing for\nthe purpose of achieving racial balance is only one of the circumstances in which\nstudent transportation is placed o ff limits to Justice Department suits or district\ncourt orders. The proposals prohibit Justice D epartment suits or court orders for\nthe transportation of students specified distances or away from the schools nearest\ntheir hom es for any reason. Moreover, a racial classification would not result even\nif these provisions limited advocacy or ordering of mandatory busing only to\nachieve racial integration. The issue o f what sorts of remedies the Justice\nD epartm ent should advocate or the federal district courts should order simply\ndoes not split the citizenry into discrete racial subgroups. Cf. Personnel Adm in­\nistrator v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979).\n    S econd, there appears to be no evidence of purposeful discrimination. W hat­\never m ight be the arguable impact on racial m inorities, the legislative history to\ndate contains no suggestion o f an invidious discriminatory purpose. To the\ncontrary, the sponsors and supporters of these measures endorsed the decision in\nBrown v. B oard o f Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and repeatedly stated their\nabhorrence of de ju re segregation in schooling. The proponents rest their support\no f this legislation on the conclusion that busing has been destructive not only of\nquality education for all students but also of the goal of desegregation. Even the\nopponents of the bill did not suggest that any invidious purpose was present.\n    Accordingly, the bill will not be subject to review under the strict scrutiny\nstandard. Instead, the bill will be reviewed, and upheld, under the principles of\nequal protection, if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\nThis test is a highly deferential one. It is reasonably clear that the defects in\nbusing noted by the proponents o f the bill and discussed above would suffice to\nsatisfy the m inim um rationality standard. Moreover, the proponents of these\nprovisions advanced other rationales to support the measure, including that\nm andatory busing is an excessive burden on the taxpayer; that it wastes scarce\npetroleum reserves; and that education is a local matter that should be adm in­\nistered on a local level. These reasons appear to be legitimate governmental\npurposes, and the busing restrictions appear to be rationally related to these\npurposes.\n    It should be noted in closing that these conclusions are predicated in substan­\ntial part on the legislative history of this bill to date. Subsequent history in the\nH ouse or thereafter could well affect these views.\n\n                                                 Sincerely,\n                                                 W   il l ia m   F r e n c h S m it h\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f",

T he bill does not usurp the judicial function by depriving the lower courts of power\n   to hear desegregation cases and to im pose rem edies w hich do not involve busing, nor does it\n   instruct the lower courts how to decide issues of fact in pending cases, or require reversal of any\n   outstanding court order.\n\nThe b ill’s provision prohibiting the Departm ent of Justice from using appropriated funds to bring or\n   m aintain an action to require busing is constitutional despite the lim itations that it would im pose on\n  the Executive’s discretion, since it does not preclude the Departm ent from fulfilling its statutory\n  obligation to enforce the law through seeking other effective rem edies or objecting to inadequate\n  desegregation plans.\n\nBoth the lim itation on courts and on the D epartm ent of Justice should be upheld if challenged under\n  the equal protection com ponent of the Fifth A m endm ent's Due Process Clause, since neither\n   lim itation creates a racial classification nor evidences a discrim inatory purpose\n\n                                                                                                     May 6, 1982\n\nT   he   C   h a ir m a n o f t h e    Com    m it t e e o n t h e        J u d ic ia r y\n             U n it e d S t a t e s H o u s e   of    R   e p r e s e n t a t iv e s\n\n\n\nD e a r M r . C h a i r m a n : This responds to your request concerning those portions\nof S. 951, the Senate-passed version o f the D epartment of Justice appropriation\nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1982, which relate to the mandatory transporta­\ntion of school children to schools other than those closest to their homes\n(“busing”).* One of these provisions relates to the remedial powers of the inferior\ncourts and the other to the authority of the Departm ent of Justice. This letter\ndiscusses the effect of these provisions as well as the policy and constitutional\nimplications of the provisions as construed. The funding provisions of S. 951\nwill be addressed in a separate letter by the Assistant Attorney General of the\nOffice of Legislative Affairs.\n\n\n  ♦ N o t e - The relevant portions o f S 951, 97th C ong , 2d S ess., are reprinted at 128 Cong R ec S ) 3 3 6 (daily ed.\nM ar 2 , 1982) Ed\n\n\n                                                             i\n\f   It is im portant to note at the outset that S. 951 does not withdraw jurisdiction\nfrom the Suprem e C ourt or limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts to decide a\nclass o f cases. T he provisions o f the bill and its legislative history make clear that\nthe effect of these provisions relate only to one aspect of the remedial power of the\ninferior federal courts— not unlike the N orris-L aG uardia Act, enacted in 1932.\nN or do the provisions limit the pow er of state courts or school officials to reassign\nstudents or require transportation to remedy unconstitutional segregation. Care­\nful exam ination o f these provisions indicates that they are constitutional.\n\n                           I. B using Provisions of S. 951\n\n   The first provision, § 2 of the bill, entitled the Neighborhood School Act of\n 1982, recites five congressional findings to the effect that busing is an inade­\nquate, expensive, energy-inefficient, and undesirable remedy. It then states\n(§ 2(d)) that, pursuant to Congress’ power under Article III, § 1 and § 5 of the\nFourteenth A m endm ent, “no co u rt of the United States may order or issue any\nwrit directly or indirectly ordering any student to be assigned or to be transported\nto a public school other than that which is closest to the student’s residence\nunless” such assignm ent or transportation is voluntary or “reasonable.” The bill\ndeclares that such assignment o r transportation is not reasonable if\n\n        (i) there are reasonable alternatives available which involve less\n        tim e in travel, distance, danger, or inconvenience;\n\n        (ii) such assignm ent or transportation requires a student to cross a\n        school district having the sam e grade level as that of the student;\n\n        (iii) such transportation plan or order or part thereof is likely to\n        result in a greater degree o f racial im balance in the public school\n        system than was in existence on the date of the order for such\n        assignm ent o r transportation plan or is likely to have a net harmful\n        effect on the quality of education in the public school district;\n\n        (iv) the total actual daily tim e consumed in travel by schoolbus for\n        any student exceeds thirty m inutes unless such transportation is to\n        and from a public school closest to the student’s residence with a\n        grade level identical to that of the student; or\n\n        (v) the total actual round trip distance traveled by schoolbus for\n        any student exceeds 10 m iles unless the actual round trip distance\n        traveled by schoolbus is to and from the public school closest to\n        the student’s residence w ith a grade level identical to that of the\n        student.\n\nSection 2(f) o f the bill adds a new subparagraph to § 407(a) of Title IV o f the\nCivil R ights A ct o f 1964 , 42 U .S .C . § 2000c-6(a), authorizing suits by the\nAttorney G eneral to enforce rights guaranteed by the bill if he determines that a\nstudent has been required to attend o r be transported to a school in violation of the\n\n                                           2\n\fbill and is otherwise unable to maintain appropriate legal proceedings to obtain\nrelief. The bill is made “retroactive” in that its terms would apply to busing\nordered by federal courts even if such order were entered prior to its effective\ndate. Section 16 of the bill supplements these provisions by providing that\n“[n]otwithstanding any provision of this Act, the Department of Justice shall not\nbe prevented from participating in any proceedings to remove or reduce the\nrequirement of busing in existing court decrees or judgm ents.”\n   The second provision, § 3( 1)(D), limits the power of the Department of Justice\nto bring actions in which the Department would advocate busing as a remedy:\n\n           N o part of any sum authorized to be appropriated by this Act\n        shall be used by the Department of Justice to bring or maintain\n        any sort of action to require directly or indirectly the transporta­\n        tion of any student to a school other than the school which is\n        nearest to the student’s hom e, except for a student requiring\n        special education as a result o f being mentally or physically\n        handicapped.\n\n                             II. General Comments\n\n    There appear to be am biguities in the Neighborhood School A ct’s provisions\nfor suits to be brought by the Attorney General challenging existing decrees. For\nexample, it is unclear what, if any, obligations are placed on the Attorney General\nwith regard to court decrees that offend § 2. Since the bill does not purport to\nprevent any governmental entities other than federal courts from requiring the\ntransportation of students, the Attorney G eneral’s review of a com plaint must\ninclude the inquiry whether the transportation is the result of federal court action.\nIt is difficult to determ ine the party against whom the action is to be brought. The\nassignment violates the Neighborhood School Act only if it is required by court\norder. Does the Attorney General sue the court? If so, then what relief is\nappropriate? Does the bill permit an action against a school board even though its\nactions are not the subject of the bill’s prohibition? If a school board is the\ndefendant, then what relief is appropriate? Does the Attorney General ask that the\nschool board be enjoined from complying with the court order? Does he ask for a\ndeclaratory judgm ent of the board’s obligations under the order? If the latter is the\ncase and the board wishes to continue its present assignment patterns, what will\nhave been accomplished by the lawsuit? These questions illustrate the problems\nincident to the provisions that allow for collateral attack on existing decrees.\n    Serious concern arises also because of the limitation on the Attorney G eneral’s\ndiscretion contained in § 3(1 )(D). This Administration has repeatedly stated its\nobjection to the use of busing to remedy unlawful segregation in public schools.\nSee Testimony of W m . Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney G eneral, Civil\nRights D ivision, Before the Subcomm. on Separation of Powers of the Senate\nComm, on the Judiciary, Desegregation o f Public Schools (Oct. 16, 1981). The\nexpress limitation on the D epartm ent’s authority is unnecessary and may inhibit\n\n                                          3\n\fthe ability to present and advocate remedies which may be less intrusive and\nburdensom e than those being urged on a court by other litigants. Moreover,\nbecause the limitation is imposed only in the D epartm ent’s one-year authoriza­\ntion, there is no force to the argum ent that a statutory provision is necessary to\nensure that successive Administrations will also carry out congressional intent.\nFinally, to the extent that Congress does intend to effect a long-term substantive\nchange in the law, the proper vehicle would seem to be permanent substantive\nlegislation, not an authorization bill which m ust be reviewed annually by Con­\ngress and which becom es more difficult to enact and thus less efficient for its\nnecessary purposes when it is encum bered by extraneous matters.\n\n                              III. Constitutionality\n\nA . Textual Interpretation of the N eighborhood School Act o f 1982\n\n   The N eighborhood School Act restricts the power of inferior federal courts to\nissue rem edial busing decrees w here the transportation requirement would ex­\nceed specified limits of reasonableness. That it does not purport to limit the power\nof state courts or school boards is amply demonstrated by its text and by\nstatem ents of its supporters. Senator Hatch, in a colloquy with Senator Johnston,\nstated that “this bill does not, however, restrict in any way the authority of State\ncourts to enforce the Constitution as they wish . . . .” 127 Cong. Rec. S6648\n(daily ed. June 22, 1981). On the day that the bill passed the Senate, Senator\nJohnston echoed these remarks:\n\n        If a school board wants to bus children all over its parish or all\n        over its county, it is not prohibited from doing so by this amend­\n        m ent. N or indeed would a State court if it undertook to order that\n        busing. The legislation deals only with the power of the Federal\n        courts . . . .\n\n128 C ong. Rec. S1324 (daily ed. March 2, 1982).\n   The im pact o f the Neighborhood School Act on the federal courts is also\nlim ited. It w ithdraw s, in specified circum stances, a single remedy from the\ninferior federal courts. The substantial weight of the text and legislative history\nsupports the proposition that the bill limits the remedial power only of the inferior\nfederal courts, not the Supreme \"Court. There is strong textual support for this\nconclusion, because the bill recites that it is enacted pursuant to congressional\npower under A rticle III, § 1. Section 1 of Article III provides authority for\nlim iting the jurisdiction and the powers of the inferior federal courts, not the\nSuprem e Court. The source of congressional authority relative to the jurisdiction\nof the Suprem e C ourt is the Exceptions Clause, Art. Ill, § 2, cl. 2. The\nconspicuous and apparently intentional omission of that clause as a source of\ncongressional authority to enact this measure strongly indicates that no restriction\nof the Suprem e C ourt appellate jurisdiction was intended.\n\n                                          4\n\f   Moreover, there do not appear to be any direct statements in the legislative\nhistory to the effect that any restriction on the Supreme C ourt’s jurisdiction was\nintended. To the contrary, there is an explicit colloquy between Senators Hatch\nand Johnston indicating that no restriction on Supreme Court jurisdiction was\nintended. In response to a question posed by Senator M athias to Senator\nJohnston, Senator Hatch stated:\n\n           There is little controversy, in my opinion . . . that the constitu­\n        tional power to establish and dismantle inferior Federal courts has\n        given Congress complete authority over their jurisdiction. This\n        has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court . . . .\n\n           This amendment would be only a slight modification of lower\n        Federal court jurisdiction. These inferior Federal courts would\n        no longer have the authority to use one remedy among many for a\n        finding of a constitutional violation.\n\n\n           I would hasten to add that this bill does not, however; restrict in\n       any way . . . the power c f the Supreme Court to review State court\n       p r o c e e d in g s a n d in su re f u l l e n fo rc e m e n t o f co n stitu tio n a l\n       guarantees.\n\n          In short, this is a very, very narrow amendment. It only\n        withdraws a single remedy which Congress finds inappropriate\n       fro m the lower Federal courts.\n                    :f:                                          ^\n\n\n          M R.

Board o f Education, 349 U .S. 294, 300 (1955) (II), the Supreme\nCourt held that federal courts must be guided by equitable principles in the design\nof judicial remedies for unlawful racial segregation in public school systems.\nUnder those principles, as the Court has more recently explained, “the rem edy is\nnecessarily designed, as all remedies are, to restore the victims of discriminatory\nconduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such\nconduct.” M illiken v. Bradley (Bradley 1), 418 U .S. 717, 746 (1974) (I). The\nCourt has indicated that the principle that justifies judicial discretion to impose\ntransportation remedies also implies a limitation on that discretion.\n   The judicial power to impose such remedies “may be exercised only on the\nbasis of a constitutional violation,” Swann v. Charlotte-M ecklenburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1971), and “a federal court is required to tailor ‘the scope of the rem edy’ ”\n\n                                                  5\n\fwhich included the transportation of students to schools other than the ones\nwhich they had form erly attended, “to fit ‘the nature and the extent of the\nconstitutional vio latio n ,’ ” Dayton v. Brinkm an, 433 U .S. 406, 420 (1977),\nquoting Bradley I, at 744. In other words, reassignment of students and con­\ncom itant transportation of students to different schools is appropriate only when\nit is “ indeed . . . remedial, ” M illiken v. Bradley (Bradley II), 433 U .S. 2 6 7 ,2 8 0\n(1977) (em phasis in original), that is, when it is aimed at making available to the\nvictim s of unlawful segregation a school system that is free of the taint of such\nsegregation.\n    The Suprem e C ourt has stated that circum stances might conceivably exist in\nw hich the im position of a desegregation remedy which included the transporta­\ntion of students to schools other than the ones which they had formerly attended\nwould be unavoidable in order to vindicate constitutional rights. If school\nauthorities have segregated public school students by race, they shoulder a\nconstitutional obligation “ to elim inate from the public schools all vestiges of\nstate-im posed segregation,” Swann, 402 U .S. at 15. The Court has said that if\nthis duty cannot be fulfilled without the mandatory reassignment of students to\ndifferent schools, with the concom itant requirement of student transportation,\nthis rem edy cannot be statutorily elim inated. In North Carolina v. Swann, 402\nU .S . 43 (1971), the Court overturned a North C arolina statute that proscribed the\nassignm ent o f students to any school on the basis of race, “ or for the purpose of\ncreating a racial balance or ratio in the schools,” and prohibited “ involuntary”\nbusing in violation of the statutory proscription. The Chief Justice, writing for a\nunanim ous C ourt, concluded:\n        [I]f a state-im posed limitation on a school authority’s discretion\n        operates to inhibit or obstruct the operation of a unitary school\n        system or im pede the disestablishing o f a dual school system, it\n        m ust fall; state policy m ust give way when it operates to hinder\n        vindication o f federal constitutional guarantees.\n                   *           *            *            *           sf:\n\n\n           We likewise conclude that an absolute prohibition against\n        transportation of students assigned on the basis of race, “or for the\n        purpose of creating a balance or ratio,” will similarly hamper the\n        ability o f local authorities to effectively remedy constitutional\n        violations. As noted in Swann, supra, at 29, bus transportation\n        has long been an integral part of all public educational systems,\n        and it is unlikely that a truly effective remedy could be devised\n        w ithout continued reliance upon it.\n402 U .S . at 45—46.\n   A lthough the C ourt has indicated that some student transportation might be a\nnecessary incident to a desegregation decree, it has never stated with particularity\nwhat those cases might be, nor has it identified the limitations on busing orders in\ncases where transportation is constitutionally required. In Swann v. Charlotte-\nM e c k le n b u rg , su p ra , fo r exam ple, the C o u rt declined to provide “ rigid\n\n                                            6\n\fguidelines” governing the appropriateness of busing remedies. It stated only that\nbusing was to be limited by factors of time and distance which would “ either risk\nthe health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process.”\n402 U.S. at 30-31. Limits on tim e and distance would vary with many factors,\n“ but probably with none more than the age of the students.” Id. at 31.\n\nC. Congressional Power Under § 5 o f the Fourteenth Amendment\n    In light of the Suprem e C ourt’s conclusion that student transportation m ight in\nsome circumstances be a necessary feature of a remedial desegregation decree, it\nis necessary to consider whether the limitation on the power of the inferior federal\ncourts under the Neighborhood School Act would be justified as an exercise of\ncongressional authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section D,\ninfra, focuses on Congress’ power under Article III, § 1, which is broader in this\ncontext than § 5.\n    Section 5 provides that Congress “ shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation, the provisions of” the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Equal\nProtection Clause, which has been held to guarantee all students a right to be free\nof intentional racial discrim ination or segregation in schooling. Brown v. Board\nc f Education, 347 U .S. 483(1954). The question is whether congressional power\nto enforce that right by appropriate legislation includes authority to limit the\npower of the lower federal courts to award transportation remedies generally and\nspecifically in those cases in which some transportation is necessary fully to\nvindicate constitutional rights.\n    The cases o f K atzenbach v. M organ, 384 U .S . 641 (1966); O regon v.\nMitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108221\"><a href=\"/opinion/108221/oregon-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970); City c f Rome v.

Congress may enact statutes to\nprevent or to rem edy situations which, on the basis of legislative facts, Congress\ndetermines to be violative of the Constitution. At the same time, these cases\nrather firmly establish that Congress is without power under § 5 to revise the\nC ourt’s constitutional judgm ents if the effect of such revision is to “ restrict,\nabrogate, or dilute” Fourteenth Amendment guarantees as recognized by the\nSupreme Court.\n    The limitation on busing rem edies contained in the Neighborhood School Act\nwould be authorized under § 5 o f the Fourteenth A mendment to the extent that it\ndoes not prevent the inferior federal courts from adequately vindicating constitu­\ntional rights. The grant of power under § 5 to “ enforce” the Fourteenth Am end­\nment carries with it subordinate authority to determine specific methods by\nwhich that am endm ent is to be enforced. As an incident of its enforcement\nauthority, therefore, Congress may instruct the lower federal courts not to order\nmandatory busing in excess of the § 2(d) limits, so long as the court retains\nadequate legal or equitable powers to remedy whatever constitutional violation\nmay be found to exist in a given case.\n    Moreover, federal and state courts would probably pay considerable deference\nto the congressional factfinding upon which the bill is ultimately based in\n\n                                          7\n\fdeterm ining the scope of constitutional requirements in this area. The Court has\nstated that, so long as it can “ perceive a basis” for the congressional findings,\nK atzenbach v. M organ, 384 U .S . at 653, it will uphold a legislative determina­\n tion that a situation exists which either directly violates the Constitution or\n w hich, unless corrected, will lead to a constitutional violation. Similar deference\n would be appropriate for findings under this bill, notwithstanding the somewhat\n lim ited hearings which were held and the absence of printed reports. It does not\nappear that any particularized research was presented to the Senate which might\nhave supported or undermined the specific limitations on federal court decrees\ncontained in § 2(d) o f S. 951. It is likely, however, that the time and distance\nlim itations contained in § 2(d) o f the bill would serve as legitimate benchmarks\nfor federal and state courts in the future in devising appropriate decrees. To this\nextent, the exercise of congressional power under § 5 would be fully proper and\neffective.\n    N or does it appear that the Neighborhood School Act would be interpreted to\n “ d ilu te” Fourteenth Amendment rights merely because it denies a certain form\nof relief in the inferior federal courts or includes certain retroactivity provisions\nin §§ 2 (0 and (g). Congress cannot, under § 5, prohibit a federal district court\nfrom granting a litigant all the relief that the Fourteenth Amendment requires.\nM oreover, the state courts would remain open to persons claiming unconstitu­\ntional segregation in education after this bill becomes law, and would be em ­\npowered— indeed, required—to provide constitutionally adequate relief.\n    U nder § 5 C ongress cannot im pose mandatory restrictions on federal courts in\na given case where the restriction would prevent them from fully remedying the\nconstitutional violation. Congressional power to enforce the Fourteenth Amend­\nm ent is not a pow er to determine the limits of constitutional rights. Although it\nincludes the power to limit the equitable discretion of the lower federal courts to\nim pose rem edial measures which are not necessary to correct the constitutional\nviolation, the courts must retain remedial authority sufficient to correct the\nviolation. And although Congress can express its view through factfinding, but\nsubject to the limitations set forth in § 2(d) of the bill, that busing is an ineffective\nrem edial tool and that extensive busing is not necessary to remedy a constitu­\ntional violation, it is ultimately the responsibility of the courts to determine, after\ngiving due consideration to the congressional findings contained in this bill,\nw hether in a given case an effective remedy requires the use of mandatory busing\nin excess of the limitations set forth in § 2(d) o f the bill.\n    In sum , C ongress, pursuant to § 5, can: (1) limit the authority of federal\ndistrict courts to require student transportation where it is not required by the\nC onstitution; and (2) adopt guidelines, based on legislative factfinding, as to\nw hen busing is effective to rem edy the violation, which guidelines will tend to\nreceive substantial deference from the courts. Section 5 does not, however,\nauthorize C ongress to preclude the inferior federal courts from ordering man­\ndatory busing w hen, in the judgm ent of the courts, such busing is necessary to\nrem edy a constitutional violation. This authority must be found, if at all, in the\n\n                                            8\n\fpower of Congress under Article 111, § 1 to restrict the jurisdiction of the lower\nfederal courts.\n\nD. Congressional Power Under Article III, § I\n\n    Congress’ authority to limit the equitable powers of the inferior federal courts\n has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court. Article 111, § 1 of the\n Constitution provides that “ [t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be\n vested in one suprem e Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may\n from time to tim e ordain and establish.” See also U .S. Const. Art. 1, § 8, cl. 9\n (giving Congress power to “ constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme C ourt” ).\n It seems a necessary inference from the express decision of the Framers that the\ncreation of inferior courts was to rest in the discretion of Congress that, once\ncreated, the scope of the court’s jurisdiction was also discretionary. The view\n that, generally speaking, Congress has very broad control over the inferior\n federal court jurisdiction was accepted by the Supreme Court in Cary v. Curtis,\n44 U.S. (3 How.) 236 (1845), and Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441 (1850).\nThat view rem ains firmly established today.\n    Congress’ power over jurisdiction has been further recognized, most notably\n in cases under the N orris-LaG uardia Act, to include substantial power to limit\nthe remedies available in the inferior federal courts. In L a u f\\. E .G . Shinner &\nC o., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102980\"><a href=\"/opinion/102980/lauf-v-eg-shinner-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (1938), the C ourt upheld provisions of the N orris-\n LaGuardia Act which imposed restrictions on federal court jurisdiction to issue\nrestraining orders or injunctions in cases growing out of labor disputes. In two\ncases under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, the Supreme Court\nrecognized the power of Congress to withdraw certain cases from the jurisdiction\nof the inferior federal courts and to prohibit any court from issuing temporary\nstays or injunctions. See Lockerty v. Phillips, 319 U .S. 182 (1943); Yakus v.\n United States, 321 U .S. 414 (1944).\n    The provisions of the Neighborhood School Act appear to be firmly grounded\nin Congress’ Article III, § 1 power, as interpreted in Lauf, Lockerty, and Yakus, to\ncontrol the inferior federal court jurisdiction. The bill does not represent an\nattempt by Congress to use its power to limit jurisdiction as a disguise for\nusurping the exercise of judicial power. The bill does not instruct the inferior\nfederal courts how to decide issues o f fact in pending cases. See United States v.\nKlein, 80 U .S. (13 Wall.) 128 (1872).\n    N or does the bill usurp the judicial function by depriving the inferior federal\ncourts of their power to issue any remedy at all. The bill does not withdraw the\nauthority of inferior federal courts to hear desegregation cases or to issue busing\ndecrees, so long as they comport with the limitations in § 2(d) of S. 951. This\nlimited effect on the court’s remedial power does not convert the judicial power—\nto hear and decide particular cases and to grant relief— into the essentially\nlegislative function of deciding cases without any power to issue relief affecting\nindividual legal rights or obligations in specific cases. Whatever implicit lim ita­\n\n                                         9\n\f tions on Congress’ power to control jurisdiction might be contained in the\n principle of separation of powers, they are not exceeded by this bill, which does\n not withdraw all effective remedial power from the inferior federal courts.\n    N either the text of the bill nor the legislative history appears to support the\nconclusion that the bill requires an automatic reversal of any outstanding court\norder that im posed a busing rem edy beyond the limits specified in the bill. Such\nan attem pt to exert direct control over a court order would raise constitutional\nproblem s associated with legislative revision of judgm ents. E .g., Hayburn's\nCase, 2 U .S. (2 D ali.) 409 (1792) (on petition for mandamus). The “retroactive”\neffect is felt instead through a change in the substantive law, in this case the law of\nrem edies, to be applied by courts in determ ining whether to impose or to revise a\nbusing remedy, coupled with the grant of authority to the Attorney General to\nseek relief on behalf o f a student transported in violation of the Act. Upon the\nAttorney G eneral’s application, the court would itself determine whether the\nbusing rem edy was consistent w ith the Act. T he bill, therefore, does no more\nthan require the court to apply the law as it would then exist at the time of its\ndecision in a “ pending” case. S ee The Schooner Peggy, 5 U .S. (1 Cranch) 103\n(1801).\n    The busing rem edy is “ pending” and not final to the extent that the court has\nretained jurisdiction over the case or the order is otherwise subject to modifica­\ntion by the court in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. See United States v.\nS w ift & C o., 2 8 6 U .S . 106, 114—15(1932). Prior to or in the absence of relief by\nthe court from a previously imposed busing order, the parties before the court\nwould be required to continue to perform pursuant to the court’s order. Cf.\nPennsylvania v. W heeling & Belm ont Bridge C o ., 5 9 U .S .(1 8 How.) 421 (1856).\n\nE. C onstitutionality c f § 3(1 )(D)\n\n   Section 3(1 )(D) o f the bill prohibits the Department of Justice from using any\nappropriated funds to bring or maintain any action to require, directly or\nindirectly, virtually any busing o f school children. The D epartm ent’s authority to\ninstitute litigation under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U .S .C .\n§ 2000c-6, against segregated school systems would not be diminished. Nor\nwould the federal courts, under this section, be limited in their power to remedy\nconstitutional violations. The effect of § 3(1)(D) is only to prohibit the Depart­\nm ent in the litigation in which it is involved from seeking, directly or indirectly, a\nbusing remedy. If the language and legislative history of the bill, as finally\nenacted, support this interpretation, it would appear that § 3(1)(D) would be\nupheld despite the limitations that it would im pose on the discretion currently\npossessed by the Executive Branch.\n   T he lim itation would restrict the litigating authority presently conferred upon\nthe D epartm ent by Title IV to seek all necessary relief to vindicate the constitu­\ntional rights at stake. At least in cases that do not involve the use of federal funds\nby segregated school systems, the Executive’s authority may be restricted to this\nlim ited extent. Because the restriction does not entirely preclude enforcement\n\n                                          10\n\factions by the United States, § 3 (l)(D ) does not impermissibly limit the E x­\necutive’s “ inherent” authority to remedy constitutional violations, to the extent\nrecognized in United States v.

U nited States, 403 U .S. 713, 741—47 (1971)\n(M arshall, J., concurring). And because the restriction applies only to one\nremedy and does not preclude the Department from seeking other effective\nremedies or prevent the Executive from objecting to inadequate desegregation\nplans, § 3( 1)(D) does not exceed the congressional power over the enforcem ent\nauthority that is granted.\n   Where federal funds are provided, § 3( I )(D) would be constitutional if read to\npreserve the governm ent’s ability to fulfill its Fifth Amendment obligations by\ninitiating antidiscrimination suits, restricting only, and in a very limited fashion,\nthe D epartm ent’s participation, by seeking a busing order, in the remedial phase\nof such suits. The Department would be authorized to seek alternative remedies\nand to com m ent on the sufficiency of these alternatives. If the alternative\nremedies to busing are inadequate in a particular case to vindicate the rights at\nstake, the court would retain authority, subject, o f course, to the Neighborhood\nSchool Act provisions, to order a transportation remedy. The Department could\nbe asked to com m ent on the sufficiency of this remedy if ordered by the court.\n   Moreover, § 3(1 )(D) would not appear to disable the Department of Justice\nfrom seeking a court order foreclosing the receipt of federal funding by schools in\nunconstitutionally segregated school systems in those cases, if any, where the\ncourt was prevented by the limits contained in the Neighborhood School Act\nfrom issuing an adequate remedy and the administrative agency was precluded\nfrom terminating federal funds.

Sharpe, 347 U .S. 497 (1954), as a deprivation of a judicial\nremedy from a racially identifiable group.

N either basis for invoicing strict scrutiny appears to be applicable\nhere.\n    First, these provisions, unlike the provision found unconstitutional in H unter\nv. Erickson, supra, do not contain a racial classification. Mandatory busing for\nthe purpose of achieving racial balance is only one of the circumstances in which\nstudent transportation is placed o ff limits to Justice Department suits or district\ncourt orders. The proposals prohibit Justice D epartment suits or court orders for\nthe transportation of students specified distances or away from the schools nearest\ntheir hom es for any reason. Moreover, a racial classification would not result even\nif these provisions limited advocacy or ordering of mandatory busing only to\nachieve racial integration. The issue o f what sorts of remedies the Justice\nD epartm ent should advocate or the federal district courts should order simply\ndoes not split the citizenry into discrete racial subgroups. Cf. Personnel Adm in­\nistrator v.

W hat­\never m ight be the arguable impact on racial m inorities, the legislative history to\ndate contains no suggestion o f an invidious discriminatory purpose. To the\ncontrary, the sponsors and supporters of these measures endorsed the decision in\nBrown v. B oard o f Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954), and repeatedly stated their\nabhorrence of de ju re segregation in schooling. The proponents rest their support\no f this legislation on the conclusion that busing has been destructive not only of\nquality education for all students but also of the goal of desegregation. Even the\nopponents of the bill did not suggest that any invidious purpose was present.\n    Accordingly, the bill will not be subject to review under the strict scrutiny\nstandard. Instead, the bill will be reviewed, and upheld, under the principles of\nequal protection, if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\nThis test is a highly deferential one. It is reasonably clear that the defects in\nbusing noted by the proponents o f the bill and discussed above would suffice to\nsatisfy the m inim um rationality standard. Moreover, the proponents of these\nprovisions advanced other rationales to support the measure, including that\nm andatory busing is an excessive burden on the taxpayer; that it wastes scarce\npetroleum reserves; and that education is a local matter that should be adm in­\nistered on a local level. These reasons appear to be legitimate governmental\npurposes, and the busing restrictions appear to be rationally related to these\npurposes.\n    It should be noted in closing that these conclusions are predicated in substan­\ntial part on the legislative history of this bill to date. Subsequent history in the\nH ouse or thereafter could well affect these views.\n\n                                                 Sincerely,\n                                                 W   il l ia m   F r e n c h S m it h\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f</pre>",
