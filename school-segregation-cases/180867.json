In 1992, McMaster filed an\napplication for a patent, having satisfied all of the\nrequirements for receiving a patent under the General Mining\nLaw of 1872. However, the Bureau of Land Management\n(“BLM”) granted McMaster a patent to only the mineral\nestate; the surface estate was reserved to the United States.\nMcMaster brought suit under the Quiet Title Act (“QTA”),\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and Declaratory\nJudgment Act (“DJA”), seeking to quiet fee-simple title to the\nOro Grande mining claim and its improvements. The district\ncourt dismissed all of McMaster’s claims under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n  We affirm the district court’s decision. We agree that the\nQTA is the exclusive means for McMaster to bring suit, and\n\f4              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nthus hold that the district court properly dismissed\nMcMaster’s APA and DJA claims. With regard to\nMcMaster’s QTA claims, we hold that McMaster did not\nhave a “valid existing right” to a fee-simple patent when he\nfiled his patent application, and that McMaster failed to plead\nwith particularity the circumstances under which title to the\nimprovements was acquired.\n\n      I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    Ken McMaster, Maureen E. Galitz, and Steven E. Fawl\n(collectively referred to as “McMaster”) own the Oro Grande\nmining claim. The Oro Grande “is an approximate[ly] 20-acre\nplacer mining claim located approximately 45 miles\nnorthwest of Redding, California, along the South Fork\nSalmon River in the Trinity Alps Wilderness.” The claim was\noriginally located in 1934, pursuant to the General Mining\nLaw of 1872.\n\n    In 1934, McMaster’s predecessors-in-interest purchased\nthe Oro Grande—formerly called the Conrad Bar placer\nmine—from the claim’s original locator, Edwin Lynch. The\nBill of Sale conveyed title to the mining claim and all\nimprovements, including a cabin and a shed. The claim was\nsubsequently “relocated” three times between 1934 and 1953.\nThe current configuration of the Oro Grande mining claim\nwas located on June 23, 1953, and the corresponding Notice\nof Location noted improvements made to the claim, including\na cabin and a shed. After a series of intestate successions and\nconveyances, the Oro Grande was conveyed to McMaster on\nApril 5, 1991. The 1991 Joint Tenancy Deed noted the cabin\nand shed as improvements.\n\f              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     5\n\n    McMaster actively mines the Oro Grande mining claim\nwhen conditions permit—“when the South Fork Salmon\nRiver level is low enough . . . and when access to the site is\npossible”—in compliance with state and federal law. There\nare now three structures on the Oro Grande mining claim,\nwhich are used in furtherance of mining operations: a cabin,\na workshop, and an outhouse. The cabin was built in the early\n1890s and is constructed of split logs and shakes. McMaster\nuses the workshop to process samples during the mining\nprocess and to store mining equipment during the seasons in\nwhich he is unable to mine.\n\n    On August 14, 1992, McMaster filed an application to\npatent the Oro Grande mining claim. On August 16, 1993, the\nBLM State Director for California certified that McMaster\nhad fully complied with the requirements of the 1872 Mining\nLaw and was entitled to the First Half Mineral Entry Final\nCertificate (“FHMEFC”), “confirming that mineral entry was\nallowed and occurred upon the date of acceptance of the\npurchase price.” The FHMEFC was issued by the Secretary\nof the Interior on December 1, 1994.\n\n    On August 4, 2000, the BLM issued a mineral report for\nthe Oro Grande mining claim, concluding, inter alia, “[t]hat\na discovery of a valuable mineral deposit of gold was made\non the Oro Grande mining claim at the time it was located in\n1953.” An early draft of the 2000 mineral report\nrecommended that the Oro Grande surface estate be patented\nalong with the mineral estate, but this recommendation was\nultimately revised based on an opinion issued on May 22,\n1998 by the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. See\nSolicitor’s Opinion M-36994, Patenting of Mining Claims\nand Mill Sites in Wilderness Areas (May 22, 1998)\n(“Solicitor’s Opinion”). A second mineral report for the Oro\n\f6              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nGrande mining claim was issued on April 10, 2006, and\nlikewise concluded that there was a discovery of a valuable\nmineral deposit and relied on the Solicitor’s Opinion to\nrecommend that only the mineral estate be patented.\n\n    On October 3, 2008, the BLM issued a patent for the Oro\nGrande mining claim. That patent was later cancelled to\ncorrect an error, and a new patent issued on February 10,\n2009. The patent conveyed only “the mineral deposits within\n[the] association placer mining claim known as the Oro\nGrande Mining Claim,” reserving “[a]ll title in or to the\nsurface estate and products thereof” and “[a] right-of-way\nthereon for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of\nthe United States” to the United States. Since the patent\nissued, the United States Forest Service has asserted that\nMcMaster “do[es] not own the structures located on the Oro\nGrande mining claim.”\n\n    On April 13, 2010, McMaster filed a complaint in federal\ndistrict court under the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2409a, to\nquiet title to fee-simple ownership of the longstanding mining\nstructures and improvements located on the Oro Grande\nmining claim. McMaster also brought a claim under the APA\nfor judicial review of the BLM’s action of issuing a patent\nconveying only the mineral estate. On June 30, 2010, the\nGovernment filed a motion to dismiss McMaster’s complaint\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district\ncourt granted the government’s motion, holding (1) that the\nQTA is the exclusive means for challenging the United\nStates’ title to real property, (2) that under the QTA,\nMcMaster “did not acquire any right to a patent until [he]\nfiled the[] patent application,” at which time McMaster was\nentitled to title to only the mineral estate, and (3) that under\nthe QTA, McMaster failed to “allege[] with particularity\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     7\n\nwhen and how [he] obtained ownership to the structures at\nissue.” McMaster was granted leave to amend his complaint.\n\n    On September 24, 2010, McMaster filed his First\nAmended Complaint, which added new claims under the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. The\ngovernment again filed a motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6), which the district court\ngranted, dismissing McMaster’s complaint with prejudice.\nThe district court concluded that it was barred from\nreconsidering McMaster’s APA claims by the law-of-the-case\ndoctrine. It also dismissed McMaster’s new DJA claims\nbecause it concluded that the QTA is the exclusive means for\nchallenging the United States’ interest in real property.\nRegarding McMaster’s QTA claims, the district court\nconcluded that McMaster had failed to remedy the problems\nthat the court had identified in its prior dismissal order.\nMcMaster timely appealed.\n\n              II.   LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory History\n\n     The General Mining Law of 1872 (“Mining Law”),\n30 U.S.C. § 22 et seq., was enacted to permit citizens to enter\nand explore unappropriated federal lands in search of\n“valuable mineral deposits,” id. § 22. Citizens who\ndiscovered mineral deposits could then secure exclusive\nrights to the land by meeting certain statutory requirements.\nId.; see Independence Min. Co., Inc. v. Babbitt, 105 F.3d 502,\n506 (9th Cir. 1997). First, a claimant could validate his claim\nby meeting the legal requirements for “locating” and\ndiscovering the claim. See 30 U.S.C. § 28; see also Cole v.\nRalph, 252 U.S. 286, 294–96 (1920). The holder of a valid,\n\f8              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nlocated claim is entitled to the “exclusive right of possession\nand enjoyment of all the surface included within the . . .\nlocation[],” as long as he continues to meet certain\nrequirements. 30 U.S.C. § 26; see id. § 28; see also Best v.\nHumboldt Placer Min. Co., 371 U.S. 334, 335–36 (1963).\nThis possessory interest entitles the claim holder to “the right\nto extract all minerals from the claim without paying royalties\nto the United States,” Independence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at\n506, but the United States retains title to the land, United\nStates v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 104 (1985). Second, “an\nindividual who possesses a valid mining claim may go\nthrough an additional process to obtain a patent,” by applying\nto the BLM, in the Department of the Interior, and meeting\nadditional statutory requirements. Swanson v. Babbitt, 3 F.3d\n1348, 1350 (9th Cir. 1993); see 30 U.S.C. §§ 29, 35;\nIndependence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at 506. Under the General\nMining Law, a patent generally conveyed fee-simple title to\nboth the surface estate and the mineral deposits. See\nIndependence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at 506; see also Andrus v.\nShell Oil Co., 446 U.S. 657, 658 & n.1 (1980).\n\n    In 1955, however, Congress enacted the Surface\nResources and Multiple Use Act, 30 U.S.C. § 601–615, which\nestablished that any unpatented claim located after the\neffective date of the Act could not be used “for any purposes\nother than prospecting, mining or processing operations and\nuses reasonable incident thereto,” id. § 612(a); see United\nStates v. Backlund, 689 F.3d 986, 991 (9th Cir. 2012).\nClaimants would no longer receive the exclusive right of\npossession and enjoyment of the surface prior to patenting\ntheir claim; their claims would be subject to “the right of the\nUnited States to manage and dispose” of the surface of any\nsuch mining claim. 30 U.S.C. § 612(b); see Backlund,\n689 F.3d at 991.\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     9\n\n    Then, in 1964, Congress enacted the Wilderness Act,\n16 U.S.C. §§ 1131–36, which “established the National\nWilderness Preservation System [(“NWPS”)] to be composed\nof federally owned areas designated by Congress as\n‘wilderness areas,’” id. § 1131(a). The stated purpose of the\nWilderness Act was to “secure for the American people of\npresent and future generations the benefits of an enduring\nresource of wilderness” by creating and administering\nwilderness areas “for the use and enjoyment of the American\npeople in such manner as will leave them unimpaired for\nfuture use and enjoyment as wilderness, and so as to provide\nfor the protection of these areas, [and] the preservation of\ntheir wilderness character.” Id. The Wilderness Act also\nrepresented a compromise between mining and preservation\ninterests. See Kenneth D. Hubbard et. al., The Wilderness\nAct’s Impact on Mining Activities: Policy Versus\nPractice, 76 Denv. U. L. Rev. 591, 591–92, 597 (1999).\nSection 1133(d)(3), in particular, was a product of this\ncompromise, see id. at 591–92; it limited the creation of\nfuture mining interests, while preserving some pre-existing\nmining interests and providing a grace period for discoveries.\nSee 16 U.S.C. § 1133(d)(3). “[S]ubject to valid existing\nrights,” patents that issued after the effective date of the\nWilderness Act, would convey title only to the mineral\ndeposits, with the surface estate being reserved to the United\nStates. Id. New claims could also be located under the Act,\nbut only until December 31, 1983. Id. After December 31,\n1983, no patent would issue to claims located within a\nwilderness area, “except for valid claims existing on or before\nDecember 31, 1983.” Id. And “[s]ubject to valid rights then\nexisting,” beginning on January 1, 1984, “all forms of\nappropriation under the mining laws” would no longer apply\nto any lands designated as wilderness areas. Id.\n\f10             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    Twenty years later, the California Wilderness Act of 1984\nmade the Wilderness Act applicable to the Oro Grande\nmining claim as of September 28, 1984. Pub. L. No. 98-425,\nTitle I, § 101(a)(34) (1984).\n\nB. Regulatory History\n\n    In 1966, the BLM promulgated a regulation to implement\n§ 1133(d)(3) of the Wilderness Act. See 43 C.F.R. § 3638.5\n(1996) (“the regulation”). The regulation states that any\n“patent issued under the U.S. mining laws for mineral\nlocations established after [the effective date of the\nWilderness Act], or validated by discovery of minerals\noccurring after [the effective date of the Wilderness Act],”\nwould convey title only to the mineral deposits and would\nreserve title to the surface of the land to the United States. Id.\nAlthough § 3638.5 does not directly address whether such a\nreservation of surface rights to the United States applied to\nunpatented claims located prior to the effective date of the\nWilderness Act, in practice, the BLM regularly conveyed fee-\nsimple patents to such claims. See Solicitor’s Opinion at 1,\n19–20. In 1981, the BLM also published a policy stating that\n“[a] patent conveying both surface and mineral rights may be\nissued on a valid claim located prior to the date the area was\nincluded as part of the National Wilderness Preservation\nSystem.” Bureau of Land Management, Wilderness\nManagement Policy, 46 Fed. Reg. 47,180-01 (1981) (“BLM\npolicy”) (emphasis added). And in 1991, the BLM issued a\nmanual stating that “[f]or claims located before enactment of\nthe Wilderness Act . . . the claims must have a discovery as\nof the date of enactment to acquire the surface and mineral\nestates,” BLM Manual H-3860-1, Mineral Patent Application\nProcessing, VIII-7 (1991) (“the Manual”).\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     11\n\n    On May 22, 1998, the Solicitor of the Department of the\nInterior issued Opinion No. M-36994 disagreeing with\nBLM’s practice of conveying fee-simple patents to all valid\nclaims located before the wilderness designation. See\nSolicitor’s Opinion at 20. The Solicitor’s Opinion recognized\nthe BLM’s policies and practices, see id. at 19–20, but\nultimately instructed the BLM to follow a new policy:\n\n       [M]ineral patents issued under the Mining\n       Law for lands within the wilderness areas . . .\n       should convey only the mineral deposits\n       within the claim, unless the mining claim for\n       which the patent is sought was located and\n       validated by a discovery prior to designation\n       of the wilderness area and the claimant\n       complied with all the requirements for\n       obtaining a patent under the Mining Law prior\n       to the wilderness designation, as determined\n       by the Secretary.\n\nId. at 21. This interpretation specified that the new policy\nshould “be applied to . . . currently pending applications.” Id.\n\n                    III.   DISCUSSION\n\n    McMaster appeals the district court’s dismissal of his\nQTA, APA, and DJA claims, arguing that he is entitled to\nfee-simple title to the surface estate of his claim. “We review\nde novo the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).”\nStone v. Travelers Corp., 58 F.3d 434, 436–37 (9th Cir.\n1995). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nA. QTA Claims\n\f12             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    McMaster raised two independent QTA claims: (1) that\nthe QTA required the government to convey fee-simple\nownership of surface and mineral estates of the Oro Grande\nmining claim to McMaster; and (2) that McMaster properly\nholds title to all improvements and structures located on the\nOro Grande mining claim. We consider each in turn.\n\n     1. Fee-simple title to Oro Grande mining claim\n\n    In dismissing McMaster’s first QTA claim, the district\ncourt held pursuant to the Wilderness Act that McMaster did\nnot have a “‘valid existing right’ to a patent conveying fee-\nsimple ownership of the surface estate and structures\nassociated with [its] mining claim.” The relevant portion of\nthe Wilderness Act states:\n\n        [H]ereafter, subject to valid existing rights, all\n        patents issued under the mining laws of the\n        United States affecting national forest lands\n        designated by this chapter as wilderness areas\n        shall convey title to the mineral deposits\n        within the claim . . . , but each such patent\n        shall reserve to the United States all title in or\n        to the surface of the lands and products\n        thereof, and no use of the surface of the claim\n        or the resources therefrom not reasonably\n        required for carrying on mining or prospecting\n        shall be allowed except as otherwise expressly\n        provided in this chapter: Provided, That,\n        unless hereafter specifically authorized, no\n        patent within wilderness areas designated by\n        this chapter shall issue after December 31,\n        1983, except for the valid claims existing on\n        or before December 31, 1983. Mining claims\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                      13\n\n        located after September 3, 1964, within the\n        boundaries of wilderness areas designated by\n        this chapter shall create no rights in excess of\n        those rights which may be patented under the\n        provisions of this subsection.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1133(d)(3) (emphases added).\n\n     McMaster argues that in passing the Wilderness Act,\nCongress intended for claimants to receive fee-simple title to\ntheir pre-existing valid claims. More specifically, McMaster\ncontends that the “valid existing rights” language of the\nWilderness Act protects claimants’ legitimate expectations of\nfee-simple title, preserving the right to the surface estate for\nall those who had properly located a mining claim prior to the\nrelevant wilderness designation.\n\n    McMaster claims that the BLM’s regulation, policy, and\nmanual are consistent with its interpretation and should have\nbeen applied to McMaster’s claim, and that the Solicitor’s\nOpinion, which is contrary to McMaster’s interpretation, is\nnot entitled to any deference.\n\n        a. BLM’s regulation, Manual, and BLM policy\n\n     McMaster argues that the regulation, Manual, and BLM\npolicy are consistent with his interpretation and require that\nMcMaster be issued a fee-simple patent. None of these,\nhowever, clearly requires issuing title to the surface estate for\nall valid claims.\n\n    First, the regulation contained in 43 C.F.R. § 3638.5 states\nthat for “mineral locations established after [the effective date\nof the Wilderness Act], or validated by discovery of minerals\n\f14             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\noccurring after [the effective date of the Wilderness Act],”\ntitle will issue to only the mineral deposits; the United States\nwill retain title to the surface of the land. 43 C.F.R. § 3638.5.\nSection 3638.5 does not even address claims that were\nestablished prior to the effective date of the Wilderness Act.\nAnd stating that claims discovered after the effective date of\nthe Act receive only limited patents does not necessarily\nmean that every valid claim located prior to the time\nannounced in the Regulation is entitled to a fee-simple patent.\n\n    In contrast to the regulation, the Manual addresses claims\nthat were established prior to the wilderness designation. The\nManual states that “[f]or claims located before enactment of\nthe Wilderness Act . . . the claims must have a discovery as\nof the date of enactment to acquire the surface and mineral\nestates,” BLM Manual H-3860-1, Mineral Patent Application\nProcessing, VIII-7 (Apr 17, 1991). Although the Manual\nindicates that a claim must be discovered prior to the\nwilderness designation to receive title to the surface estate,\nnowhere does the manual state that this is all that is required.\nIndeed, discovery is a necessary, but not a sufficient,\ncondition for establishing a valid claim; the claim must also\nbe located “by reference to some natural object or permanent\nmonument as will identify the claim.” 30 U.S.C. § 28; see\nCole, 252 U.S. at 296. Moreover, even if the Manual could be\nread as stating that valid claims established before the\nwilderness designation are entitled to title to the surface state,\nBLM manuals are not legally binding. See Schweiker v.\nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 789–90 (1981) (holding that a Social\nSecurity manual did not bind the Social Security\nAdministration because it is not a regulation and has “no legal\nforce”); Robert S. Glenn DeLloyd Cazier, 124 IBLA 104, 109\n(IBLA 1992) (“Instruction Memoranda and BLM Manual\nprovisions do not have the force and effect of law and are not\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     15\n\nbinding on either this Board or the public at large.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n    Finally, the BLM policy states that “[a] patent conveying\nboth surface and mineral rights may be issued on a valid\nclaim located prior to the date the area was included as part\nof the National Wilderness Preservation System.” Bureau of\nLand Management, Wilderness Management Policy, 46 Fed.\nReg. 47,180-01 (1981) (emphasis added). Although the BLM\npolicy indicates more clearly that valid claims may receive\nfee-simple title, the language of the policy is discretionary\n(“may be issued”). The policy thus leaves room for BLM to\nimpose additional requirements for receiving fee-simple title.\nAnd, in any event, like the Manual, a BLM management\npolicy is not legally binding. See King’s Meadow Ranches,\n126 IBLA 339, 341 n.2 (IBLA 1993) (stating that policies\n“not established by regulation . . . lack[] the force and effect\nof law”); see also Schweiker, 450 U.S. at 789–90.\n\n    Thus, neither the regulation, nor the Manual, nor the BLM\npolicy entitles McMaster to fee-simple title to the surface\nestate.\n\n       b. The Solicitor’s Opinion\n\n     In contrast to McMaster’s interpretation of “valid existing\nrights,” the Solicitor’s Opinion concluded that the term refers\nto a claimant who had actually “filed a patent application, and\nestablished a right to a patent before the land in question was\ndesignated as wilderness” by “complying with all the\nrequirements for obtaining a patent.” Solicitor’s Opinion at 3,\n21. Under this reading, the Wilderness Act does not preserve\na right to a surface estate for those who “located a mining\nclaim and made a discovery of a valuable mineral claim\n\f16             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\ndeposit before the land in question was designated as\nwilderness, but . . . had not established a right to a patent\nbefore the land was designated as wilderness.” Id. at 3–4.\nSince the Solicitor’s Opinion is contrary to McMaster’s\ninterpretation of the statute, we must determine whether it is\nowed deference.\n\n           i. Chevron deference\n\n     Under Chevron, we conduct a two-step inquiry to\ndetermine whether an agency interpretation warrants\ndeference. At step one, we ask “whether Congress has\ndirectly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Chevron\nU.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n842 (1984). “If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end\nof the matter; [and we] . . . must give effect to the\nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id. at 842–43.\nIf, however, “the statute is silent or ambiguous,” id. at 843,\nprior to step two, “we must decide how much weight to\naccord an agency’s interpretation,” Tualatin Valley Builders\nSupply, Inc. v. United States, 522 F.3d 937, 940 (9th Cir.\n2008); see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218,\n227–28 (2001); N. Cal. River Watch v. Wilcox, 633 F.3d 766,\n772–73 (9th Cir. 2010). If we determine that Chevron\ndeference applies, then we move to step two, where we will\ndefer to the agency’s interpretation if it is “based on a\npermissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n843.\n\n   First, we hold that the meaning of “valid existing rights”\nin § 1133(d)(3) is ambiguous under Chevron step one.\nSection 1133(d)(3) clearly excepts “valid existing rights”\nfrom its mandate that patents should be issued to only the\nmineral estate; but what constitutes a “valid existing right[]”\n\f                MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                       17\n\nis not clear from the text; the term is undefined. See Chevron,\n467 U.S. at 842–43. The contrasting interpretations that\nMcMaster and the government offer for “valid existing\nrights” demonstrate the ambiguity inherent in the term. As\nexplained, McMaster argues that “valid existing rights”\npreserves the right to the surface estate for all those who had\nproperly located a mining claim prior to the relevant\nwilderness designation because they had a legitimate\nexpectation that they would receive title. In contrast, the\ngovernment argues that “valid existing rights” are akin to\n“vested rights,” and Congress retains the authority to limit\nand regulate a preexisting mining claimant’s opportunity to\nobtain a patent. Courts that have interpreted the term “valid\nexisting rights” within the context of other statutes have\nsometimes defined the term in accordance with the\ngovernment’s definition, see, e.g., Alaska Miners v. Andrus,\n662 F.2d 577, 579–80 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding that a plaintiff\nwith valid claim did not have a “valid existing right” to a\npatent “prior to the payment of any money for the granting of\nthe patent for the land”); Freese v. United States, 639 F.2d\n754, 758 (Ct. Cl. 1981) (holding that claimant who was\ndenied a patent had his “valid existing rights” preserved and\nthat “[t]he law is well-settled that [a] vested right [to a] patent\ndoes not arise until there has been full compliance with the\nextensive procedures . . . for the obtaining of a patent”).\nOther times courts have arguably interpreted the term in a\nmanner consistent with McMaster’s definition, see, e.g.,\nAleknagik Natives Ltd. v. United States, 806 F.2d 924,\n926–27 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that “‘valid existing rights’\ndoes not necessarily mean vested rights[;] . . . legitimate\nexpectations may be recognized as valid existing rights,\nespecially where the expectancy is created by the government\nin the first instance”); Seldovia Native Ass’n, Inc. v. Lujan,\n904 F.2d 1335, 1343 (9th Cir. 1990) (applying Aleknagik); cf.\n\f18                MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nE. Cent. Eureka Mining Co. v. Cent. Eureka Mining Co.,\n204 U.S. 266, 269–70, (1907) (holding that the phrase “rights\nor interests . . . under existing laws” included “inchoate\nrights”).\n\n    In addition, the District of Columbia Circuit has\nspecifically held that the phrase “subject to valid existing\nrights,” as contained in a different statute, is ambiguous under\nChevron step one. See Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. Kempthorne,\n512 F.3d 702, 707–08 (D.C. Cir. 2008).1 Moreover, with\nregard to the Wilderness Act in particular, the fact that the\nDepartment of the Interior has changed its practice—and as\nMcMaster argues, also its written policies and regulations2—\nwith regard to what constitutes a “valid existing right” also\nsupports our conclusion that the term is ambiguous. See\nSolicitor’s Opinion at 19–20.\n\n    Since we conclude that the meaning of “valid existing\nrights” in § 1133(d)(3) is ambiguous under Chevron step one,\nwe must determine how much weight to afford the agency\ninterpretation before moving to step two. See Tualatin Valley\n\n  1\n    The statute at issue in Nat’l Mining Ass’n was the Surface Mining\nControl and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”). The Office of Surface\nMining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”) has stated that “valid\nexisting rights” under SMCRA “is not analogous to [‘valid existing\nrights’] under other Federal statutes,” Valid Existing Rights, 64 Fed. Reg.\n70766-01 (Dec 17, 1999), including our interpretation of “valid existing”\nrights in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. See Aleknagik,\n806 F.2d at 926–27. This further illustrates the ambiguity in the term.\n  2\n   As explained, although the BLM had a practice of issuing fee-simple\npatents to claimants who had located their claims prior to the wilderness\ndesignation, see Solicitor’s Opinion at 19–20, its written policies and\nregulation were arguably not clear as to whether a fee-simple patent must\nalways issue to a claimant in McMaster’s position.\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                               19\n\nBuilders, 522 F.3d at 940; see also Mead, 533 U.S. at\n227–28; Wilcox, 633 F.3d at 772–73. Chevron deference\napplies only when (1) “it appears that Congress delegated\nauthority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the\nforce of law,” and (2) “the agency interpretation claiming\ndeference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.”\nMead, 533 U.S. at 226–27.\n\n     Although it seems clear that Congress has explicitly\ndelegated authority to the Secretary of the Interior to\nprescribe regulations relating to the operation of the Mining\nLaw and the issuance of patents, see 30 U.S.C. § 22;\n43 U.S.C. § 2,3 the Solicitor’s Opinion was not “promulgated\nin the exercise of [the Department’s] authority” to issue\nregulations regarding public lands. Mead, 533 U.S. at\n226–27. The Supreme Court has stated that “[i]nterpretations\nsuch as those in opinion letters which lack the force of law[]\ndo not warrant Chevron-style deference,” Christensen v.\nHarris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000), and we have relied\non Christensen to broadly conclude that “Solicitor’s opinions\n. . . cannot properly be viewed as an administrative agency\ninterpretation of statute that has the force of law.” The\n\n\n  3\n    Congress has specified that citizens seeking to acquire title to mining\nclaims must follow “regulations prescribed by law,” 30 U.S.C. § 22, and\nhas made clear that the “Secretary of the Interior . . . shall perform all\nexecutive duties appertaining to the . . . sale of the public lands of the\nUnited States, or in anywise respecting such public lands, and, also, such\nas relate to private claims of land, and the issuing of patents for all grants\nof land under the authority of the Government.” 43 U.S.C. § 2. The\nSupreme Court has confirmed that these statutes make clear that “the\nDepartment [of the Interior] has been granted plenary authority over the\nadministration of public lands, including mineral lands; and it has been\ngiven broad authority to issue regulations concerning them.” Best,\n371 U.S. at 336–37.\n\f20                MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nWilderness Soc’y v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 353 F.3d\n1051, 1068 n. 16 (9th Cir. 2003), amended on reh’g en banc\nby 360 F.3d 1374 (9th Cir. 2004).4 Thus, the Solicitor’s\nOpinion does not warrant Chevron deference.\n\n              ii. Skidmore deference\n\n 4\n   Wilderness Soc’y declares that Solicitor’s Opinions, as a class, are not\nentitled to Chevron deference because “[s]uch opinions . . . normally are\nthe product of individual lawyers advising their client agencies . . . [and]\ndo not . . . involve procedural protections comparable to an agency’s\nrulemaking procedures.” Id. at 1068 n.16. But see Mead, 533 U.S. at\n230–31. If we were deciding the issue on a blank slate we might come out\nsomewhat differently. The Solicitor Opinion at issue in Wilderness Soc’y\naddressed a specific project in Alaska, “d[id] not attempt to draw broader\nconclusions regarding the permissibility of th[e] type of enterprise [at\nissue],” and “was not a document intended to have the general force of\nlaw.” Id. at 1068. In contrast, here, the Solicitor’s Opinion was arguably\nissued with a “lawmaking pretense.” Marmolejo-Campos v. Holder,\n558 F.3d 903, 908–09 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc). The Opinion’s\ninterpretation of “valid existing rights” applies to an entire class of claims,\nand the Opinion itself specifically requires the BLM to “amend its\nregulations . . . and its Manual . . . to comport with th[e] Opinion,” and to\napply the Opinion to “all new and currently pending patent applications.”\nSolicitor’s Opinion at 21–22. Moreover, Solicitor Opinions, generally,\nhave “precedential value”—they “bind future parties.” Marmolejo-\nCampos, 558 F.3d at 909. Solicitor’s Opinions are binding on the Interior\nBoard of Land Appeals (“IBLA”), an appellate body that hears appeals\nfrom BLM decisions. See Solicitor’s Opinion M-37003, Binding Nature\nof Solicitor’s Opinions on the Office of Hearings and Appeals (Jan. 18,\n2001); United States v. Rannells, 175 IBLA 363, 377 n.3 (IBLA 2008).\nIndeed, it seems to be somewhat of an anomaly that we have concluded\nthat IBLA opinions are entitled to Chevron deference, see\nBrandt-Erichsen v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, Bureau of Land Mgmt.,\n999 F.2d 1376, 1381 (9th Cir. 1993), but Solicitor Opinions, which are\nbinding on the IBLA and can overrule IBLA decisions are not, see\n43 C.F.R. 4.5(a). But, since we ultimately conclude that the Solicitor’s\nOpinion is entitled to Skidmore deference, the question of whether\nChevron applies is not determinative in this case.\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                    21\n\n    An agency action that does not warrant Chevron\ndeference may still warrant “respect proportional to its\n‘power to persuade.’” Mead, 533 U.S. at 235 (quoting\nSkidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)). Under\nSkidmore, “[t]he weight of such a judgment in a particular\ncase will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its\nconsideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency\nwith earlier and later pronouncements, and [any other] factors\nwhich give it power to persuade.” Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.\n\n    We conclude that the Solicitor’s Opinion is entitled to\nrespect under Skidmore. It is a well-reasoned, formal, signed,\ntwenty-two page opinion, see Solicitor’s Opinion at 1–22,\nthat is “thorough[] . . . in its consideration,” and ultimately\npersuasive. Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.\n\n    McMaster argues that the Solicitor’s opinion is\ninconsistent “with earlier . . . pronouncements.” For the\nreasons explained earlier, the Solicitor’s Opinion was not\nclearly contrary to the regulation or, arguably, the Manual,\nalthough it does appear to be in tension with the prior BLM\npolicy (though the policy still left the agency room for\ndiscretion). To the extent there is any inconsistency, however,\nthis is just one factor under Skidmore. The Solicitor’s Opinion\nalso carefully analyzes the text, purpose, and legislative\nhistory of the Wilderness Act, as well as the “modern judicial\ntreatment of valid existing rights with respect to legislation\naffecting mining claims and patents.” Solicitor’s Opinion at\n1–16. In sum, the Solicitor’s Opinion is a “persuasive\ninterpretation of the law,” Tualatin Valley Builders, 522 F.3d\n\f22                 MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nat 942, despite the fact that it arguably represents a change in\nthe agency’s view.5\n\n    First, the Solicitor’s Opinion’s reading of “valid existing\nrights” is consistent with the text of § 1133(d)(3). Section\n1133(d)(3) states that “hereafter, subject to valid existing\nrights, all patents issued under the mining laws of the United\nStates affecting national forest lands designated by this\nchapter as wilderness areas shall convey title to the mineral\ndeposits within the claim.” Because the phrase “subject to\nvalid existing rights” clearly refers to the issuance of a\nlimited patent to the mineral estate, “valid existing rights”\nmust refer to a claimant’s valid existing right to a patent—not\nmerely a valid claim. See Solicitor’s Opinion at 5 (“[T]he\nphrase ‘valid existing rights’ must refer only to a claimant’s\nvalid existing rights to a patent.”). Moreover, as the\nSolicitor’s Opinion points out, see Solicitor’s Opinion at 6,\n§ 1133(d)(3) references both “valid existing rights” and\n“valid claims.” By virtue of the fact that Congress used both\nof these phrases in the same section of a statute, we infer that\nCongress intended different meanings. SEC v. McCarthy,\n322 F.3d 650, 656 (9th Cir. 2003) (“It is a well-established\n\n  5\n     To the extent that McMaster argues that the Solicitor’s Opinion is\narbitrary and capricious because it represented a “reversal of agency\npolicy” or a “change from agency practice,” McMaster’s argument\nfails. Agency inconsistency is “at most” a reason for concluding that an\naction is arbitrary and capricious only when the change in position is\ninadequately explained. Nat’l Cable & Telecomm. Ass’n v. Brand X\nInternet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 981–82 (2005); cf. id. at 981 (explaining\nthat Chevron still applied to an inconsistent policy because “[a]n initial\nagency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone[;] . . . the agency . . .\nmust consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a\ncontinuing basis”). Here, the change in the agency’s practice was not\nunexplained. The Solicitor Opinion clearly, and rather extensively, stated\nthe reasons supporting its interpretation.\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     23\n\ncanon of statutory interpretation that the use of different\nwords or terms within a statute demonstrates that Congress\nintended to convey a different meaning for those words.”).\nThus, the exception of “valid existing rights” from\n§ 1133(d)’s requirement that the surface estate be reserved to\nthe government cannot mean that any “valid claim” is\nexcepted from the requirement that the surface estate be\nreserved. “Valid existing rights” must mean something\ndifferent.\n\n    The Solicitor Opinion’s reading is also consistent with the\npurpose of the Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act was\nenacted to “secure for the American people of present and\nfuture generations the benefits of an enduring resource of\nwilderness” by creating and administering wilderness areas\n“for the use and enjoyment of the American people in such\nmanner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and\nenjoyment as wilderness, and so as to provide for the\nprotection of these areas, [and] the preservation of their\nwilderness character.” 16 U.S.C. § 1131(a). As the Solicitor’s\nOpinion explains, reading “valid existing rights” narrowly, so\nas to require more than a mere “valid claim,” helps to\n“maximize protection of the wilderness” and is consistent\nwith the Act’s “protective thrust.” Solicitor’s Opinion at 7.\nAlthough, to some extent, § 1133(d)(3) also represented a\ncompromise between mining and preservation interests, see\nHubbard, 76 Denv. U. L. Rev. at 597, construing “valid\nexisting rights” in this manner does not interfere with mining\ninterests. A fee-simple patent is not necessary for mining to\ncontinue. See Independence Min. Co, 105 F.3d at 509 (stating\nthat a miner “need not obtain patents to continue its mining\noperation”). The holder of a valid, located claim is entitled to\nthe “exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the\nsurface included within the . . . location[],” 30 U.S.C. § 26;\n\f24             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nsee id. § 28; see also Best, 371 U.S. at 335, and has “the right\nto extract all minerals from the claim without paying royalties\nto the United States,” Independence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at\n506 (internal citation omitted).\n\n    In addition to being consistent with the text and purpose\nof the Wilderness Act, the Solicitor’s Opinion is also in\nharmony with precedent. For example, in Alaska Miners v.\nAndrus, claimants challenged a provision of the Alaska\nNative Claims Settlement Act (“ANCSA”), 43 U.S.C. § 1601\net seq., which limited the issuance of patents to those with\nvalid claims who complied with the mining laws and applied\nfor a patent within a five year period. See Alaska Miners,\n662 F.2d at 579–80; see also 43 U.S.C. § 1621(c). ANCSA\nprovided that “[a]ll conveyances . . . shall be subject to valid\nexisting rights,” 43 U.S.C. § 1613(g) (emphasis added); see\nalso Alaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579–80. The claimants\nargued that miners with valid claims “have a valid existing\nright to require the government to hold open indefinitely the\noption to apply for a patent,” Alaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579,\nessentially the same argument McMaster makes here. We\nheld that:\n\n        Appellants ha[d] no such right to a patent or\n        to the opportunity to apply for a patent outside\n        of the time restriction [mandated by the Act].\n        Appellants may well have an existing right to\n        prevent third parties from interfering with\n        their possessory interest. However, they have\n        no right to prevent the government from\n        conveying the legal title to the native\n        corporations.\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                                25\n\nId. Moreover, we reasoned that “the interest of a claimant in\na mining claim, prior to the payment of any money for the\ngranting of the patent for the land, is nothing more than a\nright to the exclusive possession of the land based upon\nconditions subsequent, a failure to fulfill which forfeits the\nlocator’s interest in the claim.” Id. (emphasis added).6\n\n    The U.S. Court of Claims has similarly held that the\nowner of a valid but unpatented mining claim had no right to\nreceive a patent because he “had not yet taken the first step\ntowards obtaining patents.” Freese, 639 F.2d at 758. In\nresponse to the claimant’s argument that “his right to the\nissuance of a patent upon each of his mining claims vested as\nsoon as he completed the discovery and location of each\nclaim,” the court explained that “[t]he law is well-settled that\n[a] vested right [to a patent] does not arise until there has\nbeen full compliance with the extensive procedures set forth\nin the federal mining laws for the obtaining of a patent.” Id.;\nsee also Cook v. United States, 37 Fed. Cl. 435, 445–46 (Fed.\nCl. 1997) (holding that plaintiffs were “entitle[d] to a patent”\nand had a vested property interest once they did “all that\n[was] required . . . under existing law to receive title to public\n\n\n   6\n      East Central Eureka Mining Co. v. Central Eureka Mining Co.,\n204 U.S. 266, 269–71, (1907), is not to the contrary. In East Central, the\nstatutory language at issue was broader than “valid existing rights”—the\nsavings clause referred to “rights or interests in mining property acquired\nunder existing laws.” Id. at 270. The Court also concluded that\n“rights”meant rights in the “popular” sense, rather than “technical[] legal\nsense.” Id. at 271. In contrast, here, “valid existing rights” has been treated\nas a technical, legal term that has been subjected to precise interpretations\nby courts and agencies. See, e.g., Valid Existing Rights, 64 Fed. Reg.\n70766-01 (Dec 17, 1999); Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 512 F.3d at 707–08;\nAleknagik, 806 F.2d at 926–27; Alaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579–80;\nFreese, 639 F.2d at 758.\n\f26                 MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nland, including the filing of all papers and, where applicable,\nthe payment to the United States of the purchase price for a\npatent”). The court also explained that the claimant’s “‘valid\nexisting rights’ in his mining claims [were] . . . preserved,”\ndespite the fact that the claimant was completely denied a\npatent, because the claimant’s “rights of use, enjoyment and\ndisposition in his unpatented mining claims remain[ed]\nundiminished.” Freese, 639 at 758.\n\n    Although we previously held in Aleknagik, with regard to\na different statute, that it was reasonable for an agency to\ninterpret “valid existing rights” “to mean something other\nthan ‘vested’” where plaintiffs had a “legitimate claim” and\nthe government represented that claimants had a right to that\nclaim, 806 F.2d at 926–27,7 no such representation has been\nmade to individuals in McMaster’s situation. We reasoned in\nAleknagik that “legitimate expectations may be recognized as\nvalid existing rights, especially where the expectancy is\ncreated by the government in the first instance.” Id. at 927.\nHere, however, individuals with valid claims who have not\neven filed a patent application do not have a “legitimate\nexpectation” of receiving fee-simple title. They have not yet\ncompleted even the “first step” of the process of applying for\na patent—in contrast to the claimants in Aleknagik. Id. at 926;\nsee 30 U.S.C. § 29. Nor has McMaster claimed that the\ngovernment has somehow represented to individuals with\n\n     7\n     We applied Aleknagik to the ANCSA in Seldovia Native Ass’n,\n904 F.2d at 1343. There we held that conditional purchase options granted\nunder the Alaska Statehood Act “satisfy the requirements of a valid\nexisting right. Because they are granted by the State of Alaska pursuant\nto an Act of Congress, they create legitimate expectations of property\ninterests. In addition, they are rights leading to the acquisition of title.” Id.\nSeldovia is also distinguishable from this case because the claimant had\na legitimate expectation that was clearly created by an Act of Congress.\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                             27\n\nvalid claims that they have a right to fee-simple title.8 Rather,\nthe Mining Act indicates that an individual with a valid claim\nwill have an opportunity to apply for a patent and may\nreceive one if he can meet the statute’s requirements. See\n30 U.S.C. § 29.\n\n    Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that “[a]lthough\nowners of unpatented mining claims hold fully recognized\npossessory interests in their claims, . . . these interests are a\n‘unique form of property.’ The United States, as owner of the\nunderlying fee title to the public domain, maintains broad\npowers over the terms and conditions upon which the public\nlands can be used, leased, and acquired.” Locke, 471 U.S. at\n104 (citations omitted).9 Indeed, we held in Swanson v.\nBabbitt that “[u]ntil a patent is issued, the government has\nbroad authority to manage public lands” and “to remove those\npublic lands from mining claims and patents,” 3 F.3d at 1352.\nThus, individuals such as McMaster, who have only a valid\n\n\n 8\n   By contrast, the government’s conduct in Aleknagik suggested that the\nclaimants—occupants of a townsite—had a right to fee-simple title. At the\nAleknagik claimants’ request, BLM had already completed a preliminary\nprocess for forming a townsite, called “segregation.” 806 F.2d at 925.\nHere, the government has not undertaken any steps to patent the claims\nbecause McMaster has not filed the initial application. Nor has the\ngovernment explicitly represented through its policies that all valid claims\nestablished before the effective date will receive fee-simple title. As\nexplained, neither the regulation, nor the Manual, nor the BLM policy\nclearly require all valid claims to be patented.\n  9\n    Contrary to McMaster’s contentions, the Solicitor’s interpretation is\nalso consistent with Stockley v. United States, 260 U.S. 532 (1923). In\nStockley, the Court said that “‘existing valid claims’ [o]bviously means\nsomething less than a vested right.” Id. at 544. Similarly, the Solicitor\ninterpreted “valid existing rights” to mean something more than an\n“existing valid claim.” See Solicitor’s Opinion at 6.\n\f28             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nclaim, do not have a legitimate expectation of receiving a\npatent.\n\n    Finally, the Solicitor’s Opinion also addressed the\nlegislative history to the Wilderness Act. The Opinion\ndiscusses a letter to the House of Representatives from\nAssistant Secretary of the Interior, John A. Carver, Jr.,which\nsuggested adding the language “subject to valid existing\nrights.” H. Rep. No. 88-1538 (1964), reprinted in 1964\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3615. The letter explained:\n\n       The requirement of the bill that all patents\n       issued after the effective date of this act shall\n       convey title to mineral deposits with a\n       reservation to the United States of all title to\n       the surface of the lands must be subject to\n       ‘valid existing rights.” The owner of a valid\n       mining claim perfected under the mining laws\n       prior to the effective date of this act has\n       already acquired a possessory title to the\n       surface of the land and any patent issued on\n       such a claim after the effective date of this act\n       must convey title to both the land and mineral\n       deposits therein, unless provision is made for\n       just compensation.\n\nId. at 3625. Although the letter states that a patent conveying\nfee-simple title “must” issue to the “owner of a valid mining\nclaim perfected under the mining laws prior to the effective\ndate of th[e] act” because the owner has “already acquired a\npossessory title to the surface of the land,” Carver does not\nprovide a legal basis for this assertion. See Solicitor Opinion\nat 9–10. Carver’s reference to “just compensation,” however,\nimplies that his rationale for the amendment is based, at least\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                    29\n\nin part, on avoiding compensable takings. See H. Rep. No.\n88-1538 (1964), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3615, 3625.\nViewed in that context, Carver’s interpretation is an incorrect\nstatement of the law. We have held that just compensation is\nrequired only when the claimant has a vested property right,\nsee Acton v. United States, 401 F.2d 896, 899 (9th Cir. 1968),\nwhich requires more than a valid claim and a possessory\ninterest, see Swanson, 3 F.3d at 1348 (holding that a “vested\nright does not arise until there has been full compliance with\nthe extensive procedures set forth in the federal mining laws\nfor the obtaining of a patent” (citation omitted)); see also\nAlaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579–80.\n\n    In addition to the Carver letter, the Solicitor’s Opinion\nalso discusses the House Committee Report, which was\napparently based on the Carver letter. Solicitor’s Opinion\nat 8. The House Report states that § 1133(d)(3)’s limitation\nof surface rights would apply to “locators of claims staked\nafter the effective date of the act.” H. Rep. No. 88-1538\n(1964), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3615, 3618.\n(emphasis added). As the Solicitor’s Opinion pointed out, this\nstatement is somewhat inconsistent with Carver’s\ninterpretation of the savings clause—those who have merely\nstaked a claim do not yet have a valid claim with a present\npossessory interest. Solicitor’s Opinion at 10.\n\n     We agree with the Solicitor’s Opinion that to the extent\nthat the Carver letter or House Report implied that “owners\nof valid mining claims[, or staked claims,] have, without\nmore, vested rights to a patent including the surface as well\nas the mineral deposits, [that] viewpoint is less persuasive,”\nsee Solicitor’s Opinion at 9, particularly since the Carver\nletter and House Report are somewhat inconsistent in their\ninterpretation of “valid existing rights.” Moreover, the Carver\n\f30                MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nand House Report interpretations are also inconsistent with\nthe text and purpose of the Wilderness Act, as well as\nrelevant case law, as has been explained. We find the\nSolicitor Opinion’s conclusion with regard to the legislative\nhistory convincing: The “valid existing rights” provision is\n“best viewed as responsive to the general constitutional\nconcern the Assistant Secretary raised, rather than as\nlegislating any precise understanding of the scope of those\nrights.” Id. at 10. “[T]he suggestions offered in both the\nCarver letter and the House Committee Report . . . should not\n. . . be regarded as enacting into law a particular view of valid\nexisting rights. Instead, by using such a general, common\nphrase, Congress was leaving it ultimately up to the courts to\ndetermine what ‘valid existing rights’ meant in the patenting\ncontext.” Id.\n\n    In sum, because the Solicitor’s Opinion is consistent with\nthe text of the statute, purpose, and our prior precedent, and\nbecause it adequately discussed and explained legislative\nhistory that could be perceived contrary to its interpretation,\nwe find the Solicitor’s Opinion to be persuasive. We therefore\nconclude that the Solicitor Opinion’s interpretation of “valid\nexisting rights” is entitled to Skidmore deference.\n\n              iii. Application\n\n    Applying the rule set forth in the Solicitor’s Opinion to\nthe facts of this case,10 it is undisputed that as of the effective\n\n\n 10\n    McMaster argues that the rule set forth in the Solicitor’s Opinion has\nan impermissible retroactive effect as applied to its case. See Solicitor’s\nOpinion at 21 (stating that the Opinion should be applied to all “currently\npending patent applications”). Although “retroactivity is not favored in the\nlaw,” and an agency does not have “power to promulgate retroactive rules\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                               31\n\ndate of the California Wilderness Act—September 28,\n1984—McMaster had nothing more than a valid claim in the\nOro Grande. McMaster did not fulfill the requirements for\nprocuring a patent until at least August 14, 1992. Therefore,\nMcMaster did not have a “valid existing right” to a fee-\nsimple patent under the Wilderness Act at the time that he\nsubmitted its patent application, and was properly granted a\npatent with reservation of the surface estates. McMaster’s\nonly “valid existing right” was to a claim, not a patent. The\ndistrict court did not err in dismissing McMaster’s first QTA\nclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n    2. Fee-simple title to mining structures                             and\n       improvements on Oro Grande mining claim\n\n    McMaster argues that he properly holds title to all\nimprovements and structures located on the Oro Grande\nmining claim because “[i]t is well established that mining\nstructures incident to mining operations may be erected on\nvalid claims,” and “the mining structures [here] were\nconstructed expressly for the benefit of the Oro Grande, and\nbecause they are . . . incident to mining the valuable mineral\ndeposits that were granted in the limited patent, the structures\nare ‘appurtenances’ and were also granted to [McMaster].”\n\n\nunless that power is conveyed by Congress in express terms,” Bowen v.\nGeorgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988), the rule set forth in\nthe Solicitor’s Opinion does not give the statute retroactive effect. The\nSolicitor’s interpretation “does not impact [McMaster’s] current\npossessory interest in the claims, but rather affects only its prospective\ninterest in further property rights in the claims.” R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v.\nBabbitt, 113 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 1997); see Freese, 639 F.2d at 758\n(“At best,” plaintiff, who had a valid claim and was denied an opportunity\nto apply for a patent, “suffered a denial of the opportunity to obtain greater\nproperty than that which he owned . . . .”).\n\f32               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    To invoke the QTA, a complaint must “set forth with\nparticularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the\nplaintiff claims in the real property, the circumstances under\nwhich it was acquired, and the right, title, or interest claimed\nby the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(d). We have not\npreviously considered what it means to “set forth with\nparticularity” in the context of § 2409a(d). In another context,\nhowever, this court has interpreted Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 9(b)’s requirement that fraud be pled with\nparticularity to require “[t]he complaint [to] specify such\nfacts as the times, dates, places, benefits received, and other\ndetails of the alleged fraudulent activity.” Neubronner v.\nMilken, 6 F.3d 666, 671–72 (9th Cir. 1993) (“A pleading is\nsufficient under Rule 9(b) if it identifies the circumstances\nconstituting fraud so that the defendant can prepare an\nadequate answer from the allegations.” (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)).11 We have likewise interpreted\nthe phrase “state with particularity all facts,” as contained in\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, to mean\n“that a plaintiff must provide a list of all relevant\ncircumstances in great detail.” In re Silicon Graphics Inc.\nSec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 984 (9th Cir., 1999), abrogated on\nother grounds by South Ferry LP, No. 2 v. Killinger, 542 F.3d\n776, 784 (9th Cir. 2008). Particularity generally necessitates\na great deal of specificity.\n\n    Thus, we agree with the district court that McMaster has\nfailed to plead with particularity when and how he obtained\nownership of the structures located on the former Oro Grande\nmining claim. McMaster’s complaint states:\n\n\n  11\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) states, in relevant part: “In\nalleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the\ncircumstances constituting fraud or mistake.”\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     33\n\n       Incident to, and in furtherance of, the mining\n       operations, three structures have been erected\n       on the Oro Grande mining claim: a cabin, a\n       workshop, and an outhouse. The cabin was\n       built in the early 1890s and is constructed\n       entirely of split logs and shakes. The\n       workshop is used to process samples during\n       mining operations and to store mining\n       equipment during seasons in which mining is\n       not permitted.\n\nMcMaster also states that the Oro Grande claim was\npurchased from Edwin Lynch in 1934 with a Bill of Sale that\nconveyed all improvements, including a cabin and shed.\nMcMaster provided the documents supporting the\nconveyance of the Oro Grande mining claim through time up\nto 1991 when McMaster received a joint tenancy deed for the\nOro Grande mining claim noting improvements, including a\ncabin and a shed.\n\n    With regard to the origins of the title to the\nimprovements, McMaster only generally alleges that the\nstructures were constructed incident to mining operations, and\nspecifically alleges that the cabin was built sometime in the\nearly 1890s. Nowhere does McMaster allege whether or how\nLynch obtained title, or whether he retained title until he sold\nthe Oro Grande mining claim to McMaster. These particular\nfacts are important because title to the structures may have\npassed to the Government at some time. When a claim is\nabandoned or deemed invalid, the title to surface structures\npasses to the United States. See Brothers v. United States,\n594 F.2d 740, 741 (9th Cir. 1979). Thus, McMaster has failed\nto plead with particularly sufficient facts showing all of the\ncircumstances under which his title to the structures was\n\f34             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nacquired, 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(d), and has failed to satisfy his\nburden under the QTA. See 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(d).\n\n    And, in any event, because McMaster no longer holds a\nvalid claim to the Oro Grande lands, by virtue of the fact that\nhe received only a mineral patent, he is required to obtain a\nspecial use permit prior to using the surface of the land. See\n36 C.F.R. § 251.50. Thus, even if McMaster did “own” the\nstructures, he would not have the right to use them, and could\nbe required to remove them.\n\n   We conclude that McMaster’s second QTA claim was\nproperly dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6).\n\nB. APA Claims\n\n    McMaster argues that the district court erred in\ndismissing his APA claims. McMaster’s amended complaint\ncontained three claims seeking relief under the APA.\nMcMaster claimed: (1) that the patent reservations were not\nin accordance with law; (2) that the Solicitor’s Opinion was\nnot in accordance with law; and (3) that the BLM’s patent\nreservations of the surface and remaining mineral estates,\nafter equitable title vested, was arbitrary, capricious, and not\nin accordance with law.\n\n    We agree with the district court that McMaster’s APA\nclaim is essentially a challenge to the United States’ title to\nreal property and, therefore, must be dismissed because the\nQTA is the exclusive means for challenging the United\nStates’ title to real property.\n\n     1. Legal background\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                            35\n\n    The Supreme Court first held in Block v. North Dakota ex\nrel. Bd. of Univ. & Sch. Lands that “Congress intended the\nQTA to provide the exclusive means by which adverse\nclaimants could challenge the United States’ title to real\nproperty,” 461 U.S. 273, 276–77 (1983). In Block, North\nDakota brought suit against the United States to settle a\ndispute over ownership of certain riverbed located in the\nLittle Missouri River. Id. at 277–79. Although North Dakota\nhad asserted a number of jurisdictional bases for its claim that\nit was entitled to injunctive and mandamus relief—including\nthe APA and the DJA,12 id. at 278—the Court held that\n“North Dakota’s action [could] proceed, if at all, only under\nthe QTA.” Id. at 292–93. The Court reasoned that “[t]he\nbalance, completeness, and structural integrity of the [QTA]\nbelied the contention that it was designed merely to\nsupplement other putative judicial relief,” and explained that\nif North Dakota were permitted to seek relief under the other\nstatutes then “all the carefully-crafted provisions of the QTA\ndeemed necessary for the protection of the national public\ninterest could be averted . . . by artful pleading.” Id. at\n284–85 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We\nhave followed the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in Block,\nand have similarly held that “[t]he Quiet Title Act is ‘the\nexclusive means’ by which adverse claimants can challenge\nthe United States’ title to real property,” and that a claimant\n“cannot avoid the limitations of the Quiet Title Act” by\n“seeking review under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\nAlaska v. Babbitt, 182 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n 12\n    North Dakota’s original complaint did not mention the QTA; but the\ndistrict court required it to amend its complaint to bring a QTA claim. Id.\nat 278.\n\f36             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    The rule in Block, however, is not without caveat.\nRecently, in Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of\nPottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, the Supreme Court held that\nthe APA also may apply where the QTA “‘is not addressed to\nthe type of grievance which the plaintiff seeks to assert.’”\n132 S. Ct. 2199, 2205 (2012) (citation omitted). The Court\nexplained that although the QTA “provide[s] the exclusive\nmeans by which adverse claimants [can] challenge the United\nStates’ title to real property,” id. at 2207 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted), where the suit does not involve\nan adverse claim to title, “then the [QTA] cannot prevent an\nAPA suit.” Id. at 2205. Since the plaintiff in Patchak did not\nclaim ownership to the property, but rather, claimed that the\ngovernment’s “decision to take land into trust violates a\nfederal statute—a garden-variety APA claim,” the Court held\nthat the APA, rather than the QTA, applied. Id. at 2208.\n\n   Despite this caveat, it remains clear that under both\nSupreme Court precedent and our precedent that the QTA\nprovides the exclusive remedy for claims involving adverse\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                            37\n\ntitle disputes with the government.13 See Patchak, 132 S. Ct.\nat 2207; Block, 461 U.S. at 286; Alaska, 182 F.3d at 674.\n\n    2. Analysis\n\n    Here, the “essence and bottom line,” Patchak,\n132 S. Ct. at 2207, of McMaster’s APA claims is a dispute\nagainst the government over the title to the reserved surface\nestate of the Oro Grande mining claim.\n\n     This not a case where, for example, the government has\ndisclaimed its title and the claims are founded on\n\n   13\n       McMaster argues that we applied the APA to BLM decisions\nregarding mining claim validity in Hoefler v. Babbitt, 139 F.3d 726,\n728–29 (9th Cir. 1998) and Dredge Corp. v. Conn., 733 F.2d 704, 707\n(9th Cir. 1984). Although it might be argued that the QTA should have\nbeen the exclusive means for relief in these cases because a valid mining\nclaim has been considered an interest in real property, see Humboldt\nPlacer Mining Co. v. Best, 293 F.2d 553, 555 (9th Cir. 1961) (holding that\na valid mining claim is an interest in real property), reversed on other\ngrounds by 371 U.S. 334 (1963); see also United States v. Shumway,\n199 F.3d 1093, 1099–1102, 1105 (9th Cir. 1999); Bradford v. Morrison,\n212 U.S. 389, 394–95 (1909), we need not resolve this question because\nthis case does not involve a declaration that a mining claim was invalid.\n\n      In addition, McMaster cites a series of cases in which we applied the\nAPA to claims to easements on public lands. These cases are inapposite.\nThey involved challenges to the agency’s decision regarding a special use\npermit—i.e., whether the special use permit was wrongfully denied or\nwhether the conditions on the permit were unreasonable. See McFarland\nv. Kempthorne, 545 F.3d 1106, 1110 (9th Cir. 2008); Fitzgerald Living\nTrust v. United States, 460 F.3d 1259, 1263–64 (9th Cir. 2006); Skranak\nv. Castenada, 425 F.3d 1213, 1218 (9th Cir. 2005). We did not determine\ntitle in any of these cases. Cf. Robinson v. United States, 586 F.3d 683,\n688 (9th Cir. 2009) (concluding that “a suit that does not challenge title\nbut instead concerns the use of land as to which title is not disputed can\nsound in tort or contract and not come within the scope of the QTA”).\n\f38             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nadministrative wrongdoing. See Donnelly v. United States,\n850 F.2d 1313, 1317–18 (9th Cir. 1988); Lee v. United States,\n809 F.2d 1406, 1409 n.2 (9th Cir. 1987). As in Block, “the\nonly ‘administrative wrongdoing’ [that McMaster claims is]\nthe government’s alleged wrongful assertion of title itself.”\nDonnelly, 850 F.2d at 1318.\n\n    Since both the Supreme Court’s and our precedents have\nheld that “the QTA provides the exclusive remedy for title\ndisputes against the government,” id. at 1318; see also\nPatchak, 132 S. Ct. at 2207; Block, 461 U.S. at 286; Alaska,\n182 F.3d at 674, McMaster’s APA claims were properly\ndismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\nC. DJA Claims\n\n   McMaster also argues that the district court erred in\ndismissing its three claims seeking relief under the DJA.\n\n     Block’s holding that the QTA is the “exclusive means by\nwhich adverse claimants c[an] challenge the United States’\ntitle to real property,” Block, 461 U.S. at 286, also applies to\nDJA claims. In Block, the plaintiff raised a DJA claim, but the\nCourt determined that only the QTA claims could proceed.\nId. at 278, 292–93.\n\n    Here again, the crux of McMaster’s DJA claims is that\nMcMaster is entitled to fee-simple ownership of his Oro\nGrande mining claim. Thus, McMaster’s DJA claims must\nalso fail. See Patchak, 132 S. Ct. at 2207; Block, 461 U.S. at\n287; Alaska, 182 F.3d at 674; Donnelly, 850 F.2d at 1318.\nMcMaster’s DJA claims were also properly dismissed under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\f              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                    39\n\n                   IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n     We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing\nMcMaster’s claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6). With regard to McMaster’s first QTA\nclaim, we conclude that the Solicitor’s Opinion is entitled to\nat least Skidmore deference, and, thus, McMaster did not have\na “valid existing right” to a fee-simple patent on its Oro\nGrande mining claim. In addition, we conclude that\nMcMaster’s second QTA claim must fail because McMaster\ndid not plead with particularity the circumstances under\nwhich its title to the structures was acquired. Finally, since\nthe QTA is the exclusive means for challenging the United\nStates’ title to real property, we conclude that the district\ncourt also properly dismissed McMaster’s APA and DJA\nclaims.\n\n   AFFIRMED.\n\f",

In addition, the panel held that the claim\nholder’s second Quiet Title Act claim failed because the\nclaim holder failed to plead with particularity the\ncircumstances under which title to the improvements was\nacquired.\n\n\n\n\n  **\n     This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

In 1992, McMaster filed an\napplication for a patent, having satisfied all of the\nrequirements for receiving a patent under the General Mining\nLaw of 1872. However, the Bureau of Land Management\n(“BLM”) granted McMaster a patent to only the mineral\nestate; the surface estate was reserved to the United States.\nMcMaster brought suit under the Quiet Title Act (“QTA”),\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and Declaratory\nJudgment Act (“DJA”), seeking to quiet fee-simple title to the\nOro Grande mining claim and its improvements. The district\ncourt dismissed all of McMaster’s claims under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n  We affirm the district court’s decision. We agree that the\nQTA is the exclusive means for McMaster to bring suit, and\n\f4              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nthus hold that the district court properly dismissed\nMcMaster’s APA and DJA claims. With regard to\nMcMaster’s QTA claims, we hold that McMaster did not\nhave a “valid existing right” to a fee-simple patent when he\nfiled his patent application, and that McMaster failed to plead\nwith particularity the circumstances under which title to the\nimprovements was acquired.\n\n      I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    Ken McMaster, Maureen E. Galitz, and Steven E. Fawl\n(collectively referred to as “McMaster”) own the Oro Grande\nmining claim. The Oro Grande “is an approximate[ly] 20-acre\nplacer mining claim located approximately 45 miles\nnorthwest of Redding, California, along the South Fork\nSalmon River in the Trinity Alps Wilderness.” The claim was\noriginally located in 1934, pursuant to the General Mining\nLaw of 1872.\n\n    In 1934, McMaster’s predecessors-in-interest purchased\nthe Oro Grande—formerly called the Conrad Bar placer\nmine—from the claim’s original locator, Edwin Lynch. The\nBill of Sale conveyed title to the mining claim and all\nimprovements, including a cabin and a shed. The claim was\nsubsequently “relocated” three times between 1934 and 1953.\nThe current configuration of the Oro Grande mining claim\nwas located on June 23, 1953, and the corresponding Notice\nof Location noted improvements made to the claim, including\na cabin and a shed. After a series of intestate successions and\nconveyances, the Oro Grande was conveyed to McMaster on\nApril 5, 1991. The 1991 Joint Tenancy Deed noted the cabin\nand shed as improvements.\n\f              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     5\n\n    McMaster actively mines the Oro Grande mining claim\nwhen conditions permit—“when the South Fork Salmon\nRiver level is low enough . . . and when access to the site is\npossible”—in compliance with state and federal law. There\nare now three structures on the Oro Grande mining claim,\nwhich are used in furtherance of mining operations: a cabin,\na workshop, and an outhouse. The cabin was built in the early\n1890s and is constructed of split logs and shakes. McMaster\nuses the workshop to process samples during the mining\nprocess and to store mining equipment during the seasons in\nwhich he is unable to mine.\n\n    On August 14, 1992, McMaster filed an application to\npatent the Oro Grande mining claim. On August 16, 1993, the\nBLM State Director for California certified that McMaster\nhad fully complied with the requirements of the 1872 Mining\nLaw and was entitled to the First Half Mineral Entry Final\nCertificate (“FHMEFC”), “confirming that mineral entry was\nallowed and occurred upon the date of acceptance of the\npurchase price.” The FHMEFC was issued by the Secretary\nof the Interior on December 1, 1994.\n\n    On August 4, 2000, the BLM issued a mineral report for\nthe Oro Grande mining claim, concluding, inter alia, “[t]hat\na discovery of a valuable mineral deposit of gold was made\non the Oro Grande mining claim at the time it was located in\n1953.” An early draft of the 2000 mineral report\nrecommended that the Oro Grande surface estate be patented\nalong with the mineral estate, but this recommendation was\nultimately revised based on an opinion issued on May 22,\n1998 by the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. See\nSolicitor’s Opinion M-36994, Patenting of Mining Claims\nand Mill Sites in Wilderness Areas (May 22, 1998)\n(“Solicitor’s Opinion”). A second mineral report for the Oro\n\f6              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nGrande mining claim was issued on April 10, 2006, and\nlikewise concluded that there was a discovery of a valuable\nmineral deposit and relied on the Solicitor’s Opinion to\nrecommend that only the mineral estate be patented.\n\n    On October 3, 2008, the BLM issued a patent for the Oro\nGrande mining claim. That patent was later cancelled to\ncorrect an error, and a new patent issued on February 10,\n2009. The patent conveyed only “the mineral deposits within\n[the] association placer mining claim known as the Oro\nGrande Mining Claim,” reserving “[a]ll title in or to the\nsurface estate and products thereof” and “[a] right-of-way\nthereon for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of\nthe United States” to the United States. Since the patent\nissued, the United States Forest Service has asserted that\nMcMaster “do[es] not own the structures located on the Oro\nGrande mining claim.”\n\n    On April 13, 2010, McMaster filed a complaint in federal\ndistrict court under the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2409a, to\nquiet title to fee-simple ownership of the longstanding mining\nstructures and improvements located on the Oro Grande\nmining claim. McMaster also brought a claim under the APA\nfor judicial review of the BLM’s action of issuing a patent\nconveying only the mineral estate. On June 30, 2010, the\nGovernment filed a motion to dismiss McMaster’s complaint\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district\ncourt granted the government’s motion, holding (1) that the\nQTA is the exclusive means for challenging the United\nStates’ title to real property, (2) that under the QTA,\nMcMaster “did not acquire any right to a patent until [he]\nfiled the[] patent application,” at which time McMaster was\nentitled to title to only the mineral estate, and (3) that under\nthe QTA, McMaster failed to “allege[] with particularity\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     7\n\nwhen and how [he] obtained ownership to the structures at\nissue.” McMaster was granted leave to amend his complaint.\n\n    On September 24, 2010, McMaster filed his First\nAmended Complaint, which added new claims under the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. The\ngovernment again filed a motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6), which the district court\ngranted, dismissing McMaster’s complaint with prejudice.\nThe district court concluded that it was barred from\nreconsidering McMaster’s APA claims by the law-of-the-case\ndoctrine. It also dismissed McMaster’s new DJA claims\nbecause it concluded that the QTA is the exclusive means for\nchallenging the United States’ interest in real property.\nRegarding McMaster’s QTA claims, the district court\nconcluded that McMaster had failed to remedy the problems\nthat the court had identified in its prior dismissal order.\nMcMaster timely appealed.\n\n              II.   LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory History\n\n     The General Mining Law of 1872 (“Mining Law”),\n30 U.S.C. § 22 et seq., was enacted to permit citizens to enter\nand explore unappropriated federal lands in search of\n“valuable mineral deposits,” id. § 22. Citizens who\ndiscovered mineral deposits could then secure exclusive\nrights to the land by meeting certain statutory requirements.\nId.; see Independence Min. Co., Inc. v. Babbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733470\"><a href=\"/opinion/733470/97-cal-daily-op-serv-516-97-daily-journal-dar-829-independence/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n506 (9th Cir. 1997). First, a claimant could validate his claim\nby meeting the legal requirements for “locating” and\ndiscovering the claim. See 30 U.S.C. § 28; see also Cole v.\nRalph, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99544\"><a href=\"/opinion/99544/cole-v-ralph/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294–96 (1920). The holder of a valid,\n\f8              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nlocated claim is entitled to the “exclusive right of possession\nand enjoyment of all the surface included within the . . .\nlocation[],” as long as he continues to meet certain\nrequirements. 30 U.S.C. § 26; see id. § 28; see also Best v.\nHumboldt Placer Min. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106511\"><a href=\"/opinion/106511/best-v-humboldt-placer-mining-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335–36 (1963).\nThis possessory interest entitles the claim holder to “the right\nto extract all minerals from the claim without paying royalties\nto the United States,” Independence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at\n506, but the United States retains title to the land, United\nStates v. Locke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111403\"><a href=\"/opinion/111403/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (1985). Second, “an\nindividual who possesses a valid mining claim may go\nthrough an additional process to obtain a patent,” by applying\nto the BLM, in the Department of the Interior, and meeting\nadditional statutory requirements. Swanson v. Babbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629073\"><a href=\"/opinion/629073/elmer-h-swanson-livingston-silver-inc-v-bruce-babbitt-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1350 (9th Cir. 1993); see 30 U.S.C. §§ 29, 35;\nIndependence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at 506. Under the General\nMining Law, a patent generally conveyed fee-simple title to\nboth the surface estate and the mineral deposits. See\nIndependence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at 506; see also Andrus v.\nShell Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110271\"><a href=\"/opinion/110271/andrus-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 & n.1 (1980).\n\n    In 1955, however, Congress enacted the Surface\nResources and Multiple Use Act, 30 U.S.C. § 601–615, which\nestablished that any unpatented claim located after the\neffective date of the Act could not be used “for any purposes\nother than prospecting, mining or processing operations and\nuses reasonable incident thereto,” id. § 612(a); see United\nStates v. Backlund, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (9th Cir. 2012).\nClaimants would no longer receive the exclusive right of\npossession and enjoyment of the surface prior to patenting\ntheir claim; their claims would be subject to “the right of the\nUnited States to manage and dispose” of the surface of any\nsuch mining claim. 30 U.S.C. § 612(b); see Backlund,\n689 F.3d at 991.\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     9\n\n    Then, in 1964, Congress enacted the Wilderness Act,\n16 U.S.C. §§ 1131–36, which “established the National\nWilderness Preservation System [(“NWPS”)] to be composed\nof federally owned areas designated by Congress as\n‘wilderness areas,’” id. § 1131(a). The stated purpose of the\nWilderness Act was to “secure for the American people of\npresent and future generations the benefits of an enduring\nresource of wilderness” by creating and administering\nwilderness areas “for the use and enjoyment of the American\npeople in such manner as will leave them unimpaired for\nfuture use and enjoyment as wilderness, and so as to provide\nfor the protection of these areas, [and] the preservation of\ntheir wilderness character.” Id. The Wilderness Act also\nrepresented a compromise between mining and preservation\ninterests. See Kenneth D. Hubbard et. al., The Wilderness\nAct’s Impact on Mining Activities: Policy Versus\nPractice, 76 Denv. U. L. Rev. 591, 591–92, 597 (1999).\nSection 1133(d)(3), in particular, was a product of this\ncompromise, see id. at 591–92; it limited the creation of\nfuture mining interests, while preserving some pre-existing\nmining interests and providing a grace period for discoveries.\nSee 16 U.S.C. § 1133(d)(3). “[S]ubject to valid existing\nrights,” patents that issued after the effective date of the\nWilderness Act, would convey title only to the mineral\ndeposits, with the surface estate being reserved to the United\nStates. Id. New claims could also be located under the Act,\nbut only until December 31, 1983. Id. After December 31,\n1983, no patent would issue to claims located within a\nwilderness area, “except for valid claims existing on or before\nDecember 31, 1983.” Id. And “[s]ubject to valid rights then\nexisting,” beginning on January 1, 1984, “all forms of\nappropriation under the mining laws” would no longer apply\nto any lands designated as wilderness areas. Id.\n\f10             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    Twenty years later, the California Wilderness Act of 1984\nmade the Wilderness Act applicable to the Oro Grande\nmining claim as of September 28, 1984. Pub. L. No. 98-425,\nTitle I, § 101(a)(34) (1984).\n\nB. Regulatory History\n\n    In 1966, the BLM promulgated a regulation to implement\n§ 1133(d)(3) of the Wilderness Act. See 43 C.F.R. § 3638.5\n(1996) (“the regulation”). The regulation states that any\n“patent issued under the U.S. mining laws for mineral\nlocations established after [the effective date of the\nWilderness Act], or validated by discovery of minerals\noccurring after [the effective date of the Wilderness Act],”\nwould convey title only to the mineral deposits and would\nreserve title to the surface of the land to the United States. Id.\nAlthough § 3638.5 does not directly address whether such a\nreservation of surface rights to the United States applied to\nunpatented claims located prior to the effective date of the\nWilderness Act, in practice, the BLM regularly conveyed fee-\nsimple patents to such claims. See Solicitor’s Opinion at 1,\n19–20. In 1981, the BLM also published a policy stating that\n“[a] patent conveying both surface and mineral rights may be\nissued on a valid claim located prior to the date the area was\nincluded as part of the National Wilderness Preservation\nSystem.” Bureau of Land Management, Wilderness\nManagement Policy, 46 Fed. Reg. 47,180-01 (1981) (“BLM\npolicy”) (emphasis added). And in 1991, the BLM issued a\nmanual stating that “[f]or claims located before enactment of\nthe Wilderness Act . . . the claims must have a discovery as\nof the date of enactment to acquire the surface and mineral\nestates,” BLM Manual H-3860-1, Mineral Patent Application\nProcessing, VIII-7 (1991) (“the Manual”).\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     11\n\n    On May 22, 1998, the Solicitor of the Department of the\nInterior issued Opinion No. M-36994 disagreeing with\nBLM’s practice of conveying fee-simple patents to all valid\nclaims located before the wilderness designation. See\nSolicitor’s Opinion at 20. The Solicitor’s Opinion recognized\nthe BLM’s policies and practices, see id. at 19–20, but\nultimately instructed the BLM to follow a new policy:\n\n       [M]ineral patents issued under the Mining\n       Law for lands within the wilderness areas . . .\n       should convey only the mineral deposits\n       within the claim, unless the mining claim for\n       which the patent is sought was located and\n       validated by a discovery prior to designation\n       of the wilderness area and the claimant\n       complied with all the requirements for\n       obtaining a patent under the Mining Law prior\n       to the wilderness designation, as determined\n       by the Secretary.\n\nId. at 21. This interpretation specified that the new policy\nshould “be applied to . . . currently pending applications.” Id.\n\n                    III.   DISCUSSION\n\n    McMaster appeals the district court’s dismissal of his\nQTA, APA, and DJA claims, arguing that he is entitled to\nfee-simple title to the surface estate of his claim. “We review\nde novo the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).”\nStone v. Travelers Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698434\"><a href=\"/opinion/698434/john-r-stone-v-the-travelers-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436–37 (9th Cir.\n1995). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nA. QTA Claims\n\f12             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    McMaster raised two independent QTA claims: (1) that\nthe QTA required the government to convey fee-simple\nownership of surface and mineral estates of the Oro Grande\nmining claim to McMaster; and (2) that McMaster properly\nholds title to all improvements and structures located on the\nOro Grande mining claim. We consider each in turn.\n\n     1. Fee-simple title to Oro Grande mining claim\n\n    In dismissing McMaster’s first QTA claim, the district\ncourt held pursuant to the Wilderness Act that McMaster did\nnot have a “‘valid existing right’ to a patent conveying fee-\nsimple ownership of the surface estate and structures\nassociated with [its] mining claim.” The relevant portion of\nthe Wilderness Act states:\n\n        [H]ereafter, subject to valid existing rights, all\n        patents issued under the mining laws of the\n        United States affecting national forest lands\n        designated by this chapter as wilderness areas\n        shall convey title to the mineral deposits\n        within the claim . . . , but each such patent\n        shall reserve to the United States all title in or\n        to the surface of the lands and products\n        thereof, and no use of the surface of the claim\n        or the resources therefrom not reasonably\n        required for carrying on mining or prospecting\n        shall be allowed except as otherwise expressly\n        provided in this chapter: Provided, That,\n        unless hereafter specifically authorized, no\n        patent within wilderness areas designated by\n        this chapter shall issue after December 31,\n        1983, except for the valid claims existing on\n        or before December 31, 1983. Mining claims\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                      13\n\n        located after September 3, 1964, within the\n        boundaries of wilderness areas designated by\n        this chapter shall create no rights in excess of\n        those rights which may be patented under the\n        provisions of this subsection.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1133(d)(3) (emphases added).\n\n     McMaster argues that in passing the Wilderness Act,\nCongress intended for claimants to receive fee-simple title to\ntheir pre-existing valid claims. More specifically, McMaster\ncontends that the “valid existing rights” language of the\nWilderness Act protects claimants’ legitimate expectations of\nfee-simple title, preserving the right to the surface estate for\nall those who had properly located a mining claim prior to the\nrelevant wilderness designation.\n\n    McMaster claims that the BLM’s regulation, policy, and\nmanual are consistent with its interpretation and should have\nbeen applied to McMaster’s claim, and that the Solicitor’s\nOpinion, which is contrary to McMaster’s interpretation, is\nnot entitled to any deference.\n\n        a. BLM’s regulation, Manual, and BLM policy\n\n     McMaster argues that the regulation, Manual, and BLM\npolicy are consistent with his interpretation and require that\nMcMaster be issued a fee-simple patent. None of these,\nhowever, clearly requires issuing title to the surface estate for\nall valid claims.\n\n    First, the regulation contained in 43 C.F.R. § 3638.5 states\nthat for “mineral locations established after [the effective date\nof the Wilderness Act], or validated by discovery of minerals\n\f14             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\noccurring after [the effective date of the Wilderness Act],”\ntitle will issue to only the mineral deposits; the United States\nwill retain title to the surface of the land. 43 C.F.R. § 3638.5.\nSection 3638.5 does not even address claims that were\nestablished prior to the effective date of the Wilderness Act.\nAnd stating that claims discovered after the effective date of\nthe Act receive only limited patents does not necessarily\nmean that every valid claim located prior to the time\nannounced in the Regulation is entitled to a fee-simple patent.\n\n    In contrast to the regulation, the Manual addresses claims\nthat were established prior to the wilderness designation. The\nManual states that “[f]or claims located before enactment of\nthe Wilderness Act . . . the claims must have a discovery as\nof the date of enactment to acquire the surface and mineral\nestates,” BLM Manual H-3860-1, Mineral Patent Application\nProcessing, VIII-7 (Apr 17, 1991). Although the Manual\nindicates that a claim must be discovered prior to the\nwilderness designation to receive title to the surface estate,\nnowhere does the manual state that this is all that is required.\nIndeed, discovery is a necessary, but not a sufficient,\ncondition for establishing a valid claim; the claim must also\nbe located “by reference to some natural object or permanent\nmonument as will identify the claim.” 30 U.S.C. § 28; see\nCole, 252 U.S. at 296. Moreover, even if the Manual could be\nread as stating that valid claims established before the\nwilderness designation are entitled to title to the surface state,\nBLM manuals are not legally binding. See Schweiker v.\nHansen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110443\"><a href=\"/opinion/110443/schweiker-v-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789–90 (1981) (holding that a Social\nSecurity manual did not bind the Social Security\nAdministration because it is not a regulation and has “no legal\nforce”); Robert S. Glenn DeLloyd Cazier, 124 IBLA 104, 109\n(IBLA 1992) (“Instruction Memoranda and BLM Manual\nprovisions do not have the force and effect of law and are not\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     15\n\nbinding on either this Board or the public at large.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n    Finally, the BLM policy states that “[a] patent conveying\nboth surface and mineral rights may be issued on a valid\nclaim located prior to the date the area was included as part\nof the National Wilderness Preservation System.” Bureau of\nLand Management, Wilderness Management Policy, 46 Fed.\nReg. 47,180-01 (1981) (emphasis added). Although the BLM\npolicy indicates more clearly that valid claims may receive\nfee-simple title, the language of the policy is discretionary\n(“may be issued”). The policy thus leaves room for BLM to\nimpose additional requirements for receiving fee-simple title.\nAnd, in any event, like the Manual, a BLM management\npolicy is not legally binding.

The Solicitor’s Opinion\n\n     In contrast to McMaster’s interpretation of “valid existing\nrights,” the Solicitor’s Opinion concluded that the term refers\nto a claimant who had actually “filed a patent application, and\nestablished a right to a patent before the land in question was\ndesignated as wilderness” by “complying with all the\nrequirements for obtaining a patent.” Solicitor’s Opinion at 3,\n21. Under this reading, the Wilderness Act does not preserve\na right to a surface estate for those who “located a mining\nclaim and made a discovery of a valuable mineral claim\n\f16             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\ndeposit before the land in question was designated as\nwilderness, but . . . had not established a right to a patent\nbefore the land was designated as wilderness.” Id. at 3–4.\nSince the Solicitor’s Opinion is contrary to McMaster’s\ninterpretation of the statute, we must determine whether it is\nowed deference.\n\n           i.

If we determine that Chevron\ndeference applies, then we move to step two, where we will\ndefer to the agency’s interpretation if it is “based on a\npermissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n843.\n\n   First, we hold that the meaning of “valid existing rights”\nin § 1133(d)(3) is ambiguous under Chevron step one.\nSection 1133(d)(3) clearly excepts “valid existing rights”\nfrom its mandate that patents should be issued to only the\nmineral estate; but what constitutes a “valid existing right[]”\n\f                MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                       17\n\nis not clear from the text; the term is undefined. See Chevron,\n467 U.S. at 842–43. The contrasting interpretations that\nMcMaster and the government offer for “valid existing\nrights” demonstrate the ambiguity inherent in the term. As\nexplained, McMaster argues that “valid existing rights”\npreserves the right to the surface estate for all those who had\nproperly located a mining claim prior to the relevant\nwilderness designation because they had a legitimate\nexpectation that they would receive title. In contrast, the\ngovernment argues that “valid existing rights” are akin to\n“vested rights,” and Congress retains the authority to limit\nand regulate a preexisting mining claimant’s opportunity to\nobtain a patent. Courts that have interpreted the term “valid\nexisting rights” within the context of other statutes have\nsometimes defined the term in accordance with the\ngovernment’s definition, see, e.g., Alaska Miners v. Andrus,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396264\"><a href=\"/opinion/396264/alaska-miners-as-a-class-by-their-representatives-john-stone-ernest-n/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579–80 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding that a plaintiff\nwith valid claim did not have a “valid existing right” to a\npatent “prior to the payment of any money for the granting of\nthe patent for the land”); Freese v.

See\nSolicitor’s Opinion at 19–20.\n\n    Since we conclude that the meaning of “valid existing\nrights” in § 1133(d)(3) is ambiguous under Chevron step one,\nwe must determine how much weight to afford the agency\ninterpretation before moving to step two. See Tualatin Valley\n\n  1\n    The statute at issue in Nat’l Mining Ass’n was the Surface Mining\nControl and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”). The Office of Surface\nMining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”) has stated that “valid\nexisting rights” under SMCRA “is not analogous to [‘valid existing\nrights’] under other Federal statutes,” Valid Existing Rights, 64 Fed. Reg.\n70766-01 (Dec 17, 1999), including our interpretation of “valid existing”\nrights in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. See Aleknagik,\n806 F.2d at 926–27. This further illustrates the ambiguity in the term.\n  2\n   As explained, although the BLM had a practice of issuing fee-simple\npatents to claimants who had located their claims prior to the wilderness\ndesignation, see Solicitor’s Opinion at 19–20, its written policies and\nregulation were arguably not clear as to whether a fee-simple patent must\nalways issue to a claimant in McMaster’s position.\n\f                  MCMASTER V.

Moreover, Solicitor Opinions, generally,\nhave “precedential value”—they “bind future parties.” Marmolejo-\nCampos, 558 F.3d at 909.

It is a well-reasoned, formal, signed,\ntwenty-two page opinion, see Solicitor’s Opinion at 1–22,\nthat is “thorough[] . . . in its consideration,” and ultimately\npersuasive. Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140.\n\n    McMaster argues that the Solicitor’s opinion is\ninconsistent “with earlier . . . pronouncements.” For the\nreasons explained earlier, the Solicitor’s Opinion was not\nclearly contrary to the regulation or, arguably, the Manual,\nalthough it does appear to be in tension with the prior BLM\npolicy (though the policy still left the agency room for\ndiscretion). To the extent there is any inconsistency, however,\nthis is just one factor under Skidmore. The Solicitor’s Opinion\nalso carefully analyzes the text, purpose, and legislative\nhistory of the Wilderness Act, as well as the “modern judicial\ntreatment of valid existing rights with respect to legislation\naffecting mining claims and patents.” Solicitor’s Opinion at\n1–16. In sum, the Solicitor’s Opinion is a “persuasive\ninterpretation of the law,” Tualatin Valley Builders, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\f<span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">                 MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nat 942, despite the fact that it arguably represents a change in\nthe agency’s view.5\n\n    First, the Solicitor’s Opinion’s reading of “valid existing\nrights” is consistent with the text of § 1133(d)(3). Section\n1133(d)(3) states that “hereafter, subject to valid existing\nrights, all patents issued under the mining laws of the United\nStates affecting national forest lands designated by this\nchapter as wilderness areas shall convey title to the mineral\ndeposits within the claim.” Because the phrase “subject to\nvalid existing rights” clearly refers to the issuance of a\nlimited patent to the mineral estate, “valid existing rights”\nmust refer to a claimant’s valid existing right to a patent—not\nmerely a valid claim. See Solicitor’s Opinion at 5 (“[T]he\nphrase ‘valid existing rights’ must refer only to a claimant’s\nvalid existing rights to a patent.”). Moreover, as the\nSolicitor’s Opinion points out, see Solicitor’s Opinion at 6,\n§ 1133(d)(3) references both “valid existing rights” and\n“valid claims.” By virtue of the fact that Congress used both\nof these phrases in the same section of a statute, we infer that\nCongress intended different meanings.

Here, the change in the agency’s practice was not\nunexplained. The Solicitor Opinion clearly, and rather extensively, stated\nthe reasons supporting its interpretation.\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     23\n\ncanon of statutory interpretation that the use of different\nwords or terms within a statute demonstrates that Congress\nintended to convey a different meaning for those words.”).\nThus, the exception of “valid existing rights” from\n§ 1133(d)’s requirement that the surface estate be reserved to\nthe government cannot mean that any “valid claim” is\nexcepted from the requirement that the surface estate be\nreserved. “Valid existing rights” must mean something\ndifferent.\n\n    The Solicitor Opinion’s reading is also consistent with the\npurpose of the Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act was\nenacted to “secure for the American people of present and\nfuture generations the benefits of an enduring resource of\nwilderness” by creating and administering wilderness areas\n“for the use and enjoyment of the American people in such\nmanner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and\nenjoyment as wilderness, and so as to provide for the\nprotection of these areas, [and] the preservation of their\nwilderness character.” 16 U.S.C. § 1131(a). As the Solicitor’s\nOpinion explains, reading “valid existing rights” narrowly, so\nas to require more than a mere “valid claim,” helps to\n“maximize protection of the wilderness” and is consistent\nwith the Act’s “protective thrust.” Solicitor’s Opinion at 7.\nAlthough, to some extent, § 1133(d)(3) also represented a\ncompromise between mining and preservation interests, see\nHubbard, 76 Denv. U. L. Rev. at 597, construing “valid\nexisting rights” in this manner does not interfere with mining\ninterests. A fee-simple patent is not necessary for mining to\ncontinue. See Independence Min. Co, 105 F.3d at 509 (stating\nthat a miner “need not obtain patents to continue its mining\noperation”). The holder of a valid, located claim is entitled to\nthe “exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the\nsurface included within the . . . location[],” 30 U.S.C. § 26;\n\f24             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nsee id. § 28; see also Best, 371 U.S. at 335, and has “the right\nto extract all minerals from the claim without paying royalties\nto the United States,” Independence Min. Co., 105 F.3d at\n506 (internal citation omitted).\n\n    In addition to being consistent with the text and purpose\nof the Wilderness Act, the Solicitor’s Opinion is also in\nharmony with precedent. For example, in Alaska Miners v.\nAndrus, claimants challenged a provision of the Alaska\nNative Claims Settlement Act (“ANCSA”), 43 U.S.C. § 1601\net seq., which limited the issuance of patents to those with\nvalid claims who complied with the mining laws and applied\nfor a patent within a five year period. See Alaska Miners,\n662 F.2d at 579–80; see also 43 U.S.C. § 1621(c). ANCSA\nprovided that “[a]ll conveyances . . . shall be subject to valid\nexisting rights,” 43 U.S.C. § 1613(g) (emphasis added); see\nalso Alaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579–80. The claimants\nargued that miners with valid claims “have a valid existing\nright to require the government to hold open indefinitely the\noption to apply for a patent,” Alaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579,\nessentially the same argument McMaster makes here. We\nheld that:\n\n        Appellants ha[d] no such right to a patent or\n        to the opportunity to apply for a patent outside\n        of the time restriction [mandated by the Act].\n        Appellants may well have an existing right to\n        prevent third parties from interfering with\n        their possessory interest. However, they have\n        no right to prevent the government from\n        conveying the legal title to the native\n        corporations.\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                                25\n\nId. Moreover, we reasoned that “the interest of a claimant in\na mining claim, prior to the payment of any money for the\ngranting of the patent for the land, is nothing more than a\nright to the exclusive possession of the land based upon\nconditions subsequent, a failure to fulfill which forfeits the\nlocator’s interest in the claim.” Id. (emphasis added).6\n\n    The U.S. Court of Claims has similarly held that the\nowner of a valid but unpatented mining claim had no right to\nreceive a patent because he “had not yet taken the first step\ntowards obtaining patents.” Freese, 639 F.2d at 758. In\nresponse to the claimant’s argument that “his right to the\nissuance of a patent upon each of his mining claims vested as\nsoon as he completed the discovery and location of each\nclaim,” the court explained that “[t]he law is well-settled that\n[a] vested right [to a patent] does not arise until there has\nbeen full compliance with the extensive procedures set forth\nin the federal mining laws for the obtaining of a patent.” Id.;\nsee also Cook v.

In contrast, here, “valid existing rights” has been treated\nas a technical, legal term that has been subjected to precise interpretations\nby courts and agencies. See, e.g., Valid Existing Rights, 64 Fed. Reg.\n70766-01 (Dec 17, 1999); Nat’l Mining Ass’n, 512 F.3d at 707–08;\nAleknagik, 806 F.2d at 926–27; Alaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579–80;\nFreese, 639 F.2d at 758.\n\f26                 MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nland, including the filing of all papers and, where applicable,\nthe payment to the United States of the purchase price for a\npatent”). The court also explained that the claimant’s “‘valid\nexisting rights’ in his mining claims [were] . . . preserved,”\ndespite the fact that the claimant was completely denied a\npatent, because the claimant’s “rights of use, enjoyment and\ndisposition in his unpatented mining claims remain[ed]\nundiminished.” Freese, 639 at 758.\n\n    Although we previously held in Aleknagik, with regard to\na different statute, that it was reasonable for an agency to\ninterpret “valid existing rights” “to mean something other\nthan ‘vested’” where plaintiffs had a “legitimate claim” and\nthe government represented that claimants had a right to that\nclaim, 806 F.2d at 926–27,7 no such representation has been\nmade to individuals in McMaster’s situation. We reasoned in\nAleknagik that “legitimate expectations may be recognized as\nvalid existing rights, especially where the expectancy is\ncreated by the government in the first instance.” Id. at 927.\nHere, however, individuals with valid claims who have not\neven filed a patent application do not have a “legitimate\nexpectation” of receiving fee-simple title. They have not yet\ncompleted even the “first step” of the process of applying for\na patent—in contrast to the claimants in Aleknagik. Id. at 926;\nsee 30 U.S.C. § 29. Nor has McMaster claimed that the\ngovernment has somehow represented to individuals with\n\n     7\n     We applied Aleknagik to the ANCSA in Seldovia Native Ass’n,\n904 F.2d at 1343. There we held that conditional purchase options granted\nunder the Alaska Statehood Act “satisfy the requirements of a valid\nexisting right. Because they are granted by the State of Alaska pursuant\nto an Act of Congress, they create legitimate expectations of property\ninterests. In addition, they are rights leading to the acquisition of title.” Id.\nSeldovia is also distinguishable from this case because the claimant had\na legitimate expectation that was clearly created by an Act of Congress.\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                             27\n\nvalid claims that they have a right to fee-simple title.8 Rather,\nthe Mining Act indicates that an individual with a valid claim\nwill have an opportunity to apply for a patent and may\nreceive one if he can meet the statute’s requirements. See\n30 U.S.C. § 29.\n\n    Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that “[a]lthough\nowners of unpatented mining claims hold fully recognized\npossessory interests in their claims, . . . these interests are a\n‘unique form of property.’ The United States, as owner of the\nunderlying fee title to the public domain, maintains broad\npowers over the terms and conditions upon which the public\nlands can be used, leased, and acquired.” Locke, 471 U.S. at\n104 (citations omitted).9 Indeed, we held in Swanson v.\nBabbitt that “[u]ntil a patent is issued, the government has\nbroad authority to manage public lands” and “to remove those\npublic lands from mining claims and patents,” 3 F.3d at 1352.\nThus, individuals such as McMaster, who have only a valid\n\n\n 8\n   By contrast, the government’s conduct in Aleknagik suggested that the\nclaimants—occupants of a townsite—had a right to fee-simple title. At the\nAleknagik claimants’ request, BLM had already completed a preliminary\nprocess for forming a townsite, called “segregation.” 806 F.2d at 925.\nHere, the government has not undertaken any steps to patent the claims\nbecause McMaster has not filed the initial application. Nor has the\ngovernment explicitly represented through its policies that all valid claims\nestablished before the effective date will receive fee-simple title. As\nexplained, neither the regulation, nor the Manual, nor the BLM policy\nclearly require all valid claims to be patented.\n  9\n    Contrary to McMaster’s contentions, the Solicitor’s interpretation is\nalso consistent with Stockley v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100095\"><a href=\"/opinion/100095/stockley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1923). In\nStockley, the Court said that “‘existing valid claims’ [o]bviously means\nsomething less than a vested right.” Id. at 544. Similarly, the Solicitor\ninterpreted “valid existing rights” to mean something more than an\n“existing valid claim.” See Solicitor’s Opinion at 6.\n\f28             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nclaim, do not have a legitimate expectation of receiving a\npatent.\n\n    Finally, the Solicitor’s Opinion also addressed the\nlegislative history to the Wilderness Act. The Opinion\ndiscusses a letter to the House of Representatives from\nAssistant Secretary of the Interior, John A. Carver, Jr.,which\nsuggested adding the language “subject to valid existing\nrights.” H. Rep. No. 88-1538 (1964), reprinted in 1964\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3615. The letter explained:\n\n       The requirement of the bill that all patents\n       issued after the effective date of this act shall\n       convey title to mineral deposits with a\n       reservation to the United States of all title to\n       the surface of the lands must be subject to\n       ‘valid existing rights.” The owner of a valid\n       mining claim perfected under the mining laws\n       prior to the effective date of this act has\n       already acquired a possessory title to the\n       surface of the land and any patent issued on\n       such a claim after the effective date of this act\n       must convey title to both the land and mineral\n       deposits therein, unless provision is made for\n       just compensation.\n\nId. at 3625. Although the letter states that a patent conveying\nfee-simple title “must” issue to the “owner of a valid mining\nclaim perfected under the mining laws prior to the effective\ndate of th[e] act” because the owner has “already acquired a\npossessory title to the surface of the land,” Carver does not\nprovide a legal basis for this assertion. See Solicitor Opinion\nat 9–10. Carver’s reference to “just compensation,” however,\nimplies that his rationale for the amendment is based, at least\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                    29\n\nin part, on avoiding compensable takings. See H. Rep. No.\n88-1538 (1964), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3615, 3625.\nViewed in that context, Carver’s interpretation is an incorrect\nstatement of the law. We have held that just compensation is\nrequired only when the claimant has a vested property right,\nsee Acton v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 899 (9th Cir. 1968),\nwhich requires more than a valid claim and a possessory\ninterest, see Swanson, 3 F.3d at 1348 (holding that a “vested\nright does not arise until there has been full compliance with\nthe extensive procedures set forth in the federal mining laws\nfor the obtaining of a patent” (citation omitted)); see also\nAlaska Miners, 662 F.2d at 579–80.\n\n    In addition to the Carver letter, the Solicitor’s Opinion\nalso discusses the House Committee Report, which was\napparently based on the Carver letter. Solicitor’s Opinion\nat 8. The House Report states that § 1133(d)(3)’s limitation\nof surface rights would apply to “locators of claims staked\nafter the effective date of the act.” H. Rep. No. 88-1538\n(1964), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3615, 3618.\n(emphasis added). As the Solicitor’s Opinion pointed out, this\nstatement is somewhat inconsistent with Carver’s\ninterpretation of the savings clause—those who have merely\nstaked a claim do not yet have a valid claim with a present\npossessory interest. Solicitor’s Opinion at 10.\n\n     We agree with the Solicitor’s Opinion that to the extent\nthat the Carver letter or House Report implied that “owners\nof valid mining claims[, or staked claims,] have, without\nmore, vested rights to a patent including the surface as well\nas the mineral deposits, [that] viewpoint is less persuasive,”\nsee Solicitor’s Opinion at 9, particularly since the Carver\nletter and House Report are somewhat inconsistent in their\ninterpretation of “valid existing rights.” Moreover, the Carver\n\f30                MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nand House Report interpretations are also inconsistent with\nthe text and purpose of the Wilderness Act, as well as\nrelevant case law, as has been explained. We find the\nSolicitor Opinion’s conclusion with regard to the legislative\nhistory convincing: The “valid existing rights” provision is\n“best viewed as responsive to the general constitutional\nconcern the Assistant Secretary raised, rather than as\nlegislating any precise understanding of the scope of those\nrights.” Id. at 10. “[T]he suggestions offered in both the\nCarver letter and the House Committee Report . . . should not\n. . . be regarded as enacting into law a particular view of valid\nexisting rights. Instead, by using such a general, common\nphrase, Congress was leaving it ultimately up to the courts to\ndetermine what ‘valid existing rights’ meant in the patenting\ncontext.” Id.\n\n    In sum, because the Solicitor’s Opinion is consistent with\nthe text of the statute, purpose, and our prior precedent, and\nbecause it adequately discussed and explained legislative\nhistory that could be perceived contrary to its interpretation,\nwe find the Solicitor’s Opinion to be persuasive. We therefore\nconclude that the Solicitor Opinion’s interpretation of “valid\nexisting rights” is entitled to Skidmore deference.\n\n              iii. Application\n\n    Applying the rule set forth in the Solicitor’s Opinion to\nthe facts of this case,10 it is undisputed that as of the effective\n\n\n 10\n    McMaster argues that the rule set forth in the Solicitor’s Opinion has\nan impermissible retroactive effect as applied to its case. See Solicitor’s\nOpinion at 21 (stating that the Opinion should be applied to all “currently\npending patent applications”). Although “retroactivity is not favored in the\nlaw,” and an agency does not have “power to promulgate retroactive rules\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                               31\n\ndate of the California Wilderness Act—September 28,\n1984—McMaster had nothing more than a valid claim in the\nOro Grande. McMaster did not fulfill the requirements for\nprocuring a patent until at least August 14, 1992. Therefore,\nMcMaster did not have a “valid existing right” to a fee-\nsimple patent under the Wilderness Act at the time that he\nsubmitted its patent application, and was properly granted a\npatent with reservation of the surface estates. McMaster’s\nonly “valid existing right” was to a claim, not a patent. The\ndistrict court did not err in dismissing McMaster’s first QTA\nclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\n    2. Fee-simple title to mining structures                             and\n       improvements on Oro Grande mining claim\n\n    McMaster argues that he properly holds title to all\nimprovements and structures located on the Oro Grande\nmining claim because “[i]t is well established that mining\nstructures incident to mining operations may be erected on\nvalid claims,” and “the mining structures [here] were\nconstructed expressly for the benefit of the Oro Grande, and\nbecause they are . . . incident to mining the valuable mineral\ndeposits that were granted in the limited patent, the structures\nare ‘appurtenances’ and were also granted to [McMaster].”\n\n\nunless that power is conveyed by Congress in express terms,” Bowen v.\nGeorgetown Univ. Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112163\"><a href=\"/opinion/112163/bowen-v-georgetown-univ-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (1988), the rule set forth in\nthe Solicitor’s Opinion does not give the statute retroactive effect. The\nSolicitor’s interpretation “does not impact [McMaster’s] current\npossessory interest in the claims, but rather affects only its prospective\ninterest in further property rights in the claims.” R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v.\nBabbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740583\"><a href=\"/opinion/740583/97-cal-daily-op-serv-3617-97-daily-journal-dar-6147-rt-vanderbilt/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1067 (9th Cir. 1997); see Freese, 639 F.2d at 758\n(“At best,” plaintiff, who had a valid claim and was denied an opportunity\nto apply for a patent, “suffered a denial of the opportunity to obtain greater\nproperty than that which he owned . . . .”).\n\f32               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\n    To invoke the QTA, a complaint must “set forth with\nparticularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the\nplaintiff claims in the real property, the circumstances under\nwhich it was acquired, and the right, title, or interest claimed\nby the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(d). We have not\npreviously considered what it means to “set forth with\nparticularity” in the context of § 2409a(d). In another context,\nhowever, this court has interpreted Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 9(b)’s requirement that fraud be pled with\nparticularity to require “[t]he complaint [to] specify such\nfacts as the times, dates, places, benefits received, and other\ndetails of the alleged fraudulent activity.” Neubronner v.\nMilken, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654272\"><a href=\"/opinion/654272/d-neubronner-v-michael-r-milken/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671–72 (9th Cir. 1993) (“A pleading is\nsufficient under Rule 9(b) if it identifies the circumstances\nconstituting fraud so that the defendant can prepare an\nadequate answer from the allegations.” (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)).11 We have likewise interpreted\nthe phrase “state with particularity all facts,” as contained in\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, to mean\n“that a plaintiff must provide a list of all relevant\ncircumstances in great detail.” In re Silicon Graphics Inc.\nSec. Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765192\"><a href=\"/opinion/765192/in-re-silicon-graphics-inc-securities-litigation-edmund-j-janas-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984 (9th Cir., 1999), abrogated on\nother grounds by South Ferry LP, No. 2 v.

Particularity generally necessitates\na great deal of specificity.\n\n    Thus, we agree with the district court that McMaster has\nfailed to plead with particularity when and how he obtained\nownership of the structures located on the former Oro Grande\nmining claim. McMaster’s complaint states:\n\n\n  11\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) states, in relevant part: “In\nalleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the\ncircumstances constituting fraud or mistake.”\n\f               MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                     33\n\n       Incident to, and in furtherance of, the mining\n       operations, three structures have been erected\n       on the Oro Grande mining claim: a cabin, a\n       workshop, and an outhouse. The cabin was\n       built in the early 1890s and is constructed\n       entirely of split logs and shakes. The\n       workshop is used to process samples during\n       mining operations and to store mining\n       equipment during seasons in which mining is\n       not permitted.\n\nMcMaster also states that the Oro Grande claim was\npurchased from Edwin Lynch in 1934 with a Bill of Sale that\nconveyed all improvements, including a cabin and shed.\nMcMaster provided the documents supporting the\nconveyance of the Oro Grande mining claim through time up\nto 1991 when McMaster received a joint tenancy deed for the\nOro Grande mining claim noting improvements, including a\ncabin and a shed.\n\n    With regard to the origins of the title to the\nimprovements, McMaster only generally alleges that the\nstructures were constructed incident to mining operations, and\nspecifically alleges that the cabin was built sometime in the\nearly 1890s. Nowhere does McMaster allege whether or how\nLynch obtained title, or whether he retained title until he sold\nthe Oro Grande mining claim to McMaster. These particular\nfacts are important because title to the structures may have\npassed to the Government at some time. When a claim is\nabandoned or deemed invalid, the title to surface structures\npasses to the United States. See Brothers v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364237\"><a href=\"/opinion/364237/gloria-a-brothers-and-edgar-c-newall-v-the-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (9th Cir. 1979). Thus, McMaster has failed\nto plead with particularly sufficient facts showing all of the\ncircumstances under which his title to the structures was\n\f34             MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES\n\nacquired, 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(d), and has failed to satisfy his\nburden under the QTA. See 28 U.S.C. § 2409a(d).\n\n    And, in any event, because McMaster no longer holds a\nvalid claim to the Oro Grande lands, by virtue of the fact that\nhe received only a mineral patent, he is required to obtain a\nspecial use permit prior to using the surface of the land. See\n36 C.F.R. § 251.50. Thus, even if McMaster did “own” the\nstructures, he would not have the right to use them, and could\nbe required to remove them.\n\n   We conclude that McMaster’s second QTA claim was\nproperly dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6).\n\nB. APA Claims\n\n    McMaster argues that the district court erred in\ndismissing his APA claims. McMaster’s amended complaint\ncontained three claims seeking relief under the APA.\nMcMaster claimed: (1) that the patent reservations were not\nin accordance with law; (2) that the Solicitor’s Opinion was\nnot in accordance with law; and (3) that the BLM’s patent\nreservations of the surface and remaining mineral estates,\nafter equitable title vested, was arbitrary, capricious, and not\nin accordance with law.\n\n    We agree with the district court that McMaster’s APA\nclaim is essentially a challenge to the United States’ title to\nreal property and, therefore, must be dismissed because the\nQTA is the exclusive means for challenging the United\nStates’ title to real property.\n\n     1. Legal background\n\f                  MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                            35\n\n    The Supreme Court first held in Block v. North Dakota ex\nrel. Bd. of Univ. & Sch. Lands that “Congress intended the\nQTA to provide the exclusive means by which adverse\nclaimants could challenge the United States’ title to real\nproperty,” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110923\"><a href=\"/opinion/110923/block-v-north-dakota-ex-rel-board-of-univ-and-school-lands/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276–77 (1983). In Block, North\nDakota brought suit against the United States to settle a\ndispute over ownership of certain riverbed located in the\nLittle Missouri River. Id. at 277–79. Although North Dakota\nhad asserted a number of jurisdictional bases for its claim that\nit was entitled to injunctive and mandamus relief—including\nthe APA and the DJA,12 id. at 278—the Court held that\n“North Dakota’s action [could] proceed, if at all, only under\nthe QTA.” Id. at 292–93. The Court reasoned that “[t]he\nbalance, completeness, and structural integrity of the [QTA]\nbelied the contention that it was designed merely to\nsupplement other putative judicial relief,” and explained that\nif North Dakota were permitted to seek relief under the other\nstatutes then “all the carefully-crafted provisions of the QTA\ndeemed necessary for the protection of the national public\ninterest could be averted . . . by artful pleading.” Id. at\n284–85 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We\nhave followed the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in Block,\nand have similarly held that “[t]he Quiet Title Act is ‘the\nexclusive means’ by which adverse claimants can challenge\nthe United States’ title to real property,” and that a claimant\n“cannot avoid the limitations of the Quiet Title Act” by\n“seeking review under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\nAlaska v.

As in Block, “the\nonly ‘administrative wrongdoing’ [that McMaster claims is]\nthe government’s alleged wrongful assertion of title itself.”\nDonnelly, 850 F.2d at 1318.\n\n    Since both the Supreme Court’s and our precedents have\nheld that “the QTA provides the exclusive remedy for title\ndisputes against the government,” id. at 1318; see also\nPatchak, 132 S. Ct. at 2207; Block, 461 U.S. at 286; Alaska,\n182 F.3d at 674, McMaster’s APA claims were properly\ndismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\nC. DJA Claims\n\n   McMaster also argues that the district court erred in\ndismissing its three claims seeking relief under the DJA.\n\n     Block’s holding that the QTA is the “exclusive means by\nwhich adverse claimants c[an] challenge the United States’\ntitle to real property,” Block, 461 U.S. at 286, also applies to\nDJA claims. In Block, the plaintiff raised a DJA claim, but the\nCourt determined that only the QTA claims could proceed.\nId. at 278, 292–93.\n\n    Here again, the crux of McMaster’s DJA claims is that\nMcMaster is entitled to fee-simple ownership of his Oro\nGrande mining claim. Thus, McMaster’s DJA claims must\nalso fail. See Patchak, 132 S. Ct. at 2207; Block, 461 U.S. at\n287; Alaska, 182 F.3d at 674; Donnelly, 850 F.2d at 1318.\nMcMaster’s DJA claims were also properly dismissed under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n\f              MCMASTER V. UNITED STATES                    39\n\n                   IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n     We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing\nMcMaster’s claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6). With regard to McMaster’s first QTA\nclaim, we conclude that the Solicitor’s Opinion is entitled to\nat least Skidmore deference, and, thus, McMaster did not have\na “valid existing right” to a fee-simple patent on its Oro\nGrande mining claim. In addition, we conclude that\nMcMaster’s second QTA claim must fail because McMaster\ndid not plead with particularity the circumstances under\nwhich its title to the structures was acquired. Finally, since\nthe QTA is the exclusive means for challenging the United\nStates’ title to real property, we conclude that the district\ncourt also properly dismissed McMaster’s APA and DJA\nclaims.\n\n   AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
