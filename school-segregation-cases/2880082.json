For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.\n\n              Brown filed a civil rights complaint claiming, among other things, that the\n\nconditions of his confinement in the Long Term Segregation Unit at the State\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\fCorrectional Institution in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania constituted cruel and unusual\n\npunishment, and that correctional officers retaliated against him for his legal actions. In\n\nMarch 2005, we vacated a District Court order dismissing Brown’s third amended\n\ncomplaint for a failure to satisfy the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 8, finding his pro se complaint intelligible and organized by claim.\n\n              In his mandamus petition, Brown complains that, on remand, the District\n\nCourt improperly denied his motion for appointment of counsel and motion to strike the\n\ndefendants’ answer to his complaint, refused to make explicit discovery rulings, and\n\nimproperly granted summary judgment for some of the defendants.\n\n              Although Brown contends that he is seeking an order requiring the District\n\nCourt to comply with our remand order, he is actually seeking review of the District\n\nCourt’s rulings. We will not issue a writ of mandamus if relief may be granted by way of\n\nan ordinary appeal. In re Ford Motor Co., 110 F.3d 954, 957 (3d Cir. 1997). Brown may\n\nseek relief by way of an ordinary appeal after the District Court enters a final order.\n\n              Accordingly, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus. Brown’s\n\nmotion to stay the District Court proceedings is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f",
