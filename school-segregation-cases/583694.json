In his complaint, McKoy alleged that the defendants denied him access to the courts by denying him state law materials that he needed to file an amended complaint in a pending state action.   McKoy attached an exhibit to his complaint.   The exhibit was a request to Brennan for access to the state law materials in which McKoy explained that he was proceeding pro se in a pending state court action and that he had been denied access to the materials three times by Barrow, the prison policy being not to bring such materials to the segregation area.   McKnelly responded to the request on the same form by explaining that the materials in question were occasionally at the prison on loan from the University of Wisconsin where they are returned when not needed for classes at the prison.   McKnelly advised McKoy to seek assistance from the Legal Assistance to Institutionalized Persons Program at the University of Wisconsin Law School (\"LAIPP\").   McKoy's complaint alleged that the LAIPP does not file damages claims for prisoners.   He also described his need for the materials, indicating that his case had languished because of the dilatory representation by his lawyer, on account of which he had taken over pro se.   He wished to proceed promptly before the state court wearied of the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for dismissal based on a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).   They argued that the facility at Oxford did not contain any state law materials and that a federal facility has no duty to provide such materials if an inmate chooses not to accept adequate alternative services.   They further argued that McKoy had failed to allege a lack of outside legal assistance, access to jailhouse lawyers, or access to other alternative legal services.   They also noted that McKoy had voluntarily dismissed his counsel in the state proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKoy filed a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, alleging that the materials in question were available on the shelves at Oxford at the time of his request for use by the general population, but not to those in segregation.   He stated that he dismissed his retained counsel in his state action because his counsel was ineffective and negligent in pursuing his case.   He further alleged that he had no other adequate alternative because:  1) the LAIPP had a waiting list over a year long, which was of no avail to McKoy's pending state litigation, and, in any event, the LAIPP does not handle damages suits against prison officials;  and 2) jailhouse lawyers are not available to inmates in segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint without prejudice.   In finding that McKoy's allegations did not support a claim that he was denied reasonable access to the courts, the district court was apparently under the impression that McKoy had access to the LAIPP and had overlooked McKoy's allegation to the contrary.   The district court also found that McKoy had not alleged prejudice by the defendants' actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKoy filed a motion to alter and amend the judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), alleging as prejudice that his state court case was dismissed.   The district court found that McKoy's new allegations did not support a claim that he was denied reasonable access to the courts and denied McKoy's motion to alter and amend the judgment.   McKoy, pro se, appeals the district court's dismissal of his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the grant of a motion to dismiss is  de novo.

Mosley v. Klincar, 947 F.2d 1338, 1339 (7th Cir.1991).  \"A complaint should not be dismissed 'unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.' \"   Johnson, 943 F.2d at 16 (quoting  Conley v.

In Hossman, we held that even a pro se plaintiff alleging denial of access to the courts must articulate some \"quantum of detriment\" to survive a summary judgment motion.   Id. at 1022 n. 2.

McKoy's complaint indicates that the denial of the state law materials thwarted his ability to pursue his state claim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which is a sufficient allegation of prejudice.
