Cummings filed suit\nchallenging the sexual orientation provisions of the New Jersey\nLaw Against Discrimination. The district court dismissed their\nfacial First Amendment challenge and abstained from deciding\ntheir \"as applied\" challenge. For reasons somewhat different\nfrom those given by the district court, we will affirm.\n\n                               I.\n\f         In 1992, the New Jersey Legislature added \"affectional\nand sexual orientation\" to the list of protected classes in its\nLaw Against Discrimination. The amendments made it illegal to\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in the employment\nrelationship, in public accommodations, and in business dealings.\n         To appellants, the Law Against Discrimination\namendments represented New Jersey's repudiation of 5,000 years of\nJudeo-Christian morality. They believed that the Law Against\nDiscrimination's provisions forbidding aiding and abetting\ndiscrimination trammeled their rights to follow the tenets of\ntheir religion in their business dealings and to preach against\nimmorality in general and homosexuality in particular.\nAccordingly, they filed this ยง 1983 action alleging that the 1992\namendments violated the First Amendment right of free speech,\nalleging that the amended Law Against Discrimination is both\nunconstitutionally overbroad and a content-based restriction on\nspeech.\n         The facts underlying this dispute have been set forth\nseveral times by now. See Presbytery v. Florio, 60 F.E.P. Cases\n(BNA) 805, 1992 WL 414680 (D.N.J.), aff'd mem., 983 F.2d 1052 (3d\nCir. 1992) (Presbytery I); Presbytery v. Florio, 830 F. Supp. 241\n(D.N.J. 1993), rev'd in part, 40 F.3d 1454 (3d Cir. 1994)\n(Presbytery II); Presbytery v. Florio, 902 F. Supp. 492 (D.N.J.\n1995) (Presbytery III). Appellants assert that the theological\ndoctrine of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and its members is\nbased strictly upon Biblical teachings. As such, appellants\nassert that this doctrine requires them to condemn homosexuality,\nboth publicly and in their private lives and business dealings by\nspeaking out against it and by avoiding those who engage in it.\nThe sincerity with which these beliefs are held is not disputed.\n         The Law Against Discrimination amendments generally\nexempt religious organizations from their provisions regarding\nhiring. See N.J.S.A. ยง 10:5-12(a). Moreover, the director of the\nNew Jersey Division on Civil Rights has stipulated that places of\nworship are not public accommodations within the meaning of the\nLaw Against Discrimination and that Reverend Cummings would\ntherefore not be subject to liability for discriminatory acts he\nmight commit in his capacity as a pastor. Nevertheless, Cummings\npoints to several provisions of the Law Against Discrimination\nwhich he believes could subject him and other religionists to\nsuit in their capacities as private citizens: (1) N.J.S.A. ยง\n10:5-12(e), which bans aiding and abetting, inciting, compelling\nor coercing another to perform a discriminatory act; (2) N.J.S.A.\nยง 10:5-12(n), which generally forbids aiding and abetting a\nboycott; (3) N.J.S.A. ยง 10:5-12(j), which requires the posting of\nnotices of nondiscrimination; and, (4) to the extent incorporated\nby the two aiding and abetting provisions, ยง 10:5-12(c)\n(proscribing employer from printing or circulating discriminatory\nstatements), ยง 10:5-12(f) (in public accommodations), ยง 10:5-\n12(l) (prohibiting refusal to do business); ยง 10:5-12(h)\n(prohibiting requirement of boycott as condition of doing\nbusiness). For example, appellants assert that if a person,\nfollowing the tenets of his or her religion, circulated tracts\ncondemning homosexuality and exhorting employers to discharge\n\fsuch persons, and if an employer read one of those tracts and\nacted upon it, the person who caused the tract to be printed\ncould be held liable as an aider and abettor.\n         The district court first held that, while the\nchallenges to the aiding and abetting prohibitions were ripe for\nreview, the notice posting challenge was not. 902 F. Supp. at\n503-09. Then, after determining that Reverend Cummings had both\nindividual and third party standing, it proceeded to consider\nwhether it should abstain from reaching the merits under the\nPullman abstention doctrine. The court held that, to the extent\nappellants were asserting a valid facial challenge to the Law\nAgainst Discrimination, abstention would be improper, but it\nconcluded ultimately that the Law Against Discrimination was not\nfacially unconstitutional. Id. at 516-23. It then abstained as\nto the \"as applied\" challenge, but retained jurisdiction. Id. at\n523.\n                               II.\n         The district court first considered whether appellants'\nfacial challenge to the amended Law Against Discrimination was\nmeritorious. It viewed this challenge as having two principal\narguments: first, that the statute is unconstitutionally\noverbroad; and second, that it is an unconstitutional content-\nbased, viewpoint-discriminatory restriction on speech. 902 F.\nSupp. at 516. It rejected the facial challenge because it\nbelieved that the Law Against Discrimination provisions at issue\nwere capable of some constitutional application and because\nappellants had not demonstrated that the challenged provisions\nare overbroad. Id. at 516-17. The district court rejected the\nviewpoint discrimination challenge under the \"secondary effects\"\ndoctrine set forth in Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.\n41, 106 S. Ct. 925 (1986), opining that, because the Law Against\nDiscrimination provisions were not targeted at speech condemning\nhomosexuality but rather the effects of discriminatory conduct,\nthey passed constitutional muster because they were rational and\nserved the substantial government interest of ending\ndiscrimination. Id. at 517-22.\n\n                                A.\n     For the most part, we agree with the district court's\nanalysis of appellants' facial challenge. In City Council of the\nCity of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 104\nS.Ct. 2118 (1984), the Supreme Court discussed facial invalidity\nunder the First Amendment. First, it noted that a statute may be\ndeclared facially invalid if it is \"apparent that any attempt to\nenforce such legislation would create an unacceptable risk of the\nsuppression of ideas.\" Id. at 797, 104 S. Ct. at 2124 (emphasis\nadded). That is plainly not the case here. As the district\ncourt aptly noted under the aid and abet provision,\n     the State could permissibly prohibit, for example, an\n     individual from offering a $500 reward to employers for\n     each time that they refuse to hire a gay or lesbian job\n     applicant because of the applicant's sexual\n     orientation. Such a reward scheme would have little to\n     do with the expression of ideas and could legitimately\n\f     be regulated by the state[.]\n\n902 F. Supp. at 517. Likewise, a person who threatened a\nbusiness if it refused to fire its gay employees could certainly\nbe held liable as a \"coercer\" under the Law Against\nDiscrimination without offending the Speech Clause.\n     Appellants argue that this statute is indeed incapable of\nany constitutional application, relying on Dambrot v. Central\nMich. Univ., 55 F.3d 1177 (6th Cir. 1995), and Doe v. University\nof Mich., 721 F. Supp. 852 (E.D. Mich. 1989). Those cases,\nhowever, are inapposite. Both involved university \"hate speech\ncodes\" that explicitly purported to regulate speech and other\nprotected First Amendment activity. Because protected activity\nwas the target of these regulations, they had no constitutional\napplication and were thus facially invalid.\n     Nor are we persuaded that City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S.\n451, 107 S. Ct. 2502 (1987), militates towards finding the Law\nAgainst Discrimination facially unconstitutional. In that case,\na municipal ordinance made it \"unlawful for any person to\nassault, strike, or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or\ninterrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty,\" and the\nSupreme Court declared the statute unconstitutional on its face.\nId. at 467, 107 S. Ct. at 2512. Appellants point to the\nunprotected conduct proscribed in that statute and argue that the\nfact that unprotected conduct is likewise regulated by the Law\nAgainst Discrimination cannot therefore foreclose a facial\nchallenge to that statute. A careful reading of Hill, however,\ndiscloses that all of the prohibited conduct in that ordinance\nwas preempted by the state criminal code, leaving only the speech\nrestrictions intact as a matter of state law. That being the\ncase, there were no constitutional applications of the ordinance\nand the Supreme Court invalidated it on facial grounds. Here,\nthe \"conduct\" restrictions are an integral part of New Jersey law\nand have been enforced for most of the last half-century.\nAccordingly, Hill is not dispositive.\n     Second, the Vincent court discussed overbreadth, the other\nway in which a statute might be found facially invalid:\n     [T]he very existence of some broadly written statutes\n     may have such a deterrent effect on free expression\n     that they should be subject to challenge even by a\n     party whose own conduct may be unprotected. The Court\n     has repeatedly held that such a statute may be\n     challenged on its face even though a more narrowly\n     drawn statute would be valid as applied to the party in\n     the case before it. This exception from the general\n     rule is predicated on a judicial prediction or\n     assumption that the statute's very existence may cause\n     others not before the court to refrain from\n     constitutionally protected speech or expression.\n\nId. at 798-99, 104 S. Ct. at 2125 (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, the overbreadth doctrine permits\na litigant whose own activities are unprotected to challenge the\nstatute by claiming that is infringes the rights of others not\n\fbefore the court. In this case, however, appellants make no\nargument that, while their own activities may be unprotected, the\nprotected activities of third parties not before the court might\nbe drawn within the ambit of the Law Against Discrimination.\nRather, it appears that appellants' activities are no different\nfrom those of any other person who might assert a First Amendment\nchallenge to the statute. That is fatal to appellants' claim\nthat the Law Against Discrimination is unconstitutionally\noverbroad. Id. at 801-02, 104 S. Ct. at 2127 (overbreadth\nchallenge inappropriate where it appeared that, if ordinance\ncould be validly applied to plaintiffs, it could be validly\napplied to anybody). Accordingly, we agree with the district\ncourt that appellants have not presented a valid facial challenge\nto the Law Against Discrimination.\n                                B.\n     That leaves appellants with an \"as applied\" challenge to the\nLaw Against Discrimination, specifically appellants' argument\nthat the Law Against Discrimination is an impermissible content-\nbased restriction on speech. The district court apparently\nbelieved that this argument was part of appellants' facial\nchallenge to the statute, since it engaged in a detailed legal\nanalysis of the issue in that section of its opinion. See 902 F.\nSupp. at 517-22.\n     That analysis, however, was unnecessary, and consequently we\nexpress no view as to its correctness. Once the district court\ndetermined that the challenged Law Against Discrimination\nprovisions were capable of some constitutional application and\nthat they are not properly the subject of an overbreadth\nchallenge, there was no remaining issue of facial invalidity to\nbe decided. Rather, whether the Law Against Discrimination was\nan unconstitutional content-based restraint on speech could only\nbe determined within the context of its application to\nappellants. Thus, if the district court correctly abstained from\ndeciding appellants' as applied challenge, its discussion of\nviewpoint discrimination and the secondary effects doctrine was\nunnecessary.\n                                C.\n     We believe that the district court correctly applied\nPullmanabstention. Pullman abstention may be employed \"when a federal\ncourt is presented with both a federal constitutional issue and\nan unsettled issue of state law whose resolution might narrow or\neliminate the federal constitutional question, . . . [thus]\navoid[ing] 'needless friction with state policies.'\" Chez Sez\nIII Corp. v. Township of Union, 945 F.2d 628, 631 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(quoting Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496, 500, 61 S. Ct.\n643, 645 (1941)). As a matter of law, Pullman abstention\nrequires the following special circumstances: (1) uncertain\nissues of state law underlying the federal constitutional claim;\n(2) state law issues subject to state court interpretation that\ncould obviate the need to adjudicate or substantially narrow the\nscope of the federal constitutional claim; and (3) an erroneous\nconstruction of state law by the federal court would disrupt\nimportant state policies. Chez Sez, 945 F.2d at 631; accordHughes v.\nLipscher, 906 F.2d 961, 964 (3d Cir. 1990). If these\n\fspecial circumstances are all present, the court should make a\n\"discretionary determination\" as to whether abstention is\nappropriate under the circumstances, based on certain \"equitable\nconsiderations.\" Chez Sez, 945 F.2d at 631. We find, as did the\ndistrict court, that all three requirements are met here and that\nabstention is appropriate under these circumstances.\n     First, it is clear that the state law issues are uncertain.\nAlthough there is some evidence that New Jersey would interpret\nthis language in the Law Against Discrimination in the same\nmanner as it does in the criminal law context, see Baliko v.\nStecker, 645 A.2d 1218, 1223 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1994), the New\nJersey Supreme Court has interpreted the language \"aid, abet,\nincite, compel or coerce\" only once in the context of a First\nAmendment challenge, and that case involved commercial speech.\nSee Passaic Daily News v. Blair, 308 A.2d 649 (N.J. 1973), in\nwhich the supreme court held that providing sex-segregated\nclassified advertising columns aided employers' acts of sex\ndiscrimination. In sum, we simply do not know how the courts of\nNew Jersey would interpret the \"aid and abet\" language.\n     Second, it is quite possible that the New Jersey courts\nwould construe the challenged language so as to avoid reaching\nthe type of conduct in which Reverend Cummings and others\nsimilarly situated engage. Indeed, the state agency responsible\nfor the statute's enforcement has stipulated that the Law Against\nDiscrimination should not be construed to reach speech protected\nunder the First Amendment. Should the New Jersey courts agree\n(and it indeed appears that the agency's views would be entitled\nto considerable weight, see Blair, 308 A.2d at 654), it is likely\nthat appellants' First Amendment claim would be substantially\nnarrowed, if not eliminated entirely.\n     Third, the potential for disruption of important state\npolicies is manifest. For many decades, the Law Against\nDiscrimination has been a powerful tool in New Jersey's war\nagainst discrimination. Were we to erroneously construe it to\nreach appellants' conduct and then find it violative of the First\nAmendment, we could eviscerate the entire aiding and abetting\nprohibitions, not only for sexual orientation, but for race,\ngender and creed as well. See N.J.S.A. ยง 10:5-12(a).\n     Thus, we conclude that the district court had the power to\nabstain under the Pullman doctrine. Turning to the equitable\nfactors, we also conclude that its application of Pullmanabstention was a\nproper exercise of its discretion. Although\nabstention should generally not be applied to facial challenges,\nthere is no such restriction with respect to an \"as applied\"\nchallenge because there is less of a concern that protected\nactivity will be inhibited if the court abstains from deciding\nthe First Amendment issues. Chez Sez, 945 F.2d at 633-34.\n     Appellants point to the additional delay which they will\nsuffer if they are forced to adjudicate their state law issues in\nthe New Jersey courts, relying on Stretton v. Disciplinary Bd.,\n944 F.2d 137, 140 (3d Cir. 1991), and Biegenwald v. Fauver, 882\nF.2d 748, 750-51 (3rd Cir. 1989). Stretton, however, involved an\nimminent judicial election and the plaintiff in Biegenwald was\nunder sentence of death. In both cases, abstention threatened\n\fany possibility of relief. The situation here is simply not that\nextreme.\n     Moreover, New Jersey law provides for declaratory relief\nwhen a person is unsure of the application of a statute. SeeN.J.S.A. ยง\n2A:15-53. Thus, appellants had and continue to have\nthe statutory opportunity to obtain a definitive construction of\nthe Law Against Discrimination provisions at issue from the New\nJersey courts. Thus, any delay is at least partly of appellants'\nown making, as they plainly possessed the right to seek a\ndeclaratory judgment in state court from the outset of this\nlitigation and should have realized that federal court abstention\nwas at least a possibility.\n                               III.\n     Because appellants have not presented a valid facial\nchallenge to the Law Against Discrimination and because the\ndistrict court abstained properly from their \"as applied\"\nchallenge, we will affirm.\n\f",

Cummings filed suit\nchallenging the sexual orientation provisions of the New Jersey\nLaw Against Discrimination. The district court dismissed their\nfacial First Amendment challenge and abstained from deciding\ntheir \"as applied\" challenge. For reasons somewhat different\nfrom those given by the district court, we will affirm.\n\n                               I.\n\f         In 1992, the New Jersey Legislature added \"affectional\nand sexual orientation\" to the list of protected classes in its\nLaw Against Discrimination. The amendments made it illegal to\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in the employment\nrelationship, in public accommodations, and in business dealings.\n         To appellants, the Law Against Discrimination\namendments represented New Jersey's repudiation of 5,000 years of\nJudeo-Christian morality. They believed that the Law Against\nDiscrimination's provisions forbidding aiding and abetting\ndiscrimination trammeled their rights to follow the tenets of\ntheir religion in their business dealings and to preach against\nimmorality in general and homosexuality in particular.\nAccordingly, they filed this ยง 1983 action alleging that the 1992\namendments violated the First Amendment right of free speech,\nalleging that the amended Law Against Discrimination is both\nunconstitutionally overbroad and a content-based restriction on\nspeech.\n         The facts underlying this dispute have been set forth\nseveral times by now.

Appellants assert that the theological\ndoctrine of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and its members is\nbased strictly upon Biblical teachings. As such, appellants\nassert that this doctrine requires them to condemn homosexuality,\nboth publicly and in their private lives and business dealings by\nspeaking out against it and by avoiding those who engage in it.\nThe sincerity with which these beliefs are held is not disputed.\n         The Law Against Discrimination amendments generally\nexempt religious organizations from their provisions regarding\nhiring. See N.J.S.A. ยง 10:5-12(a). Moreover, the director of the\nNew Jersey Division on Civil Rights has stipulated that places of\nworship are not public accommodations within the meaning of the\nLaw Against Discrimination and that Reverend Cummings would\ntherefore not be subject to liability for discriminatory acts he\nmight commit in his capacity as a pastor. Nevertheless, Cummings\npoints to several provisions of the Law Against Discrimination\nwhich he believes could subject him and other religionists to\nsuit in their capacities as private citizens: (1) N.J.S.A. ยง\n10:5-12(e), which bans aiding and abetting, inciting, compelling\nor coercing another to perform a discriminatory act; (2) N.J.S.A.\nยง 10:5-12(n), which generally forbids aiding and abetting a\nboycott; (3) N.J.S.A. ยง 10:5-12(j), which requires the posting of\nnotices of nondiscrimination; and, (4) to the extent incorporated\nby the two aiding and abetting provisions, ยง 10:5-12(c)\n(proscribing employer from printing or circulating discriminatory\nstatements), ยง 10:5-12(f) (in public accommodations), ยง 10:5-\n12(l) (prohibiting refusal to do business); ยง 10:5-12(h)\n(prohibiting requirement of boycott as condition of doing\nbusiness). For example, appellants assert that if a person,\nfollowing the tenets of his or her religion, circulated tracts\ncondemning homosexuality and exhorting employers to discharge\n\fsuch persons, and if an employer read one of those tracts and\nacted upon it, the person who caused the tract to be printed\ncould be held liable as an aider and abettor.\n         The district court first held that, while the\nchallenges to the aiding and abetting prohibitions were ripe for\nreview, the notice posting challenge was not. 902 F. Supp. at\n503-09. Then, after determining that Reverend Cummings had both\nindividual and third party standing, it proceeded to consider\nwhether it should abstain from reaching the merits under the\nPullman abstention doctrine. The court held that, to the extent\nappellants were asserting a valid facial challenge to the Law\nAgainst Discrimination, abstention would be improper, but it\nconcluded ultimately that the Law Against Discrimination was not\nfacially unconstitutional. Id. at 516-23. It then abstained as\nto the \"as applied\" challenge, but retained jurisdiction. Id. at\n523.\n                               II.\n         The district court first considered whether appellants'\nfacial challenge to the amended Law Against Discrimination was\nmeritorious. It viewed this challenge as having two principal\narguments: first, that the statute is unconstitutionally\noverbroad; and second, that it is an unconstitutional content-\nbased, viewpoint-discriminatory restriction on speech. 902 F.\nSupp. at 516. It rejected the facial challenge because it\nbelieved that the Law Against Discrimination provisions at issue\nwere capable of some constitutional application and because\nappellants had not demonstrated that the challenged provisions\nare overbroad. Id. at 516-17. The district court rejected the\nviewpoint discrimination challenge under the \"secondary effects\"\ndoctrine set forth in Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111597\"><a href=\"/opinion/111597/renton-v-playtime-theatres-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111597\"><a href=\"/opinion/111597/renton-v-playtime-theatres-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id. at 517-22.\n\n                                A.\n     For the most part, we agree with the district court's\nanalysis of appellants' facial challenge. In City Council of the\nCity of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111175\"><a href=\"/opinion/111175/members-of-city-council-of-los-angeles-v-taxpayers-for-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111175\"><a href=\"/opinion/111175/members-of-city-council-of-los-angeles-v-taxpayers-for-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), the Supreme Court discussed facial invalidity\nunder the First Amendment. First, it noted that a statute may be\ndeclared facially invalid if it is \"apparent that any attempt to\nenforce such legislation would create an unacceptable risk of the\nsuppression of ideas.\" Id. at 797, 104 S. Ct. at 2124 (emphasis\nadded). That is plainly not the case here. As the district\ncourt aptly noted under the aid and abet provision,\n     the State could permissibly prohibit, for example, an\n     individual from offering a $500 reward to employers for\n     each time that they refuse to hire a gay or lesbian job\n     applicant because of the applicant's sexual\n     orientation. Such a reward scheme would have little to\n     do with the expression of ideas and could legitimately\n\f     be regulated by the state[.]\n\n902 F. Supp. at 517. Likewise, a person who threatened a\nbusiness if it refused to fire its gay employees could certainly\nbe held liable as a \"coercer\" under the Law Against\nDiscrimination without offending the Speech Clause.\n     Appellants argue that this statute is indeed incapable of\nany constitutional application, relying on Dambrot v. Central\nMich. Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696606\"><a href=\"/opinion/696606/keith-dambrot-plaintiff-appellantcross-appellee-lakeith-boyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1995), and Doe v. University\nof Mich., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1419700\"><a href=\"/opinion/1419700/doe-v-university-of-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Mich. 1989). Those cases,\nhowever, are inapposite. Both involved university \"hate speech\ncodes\" that explicitly purported to regulate speech and other\nprotected First Amendment activity. Because protected activity\nwas the target of these regulations, they had no constitutional\napplication and were thus facially invalid.\n     Nor are we persuaded that City of Houston v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111919\"><a href=\"/opinion/111919/houston-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111919\"><a href=\"/opinion/111919/houston-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), militates towards finding the Law\nAgainst Discrimination facially unconstitutional. In that case,\na municipal ordinance made it \"unlawful for any person to\nassault, strike, or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or\ninterrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty,\" and the\nSupreme Court declared the statute unconstitutional on its face.\nId. at 467, 107 S. Ct. at 2512. Appellants point to the\nunprotected conduct proscribed in that statute and argue that the\nfact that unprotected conduct is likewise regulated by the Law\nAgainst Discrimination cannot therefore foreclose a facial\nchallenge to that statute. A careful reading of Hill, however,\ndiscloses that all of the prohibited conduct in that ordinance\nwas preempted by the state criminal code, leaving only the speech\nrestrictions intact as a matter of state law. That being the\ncase, there were no constitutional applications of the ordinance\nand the Supreme Court invalidated it on facial grounds. Here,\nthe \"conduct\" restrictions are an integral part of New Jersey law\nand have been enforced for most of the last half-century.\nAccordingly, Hill is not dispositive.\n     Second, the Vincent court discussed overbreadth, the other\nway in which a statute might be found facially invalid:\n     [T]he very existence of some broadly written statutes\n     may have such a deterrent effect on free expression\n     that they should be subject to challenge even by a\n     party whose own conduct may be unprotected. The Court\n     has repeatedly held that such a statute may be\n     challenged on its face even though a more narrowly\n     drawn statute would be valid as applied to the party in\n     the case before it. This exception from the general\n     rule is predicated on a judicial prediction or\n     assumption that the statute's very existence may cause\n     others not before the court to refrain from\n     constitutionally protected speech or expression.\n\nId. at 798-99, 104 S. Ct. at 2125 (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, the overbreadth doctrine permits\na litigant whose own activities are unprotected to challenge the\nstatute by claiming that is infringes the rights of others not\n\fbefore the court. In this case, however, appellants make no\nargument that, while their own activities may be unprotected, the\nprotected activities of third parties not before the court might\nbe drawn within the ambit of the Law Against Discrimination.\nRather, it appears that appellants' activities are no different\nfrom those of any other person who might assert a First Amendment\nchallenge to the statute. That is fatal to appellants' claim\nthat the Law Against Discrimination is unconstitutionally\noverbroad. Id. at 801-02, 104 S. Ct. at 2127 (overbreadth\nchallenge inappropriate where it appeared that, if ordinance\ncould be validly applied to plaintiffs, it could be validly\napplied to anybody). Accordingly, we agree with the district\ncourt that appellants have not presented a valid facial challenge\nto the Law Against Discrimination.\n                                B.\n     That leaves appellants with an \"as applied\" challenge to the\nLaw Against Discrimination, specifically appellants' argument\nthat the Law Against Discrimination is an impermissible content-\nbased restriction on speech. The district court apparently\nbelieved that this argument was part of appellants' facial\nchallenge to the statute, since it engaged in a detailed legal\nanalysis of the issue in that section of its opinion. See 902 F.\nSupp. at 517-22.\n     That analysis, however, was unnecessary, and consequently we\nexpress no view as to its correctness. Once the district court\ndetermined that the challenged Law Against Discrimination\nprovisions were capable of some constitutional application and\nthat they are not properly the subject of an overbreadth\nchallenge, there was no remaining issue of facial invalidity to\nbe decided. Rather, whether the Law Against Discrimination was\nan unconstitutional content-based restraint on speech could only\nbe determined within the context of its application to\nappellants. Thus, if the district court correctly abstained from\ndeciding appellants' as applied challenge, its discussion of\nviewpoint discrimination and the secondary effects doctrine was\nunnecessary.\n                                C.\n     We believe that the district court correctly applied\nPullmanabstention. Pullman abstention may be employed \"when a federal\ncourt is presented with both a federal constitutional issue and\nan unsettled issue of state law whose resolution might narrow or\neliminate the federal constitutional question, . . . [thus]\navoid[ing] 'needless friction with state policies.'\" Chez Sez\nIII Corp. v.

As a matter of law, Pullman abstention\nrequires the following special circumstances: (1) uncertain\nissues of state law underlying the federal constitutional claim;\n(2) state law issues subject to state court interpretation that\ncould obviate the need to adjudicate or substantially narrow the\nscope of the federal constitutional claim; and (3) an erroneous\nconstruction of state law by the federal court would disrupt\nimportant state policies. Chez Sez, 945 F.2d at 631; accordHughes v.\nLipscher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543744\"><a href=\"/opinion/543744/marie-williams-hughes-and-joseph-p-hughes-v-robert-d-lipscher/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 964 (3d Cir. 1990). If these\n\fspecial circumstances are all present, the court should make a\n\"discretionary determination\" as to whether abstention is\nappropriate under the circumstances, based on certain \"equitable\nconsiderations.\" Chez Sez, 945 F.2d at 631. We find, as did the\ndistrict court, that all three requirements are met here and that\nabstention is appropriate under these circumstances.\n     First, it is clear that the state law issues are uncertain.\nAlthough there is some evidence that New Jersey would interpret\nthis language in the Law Against Discrimination in the same\nmanner as it does in the criminal law context, see Baliko v.\nStecker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1960480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1960480/baliko-v-stecker/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1223 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1994), the New\nJersey Supreme Court has interpreted the language \"aid, abet,\nincite, compel or coerce\" only once in the context of a First\nAmendment challenge, and that case involved commercial speech.\nSee Passaic Daily News v. Blair, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2055651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2055651/the-passaic-daily-news-v-blair/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J. 1973), in\nwhich the supreme court held that providing sex-segregated\nclassified advertising columns aided employers' acts of sex\ndiscrimination. In sum, we simply do not know how the courts of\nNew Jersey would interpret the \"aid and abet\" language.\n     Second, it is quite possible that the New Jersey courts\nwould construe the challenged language so as to avoid reaching\nthe type of conduct in which Reverend Cummings and others\nsimilarly situated engage. Indeed, the state agency responsible\nfor the statute's enforcement has stipulated that the Law Against\nDiscrimination should not be construed to reach speech protected\nunder the First Amendment. Should the New Jersey courts agree\n(and it indeed appears that the agency's views would be entitled\nto considerable weight, see Blair, 308 A.2d at 654), it is likely\nthat appellants' First Amendment claim would be substantially\nnarrowed, if not eliminated entirely.\n     Third, the potential for disruption of important state\npolicies is manifest. For many decades, the Law Against\nDiscrimination has been a powerful tool in New Jersey's war\nagainst discrimination. Were we to erroneously construe it to\nreach appellants' conduct and then find it violative of the First\nAmendment, we could eviscerate the entire aiding and abetting\nprohibitions, not only for sexual orientation, but for race,\ngender and creed as well. See N.J.S.A. ยง 10:5-12(a).\n     Thus, we conclude that the district court had the power to\nabstain under the Pullman doctrine. Turning to the equitable\nfactors, we also conclude that its application of Pullmanabstention was a\nproper exercise of its discretion. Although\nabstention should generally not be applied to facial challenges,\nthere is no such restriction with respect to an \"as applied\"\nchallenge because there is less of a concern that protected\nactivity will be inhibited if the court abstains from deciding\nthe First Amendment issues. Chez Sez, 945 F.2d at 633-34.\n     Appellants point to the additional delay which they will\nsuffer if they are forced to adjudicate their state law issues in\nthe New Jersey courts, relying on Stretton v. Disciplinary Bd.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567937\"><a href=\"/opinion/567937/samuel-c-stretton-in-91-1439-v-disciplinary-board-of-the-supreme-court-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 (3d Cir. 1991), and Biegenwald v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527802\"><a href=\"/opinion/527802/richard-f-biegenwald-v-william-h-fauver-both-individually-and-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750-51 (3rd Cir. 1989). Stretton, however, involved an\nimminent judicial election and the plaintiff in Biegenwald was\nunder sentence of death. In both cases, abstention threatened\n\fany possibility of relief. The situation here is simply not that\nextreme.\n     Moreover, New Jersey law provides for declaratory relief\nwhen a person is unsure of the application of a statute. SeeN.J.S.A. ยง\n2A:15-53. Thus, appellants had and continue to have\nthe statutory opportunity to obtain a definitive construction of\nthe Law Against Discrimination provisions at issue from the New\nJersey courts. Thus, any delay is at least partly of appellants'\nown making, as they plainly possessed the right to seek a\ndeclaratory judgment in state court from the outset of this\nlitigation and should have realized that federal court abstention\nwas at least a possibility.\n                               III.\n     Because appellants have not presented a valid facial\nchallenge to the Law Against Discrimination and because the\ndistrict court abstained properly from their \"as applied\"\nchallenge, we will affirm.\n\f</pre>",
