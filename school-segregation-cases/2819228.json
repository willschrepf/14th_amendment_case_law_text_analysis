This  appeal   features  a<br>                    SELYA,  Circuit   Judge.<br>                            _______________<br><br>          controversy  between the  parents of  a handicapped  child and  a<br><br>          local  school committee.  Despite the  parents' protests, a state<br><br>          hearing   officer   declared  the   school   committee's  1991-92<br><br>          individualized  education  program  (IEP)  appropriate   for  the<br><br>          child's needs and  in compliance  with federal law.   The  United<br><br>          States  District  Court  for the  District  of  Maine upheld  the<br><br>          finding.  We affirm.<br><br>          I.  BACKGROUND<br>          I.  BACKGROUND<br><br>                    Daniel Lenn, a minor, is handicapped within the meaning<br><br>          of  the Individuals  with Disabilities  Education Act  (IDEA), 20<br><br>          U.S.C.     1400-1485  (1988 &amp;  Supp.  III 1991).1   Daniel  has a<br><br>          severe, non-verbal learning disability connected with the brain's<br><br>          right hemisphere.  While his verbal IQ test scores are average to<br><br>          low  average,  Daniel   has  difficulty  interpreting  non-verbal<br><br>          messages, such  as facial cues.   He has a short  attention span,<br><br>          lacks  the ability to intake, process, or retrieve information in<br><br>          an  organized   way,   possesses  poor   visual   memory,   often<br><br>          misperceives the  world around him, and  pays excessive attention<br><br>          to  small details.   His  disability inhibits  social interaction<br><br>          with peers and impedes academic progress.<br><br>                    Daniel attended the Portland, Maine public schools as a<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1In their complaint, the  plaintiffs also invoke section 504<br>          of  the Rehabilitation Act, 29  U.S.C.   794  (1988).  Concluding<br>          that the sweep  of the two statutes is identical  for purposes of<br>          this  case,  the parties  have  briefed and  argued  their points<br>          solely with  reference to the IDEA.   We assume arguendo that the<br>                                                          ________<br>          parties'  assessment is accurate.  Hence, we analyze the assigned<br>          errors under the IDEA.<br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          special  education student  through the eighth  grade.   While he<br><br>          advanced from year to year,  his attainments fell steadily behind<br><br>          those of  his peers.  His  progress slowed to a  crawl during the<br><br>          1989-90  and  1990-91 school  years.   By  July 1991,  Daniel had<br><br>          completed  the  eighth  grade;  nevertheless,  his  reading   and<br><br>          mathematical calculation  scores were  at  roughly a  sixth-grade<br><br>          level  and his score in applied mathematics was at a second-grade<br><br>          level.<br><br>                    Daniel's eighth-grade year (1990-91) was interrupted by<br><br>          a  one-month  midwinter  hospital  stay,  during  which  treating<br><br>          professionals illuminated the nature  and extent of his cognitive<br><br>          disability.  That July,  Daniel's parents placed him in  a summer<br><br>          program at Eagle Hill,  a private school in Massachusetts.   They<br><br>          also contacted the Cleveland Clinic  and arranged to have  Daniel<br><br>          undergo  a series  of additional  educational, neurological,  and<br><br>          psychological  examinations.     Relying  in  part   on  the  new<br><br>          information generated through  the Lenns'  efforts, the  Portland<br><br>          School  Committee (Portland) shifted  gears, scrapped  several of<br><br>          its earlier  (unsuccessful) approaches,  and proposed an  IEP for<br><br>          Daniel's   ninth-grade   education    that   contained    several<br><br>          innovations.  Nevertheless, Daniel's parents rejected the public-<br><br>          school-based program, unilaterally enrolled Daniel as a full-time<br><br>          residential  student at Eagle  Hill,2 and requested  a hearing on<br><br>          the IEP's adequacy.<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2Daniel is  still  in residence  at  Eagle Hill,  albeit  at<br>          considerable expense to the Lenns.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    After pondering testimony  from eighteen witnesses  and<br><br>          reviewing numerous exhibits, the  state hearing officer concluded<br><br>          that  Portland's IEP for the 1991-92  school year was \"reasonably<br><br>          calculated  to  be  of  significant  educational  benefit  in  an<br><br>          environment  which is  much  less restrictive  than Eagle  Hill.\"<br><br>          Accordingly, he  rejected the  Lenns' remonstrance.   The federal<br><br>          district  court upheld  the  agency determination.   This  appeal<br><br>          ensued.3<br><br>          II.  STATUTORY OVERVIEW<br>          II.

The Act sets more modest goals:  it<br><br>          emphasizes an  appropriate, rather  than an ideal,  education; it<br><br>          requires   an   adequate,   rather   than   an   optimal,    IEP.<br><br>          Appropriateness and adequacy are terms of moderation.  It follows<br><br>          that, although an IEP must afford some educational benefit to the<br><br>          handicapped  child,  the benefit  conferred  need  not reach  the<br><br>          highest attainable level or even the level needed to maximize the<br><br>          child's  potential.

CLAIMED ERRORS OF LAW<br><br>                    In an  effort to  sidestep clear-error review  and take<br><br>          shelter  in the lee of  a more accommodating  standard, the Lenns<br><br>          attribute two  errors of law  to the  court below.   They contend<br><br>          that  the court (1) applied  the wrong legal  yardstick in taking<br><br>          the  measure of  the hearing officer's  findings; and  (2) failed<br><br>          sufficiently to address each  of Daniel's identified  educational<br><br>          needs in determining the adequacy of Portland's proposed IEP.

The claim<br><br>          founders:   the  record  below contains  all  the earmarks  of  a<br><br>          suitably deferential, yet suitably independent, judicial inquiry.<br><br>                    The linchpin of this conclusion is the district court's<br><br>          opinion.  In it,  Judge Brody explains a reviewing  court's duty,<br><br>          canvasses  the   pertinent  authorities,  and   acknowledges  the<br><br>          relationship  between  the  hearing  officer's findings  and  the<br><br>          district court's oversight function, concluding that  \"while [the<br><br>          district]  court must  make an  independent ruling,  [its] review<br><br>          must  be something  short of  de novo.\"   Lenn  v.  Portland Sch.<br>                                        __ ____     ____      _____________<br><br>          Comm., No.  92-0011-P-H, slip op. at 6 (D. Me. Dec. 14, 1992) (D.<br>          _____<br><br>          Ct. Op.).  The court's discussion could hardly be more pointed or<br><br>          more accurate.<br><br>                    In  the face of this pellucid prose, appellants have an<br><br>          uphill battle.  They argue that, although the district judge gave<br><br>          lip  service  to the  correct  standard, he  actually  viewed the<br><br>          evidence through  a much  more deferential  glass.   We recognize<br><br>          that  actions sometimes speak louder  than words.   Thus, a trial<br><br>          court  cannot satisfy its oversight obligation in an IDEA case by<br><br>          reciting the catechism of independent review and  then failing to<br><br>          practice  what it  preaches.   But when,  as now,  a  trial court<br><br>          delineates the proper  rule of decision,  citing book and  verse,<br><br>          the burden  of demonstrating  that the court  is merely  mouthing<br><br><br>                                          9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          empty platitudes rests with the party who mounts the  accusation.<br><br>          This  is  a  heavy burden;  it  cannot  be  carried by  perfervid<br><br>          rhetoric  or glib wordplay.   To  prevail on  such a  theory, the<br><br>          accuser  must offer solid indications  that the district court in<br><br>          fact  strayed  from  the straight  and  narrow.    After all,  an<br><br>          appellate tribunal  ought not lightly assume that a federal trial<br><br>          judge  is  indulging in  the adjudicatory  equivalent of  a shell<br><br>          game.<br><br>                    In  this instance,  we  think the  accusation that  the<br><br>          judge said one  thing, but did another, is unfounded.  The Lenns'<br><br>          most touted point  is their asseveration that  the district court<br><br>          expressly  invoked the clear-error standard when  it noted that a<br><br>          court  is \"not confined to the hearing officer's decision if [it]<br><br>          find[s] clear error.\"  D. Ct. Op. at 10.  Based primarily on this<br><br>          remark,4 appellants invite us  to disregard the court's professed<br><br>          allegiance to the  correct standard  of review.   We decline  the<br><br>          invitation.<br><br>                    First and foremost, we simply cannot credit appellants'<br><br>          argument  that  this  isolated  reference  indicates  a wholesale<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               4The district court also wrote that it found \"ample evidence<br>          in the record\" to support the hearing officer's decision.  D. Ct.<br>          Op. at 10.   Appellants  argue that this  statement manifests  an<br>          abandonment  of  the  preponderance-of-the-evidence test.    This<br>          argument  proves  nothing  more  than  appellants'  penchant  for<br>          grasping  at straws    especially since  the context  makes clear<br>          that the lower court applied the proper test; indeed, in the very<br>          same  paragraph  of  its  opinion,  the  court  used  the  phrase<br>          \"preponderance  of the evidence.\"   Id.  We  will neither confine<br>                                              ___<br>          district courts to the rote recitation of buzzwords  nor penalize<br>          them   for  relieving  the  tedium  of  opinion  writing  by  the<br>          occasional employment of artful synonyms.<br><br>                                          10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          abandonment of the principles of independent review.  We think it<br><br>          is  far more likely, all things considered, that the reference to<br><br>          \"clear error\" represents simply an infelicitous choice of phrase.<br><br>          Indeed, a close perusal of the record makes manifest the depth of<br><br>          judicial  involvement and  provides  clinching evidence  that the<br><br>          district  judge  utilized  the approved  level  of  review.   The<br><br>          transcript reveals that the judge took a hands-on approach to the<br><br>          decisional process.  Instead of limiting his perscrutation to the<br><br>          administrative  record, he  conducted  what amounted  to a  mini-<br><br>          trial, hearing testimony  from two  witnesses regarding  Daniel's<br><br>          educational  needs  and  receiving  newly  emergent documentation<br><br>          chronicling  Daniel's progress  at  Eagle Hill.   The  judge then<br><br>          carefully scrutinized all the evidence, new and old, and drew his<br><br>          own conclusions  from  it.   This is  the very  stuff from  which<br><br>          independent review is fashioned.<br><br>                    We have said enough.  The law does not require district<br><br>          courts to be precise to the point of pedantry.   Consequently, an<br><br>          appellate court must  not hesitate to excuse  an awkward locution<br><br>          and give  a busy trial judge  a bit of breathing room.   If using<br><br>          the  wrong word  or phrase  constituted grounds  for reversal  in<br><br>          every  case, much  too high  a premium  would be placed  on sheer<br><br>          literalism.

The Act does not  mandate, nor<br><br>          has any court held  it to require, that  the district judge  must<br><br>          consider  each  unique  need in  isolation  and  make a  separate<br><br>          finding regarding the  preponderance of the evidence in  each and<br><br><br>                                          15<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          every  identified area.

We<br><br>          hold that no such requirement exists.  In the last analysis, what<br><br>          matters  is  not whether  the district  judge  makes a  series of<br><br>          segregable findings,  but whether the  judge is cognizant  of all<br><br>          the  child's special needs and considers the IEP's offerings as a<br><br>          unitary whole, taking those special needs into proper account.<br><br>                    The   record   also  belies   appellants'  self-serving<br><br>          suggestion  that  the district  court assessed  Daniel's academic<br><br>          needs in  a vacuum.    A trial court charged  with evaluating the<br><br>          adequacy of an  IEP cannot be said to  have committed legal error<br><br>          as long as (1)  it does not overlook  or misconstrue evidence  of<br><br>          record,  and (2) its overall decision is based upon a supportable<br><br>          finding  that the  program  described in  the  IEP is  reasonably<br><br>          calculated to address  the handicapped child's  education-related<br><br>          needs,  both academic  and  non-academic.   The district  court's<br><br>          finding in this  case fits  comfortably within that  rubric.   We<br><br>          explain briefly.<br><br>                    The  district  court explicitly  acknowledged \"Daniel's<br><br>          self-esteem and social skills  needs\" and took pains to  limn the<br><br>          \"wide  range  of  after-school   support  services\"  proposed  by<br><br>          Portland  to  address those  needs.    D.  Ct.  Op.  at  8.    In<br><br>          considering  the  likely  impact  of these  services,  the  court<br><br>          focused on Portland's plan to provide a social skills facilitator<br><br>          and opined that, although  hiring a facilitator might not  be the<br><br><br>                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          best mechanism for addressing Daniel's needs, \"the ideal\" is  not<br><br>          \"the legal standard under [the]  IDEA.\"  Id. at 10; see  also id.<br>                                                   ___        ___  ____ ___<br><br>          at  12.

WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE<br><br>                    Appellants' final  assignment of error posits  that the<br><br>          district court blundered in  concluding that Portland's IEP would<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               7We do not accept appellants' hypothesis that the mainstream<br>          nature of a proposed  placement can never enter into  the primary<br>          analysis  of an  IEP's  adequacy.   When  a child,  like  Daniel,<br>          demonstrates a particular need for  learning how to interact with<br>          non-disabled peers, a mainstream placement will almost inevitably<br>          help to  address that need.   Such an  integral aspect of  an IEP<br>          package  cannot be  ignored  when judging  the program's  overall<br>          adequacy and appropriateness.   The Third Circuit, which recently<br>          reaffirmed the  special nature  of the educational  benefits that<br>          mainstream  programs confer,  apparently shares  this view.   See<br>                                                                        ___<br>          Oberti v.

Portland's<br>          witnesses  and  plaintiffs'  experts  expressed  widely divergent<br>          views  on this  topic.

In<br>          fact, the IEP affords Daniel an individualized physical education<br>          program  as   well  as  a  choice   of  extracurricular  athletic<br>          activities.   Since the record  fails to demonstrate  that Daniel<br>          suffers an  infirmity in  motor coordination or  personal hygiene<br>          that  would  require  specially  designed programs,  no  more  is<br>          required.<br><br>               11Significantly, teachers who  had previously taught  Daniel<br>          in large,  mainstream classes  testified that he  participated in<br>          class activities,  did  well,  felt  good  about  his  work,  and<br>          achieved passing grades.<br><br>                                          20<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          supportive parents,  to be educated with  non-disabled peers, and<br><br>          to  interact regularly with the  members of his  community.12  It<br><br>          follows  inexorably  that   the  district  court's  findings   of<br><br>          appropriateness  and  adequacy  comfortably  survive  clear-error<br><br>          review.<br><br>          V.

Its  conclusion that Portland's  proposed 1991-92<br><br>          IEP meets Daniel's  needs is supported by the record.

Despite the  parents' protests, a state<br><br>          hearing   officer   declared  the   school   committee's  1991-92<br><br>          individualized  education  program  (IEP)  appropriate   for  the<br><br>          child's needs and  in compliance  with federal law.   The  United<br><br>          States  District  Court  for the  District  of  Maine upheld  the<br><br>          finding.  We affirm.<br><br>          I.  BACKGROUND<br>          I.  BACKGROUND<br><br>                    Daniel Lenn, a minor, is handicapped within the meaning<br><br>          of  the Individuals  with Disabilities  Education Act  (IDEA), 20<br><br>          U.S.C.     1400-1485  (1988 &amp;  Supp.  III 1991).1   Daniel  has a<br><br>          severe, non-verbal learning disability connected with the brain's<br><br>          right hemisphere.  While his verbal IQ test scores are average to<br><br>          low  average,  Daniel   has  difficulty  interpreting  non-verbal<br><br>          messages, such  as facial cues.   He has a short  attention span,<br><br>          lacks  the ability to intake, process, or retrieve information in<br><br>          an  organized   way,   possesses  poor   visual   memory,   often<br><br>          misperceives the  world around him, and  pays excessive attention<br><br>          to  small details.   His  disability inhibits  social interaction<br><br>          with peers and impedes academic progress.<br><br>                    Daniel attended the Portland, Maine public schools as a<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1In their complaint, the  plaintiffs also invoke section 504<br>          of  the Rehabilitation Act, 29  U.S.C.   794  (1988).  Concluding<br>          that the sweep  of the two statutes is identical  for purposes of<br>          this  case,  the parties  have  briefed and  argued  their points<br>          solely with  reference to the IDEA.   We assume arguendo that the<br>                                                          ________<br>          parties'  assessment is accurate.  Hence, we analyze the assigned<br>          errors under the IDEA.<br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          special  education student  through the eighth  grade.   While he<br><br>          advanced from year to year,  his attainments fell steadily behind<br><br>          those of  his peers.  His  progress slowed to a  crawl during the<br><br>          1989-90  and  1990-91 school  years.   By  July 1991,  Daniel had<br><br>          completed  the  eighth  grade;  nevertheless,  his  reading   and<br><br>          mathematical calculation  scores were  at  roughly a  sixth-grade<br><br>          level  and his score in applied mathematics was at a second-grade<br><br>          level.<br><br>                    Daniel's eighth-grade year (1990-91) was interrupted by<br><br>          a  one-month  midwinter  hospital  stay,  during  which  treating<br><br>          professionals illuminated the nature  and extent of his cognitive<br><br>          disability.  That July,  Daniel's parents placed him in  a summer<br><br>          program at Eagle Hill,  a private school in Massachusetts.   They<br><br>          also contacted the Cleveland Clinic  and arranged to have  Daniel<br><br>          undergo  a series  of additional  educational, neurological,  and<br><br>          psychological  examinations.     Relying  in  part   on  the  new<br><br>          information generated through  the Lenns'  efforts, the  Portland<br><br>          School  Committee (Portland) shifted  gears, scrapped  several of<br><br>          its earlier  (unsuccessful) approaches,  and proposed an  IEP for<br><br>          Daniel's   ninth-grade   education    that   contained    several<br><br>          innovations.  Nevertheless, Daniel's parents rejected the public-<br><br>          school-based program, unilaterally enrolled Daniel as a full-time<br><br>          residential  student at Eagle  Hill,2 and requested  a hearing on<br><br>          the IEP's adequacy.<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2Daniel is  still  in residence  at  Eagle Hill,  albeit  at<br>          considerable expense to the Lenns.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    After pondering testimony  from eighteen witnesses  and<br><br>          reviewing numerous exhibits, the  state hearing officer concluded<br><br>          that  Portland's IEP for the 1991-92  school year was \"reasonably<br><br>          calculated  to  be  of  significant  educational  benefit  in  an<br><br>          environment  which is  much  less restrictive  than Eagle  Hill.\"<br><br>          Accordingly, he  rejected the  Lenns' remonstrance.   The federal<br><br>          district  court upheld  the  agency determination.   This  appeal<br><br>          ensued.3<br><br>          II.  STATUTORY OVERVIEW<br>          II.

The claim<br><br>          founders:   the  record  below contains  all  the earmarks  of  a<br><br>          suitably deferential, yet suitably independent, judicial inquiry.<br><br>                    The linchpin of this conclusion is the district court's<br><br>          opinion.  In it,  Judge Brody explains a reviewing  court's duty,<br><br>          canvasses  the   pertinent  authorities,  and   acknowledges  the<br><br>          relationship  between  the  hearing  officer's findings  and  the<br><br>          district court's oversight function, concluding that  \"while [the<br><br>          district]  court must  make an  independent ruling,  [its] review<br><br>          must  be something  short of  de novo.\"   Lenn  v.

Dec. 14, 1992) (D.<br>          _____<br><br>          Ct. Op.).  The court's discussion could hardly be more pointed or<br><br>          more accurate.<br><br>                    In  the face of this pellucid prose, appellants have an<br><br>          uphill battle.  They argue that, although the district judge gave<br><br>          lip  service  to the  correct  standard, he  actually  viewed the<br><br>          evidence through  a much  more deferential  glass.   We recognize<br><br>          that  actions sometimes speak louder  than words.   Thus, a trial<br><br>          court  cannot satisfy its oversight obligation in an IDEA case by<br><br>          reciting the catechism of independent review and  then failing to<br><br>          practice  what it  preaches.   But when,  as now,  a  trial court<br><br>          delineates the proper  rule of decision,  citing book and  verse,<br><br>          the burden  of demonstrating  that the court  is merely  mouthing<br><br><br>                                          9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          empty platitudes rests with the party who mounts the  accusation.<br><br>          This  is  a  heavy burden;  it  cannot  be  carried by  perfervid<br><br>          rhetoric  or glib wordplay.   To  prevail on  such a  theory, the<br><br>          accuser  must offer solid indications  that the district court in<br><br>          fact  strayed  from  the straight  and  narrow.    After all,  an<br><br>          appellate tribunal  ought not lightly assume that a federal trial<br><br>          judge  is  indulging in  the adjudicatory  equivalent of  a shell<br><br>          game.<br><br>                    In  this instance,  we  think the  accusation that  the<br><br>          judge said one  thing, but did another, is unfounded.  The Lenns'<br><br>          most touted point  is their asseveration that  the district court<br><br>          expressly  invoked the clear-error standard when  it noted that a<br><br>          court  is \"not confined to the hearing officer's decision if [it]<br><br>          find[s] clear error.\"  D. Ct. Op. at 10.  Based primarily on this<br><br>          remark,4 appellants invite us  to disregard the court's professed<br><br>          allegiance to the  correct standard  of review.   We decline  the<br><br>          invitation.<br><br>                    First and foremost, we simply cannot credit appellants'<br><br>          argument  that  this  isolated  reference  indicates  a wholesale<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               4The district court also wrote that it found \"ample evidence<br>          in the record\" to support the hearing officer's decision.  D. Ct.<br>          Op. at 10.   Appellants  argue that this  statement manifests  an<br>          abandonment  of  the  preponderance-of-the-evidence test.    This<br>          argument  proves  nothing  more  than  appellants'  penchant  for<br>          grasping  at straws    especially since  the context  makes clear<br>          that the lower court applied the proper test; indeed, in the very<br>          same  paragraph  of  its  opinion,  the  court  used  the  phrase<br>          \"preponderance  of the evidence.\"   Id.  We  will neither confine<br>                                              ___<br>          district courts to the rote recitation of buzzwords  nor penalize<br>          them   for  relieving  the  tedium  of  opinion  writing  by  the<br>          occasional employment of artful synonyms.<br><br>                                          10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          abandonment of the principles of independent review.  We think it<br><br>          is  far more likely, all things considered, that the reference to<br><br>          \"clear error\" represents simply an infelicitous choice of phrase.<br><br>          Indeed, a close perusal of the record makes manifest the depth of<br><br>          judicial  involvement and  provides  clinching evidence  that the<br><br>          district  judge  utilized  the approved  level  of  review.   The<br><br>          transcript reveals that the judge took a hands-on approach to the<br><br>          decisional process.  Instead of limiting his perscrutation to the<br><br>          administrative  record, he  conducted  what amounted  to a  mini-<br><br>          trial, hearing testimony  from two  witnesses regarding  Daniel's<br><br>          educational  needs  and  receiving  newly  emergent documentation<br><br>          chronicling  Daniel's progress  at  Eagle Hill.   The  judge then<br><br>          carefully scrutinized all the evidence, new and old, and drew his<br><br>          own conclusions  from  it.   This is  the very  stuff from  which<br><br>          independent review is fashioned.<br><br>                    We have said enough.  The law does not require district<br><br>          courts to be precise to the point of pedantry.   Consequently, an<br><br>          appellate court must  not hesitate to excuse  an awkward locution<br><br>          and give  a busy trial judge  a bit of breathing room.   If using<br><br>          the  wrong word  or phrase  constituted grounds  for reversal  in<br><br>          every  case, much  too high  a premium  would be placed  on sheer<br><br>          literalism.

Hence, we find no warping of the standard of review.  We<br><br>          hasten to add,  however, that  even if  the controversial  phrase<br><br>          represents  more than  a slip  of the  district court's  pen    a<br><br>          supposition  that we  deem  unsubstantiated    the reference,  by<br><br>          itself,  does   not  call   into  question  the   court's  proper<br><br>          performance of its oversight function.<br><br>                                          B<br>                                          B<br><br>                    Appellants next  assert that  the  district court  must<br><br>          \"determine  separately for  each area  of  identified educational<br><br>          need . . . whether, by  a preponderance of the evidence, [an IEP]<br><br>          addresses that  need\" sufficiently.   Appellants' Reply  Brief at<br><br>          11.   Building on this premise, appellants then conclude that the<br><br>          court below  emasculated the  requirement by failing  to consider<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               6While the Lenns grudgingly acknowledge this reference, they<br>          maintain that the  court erred  by requiring them  to prove  that<br>          only Eagle Hill will provide Daniel with an appropriate education<br>          ____<br>          when,   in  fact,   their   burden  was   merely  to   prove  the<br>          inappropriateness of  Portland's  IEP.   On  balance, we  do  not<br>          believe it can fairly  be said that the court  misapprehended the<br>          contours  of  the issue.    Throughout  its pages,  the  district<br>          court's  opinion  is  geared   toward  determining  whether  \"the<br>          proposed  IEP  was  reasonably  calculated to  enable  Daniel  to<br>          receive educational benefits.\"   D.

The Act does not  mandate, nor<br><br>          has any court held  it to require, that  the district judge  must<br><br>          consider  each  unique  need in  isolation  and  make a  separate<br><br>          finding regarding the  preponderance of the evidence in  each and<br><br><br>                                          15<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          every  identified area.  Such a requirement would serve merely to<br><br>          balkanize the  concept of educational  benefit and to  burden the<br><br>          district courts without producing  any offsetting advantages.  We<br><br>          hold that no such requirement exists.  In the last analysis, what<br><br>          matters  is  not whether  the district  judge  makes a  series of<br><br>          segregable findings,  but whether the  judge is cognizant  of all<br><br>          the  child's special needs and considers the IEP's offerings as a<br><br>          unitary whole, taking those special needs into proper account.<br><br>                    The   record   also  belies   appellants'  self-serving<br><br>          suggestion  that  the district  court assessed  Daniel's academic<br><br>          needs in  a vacuum.    A trial court charged  with evaluating the<br><br>          adequacy of an  IEP cannot be said to  have committed legal error<br><br>          as long as (1)  it does not overlook  or misconstrue evidence  of<br><br>          record,  and (2) its overall decision is based upon a supportable<br><br>          finding  that the  program  described in  the  IEP is  reasonably<br><br>          calculated to address  the handicapped child's  education-related<br><br>          needs,  both academic  and  non-academic.   The district  court's<br><br>          finding in this  case fits  comfortably within that  rubric.   We<br><br>          explain briefly.<br><br>                    The  district  court explicitly  acknowledged \"Daniel's<br><br>          self-esteem and social skills  needs\" and took pains to  limn the<br><br>          \"wide  range  of  after-school   support  services\"  proposed  by<br><br>          Portland  to  address those  needs.    D.  Ct.  Op.  at  8.    In<br><br>          considering  the  likely  impact  of these  services,  the  court<br><br>          focused on Portland's plan to provide a social skills facilitator<br><br>          and opined that, although  hiring a facilitator might not  be the<br><br><br>                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          best mechanism for addressing Daniel's needs, \"the ideal\" is  not<br><br>          \"the legal standard under [the]  IDEA.\"  Id. at 10; see  also id.<br>                                                   ___        ___  ____ ___<br><br>          at  12.

When  a child,  like  Daniel,<br>          demonstrates a particular need for  learning how to interact with<br>          non-disabled peers, a mainstream placement will almost inevitably<br>          help to  address that need.   Such an  integral aspect of  an IEP<br>          package  cannot be  ignored  when judging  the program's  overall<br>          adequacy and appropriateness.   The Third Circuit, which recently<br>          reaffirmed the  special nature  of the educational  benefits that<br>          mainstream  programs confer,  apparently shares  this view.

Board of Educ., ___ F.2d ___, ___ (3d  Cir. 1993) [1993<br>          ______    ______________<br>          WL  178480, *9]  (observing  that, in  assessing the  educational<br>          benefit  of placing  a  handicapped  child  with  non-handicapped<br>          peers,  \"the  court must  pay special  attention to  those unique<br>          benefits  the child  may  obtain from  integration  in a  regular<br>          classroom  .   .  .,   i.e.,  the  development   of  social   and<br>                                 ____<br>          communication skills from interaction with nondisabled peers\").<br><br>                                          17<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          provide Daniel with an appropriate public education.  We  discern<br><br>          no clear error.   To  the contrary, the  record fully sustains  a<br><br>          finding that Portland's IEP is adequate and appropriate to ensure<br><br>          the requisite degree of educational benefit.<br><br>                    On this score, appellants' cardinal contention is  that<br><br>          Portland's  IEP  fails to  take  account  of Daniel's  inadequate<br><br>          social  skills.   We demur.   The  record  reflects that  the IEP<br><br>          forthrightly  addresses  this  area of  critical  need,  offering<br><br>          Daniel  an array  of  after-school socialization  services.   For<br><br>          example, Daniel would spend three hours a day, three days a week,<br><br>          with a social skills facilitator, who would encourage and oversee<br><br>          his   involvement   in   extracurricular    and   community-based<br><br>          activities.   The facilitator would  work to hone Daniel's skills<br><br>          in  relating to non-disabled peers  in a real-world  milieu.8  On<br><br>          the  remaining school  days, Daniel  would receive  social skills<br><br>          programming  in  more   structured  environments,  spending   one<br><br>          afternoon at  a one-on-one  counseling session with  a doctorate-<br><br>          level psychologist  and the other  in the company  of handicapped<br><br>          peers  at  a  group  counseling session  devoted  to  self-esteem<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               8To be sure, there is room for principled disagreement about<br>          the  efficacy  of  a   social  skills  facilitator.    Portland's<br>          witnesses  and  plaintiffs'  experts  expressed  widely divergent<br>          views  on this  topic.   But,  judges  are not  especially  well-<br>          equipped  to choose  between  various educational  methodologies.<br>          See  Rowley,  458  U.S. at  207-08.   Where,  as  here,  there is<br>          ___  ______<br>          satisfactory  record  support  for  the  appropriateness  of  the<br>          particular  approach  selected  by  the   school  department  and<br>          approved by the state education  agency, a reviewing court should<br>          not  meddle.   See  id.;  see also  Roland  M., 910  F.2d  at 992<br>                         ___  ___   ___ ____  __________<br>          (warning that \"courts should  be loathe to intrude very  far into<br>          interstitial details or to  become embroiled in captious disputes<br>          as to the precise efficacy of different instructional programs\").<br><br>                                          18<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          issues.  Thus, while  Portland's IEP may not contain  the precise<br><br>          programs  that the  parents  prefer, it  embodies a  substantial,<br><br>          suitably diverse socialization component.<br><br>                    On the academic side, the IEP places Daniel in a small,<br><br>          special education class for English (with a student/teacher ratio<br><br>          of  eight-to-three)  and   four  mainstream  educational  courses<br><br>          (ranging in size  from fifteen to  eighteen students per  class).<br><br>          In  the  mainstream classes  (at least  three  of which  would be<br><br>          taught or  co-taught by a  special educator), Daniel  would study<br><br>          Western  civilization,  mathematics,9 science,  and  an elective.<br><br>          The  special English class would occupy the first period of every<br><br>          day and  would prepare Daniel organizationally  for the remainder<br><br>          of the  day.  A small  group session held during  the last period<br><br>          would  help  Daniel  synthesize   the  day's  lessons,  hone  his<br><br>          organizational  skills,   and  teach  him   homework  strategies.<br><br>          Portland  also offered  (1) personalized  instruction in  custom-<br><br>          tailored  learning techniques, on a daily basis, to assist Daniel<br><br>          in mastering the curriculum; and (2) a home/school coordinator to<br><br>          work  once a  week with  Daniel's mother  to synthesize  home and<br><br>          institutional instruction.<br><br>                    Under federal law, Portland's  IEP package must  assure<br><br>          Daniel a \"basic floor of [educational] opportunity.\"  Rowley, 458<br>                                                                ______<br><br>          U.S. at 201 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Since the record  fails to demonstrate  that Daniel<br>          suffers an  infirmity in  motor coordination or  personal hygiene<br>          that  would  require  specially  designed programs,  no  more  is<br>          required.<br><br>               11Significantly, teachers who  had previously taught  Daniel<br>          in large,  mainstream classes  testified that he  participated in<br>          class activities,  did  well,  felt  good  about  his  work,  and<br>          achieved passing grades.<br><br>                                          20<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          supportive parents,  to be educated with  non-disabled peers, and<br><br>          to  interact regularly with the  members of his  community.12  It<br><br>          follows  inexorably  that   the  district  court's  findings   of<br><br>          appropriateness  and  adequacy  comfortably  survive  clear-error<br><br>          review.<br><br>          V.
