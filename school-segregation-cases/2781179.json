In twenty-five issues, appellant raises points of error concerning the legal and\r\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence, the four-year statute of limitations, waiver, ambiguity\r\nof the contract language, charge error, lack of credit for additional rent paid, the award of\r\nattorney's fees, and error by the trial court in granting a new trial after an earlier jury verdict\r\nin favor of appellant.  As modified, we will affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part\r\non the issue of attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury found damages on behalf of plaintiffs below, appellees, Martin P. Garza,\r\nJr., Abel N. Gonzalez, Jr., and Aida Graciela Gonzalez.  Although appellees pleaded and\r\nsecured findings of fraud and breach of contract, they elected to recover on their contract\r\nclaims.  The contract claims were based upon a series of ground leases for an easement. \r\nThe leases provided for a base rental plus 1.66% \"additional rent.\"  The jury found a\r\nbreach of the lease and awarded damages on an annual basis dating back to 1985.  The\r\ndamages were awarded per annum for sixteen years through 2001, plus the first two\r\nmonths of 2002.  They totaled $2,863,222.63 each for the two groups of appellees. \r\nAttorney's fees were also awarded in the amount of $2,061,520.30 through trial, plus\r\nadditional amounts in the event of appeals.  One juror did not sign the verdict form.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t1. Breach of Contract</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first issue, appellant asserts the trial court erred by overruling its motion for\r\ndirected verdict regarding breach of contract.  In its second issue, appellant charges error\r\nbecause the trial court denied its motion for new trial on the breach of contract issues.  In\r\nissue fifteen, appellant contends there was error because the trial court refused a directed\r\nverdict on the statute of limitations.  In issue twenty, appellant contends the trial court erred\r\nin denying its motion for new trial on the basis that there was no evidence of contractual\r\ndamages.  Appellant argues these matters together and we will likewise address these\r\nmatters together, first as to breach of contract, and then as to the statute of limitations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees contend these and other issues were waived because appellant failed to\r\ncomply with Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(h) concerning the requisites for briefs. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Appellant, in its reply brief, seeks to satisfy this requirement\r\nby providing additional authority addressing appellees' complaints.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have been instructed  that appellate courts should not dismiss an appeal for a\r\nprocedural defect whenever any arguable interpretation of the Rules of Appellate\r\nProcedure would preserve the appeal.  <em>Verburgt v. Dorner</em>, 959 S.W.2d 615, 617 (Tex.\r\n1997).  Our decisions should reflect the policy embodied in our appellate rules that\r\ndisfavors disposing of appeals based upon harmless procedural defects.  <em>Id</em>.  Thus, we\r\nshould reasonably and liberally construe the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure so that\r\nthe right to appeal is not lost by imposing requirements not absolutely necessary to effect\r\nthe purpose of a rule.  <em>Id.</em>;  <em>cf. Borg-Warner Corp. v. Flores</em>, 153 S.W.3d 209, 218 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 2004, pet. filed) (issue of factual sufficiency not preserved where\r\nappellant failed to provide appellate court with any statement of the law regarding same). \r\nWe find that appellant has minimally met the requirements to preserve its issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant contends no evidence was presented that it breached the lease terms. \r\nIt contends that no grain sales were conducted at the Rio Grande City facility, the location\r\nof the leased premises.  Instead, it claims that sales of grain were conducted at its facility\r\nin McCook, Texas.  The sales of grain at McCook were not \"derived from, arising out of,\r\nor payable on account of\" grain transfer activities that admittedly occurred at Rio Grande\r\nCity.  Several of appellant's witnesses testified to this effect.  Further, the numerous grain\r\nsales invoices introduced into evidence had the letter \"M\" on them indicating, according to\r\nappellant, that the sales originated at McCook and not Rio Grande City.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees counter that the lease language defined \"gross sales\" as the \"dollar value\r\nof all sales of goods, services, or combination thereof, and all revenue of every kind and\r\ncharacter derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of a business or business\r\nactivities conducted on the sales premises. . . .\"  Appellees' witnesses, Garza and\r\nGonzalez, testified that the grain invoices reflected appellant's sales.  These numerous\r\ndocuments were summarized.  One derivative exhibit, admitted by agreement, reflected\r\nthe gross sales of all business activity that went through the Rio Grande City facility.  The\r\nevidence also indicated that Rio Grande City was pivotal to appellant's very successful\r\ngrain sales to Mexican markets.  The Rio Grande City facility allowed oversized Mexican\r\ntrucks to load grain in the United States then traverse the border without the necessity of\r\ntraveling on state highways where the use of these larger trucks was prohibited.  A former\r\nexecutive vice president for appellant, Norma Myers, testified that Rio Grande City\r\ngenerated the sales documents and conducted related activities supporting the grain sales\r\nat the site.  She stated the Rio Grande City facility was appellant's selling point for grain\r\nto Mexico.  Before appellant had the facility, it did not sell grain to Mexico.  Once the Rio\r\nGrande City facility opened, appellant became one of the biggest grain sellers to Mexico. \r\nOne of appellant's directors spent seventy to eighty per cent of his time at the facility and\r\nmet, often daily, with Mexican grain customers at the Rio Grande City facility.  Myers\r\ntestified that most of the sales were made out of this facility, not McCook.  Appellant's\r\nsales representative for Mexico also worked out of the facility.  The invoices indicated the\r\nbusiness activity originated from Rio Grande City, and not McCook or Brownsville.  In sum,\r\nthe record reflects that many of the material operative facts were hotly contested by the\r\nparties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMyers further testified she was instructed to only show appellees the scale tickets\r\nand not the actual sales invoices.  In an affidavit submitted in a preliminary matter in the\r\ncase, appellant's general manager swore the company would lose $70,000 per day if the\r\nRio Grande City facility were shut down.  At trial, the manager qualified the prior affidavit\r\nlanguage to say the company was not making that much money per day, and that the\r\nfigure included \"people breaking contracts and our suppliers' trucks being parked outside\r\nand we couldn't get them in.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant criticizes the testimony of Myers because she left the company in March\r\nof 1996.  According to some of appellant's witnesses, she was a disgruntled employee and\r\nleft on bad terms.  This too was disputed.  Myers was also to receive three percent of any\r\nrecovery for additional rent payments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA court may instruct a verdict if no evidence of probative force raises a fact issue\r\non the material questions in the suit.<em>  Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Fin. Review Servs., Inc.</em>,\r\n29 S.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex. 2000).  A directed verdict for a defendant is proper in two\r\nsituations.  First, a court may direct a verdict when a plaintiff fails to raise a fact issue\r\nessential to the plaintiff's right of recovery.  <em>Id.</em>  Second, a trial court may direct a verdict\r\nfor the defendant if  the evidence conclusively establishes a defense to the plaintiff's cause\r\nof action.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence outlined above reveals that appellees adequately raised fact issues\r\non their contract claims. <em>Id.; see also City of Keller v. Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex.\r\n2005) (challenge to the legal sufficiency of evidence will be sustained when, among other\r\nthings, the evidence offered to establish a vital fact does not exceed a scintilla); <em>Kroger\r\nTexas Ltd. Partnership v. Subaru</em>, 2006 Tex. LEXIS 441, at *9, 49 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 592 \r\n(Tex. May 5, 2006).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its second issue, appellant again contends the trial court erred by denying its\r\nmotion for new trial on the breach of contract issues.  A trial court's denial of a motion for\r\nnew trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  <em>See Pharo v. Chambers County</em>, 922 S.W.2d\r\n945, 947 (Tex.1996).  In determining whether an abuse of discretion has occurred, we view\r\nthe evidence in a light most favorable to the court's decision and indulge every legal\r\npresumption in favor of its judgment.  <em>In re J.I.Z.</em>,  170 S.W.3d 881, 883 (Tex. App.-Corpus\r\nChristi 2005, no pet.).  Based upon our review of the record, including the evidence\r\noutlined above, we find no abuse of discretion. <em>See</em>  <em>Cliff v. Huggins</em>, 724 S.W.2d 778, 779\r\n(Tex. 1987).  Appellant's first and second issues are overruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t2. Limitations Issues</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t In appellant's issues fifteen and nineteen, it complains that the trial court erred in\r\ndenying its motion for directed verdict on the statute of limitations and no evidence of\r\ncontract damages.  In issue twenty, it similarly complains of error because the trial court\r\ndenied its motion for new trial regarding damages on the basis of no evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t  Suit was filed February 23, 1998.  As a general rule, a breach of contract claim\r\naccrues when the contract is breached.  <em>Stine v. Stewart</em>, 80 S.W.3d 586, 592 (Tex. 2002)\r\n(citing  <em>Smith v. Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co.</em>, 101 Tex. 24, 102 S.W. 908, 909 (Tex. 1907)). \r\nAccordingly, under the four-year statute of limitations, no claims or damages before\r\nFebruary 23, 1994 should be allowed.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 16.004 (Vernon\r\n2002).  The jury awarded damages from February 2002, back to and including 1985.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn defense of the limitations issue, appellees pleaded: \"The Plaintiffs did not\r\ndiscovery (sic) the fraud and concealment, by the employees and agents of Southwest\r\ngrain until a short time ago.  The fraudulent concealment by employees and agents of\r\nSouthwest Grain prevented the Plaintiffs from discovery of the important records and\r\ninformation.\"  Appellees argue the limitations statute was tolled by appellant's fraud and\r\nthe doctrine of fraudulent concealment.<sup> (2)</sup>  According to appellees, fraud in and of itself tolls\r\nthe statute, citing <em>S.V. v. R.V. </em>933 S.W.2d 1, 6 (Tex. 1996).  <em>S.V</em>. states that the accrual\r\nof a cause of action is deferred in two types of cases:  (1) in those involving allegations of\r\nfraud or fraudulent concealment, accrual is deferred because a person cannot be permitted\r\nto avoid liability for his actions by deceitfully concealing wrongdoing until limitations has\r\nrun; and (2) in those cases in which the  discovery rule applies, \"the nature of the injury\r\nincurred is inherently undiscoverable and the evidence of injury is objectively verifiable.\" <em>\r\nId.</em>  However, the facts of the <em>S.V</em>. decision are distinguishable because the party R.V. did \r\nnot allege fraud or fraudulent concealment, and could not in that sexual abuse case.  <em>Id.</em>\r\nat 8.  R.V. was not deceived into thinking that she was not being abused when she was. \r\n<em>Id.</em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees next cite <em>Wagner &amp; Brown, Ltd. v. Horwood</em>, 58 S.W.3d 732, 736 (Tex.\r\n2001).  There, the Texas Supreme Court discusses in dicta: \"If Wagner &amp; Brown\r\nfraudulently misrepresented or concealed facts forming the basis of Horwood and Glass's\r\ninjury, which we do not decide, then limitations may, indeed, have been tolled.  But the\r\ndiscovery rule exception and tolling based on fraudulent concealment are distinct concepts\r\nthat exist for different reasons.\"  <em>Id.</em>  \"The fraudulent concealment doctrine, unlike the\r\ndiscovery rule, resembles equitable estoppel.\"  <em>Id.</em>  Appellee also cites <em>Mitchell Energy\r\nCorp. v. Bartlett</em>,  958 S.W.2d 430, 439 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1997, pet. denied)\r\n(fraudulent concealment is based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel; doctrine tolls or\r\nsuspends the running of limitations after it has begun because the defendant concealed\r\nfrom the plaintiff facts necessary for the plaintiff to know that he had a cause of action). \r\n<em>Mitchell Energy </em>also holds that the plaintiff asserting fraudulent concealment must have\r\nreasonably relied on the defendant's lies or improper silence; once a plaintiff knows or\r\nshould know of the deceit, reliance is no longer reasonable, and the tolling effect ends.  <em>Id.</em> \r\n \tAppellees admit they must show:  (1) existence of the underlying \"tort;\" (2) the\r\ndefendant's knowledge of the tort;  (3) the defendant's use of deception to conceal the tort; \r\nand (4) the plaintiff's reasonable reliance on the deception.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Cass v. Stephens</em>, 156\r\nS.W.3d 38, 64 (Tex. App.-El Paso 2004, pet. denied). <em> Cass</em> holds that fraudulent\r\nconcealment applies to any cause of action, including breach of contract claims.  <em>Id.</em> (citing \r\n<em>Hurbrough v. Cain</em>, 571 S.W.2d 216, 221 (Tex. Civ. App.-Tyler 1978, no writ) (op. on\r\nreh'g); <em>Shipp v. O'Dowd</em>, 454 S.W.2d 845, 847 (Tex. Civ. App.-Waco 1970, writ ref'd\r\nn.r.e.)).  Appellees contend the jury's favorable answer to question five of the charge,\r\nbased upon the Texas Pattern Jury charge on equitable estoppel, sustains their burden. \r\nAppellant argues the question should not have been answered.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor context, the questions of the charge asked in substance: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(1)\tDid appellant agree to pay additional rent?  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(2) \tDid appellant fail to comply with the agreement? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(3) \tWas the failure excused by waiver? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(4) \tSpecify the years in which waiver occurred. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(5) \tWas the failure of appellees to exercise any rights under the lease\r\nexcused?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Question three was predicated upon a \"yes\" answer to question two, asking whether\r\nappellant failed to comply with the contract.  It inquired whether appellant's failure to\r\ncomply  was excused as to any of the appellees.  The jury answered \"no\" and accordingly,\r\ndid not answer question four regarding which years appellant was excused from\r\ncompliance.  Question five followed, predicated upon a \"yes\" answer to any part of\r\nquestion four.  There was no \"yes\" answer to question four.  The improperly worded\r\npredicate may explain why the jury answered a question they were instructed not to\r\nanswer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant also argues that because the gratuitous answer to question five was not\r\nnecessarily referable to the statute of limitations, appellees cannot rely thereon in this\r\nappeal, citing <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins of Texas, Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc.</em>, 962 S.W.2d 507,\r\n516  (Tex. 1998).  There, the question was clearly submitted as part of the\r\nDTPA/Insurance Code claim and the jury was instructed not to answer it unless it found\r\nthat J &amp; H had engaged in an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" that was a producing\r\ncause of damages to Kenneco.  <em>Id.</em> The question was not submitted as an independent\r\ncommon-law issue.  <em>Id.</em>  Accordingly,  the wording of the question and its placement after\r\nother questions concerning statutory claims revealed that it was an attempt to submit the\r\n180-day extension issue either under the Insurance Code or the DTPA.  <em>Id.</em>  While there\r\nis merit to appellant's argument, particularly regarding the predicate, question five here\r\nmore closely aligns itself with equitable estoppel than does the analogous question in\r\n<em>Johnson &amp; Higgins.  See id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMore problematic for appellees is the jury's answer to question fourteen.  That\r\nquestion inquired: \"By what date did Abel N. Gonzalez, Jr. or Aida Graciela Gonzalez, or\r\nMartin P. Garza, Jr. become aware that grain sales income was not being used by\r\nSouthwest Grain Co. to calculate rent payments?\"<sup> (3)</sup>  The jury responded as to all three\r\nplaintiffs: \"1985.\"  Appellees counter that question thirteen was answered the year 2000. \r\nThat inquiry asked when did the plaintiffs become aware of the information regarding gross\r\ngrain sales income to calculate the additional rent payments.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees concede they tried to obtain grain sales records at least in 1988 and\r\n1994.  The record suggests that these gross sales records were not produced until 2000\r\nafter a court order.  This was two years after suit was filed.  Because the evidence showed\r\nfraud and fraudulent concealment, appellees argue their failure to exercise rights under the\r\ncontract was excused.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first address appellees' argument that a finding of fraud, standing alone, will\r\ndefer the accrual date of their contract claim.  In fraud or fraudulent concealment cases,\r\naccrual is deferred under a species of equitable estoppel known as fraudulent\r\nconcealment.  <em>Advent Trust Co. v. Hyder</em>, 12 S.W.3d 534, 538 (Tex. App.-San Antonio\r\n1999, pet. denied) (citing <em>Borderlon v. Peck</em>, 661 S.W.2d 907, 908 (Tex.1983)).  A\r\ndefendant is estopped from relying on the statute of limitations until the plaintiff learns of\r\nthe right of action or should have learned of it through the exercise of reasonable diligence. \r\n<em>Advent Trust, </em>12 S.W.3d. at 538 (citing  <em>Computer Assocs.  Int'l, Inc. v. Altai</em>, 918 S.W.2d\r\n453, 456 (Tex. 1996)).  However, in both the case at bar and <em>Advent Trust</em>, when the\r\ncharge is viewed as a whole, the fraud question submitted to the jury involved the\r\nsubstantive tort of fraud, not fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel as avoidances\r\nto the statute of limitations.  <em> Advent Trust,</em>  12 S.W.3d at 542.  Furthermore, appellees'\r\nissue of fraud omits the critical element of the appellees' reasonable reliance or lack of\r\nmeans of obtaining knowledge of the facts.  <em>Id.</em>  The doctrine of equitable estoppel\r\nrequires:  (1) a false representation or concealment of material facts;  (2) made with\r\nknowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts;  (3) with the intention that it should be\r\nacted on;  <em>(4) to a party without knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the facts; </em>\r\n(5) who detrimentally relies on the representations.  <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins</em>, 962 S.W.2d at\r\n516-17 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, we conclude that the fraud question was not\r\nsubmitted as an independent common-law defense to the four-year statute of limitations\r\nand will not support a deferral of accrual of limitations<em>.  See id.</em>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn jury question five, a similar submission problem of the jury charge obtains.  In a\r\nseries of three questions, the jury is first asked in question three whether appellant's failure\r\nto comply with the agreement was excused because of waiver.  The jury responded \"no.\" \r\nQuestion four was predicated upon a \"yes\" answer and instructed the jury to  specify which\r\nyears in which the waiver occurred.  The jury followed the court's instructions and did not\r\nanswer question four.  Question five was predicated again upon a \"yes\" answer to question\r\nfour and should not have been answered under the charge.<sup> (4)</sup>  Again, viewing the charge as\r\na whole, the first five issues deal with the breach of contract claims.  The questions asked\r\nin substance whether appellant agreed to pay additional rent, whether appellant failed to\r\ncomply with the agreement, whether the failure was excused by waiver, in what years did\r\nthe waiver occur, and whether the failure of appellees to exercise any rights under the\r\nlease was excused.  Once again, question five was not submitted as an independent\r\ncommon-law defense to the four year statute of limitations to support a deferral of accrual\r\nof limitations<em>.  See id.</em>  However, even assuming arguendo that question five submitted\r\nequitable estoppel in a substantially correct form, appellees are burdened with the jurors'\r\nanswer to question fourteen.  There, the finders of fact concluded that by 1985, appellees\r\nbecame aware that \"grain sales income was not being used by Southwest Grain Co. to\r\ncalculate rental payments.\"  This was the gravamen of appellees' breach of contract\r\nclaims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe also observe that hundreds of mega-sized Mexican grain trucks traversed\r\nappellees' Rio Grande City property, year after year.  It is difficult to contend that \r\nlandowners could somehow be ignorant of millions of dollars worth of grain being trucked\r\nthrough  their property.  <em>See Barfield v. Howard M. Smith Co. of Amarillo</em>, 426 S.W.2d 834,\r\n840 (Tex. 1968) (a party to arm's-length business transactions had a duty to use ordinary\r\ncare for the protection of its own interests and is charged with knowledge of all facts which\r\nwould have been discovered by a reasonably prudent person similarly situated). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe accrual date of a cause of action is a question of law.  <em>Moreno v. Sterling Drug,\r\nInc., </em>787 S.W.2d 348, 351 (Tex. 1990) (the question of when a cause of action accrues is\r\na judicial one unless defined by the legislature).  A cause of action accrues when a\r\nwrongful act causes some legal injury, even if the fact of injury is not discovered until later,\r\nand even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred.  <em>Murphy v. Campbell</em>, 964 S.W.2d\r\n265, 270 (Tex. 1997) (citing  <em>S.V</em>., 933 S.W.2d at 4).  The legal injury rule can be traced\r\nto  <em>Houston Water-Works Co. v. Kennedy</em>, 70 Tex. 233, 8 S.W. 36, (1888).  The estoppel\r\neffect is not permanent.  Fraudulent concealment merely tolls or suspends the statute of\r\nlimitations until the time the plaintiff learns of the facts that give rise to his cause of action\r\nor should learn of the facts in the exercise of reasonable diligence.  As with any form of\r\nequitable estoppel, a party asserting fraudulent concealment must have relied reasonably\r\non appellant's lies or improper silence.  Once appellees knew or should have known of the\r\ndeceit, reliance is no longer reasonable, and the tolling effect ends.  <em>Arabian Shield\r\nDevelopment Co. v. Hunt</em>, 808 S.W.2d 577, 585  (Tex. App.-Dallas 1991, writ denied). \r\nOnce on notice of the deception, a party must act diligently.  <em>Id.</em>  According to the jury,\r\nappellees knew that grain sales income was not being used to calculate rent payments in\r\n1985.<sup> (5)</sup>  That was also the first year the jury awarded damages.  We conclude the first\r\nbreach of contract cause of action  accrued no later than 1985.  <em>See id.; Murphy </em>964\r\nS.W.2d at 270; <em>see also, Exxon Corp. v. Miesch</em>, 180 S.W.3d. 299, 313-14 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 2005, pet. granted); <em>see also KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison County\r\nHousing Finance Corp., </em>988 S.W.2d 746, 749 (Tex. 1999) (accrual occurs when the\r\nplaintiff knew or should have known of the wrongfully caused injury); <em>Earle v. Ratliff</em>, 998\r\nS.W.2d 882, 888 (Tex. 1999); <em>Stine v. Stewart</em>, 80 S.W.3d at 592.  Therefore, appellees'\r\nclaims before February 23, 1994, are disallowed.  We will reduce appellees' damages\r\naccordingly.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 43.2(b).  We sustain appellant's issues nineteen and\r\ntwenty.  We overrule appellant's issue fifteen. <em> See Guzman v. Ugly Duckling Car Sales of\r\nTexas, L.L.P., </em>63 S.W.3d 522, 528 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2001, pet. denied) (a directed\r\nverdict is improper when the evidence offered on an issue is sufficient to raise an issue of\r\nfact).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t3. Waiver Issues</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's issues three, four, and five urge that the jury's answer to the waiver\r\nissue was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and that the court\r\nerred in refusing to grant a directed verdict on waiver, or erred in refusing to grant a new\r\ntrial in connection with the waiver issue.  Appellant argues that by accepting its own\r\ncalculation of the additional rent due on sales from the Rio Grande City facility year after\r\nyear, appellees waived the right to collect any further additional rent based upon grain\r\nsales.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWaiver is defined as \"an intentional relinquishment of a known right or intentional\r\nconduct inconsistent with claiming that right.\"  <em>Jernigan v. Langley</em>, 111 S.W.3d 153, 157\r\n(Tex. 2003) (citing <em>Sun Exploration &amp; Prod.  Co. v. Benton</em>, 728 S.W.2d 35, 37 (Tex.1987); \r\n<em>U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Bimco Iron &amp; Metal Corp.</em>, 464 S.W.2d 353, 357 (Tex.1971)). \r\nWaiver is largely a matter of intent.  For implied waiver to be found through a party's\r\nactions, intent must be clearly demonstrated by the surrounding facts and circumstances<em>. \r\nMotor Vehicle Bd. v. El Paso Indep. Auto. Dealers Ass'n, Inc.</em>, 1 S.W.3d 108, 111 (Tex.\r\n1999).  There is no waiver of a right if the person sought to be charged with waiver says\r\nor does nothing inconsistent with an intent to rely upon such right.  <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v.\r\nPalestine Fashions, Inc., </em>402 S.W.2d 883, 888 (Tex. 1966).  Waiver is ordinarily a question\r\nof fact, but when the facts and circumstances are undisputed, the question becomes one\r\nof law.  <em>Motor Vehicle Bd.</em>, 1 S.W.3d at 111.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that appellees claimed that appellant paid insufficient additional\r\nrent after the execution of the first leases in 1981.  Appellant calculated and paid additional\r\nrent to appellees for many years.  Appellees accepted and cashed all rent checks. \r\nAccording to appellant, appellees were furnished summary sheets and backup records\r\ndetailing the additional rent calculations.  Appellees hired certified public accountants and\r\na law firm to audit the material records beginning in 1987.  Appellant also hired a CPA in\r\n1997 to provide another explanation of the rent calculations.  Despite knowing how the rent\r\nwas being calculated, appellees accepted and cashed all rent checks prior to the lawsuit,\r\naccording to appellant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees counter that appellant did not prove that appellees intended to waive their\r\nrights to additional rents, citing <em>Enserch Corp. v. Rebich</em>, 925 S.W.2d 75, 82 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Tyler 1996, writ dism'd).  We agree.  The key element in establishing waiver is the\r\nintent of the alleged waiving party.  <em>Id.</em>  The very factors argued by appellant, that appellees\r\ncontinued to ask for records and complained the additional rents were not being properly\r\ncalculated, demonstrate a lack of intent to waive their rights under the contracts.  Appellees\r\nalso made some notations on checks and correspondence expressing their concern that\r\nappellant was not complying with the contract.  Further, as argued by appellee, \"waiver by\r\nimplication should not be inferred contrary to the intention of the party whose rights would\r\nbe injuriously affected thereby, unless the opposite party has been misled to his or her\r\nprejudice.\" <em> Id.</em> (citing <em>Cecil Pond Const. Co. v. Ed Bell Investments, Inc</em>., 864 S.W.2d 211,\r\n215 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1993, no writ).  Appellant neither alleges nor points us to any\r\nevidence that it was somehow prejudiced or misled by paying less than the agreed upon\r\nadditional rents for many years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe various annual leases also contained an express non-waiver clause.  Appellees\r\nargue such clauses are valid and enforceable.  We agree.  Although non-waiver clauses\r\nmay themselves be waived, they are generally considered valid and enforceable.  <em>A.G.E.,\r\nInc. v. Buford</em>, 105 S.W.3d 667, 676 (Tex. App.-Austin 2003, pet. denied).  Appellant\r\npoints to no evidence in the record that appellees expressly or impliedly waived this clause\r\nof the contract.  We would also note that each contract had a period of one year.  The non-waiver clause was thus renewed year after year.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, the law also indicates that when a person accepting benefits does not have\r\nknowledge of all material facts, ratification or estoppel cannot ensue from acceptance of\r\nthe benefits.  <em>Herschbach v. City of Corpus Christi</em>, 883 S.W.2d 720, 737 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 1994, writ denied) (citing <em>Frazier v. Wynn</em>, 472 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex.\r\n1971)).  The record is also devoid of evidence that appellant was prejudiced by appellees'\r\nacceptance of lesser monies for additional rent.  Therefore, the affirmative defense of\r\nwaiver by implication is not available to appellant.  <em>Enserch Corp</em>.  925 S.W.2d at 82. \r\nThus, we cannot conclude, as appellant advocates, that the verdict is so against the great\r\nweight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust<em>.  See Pool v. Ford\r\nMotor Co.</em>, 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986).  Similarily, a directed verdict is improper\r\nwhen the evidence offered on an issue is sufficient to raise an issue of fact.  <em>See Guzman,\r\n</em>63 S.W.3d at 528.  And, there being sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings of no\r\nwaiver, the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for new trial on this issue.  <em>Oyster\r\nCreek Financial Corp. v. Richwood Investments II, Inc.</em>, 176 S.W.3d 307, 324 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied) (standard of review of the denial of a motion\r\nfor new trial is abuse of discretion).  We overrule appellant's issues three, four, and five.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t   \t4. Ambiguity</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, appellant argues the additional rent\r\nprovision of the lease contracts is ambiguous.  It claims the lease contracts are reasonably\r\nsusceptible to more than one meaning.  The challenged provision states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t5.  Additional Rent.  LESSEE further agrees to pay LESSORS without prior\r\nnotice or demand at their address listed on the last page hereof, or such\r\nother place as LESSORS may designate in writing, as additional rent for the\r\nleased premises, a sum equal to the amount by which One and 66/100\r\n(1.66%) percent of LESSEE'S gross sales in any lease year exceeds\r\nLESSEE'S annual rental for such year.  In this connection, the terms \"lease\r\nyear\", \"annual rental\", \"gross rental\" and \"sales premises shall mean as\r\nfollows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tC.  \"Gross Sales\": The total amount of the dollar value of all sales of\r\ngoods, services or combination thereof, and all revenue of every kind\r\nand character derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of\r\na business or business activities conducted on the sales premises .\r\n. . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tD.  \"Sales Premises\": The real property presently leased by LESSEE\r\nfrom the Rio Grande City Consolidated Independent School District\r\nand served by the easement herein granted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t6.  <span>Records</span>.  LESSEE shall maintain (according to good accounting\r\npractices) full and accurate books and records with respect to the gross\r\nsales made at or from the sales premises . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to appellant, the disputed language relates to the definition of \"gross\r\nsales.\"  Appellant argues that the language \"derived from and, arising out of, or payable\r\non account of a business or business activities conducted on the sales premises\" pertains\r\nonly to specific activities conducted on the leased premises.  Appellant claims that\r\nappellees' interpretation relates to other activities off premises \"if those activities are even\r\nremotely connected to the other . . . .\"  Appellant concludes by arguing that a written\r\ninstrument is ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or it is reasonably\r\nsusceptible to more than one meaning, taking into consideration the circumstances present\r\nwhen the instrument was executed.  Appellant cites and quotes from<em> Towers of Texas, Inc.\r\nv. J &amp; J Sys., Inc</em>., 834 S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex. 1992).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees counter that the language is not ambiguous and to the contrary, is clear. \r\nThe leases required appellant to pay additional rent as a percentage of the company's\r\n\"gross sales.\"  Gross sales are broadly and clearly defined as, \"[t]he total amount of the\r\ndollar value of all sales of goods, services or combination thereof, and all revenue of every\r\nkind and character derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of a business or\r\nbusiness activities conducted on the sales premises . . . .\"  Appellees also point out that\r\ncounsel for appellant argued in his motion for directed verdict: \"In connection with the\r\ntheory of recovery related to contract and breach of contract, the intent of the parties is\r\nclear.\"  However, in context, counsel went on to say that to the extent the contract may be\r\nambiguous, the evidence showed the clear intent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees further argue that appellant cannot create an ambiguity by combing the\r\n\"records\" provision of the lease.  The \"records\" provision simply mandates books be kept\r\nregarding gross sales \"at and from\" the sales premises.  This phrasing is not inconsistent\r\nwith the gross sales provision \"derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of a\r\nbusiness or business activities conducted on the sales premises . . . .\"  In our view, the\r\nrecords-keeping provision is a lesser included, more narrow provision, which is itself\r\nincluded in the broader definition of \"gross sales.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA contract is not ambagious if it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning.\r\n<em>Lopez v. Munoz, Hockema &amp; Reed, L.L.P.</em>, 22 S.W.3d 857, 861 (Tex. 2000).  Whether a\r\ncontract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide.  <em>Id.</em>  In construing\r\ncontracts, we ascertain and give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the\r\ndocument.  <em>Id.</em>  Ambiguity does not arise simply because the parties advance conflicting\r\ninterpretations of the contract;  rather, for an ambiguity to exist, both interpretations must\r\nbe reasonable.  <em>Id.</em>  We agree that the contract language is unambiguous because it can\r\nbe given a definite legal meaning, and it is not reasonably susceptible to more than one\r\nmeaning.  <em>Id.</em>  Appellant's issue six is overruled.  Because appellant's issues seven, eight,\r\nnine, and ten are predicated upon the assumption that the contract was ambiguous, they\r\nare also overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t5. The Court's Charge</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant attacks the trial court's rulings on the charge in issues eleven, twelve,\r\nthirteen, and fourteen.  In issue eleven, appellant claims the trial court would not allow\r\nappellant to \"object to the charge.\"  More appropriately, appellant's actual complaint at the\r\ncharge conference was that the trial judge did rule on appellant's objections and refused\r\nissues, but did not allow appellant to reiterate its objections.  Appellant attempted to repeat\r\nthe same identical objection over and over again to each of his requested and refused\r\nissues.  The trial court marked each request refused, signed the refusal, and overruled\r\nappellant's objection to the refusal.  The standard of review for error in a jury charge is\r\nabuse of discretion.  <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24 S.W.3d 338, 341 (Tex.2000).  Contrary to appellant's\r\nassertion, the trial court did rule upon appellant's objections.  Thus, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em>  We overrule this issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its issue number twelve, appellant argues the trial court erred in refusing its issue\r\non anticipatory repudiation of the contract.  When appellees filed suit on February 23,\r\n1998, they also requested and obtained a temporary restraining order against appellant. \r\nAccording to appellant, this effectively deprived appellant of the use of the property and\r\nthus appellant repudiated the contract.  The restraining order was stayed four days later\r\nby this Court.  No permanent injunction ensued.  After four days, parties did business as\r\nusual.  Appellant cites <em>Group Life and Health Ins. Co. v. Turner</em>, 620 S.W.2d 670, 672-73\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.-Dallas 1981, no writ) (repudiation is conduct which shows a fixed intention\r\nto abandon, renounce, and refuse to perform the contract, without just excuse).  The\r\nprimary thrust of the restraining order was to prohibit the spoliation of evidence by\r\nappellant.  Appellant points to no evidence in the record that appellees had a fixed intent\r\nto renounce and refuse to perform the contract.<sup> (6)</sup>  In fact, appellees' original petition,\r\ncontaining the request for the restraining order, was to enforce the contract, not renounce\r\nit.  We find no abuse of discretion by the court's refusal of appellant's repudiation issue. \r\n<em>See</em> <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24 S.W.3d at 341.  We overrule this issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its thirteenth issue, appellant complains of error by the trial court in refusing a jury\r\nissue asking in which years the contract was breached.  This question was already\r\nincluded in two places, that is, in damage questions fifteen and sixteen.  These questions \r\ninquired on a year-by-year basis what damages were proximately caused by appellant's\r\nconduct.  Furthermore, as appellees suggest, there was no dispute that appellant did not\r\npay the claimed additional rent in each of the years that damages were found by the jury. \r\nAppellant argued in trial, as it does on appeal, that it had properly calculated additional rent\r\nbased only on the transfer charges.  Appellant also contended that it did not owe anything\r\non McCook sales and that those sales, even if the grain went through Rio Grande City,\r\nwere not sales of goods, or revenue arising out of, or payable on account of a business or\r\nbusiness activities conducted in Rio Grande City.  Stated otherwise, appellant's defense\r\nwas consistent for each year and it did not argue or present evidence that appellees'\r\nclaims or its defenses were somehow different in different years.<sup> (7)</sup>  Therefore, the trial court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion by refusing the requested issue both because the issue was\r\nnot raised and, in any event, was covered by questions 15 and 16.  <em>See</em> <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24\r\nS.W.3d at 341; <em>Bedford v. Moore</em>, 166 S.W.3d 454, 458 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2005, no\r\npet.) (to have a question submitted to the jury, there must be a proper legal theory, and\r\nthere must be sufficient evidence adduced to warrant its submission).  We overrule this\r\nissue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t6. Appellant's Attorney's Fees</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNext appellant complains it was entitled to an issue on attorney's fees.  Appellant\r\ncites no authority that would allow its recovery of attorney's fees when unsuccessfully\r\ndefending a breach of contract case.  This issue was properly rejected by the trial court. \r\nAppellant did not prevail and even a successful defense of a contract claim does not allow\r\nattorney's fees unless provided by contract.  <em>Horizontal Holes, Inc. v. River Valley\r\nEnterprises, Inc.</em>, 197 S.W.3d 834, 835-36 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2006, no pet.).  The civil\r\npractices and remedies code allows a party to recover such fees if the party prevails on a\r\ncause of action for which attorney's fees are recoverable and recovers damages.  Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 1997); <em>Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis</em>, 951 S.W.2d\r\n384, 390 (Tex. 1997).  However, a party who does not recover for breach of contract\r\ncannot recover attorney's fees under that theory.  <em>Horizontal Holes, Inc</em>. 197 S.W.3d at\r\n835-36.  Appellant's fourteenth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t7. Credits</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues sixteen and nineteen, appellant contends that the jury did not properly\r\ncredit it for additional rent payments actually made by appellant.  While the jury properly\r\ndeducted base rent paid from the damages found, it did not deduct additional rent\r\npayments made by appellant.  Appellees argue waiver of the issue which we addressed\r\nabove.  Thereafter, appellees inform us that \"it appears that the jury failed to give credit for\r\nadditional rent actually paid.\"  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs we discussed in the limitations issue supra, no claims or damages before\r\nFebruary 23, 1994, should be allowed and therefore, no credits before that date are\r\nallowed.  The amounts of additional rents already paid are found on appellant's exhibit\r\nseven.  Credits should have been deducted from the damages awarded to Abel N.\r\nGonzalez, Jr. and Aida Graciela Gonzalez in the amount of $19,405.03, and a similar credit\r\nshould have been deducted from the damages awarded to Martin Garza in like amount. \r\nWe sustain issue nineteen, and modify the judgment accordingly. <em> See</em> Tex. R. App. P.\r\n43.2(b).<sup> (8)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t8. Appellees' Attorney's Fees</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its issues seventeen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, and twenty-four, appellant argues: (1) no attorney's fees should be awarded; (2) improper award of\r\nattorney's fees; (3) a contingent fee was improper; (4) the amount awarded was too large;\r\nand (5) alternatively, appellees' award of attorney's fees should be adjusted.  Appellant\r\nbegins its argument by insisting that the attorney's fees must be segregated between the\r\nfraud and contract claims, as well as the defense of the counter-claim.  It cites <em>Crow v.\r\nCentral Soya Co., Inc</em>., 651 S.W.2d 392, 396 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1983, ref. n.r.e.) (fees\r\nattributable to the defense of a counterclaim are not recoverable unless the facts\r\nnecessary for the plaintiff to recover also serve to defeat the counterclaim).  We agree. \r\nAppellant also cites <em>Bray v. Curtis</em>, 544 S.W.2d 816, 820 (Tex. Civ. App.-Corpus Christi\r\n1976, ref. n.r.e.) (unless attorney's fees are provided by statute, or by a contract between\r\nthe parties, such fees are not recoverable).  Again, we agree.  Finally, appellant cites\r\n<em>Panizo v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n of Greater Houston Area</em>, 938 S.W.2d 163,170\r\n(Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).  <em>Panizo</em> holds that a party seeking attorney's\r\nfees usually has a duty to segregate nonrecoverable fees from recoverable fees and to\r\nsegregate the fees owed by different parties.  <em>Id.</em>  However, it also reiterates the historical\r\nexception to the duty to segregate when the attorney's fees rendered are in connection with\r\nclaims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or\r\ndefense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts. <em>Id.</em> (citing <em>Stewart Title Guar.\r\nCo. v. Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex.1991)). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tThe supreme court has recently reaffirmed the rule that if any attorney's fees relate\r\nsolely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate\r\nrecoverable from unrecoverable fees.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>,  212 S.W.3d\r\n299, 313 (Tex. 2006).  Intertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable per se; it is only\r\nwhen discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they\r\nare so intertwined that they need not be segregated.  <em>Id.</em>  The court modified <em>Sterling</em> to\r\nthat extent.  <em>Id.</em> at 314. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhether fees can be segregated between various claims historically has been a\r\nquestion for the court.  <em>Cotten v. Weatherford Bancshares, Inc</em>., 187 S.W.3d 687, 709 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied).  Again, <em>Tony Gullo Motors </em>somewhat modifies that\r\nrule indicating that sometimes the matters in issue are more a mixed question of law and\r\nfact for the jury.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors,</em> 212 S.W.3d at 313.  Here, the duties of the parties\r\narose out of a single contract that was renewed year after year.  The same facts necessary\r\nfor appellees to establish their breach of contract claims would also inure to the defense\r\nof appellant's counter-claim, both in pre-trial discovery, and during the trial itself.  Whether\r\nor not appellant fraudulently concealed vital information concerning the additional rents or\r\ncommitted fraud was also intertwined with both the assertions and defenses of all the\r\nparties regarding recovery under the contract.  Discovery, voir dire, examination of the\r\nwitnesses, and most every aspect of the trial required the same attorney services in order\r\nto prove or disprove these contentions.  <em>See id.</em>  We conclude that the discrete legal\r\nservices advanced both recoverable and unrecoverable claims that were so intertwined\r\nthat they need not be segregated.  <em>Id.</em>  These issues are overruled.<sup> (9)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith regard to appellant's issue contesting the contingent fee award, appellant cites\r\n<em>Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. v. Perry Equipment Corp</em>., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997)\r\n(party's contingent fee agreement should be considered by the fact finder, and is\r\nadmissible in evidence, but the agreement alone cannot support an award of attorney's\r\nfees under Texas Business and Commerce Code section 17.50(d)).  Similarly, appellant\r\ncites <em>Lubbock County v. Strube, </em>953 S.W.2d 847, 858 (Tex. App.-Austin 1997, no writ)\r\n(finding there was insufficient evidence for the jury to determine whether the amount was\r\nreasonable and necessary; therefore reversing award of attorney's fees).  The record here\r\ndecidedly departs from the appellant's authorities.  First, we are not dealing with either a\r\nDTPA claim or a jury submission requesting a percentage answer.  <em>See Arthur Andersen\r\n&amp; Co. </em> 945 S.W.2d at 818-19.  Second, appellees duly supported their claim for attorney's\r\nfees through the testimony of both of appellees' trial counsel.  <em>Cf. Lubbock County</em>, 953\r\nS.W.2d at 858 (finding insufficient evidence where jury was asked to award attorney's fees\r\nas a percentage of damages).  Counsel for appellant also testified about the\r\nreasonableness and necessity of his attorney's fees.  Appellees' counsel's testimony\r\ncovered, in varying degrees, the eight factors found in the rules of professional conduct. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof'l Conduct 1.04; <em>see also Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. </em> 945\r\nS.W.2d at 818-19.  This issue is overruled as to the argument that any contingent award\r\nwas improper.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant next argues the fees are excessive, citing <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. v. ABC Steel\r\nProducts Co., Inc.</em>, 582 S.W.2d 883, 889 (Tex. Civ. App.-Texarkana 1979, writ ref'd, n.r.e.)\r\n(in determining whether the award is excessive, the reviewing court is entitled to look at the\r\nentire record and to view the matter in the light of the testimony, the amount in controversy,\r\nthe nature of the case, and our own common knowledge and experience as lawyers and\r\njudges).  Over 1000 hours were spent on this matter by appellees' two trial counsel.  Given\r\nthe difficulty and novelty of the questions involved, the time, the preclusion of other\r\nemployment, the usual and customary fees charged, the amounts involved, the result, the\r\nnature and length of the professional relationships with the clients, the experience,\r\nreputation, and ability of the lawyers performing the services, and the fact that the\r\nattorney's fees contract was contingent, based upon the jury's verdict we would not\r\nconclude the attorney's fees were excessive.  <em>See</em> <em>Id.</em>; Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof'l\r\nConduct 1.04.  However, the fact that we have substantially reduced the damage award,\r\nwhich dated back to 1985, also works to change one of the most significant factors to be\r\nconsidered by the fact finder, i.e., the results obtained.  <em>Id.</em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, appellant also contends that, even if appellees were properly awarded\r\nattorney's fees based upon a contingent fee contract, the jury's award should be adjusted\r\nto reflect a percentage of the actual damages recoverable.  The jury's attorney's fees\r\nquestion asked for a total dollar amount to be awarded appellees.  Both sides agree that\r\nthe award was based upon a contingent fee.  The percentages awarded were supported\r\nby the testimony of Mr. Ramirez for an amount of 36% through trial, 40% if appealed to the\r\ncourt of appeals, and 45% if reviewed by the Texas Supreme Court.  According to the\r\nrecord, these calculations were clearly based upon the recovery of additional rents dating\r\nback to 1985.  We have disallowed any recovery on claims for damages before February\r\n23, 1994.  Therefore, we must likewise disallow any attorney's fees for any recovery before\r\nFebruary 23, 1994.  <em>See Argonaut Ins. Co.</em>, 582 S.W.2d at 889.  While in this case, it would\r\nseem that a remittitur is easily discernable, as we read the Texas Supreme Court's latest\r\npronouncement, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the jury as to how much\r\nweight to give the \"results obtained\" factor and how to balance that factor in conjunction\r\nwith the evidence of each of the other factors the jury was instructed to consider in\r\nawarding attorney's fees.  <em>Barker v. Eckman</em>, 2006 Tex. LEXIS 1187, at *18-20, 50 Tex.\r\nSup. Ct. J. 175 (Tex. Dec. 1, 2006).  Nor may we apparently use a \"presumptive\r\nproportionality\" to effectuate a remittitur of attorneys fees.<sup> (10)</sup>  <em>Id.</em> at *19-*20 (citing <em>Tatum v.\r\nPreston Carter Co.</em>, 702 S.W.2d 186, 188 (Tex. 1986)) (holding that court of appeals erred\r\nin proportionally reducing exemplary damages in the exact ratio as the actual damages\r\nwere reduced).  We conclude that for us to simply reduce or remit excessive attorney's\r\nfees according to the percentages found by the jury is problematic.  We are authorized to\r\nreverse and remand only the award of attorneys' fees.  <em>ASAI Corp. v. Vanco Insulation\r\nAbatement, Inc</em>., 932 S.W.2d 118, 124 (Tex. App.-El Paso 1996, no writ).  We so hold. \r\nAppellant's issue seventeen is sustained.  Appellant's other issues concerning appellees'\r\nattorney's fees are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t9. New Trial Granted</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its final issue, appellant contends the trial court erred by granting a new trial in\r\nJanuary 2003 allegedly based on jury misconduct.  In any event, the new trial was granted\r\n\"in the interests of justice.\"  Appellees cite <em>Wilkins v. Methodist Health Care System</em>, 160\r\nS.W.3d 559, 563 (Tex. 2005).  <em>Wilkins</em> holds that, except in very limited circumstances, an\r\norder granting a motion for new trial rendered within the period of the trial court's plenary\r\npower is not reviewable on appeal, citing  <em>Cummins v. Paisan Constr. Co.</em>, 682 S.W.2d\r\n235, 236 (Tex.1984).  <em>See also </em> <em>Johnson v. Fourth Court of Appeals</em>, 700 S.W.2d 916, 918\r\n(Tex. 1985) (noting two instances when a Texas appellate court has overturned the trial\r\ncourt's grant of a new trial:  when the trial court's order was wholly void, and where the trial\r\ncourt specified in a written order that the sole ground for granting the motion was that the\r\njury's answers to special issues were irreconcilably conflicting).  When a motion for new\r\ntrial is granted, \"the case shall be reinstated upon the docket of the trial court and stand\r\nfor trial the same as though no trial had been had.\"  <em>Wilkins</em> 160 S.W.3d. at 563.

The remainder of the judgment is modified, and affirmed as modified, by\r\nreducing each set of appellees' damages by $1,210,919.52.  The remaining damages are\r\nfurther each reduced by a credit of $19,405.03.  The judgment in favor of appellee Martin\r\nP. Garza is therefore affirmed in the amount of $1,632,898.18.

Retired Fourteenth Court of Appeals Justice Don Wittig assigned to this Court by Chief Justice of the \r\nSupreme Court of Texas pursuant to the government code.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.003 (Vernon 2005).\r\n</p><p>2.  Appellants do not contend that the discovery rule applies.\r\n</p><p>3.   At oral argument, appellees argued that there was no dispute about the base rent and that, of\r\ncourse, appellees knew that grain sales were not being used to calculate the base rent.  This argument was\r\nnot raised by objection at the charge conference or in appellees' brief and is therefore waived.  In any event,\r\nin context of the charge as a whole, the only time rent was to be based on grain sales was in the application\r\nof the 1.66% of gross sales as additional rent.   According to the record, the two primary sources of gross\r\nsales were, first and foremost, grain sales, and to a much lesser degree, transfer charges generated by the\r\nRio Grande City facility. The voluminous records introduced by appellees were grain sales, which were the\r\nsine qua non of appellees' claims.  Without the grain sales in question, no additional rent was due, other than\r\nthat due for transfer fees already paid by appellant.  Appellant contended throughout that it only owed the\r\ntransfer fees.  Appellees contended throughout that additional rent was also due on the grain sales.\r\n</p><p>4.   As indicated above, the predicate to question five was incorrectly worded.  A more appropriate\r\nwording would have been:  \"If you answered by specifying any year or years to any part of question 4, then\r\nanswer yes or no as to each of the corresponding individuals.  Otherwise do not answer this question.\"\r\n</p><p>5.   Appellant could well have been guilty of fraud or fraudulent concealment before 1985.  But, by that\r\ndate, appellees were charged with knowledge that appellants were not paying additional rents based upon\r\ngrain sales.   Appellant's consistent approach, well known to appellees, was to base additional rent solely upon\r\ntransfer fees at the Rio Grande facility.\r\n</p><p>6.  Pleadings are ordinarily not evidence.  <em>See Laidlaw Waste Sys. (Dallas), Inc. v. City of Wilmer</em>, 904\r\nS.W.2d 656, 660 (Tex. 1995).\r\n</p><p>7.   The primary variation of the evidence between the years was the amount of sales and damages,\r\nnot that different types of breaches occurred or that appellant's defense varied.\r\n</p><p>8.   Issue sixteen is accordingly moot.\r\n</p><p>9.   Appellant's first two arguments are overlapping and are overruled.  In any event, upon remand, the\r\ntrial court and/or jury will be required to follow the new precedent set in <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, \r\n212 S.W.3d 299, 310 - 314(Tex. 2006). \r\n</p><p>10.  It is not at all clear that a presumptive proportionality could not be used where the parties agree the\r\nattorney's fees award were largely based upon a fixed contingent fee contract and  where, as here, the\r\npercentages found by the jury are clear.  Nor should <em>Tatum</em> apply when the record demonstrates the patent\r\ncontractual basis for the jury's findings.  <em>Cf. Tatum v. Preston Carter Co.</em>, 702 S.W.2d 186, 188 (Tex. 1986).\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

In twenty-five issues, appellant raises points of error concerning the legal and\r\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence, the four-year statute of limitations, waiver, ambiguity\r\nof the contract language, charge error, lack of credit for additional rent paid, the award of\r\nattorney's fees, and error by the trial court in granting a new trial after an earlier jury verdict\r\nin favor of appellant.  As modified, we will affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part\r\non the issue of attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury found damages on behalf of plaintiffs below, appellees, Martin P. Garza,\r\nJr., Abel N. Gonzalez, Jr., and Aida Graciela Gonzalez.  Although appellees pleaded and\r\nsecured findings of fraud and breach of contract, they elected to recover on their contract\r\nclaims.  The contract claims were based upon a series of ground leases for an easement. \r\nThe leases provided for a base rental plus 1.66% \"additional rent.\"  The jury found a\r\nbreach of the lease and awarded damages on an annual basis dating back to 1985.  The\r\ndamages were awarded per annum for sixteen years through 2001, plus the first two\r\nmonths of 2002.  They totaled $2,863,222.63 each for the two groups of appellees. \r\nAttorney's fees were also awarded in the amount of $2,061,520.30 through trial, plus\r\nadditional amounts in the event of appeals.  One juror did not sign the verdict form.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t1. Breach of Contract</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first issue, appellant asserts the trial court erred by overruling its motion for\r\ndirected verdict regarding breach of contract.  In its second issue, appellant charges error\r\nbecause the trial court denied its motion for new trial on the breach of contract issues.  In\r\nissue fifteen, appellant contends there was error because the trial court refused a directed\r\nverdict on the statute of limitations.  In issue twenty, appellant contends the trial court erred\r\nin denying its motion for new trial on the basis that there was no evidence of contractual\r\ndamages.  Appellant argues these matters together and we will likewise address these\r\nmatters together, first as to breach of contract, and then as to the statute of limitations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees contend these and other issues were waived because appellant failed to\r\ncomply with Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(h) concerning the requisites for briefs. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Appellant, in its reply brief, seeks to satisfy this requirement\r\nby providing additional authority addressing appellees' complaints.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have been instructed  that appellate courts should not dismiss an appeal for a\r\nprocedural defect whenever any arguable interpretation of the Rules of Appellate\r\nProcedure would preserve the appeal.  <em>Verburgt v.

Thus, we\r\nshould reasonably and liberally construe the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure so that\r\nthe right to appeal is not lost by imposing requirements not absolutely necessary to effect\r\nthe purpose of a rule.  <em>Id.</em>;  <em>cf.

Instead, it claims that sales of grain were conducted at its facility\r\nin McCook, Texas.  The sales of grain at McCook were not \"derived from, arising out of,\r\nor payable on account of\" grain transfer activities that admittedly occurred at Rio Grande\r\nCity.  Several of appellant's witnesses testified to this effect.  Further, the numerous grain\r\nsales invoices introduced into evidence had the letter \"M\" on them indicating, according to\r\nappellant, that the sales originated at McCook and not Rio Grande City.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees counter that the lease language defined \"gross sales\" as the \"dollar value\r\nof all sales of goods, services, or combination thereof, and all revenue of every kind and\r\ncharacter derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of a business or business\r\nactivities conducted on the sales premises. . . .\"  Appellees' witnesses, Garza and\r\nGonzalez, testified that the grain invoices reflected appellant's sales.  These numerous\r\ndocuments were summarized.  One derivative exhibit, admitted by agreement, reflected\r\nthe gross sales of all business activity that went through the Rio Grande City facility.  The\r\nevidence also indicated that Rio Grande City was pivotal to appellant's very successful\r\ngrain sales to Mexican markets.  The Rio Grande City facility allowed oversized Mexican\r\ntrucks to load grain in the United States then traverse the border without the necessity of\r\ntraveling on state highways where the use of these larger trucks was prohibited.  A former\r\nexecutive vice president for appellant, Norma Myers, testified that Rio Grande City\r\ngenerated the sales documents and conducted related activities supporting the grain sales\r\nat the site.  She stated the Rio Grande City facility was appellant's selling point for grain\r\nto Mexico.  Before appellant had the facility, it did not sell grain to Mexico.  Once the Rio\r\nGrande City facility opened, appellant became one of the biggest grain sellers to Mexico. \r\nOne of appellant's directors spent seventy to eighty per cent of his time at the facility and\r\nmet, often daily, with Mexican grain customers at the Rio Grande City facility.  Myers\r\ntestified that most of the sales were made out of this facility, not McCook.  Appellant's\r\nsales representative for Mexico also worked out of the facility.  The invoices indicated the\r\nbusiness activity originated from Rio Grande City, and not McCook or Brownsville.  In sum,\r\nthe record reflects that many of the material operative facts were hotly contested by the\r\nparties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMyers further testified she was instructed to only show appellees the scale tickets\r\nand not the actual sales invoices.  In an affidavit submitted in a preliminary matter in the\r\ncase, appellant's general manager swore the company would lose $70,000 per day if the\r\nRio Grande City facility were shut down.  At trial, the manager qualified the prior affidavit\r\nlanguage to say the company was not making that much money per day, and that the\r\nfigure included \"people breaking contracts and our suppliers' trucks being parked outside\r\nand we couldn't get them in.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant criticizes the testimony of Myers because she left the company in March\r\nof 1996.  According to some of appellant's witnesses, she was a disgruntled employee and\r\nleft on bad terms.  This too was disputed.  Myers was also to receive three percent of any\r\nrecovery for additional rent payments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA court may instruct a verdict if no evidence of probative force raises a fact issue\r\non the material questions in the suit.<em>  Prudential Ins.

Appellees contend the jury's favorable answer to question five of the charge,\r\nbased upon the Texas Pattern Jury charge on equitable estoppel, sustains their burden. \r\nAppellant argues the question should not have been answered.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor context, the questions of the charge asked in substance: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(1)\tDid appellant agree to pay additional rent?  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(2) \tDid appellant fail to comply with the agreement? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(3) \tWas the failure excused by waiver? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(4) \tSpecify the years in which waiver occurred. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(5) \tWas the failure of appellees to exercise any rights under the lease\r\nexcused?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Question three was predicated upon a \"yes\" answer to question two, asking whether\r\nappellant failed to comply with the contract.  It inquired whether appellant's failure to\r\ncomply  was excused as to any of the appellees.  The jury answered \"no\" and accordingly,\r\ndid not answer question four regarding which years appellant was excused from\r\ncompliance.  Question five followed, predicated upon a \"yes\" answer to any part of\r\nquestion four.  There was no \"yes\" answer to question four.  The improperly worded\r\npredicate may explain why the jury answered a question they were instructed not to\r\nanswer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant also argues that because the gratuitous answer to question five was not\r\nnecessarily referable to the statute of limitations, appellees cannot rely thereon in this\r\nappeal, citing <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins of Texas, Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1774526\"><a href=\"/opinion/1774526/johnson-higgins-of-tx-inc-v-kenneco-energy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>,\r\n516  (Tex. 1998).  There, the question was clearly submitted as part of the\r\nDTPA/Insurance Code claim and the jury was instructed not to answer it unless it found\r\nthat J &amp; H had engaged in an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" that was a producing\r\ncause of damages to Kenneco.  <em>Id.</em> The question was not submitted as an independent\r\ncommon-law issue.  <em>Id.</em>  Accordingly,  the wording of the question and its placement after\r\nother questions concerning statutory claims revealed that it was an attempt to submit the\r\n180-day extension issue either under the Insurance Code or the DTPA.  <em>Id.</em>  While there\r\nis merit to appellant's argument, particularly regarding the predicate, question five here\r\nmore closely aligns itself with equitable estoppel than does the analogous question in\r\n<em>Johnson &amp; Higgins.  See id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMore problematic for appellees is the jury's answer to question fourteen.  That\r\nquestion inquired: \"By what date did Abel N. Gonzalez, Jr. or Aida Graciela Gonzalez, or\r\nMartin P. Garza, Jr. become aware that grain sales income was not being used by\r\nSouthwest Grain Co. to calculate rent payments?\"<sup> (3)</sup>  The jury responded as to all three\r\nplaintiffs: \"1985.\"  Appellees counter that question thirteen was answered the year 2000. \r\nThat inquiry asked when did the plaintiffs become aware of the information regarding gross\r\ngrain sales income to calculate the additional rent payments.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees concede they tried to obtain grain sales records at least in 1988 and\r\n1994.  The record suggests that these gross sales records were not produced until 2000\r\nafter a court order.  This was two years after suit was filed.  Because the evidence showed\r\nfraud and fraudulent concealment, appellees argue their failure to exercise rights under the\r\ncontract was excused.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first address appellees' argument that a finding of fraud, standing alone, will\r\ndefer the accrual date of their contract claim.  In fraud or fraudulent concealment cases,\r\naccrual is deferred under a species of equitable estoppel known as fraudulent\r\nconcealment.  <em>Advent Trust Co. v.

A\r\ndefendant is estopped from relying on the statute of limitations until the plaintiff learns of\r\nthe right of action or should have learned of it through the exercise of reasonable diligence. \r\n<em>Advent Trust, </em>12 S.W.3d. at 538 (citing  <em>Computer Assocs.

However, in both the case at bar and <em>Advent Trust</em>, when the\r\ncharge is viewed as a whole, the fraud question submitted to the jury involved the\r\nsubstantive tort of fraud, not fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel as avoidances\r\nto the statute of limitations.  <em> Advent Trust,</em>  12 S.W.3d at 542.  Furthermore, appellees'\r\nissue of fraud omits the critical element of the appellees' reasonable reliance or lack of\r\nmeans of obtaining knowledge of the facts.  <em>Id.</em>  The doctrine of equitable estoppel\r\nrequires:  (1) a false representation or concealment of material facts;  (2) made with\r\nknowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts;  (3) with the intention that it should be\r\nacted on;  <em>(4) to a party without knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the facts; </em>\r\n(5) who detrimentally relies on the representations.  <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins</em>, 962 S.W.2d at\r\n516-17 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, we conclude that the fraud question was not\r\nsubmitted as an independent common-law defense to the four-year statute of limitations\r\nand will not support a deferral of accrual of limitations<em>.  See id.</em>   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn jury question five, a similar submission problem of the jury charge obtains.  In a\r\nseries of three questions, the jury is first asked in question three whether appellant's failure\r\nto comply with the agreement was excused because of waiver.  The jury responded \"no.\" \r\nQuestion four was predicated upon a \"yes\" answer and instructed the jury to  specify which\r\nyears in which the waiver occurred.  The jury followed the court's instructions and did not\r\nanswer question four.  Question five was predicated again upon a \"yes\" answer to question\r\nfour and should not have been answered under the charge.<sup> (4)</sup>  Again, viewing the charge as\r\na whole, the first five issues deal with the breach of contract claims.  The questions asked\r\nin substance whether appellant agreed to pay additional rent, whether appellant failed to\r\ncomply with the agreement, whether the failure was excused by waiver, in what years did\r\nthe waiver occur, and whether the failure of appellees to exercise any rights under the\r\nlease was excused.  Once again, question five was not submitted as an independent\r\ncommon-law defense to the four year statute of limitations to support a deferral of accrual\r\nof limitations<em>.  See id.</em>  However, even assuming arguendo that question five submitted\r\nequitable estoppel in a substantially correct form, appellees are burdened with the jurors'\r\nanswer to question fourteen.  There, the finders of fact concluded that by 1985, appellees\r\nbecame aware that \"grain sales income was not being used by Southwest Grain Co. to\r\ncalculate rental payments.\"  This was the gravamen of appellees' breach of contract\r\nclaims.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe also observe that hundreds of mega-sized Mexican grain trucks traversed\r\nappellees' Rio Grande City property, year after year.  It is difficult to contend that \r\nlandowners could somehow be ignorant of millions of dollars worth of grain being trucked\r\nthrough  their property.  <em>See Barfield v. Howard M.

The estoppel\r\neffect is not permanent.  Fraudulent concealment merely tolls or suspends the statute of\r\nlimitations until the time the plaintiff learns of the facts that give rise to his cause of action\r\nor should learn of the facts in the exercise of reasonable diligence.  As with any form of\r\nequitable estoppel, a party asserting fraudulent concealment must have relied reasonably\r\non appellant's lies or improper silence.  Once appellees knew or should have known of the\r\ndeceit, reliance is no longer reasonable, and the tolling effect ends.  <em>Arabian Shield\r\nDevelopment Co. v.

Appellant calculated and paid additional\r\nrent to appellees for many years.  Appellees accepted and cashed all rent checks. \r\nAccording to appellant, appellees were furnished summary sheets and backup records\r\ndetailing the additional rent calculations.  Appellees hired certified public accountants and\r\na law firm to audit the material records beginning in 1987.  Appellant also hired a CPA in\r\n1997 to provide another explanation of the rent calculations.  Despite knowing how the rent\r\nwas being calculated, appellees accepted and cashed all rent checks prior to the lawsuit,\r\naccording to appellant.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees counter that appellant did not prove that appellees intended to waive their\r\nrights to additional rents, citing <em>Enserch Corp. v.

We agree.  The key element in establishing waiver is the\r\nintent of the alleged waiving party.  <em>Id.</em>  The very factors argued by appellant, that appellees\r\ncontinued to ask for records and complained the additional rents were not being properly\r\ncalculated, demonstrate a lack of intent to waive their rights under the contracts.  Appellees\r\nalso made some notations on checks and correspondence expressing their concern that\r\nappellant was not complying with the contract.  Further, as argued by appellee, \"waiver by\r\nimplication should not be inferred contrary to the intention of the party whose rights would\r\nbe injuriously affected thereby, unless the opposite party has been misled to his or her\r\nprejudice.\" <em> Id.</em> (citing <em>Cecil Pond Const.

Appellant neither alleges nor points us to any\r\nevidence that it was somehow prejudiced or misled by paying less than the agreed upon\r\nadditional rents for many years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe various annual leases also contained an express non-waiver clause.  Appellees\r\nargue such clauses are valid and enforceable.  We agree.  Although non-waiver clauses\r\nmay themselves be waived, they are generally considered valid and enforceable.  <em>A.G.E.,\r\nInc. v.

App.-Austin 2003, pet. denied).  Appellant\r\npoints to no evidence in the record that appellees expressly or impliedly waived this clause\r\nof the contract.  We would also note that each contract had a period of one year.  The non-waiver clause was thus renewed year after year.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, the law also indicates that when a person accepting benefits does not have\r\nknowledge of all material facts, ratification or estoppel cannot ensue from acceptance of\r\nthe benefits.  <em>Herschbach v.

The record is also devoid of evidence that appellant was prejudiced by appellees'\r\nacceptance of lesser monies for additional rent.

Similarily, a directed verdict is improper\r\nwhen the evidence offered on an issue is sufficient to raise an issue of fact.  <em>See Guzman,\r\n</em>63 S.W.3d at 528.  And, there being sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings of no\r\nwaiver, the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for new trial on this issue.  <em>Oyster\r\nCreek Financial Corp. v.

Ambiguity</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, appellant argues the additional rent\r\nprovision of the lease contracts is ambiguous.  It claims the lease contracts are reasonably\r\nsusceptible to more than one meaning.  The challenged provision states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t5.  Additional Rent.  LESSEE further agrees to pay LESSORS without prior\r\nnotice or demand at their address listed on the last page hereof, or such\r\nother place as LESSORS may designate in writing, as additional rent for the\r\nleased premises, a sum equal to the amount by which One and 66/100\r\n(1.66%) percent of LESSEE'S gross sales in any lease year exceeds\r\nLESSEE'S annual rental for such year.  In this connection, the terms \"lease\r\nyear\", \"annual rental\", \"gross rental\" and \"sales premises shall mean as\r\nfollows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tC.  \"Gross Sales\": The total amount of the dollar value of all sales of\r\ngoods, services or combination thereof, and all revenue of every kind\r\nand character derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of\r\na business or business activities conducted on the sales premises .\r\n. . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tD.  \"Sales Premises\": The real property presently leased by LESSEE\r\nfrom the Rio Grande City Consolidated Independent School District\r\nand served by the easement herein granted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t6.  <span>Records</span>.  LESSEE shall maintain (according to good accounting\r\npractices) full and accurate books and records with respect to the gross\r\nsales made at or from the sales premises . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to appellant, the disputed language relates to the definition of \"gross\r\nsales.\"  Appellant argues that the language \"derived from and, arising out of, or payable\r\non account of a business or business activities conducted on the sales premises\" pertains\r\nonly to specific activities conducted on the leased premises.  Appellant claims that\r\nappellees' interpretation relates to other activities off premises \"if those activities are even\r\nremotely connected to the other . . . .\"  Appellant concludes by arguing that a written\r\ninstrument is ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or it is reasonably\r\nsusceptible to more than one meaning, taking into consideration the circumstances present\r\nwhen the instrument was executed.  Appellant cites and quotes from<em> Towers of Texas, Inc.\r\nv. J &amp; J Sys., Inc</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1495041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1495041/towers-of-texas-inc-v-j-j-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (Tex. 1992).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees counter that the language is not ambiguous and to the contrary, is clear. \r\nThe leases required appellant to pay additional rent as a percentage of the company's\r\n\"gross sales.\"  Gross sales are broadly and clearly defined as, \"[t]he total amount of the\r\ndollar value of all sales of goods, services or combination thereof, and all revenue of every\r\nkind and character derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of a business or\r\nbusiness activities conducted on the sales premises . . . .\"  Appellees also point out that\r\ncounsel for appellant argued in his motion for directed verdict: \"In connection with the\r\ntheory of recovery related to contract and breach of contract, the intent of the parties is\r\nclear.\"  However, in context, counsel went on to say that to the extent the contract may be\r\nambiguous, the evidence showed the clear intent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees further argue that appellant cannot create an ambiguity by combing the\r\n\"records\" provision of the lease.  The \"records\" provision simply mandates books be kept\r\nregarding gross sales \"at and from\" the sales premises.  This phrasing is not inconsistent\r\nwith the gross sales provision \"derived from, arising out of, or payable on account of a\r\nbusiness or business activities conducted on the sales premises . . . .\"  In our view, the\r\nrecords-keeping provision is a lesser included, more narrow provision, which is itself\r\nincluded in the broader definition of \"gross sales.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA contract is not ambagious if it can be given a certain or definite legal meaning.\r\n<em>Lopez v. Munoz, Hockema &amp; Reed, L.L.P.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376524\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376524/lopez-v-munoz-hockema-reed-llp/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, 861 (Tex. 2000).  Whether a\r\ncontract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide.  <em>Id.</em>  In construing\r\ncontracts, we ascertain and give effect to the parties' intentions as expressed in the\r\ndocument.  <em>Id.</em>  Ambiguity does not arise simply because the parties advance conflicting\r\ninterpretations of the contract;  rather, for an ambiguity to exist, both interpretations must\r\nbe reasonable.  <em>Id.</em>  We agree that the contract language is unambiguous because it can\r\nbe given a definite legal meaning, and it is not reasonably susceptible to more than one\r\nmeaning.  <em>Id.</em>  Appellant's issue six is overruled.  Because appellant's issues seven, eight,\r\nnine, and ten are predicated upon the assumption that the contract was ambiguous, they\r\nare also overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t5. The Court's Charge</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant attacks the trial court's rulings on the charge in issues eleven, twelve,\r\nthirteen, and fourteen.  In issue eleven, appellant claims the trial court would not allow\r\nappellant to \"object to the charge.\"  More appropriately, appellant's actual complaint at the\r\ncharge conference was that the trial judge did rule on appellant's objections and refused\r\nissues, but did not allow appellant to reiterate its objections.  Appellant attempted to repeat\r\nthe same identical objection over and over again to each of his requested and refused\r\nissues.  The trial court marked each request refused, signed the refusal, and overruled\r\nappellant's objection to the refusal.  The standard of review for error in a jury charge is\r\nabuse of discretion.  <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1666410\"><a href=\"/opinion/1666410/in-re-vlk/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 341 (Tex.2000).  Contrary to appellant's\r\nassertion, the trial court did rule upon appellant's objections.  Thus, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em>  We overrule this issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its issue number twelve, appellant argues the trial court erred in refusing its issue\r\non anticipatory repudiation of the contract.  When appellees filed suit on February 23,\r\n1998, they also requested and obtained a temporary restraining order against appellant. \r\nAccording to appellant, this effectively deprived appellant of the use of the property and\r\nthus appellant repudiated the contract.  The restraining order was stayed four days later\r\nby this Court.  No permanent injunction ensued.  After four days, parties did business as\r\nusual.  Appellant cites <em>Group Life and Health Ins. Co. v. Turner</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425571\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425571/group-life-and-health-ins-co-v-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span>, 672-73\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.-Dallas 1981, no writ) (repudiation is conduct which shows a fixed intention\r\nto abandon, renounce, and refuse to perform the contract, without just excuse).  The\r\nprimary thrust of the restraining order was to prohibit the spoliation of evidence by\r\nappellant.  Appellant points to no evidence in the record that appellees had a fixed intent\r\nto renounce and refuse to perform the contract.<sup> (6)</sup>  In fact, appellees' original petition,\r\ncontaining the request for the restraining order, was to enforce the contract, not renounce\r\nit.  We find no abuse of discretion by the court's refusal of appellant's repudiation issue. \r\n<em>See</em> <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24 S.W.3d at 341.  We overrule this issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its thirteenth issue, appellant complains of error by the trial court in refusing a jury\r\nissue asking in which years the contract was breached.  This question was already\r\nincluded in two places, that is, in damage questions fifteen and sixteen.  These questions \r\ninquired on a year-by-year basis what damages were proximately caused by appellant's\r\nconduct.  Furthermore, as appellees suggest, there was no dispute that appellant did not\r\npay the claimed additional rent in each of the years that damages were found by the jury. \r\nAppellant argued in trial, as it does on appeal, that it had properly calculated additional rent\r\nbased only on the transfer charges.  Appellant also contended that it did not owe anything\r\non McCook sales and that those sales, even if the grain went through Rio Grande City,\r\nwere not sales of goods, or revenue arising out of, or payable on account of a business or\r\nbusiness activities conducted in Rio Grande City.  Stated otherwise, appellant's defense\r\nwas consistent for each year and it did not argue or present evidence that appellees'\r\nclaims or its defenses were somehow different in different years.<sup> (7)</sup>  Therefore, the trial court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion by refusing the requested issue both because the issue was\r\nnot raised and, in any event, was covered by questions 15 and 16.  <em>See</em> <em>In re V.L.K.</em>, 24\r\nS.W.3d at 341; <em>Bedford v. Moore</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1380246\"><a href=\"/opinion/1380246/bedford-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 458 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2005, no\r\npet.) (to have a question submitted to the jury, there must be a proper legal theory, and\r\nthere must be sufficient evidence adduced to warrant its submission).  We overrule this\r\nissue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t6. Appellant's Attorney's Fees</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNext appellant complains it was entitled to an issue on attorney's fees.  Appellant\r\ncites no authority that would allow its recovery of attorney's fees when unsuccessfully\r\ndefending a breach of contract case.  This issue was properly rejected by the trial court. \r\nAppellant did not prevail and even a successful defense of a contract claim does not allow\r\nattorney's fees unless provided by contract.  <em>Horizontal Holes, Inc. v. River Valley\r\nEnterprises, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399610\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399610/horizontal-holes-v-river-valley-enter/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 835-36 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2006, no pet.).  The civil\r\npractices and remedies code allows a party to recover such fees if the party prevails on a\r\ncause of action for which attorney's fees are recoverable and recovers damages.  Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001(8) (Vernon 1997); <em>Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382247/green-intern-inc-v-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 390 (Tex. 1997).  However, a party who does not recover for breach of contract\r\ncannot recover attorney's fees under that theory.  <em>Horizontal Holes, Inc</em>. 197 S.W.3d at\r\n835-36.  Appellant's fourteenth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t7. Credits</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues sixteen and nineteen, appellant contends that the jury did not properly\r\ncredit it for additional rent payments actually made by appellant.  While the jury properly\r\ndeducted base rent paid from the damages found, it did not deduct additional rent\r\npayments made by appellant.  Appellees argue waiver of the issue which we addressed\r\nabove.  Thereafter, appellees inform us that \"it appears that the jury failed to give credit for\r\nadditional rent actually paid.\"  We agree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs we discussed in the limitations issue supra, no claims or damages before\r\nFebruary 23, 1994, should be allowed and therefore, no credits before that date are\r\nallowed.  The amounts of additional rents already paid are found on appellant's exhibit\r\nseven.  Credits should have been deducted from the damages awarded to Abel N.\r\nGonzalez, Jr. and Aida Graciela Gonzalez in the amount of $19,405.03, and a similar credit\r\nshould have been deducted from the damages awarded to Martin Garza in like amount. \r\nWe sustain issue nineteen, and modify the judgment accordingly. <em> See</em> Tex. R. App. P.\r\n43.2(b).<sup> (8)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t8. Appellees' Attorney's Fees</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its issues seventeen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, and twenty-four, appellant argues: (1) no attorney's fees should be awarded; (2) improper award of\r\nattorney's fees; (3) a contingent fee was improper; (4) the amount awarded was too large;\r\nand (5) alternatively, appellees' award of attorney's fees should be adjusted.  Appellant\r\nbegins its argument by insisting that the attorney's fees must be segregated between the\r\nfraud and contract claims, as well as the defense of the counter-claim.  It cites <em>Crow v.\r\nCentral Soya Co., Inc</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772677\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772677/crow-v-central-soya-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 396 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1983, ref. n.r.e.) (fees\r\nattributable to the defense of a counterclaim are not recoverable unless the facts\r\nnecessary for the plaintiff to recover also serve to defeat the counterclaim).  We agree. \r\nAppellant also cites <em>Bray v. Curtis</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512534\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512534/bray-v-curtis/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 820 (Tex. Civ. App.-Corpus Christi\r\n1976, ref. n.r.e.) (unless attorney's fees are provided by statute, or by a contract between\r\nthe parties, such fees are not recoverable).  Again, we agree.  Finally, appellant cites\r\n<em>Panizo v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n of Greater Houston Area</em>, 938 S.W.2d 163,170\r\n(Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ).  <em>Panizo</em> holds that a party seeking attorney's\r\nfees usually has a duty to segregate nonrecoverable fees from recoverable fees and to\r\nsegregate the fees owed by different parties.  <em>Id.</em>  However, it also reiterates the historical\r\nexception to the duty to segregate when the attorney's fees rendered are in connection with\r\nclaims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or\r\ndefense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts. <em>Id.</em> (citing <em>Stewart Title Guar.\r\nCo. v. Sterling</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1679425\"><a href=\"/opinion/1679425/stewart-title-guar-co-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (Tex.1991)). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> \tThe supreme court has recently reaffirmed the rule that if any attorney's fees relate\r\nsolely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate\r\nrecoverable from unrecoverable fees.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>,  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 313 (Tex. 2006).  Intertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable per se; it is only\r\nwhen discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they\r\nare so intertwined that they need not be segregated.  <em>Id.</em>  The court modified <em>Sterling</em> to\r\nthat extent.  <em>Id.</em> at 314. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhether fees can be segregated between various claims historically has been a\r\nquestion for the court.  <em>Cotten v. Weatherford Bancshares, Inc</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102254/cotten-v-weatherford-bancshares-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 709 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied).  Again, <em>Tony Gullo Motors </em>somewhat modifies that\r\nrule indicating that sometimes the matters in issue are more a mixed question of law and\r\nfact for the jury.  <em>Tony Gullo Motors,</em> 212 S.W.3d at 313.  Here, the duties of the parties\r\narose out of a single contract that was renewed year after year.  The same facts necessary\r\nfor appellees to establish their breach of contract claims would also inure to the defense\r\nof appellant's counter-claim, both in pre-trial discovery, and during the trial itself.  Whether\r\nor not appellant fraudulently concealed vital information concerning the additional rents or\r\ncommitted fraud was also intertwined with both the assertions and defenses of all the\r\nparties regarding recovery under the contract.  Discovery, voir dire, examination of the\r\nwitnesses, and most every aspect of the trial required the same attorney services in order\r\nto prove or disprove these contentions.  <em>See id.</em>  We conclude that the discrete legal\r\nservices advanced both recoverable and unrecoverable claims that were so intertwined\r\nthat they need not be segregated.  <em>Id.</em>  These issues are overruled.<sup> (9)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith regard to appellant's issue contesting the contingent fee award, appellant cites\r\n<em>Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. v.

The record here\r\ndecidedly departs from the appellant's authorities.  First, we are not dealing with either a\r\nDTPA claim or a jury submission requesting a percentage answer.  <em>See Arthur Andersen\r\n&amp; Co. </em> 945 S.W.2d at 818-19.  Second, appellees duly supported their claim for attorney's\r\nfees through the testimony of both of appellees' trial counsel.  <em>Cf. Lubbock County</em>, 953\r\nS.W.2d at 858 (finding insufficient evidence where jury was asked to award attorney's fees\r\nas a percentage of damages).  Counsel for appellant also testified about the\r\nreasonableness and necessity of his attorney's fees.  Appellees' counsel's testimony\r\ncovered, in varying degrees, the eight factors found in the rules of professional conduct. \r\n<em>See</em> Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof'l Conduct 1.04; <em>see also Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. </em> 945\r\nS.W.2d at 818-19.  This issue is overruled as to the argument that any contingent award\r\nwas improper.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant next argues the fees are excessive, citing <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. v.

Over 1000 hours were spent on this matter by appellees' two trial counsel.  Given\r\nthe difficulty and novelty of the questions involved, the time, the preclusion of other\r\nemployment, the usual and customary fees charged, the amounts involved, the result, the\r\nnature and length of the professional relationships with the clients, the experience,\r\nreputation, and ability of the lawyers performing the services, and the fact that the\r\nattorney's fees contract was contingent, based upon the jury's verdict we would not\r\nconclude the attorney's fees were excessive.  <em>See</em> <em>Id.</em>; Tex.

However, the fact that we have substantially reduced the damage award,\r\nwhich dated back to 1985, also works to change one of the most significant factors to be\r\nconsidered by the fact finder, i.e., the results obtained.  <em>Id.</em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, appellant also contends that, even if appellees were properly awarded\r\nattorney's fees based upon a contingent fee contract, the jury's award should be adjusted\r\nto reflect a percentage of the actual damages recoverable.  The jury's attorney's fees\r\nquestion asked for a total dollar amount to be awarded appellees.  Both sides agree that\r\nthe award was based upon a contingent fee.  The percentages awarded were supported\r\nby the testimony of Mr. Ramirez for an amount of 36% through trial, 40% if appealed to the\r\ncourt of appeals, and 45% if reviewed by the Texas Supreme Court.  According to the\r\nrecord, these calculations were clearly based upon the recovery of additional rents dating\r\nback to 1985.  We have disallowed any recovery on claims for damages before February\r\n23, 1994.  Therefore, we must likewise disallow any attorney's fees for any recovery before\r\nFebruary 23, 1994.  <em>See Argonaut Ins. Co.</em>, 582 S.W.2d at 889.  While in this case, it would\r\nseem that a remittitur is easily discernable, as we read the Texas Supreme Court's latest\r\npronouncement, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the jury as to how much\r\nweight to give the \"results obtained\" factor and how to balance that factor in conjunction\r\nwith the evidence of each of the other factors the jury was instructed to consider in\r\nawarding attorney's fees.  <em>Barker v. Eckman</em>, 2006 Tex. LEXIS 1187, at *18-20, 50 Tex.\r\nSup. Ct. J. 175 (Tex. Dec. 1, 2006).  Nor may we apparently use a \"presumptive\r\nproportionality\" to effectuate a remittitur of attorneys fees.<sup> (10)</sup>  <em>Id.</em> at *19-*20 (citing <em>Tatum v.\r\nPreston Carter Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1744974\"><a href=\"/opinion/1744974/tatum-v-preston-carter-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 188 (Tex. 1986)) (holding that court of appeals erred\r\nin proportionally reducing exemplary damages in the exact ratio as the actual damages\r\nwere reduced).  We conclude that for us to simply reduce or remit excessive attorney's\r\nfees according to the percentages found by the jury is problematic.

New Trial Granted</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its final issue, appellant contends the trial court erred by granting a new trial in\r\nJanuary 2003 allegedly based on jury misconduct.  In any event, the new trial was granted\r\n\"in the interests of justice.\"  Appellees cite <em>Wilkins v.

Retired Fourteenth Court of Appeals Justice Don Wittig assigned to this Court by Chief Justice of the \r\nSupreme Court of Texas pursuant to the government code.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 74.003 (Vernon 2005).\r\n</p><p>2.  Appellants do not contend that the discovery rule applies.\r\n</p><p>3.   At oral argument, appellees argued that there was no dispute about the base rent and that, of\r\ncourse, appellees knew that grain sales were not being used to calculate the base rent.  This argument was\r\nnot raised by objection at the charge conference or in appellees' brief and is therefore waived.  In any event,\r\nin context of the charge as a whole, the only time rent was to be based on grain sales was in the application\r\nof the 1.66% of gross sales as additional rent.   According to the record, the two primary sources of gross\r\nsales were, first and foremost, grain sales, and to a much lesser degree, transfer charges generated by the\r\nRio Grande City facility. The voluminous records introduced by appellees were grain sales, which were the\r\nsine qua non of appellees' claims.  Without the grain sales in question, no additional rent was due, other than\r\nthat due for transfer fees already paid by appellant.  Appellant contended throughout that it only owed the\r\ntransfer fees.  Appellees contended throughout that additional rent was also due on the grain sales.\r\n</p><p>4.   As indicated above, the predicate to question five was incorrectly worded.  A more appropriate\r\nwording would have been:  \"If you answered by specifying any year or years to any part of question 4, then\r\nanswer yes or no as to each of the corresponding individuals.  Otherwise do not answer this question.\"\r\n</p><p>5.   Appellant could well have been guilty of fraud or fraudulent concealment before 1985.  But, by that\r\ndate, appellees were charged with knowledge that appellants were not paying additional rents based upon\r\ngrain sales.   Appellant's consistent approach, well known to appellees, was to base additional rent solely upon\r\ntransfer fees at the Rio Grande facility.\r\n</p><p>6.  Pleadings are ordinarily not evidence.  <em>See Laidlaw Waste Sys. (Dallas), Inc. v. City of Wilmer</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523453/laidlaw-waste-systems-dallas-v-wilmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 660 (Tex. 1995).\r\n</p><p>7.   The primary variation of the evidence between the years was the amount of sales and damages,\r\nnot that different types of breaches occurred or that appellant's defense varied.\r\n</p><p>8.   Issue sixteen is accordingly moot.\r\n</p><p>9.   Appellant's first two arguments are overlapping and are overruled.  In any event, upon remand, the\r\ntrial court and/or jury will be required to follow the new precedent set in <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, \r\n<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 310 - 314(Tex. 2006). \r\n</p><p>10.  It is not at all clear that a presumptive proportionality could not be used where the parties agree the\r\nattorney's fees award were largely based upon a fixed contingent fee contract and  where, as here, the\r\npercentages found by the jury are clear.  Nor should <em>Tatum</em> apply when the record demonstrates the patent\r\ncontractual basis for the jury's findings.  <em>Cf. Tatum v. Preston Carter Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1744974\"><a href=\"/opinion/1744974/tatum-v-preston-carter-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 188 (Tex. 1986).\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",
