Plaintiffs allege that Cuba provided material support to the Fuerzas Armadas\n\nRevolucionarias de Colombia, a designated foreign terrorist organization commonly known as “the\n\nFARC,” which made possible the FARC’s shooting down of their aircraft, extrajudicial killing of\n\nTom Janis, and the hostage-taking and torture of Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves, and Thomas\n\nHowes. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes seek money damages for the pain and suffering they\n\nendured during their 1,967 days of captivity. The widow and children of Tom Janis seek solatium\n\ndamages for the emotional trauma of losing their husband and father.\n\n         Cuba has never entered an appearance in this action. The Clerk of Court entered an order\n\nof default against Cuba, and Plaintiffs moved for an entry of default judgment. After thorough\n\nconsideration of the evidence and briefing presented, the court grants Plaintiffs’ motion.\n\fI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         The court begins with a summary of the factual background leading up to the terrorist acts\n\nat issue, a description of those acts, and the procedural history of this case. To do so, the court\n\ndraws upon the allegations in the Complaint, affidavits from Plaintiffs, the sworn testimony of two\n\nexpert witnesses, and the official Central Intelligence Agency and United States Department of\n\nState annual reports on state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide. Additionally, the court takes\n\njudicial notice of the Stipulated Statement of Offense entered in United States v. Herrera and\n\nincorporates that statement as part of its findings of fact.1 See Stip. Stmt. of Offense in Supp. of\n\nGuilty Plea, United States v. Herrera, No. 10-cr-339-15 (D.D.C. 2014), ECF No. 64 [hereinafter\n\nStmt. of Offense].\n\n         A.        Cuba’s State Sponsorship of Terrorism\n\n         The FARC is a designated foreign terrorist organization existing and operating primarily\n\nin the Republic of Colombia. See 8 U.S.C. § 1189(a)(1); Pls.’ Notice of Filing App’x Vol. I, ECF\n\nNo. 16 [hereinafter Pls.’ Ex. List I], U.S. DEP’T OF STATE, Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2001\n\n(May 2002), ECF No. 16-20, at 6. The group’s predominant goal is to overthrow the Colombian\n\ngovernment. Throughout its years of existence, the FARC has sought to destabilize the existing\n\ngovernment through acts of violence, including murders, hostage takings, and bombings. See\n\nStmt. of Offense ¶ 2; Pls.’ Ex. List I, U.S. DEP’T OF STATE, Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1997\n\n\n1\n  The court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Take Judicial Notice as to the Stipulated Statement of Offense entered in\nUnited States v. Herrera. See Pls.’ Mot. to Take Judicial Notice, ECF No. 25; Stip. Stmt. of Offense in Supp. of\nGuilty Plea, United States v. Herrera, No. 10-cr-339-15 (D.D.C. 2014), ECF No. 64. A court may take judicial notice\nof a fact not subject to reasonable dispute, either because it is “generally known” or can be “accurately and readily\ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). It is well\nestablished that a court may “take judicial notice of, and give effect to, its own records in another but interrelated\nproceeding,” Booth v. Fletcher, 101 F.3d 676, 679 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1938), and courts adjudicating FSIA claims often\nelect to do so, see e.g., Roth v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 78 F. Supp. 3d 379, 387 (D.D.C. 2015). In United States v.\nHerrera, this court oversaw the criminal prosecution of one of the terrorists responsible for the very acts of terrorism\nat issue here. Accordingly, that case is one “interrelated” to the present civil litigation and the court will take judicial\nnotice of the Stipulated Statement of Offense in making its findings of fact. See Roth, 78 F. Supp. 3d at 387.\n\n                                                             2\n\f(Apr. 1998), ECF No. 16-16, at 4; Decl. of Expert Witness Pedro Roig, ECF No. 15 [hereinafter\n\nRoig Decl.], at 12. In 1964, the FARC became inspired by the Cuban Revolution and sought\n\nassistance, advice, and support from the Cuban government. Aff. of Expert Witness Luis Miguel\n\nCote Gómez, ECF No. 14 [hereinafter Cote Aff.], ¶ 27.\n\n       Throughout the time period relevant to this lawsuit, Cuba was led by Fidel and Raul Castro.\n\nId. The Castro brothers exercised complete control over all matters of government, which made\n\nthem, in effect, the Cuban government. Id. Consequently, the brothers’ “decisions to provide\n\nsupport and resources to . . . the FARC and to destabilize democracies in Latin America were . . .\n\ndecisions made . . . [by] the Cuban government and state.” See id.; Roig Decl. at 5.\n\n       Cuba supported the FARC in a number of ways. For example, Cuba provided military,\n\nexplosives, and weapons training to FARC members in camps organized in Venezuela. Cote Aff.\n\n¶ 31; Roig Decl. at 24. Through their Cuban allies, the FARC also gained communications training\n\nand expertise in intelligence gathering techniques. See Cote Aff. ¶ 30. Havana served as a safe\n\nhaven for FARC members. Id. ¶ 28; Roig Decl. at 14–15. Additionally, through its relationship\n\nwith the Venezuelan government, Cuba facilitated the FARC’s ability to move across the\n\nColombian-Venezuelan border undetected, which made it easier not only for Cuban officials to\n\nprovide resources and advice to the FARC, but also for FARC members to access international\n\nflights, engage in drug trafficking, and evade international efforts to thwart their operations. Cote\n\nAff. ¶¶ 43, 47; Roig Decl. at 16, 19–20, 25.\n\n       B.      The Events of February 13, 2003, and Subsequent Years of Captivity and\n               Torture\n\n       On February 13, 2003, an aircraft performing a counter-narcotics surveillance flight over\n\nColombia on behalf of the United States Embassy came under fire from the FARC and experienced\n\nengine failure. On board were four American civilian contractors—Tom Janis, Keith Stansell,\n\n                                                 3\n\fMarc Gonsalves, and Thomas Howes—and one Colombian citizen, Luis Alcides Cruz. All five\n\npassengers survived the crash landing. Shortly thereafter, FARC members surrounded the aircraft\n\nand took the men hostage, separating Stansell, Howes, and Gonsalves from Janis and Cruz. The\n\nterrorists marched the first group of men into the jungle, where they would be held captive and\n\ntortured for more than five years. Janis and Cruz were shot, execution-style, and their bodies left\n\nnear the crash site. See Stmt. of Offense ¶¶ 6–7, 8–12, 15; Cote Aff. ¶¶ 20, 44, 45(a)–(b); Pls.’\n\nNotice of Filing App’x Vol. II, ECF No. 17 [hereinafter Pls.’ Ex. List II], Ex. 1, Aff. of Keith\n\nStansell, ECF No. 17-1 [hereinafter Stansell Aff.], ¶¶ 2, 10; Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 2, Aff. of Marc\n\nGonsalves, ECF No. 17-2 [hereinafter Gonsalves Aff.], ¶¶ 2, 9; Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 3, Aff. of\n\nThomas Howes, ECF No. 17-3 [hereinafter Howes Aff.], ¶¶ 2, 10.\n\n       Members of the FARC informed the hostages that their continued detention would increase\n\ninternational pressure and allow the FARC to leverage concessions from the Colombian\n\ngovernment in exchange for their release. Stmt. of Offense ¶ 10. In late July 2003, the FARC sent\n\na videotape of the hostages to media outlets in the United States to prove the hostages were still\n\nalive. On the video, the FARC demanded that, in exchange for the release of the American\n\nhostages, Colombia release all FARC members held in Colombian prisons and create a\n\ndemilitarized zone for the FARC. Id. ¶ 11.\n\n       During their time with the FARC, Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes experienced\n\nextraordinarily cruel and dehumanizing treatment. The terrorists forced their hostages to march\n\nfor miles in the jungle without the benefit of proper equipment or rest, going to great lengths to\n\nconceal their location and the hostages’ identities. The hostages lost substantial weight and the\n\npads on the balls of their feet were worn to the bone as a result of carrying heavy weight on their\n\nback while trekking miles each day in rugged terrain without proper footwear. Stansell Aff. ¶¶ 4(i),\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f5; Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 4(i), 5; Howes Aff. ¶¶ 4(i), 5. To control the hostages, the FARC used “choke\n\nharnesses, ropes, chains, padlocks, and wires to bind the [hostages’] necks and wrists.” Stmt. of\n\nOffense ¶ 15. The terrorists then chained the hostages to trees or one another for months or even\n\nyears at a time. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(vi), (x); Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(viii); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ix). The food\n\nthe hostages received was rotten, tainted with gasoline, and stored in containers previously used\n\nto store agricultural chemicals. Howes Aff. ¶ 11.\n\n       The hostages lived in traumatic and unsanitary conditions. The FARC kept the men in\n\ntight enclosures—such as wooden boxes or barbed wire cages—without toilet facilities of any\n\nkind. If one of the hostages needed to relieve himself, then he had to ask permission; the FARC\n\nmembers often humiliated him for asking or denied permission altogether. The men regularly\n\nwere forced to defecate where they were chained, causing the enclosures to become covered in\n\nfeces. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(xii); Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 4(vii)–(viii); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(iii).\n\n       Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes each suffered from a plethora of debilitating illnesses. For\n\nexample, on four different occasions, Howes suffered from fly larva growing under his skin that\n\nhad to be killed by cigarette nicotine and squeezed from his flesh. Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ii). The water\n\nand food the men received were dirty, causing them regular digestive problems. Gonsalves Aff. ¶\n\n4(ii); cf. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(i); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ii). More seriously, Gonsalves and Howes developed\n\na skin rotting disease called leishmaniasis. Despite having the medication with which to treat the\n\ninfection and seeing the men in great need, the FARC repeatedly denied them the medication.\n\nGonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(v); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ii), (v).\n\n       The medical attention the hostages did receive sometimes caused more harm than good.\n\nFor example, Stansell’s hip became infected as a result of receiving spoiled medicine, causing a\n\nbaseball-sized cyst to grow, rot, and burst. The FARC cut the cyst out of Stansell’s hip using a\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fscalpel, without any anesthetic or other pain medication. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(iv). Similarly, although\n\nGonsalves ultimately received the leishmaniasis medication, the FARC re-used needles for his\n\ntreatments, causing him to contract hepatitis. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(v). In an effort to treat the\n\nhepatitis, the FARC injected Gonsalves, against his will, with a variety of unknown drugs that\n\ncaused him additional pain and suffering. Id.\n\n        FARC members also regularly punished their hostages. Sometimes they added chains or\n\npadlocks to the already heavy chains the hostages wore. Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ix). They also starved\n\nthe hostages while subjecting them to exhausting marches through the jungle. Gonsalves Aff. ¶\n\n4(iv); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(iv). In one instance in particular, after a fellow hostage escaped, the FARC\n\npunished Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes by requiring them to stand in a small space filled with\n\nlarge drums of gasoline and sealed off by thick gauge black plastic, forcing them to inhale the\n\ngasoline fumes. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(viii).\n\n        In addition to harming the hostages physically, the terrorists also inflicted extreme mental\n\npain and suffering. They forced Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes into solitary confinement and\n\nprohibited them from speaking with anyone for months on end, causing the men to grow hoarse\n\nfrom not using their vocal chords. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(v); Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(iii); Howes Aff. ¶ 6.\n\nAlthough the hostages’ families tried to contact them by sending messages through the United\n\nStates Embassy, these messages were never delivered. Stansell Aff. ¶ 6. Additionally, despite\n\nhaving access to radios, the terrorists only permitted some of the men to listen periodically to hear\n\nmessages from their families. See Stansell Aff. ¶ 6; Howes Aff. ¶ 6; cf. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(iii).\n\nThe FARC also kept the Americans segregated from others, further isolating them. See Stansell\n\nAff. ¶ 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f       Furthermore, each of the men can recount specific acts that haunt him. Gonsalves recalls\n\none time being forced to carry a fifty-five pound backpack across a fallen tree “bridge” at gunpoint;\n\nthe bridge gave way while he was halfway across, causing him to fall more than four meters to the\n\nrocky bottom of a gully. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(i). Despite suffering a concussion and being unable\n\nto move one arm, the FARC forced Gonsalves to continue to carry the backpack another 15 miles\n\nthrough the jungle the following day and for the next several months. Id. Stansell testified that,\n\none night, while being held in a cage and hearing helicopters overhead, FARC members stood\n\nbeside the cage and began discussing how to kill the hostages. Hearing this, Stansell approached\n\nthe terrorists and asked that the FARC members shoot them cleanly, rather than spray them with\n\ngunfire and cause painful, non-lethal wounds from which they would suffer while dying. Stansell\n\nAff. ¶ 4(xii). Lastly, Howes remembers the terrorists threatening to kill not only the hostages, but\n\nalso any civilian with whom they came in contact. Consequently, he testified to the emotional\n\nhorror of accidentally encountering a family of five in the jungle and then later learning that the\n\nFARC murdered them all. See Howes Aff. ¶ 4(vii).\n\n       All three men lived in constant fear of death. The FARC required at least one of its\n\nmembers to be physically near the hostages at all times, and the hostages were explicitly told that,\n\nin the event of a rescue attempt, the guard would shoot them. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes\n\noften saw helicopters flying overhead and witnessed the guards prepare their guns and position\n\nthemselves to fire upon the hostages. On other occasions FARC members approached each\n\nhostage and directly threatened to kill him, sometimes even dry-firing a weapon to simulate an\n\nexecution. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(ix); Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(vi); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(vi).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f       After 1,967 days in captivity, the men were rescued on July 2, 2008, by the Colombian\n\nmilitary.

Cir. 2013) (permitting legal representative\n\nof a deceased petitioner to continue a suit under the FSIA terrorism exception on behalf of a\n\ndeceased petitioner).\n\n       D.      Injuries Sustained by the Victims and the Claimants\n\n               1.       The Victims\n\n       Keith Stansell suffers from premature deterioration of the discs in his spine, sensitivity in\n\nhis feet, and permanent pain in his right torso as a result of the long, forced marches he had to\n\nendure, at times with broken ribs. He struggles with ongoing digestive problems, and he had to\n\nundergo months-long treatment for the flesh eating virus he contracted in the jungle. His time with\n\nthe FARC left him permanently disfigured. The flesh eating virus scarred his neck, crotch, and\n\nlegs, and the heavy chains he was forced to wear scarred his neck and shoulders. He still has a\n\nknot under the skin on his right hip where a cyst burst and had to be excised. Stansell’s pain and\n\nsuffering is not limited to physical ailments. He mourns the time and life experiences the FARC\n\nstole from him—he missed the birth of his twin sons, many years of family memories and holidays,\n\nand time spent with loved ones. Lastly, he continues to struggle emotionally with managing the\n\npsychological pain caused by his captivity and isolation. Stansell Aff. ¶¶ 11–13.\n\n       Marc Gonsalves also experiences ongoing physical and emotional scars as a result of being\n\nheld hostage. He has physical pain in his knees, legs, back, and shoulders, as well as frequent\n\nmigraines. Gonsalves’s short-term memory has been dramatically reduced, which affects his\n\nability to perform day-to-day tasks. In addition to insomnia and nightmares, Gonsalves suffers\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\ffrom various “triggers”—often sounds or smells—that induce extreme anxiety and nervousness,\n\nas though he is once again being held captive. Helicopters, in particular, incite panic and make\n\nGonsalves feel as though he is about to be killed. He cannot be in small spaces or amongst even\n\nmoderate-sized groups of people indoors. Gonsalves’s marriage failed as a result of his emotional\n\ninstability, and he no longer lives with his children. He laments the time he could have spent with\n\nhis children as they grew up and the active role he wishes he could have played in raising them.\n\nGonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 10–12.\n\n       Thomas Howes, too, suffers physically and emotionally as a result of his time in captivity.\n\nHe has lived for years with intestinal parasites, deteriorated eyesight, constant sore throat,\n\nesophageal erosion, leg cramps, and constant pain in his knees, ankles, and neck. Further, he finds\n\nhimself consumed with stress, unable to stop worrying about how his experience in South America\n\nwith the FARC will affect his relationships and professional career. The emotional trauma he\n\nsuffered caused his marriage to fail, and he grieves the lost time with his family. Particularly\n\npainful for Howes was the passing of his father while he was being held by the FARC. Howes\n\nwas very close with his father, and in addition to losing the opportunity to say goodbye to him,\n\nHowes is emotionally scarred by the fact that his father suffered in his last days from knowing his\n\nson was kidnapped. Howes Aff. ¶ 11–13.\n\n               2.      The Claimants\n\n       Tom and Judith Janis were married for more than 30 years, and Tom was “the love of\n\n[Judith’s] life.” Jud. Janis Aff. ¶ 8. The couple raised four children together, and Judith was proud\n\nto be Tom’s wife, “knowing that no matter what life would bring [they] would get through it\n\ntogether.” Id. ¶ 11. Although Tom traveled frequently for work in Colombia, the couple never\n\nspent more than 10 days apart. Judith frequently traveled to Colombia to visit Tom. On the day\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fTom was murdered, Judith had been visiting; the couple kissed goodbye in the morning at the\n\nColombian airport, and Judith boarded a commercial flight home to Alabama. Id. ¶ 10. Judith\n\nremembers his smile, their kiss, and Tom saying: “See you in 10 days honey girl.” Id. Judith\n\nlearned Tom’s plane had crashed from two voicemails left on her answering machine while she\n\nwas traveling that day. Thirty-six hours later, the president of Tom’s company flew to Alabama\n\nto tell Judith in person that her husband had been killed. Id. ¶ 16. Judith spent years investigating\n\nthe details of Tom’s death. Only upon Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes returning to the United\n\nStates did Judith learn that the FARC had ordered Tom killed. Id. ¶ 17. Judith thinks of her late\n\nhusband every day and continues to grieve his death, 13 years later. When she learned of Tom’s\n\npassing, she “really didn’t believe that life could go on,” and today still feels “the other part of\n\n[her] is missing.” Id. ¶ 16. Tom’s absence is particularly pronounced on holidays, birthdays, and\n\nfamily gatherings. Id. ¶ 19. Judith has not remarried. Id. ¶¶ 3, 16.\n\n       Christopher Janis was 30 years old when his father was murdered. Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 5,\n\nAff. of Christopher Janis, ECF No. 17-5 [hereinafter C. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 2–3. He had a “close and\n\nloving relationship” with his father while growing up, and followed in Tom’s footsteps by enlisting\n\nin the Army. Id. ¶¶ 4, 9. In addition to teaching Christopher to drive and to water ski, Tom shared\n\na special relationship with his son over their parallel military service. Id. ¶¶ 4–6. Christopher’s\n\nlast memory of his father is from early 2003, when Tom drove Christopher to the assembly point\n\nfor Christopher’s deployment to Kuwait. Christopher remembers his father waving to him through\n\nthe window of the truck, smiling. Id. ¶ 7. Christopher learned of his father’s plane crash while in\n\nKuwait, on February 14, 2003. While in the Atlanta International Airport, Christopher’s wife told\n\nhim his father had died. See id. ¶ 11. The news caused Christopher to immediately lose his breath,\n\nbecome weak in the knees, and break down crying. He still hates the Atlanta airport today because\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fof that memory. Id. Christopher’s grief is continuous, particularly now that he has retired from\n\nthe military. Id. ¶ 13. He was looking forward to talking with his father about their combat\n\nexperiences and his feelings from his deployments. Id. ¶ 10. He tries to live his life in a manner\n\nof which his father would be proud, but feels his accomplishments are less rewarding without Tom\n\nhere to enjoy them with him. Id.\n\n        Greer Janis was 29 years old when Tom was murdered and she, too, shared a close and\n\nloving relationship with her father. Greer could talk to her father about “anything” and often\n\nsought her father’s advice. Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 7, Aff. of Greer Janis, ECF No. 17-7 [hereinafter\n\nG. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 3–4. She visited home frequently because it was “a place of acceptance,\n\ntolerance, and love.” Id. ¶ 4. Because Tom was murdered the day before Valentine’s Day,\n\nValentine’s Day became a “dark day” for Greer, causing her annually to “relive the horror” of\n\nhearing her mother tell her that her father’s plane had been out of contact with the radio tower. Id.\n\n¶ 6. Each Valentine’s Day, she “relive[d] the anxiety and trepidation of not knowing what had\n\nhappened, and was happening, to [her] dad.” Id. The first Christmas and New Year’s Eve without\n\nTom were difficult for Greer, particularly because New Year’s Eve was her parents’ wedding\n\nanniversary. See id. Greer thought of her father every day, and her grief and loss continued even\n\n13 years after his murder. Id. ¶ 9. She wished she could share moments in her life with Tom or\n\nseek his advice. See id. Greer feels pain every day because her father “was ripped away from\n\n[her] and [her] family.” Id. Tom was “an intrinsic part of [Greer’s] life” and his death “made a\n\nhole in [her] life.” Id. Greer died on July 26, 2016, at the age of 42. See G. Janis Death Certificate;\n\ncf. G. Janis Aff. ¶ 3.\n\n        Michael Janis was 25 years old when Tom was murdered. He, too, enjoyed a close and\n\nloving relationship with his father and, like Christopher, followed in his father’s footsteps by\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fbecoming an Army aviator. He is currently on active duty with the United States Army. Pls.’ Ex.\n\nList II, Ex. 6, Aff. of Michael Janis, ECF No. 17-6 [hereinafter M. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 3–4. Michael\n\ndescribes Tom as not only a father, but also a “very close friend.” Id. ¶ 4. He laments that they\n\nwill not get to share any more father-son talks and wishes Tom could have been there to see his\n\nwings pinned on his uniform after graduating from flight school. See id. ¶¶ 4–5. Every Father’s\n\nDay, Michael goes through a box of his father’s things, feeling sad because Tom “had so much\n\nmore life to live, so many more milestones, and moments with his children that [the family] [is]\n\nall missing.” Id. ¶ 6. Michael learned of the plane crash from seeing headlines on the Internet,\n\nand his wife and he took turns scouring websites for updates. Michael learned that his father had\n\nbeen killed when he heard his wife scream and saw CNN’s website reporting that Tom’s body had\n\nbeen found by the plane. He remembers the strangeness of seeing CNN misreport his father’s\n\nname as “Janis Thomas,” rather than “Thomas Janis,” and feeling “sick, confused, and scared for\n\n[his] mother.” See id. ¶ 8. Because his mother was still traveling back from Colombia, Michael\n\nhad to keep this information to himself for several hours, which was “utterly devastating.” Id.\n\nAlthough Michael “tries not to think of the worst moments of this tragedy,” id., he still finds it\n\n“next to impossible to choose to avoid the pain and emptiness his [father’s] murder brought to [his]\n\nfamily,” id. ¶ 4. Tom’s death has created a “darkness and emptiness” in his life. Michael blames\n\nTom’s murder for his divorce from his high school sweetheart, and he wishes he and Tom could\n\ntalk about serving overseas. Id. ¶¶ 10, 11. Michael has been unable to dream since Tom’s murder\n\nand has not yet found peace with Tom’s death, which “has been the most traumatic, painful, life-\n\naltering event [he] ha[s] ever experienced.” Id. ¶¶ 9, 12.\n\n       Jonathan Janis was 23 years old when his father was murdered. Jonathan, like his siblings,\n\nenjoyed a close and loving relationship with Tom. Pls.’ Ex.

In addition to growing up with his father’s\n\nhelp on homework and presence at school events, Jonathan enjoyed regular phone calls with his\n\nfather as an adult. See id. ¶¶ 3–4. On their last Sunday phone call, Tom and Jonathan discussed\n\ntheir plans to have Tom and Judith visit Jonathan in Florida “for a Valentines week mini-vacation.”\n\nId. ¶ 4. The news of Tom’s plane having gone down was “unfathomable” to Jonathan, who told\n\nhimself his father had to be fine because they had already booked hotel reservations and theme\n\npark tickets for the upcoming trip. See id. ¶ 5. Two days later, Jonathan learned from a resident\n\nassistant at Walt Disney World, where he was interning, that his father had been shot in the head\n\nand killed. Id. ¶ 6. During his father’s funeral, Jonathan held his mother while she wept. Id.\n\nJonathan thinks of his father every day, and his grief and loss continues 13 years later. Id. ¶ 7.\n\nHolidays—Thanksgiving, in particular—are difficult for Jonathan. See id. ¶ 4. For two years, he\n\nkept his father’s cell phone number programmed in his cell phone, unwilling to delete the entry.\n\nId. ¶ 7. Jonathan wears his father’s “watch and wedding band as a daily reminder” and is sad that\n\nhe “no longer ha[s] [his] sounding board.” In particular, he misses his father’s “motivational talks\n\nand tenderness.” Id. Jonathan wishes his future children could have known their grandfather. See\n\nid. At one point in time, Tom and Jonathan had “toyed with the notion of a frame shop where\n\n[Jonathan would] do the matting and [Tom would] make the frame,” which “will now never\n\nhappen.” Id. ¶ 7.\n\n       E.      Procedural History\n\n       Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against the Republic of Cuba under 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(c), a\n\nfederal statute that provides certain plaintiffs with a private cause of action against a foreign state\n\nwhose sponsorship of terrorism causes the plaintiff personal injury or death. Stansell, Gonsalves,\n\nand Howes seek damages for pain and suffering as a result of the acts of aircraft sabotage, hostage-\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\ftaking, and torture they endured at the hands of the FARC. Judith Janis and her children seek\n\nsolatium damages for the emotional trauma of losing their husband and father.\n\n         Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on September 17, 2015, and requested a summons be\n\nissued. See Compl.; Req. for Summons to Issue, ECF No. 5. After concluding service could not\n\nbe effected, Plaintiffs asked the Clerk of Court to mail by DHL Express one copy of the summons,\n\ncomplaint, and notice of suit, together with a translation of each into Spanish, to the Minister of\n\nForeign Affairs for the Republic of Cuba. See Aff. Req’g Foreign Mailing, ECF No. 6; Req. for\n\nClerk to Effect Service, ECF No. 9.\n\n         On September 22, 2015, Plaintiffs filed proof of service, reflecting that an individual in the\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs in Havana signed for the package sent by the Clerk of Court.\n\nSee Return of Serv., ECF No. 11. When Cuba failed to file an Answer to the Complaint within\n\n60 days, the Clerk of Court filed an entry of default. See Entry of Default as to the Republic of\n\nCuba, ECF. No. 13 (dated Dec. 9, 2015); 28 U.S.C. § 1608(d); Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). Plaintiffs\n\nthen filed the Motion for Default Judgment presently before the court. See Pls.’ Mot. for Default\n\nJ., ECF. No. 18. The court invited the United States to file a Statement of Interest, but it declined\n\nto do so. See Minute Order, dated June 20, 2016; Notice by United States of America, ECF No.\n\n20; Notice by United States of America, ECF No. 32.2\n\nII.      LEGAL STANDARD\n\n         The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grant district courts discretion to enter a default\n\njudgment upon a party’s motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). Entering a default judgment is not a\n\n\n\n2\n  Although the court originally anticipated holding an evidentiary hearing, Plaintiffs asked the court to vacate it,\nasserting that such a hearing was not legally required and that they had submitted sufficient evidence, as part of their\nmotion for default judgment, to satisfy their burden of proof. The court agreed to vacate the evidentiary hearing.\nSee Minute Order, dated Aug. 17, 2016; see also Bluth v. Islamic Republic of Iran, No. 12-cv-250, 2016 WL 4491760,\nat *10 (D.D.C. Aug. 25. 2016) (explaining that an evidentiary hearing is not required before a plaintiff may be awarded\nan entry of default judgment on a claim under the FSIA).\n\n                                                          15\n\ftask the courts take lightly, or one to which the moving party is automatically entitled.\n\nSee Thuneibat v. Syrian Arab Republic, 167 F. Supp. 3d 22, 32 (D.D.C. 2016). Instead, “default\n\njudgment must normally be viewed as available only when the adversary process has been halted\n\nbecause of an essentially unresponsive party,” Jackson v. Beech, 636 F.2d 831, 836 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1980) (internal quotation marks omitted), such as when one party “fail[s] to respond to the\n\nsummons and complaint, the entry of default, or the motion for default judgment,” United States\n\nv. TXL Mortg. Corp., No. 15-cv-1658, 2016 WL 5108019, at *1 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2016) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Importantly, even when an entry of default judgment may be available, it is only warranted\n\nwhere the plaintiff satisfies his burden of proving the court has jurisdiction over the claims and the\n\ndefendant and “establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.”\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1608(e); Thuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 33. The FSIA does not specify what kinds of\n\nevidence the plaintiff must submit to meet this evidentiary burden; it “leaves it to the court to\n\ndetermine precisely how much and what kinds of evidence the plaintiff must provide.” Han Kim\n\nv. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 774 F.3d 1044, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 2014). The court must\n\nthoroughly review the plaintiff’s allegations and the factual evidence presented, Bluth v. Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, No. 12-cv-250, 2016 WL 4491760, at *10 (D.D.C. Aug. 25, 2016), rather than\n\n“unquestioningly accept a complaint’s unsupported allegations as true,” Reed v. Islamic Republic\n\nof Iran, 845 F. Supp. 2d 204, 211 (D.D.C. 2012). However, “[u]ncontroverted factual allegations\n\nthat are supported by admissible evidence are taken as true,” Thuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 33.\n\n       Therefore, an entry of default judgment is available and warranted when (1) the court has\n\nsubject matter over the claims presented; (2) the court has personal jurisdiction over the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fdefendants; and the plaintiff presents sufficient evidence to satisfy the court (3) that she is entitled\n\nto relief against the defendant (4) for the amount of damages requested. Id.\n\nIII.    DISCUSSION\n\n        A.      Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n        This court has original jurisdiction to hear suits brought against foreign states, irrespective\n\nof the amount in controversy, if the case is a nonjury civil action for in personam relief and the\n\nforeign state is not entitled to immunity under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1605–1607. See 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).\n\nAs a general matter, the FSIA insulates foreign states from being sued in American courts.\n\nHowever, § 1605A—colloquially known as the “terrorism exception”—abrogates a foreign state’s\n\nsovereign immunity when the foreign state either perpetrated or provided material support or\n\nresources for particular acts of terrorism resulting in personal injury or death. See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1605A(a)(1). A plaintiff relying upon this statutory provision to abrogate sovereign immunity\n\nand, thus, establish subject matter jurisdiction, must prove four elements:\n\n                (1) the foreign country was designated a state-sponsor of terrorism\n                at the time of the act, (2) the claimant or the victim was a national\n                of the United States at that time; (3) in a case in which the act\n                occurred in the foreign state against which the claim has been\n                brought, the claimant has afforded the foreign state a reasonable\n                opportunity to arbitrate the claim; and (4) the plaintiff seeks\n                monetary damages for personal injury or death caused by torture,\n                extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the\n                provision of material support or resources for such an act, if engaged\n                in by an official, employee, or agent of a foreign country.\n\nThuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 34 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Here, Plaintiffs bring this civil suit against Cuba for in personam relief and do not request\n\na jury trial. Compl. ¶ 1. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims provided\n\nCuba cannot claim sovereign immunity. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1); Thuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d\n\nat 34. The court concludes that Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence that Cuba’s sovereign\n\n                                                  17\n\fimmunity is abrogated by the FSIA terrorism exception and no other limitation bars the court from\n\nexercising subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n         Cuba was first designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1982, and the United States\n\ncontinuously maintained Cuba’s status on that list until May 29, 2015.3 Therefore, Cuba was a\n\nstate sponsor of terrorism for the entire period during which the FARC’s terrorist acts against\n\nPlaintiffs occurred—February 13, 2003, to July 2, 2008.

However, the United States’ reconciliation with\nCuba was a widely publicized event, the date of which is well known in the general population. See, e.g., Julie\nHirschfeld Davis, U.S. Removes Cuba From State-Sponsored Terrorism List, N.Y.

J. (May 29, 2015), http://www.wsj.com/articles/cuba-\nofficially-removed-from-u-s-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-list-1432913160.\n     Accordingly, the court takes judicial notice of the fact that the United States took Cuba off its list of state sponsors\nof terrorism on May 29, 2015. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b), (c).\n\n                                                            18\n\f        Additionally, all Plaintiffs in this action—both the victims and the claimants—are\n\nAmerican citizens. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I); Stansell Aff. ¶ 1; Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 1;\n\nHowes Aff. ¶ 2; Jud. Janis Aff. ¶ 2; C. Janis Aff. ¶ 1; M. Janis Aff. ¶ 1; G. Janis Aff. ¶ 3; Jon. Janis\n\nAff. ¶ 1.\n\n        Section 1605A(c)’s third requirement—that the defendant nation be provided an\n\nopportunity to arbitrate—does not apply here, as the acts of terrorism at issue did not occur in\n\nCuba. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n        Lastly, Plaintiffs also presented satisfactory evidence to establish that their damages arise\n\nfrom Cuba’s provision of material support and resources to the FARC, which committed aircraft\n\nsabotage, the extrajudicial killing of Janis, and the hostage-taking and torture of Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes. See id. § 1605A(a)(1).\n\n        Under the FSIA, “aircraft sabotage” involves, in relevant part, “destroy[ing] an aircraft in\n\nservice or caus[ing] damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight.” Id.\n\n§ 1605A(h)(1); Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil\n\nAviation, art. I, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 565, 1973 WL 151803. The evidence Plaintiffs proffer\n\nreflects that members of the FARC shot at Plaintiffs’ aircraft while it was in flight, causing it to\n\ncrash-land. See Cote Aff. ¶¶ 20, 44, 45(a)–(b); Stansell Aff. ¶ 2; Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 2; Howes Aff.\n\n¶ 2. These facts meet the definition of “aircraft sabotage” under § 1605A.\n\n        The evidence presented also satisfactorily shows that Tom Janis was the victim of an\n\nextrajudicial killing, and Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were the victims of torture.              An\n\n“extrajudicial killing” is a “deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced\n\nby a regularly constituted court,” and an act of “torture” is “any act directed against an individual\n\nin the offender’s custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering[,] . . . is\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fintentionally inflicted . . . for such purposes as obtaining . . . information or a confession, punishing\n\nthat individual for an act that individual . . . has committed or is suspected of having committed,\n\nintimidating or coercing that individual, . . . or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.”\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1605A(h)(7); Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-256, § 3, 106\n\nStat. 73 (1992). Janis’s execution in the jungle was not sanctioned by any court and plainly\n\nconstitutes an “extrajudicial killing” within the meaning of the FSIA. See Jud. Janis Aff. ¶ 17;\n\nStansell Aff. ¶ 10; Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 9; Howes Aff. ¶ 10; Cote Aff. ¶ 45(c); Stmt. of Offense ¶ 8.\n\nSimilarly, the evidence reflects that the FARC “tortured” Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes within\n\nthe meaning of the FSIA by targeting them as Americans and, while holding them hostage, denying\n\nthem food and necessary medical attention; forcing them to march for long periods while suffering\n\nillness and injury; confining them to a barbed wire cage for months; forcing them to breathe heavy\n\ngasoline fumes as a form of punishment; chaining them to one another and trees; preventing them\n\nfrom communicating for months at a time; repeatedly threatening them with death; performing\n\nmock executions; and preventing them from performing basic bodily functions with decency and\n\nprivacy in order to humiliate and degrade them. See Stansell Aff. ¶¶ 3–6; Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 3–4;\n\nHowes Aff. ¶¶ 3–4.\n\n        Additionally, Plaintiffs’ evidence shows Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were taken\n\nhostage within the meaning of the FSIA. “Hostage taking” is defined by federal and international\n\nlaw to mean “seiz[ing] or detain[ing] and threaten[ing] to kill, to injure, or to continue to detain\n\nanother . . . in order to compel a third party, namely, a State, . . . to do or abstain from doing any\n\nact as an explicit or implicit condition [of the hostage’s] . . . release.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(h)(2);\n\nInternational Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, art. I, T.I.A.S. No. 11081, 1983 WL\n\n144724. The FARC’s acts of surrounding the downed aircraft, detaining its passengers, and\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\fseparating and forcibly holding Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes against their will for 1,967 days\n\nin order to leverage concessions from the Colombian and United States governments\n\nunquestionably constitutes “hostage-taking” under the FSIA. See Stmt. of Offense ¶ 16(e);\n\nStansell Aff. ¶¶ 2–3; Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 2–3; Howes Aff. ¶¶ 2–3.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs’ evidence proves to this court’s satisfaction that Cuba provided material\n\nsupport and resources in furtherance of the FARC’s actions. “Material support or resources”\n\nincludes the provision of “any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or\n\nmonetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or\n\nassistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment,\n\nfacilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel . . . , and transportation, except\n\nmedicine or religious materials.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(h)(3); 18 U.S.C. § 2339A. Plaintiffs’\n\nevidence shows that Cuba had a relationship with the FARC not only at the time the FARC shot\n\ndown Plaintiff’s aircraft, but also throughout the time the FARC held Stansell, Gonsalves, and\n\nHowes captive. At all times relevant to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the Cuban government provided,\n\ninter alia, safe haven for FARC members, political and military support for the FARC’s trafficking\n\nof cocaine through Venezuela, weapons, financial support, military training, and expert advice on\n\nthe production and trade of illicit drugs. Cuba also facilitated FARC members’ travel through\n\nVenezuela and Cuba. See Roig Decl. at 14–16, 19–20, 23–25; Cote Aff. ¶¶ 7–8, 16, 23(f), 28–35,\n\n43; Patterns of Global Terrorism 2003 at 3; Country Reports on Terrorism 2004 at 3; Country\n\nReports on Terrorism 2005 at 7; Country Reports on Terrorism 2006; Country Reports on\n\nTerrorism 2007 at 3; Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 at 4–5. This material support enabled\n\nthe FARC to commit international acts of terrorism, including, but not limited to, facilitating their\n\ntargeting of Americans; attacking the aircraft carrying Stansell, Gonsalves, Howes, and Janis;\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fkilling Janis and holding Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes hostage; moving the hostages throughout\n\nthe jungle to avoid detection; guarding the hostages under threat of death; and keeping the hostages\n\ncaptive for more than five years. See Cote Aff. ¶¶ 45–46, 49; Roig Decl. at 24–25.\n\n       The court also acknowledges that this action is timely. Plaintiffs filed suit on September\n\n17, 2015, which is within the six-month window after Cuba was relieved of its designation as a\n\nstate sponsor of terrorism. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)(2)(A)(I)(i). Plaintiffs’ suit also is within 10\n\nyears of the victims’ rescue on July 2, 2008. See id. § 1605A(b)(2).\n\n       Thus, the court is satisfied that it may exercise its subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n       B.      Personal Jurisdiction\n\n       Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state exists if service is made pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1608. See 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b). Section 1608 provides four means of effecting service on a\n\nforeign state: (1) “by special arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the foreign state or\n\npolitical subdivision”; (2) “in accordance with an applicable international convention on service\n\nof judicial documents”; (3) if neither of the first two options is available, then by “sending a copy\n\nof the summons and complaint and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each into the\n\nofficial language of the foreign state, by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be\n\naddressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of\n\nthe foreign state concerned”; or (4) if the third option cannot effect service within thirty days, then\n\nby requesting that the clerk of the court send two copies of the aforementioned materials to “the\n\nSecretary of State in Washington, District of Columbia, to the attention of the Director of Special\n\nConsular Services,” whereupon the Secretary will then send one copy of the papers “through\n\ndiplomatic channels to the foreign state and shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of\n\nthe diplomatic notice indicating when the papers were transmitted.” 28 U.S.C. § 1608(a).\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f       Plaintiffs properly effected service on October 6, 2015, when they filed with the court proof\n\nthat the Complaint, Summons, and Notice of Suit, together with a copy of each in Spanish, were\n\nserved on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and signed for in Havana. See Certificate of Mailing,\n\nECF No. 10; Return of Service/Aff., ECF No. 11. Service in accordance with § 1608(a)(3) was\n\nappropriate because, at the time Plaintiffs commenced suit, Cuba had neither a special arrangement\n\nfor service with Plaintiffs nor entered into an international convention governing service. See Pls.’\n\nReq. for Clerk to Effect Service, ECF No. 9. Accordingly, Plaintiffs established that service was\n\nproperly effected and the court is satisfied that it has personal jurisdiction over Cuba.\n\n       C.      Cuba’s Liability to Plaintiffs\n\n       Section 1605A(c) offers certain plaintiffs a federal cause of action against a foreign state\n\nthat perpetrated or provided material support for an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, hostage\n\ntaking, or aircraft sabotage, resulting in the plaintiff’s personal injury or death.        28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1605A(c). This cause of action has five elements: (1) “an act of torture, extrajudicial killing,\n\naircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act”;\n\n(2) committed or materially supported by the defendant foreign state or an official, employee, or\n\nagent of the defendant foreign state; (3) that “caused”; (4) “personal injury or death”; (5) “for\n\nwhich courts of the United States may maintain jurisdiction under this section for money\n\ndamages.” Id. §§ 1605A(a)(1), (c). Additionally, the plaintiff must be an American citizen, a\n\nmember of the armed forces, a government employee or individual performing a government\n\ncontract and acting within the scope of that employment, or a legal representative thereof. Id.\n\n§ 1605A(c). Lastly, the defendant foreign state has to be, have been at the time of the attack, or\n\nhave been so designated as a result of the attack, a state sponsor of terrorism.                   Id.\n\n§§ 1605A(a)(2)(A)(i), (c).\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f        Although the statute sets out the private cause of action, it offers no substantive guidance\n\nas to what will satisfy the causation and injury elements of that cause of action. As a result, courts\n\nrely on “generalized principles of tort law” to determine whether the defendant is legally\n\nresponsible for the plaintiff’s harm. See Thuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 38; cf. Bettis v. Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, 315 F.3d 325, 333 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that, in FSIA state-sponsored\n\nterrorism exception cases, the federal courts must apply traditional tort principles from the\n\nRestatement and existing state law, rather than develop federal common law).\n\n        It is not enough for plaintiffs to “simply alleg[e] that an act ‘caused harm.’” Rimkus v.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran, 750 F. Supp. 2d 163, 175 (D.D.C. 2010). Instead, § 1605A(c) requires\n\nthat plaintiffs establish causation not only as a matter of fact, but also as a matter of law. Id.\n\nTherefore, plaintiffs seeking to recover damages under § 1605A(c) “must articulate the\n\njustification for . . . recovery, generally through the lens of civil tort liability.” Id. at 176. In other\n\nwords, plaintiffs must identify a particular theory of tort liability—e.g., intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress, wrongful death, battery—to properly raise a claim under § 1605A(c).\n\n                1.      The Direct Victims—Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes\n\n        Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were American citizens at the time of the February 13,\n\n2003, attack, and, as explained previously, Cuba was designated a state sponsor of terrorism for\n\nthe entire period during which Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were held hostage and tortured.\n\n        In addition, the court has already concluded that Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes suffered\n\nacts of aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, and torture—as those terms are understood under the\n\nFSIA—at the hands of the FARC, and the record evidence demonstrates that Cuba provided\n\nmaterial support to the FARC. Lastly, the court has determined it has jurisdiction over this matter\n\n\n\n\n                                                    24\n\fand Plaintiffs seek only monetary compensation. See supra III.A. Therefore, the first, second,\n\nand fifth elements of § 1605A(c) are satisfied.\n\n       With respect to causation and injury, Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes specified no\n\nparticular theory of relief to justify their receipt of damages—instead, each plaintiff seeks\n\ncompensation for “the 1,967 days of captivity as a hostage and for his physical and mental torture\n\nduring captivity, including past and future physical and mental pain and suffering, disability,\n\ndisfigurement, permanent injuries, and lost enjoyment of life.” See Compl. (concluding prayer for\n\nrelief). This type of pleading is a “caused harm” pleading—for which this court has admonished\n\nplaintiffs. See Rimkus, 750 F. Supp. 3d at 175, 183 (explaining that plaintiff failed to plead a\n\ntheory of relief when he alleged only that his son died and defendants were responsible for his\n\nson’s death).\n\n       Nonetheless, courts in this District previously have allowed a plaintiff’s FSIA claim to\n\nproceed, even absent a clearly articulated theory of recovery, when the plaintiff alleged all the facts\n\nnecessary to establish the elements of § 1605A(c). See, e.g., id. at 176, 181–82; Valencia v. Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, 774 F. Supp. 2d 1, 12–13 (D.D.C. 2010); cf. Oveissi v. Islamic Republic of Iran,\n\n879 F. Supp. 2d 44, 52 (D.D.C. 2012). Here, the court is presented with all the facts necessary to\n\nestablish causation and injury and, therefore, “will not exalt form over substance” to preclude\n\nrelief. See Rimkus, 750 F. Supp. 2d at 176. Instead, the court will look to state decisional law,\n\nlegal treatises, and the Restatements to identify an applicable theory of recovery in concert with\n\nthe evidence presented. See id. at 183–84; Valencia, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 12–13.\n\n       The language Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes use in their Complaint and the evidence\n\nbefore the court largely align with the quintessential common law torts of battery (aircraft sabotage\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fand physical torture); false imprisonment (hostage taking); and assault and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress (mental and emotional harm). Cf. Valencia, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 13.\n\n       With respect to the acts of aircraft sabotage and physical torture, Stansell, Gonsalves, and\n\nHowes may recover under a theory of battery. Battery occurs when one person (1) “acts intending\n\nto cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other . . . or an imminent\n\napprehension of such a contact, and (2) a harmful contact with the person of the other directly or\n\nindirectly results.” See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 13; Valencia, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 13;\n\nSutherland v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 151 F. Supp. 2d 27, 48 (D.D.C. 2001) (describing physical\n\ntorture as an extreme form of battery). “Harmful contact” is that which causes “any physical\n\nimpairment of the condition of another’s body, or physical pain or illness,” see RESTATEMENT\n\n(SECOND) OF TORTS § 15, and can be caused by contacting either another’s person directly or an\n\ninstrumentality that acts as an extension of the individual’s person, such as a car or airplane in\n\nwhich the individual is traveling, see id. § 18 cmt. c & Rptr.’s Notes.\n\n       Here, a battery occurred both when the FARC shot down the airplane and when the\n\nterrorists subsequently tortured their hostages. The FARC’s act of shooting down a moving\n\naircraft was an intentional harmful contact to those onboard. Similarly, the acts of physical\n\ntorture—e.g., chaining the hostages to one another and to trees, forcing them to breathe gasoline\n\nfumes, imposing unwanted medical treatment on them—were direct, intentional, harmful contacts.\n\nThe hostages suffered physical injuries from the plane crash, disfigurement from the chains, and\n\ncontinue to suffer from the effects of the FARC’s forced medical treatments. See supra I.D.\n\n       In light of the evidence presented, the court has little trouble concluding that Cuba provided\n\nthe FARC with the materials, training, and resources necessary to carry out these batteries—the\n\naircraft sabotage and physical torture—and that it did so with intent to harm these plaintiffs. Cuba\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fintentionally provided support to the FARC over a number of years and encouraged the FARC to\n\nuse violence to promote its political agenda. That provision of support and encouragement\n\nfacilitated the acts perpetrated against Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes. See Cote Aff. ¶¶ 27–28,\n\n32; Roig Decl. at 24. Cuba’s support allowed for “[s]ophisticated communications between FARC\n\nFronts tracking the aircraft and seeking permission to shoot it down”; the shooting down of the\n\nplane; “move[ment] of the U.S. hostages repeatedly over 5 years and . . . maint[enance] of\n\nstructures in the jungle for their imprisonment and torture”; and “the necessary logistic[al] support\n\nin order to keep the hostages captive.” Cote Aff. ¶ 45; see id. ¶¶ 29, 31, 38. Thus, Cuba is\n\nresponsible, under a theory of battery, for the injuries Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes sustained\n\nfrom the FARC sabotaging their aircraft and torturing them.\n\n       Cuba may be held liable under the theory of false imprisonment for the FARC’s acts of\n\nhostage taking. Under general principles of tort law, a plaintiff may recover for false imprisonment\n\nwhen one person “(a) acts intending to confine the other . . . within boundaries fixed by the actor,\n\nand (b) his act directly or indirectly results in such a confinement of the other, and (c) the other is\n\nconscious of the confinement or is harmed by it.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 35. It is\n\nindisputable that Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were held against their will for 1,967 days, and\n\nPlaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for this court to conclude that Cuba’s provision of material\n\nsupport to the FARC allowed the terrorists not only to organize the act of aircraft sabotage, but\n\nalso to take and hold captive the three Americans. See Cote Aff. ¶ 45; Roig Decl. at 24; Levin v.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran, 529 F. Supp. 2d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2007). Accordingly, the court concludes\n\nCuba is liable to Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes, under principles of false imprisonment, for the\n\npain and suffering they endured as a result of the conditions of their confinement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f       In addition, Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes may recover under a theory of assault for the\n\nmental torture they endured at the hands of the FARC. An assault occurs when one person (a) “acts\n\nintending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other . . ., or an imminent\n\napprehension of such a contact, and (b) the other is thereby put in such imminent apprehension.”\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND)       OF   TORTS § 21. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes suffered imminent\n\napprehension of death when the FARC tortured them with mock executions and visible\n\npreparations to kill them each time a helicopter flew nearby. Cuba may be held liable under the\n\ncommon law tort principles of assault for the mental harms Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes\n\nsuffered because it provided material support to the FARC’s activities. See supra I.B, I.D.1.\n\n       Lastly, these plaintiffs may also recover under a theory of intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress for the emotional trauma they endured. A defendant is liable for intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress when he, “by extreme and outrageous conduct[,] intentionally or\n\nrecklessly causes severe emotional distress to” the plaintiff. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §\n\n46. Terrorist acts themselves are intentional acts, aimed to cause severe emotional distress. See\n\nLevin, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 17. “Moreover, the act of engaging in terrorism by means of material\n\nsupport . . . is extreme, outrageous, and goes beyond all possible bounds of decency.” Id. Cuba’s\n\nprovision of material support to the FARC, which allowed for the attack on February 13, 2003,\n\nand hostage-taking, is extreme and outrageous conduct that intentionally caused Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes severe emotional distress. These plaintiffs suffered extreme emotional\n\nanguish when forcibly marched through the jungle, denied medical care, refused communication\n\nwith their loved ones, kept in cages, chained to trees and one another, prevented from performing\n\nbasic bodily functions and needs, mock executed, and regularly being told they would be killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fSee supra I.B, I.D.1. Cuba is liable for these harms as a result of directly financing, training, and\n\notherwise providing material support to the FARC.\n\n       In sum, Cuba is liable to Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes for the harm caused them by the\n\nFARC’s acts of sabotaging their aircraft, taking and holding them hostage for 1,967 days, and\n\nphysically and psychologically torturing them during their captivity.\n\n               2.       The Indirect Victims—Judith Janis and the Janis Children\n\n       Judith Janis and her four children seek damages against Cuba for their “past and future loss\n\nof solatium, mental anguish, bereavement, grief, loss of spousal [and parental] society, comfort,\n\naffections, and guidance.” See Compl. (closing prayer for relief). They are American citizen-\n\nclaimants who seek monetary relief for the extrajudicial killing of their husband and father, Tom\n\nJanis, at the hands of the FARC, which received material support and resources from Cuba.\n\nSee supra III.A. Therefore, the first, second, and fifth elements of their cause of action are\n\nsatisfied. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(A)(c). Thus, the court focuses its discussion on the elements of\n\ncausation and injury.\n\n       Claims for solatium under the FSIA are nearly indistinguishable from claims for intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress. See Flanagan v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 87 F. Supp. 3d 93, 115\n\n(D.D.C. 2015); Belkin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 667 F. Supp. 3d 8, 22 (D.D.C. 2009). The same\n\nframework outlined above applies, see supra III.C.1, and plaintiffs who are not the direct victim\n\nof the “extreme and outrageous conduct” may still recover under § 1605A(C) “if they are members\n\nof the [v]ictim’s immediate family and the defendants’ conduct is sufficiently outrageous and\n\nintended to inflict severe emotional harm upon a person who is not present.” Thuneibat, 167 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f       Judith, Christopher, Greer, Michael, and Jonathan have presented sufficient evidence to\n\nsatisfy all the elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. They are the\n\nwidow and children of Tom Janis, and thus qualify as “members of the [v]ictim’s immediate\n\nfamily.” See id. Moreover, as just discussed, Cuba’s provision of material support and resources\n\nto the FARC—who had previously committed acts of terrorism—was sufficiently outrageous and\n\nextreme that the Janis family members did not have to be present to suffer severe emotional harm.\n\nTheir declarations make clear that each family member suffered an immense loss with the death\n\nof Tom Janis, and Cuba’s support enabled the FARC to perpetrate the acts that caused their severe\n\nemotional distress.\n\n       Judith lost her husband of more than 30 years—“the love of [her] life”—and spent years\n\nafter his death investigating what happened in his final moments and who murdered him. She\n\ncontinues to grieve daily and has no intention of remarrying. Jud. Janis Aff. ¶¶ 8, 16, 17, 19.\n\n       All four children enjoyed a close and loving relationship with their father. C.

Christopher was told of his father’s\n\nplane crash while deployed overseas, flew home immediately, and while in the Atlanta airport\n\nlearned his father had been killed. He is saddened that he will never be able to talk to his father\n\nabout their shared experiences serving in the military and feels his accomplishments are less\n\nrewarding without being able to share them with his father. C. Janis Aff. ¶¶ 10–11.\n\n       Every Father’s Day, Michael Janis goes through a box of his father’s belongings.

G. Janis Aff. ¶ 6. She had traveled\n\nhome often to visit because of the close relationship she had with her father; Tom was “an intrinsic\n\npart of [Greer’s] life” and his death “made a hole in [her] life.” Id. ¶ 9.\n\n           Jonathan, the youngest child, wears his father’s “watch and wedding band as a daily\n\nreminder” of his loss. Jon. Janis Aff. ¶ 7. He is sad that he “no longer ha[s] [his] sounding board.”\n\nId. During his father’s funeral, Jonathan held his mother while she wept. Id. ¶ 6. For two years,\n\nhe kept his father’s cell phone number programmed in his cell phone, unwilling to delete the entry.\n\nId. ¶ 7.\n\n           Thus, the members of the Janis family provided satisfactory evidence that Cuba is liable to\n\nthem under § 1605A(c) for the severe emotional distress caused by the February 13, 2003, attack\n\nand extrajudicial killing of their husband and father, Tom Janis.\n\n           D.     Damages\n\n           The purpose of § 1605A(c) is to allow victims of state-sponsored terrorism to hold liable\n\ncountries that support terrorist groups for the consequences flowing from that support. Thus, the\n\nplain text of the FSIA allows plaintiffs to pursue “economic damages, solatium, pain and suffering,\n\nand punitive damages.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(c). To be awarded damages under this provision, the\n\nplaintiff “must prove that the consequences of the foreign state’s conduct were reasonably certain\n\n(i.e., more likely than not) to occur, and must prove the amount of damages by a reasonable\n\nestimate consistent with this Circuit’s application of the American rule on damages.” Thuneibat,\n\n\n\n                                                   31\n\f167 F. Supp. 3d at 47–48 (alteration adopted and internal quotation marks omitted). Expert\n\ntestimony and prior awards of damages in comparable FSIA cases inform the court’s determination\n\nof what constitutes a “reasonable estimate.” Id. at 48.\n\n       Here, Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that Tom Janis’s death, the harm caused\n\nStansell, Gonsalves, and Howes as hostages, and the ongoing pain and suffering of the former\n\nhostages and grieving Janis family members were reasonably certain and actually intended\n\nconsequences of Cuba’s material support of the FARC. Cuba knowingly encouraged, supplied,\n\nsheltered, and provided weapons and military training to these terrorists, who specifically targeted\n\nAmerican citizens for their attacks.

In addition, Cuba utilized its close relationship with the Venezuelan government to facilitate\n\nthe FARC’s distribution of cocaine and safe travel along the Colombian-Venezuelan border,\n\nallowing the FARC to participate in international drug trafficking and evade efforts to thwart their\n\noperations, including recovery of the hostages. Roig Decl. at 16–17; see Cote Aff. ¶ 47. By\n\nsupporting the FARC in this way, Cuba made the acts of terrorism at issue in this case and the pain\n\nand suffering they caused reasonably certain to occur. Thus, Plaintiffs have shown that they are\n\nentitled to an award of damages.\n\n       Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes seek compensation for their pain and suffering, while\n\nJudith and the Janis children seek solatium damages for the emotional trauma of losing their\n\nhusband and father. While quantifying these types of harms is inherently difficult, the court’s\n\n“primary consideration is to ensure that individuals with similar injuries receive similar rewards.”\n\nMoradi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 77 F. Supp. 57, 70 (D.D.C. 2015) (internal quotation mark\n\nomitted); accord id. at 72.\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f       In hostage-taking cases, this court typically relies upon a per diem calculation to award\n\ncompensatory damages. Under this framework, victims receive $10,000 for each day they were\n\nheld captive and may be awarded an additional lump sum if the per diem award amount fails to\n\naccount for their pain and suffering. See, e.g., Wyatt v. Syrian Arab Republic, 908 F. Supp. 2d\n\n216, 231 (D.D.C. 2012); Massie v. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 592 F. Supp. 2d 57,\n\n77 (D.D.C. 2008); Levin, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 20–21; Price v. Socialist People’s Libyan Arab\n\nJamahiriya, 384 F. Supp. 2d 120, 134–36 (D.D.C. 2005).\n\n       Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes ask the court to follow the per diem approach and consider\n\nan additional lump sum award to account for their extreme treatment during the more than five\n\nyears they were held hostage. The court concludes that framework is appropriate. Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes were held captive for 1,967 days, for which the court will award each victim\n\n$19,670,000. As in other FSIA cases, however, this base award falls short of compensating the\n\nhostage victims for the full extent of their injuries. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes suffered\n\nextreme physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of the FARC, made possible by Cuba’s\n\nprovision of material support for the FARC’s activities. The hostages survived a plane crash only\n\nto be subjected to long marches, weighed down by chains, denied medical treatment, starved, and\n\nexposed to and forced to suffer from serious illnesses—some of which are permanent. In addition,\n\nthey lived in constant fear of death, far away from home and without contact from their loved ones,\n\nand under conditions that continue to haunt them today. This extreme suffering justifies an award\n\ngreater than the per diem calculation.\n\n       Rather than submit a specific lump sum request to the court, Plaintiffs simply ask for an\n\namount that is “fair and reasonable” under the case law. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes have\n\nsuffered, and will continue to suffer, life-long pain and suffering as a result of the FARC’s acts.\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fThe court concludes that the extent of the men’s injuries warrants an additional payment of\n\n$25,000,000 each. This award aligns with lump sum awards in other cases involving extreme\n\ncircumstances of hostage-taking. The amount of the award accounts for the length of time Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes were held hostage—which far exceeds the periods of captivity of plaintiffs\n\nin other FSIA cases decided in this District—the violent shooting down of their aircraft, the\n\nextremity of their treatment in the jungle, and the ongoing physical, psychological, and emotional\n\neffects of their experience. Cf., e.g., Wyatt, 908 F. Supp. 2d at 232 (awarding per diem amount of\n\n$210,000 for 21 days in captivity, plus $5,000,000 lump sum for pain and suffering); Massie, 592\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 77 (awarding per diem amount of $3,350,000 for 335 days in captivity, plus\n\n$13,400,000 lump sum for pain and suffering); Price, 384 F. Supp. 2d at 134–36 (awarding per\n\ndiem amount of $1,050,000 for 105 days in captivity, plus $7,500,000 lump sum for pain and\n\nsuffering).\n\n       Courts also developed a framework for awarding solatium damages to spouses and\n\nimmediate family members of those harmed by acts of state-sponsored terrorism. As a general\n\nmatter, “courts typically award between $8 million and $12 million for pain and suffering resulting\n\nfrom the death of a spouse.” Flanagan, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 117. In calculating awards for the loss\n\nof other family members, courts consider a variety of factors, including:\n\n               (1) whether the decedent’s death was sudden and unexpected;\n               (2) whether the death was attributable to negligence or malice;\n               (3) whether the claimants have sought medical treatment for\n               depression and related disorders resulting from the decedent’s death;\n               (4) the nature (i.e., closeness) of the relationship between the\n               claimant and the decedent; and (5) the duration of the claimants’\n               mental anguish in excess of that which would have been experienced\n               following the decedent’s natural death.\n\nStethem v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 89–90 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\f       The death of a spouse is undoubtedly one of the worst experiences in a person’s life, only\n\nmade more terrible by knowing the loved one’s life ended at the hands of violent terrorists. Judith\n\nJanis had an unquestionably close relationship with her husband Tom, as evidenced by more than\n\n30 years of marriage and a deep commitment to never spend more than 10 days apart. The pain\n\nand suffering she has experienced were magnified by the initial lack of information surrounding\n\nhis death: she learned her husband had gone missing over a voicemail; only determined he had\n\nbeen killed days later; and worked for years with the FBI to learn exactly what happened to her\n\nhusband. In light of these circumstances, the court awards Judith Janis $12,000,000 in solatium\n\ndamages. See Belkin, 667 F. Supp. 2d at 23 (collecting cases with similar awards); Valore, 700 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 85–86 (s).\n\n       The Janis children suffered a profound loss when the FARC murdered their father, the\n\nemotional effects of which remain ongoing. There is no question on this record whether Tom Janis\n\nhad a close and loving relationship with each of his children. Christopher, Greer, Michael, and\n\nJonathan each shared a special bond with their father and continue to mourn his death more than a\n\ndecade later. Tom Janis’s death was, indeed, sudden and unexpected—he was young, in good\n\nphysical shape, and had plans to visit his youngest son, Jonathan, in Florida. The children’s\n\nanguish at their father’s death was only exacerbated by the lack of information available; indeed,\n\nnone of the Janis children knew the full details of what happened to their father until Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes returned more than five years later. Moreover, the court does not doubt\n\nthat the manner of Tom Janis’s death—successfully crash-landing a plane under fire only to be\n\ntaken hostage and, some excruciating hours later, shot execution-style—adds to their pain and\n\nsuffering. Particular holidays and places perpetually remind the Janis children of the loss of not\n\nonly their father, but also the opportunity to share their lives with him. Their suffering has been\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fongoing and will continue for the rest of their adult lives. Thus, the court will award each of the\n\nJanis children $5,000,000 in solatium damages.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default Judgment.\n\nThe court enters judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and orders the Republic of Cuba to pay Keith\n\nStansell, Marc Gonsalves, and Thomas Howes $44,670,000 each in compensatory damages; Judith\n\nJanis $12,000,000 in solatium damages; and each of the Janis children $5,000,000 in solatium\n\ndamages.

Plaintiffs allege that Cuba provided material support to the Fuerzas Armadas\n\nRevolucionarias de Colombia, a designated foreign terrorist organization commonly known as “the\n\nFARC,” which made possible the FARC’s shooting down of their aircraft, extrajudicial killing of\n\nTom Janis, and the hostage-taking and torture of Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves, and Thomas\n\nHowes. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes seek money damages for the pain and suffering they\n\nendured during their 1,967 days of captivity. The widow and children of Tom Janis seek solatium\n\ndamages for the emotional trauma of losing their husband and father.\n\n         Cuba has never entered an appearance in this action. The Clerk of Court entered an order\n\nof default against Cuba, and Plaintiffs moved for an entry of default judgment. After thorough\n\nconsideration of the evidence and briefing presented, the court grants Plaintiffs’ motion.\n\fI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         The court begins with a summary of the factual background leading up to the terrorist acts\n\nat issue, a description of those acts, and the procedural history of this case. To do so, the court\n\ndraws upon the allegations in the Complaint, affidavits from Plaintiffs, the sworn testimony of two\n\nexpert witnesses, and the official Central Intelligence Agency and United States Department of\n\nState annual reports on state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide. Additionally, the court takes\n\njudicial notice of the Stipulated Statement of Offense entered in United States v. Herrera and\n\nincorporates that statement as part of its findings of fact.1 See Stip. Stmt. of Offense in Supp. of\n\nGuilty Plea, United States v. Herrera, No. 10-cr-339-15 (D.D.C. 2014), ECF No. 64 [hereinafter\n\nStmt. of Offense].\n\n         A.        Cuba’s State Sponsorship of Terrorism\n\n         The FARC is a designated foreign terrorist organization existing and operating primarily\n\nin the Republic of Colombia. See 8 U.S.C. § 1189(a)(1); Pls.’ Notice of Filing App’x Vol. I, ECF\n\nNo. 16 [hereinafter Pls.’ Ex. List I], U.S. DEP’T OF STATE, Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2001\n\n(May 2002), ECF No. 16-20, at 6. The group’s predominant goal is to overthrow the Colombian\n\ngovernment. Throughout its years of existence, the FARC has sought to destabilize the existing\n\ngovernment through acts of violence, including murders, hostage takings, and bombings. See\n\nStmt. of Offense ¶ 2; Pls.’ Ex. List I, U.S. DEP’T OF STATE, Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1997\n\n\n1\n  The court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion to Take Judicial Notice as to the Stipulated Statement of Offense entered in\nUnited States v. Herrera. See Pls.’ Mot. to Take Judicial Notice, ECF No. 25; Stip. Stmt. of Offense in Supp. of\nGuilty Plea, United States v. Herrera, No. 10-cr-339-15 (D.D.C. 2014), ECF No. 64. A court may take judicial notice\nof a fact not subject to reasonable dispute, either because it is “generally known” or can be “accurately and readily\ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). It is well\nestablished that a court may “take judicial notice of, and give effect to, its own records in another but interrelated\nproceeding,” Booth v. Fletcher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 679 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1938), and courts adjudicating FSIA claims often\nelect to do so, see e.g., Roth v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387 (D.D.C. 2015). In United States v.\nHerrera, this court oversaw the criminal prosecution of one of the terrorists responsible for the very acts of terrorism\nat issue here. Accordingly, that case is one “interrelated” to the present civil litigation and the court will take judicial\nnotice of the Stipulated Statement of Offense in making its findings of fact. See Roth, 78 F. Supp. 3d at 387.\n\n                                                             2\n\f(Apr. 1998), ECF No. 16-16, at 4; Decl. of Expert Witness Pedro Roig, ECF No. 15 [hereinafter\n\nRoig Decl.], at 12. In 1964, the FARC became inspired by the Cuban Revolution and sought\n\nassistance, advice, and support from the Cuban government. Aff. of Expert Witness Luis Miguel\n\nCote Gómez, ECF No. 14 [hereinafter Cote Aff.], ¶ 27.\n\n       Throughout the time period relevant to this lawsuit, Cuba was led by Fidel and Raul Castro.\n\nId. The Castro brothers exercised complete control over all matters of government, which made\n\nthem, in effect, the Cuban government. Id. Consequently, the brothers’ “decisions to provide\n\nsupport and resources to . . . the FARC and to destabilize democracies in Latin America were . . .\n\ndecisions made . . . [by] the Cuban government and state.” See id.; Roig Decl. at 5.\n\n       Cuba supported the FARC in a number of ways. For example, Cuba provided military,\n\nexplosives, and weapons training to FARC members in camps organized in Venezuela. Cote Aff.\n\n¶ 31; Roig Decl. at 24. Through their Cuban allies, the FARC also gained communications training\n\nand expertise in intelligence gathering techniques. See Cote Aff. ¶ 30. Havana served as a safe\n\nhaven for FARC members. Id. ¶ 28; Roig Decl. at 14–15. Additionally, through its relationship\n\nwith the Venezuelan government, Cuba facilitated the FARC’s ability to move across the\n\nColombian-Venezuelan border undetected, which made it easier not only for Cuban officials to\n\nprovide resources and advice to the FARC, but also for FARC members to access international\n\nflights, engage in drug trafficking, and evade international efforts to thwart their operations. Cote\n\nAff. ¶¶ 43, 47; Roig Decl. at 16, 19–20, 25.\n\n       B.      The Events of February 13, 2003, and Subsequent Years of Captivity and\n               Torture\n\n       On February 13, 2003, an aircraft performing a counter-narcotics surveillance flight over\n\nColombia on behalf of the United States Embassy came under fire from the FARC and experienced\n\nengine failure. On board were four American civilian contractors—Tom Janis, Keith Stansell,\n\n                                                 3\n\fMarc Gonsalves, and Thomas Howes—and one Colombian citizen, Luis Alcides Cruz. All five\n\npassengers survived the crash landing. Shortly thereafter, FARC members surrounded the aircraft\n\nand took the men hostage, separating Stansell, Howes, and Gonsalves from Janis and Cruz. The\n\nterrorists marched the first group of men into the jungle, where they would be held captive and\n\ntortured for more than five years. Janis and Cruz were shot, execution-style, and their bodies left\n\nnear the crash site. See Stmt. of Offense ¶¶ 6–7, 8–12, 15; Cote Aff. ¶¶ 20, 44, 45(a)–(b); Pls.’\n\nNotice of Filing App’x Vol. II, ECF No. 17 [hereinafter Pls.’ Ex. List II], Ex. 1, Aff. of Keith\n\nStansell, ECF No. 17-1 [hereinafter Stansell Aff.], ¶¶ 2, 10; Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 2, Aff. of Marc\n\nGonsalves, ECF No. 17-2 [hereinafter Gonsalves Aff.], ¶¶ 2, 9; Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 3, Aff. of\n\nThomas Howes, ECF No. 17-3 [hereinafter Howes Aff.], ¶¶ 2, 10.\n\n       Members of the FARC informed the hostages that their continued detention would increase\n\ninternational pressure and allow the FARC to leverage concessions from the Colombian\n\ngovernment in exchange for their release. Stmt. of Offense ¶ 10. In late July 2003, the FARC sent\n\na videotape of the hostages to media outlets in the United States to prove the hostages were still\n\nalive. On the video, the FARC demanded that, in exchange for the release of the American\n\nhostages, Colombia release all FARC members held in Colombian prisons and create a\n\ndemilitarized zone for the FARC. Id. ¶ 11.\n\n       During their time with the FARC, Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes experienced\n\nextraordinarily cruel and dehumanizing treatment. The terrorists forced their hostages to march\n\nfor miles in the jungle without the benefit of proper equipment or rest, going to great lengths to\n\nconceal their location and the hostages’ identities. The hostages lost substantial weight and the\n\npads on the balls of their feet were worn to the bone as a result of carrying heavy weight on their\n\nback while trekking miles each day in rugged terrain without proper footwear. Stansell Aff. ¶¶ 4(i),\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f5; Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 4(i), 5; Howes Aff. ¶¶ 4(i), 5. To control the hostages, the FARC used “choke\n\nharnesses, ropes, chains, padlocks, and wires to bind the [hostages’] necks and wrists.” Stmt. of\n\nOffense ¶ 15. The terrorists then chained the hostages to trees or one another for months or even\n\nyears at a time. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(vi), (x); Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(viii); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ix). The food\n\nthe hostages received was rotten, tainted with gasoline, and stored in containers previously used\n\nto store agricultural chemicals. Howes Aff. ¶ 11.\n\n       The hostages lived in traumatic and unsanitary conditions. The FARC kept the men in\n\ntight enclosures—such as wooden boxes or barbed wire cages—without toilet facilities of any\n\nkind. If one of the hostages needed to relieve himself, then he had to ask permission; the FARC\n\nmembers often humiliated him for asking or denied permission altogether. The men regularly\n\nwere forced to defecate where they were chained, causing the enclosures to become covered in\n\nfeces. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(xii); Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 4(vii)–(viii); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(iii).\n\n       Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes each suffered from a plethora of debilitating illnesses. For\n\nexample, on four different occasions, Howes suffered from fly larva growing under his skin that\n\nhad to be killed by cigarette nicotine and squeezed from his flesh. Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ii). The water\n\nand food the men received were dirty, causing them regular digestive problems. Gonsalves Aff. ¶\n\n4(ii); cf. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(i); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ii). More seriously, Gonsalves and Howes developed\n\na skin rotting disease called leishmaniasis. Despite having the medication with which to treat the\n\ninfection and seeing the men in great need, the FARC repeatedly denied them the medication.\n\nGonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(v); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ii), (v).\n\n       The medical attention the hostages did receive sometimes caused more harm than good.\n\nFor example, Stansell’s hip became infected as a result of receiving spoiled medicine, causing a\n\nbaseball-sized cyst to grow, rot, and burst. The FARC cut the cyst out of Stansell’s hip using a\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fscalpel, without any anesthetic or other pain medication. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(iv). Similarly, although\n\nGonsalves ultimately received the leishmaniasis medication, the FARC re-used needles for his\n\ntreatments, causing him to contract hepatitis. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(v). In an effort to treat the\n\nhepatitis, the FARC injected Gonsalves, against his will, with a variety of unknown drugs that\n\ncaused him additional pain and suffering. Id.\n\n        FARC members also regularly punished their hostages. Sometimes they added chains or\n\npadlocks to the already heavy chains the hostages wore. Howes Aff. ¶ 4(ix). They also starved\n\nthe hostages while subjecting them to exhausting marches through the jungle. Gonsalves Aff. ¶\n\n4(iv); Howes Aff. ¶ 4(iv). In one instance in particular, after a fellow hostage escaped, the FARC\n\npunished Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes by requiring them to stand in a small space filled with\n\nlarge drums of gasoline and sealed off by thick gauge black plastic, forcing them to inhale the\n\ngasoline fumes. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(viii).\n\n        In addition to harming the hostages physically, the terrorists also inflicted extreme mental\n\npain and suffering. They forced Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes into solitary confinement and\n\nprohibited them from speaking with anyone for months on end, causing the men to grow hoarse\n\nfrom not using their vocal chords. Stansell Aff. ¶ 4(v); Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(iii); Howes Aff. ¶ 6.\n\nAlthough the hostages’ families tried to contact them by sending messages through the United\n\nStates Embassy, these messages were never delivered. Stansell Aff. ¶ 6. Additionally, despite\n\nhaving access to radios, the terrorists only permitted some of the men to listen periodically to hear\n\nmessages from their families. See Stansell Aff. ¶ 6; Howes Aff. ¶ 6; cf. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(iii).\n\nThe FARC also kept the Americans segregated from others, further isolating them. See Stansell\n\nAff. ¶ 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f       Furthermore, each of the men can recount specific acts that haunt him. Gonsalves recalls\n\none time being forced to carry a fifty-five pound backpack across a fallen tree “bridge” at gunpoint;\n\nthe bridge gave way while he was halfway across, causing him to fall more than four meters to the\n\nrocky bottom of a gully. Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 4(i). Despite suffering a concussion and being unable\n\nto move one arm, the FARC forced Gonsalves to continue to carry the backpack another 15 miles\n\nthrough the jungle the following day and for the next several months. Id. Stansell testified that,\n\none night, while being held in a cage and hearing helicopters overhead, FARC members stood\n\nbeside the cage and began discussing how to kill the hostages. Hearing this, Stansell approached\n\nthe terrorists and asked that the FARC members shoot them cleanly, rather than spray them with\n\ngunfire and cause painful, non-lethal wounds from which they would suffer while dying. Stansell\n\nAff. ¶ 4(xii). Lastly, Howes remembers the terrorists threatening to kill not only the hostages, but\n\nalso any civilian with whom they came in contact. Consequently, he testified to the emotional\n\nhorror of accidentally encountering a family of five in the jungle and then later learning that the\n\nFARC murdered them all. See Howes Aff. ¶ 4(vii).\n\n       All three men lived in constant fear of death. The FARC required at least one of its\n\nmembers to be physically near the hostages at all times, and the hostages were explicitly told that,\n\nin the event of a rescue attempt, the guard would shoot them. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes\n\noften saw helicopters flying overhead and witnessed the guards prepare their guns and position\n\nthemselves to fire upon the hostages. On other occasions FARC members approached each\n\nhostage and directly threatened to kill him, sometimes even dry-firing a weapon to simulate an\n\nexecution.

The Victims and the Claimants\n\n       Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves, and Thomas Howes, are all American citizens presently\n\nresiding in Florida.   Stansell is a former United States Marine and served as the mission\n\ncommander on the February 13, 2003, counter-narcotics surveillance flight. Compl., ECF No. 2\n\n[hereinafter Compl.], ¶ 6. Gonsalves is an electronic surveillance systems specialist and was the\n\nchief counter-narcotics analyst and collection officer on board. Id. ¶ 7. Howes is a highly\n\nexperienced pilot and was second-in-command on the flight. Id. ¶ 8.\n\n       Tom Janis was an American citizen and, at the time of his death, a resident of Alabama.\n\nId. ¶ 9. He was a retired United States Army aviator and spent 11 years as the Fixed Wing\n\nCommander of the U.S. Army’s Delta Force. Janis was the pilot of the plane on which the FARC\n\nopened fire on February 13, 2003. At the time he died, Janis was in peak physical condition and\n\nhad a routine of daily physical fitness. He left behind a spouse of more than 30 years, Judith Janis,\n\nand their four children—Christopher, Greer, Michael, and Jonathan. Pls.’ Ex.

Cir. 2013) (permitting legal representative\n\nof a deceased petitioner to continue a suit under the FSIA terrorism exception on behalf of a\n\ndeceased petitioner).\n\n       D.      Injuries Sustained by the Victims and the Claimants\n\n               1.       The Victims\n\n       Keith Stansell suffers from premature deterioration of the discs in his spine, sensitivity in\n\nhis feet, and permanent pain in his right torso as a result of the long, forced marches he had to\n\nendure, at times with broken ribs. He struggles with ongoing digestive problems, and he had to\n\nundergo months-long treatment for the flesh eating virus he contracted in the jungle. His time with\n\nthe FARC left him permanently disfigured. The flesh eating virus scarred his neck, crotch, and\n\nlegs, and the heavy chains he was forced to wear scarred his neck and shoulders. He still has a\n\nknot under the skin on his right hip where a cyst burst and had to be excised. Stansell’s pain and\n\nsuffering is not limited to physical ailments. He mourns the time and life experiences the FARC\n\nstole from him—he missed the birth of his twin sons, many years of family memories and holidays,\n\nand time spent with loved ones. Lastly, he continues to struggle emotionally with managing the\n\npsychological pain caused by his captivity and isolation. Stansell Aff. ¶¶ 11–13.\n\n       Marc Gonsalves also experiences ongoing physical and emotional scars as a result of being\n\nheld hostage. He has physical pain in his knees, legs, back, and shoulders, as well as frequent\n\nmigraines. Gonsalves’s short-term memory has been dramatically reduced, which affects his\n\nability to perform day-to-day tasks. In addition to insomnia and nightmares, Gonsalves suffers\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\ffrom various “triggers”—often sounds or smells—that induce extreme anxiety and nervousness,\n\nas though he is once again being held captive. Helicopters, in particular, incite panic and make\n\nGonsalves feel as though he is about to be killed. He cannot be in small spaces or amongst even\n\nmoderate-sized groups of people indoors. Gonsalves’s marriage failed as a result of his emotional\n\ninstability, and he no longer lives with his children. He laments the time he could have spent with\n\nhis children as they grew up and the active role he wishes he could have played in raising them.\n\nGonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 10–12.\n\n       Thomas Howes, too, suffers physically and emotionally as a result of his time in captivity.\n\nHe has lived for years with intestinal parasites, deteriorated eyesight, constant sore throat,\n\nesophageal erosion, leg cramps, and constant pain in his knees, ankles, and neck. Further, he finds\n\nhimself consumed with stress, unable to stop worrying about how his experience in South America\n\nwith the FARC will affect his relationships and professional career. The emotional trauma he\n\nsuffered caused his marriage to fail, and he grieves the lost time with his family. Particularly\n\npainful for Howes was the passing of his father while he was being held by the FARC. Howes\n\nwas very close with his father, and in addition to losing the opportunity to say goodbye to him,\n\nHowes is emotionally scarred by the fact that his father suffered in his last days from knowing his\n\nson was kidnapped. Howes Aff. ¶ 11–13.\n\n               2.      The Claimants\n\n       Tom and Judith Janis were married for more than 30 years, and Tom was “the love of\n\n[Judith’s] life.” Jud. Janis Aff. ¶ 8. The couple raised four children together, and Judith was proud\n\nto be Tom’s wife, “knowing that no matter what life would bring [they] would get through it\n\ntogether.” Id. ¶ 11. Although Tom traveled frequently for work in Colombia, the couple never\n\nspent more than 10 days apart. Judith frequently traveled to Colombia to visit Tom. On the day\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fTom was murdered, Judith had been visiting; the couple kissed goodbye in the morning at the\n\nColombian airport, and Judith boarded a commercial flight home to Alabama. Id. ¶ 10. Judith\n\nremembers his smile, their kiss, and Tom saying: “See you in 10 days honey girl.” Id. Judith\n\nlearned Tom’s plane had crashed from two voicemails left on her answering machine while she\n\nwas traveling that day. Thirty-six hours later, the president of Tom’s company flew to Alabama\n\nto tell Judith in person that her husband had been killed. Id. ¶ 16. Judith spent years investigating\n\nthe details of Tom’s death. Only upon Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes returning to the United\n\nStates did Judith learn that the FARC had ordered Tom killed. Id. ¶ 17. Judith thinks of her late\n\nhusband every day and continues to grieve his death, 13 years later. When she learned of Tom’s\n\npassing, she “really didn’t believe that life could go on,” and today still feels “the other part of\n\n[her] is missing.” Id. ¶ 16. Tom’s absence is particularly pronounced on holidays, birthdays, and\n\nfamily gatherings. Id. ¶ 19. Judith has not remarried. Id. ¶¶ 3, 16.\n\n       Christopher Janis was 30 years old when his father was murdered. Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 5,\n\nAff. of Christopher Janis, ECF No. 17-5 [hereinafter C. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 2–3. He had a “close and\n\nloving relationship” with his father while growing up, and followed in Tom’s footsteps by enlisting\n\nin the Army. Id. ¶¶ 4, 9. In addition to teaching Christopher to drive and to water ski, Tom shared\n\na special relationship with his son over their parallel military service. Id. ¶¶ 4–6. Christopher’s\n\nlast memory of his father is from early 2003, when Tom drove Christopher to the assembly point\n\nfor Christopher’s deployment to Kuwait. Christopher remembers his father waving to him through\n\nthe window of the truck, smiling. Id. ¶ 7. Christopher learned of his father’s plane crash while in\n\nKuwait, on February 14, 2003. While in the Atlanta International Airport, Christopher’s wife told\n\nhim his father had died. See id. ¶ 11. The news caused Christopher to immediately lose his breath,\n\nbecome weak in the knees, and break down crying. He still hates the Atlanta airport today because\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fof that memory. Id. Christopher’s grief is continuous, particularly now that he has retired from\n\nthe military. Id. ¶ 13. He was looking forward to talking with his father about their combat\n\nexperiences and his feelings from his deployments. Id. ¶ 10. He tries to live his life in a manner\n\nof which his father would be proud, but feels his accomplishments are less rewarding without Tom\n\nhere to enjoy them with him. Id.\n\n        Greer Janis was 29 years old when Tom was murdered and she, too, shared a close and\n\nloving relationship with her father. Greer could talk to her father about “anything” and often\n\nsought her father’s advice. Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 7, Aff. of Greer Janis, ECF No. 17-7 [hereinafter\n\nG. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 3–4. She visited home frequently because it was “a place of acceptance,\n\ntolerance, and love.” Id. ¶ 4. Because Tom was murdered the day before Valentine’s Day,\n\nValentine’s Day became a “dark day” for Greer, causing her annually to “relive the horror” of\n\nhearing her mother tell her that her father’s plane had been out of contact with the radio tower. Id.\n\n¶ 6. Each Valentine’s Day, she “relive[d] the anxiety and trepidation of not knowing what had\n\nhappened, and was happening, to [her] dad.” Id. The first Christmas and New Year’s Eve without\n\nTom were difficult for Greer, particularly because New Year’s Eve was her parents’ wedding\n\nanniversary. See id. Greer thought of her father every day, and her grief and loss continued even\n\n13 years after his murder. Id. ¶ 9. She wished she could share moments in her life with Tom or\n\nseek his advice. See id. Greer feels pain every day because her father “was ripped away from\n\n[her] and [her] family.” Id. Tom was “an intrinsic part of [Greer’s] life” and his death “made a\n\nhole in [her] life.” Id. Greer died on July 26, 2016, at the age of 42. See G. Janis Death Certificate;\n\ncf. G. Janis Aff. ¶ 3.\n\n        Michael Janis was 25 years old when Tom was murdered. He, too, enjoyed a close and\n\nloving relationship with his father and, like Christopher, followed in his father’s footsteps by\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fbecoming an Army aviator. He is currently on active duty with the United States Army. Pls.’ Ex.\n\nList II, Ex. 6, Aff. of Michael Janis, ECF No. 17-6 [hereinafter M. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 3–4. Michael\n\ndescribes Tom as not only a father, but also a “very close friend.” Id. ¶ 4. He laments that they\n\nwill not get to share any more father-son talks and wishes Tom could have been there to see his\n\nwings pinned on his uniform after graduating from flight school. See id. ¶¶ 4–5. Every Father’s\n\nDay, Michael goes through a box of his father’s things, feeling sad because Tom “had so much\n\nmore life to live, so many more milestones, and moments with his children that [the family] [is]\n\nall missing.” Id. ¶ 6. Michael learned of the plane crash from seeing headlines on the Internet,\n\nand his wife and he took turns scouring websites for updates. Michael learned that his father had\n\nbeen killed when he heard his wife scream and saw CNN’s website reporting that Tom’s body had\n\nbeen found by the plane. He remembers the strangeness of seeing CNN misreport his father’s\n\nname as “Janis Thomas,” rather than “Thomas Janis,” and feeling “sick, confused, and scared for\n\n[his] mother.” See id. ¶ 8. Because his mother was still traveling back from Colombia, Michael\n\nhad to keep this information to himself for several hours, which was “utterly devastating.” Id.\n\nAlthough Michael “tries not to think of the worst moments of this tragedy,” id., he still finds it\n\n“next to impossible to choose to avoid the pain and emptiness his [father’s] murder brought to [his]\n\nfamily,” id. ¶ 4. Tom’s death has created a “darkness and emptiness” in his life. Michael blames\n\nTom’s murder for his divorce from his high school sweetheart, and he wishes he and Tom could\n\ntalk about serving overseas. Id. ¶¶ 10, 11. Michael has been unable to dream since Tom’s murder\n\nand has not yet found peace with Tom’s death, which “has been the most traumatic, painful, life-\n\naltering event [he] ha[s] ever experienced.” Id. ¶¶ 9, 12.\n\n       Jonathan Janis was 23 years old when his father was murdered. Jonathan, like his siblings,\n\nenjoyed a close and loving relationship with Tom. Pls.’ Ex. List II, Ex. 8, Aff. of Jonathan Janis,\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\fECF No. 17-8 [hereinafter Jon. Janis Aff.], ¶¶ 1–2. In addition to growing up with his father’s\n\nhelp on homework and presence at school events, Jonathan enjoyed regular phone calls with his\n\nfather as an adult. See id. ¶¶ 3–4. On their last Sunday phone call, Tom and Jonathan discussed\n\ntheir plans to have Tom and Judith visit Jonathan in Florida “for a Valentines week mini-vacation.”\n\nId. ¶ 4. The news of Tom’s plane having gone down was “unfathomable” to Jonathan, who told\n\nhimself his father had to be fine because they had already booked hotel reservations and theme\n\npark tickets for the upcoming trip. See id. ¶ 5. Two days later, Jonathan learned from a resident\n\nassistant at Walt Disney World, where he was interning, that his father had been shot in the head\n\nand killed. Id. ¶ 6. During his father’s funeral, Jonathan held his mother while she wept. Id.\n\nJonathan thinks of his father every day, and his grief and loss continues 13 years later. Id. ¶ 7.\n\nHolidays—Thanksgiving, in particular—are difficult for Jonathan. See id. ¶ 4. For two years, he\n\nkept his father’s cell phone number programmed in his cell phone, unwilling to delete the entry.\n\nId. ¶ 7. Jonathan wears his father’s “watch and wedding band as a daily reminder” and is sad that\n\nhe “no longer ha[s] [his] sounding board.” In particular, he misses his father’s “motivational talks\n\nand tenderness.” Id. Jonathan wishes his future children could have known their grandfather. See\n\nid. At one point in time, Tom and Jonathan had “toyed with the notion of a frame shop where\n\n[Jonathan would] do the matting and [Tom would] make the frame,” which “will now never\n\nhappen.” Id. ¶ 7.\n\n       E.      Procedural History\n\n       Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against the Republic of Cuba under 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(c), a\n\nfederal statute that provides certain plaintiffs with a private cause of action against a foreign state\n\nwhose sponsorship of terrorism causes the plaintiff personal injury or death. Stansell, Gonsalves,\n\nand Howes seek damages for pain and suffering as a result of the acts of aircraft sabotage, hostage-\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\ftaking, and torture they endured at the hands of the FARC. Judith Janis and her children seek\n\nsolatium damages for the emotional trauma of losing their husband and father.\n\n         Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on September 17, 2015, and requested a summons be\n\nissued. See Compl.; Req. for Summons to Issue, ECF No. 5. After concluding service could not\n\nbe effected, Plaintiffs asked the Clerk of Court to mail by DHL Express one copy of the summons,\n\ncomplaint, and notice of suit, together with a translation of each into Spanish, to the Minister of\n\nForeign Affairs for the Republic of Cuba. See Aff. Req’g Foreign Mailing, ECF No. 6; Req. for\n\nClerk to Effect Service, ECF No. 9.\n\n         On September 22, 2015, Plaintiffs filed proof of service, reflecting that an individual in the\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs in Havana signed for the package sent by the Clerk of Court.\n\nSee Return of Serv., ECF No. 11. When Cuba failed to file an Answer to the Complaint within\n\n60 days, the Clerk of Court filed an entry of default. See Entry of Default as to the Republic of\n\nCuba, ECF. No. 13 (dated Dec. 9, 2015); 28 U.S.C. § 1608(d); Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). Plaintiffs\n\nthen filed the Motion for Default Judgment presently before the court. See Pls.’ Mot. for Default\n\nJ., ECF. No. 18. The court invited the United States to file a Statement of Interest, but it declined\n\nto do so. See Minute Order, dated June 20, 2016; Notice by United States of America, ECF No.\n\n20; Notice by United States of America, ECF No. 32.2\n\nII.

Id.\n\nIII.    DISCUSSION\n\n        A.      Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n        This court has original jurisdiction to hear suits brought against foreign states, irrespective\n\nof the amount in controversy, if the case is a nonjury civil action for in personam relief and the\n\nforeign state is not entitled to immunity under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1605–1607. See 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).\n\nAs a general matter, the FSIA insulates foreign states from being sued in American courts.\n\nHowever, § 1605A—colloquially known as the “terrorism exception”—abrogates a foreign state’s\n\nsovereign immunity when the foreign state either perpetrated or provided material support or\n\nresources for particular acts of terrorism resulting in personal injury or death. See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1605A(a)(1). A plaintiff relying upon this statutory provision to abrogate sovereign immunity\n\nand, thus, establish subject matter jurisdiction, must prove four elements:\n\n                (1) the foreign country was designated a state-sponsor of terrorism\n                at the time of the act, (2) the claimant or the victim was a national\n                of the United States at that time; (3) in a case in which the act\n                occurred in the foreign state against which the claim has been\n                brought, the claimant has afforded the foreign state a reasonable\n                opportunity to arbitrate the claim; and (4) the plaintiff seeks\n                monetary damages for personal injury or death caused by torture,\n                extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the\n                provision of material support or resources for such an act, if engaged\n                in by an official, employee, or agent of a foreign country.\n\nThuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 34 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Here, Plaintiffs bring this civil suit against Cuba for in personam relief and do not request\n\na jury trial. Compl. ¶ 1. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims provided\n\nCuba cannot claim sovereign immunity. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1); Thuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d\n\nat 34. The court concludes that Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence that Cuba’s sovereign\n\n                                                  17\n\fimmunity is abrogated by the FSIA terrorism exception and no other limitation bars the court from\n\nexercising subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n         Cuba was first designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1982, and the United States\n\ncontinuously maintained Cuba’s status on that list until May 29, 2015.3 Therefore, Cuba was a\n\nstate sponsor of terrorism for the entire period during which the FARC’s terrorist acts against\n\nPlaintiffs occurred—February 13, 2003, to July 2, 2008.

However, the United States’ reconciliation with\nCuba was a widely publicized event, the date of which is well known in the general population.

See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b), (c).\n\n                                                            18\n\f        Additionally, all Plaintiffs in this action—both the victims and the claimants—are\n\nAmerican citizens. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I); Stansell Aff. ¶ 1; Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 1;\n\nHowes Aff. ¶ 2; Jud. Janis Aff. ¶ 2; C. Janis Aff. ¶ 1; M. Janis Aff. ¶ 1; G. Janis Aff. ¶ 3; Jon. Janis\n\nAff. ¶ 1.\n\n        Section 1605A(c)’s third requirement—that the defendant nation be provided an\n\nopportunity to arbitrate—does not apply here, as the acts of terrorism at issue did not occur in\n\nCuba. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n        Lastly, Plaintiffs also presented satisfactory evidence to establish that their damages arise\n\nfrom Cuba’s provision of material support and resources to the FARC, which committed aircraft\n\nsabotage, the extrajudicial killing of Janis, and the hostage-taking and torture of Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes. See id. § 1605A(a)(1).\n\n        Under the FSIA, “aircraft sabotage” involves, in relevant part, “destroy[ing] an aircraft in\n\nservice or caus[ing] damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight.” Id.\n\n§ 1605A(h)(1); Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil\n\nAviation, art. I, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 565, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">151803</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The evidence Plaintiffs proffer\n\nreflects that members of the FARC shot at Plaintiffs’ aircraft while it was in flight, causing it to\n\ncrash-land. See Cote Aff. ¶¶ 20, 44, 45(a)–(b); Stansell Aff. ¶ 2; Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 2; Howes Aff.\n\n¶ 2. These facts meet the definition of “aircraft sabotage” under § 1605A.\n\n        The evidence presented also satisfactorily shows that Tom Janis was the victim of an\n\nextrajudicial killing, and Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were the victims of torture.              An\n\n“extrajudicial killing” is a “deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced\n\nby a regularly constituted court,” and an act of “torture” is “any act directed against an individual\n\nin the offender’s custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering[,] . . . is\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fintentionally inflicted . . . for such purposes as obtaining . . . information or a confession, punishing\n\nthat individual for an act that individual . . . has committed or is suspected of having committed,\n\nintimidating or coercing that individual, . . . or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.”\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1605A(h)(7); Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-256, § 3, 106\n\nStat. 73 (1992). Janis’s execution in the jungle was not sanctioned by any court and plainly\n\nconstitutes an “extrajudicial killing” within the meaning of the FSIA. See Jud. Janis Aff. ¶ 17;\n\nStansell Aff. ¶ 10; Gonsalves Aff. ¶ 9; Howes Aff. ¶ 10; Cote Aff. ¶ 45(c); Stmt. of Offense ¶ 8.\n\nSimilarly, the evidence reflects that the FARC “tortured” Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes within\n\nthe meaning of the FSIA by targeting them as Americans and, while holding them hostage, denying\n\nthem food and necessary medical attention; forcing them to march for long periods while suffering\n\nillness and injury; confining them to a barbed wire cage for months; forcing them to breathe heavy\n\ngasoline fumes as a form of punishment; chaining them to one another and trees; preventing them\n\nfrom communicating for months at a time; repeatedly threatening them with death; performing\n\nmock executions; and preventing them from performing basic bodily functions with decency and\n\nprivacy in order to humiliate and degrade them. See Stansell Aff. ¶¶ 3–6; Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 3–4;\n\nHowes Aff. ¶¶ 3–4.\n\n        Additionally, Plaintiffs’ evidence shows Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were taken\n\nhostage within the meaning of the FSIA. “Hostage taking” is defined by federal and international\n\nlaw to mean “seiz[ing] or detain[ing] and threaten[ing] to kill, to injure, or to continue to detain\n\nanother . . . in order to compel a third party, namely, a State, . . . to do or abstain from doing any\n\nact as an explicit or implicit condition [of the hostage’s] . . . release.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(h)(2);\n\nInternational Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, art. I, T.I.A.S. No. 11081, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">144724</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The FARC’s acts of surrounding the downed aircraft, detaining its passengers, and\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\fseparating and forcibly holding Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes against their will for 1,967 days\n\nin order to leverage concessions from the Colombian and United States governments\n\nunquestionably constitutes “hostage-taking” under the FSIA. See Stmt. of Offense ¶ 16(e);\n\nStansell Aff. ¶¶ 2–3; Gonsalves Aff. ¶¶ 2–3; Howes Aff. ¶¶ 2–3.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs’ evidence proves to this court’s satisfaction that Cuba provided material\n\nsupport and resources in furtherance of the FARC’s actions. “Material support or resources”\n\nincludes the provision of “any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or\n\nmonetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or\n\nassistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment,\n\nfacilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel . . . , and transportation, except\n\nmedicine or religious materials.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(h)(3); 18 U.S.C. § 2339A. Plaintiffs’\n\nevidence shows that Cuba had a relationship with the FARC not only at the time the FARC shot\n\ndown Plaintiff’s aircraft, but also throughout the time the FARC held Stansell, Gonsalves, and\n\nHowes captive. At all times relevant to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the Cuban government provided,\n\ninter alia, safe haven for FARC members, political and military support for the FARC’s trafficking\n\nof cocaine through Venezuela, weapons, financial support, military training, and expert advice on\n\nthe production and trade of illicit drugs. Cuba also facilitated FARC members’ travel through\n\nVenezuela and Cuba. See Roig Decl. at 14–16, 19–20, 23–25; Cote Aff. ¶¶ 7–8, 16, 23(f), 28–35,\n\n43; Patterns of Global Terrorism 2003 at 3; Country Reports on Terrorism 2004 at 3; Country\n\nReports on Terrorism 2005 at 7; Country Reports on Terrorism 2006; Country Reports on\n\nTerrorism 2007 at 3; Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 at 4–5. This material support enabled\n\nthe FARC to commit international acts of terrorism, including, but not limited to, facilitating their\n\ntargeting of Americans; attacking the aircraft carrying Stansell, Gonsalves, Howes, and Janis;\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fkilling Janis and holding Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes hostage; moving the hostages throughout\n\nthe jungle to avoid detection; guarding the hostages under threat of death; and keeping the hostages\n\ncaptive for more than five years. See Cote Aff. ¶¶ 45–46, 49; Roig Decl. at 24–25.\n\n       The court also acknowledges that this action is timely. Plaintiffs filed suit on September\n\n17, 2015, which is within the six-month window after Cuba was relieved of its designation as a\n\nstate sponsor of terrorism. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(a)(2)(A)(I)(i). Plaintiffs’ suit also is within 10\n\nyears of the victims’ rescue on July 2, 2008. See id. § 1605A(b)(2).\n\n       Thus, the court is satisfied that it may exercise its subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n       B.      Personal Jurisdiction\n\n       Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state exists if service is made pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1608. See 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b). Section 1608 provides four means of effecting service on a\n\nforeign state: (1) “by special arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the foreign state or\n\npolitical subdivision”; (2) “in accordance with an applicable international convention on service\n\nof judicial documents”; (3) if neither of the first two options is available, then by “sending a copy\n\nof the summons and complaint and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each into the\n\nofficial language of the foreign state, by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be\n\naddressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of\n\nthe foreign state concerned”; or (4) if the third option cannot effect service within thirty days, then\n\nby requesting that the clerk of the court send two copies of the aforementioned materials to “the\n\nSecretary of State in Washington, District of Columbia, to the attention of the Director of Special\n\nConsular Services,” whereupon the Secretary will then send one copy of the papers “through\n\ndiplomatic channels to the foreign state and shall send to the clerk of the court a certified copy of\n\nthe diplomatic notice indicating when the papers were transmitted.” 28 U.S.C. § 1608(a).\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f       Plaintiffs properly effected service on October 6, 2015, when they filed with the court proof\n\nthat the Complaint, Summons, and Notice of Suit, together with a copy of each in Spanish, were\n\nserved on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and signed for in Havana. See Certificate of Mailing,\n\nECF No. 10; Return of Service/Aff., ECF No. 11. Service in accordance with § 1608(a)(3) was\n\nappropriate because, at the time Plaintiffs commenced suit, Cuba had neither a special arrangement\n\nfor service with Plaintiffs nor entered into an international convention governing service. See Pls.’\n\nReq. for Clerk to Effect Service, ECF No. 9. Accordingly, Plaintiffs established that service was\n\nproperly effected and the court is satisfied that it has personal jurisdiction over Cuba.\n\n       C.      Cuba’s Liability to Plaintiffs\n\n       Section 1605A(c) offers certain plaintiffs a federal cause of action against a foreign state\n\nthat perpetrated or provided material support for an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, hostage\n\ntaking, or aircraft sabotage, resulting in the plaintiff’s personal injury or death.        28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1605A(c). This cause of action has five elements: (1) “an act of torture, extrajudicial killing,\n\naircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act”;\n\n(2) committed or materially supported by the defendant foreign state or an official, employee, or\n\nagent of the defendant foreign state; (3) that “caused”; (4) “personal injury or death”; (5) “for\n\nwhich courts of the United States may maintain jurisdiction under this section for money\n\ndamages.” Id. §§ 1605A(a)(1), (c). Additionally, the plaintiff must be an American citizen, a\n\nmember of the armed forces, a government employee or individual performing a government\n\ncontract and acting within the scope of that employment, or a legal representative thereof. Id.\n\n§ 1605A(c). Lastly, the defendant foreign state has to be, have been at the time of the attack, or\n\nhave been so designated as a result of the attack, a state sponsor of terrorism.                   Id.\n\n§§ 1605A(a)(2)(A)(i), (c).\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f        Although the statute sets out the private cause of action, it offers no substantive guidance\n\nas to what will satisfy the causation and injury elements of that cause of action. As a result, courts\n\nrely on “generalized principles of tort law” to determine whether the defendant is legally\n\nresponsible for the plaintiff’s harm. See Thuneibat, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 38; cf. Bettis v. Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185852\"><a href=\"/opinion/185852/jenco-douglas-j-v-islam-repub-iran/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that, in FSIA state-sponsored\n\nterrorism exception cases, the federal courts must apply traditional tort principles from the\n\nRestatement and existing state law, rather than develop federal common law).\n\n        It is not enough for plaintiffs to “simply alleg[e] that an act ‘caused harm.’” Rimkus v.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2473903\"><a href=\"/opinion/2473903/rimkus-v-islamic-republic-of-iran/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175 (D.D.C. 2010). Instead, § 1605A(c) requires\n\nthat plaintiffs establish causation not only as a matter of fact, but also as a matter of law. Id.\n\nTherefore, plaintiffs seeking to recover damages under § 1605A(c) “must articulate the\n\njustification for . . . recovery, generally through the lens of civil tort liability.” Id. at 176. In other\n\nwords, plaintiffs must identify a particular theory of tort liability—e.g., intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress, wrongful death, battery—to properly raise a claim under § 1605A(c).\n\n                1.      The Direct Victims—Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes\n\n        Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were American citizens at the time of the February 13,\n\n2003, attack, and, as explained previously, Cuba was designated a state sponsor of terrorism for\n\nthe entire period during which Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were held hostage and tortured.\n\n        In addition, the court has already concluded that Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes suffered\n\nacts of aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, and torture—as those terms are understood under the\n\nFSIA—at the hands of the FARC, and the record evidence demonstrates that Cuba provided\n\nmaterial support to the FARC. Lastly, the court has determined it has jurisdiction over this matter\n\n\n\n\n                                                    24\n\fand Plaintiffs seek only monetary compensation. See supra III.A. Therefore, the first, second,\n\nand fifth elements of § 1605A(c) are satisfied.\n\n       With respect to causation and injury, Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes specified no\n\nparticular theory of relief to justify their receipt of damages—instead, each plaintiff seeks\n\ncompensation for “the 1,967 days of captivity as a hostage and for his physical and mental torture\n\nduring captivity, including past and future physical and mental pain and suffering, disability,\n\ndisfigurement, permanent injuries, and lost enjoyment of life.” See Compl. (concluding prayer for\n\nrelief). This type of pleading is a “caused harm” pleading—for which this court has admonished\n\nplaintiffs. See Rimkus, 750 F. Supp. 3d at 175, 183 (explaining that plaintiff failed to plead a\n\ntheory of relief when he alleged only that his son died and defendants were responsible for his\n\nson’s death).\n\n       Nonetheless, courts in this District previously have allowed a plaintiff’s FSIA claim to\n\nproceed, even absent a clearly articulated theory of recovery, when the plaintiff alleged all the facts\n\nnecessary to establish the elements of § 1605A(c). See, e.g., id. at 176, 181–82; Valencia v. Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2474505\"><a href=\"/opinion/2474505/valencia-v-islamic-republic-of-iran/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12–13 (D.D.C. 2010); cf. Oveissi v. Islamic Republic of Iran,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (D.D.C. 2012). Here, the court is presented with all the facts necessary to\n\nestablish causation and injury and, therefore, “will not exalt form over substance” to preclude\n\nrelief. See Rimkus, 750 F. Supp. 2d at 176. Instead, the court will look to state decisional law,\n\nlegal treatises, and the Restatements to identify an applicable theory of recovery in concert with\n\nthe evidence presented. See id. at 183–84; Valencia, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 12–13.\n\n       The language Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes use in their Complaint and the evidence\n\nbefore the court largely align with the quintessential common law torts of battery (aircraft sabotage\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fand physical torture); false imprisonment (hostage taking); and assault and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress (mental and emotional harm). Cf. Valencia, 774 F. Supp. 2d at 13.\n\n       With respect to the acts of aircraft sabotage and physical torture, Stansell, Gonsalves, and\n\nHowes may recover under a theory of battery. Battery occurs when one person (1) “acts intending\n\nto cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other . . . or an imminent\n\napprehension of such a contact, and (2) a harmful contact with the person of the other directly or\n\nindirectly results.” See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 13; Valencia, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 13;\n\nSutherland v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2491892\"><a href=\"/opinion/2491892/sutherland-v-islamic-republic-of-iran/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (D.D.C. 2001) (describing physical\n\ntorture as an extreme form of battery). “Harmful contact” is that which causes “any physical\n\nimpairment of the condition of another’s body, or physical pain or illness,” see RESTATEMENT\n\n(SECOND) OF TORTS § 15, and can be caused by contacting either another’s person directly or an\n\ninstrumentality that acts as an extension of the individual’s person, such as a car or airplane in\n\nwhich the individual is traveling, see id. § 18 cmt. c & Rptr.’s Notes.\n\n       Here, a battery occurred both when the FARC shot down the airplane and when the\n\nterrorists subsequently tortured their hostages. The FARC’s act of shooting down a moving\n\naircraft was an intentional harmful contact to those onboard. Similarly, the acts of physical\n\ntorture—e.g., chaining the hostages to one another and to trees, forcing them to breathe gasoline\n\nfumes, imposing unwanted medical treatment on them—were direct, intentional, harmful contacts.\n\nThe hostages suffered physical injuries from the plane crash, disfigurement from the chains, and\n\ncontinue to suffer from the effects of the FARC’s forced medical treatments. See supra I.D.\n\n       In light of the evidence presented, the court has little trouble concluding that Cuba provided\n\nthe FARC with the materials, training, and resources necessary to carry out these batteries—the\n\naircraft sabotage and physical torture—and that it did so with intent to harm these plaintiffs. Cuba\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fintentionally provided support to the FARC over a number of years and encouraged the FARC to\n\nuse violence to promote its political agenda. That provision of support and encouragement\n\nfacilitated the acts perpetrated against Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes. See Cote Aff. ¶¶ 27–28,\n\n32; Roig Decl. at 24. Cuba’s support allowed for “[s]ophisticated communications between FARC\n\nFronts tracking the aircraft and seeking permission to shoot it down”; the shooting down of the\n\nplane; “move[ment] of the U.S. hostages repeatedly over 5 years and . . . maint[enance] of\n\nstructures in the jungle for their imprisonment and torture”; and “the necessary logistic[al] support\n\nin order to keep the hostages captive.” Cote Aff. ¶ 45; see id. ¶¶ 29, 31, 38. Thus, Cuba is\n\nresponsible, under a theory of battery, for the injuries Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes sustained\n\nfrom the FARC sabotaging their aircraft and torturing them.\n\n       Cuba may be held liable under the theory of false imprisonment for the FARC’s acts of\n\nhostage taking. Under general principles of tort law, a plaintiff may recover for false imprisonment\n\nwhen one person “(a) acts intending to confine the other . . . within boundaries fixed by the actor,\n\nand (b) his act directly or indirectly results in such a confinement of the other, and (c) the other is\n\nconscious of the confinement or is harmed by it.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 35. It is\n\nindisputable that Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes were held against their will for 1,967 days, and\n\nPlaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for this court to conclude that Cuba’s provision of material\n\nsupport to the FARC allowed the terrorists not only to organize the act of aircraft sabotage, but\n\nalso to take and hold captive the three Americans. See Cote Aff. ¶ 45; Roig Decl. at 24; Levin v.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2399649\"><a href=\"/opinion/2399649/levin-v-islamic-republic-of-iran/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (D.D.C. 2007). Accordingly, the court concludes\n\nCuba is liable to Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes, under principles of false imprisonment, for the\n\npain and suffering they endured as a result of the conditions of their confinement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f       In addition, Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes may recover under a theory of assault for the\n\nmental torture they endured at the hands of the FARC. An assault occurs when one person (a) “acts\n\nintending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other . . ., or an imminent\n\napprehension of such a contact, and (b) the other is thereby put in such imminent apprehension.”\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND)       OF   TORTS § 21. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes suffered imminent\n\napprehension of death when the FARC tortured them with mock executions and visible\n\npreparations to kill them each time a helicopter flew nearby. Cuba may be held liable under the\n\ncommon law tort principles of assault for the mental harms Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes\n\nsuffered because it provided material support to the FARC’s activities. See supra I.B, I.D.1.\n\n       Lastly, these plaintiffs may also recover under a theory of intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress for the emotional trauma they endured. A defendant is liable for intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress when he, “by extreme and outrageous conduct[,] intentionally or\n\nrecklessly causes severe emotional distress to” the plaintiff. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §\n\n46. Terrorist acts themselves are intentional acts, aimed to cause severe emotional distress. See\n\nLevin, 529 F. Supp. 2d at 17. “Moreover, the act of engaging in terrorism by means of material\n\nsupport . . . is extreme, outrageous, and goes beyond all possible bounds of decency.” Id. Cuba’s\n\nprovision of material support to the FARC, which allowed for the attack on February 13, 2003,\n\nand hostage-taking, is extreme and outrageous conduct that intentionally caused Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes severe emotional distress. These plaintiffs suffered extreme emotional\n\nanguish when forcibly marched through the jungle, denied medical care, refused communication\n\nwith their loved ones, kept in cages, chained to trees and one another, prevented from performing\n\nbasic bodily functions and needs, mock executed, and regularly being told they would be killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fSee supra I.B, I.D.1. Cuba is liable for these harms as a result of directly financing, training, and\n\notherwise providing material support to the FARC.\n\n       In sum, Cuba is liable to Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes for the harm caused them by the\n\nFARC’s acts of sabotaging their aircraft, taking and holding them hostage for 1,967 days, and\n\nphysically and psychologically torturing them during their captivity.\n\n               2.       The Indirect Victims—Judith Janis and the Janis Children\n\n       Judith Janis and her four children seek damages against Cuba for their “past and future loss\n\nof solatium, mental anguish, bereavement, grief, loss of spousal [and parental] society, comfort,\n\naffections, and guidance.” See Compl. (closing prayer for relief). They are American citizen-\n\nclaimants who seek monetary relief for the extrajudicial killing of their husband and father, Tom\n\nJanis, at the hands of the FARC, which received material support and resources from Cuba.\n\nSee supra III.A. Therefore, the first, second, and fifth elements of their cause of action are\n\nsatisfied. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(A)(c). Thus, the court focuses its discussion on the elements of\n\ncausation and injury.\n\n       Claims for solatium under the FSIA are nearly indistinguishable from claims for intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress. See Flanagan v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115\n\n(D.D.C. 2015); Belkin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (D.D.C. 2009). The same\n\nframework outlined above applies, see supra III.C.1, and plaintiffs who are not the direct victim\n\nof the “extreme and outrageous conduct” may still recover under § 1605A(C) “if they are members\n\nof the [v]ictim’s immediate family and the defendants’ conduct is sufficiently outrageous and\n\nintended to inflict severe emotional harm upon a person who is not present.” Thuneibat, 167 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f       Judith, Christopher, Greer, Michael, and Jonathan have presented sufficient evidence to\n\nsatisfy all the elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. They are the\n\nwidow and children of Tom Janis, and thus qualify as “members of the [v]ictim’s immediate\n\nfamily.” See id. Moreover, as just discussed, Cuba’s provision of material support and resources\n\nto the FARC—who had previously committed acts of terrorism—was sufficiently outrageous and\n\nextreme that the Janis family members did not have to be present to suffer severe emotional harm.\n\nTheir declarations make clear that each family member suffered an immense loss with the death\n\nof Tom Janis, and Cuba’s support enabled the FARC to perpetrate the acts that caused their severe\n\nemotional distress.\n\n       Judith lost her husband of more than 30 years—“the love of [her] life”—and spent years\n\nafter his death investigating what happened in his final moments and who murdered him. She\n\ncontinues to grieve daily and has no intention of remarrying. Jud. Janis Aff. ¶¶ 8, 16, 17, 19.\n\n       All four children enjoyed a close and loving relationship with their father. C. Janis Aff.\n\n¶ 4; M. Janis Aff. ¶ 4; G. Janis Aff. ¶ 4; Jon. Janis Aff. ¶ 2. Christopher was told of his father’s\n\nplane crash while deployed overseas, flew home immediately, and while in the Atlanta airport\n\nlearned his father had been killed. He is saddened that he will never be able to talk to his father\n\nabout their shared experiences serving in the military and feels his accomplishments are less\n\nrewarding without being able to share them with his father. C. Janis Aff. ¶¶ 10–11.\n\n       Every Father’s Day, Michael Janis goes through a box of his father’s belongings. Michael\n\nlearned his father had been killed from misspelled headlines on CNN, and it was devastating for\n\nhim to have to keep the news to himself while his mother was still traveling home from Colombia.\n\nM. Janis Aff. ¶¶ 6, 8. Tom’s death has created a “darkness and emptiness” in Michael’s life, and\n\nMichael blames his father’s murder for his divorce. Id. ¶ 11. He has not yet found peace with\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fTom’s death, which “has been the most traumatic, painful, life-altering event [Michael] ha[s] ever\n\nexperienced.” Id. ¶¶ 9, 12.\n\n           Following her father’s death, Valentine’s Day became a “dark day” for Greer, causing her\n\nto become filled with anxiety about what happened to her father on February 13, 2003, and to\n\n“relive the horror” of hearing the news that he had been killed. G. Janis Aff. ¶ 6. She had traveled\n\nhome often to visit because of the close relationship she had with her father; Tom was “an intrinsic\n\npart of [Greer’s] life” and his death “made a hole in [her] life.” Id. ¶ 9.\n\n           Jonathan, the youngest child, wears his father’s “watch and wedding band as a daily\n\nreminder” of his loss. Jon. Janis Aff. ¶ 7. He is sad that he “no longer ha[s] [his] sounding board.”\n\nId. During his father’s funeral, Jonathan held his mother while she wept. Id. ¶ 6. For two years,\n\nhe kept his father’s cell phone number programmed in his cell phone, unwilling to delete the entry.\n\nId. ¶ 7.\n\n           Thus, the members of the Janis family provided satisfactory evidence that Cuba is liable to\n\nthem under § 1605A(c) for the severe emotional distress caused by the February 13, 2003, attack\n\nand extrajudicial killing of their husband and father, Tom Janis.\n\n           D.     Damages\n\n           The purpose of § 1605A(c) is to allow victims of state-sponsored terrorism to hold liable\n\ncountries that support terrorist groups for the consequences flowing from that support. Thus, the\n\nplain text of the FSIA allows plaintiffs to pursue “economic damages, solatium, pain and suffering,\n\nand punitive damages.” 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(c). To be awarded damages under this provision, the\n\nplaintiff “must prove that the consequences of the foreign state’s conduct were reasonably certain\n\n(i.e., more likely than not) to occur, and must prove the amount of damages by a reasonable\n\nestimate consistent with this Circuit’s application of the American rule on damages.” Thuneibat,\n\n\n\n                                                   31\n\f167 F. Supp. 3d at 47–48 (alteration adopted and internal quotation marks omitted). Expert\n\ntestimony and prior awards of damages in comparable FSIA cases inform the court’s determination\n\nof what constitutes a “reasonable estimate.” Id. at 48.\n\n       Here, Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that Tom Janis’s death, the harm caused\n\nStansell, Gonsalves, and Howes as hostages, and the ongoing pain and suffering of the former\n\nhostages and grieving Janis family members were reasonably certain and actually intended\n\nconsequences of Cuba’s material support of the FARC. Cuba knowingly encouraged, supplied,\n\nsheltered, and provided weapons and military training to these terrorists, who specifically targeted\n\nAmerican citizens for their attacks. Cote Aff. ¶¶ 31–33, 37–38, 41; Roig Decl. at 13–15, 16–17,\n\n24. In addition, Cuba utilized its close relationship with the Venezuelan government to facilitate\n\nthe FARC’s distribution of cocaine and safe travel along the Colombian-Venezuelan border,\n\nallowing the FARC to participate in international drug trafficking and evade efforts to thwart their\n\noperations, including recovery of the hostages. Roig Decl. at 16–17; see Cote Aff. ¶ 47. By\n\nsupporting the FARC in this way, Cuba made the acts of terrorism at issue in this case and the pain\n\nand suffering they caused reasonably certain to occur. Thus, Plaintiffs have shown that they are\n\nentitled to an award of damages.\n\n       Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes seek compensation for their pain and suffering, while\n\nJudith and the Janis children seek solatium damages for the emotional trauma of losing their\n\nhusband and father. While quantifying these types of harms is inherently difficult, the court’s\n\n“primary consideration is to ensure that individuals with similar injuries receive similar rewards.”\n\nMoradi v.

The court concludes that framework is appropriate. Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes were held captive for 1,967 days, for which the court will award each victim\n\n$19,670,000. As in other FSIA cases, however, this base award falls short of compensating the\n\nhostage victims for the full extent of their injuries. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes suffered\n\nextreme physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of the FARC, made possible by Cuba’s\n\nprovision of material support for the FARC’s activities. The hostages survived a plane crash only\n\nto be subjected to long marches, weighed down by chains, denied medical treatment, starved, and\n\nexposed to and forced to suffer from serious illnesses—some of which are permanent. In addition,\n\nthey lived in constant fear of death, far away from home and without contact from their loved ones,\n\nand under conditions that continue to haunt them today. This extreme suffering justifies an award\n\ngreater than the per diem calculation.\n\n       Rather than submit a specific lump sum request to the court, Plaintiffs simply ask for an\n\namount that is “fair and reasonable” under the case law. Stansell, Gonsalves, and Howes have\n\nsuffered, and will continue to suffer, life-long pain and suffering as a result of the FARC’s acts.\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fThe court concludes that the extent of the men’s injuries warrants an additional payment of\n\n$25,000,000 each. This award aligns with lump sum awards in other cases involving extreme\n\ncircumstances of hostage-taking. The amount of the award accounts for the length of time Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes were held hostage—which far exceeds the periods of captivity of plaintiffs\n\nin other FSIA cases decided in this District—the violent shooting down of their aircraft, the\n\nextremity of their treatment in the jungle, and the ongoing physical, psychological, and emotional\n\neffects of their experience. Cf., e.g., Wyatt, 908 F. Supp. 2d at 232 (awarding per diem amount of\n\n$210,000 for 21 days in captivity, plus $5,000,000 lump sum for pain and suffering); Massie, 592\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 77 (awarding per diem amount of $3,350,000 for 335 days in captivity, plus\n\n$13,400,000 lump sum for pain and suffering); Price, 384 F. Supp. 2d at 134–36 (awarding per\n\ndiem amount of $1,050,000 for 105 days in captivity, plus $7,500,000 lump sum for pain and\n\nsuffering).\n\n       Courts also developed a framework for awarding solatium damages to spouses and\n\nimmediate family members of those harmed by acts of state-sponsored terrorism. As a general\n\nmatter, “courts typically award between $8 million and $12 million for pain and suffering resulting\n\nfrom the death of a spouse.” Flanagan, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 117. In calculating awards for the loss\n\nof other family members, courts consider a variety of factors, including:\n\n               (1) whether the decedent’s death was sudden and unexpected;\n               (2) whether the death was attributable to negligence or malice;\n               (3) whether the claimants have sought medical treatment for\n               depression and related disorders resulting from the decedent’s death;\n               (4) the nature (i.e., closeness) of the relationship between the\n               claimant and the decedent; and (5) the duration of the claimants’\n               mental anguish in excess of that which would have been experienced\n               following the decedent’s natural death.\n\nStethem v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 89–90 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\f       The death of a spouse is undoubtedly one of the worst experiences in a person’s life, only\n\nmade more terrible by knowing the loved one’s life ended at the hands of violent terrorists. Judith\n\nJanis had an unquestionably close relationship with her husband Tom, as evidenced by more than\n\n30 years of marriage and a deep commitment to never spend more than 10 days apart. The pain\n\nand suffering she has experienced were magnified by the initial lack of information surrounding\n\nhis death: she learned her husband had gone missing over a voicemail; only determined he had\n\nbeen killed days later; and worked for years with the FBI to learn exactly what happened to her\n\nhusband. In light of these circumstances, the court awards Judith Janis $12,000,000 in solatium\n\ndamages. See Belkin, 667 F. Supp. 2d at 23 (collecting cases with similar awards); Valore, 700 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 85–86 (s).\n\n       The Janis children suffered a profound loss when the FARC murdered their father, the\n\nemotional effects of which remain ongoing. There is no question on this record whether Tom Janis\n\nhad a close and loving relationship with each of his children. Christopher, Greer, Michael, and\n\nJonathan each shared a special bond with their father and continue to mourn his death more than a\n\ndecade later. Tom Janis’s death was, indeed, sudden and unexpected—he was young, in good\n\nphysical shape, and had plans to visit his youngest son, Jonathan, in Florida. The children’s\n\nanguish at their father’s death was only exacerbated by the lack of information available; indeed,\n\nnone of the Janis children knew the full details of what happened to their father until Stansell,\n\nGonsalves, and Howes returned more than five years later. Moreover, the court does not doubt\n\nthat the manner of Tom Janis’s death—successfully crash-landing a plane under fire only to be\n\ntaken hostage and, some excruciating hours later, shot execution-style—adds to their pain and\n\nsuffering. Particular holidays and places perpetually remind the Janis children of the loss of not\n\nonly their father, but also the opportunity to share their lives with him. Their suffering has been\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fongoing and will continue for the rest of their adult lives. Thus, the court will award each of the\n\nJanis children $5,000,000 in solatium damages.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the court grants Plaintiffs’ Motion for Default Judgment.\n\nThe court enters judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and orders the Republic of Cuba to pay Keith\n\nStansell, Marc Gonsalves, and Thomas Howes $44,670,000 each in compensatory damages; Judith\n\nJanis $12,000,000 in solatium damages; and each of the Janis children $5,000,000 in solatium\n\ndamages.
