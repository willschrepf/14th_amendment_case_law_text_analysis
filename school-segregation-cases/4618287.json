Cayce\nKRISTAN SEIBERT,                                                     Clerk\n\n             Plaintiff - Appellant\n\nv.\n\nJACKSON COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI; JAMES MICHAEL BYRD, “Mike”\nIndividually and in His Official Capacity as Sheriff of Jackson County,\nMississippi,\n\n             Defendants - Appellees\n\n\n\n\n                Appeal from the United States District Court\n                  for the Southern District of Mississippi\n\n\nBefore DAVIS, DENNIS, and SOUTHWICK, Circuit Judges.\nJAMES L. DENNIS, Circuit Judge:\n      Kristan Seibert, a detective in the Jackson County, Mississippi, Sheriff’s\nDepartment, brought this lawsuit against former Sheriff James Michael Byrd\nand Jackson County. She assert claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nand under Mississippi tort law, including claims for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress (IIED). A jury found that the defendants were not liable\nunder Title VII; however, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $260,000\nagainst Byrd, in his individual capacity, on Seibert’s IIED claim. After final\njudgment was entered on the jury verdict, Byrd filed a renewed motion for\njudgment as a matter of law (JMOL), arguing that Seibert had presented\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788     Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\ninsufficient evidence to support the IIED verdict. Seibert filed a motion for\nJMOL; in the alternative, she requested a new trial. The district court granted\nByrd’s motion and denied Seibert’s motion. This appeal followed. Finding that\nthe district court erred in “decoupling” the evidence when considering Byrd’s\nmotion for JMOL, we reverse the district court’s judgment on that issue and\nremand for reinstatement of the jury’s verdict and entry of judgment thereon.\nFinding no further error, we affirm the district court’s judgment in all other\nrespects.\n                                        I\n      In November 2008, Kristan Seibert was hired by the Jackson County\nSheriff’s Department as a patrolman, under the supervision and management\nof Sheriff James Michael Byrd. In May 2012, then-Sheriff Byrd promoted\nSeibert and transferred her to the Explorers, a public relations and youth\noutreach program. In this position, she had more contact with the sheriff.\nSeibert alleges that Byrd began sexually harassing her shortly after her\ntransfer, subjecting her to “unwanted touching, lewd comments, and in general\nrude, unwelcome, and unwanted sexual advances toward her.”                Seibert\ndescribed these incidents in detail and testified that because of Byrd’s\ncontinued sexual harassment she felt “powerless.” In November 2012, Byrd\ntransferred Seibert to a different station on the west side of Jackson County.\nSeibert alleged that this transfer was retaliation for her refusal of his\nadvances; Byrd testified that it was an accommodation made to help Seibert\ncare for her sick child.\n      In August 2013, Seibert was called to testify before a Jackson County\nGrand Jury investigating Byrd, where she was questioned about his alleged\nsexual harassment.         After the grand jury returned an indictment and\ninformation about the proceedings was released, Seibert alleges that Byrd\ncame to her office and said, “I guess you hate me, too.” Byrd resigned from\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788      Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\noffice in December 2013, after he pleaded guilty to a federal felony charge of\nknowingly engaging in misleading conduct toward another person with intent\nto prevent the communication to a federal law enforcement officer. Later that\nmonth, Seibert filed a Charge of Discrimination against Byrd and Jackson\nCounty with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging\ndiscrimination based on sex and sexual harassment. She received a Notice of\nRight to Sue in January 2014. In April of the same year, Seibert filed suit in\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi,\nbringing claims against Byrd, in his official and individual capacities, and\nJackson County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a); and Mississippi tort law.\n      Byrd and the County filed separate motions to dismiss in June 2014. The\ndistrict court granted the motion as to Seibert’s official-capacity § 1983 claims\nand denied it in all other respects; the district court denied the County’s motion\nin its entirety. One year later, shortly before trial, Byrd and the County filed\nseparate motions for summary judgment.           The district court granted the\nmotions in part and denied the motions in part. The court granted Byrd’s\nmotion as to any Title VII claim against him in his individual capacity,\nSeibert’s retaliation and quid pro quo sexual harassment claims under Title\nVII, any purported state-law tort claim of sexual harassment, all claims for lost\nwages and lost earning capacity, and Seibert’s claim for punitive damages\nunder Title VII. The district court denied Byrd’s motion as to Seibert’s hostile\nwork environment claim under Title VII and her state-law claim of IIED. The\ncourt granted the County’s motion as to Seibert’s quid pro quo sexual\nharassment claim under § 1983, her claim for IIED against the County and\nByrd in his official capacity, any purported state-law tort claim of sexual\nharassment, all claims for punitive damages under § 1983 and state law, and\nany claims for lost wages and lost earning capacity. The district court denied\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 15-60884    Document: 00513913788     Page: 4   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-60884\nthe County’s motion with respect Seibert’s remaining Title VII claims, Seibert’s\nhostile work environment claim under § 1983, and Seibert’s claim for\nemotional damages under § 1983.\n      The trial commenced in September 2015.          Five witnesses testified:\nSeibert, James Mick Sears, Chad Powell, and Anthony Lawrence testified for\nthe plaintiff, and Mike Byrd testified for the defense. At the close of Seibert’s\ncase and again at the close of the evidence, Jackson County moved for JMOL\nas to Seibert’s claims against the County and Byrd, in his official capacity.\nByrd, in his individual capacity, also moved for JMOL on Seibert’s IIED claim.\nThe district court denied both Jackson County’s and Byrd’s motions.\n      After the three-day trial, the jury found that the defendants were not\nliable under Title VII; however, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of\n$260,000 against Byrd, in his individual capacity, on Seibert’s IIED claim.\nUpon entry of the final judgment, Byrd, in his individual capacity, filed a\nmotion for JMOL, or in the alternative for a new trial, on Seibert’s IIED claim,\narguing that Seibert had presented insufficient evidence to support the IIED\nverdict. Seibert filed a motion for JMOL on her Title VII harassment claim,\narguing that the evidence at trial pointed so strongly and overwhelmingly in\nher favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary conclusion with\nregard to the Title VII claims. In the alternative, she requested a new trial on\nthe grounds that verdict was against the weight of the evidence; that the\nverdict was inconsistent; and that the jury instructions were improper. She\nalso sought JMOL or a new trial on her quid pro quo claim. On December 9,\n2015, the district court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting\nByrd’s motion and denying Seibert’s motion; Seibert timely appealed.\n                                       II\n      Seibert argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for\nJMOL as to her Title VII hostile work environment claim; in granting Byrd’s\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788      Page: 5    Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\nmotion for JMOL as to her IIED claim; in denying her motion for a new trial\non her hostile work environment claim; and in granting Bryd’s and the\nCounty’s motions for summary judgment on her quid pro quo claim.\n                                         A\n       “We review de novo the district court’s denial of a motion for judgment\nas a matter of law, applying the same standard as the district court.” Foradori\nv. Harris, 523 F.3d 477, 485 (5th Cir. 2008). A JMOL is appropriate when “a\nreasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for\nthe [non-moving] party on that issue.” FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a). “When a case is\ntried to a jury, a motion for judgment as a matter of law ‘is a challenge to the\nlegal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict.’” Cowart v.\nErwin, 837 F.3d 444, 450 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Heck v. Triche, 775 F.3d 265,\n272 (5th Cir. 2014)).      In resolving such challenges, we must draw “all\nreasonable inferences and resolve all credibility determinations in the light\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party” and uphold the verdict “unless there\nis no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find as the jury\ndid.” Id. (quoting Heck, 775 F.3d at 273).\n      However, “[c]hallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must be raised\nin a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw before submission of the case to the jury.” Stover v. Hattiesburg Pub. Sch.\nDist., 549 F.3d 985, 995 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States ex rel. Wallace\nv. Flintco, Inc., 143 F.3d 955, 960 (5th Cir. 1998)). Where a party failed to raise\na Rule 50 motion for JMOL before the case went to a jury, this court considers\nthe sufficiency of the evidence under a plain error standard of review. Id.\nUnder the plain error standard, we will reverse “only if the judgment\ncomplained of results in a ‘manifest miscarriage of justice.’”        Id. (quoting\nFlintco, 143 F.3d at 963-64).\n\n\n                                         5\n\f    Case: 15-60884    Document: 00513913788     Page: 6   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-60884\n      Unlike Byrd and the County, Seibert did not move for JMOL before the\ncase went to the jury. Seibert does not deny this on appeal. Instead, she argues\nthat her failure constitutes “technical noncompliance with Rule 50” that should\nbe excused. Seibert points to MacArthur v. University of Texas Health Center,\n45 F.3d 890, 896 (5th Cir. 1995), in which we observed, “In certain limited\nsituations . . . we have excused technical non-compliance with Rule 50(b).” She\ndoes not, however, explain how her failure to move for JMOL at any point\nbefore the case was submitted to the jury amounts to only “technical”\nnoncompliance, nor does she demonstrate that her case meets the strict\nlimitations outlined in MacArthur.\n      In MacArthur, we explained, “Whether technical noncompliance with\nRule 50(b) precludes a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal\n‘should be examined in the light of the accomplishment of its particular\npurposes as well as in the general context of securing a fair trial for all\nconcerned in the quest for truth.’” Id. (quoting Bohrer v. Hanes Corp., 715 F.2d\n213, 217 (5th Cir. 1983)). But in both MacArthur and Bohrer, we considered\nsituations in which noncompliance was truly technical: in both cases, the\ndistrict court had reserved ruling on a defendant’s motion for directed verdict\nmade at the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, but the defendant had failed to\nmake a renewed motion at the conclusion of all the evidence. Id. at 897; Bohrer,\n715 F.2d at 217. Here, no motion was taken under advisement; neither the\ncourt nor the defendants were put on notice that a challenge to the sufficiency\nof the evidence was forthcoming.\n      In Delano-Pyle v. Victoria County, Texas, 302 F.3d 567, 572-73 (5th Cir.\n2002), we reiterated the limits of the exception recognized in Bohrer and\nMacArthur:\n      Generally, . . . we have only excused departures from Rule 50(b)\n      where the trial court had taken under advisement an earlier\n\n                                       6\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788      Page: 7   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\n      motion for directed verdict, which was made after the plaintiff\n      rested; the defendant presented no more than two witnesses prior\n      to closing; only a few minutes elapsed from the time the motion for\n      directed verdict was made and the conclusion of all the evidence;\n      and no rebuttal evidence was introduced by the plaintiff.\nWe concluded, “In the absence of the circumstances stated above, we have\nfound that the purposes of the rule have not been satisfied, and therefore, the\ncomplaining party has waived its right to contest the jury’s verdict on\nsufficiency of the evidence grounds.” Id. at 573. Because Seibert wholly failed\nto move for JMOL before the case went to the jury, plain error review applies.\n      “On plain error review ‘the question before this Court is not whether\nthere was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict, but whether there\nwas any evidence to support the jury verdict.’” Id. (quoting McCann v. Tex.\nCity Refining, Inc., 984 F.2d 667, 673 (5th Cir. 1993)).        “If any evidence\nsupports the jury verdict, the verdict will be upheld.” Id. (quoting Flintco, 143\nF.3d at 964). In this case, there was some evidence to support the jury’s verdict\non Seibert’s Title VII claims: Byrd testified at trial and denied all of the\nallegations made against him. Because some evidence supports the jury’s\nverdict, the district court did not plainly err in denying Seibert’s Rule 50\nmotion. Stover, 549 F.3d at 995.\n                                        B\n      We review the district court’s decision to grant a motion for JMOL de\nnovo. Weiser-Brown Operating Co. v. St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 801 F.3d\n512, 525 (5th Cir. 2015) (citing DP Solutions, Inc. v. Rollins, Inc., 353 F.3d 421,\n427 (5th Cir. 2003)). JMOL is only appropriate when “a party has been fully\nheard on an issue during a jury trial and . . . a reasonable jury would not have\na legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.” FED.\nR. CIV. P. 50(a)(1). The court must “consider all of the evidence, drawing all\nreasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in the light\n\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 15-60884      Document: 00513913788   Page: 8   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-60884\nmost favorable to the non-moving party.” Flowers v. S. Reg’l Physician Servs.\nInc., 247 F.3d 229, 235 (quoting Brown v. Bryan County, OK., 219 F.3d 450,\n456 (5th Cir. 2000)).\n      Moving for JMOL, Byrd argued, “In light of the jury’s finding that Byrd\ndid not sexually harass the Plaintiff, there was clearly insufficient evidence\nupon which the jury could find that Byrd was liable for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress.” Granting the motion, the district court adopted Byrd’s\nlogic: rather than considering all of the evidence that had been presented to\nthe jury, the district court focused exclusively on evidence of non-sexual\nharassment, i.e., Byrd’s alleged retaliation for Seibert’s grand jury testimony.\nThe district court concluded:\n      No rational juror could view the evidence and conclude that\n      Defendant Byrd’s visit to Plaintiff’s office after her grand jury\n      testimony – particularly when decoupled from the evidence of\n      sexual harassment which the jury apparently disbelieved – was “so\n      outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond\n      all bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly\n      intolerable in a civilized community.”\n(Quoting Bowden v. Young, 120 So. 3d 971, 980 (Miss. 2013)). On appeal, Byrd\ndefends the district court’s “decoupling” of the evidence by pointing to this\ncourt’s decision in Carroll v. Hoechst Celenese Corp., 204 F.3d 1118 (5th Cir.\n1999) (unpublished).\n      In Carroll, as in this case, the plaintiff brought claims under Title VII\nand under state law for IIED. Id. at *1. The jury returned a verdict finding\nthat defendant Hoechst Celenese Corporation (HCC) had violated Title VII,\nbut that Carroll did not prove individual damages resulting from the violation;\nthe jury also found HCC liable for IIED and awarded Carroll $250,000 in\ncompensatory and punitive damages. Id. at *1. Carroll moved for a new trial\non issue of the absence of damages for the Title VII violation. Id. at *4. The\n\n\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788     Page: 9   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\ndistrict court denied the motion. Id. HCC moved for JMOL on, inter alia, the\nIIED claim; the district court denied that motion as well. Id.\n      This court affirmed the denial of a new trial but reversed the denial of\nJMOL. Id. at *9. Affirming denial of Carroll’s motion for a new trial, we agreed\nwith the district court that there was “at least one logical interpretation of the\njury’s award: it believed that the injury suffered by Carroll was the result of\nacts which constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress yet which did\nnot constitute sexual harassment.” Id. at *2; *8.\n      Because the Carroll court reconciled the two verdicts by supposing that\nthe jury may have considered non-sexual conduct in returning the verdict for\nIIED, Byrd interprets Carroll to “indicat[e] approval for the type of analysis\nthat the district court applied [in this case].” This interpretation is plainly\nflawed.   The Carroll court did not refuse to consider evidence that was\ninconsistent with the jury’s denial of damages for the Title VII violation;\ninstead, it attempted to reconcile the two verdicts using all of the evidence\npresented. A more analogous analysis for purposes of the present case would\nbe to assume that the jury credited Seibert’s testimony about Byrd’s sexual\nbehavior, but conclude that it determined that she had failed, for some other\nreason, to establish that Byrd’s actions met the legal definition of sexual\nharassment. To prevail on a sexual harassment-based claim of hostile work\nenvironment against a supervisor under Title VII, an employee must prove:\n“(1) that the employee belongs to a protected class; (2) that the employee was\nsubject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the harassment was based\non sex; and (4) that the harassment affected a ‘term, condition, or privilege’ of\nemployment.” Lauderdale v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice, Inst’l Div., 512\nF.3d 157, 163 (5th Cir. 2007). The jury thus could have believed that Byrd\nsubjected Seibert to unwelcome sexual harassment but concluded that this\nharassment did not affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment.\n                                        9\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788       Page: 10    Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-60884\n      By decoupling the evidence and considering only testimony that related\nto nonsexual conduct, the district court plainly ignored this court’s direction to\n“consider all of the evidence, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving\nall credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty.” Flowers, 247 F.3d at 235. This error, however, is not dispositive, as we\n“will affirm the district court if the result is correct, ‘even if . . . affirmance is\nupon grounds not relied upon by the district court.’” Weiser-Brown, 801 F.3d\nat 525 (quoting Foreman v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 117 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir.\n1997)). It is therefore necessary to determine whether, considering all of the\nevidence, “the facts and inferences point ‘so strongly and overwhelmingly in\n[Byrd’s] favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary conclusion.’”\nFlowers, 247 F.3d at 235 (quoting Omnitech Int’l, Inc. v.

Fluor Daniel Servs. Corp.,\n959 So. 2d 1044, 1048 (Miss. 2007). On the other hand, conduct that does not\nrise to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress includes “such\nactions as a law firm breaching an employment contract with an attorney,\nlocking him out, refusing him secretarial support and dropping his name from\nthe firm sign,” Speed v. Scott, 787 So.2d 626, 630 (Miss. 2001), and an\nemployer’s attempts “to force [an employee] to quit his job as a security officer\nby giving him a grueling work schedule,” Roebuck v. Dothan Sec., Inc., 515 F.\nApp’x 275, 278 (5th Cir. 2013).\n      Here, considering all of the evidence, the facts and inferences do not\npoint “so strongly and overwhelmingly” in Byrd’s favor that reasonable jurors\ncould not return a verdict finding him liable for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress. Flowers, 247 F.3d at 235. Crediting Seibert’s testimony,\nreasonable jurors could believe that, over the course of several months, Byrd\nput his face close to Seibert’s and said, “You know you want to kiss me”; put\nhis hand on the inside of her leg and said, “I want to taste your pussy”; touched\nher buttocks; repeatedly asked her, “When are we going to get together?”;\nreminded her, “I gave you sergeant and I can take it away” when she refused\nhis advances; and moved her office closer to his to give him “easier access” to\nher. The allegations of continual, persistent sexual harassment in this case\nare not allegations of unfair employment decisions like those at issue in Speed\nand Roebuck; they are far more analogous to the allegations of sustained racial\nharassment in Jones. Indeed, a reasonable jury could fairly conclude that Byrd\nsubjected Seibert to “a pattern of deliberate, repeated harassment over a period\nof time,” Lee, 797 So.2d at 851, that constituted intentional, outrageous\n                                       11\n\f   Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788      Page: 12   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\nconduct, see Prunty v. Ark. Freightways, Inc., 16 F.3d 649, 654 (5th Cir. 1994)\n(manager’s continued sexual harassment of employee was extreme and\noutrageous).\n      Because a reasonable jury would have a legally sufficient evidentiary\nbasis to find for Seibert on the issue of IIED, we find that the district court\nerred in granting Byrd’s motion for JMOL. FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1).\n                                        C\n      A district court has discretion to grant a new trial under Rule 59(a) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when it is necessary to do so “to prevent\nan injustice.” United States v. Flores, 981 F.2d 231, 237 (5th Cir. 1993). The\ndecision to grant or deny a motion for new trial is a matter for the trial court’s\ndiscretion; we will reverse its ruling only for an abuse of that discretion.\nTreadaway v. Societe Anonyme Louis-Dreyfus, 894 F.2d 161, 164 (5th Cir.\n1990). “Absent ‘a clear showing of an abuse of discretion,’ we will not reverse\nthe trial court’s decision to deny a new trial.” Duff v. Werner Enterprises, Inc.,\n489 F.3d 727, 729 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Hidden Oaks Ltd. v. City of Austin,\n138 F.3d 1036, 1049 (5th Cir. 1998)). As to all three of her arguments, Seibert\nfails to meet this heightened burden.\n      Under our precedent, “[a] trial court should not grant a new trial on\nevidentiary grounds unless the verdict is against the great weight of the\nevidence.” Whitehead v. Food Max of Miss., Inc., 163 F.3d 265, 269 (5th Cir.\n1998). In other words, the movant must show “an absolute absence of evidence\nto support the jury’s verdict.” Id. As previously noted, here there was some\nevidence to support the jury’s verdict on Seibert’s Title VII claims: Byrd\ntestified at trial and denied all of the allegations made against him. The fact\nthat the jury found in Seibert’s favor on her intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress claim has no bearing; as explained above, the jury could have believed\nthat Byrd subjected Seibert to unwelcome sexual harassment but concluded\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788       Page: 13    Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-60884\nthat this harassment did not affect a term, condition, or privilege of\nemployment. See Lauderdale, 512 F.3d at 163.\n      For the same reason, the jury’s verdict was not inconsistent—there is a\nlogical way to reconcile the jury’s finding of liability on the intentional infliction\nof emotional distress claim with the finding of no liability on the Title VII\nclaim. See Willard v. The John Hayward, 577 F.2d 1009, 1011 (5th Cir. 1978)\n(“Answers [to special interrogatories] should be considered inconsistent . . .\nonly if there is no way to reconcile them.”).\n      Finally, Seibert has failed to demonstrate that the district court\nincorrectly instructed the jury on the applicable law. Seibert did not appeal\nthe district court’s refusal to issue her requested jury instruction. Nor does\nshe argue that the jury was actually incorrectly instructed on the law of\nmunicipal liability. Instead, she claims that she offered a “similar, but clearer”\ninstruction on this issue, and that “the jury was left confused about these\nissues and the law related thereto.” The district court did not clearly abuse its\ndiscretion by refusing to grant a new trial on the grounds that a jury\ninstruction, although correct, was not as clear as it could have been. See United\nStates v. Ramos, 537 F.3d 439, 465 (5th Cir. 2008) (“To the extent that the\ndefendants argue that the instructions could have better explicated the theory\nof the defense, they are not entitled to a preferred wording in the jury\ninstructions.”); Cf. Baisden v. I’m Ready Prods., Inc., 693 F.3d 491, 505 (5th\nCir. 2012) (district court’s refusal to give requested instruction is reversible\nerror if it (1) was a substantially correct statement of law; (2) was not\nsubstantially covered in charge as a whole; and (3) concerned an important\npoint in trial), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 1585 (2013).\n                                          D\n       Seibert argues that the district court erred in granting Byrd’s and the\nCounty’s motions for summary judgment on her quid pro quo harassment\n                                         13\n\f    Case: 15-60884       Document: 00513913788    Page: 14   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-60884\nclaim. In the district court’s December 9 Memorandum Opinion and Order,\nthe district court considered Seibert’s motion for JMOL or, alternatively, a new\ntrial as to her quid pro quo harassment claim; the court concluded that Seibert\nwaived that claim when she failed to list it in the pretrial order. See, e.g., Am.\nRice, Inc. v. Producers Rice Mill, Inc., 518 F.3d 321, 335 (5th Cir. 2008) (“If a\nclaim or issue is omitted from the [pretrial] order, it is waived.” (alteration in\noriginal) (citation omitted)); Elvis Presley Enterprises, Inc. v. Capece, 141 F.3d\n188, 206 (5th Cir. 1998) (“Once the pretrial order is entered, it controls the\ncourse and scope of the proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n16(e), and if a claim or issue is omitted from the order, it is waived, even if it\nappeared in the complaint.”). In her opening brief Seibert did not challenge\nthis conclusion, and in her reply brief she fails to discuss her quid pro quo\nclaim. We must therefore determine that any argument relating to this claim\nis forfeited. FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(8)(A).\n                                        III\n      Because that the district court erred in “decoupling” the evidence when\nconsidering Byrd’s motion for JMOL, we REVERSE the district court’s\njudgment on that issue and REMAND for reinstatement of the jury’s verdict\nand entry of judgment thereon. The district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED\nin all other respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f",

DENNIS, Circuit Judge:\n      Kristan Seibert, a detective in the Jackson County, Mississippi, Sheriff’s\nDepartment, brought this lawsuit against former Sheriff James Michael Byrd\nand Jackson County. She assert claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nand under Mississippi tort law, including claims for intentional infliction of\nemotional distress (IIED). A jury found that the defendants were not liable\nunder Title VII; however, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of $260,000\nagainst Byrd, in his individual capacity, on Seibert’s IIED claim. After final\njudgment was entered on the jury verdict, Byrd filed a renewed motion for\njudgment as a matter of law (JMOL), arguing that Seibert had presented\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788     Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\ninsufficient evidence to support the IIED verdict. Seibert filed a motion for\nJMOL; in the alternative, she requested a new trial. The district court granted\nByrd’s motion and denied Seibert’s motion. This appeal followed. Finding that\nthe district court erred in “decoupling” the evidence when considering Byrd’s\nmotion for JMOL, we reverse the district court’s judgment on that issue and\nremand for reinstatement of the jury’s verdict and entry of judgment thereon.\nFinding no further error, we affirm the district court’s judgment in all other\nrespects.\n                                        I\n      In November 2008, Kristan Seibert was hired by the Jackson County\nSheriff’s Department as a patrolman, under the supervision and management\nof Sheriff James Michael Byrd. In May 2012, then-Sheriff Byrd promoted\nSeibert and transferred her to the Explorers, a public relations and youth\noutreach program. In this position, she had more contact with the sheriff.\nSeibert alleges that Byrd began sexually harassing her shortly after her\ntransfer, subjecting her to “unwanted touching, lewd comments, and in general\nrude, unwelcome, and unwanted sexual advances toward her.”                Seibert\ndescribed these incidents in detail and testified that because of Byrd’s\ncontinued sexual harassment she felt “powerless.” In November 2012, Byrd\ntransferred Seibert to a different station on the west side of Jackson County.\nSeibert alleged that this transfer was retaliation for her refusal of his\nadvances; Byrd testified that it was an accommodation made to help Seibert\ncare for her sick child.\n      In August 2013, Seibert was called to testify before a Jackson County\nGrand Jury investigating Byrd, where she was questioned about his alleged\nsexual harassment.         After the grand jury returned an indictment and\ninformation about the proceedings was released, Seibert alleges that Byrd\ncame to her office and said, “I guess you hate me, too.” Byrd resigned from\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788      Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\noffice in December 2013, after he pleaded guilty to a federal felony charge of\nknowingly engaging in misleading conduct toward another person with intent\nto prevent the communication to a federal law enforcement officer. Later that\nmonth, Seibert filed a Charge of Discrimination against Byrd and Jackson\nCounty with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging\ndiscrimination based on sex and sexual harassment. She received a Notice of\nRight to Sue in January 2014. In April of the same year, Seibert filed suit in\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi,\nbringing claims against Byrd, in his official and individual capacities, and\nJackson County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a); and Mississippi tort law.\n      Byrd and the County filed separate motions to dismiss in June 2014. The\ndistrict court granted the motion as to Seibert’s official-capacity § 1983 claims\nand denied it in all other respects; the district court denied the County’s motion\nin its entirety. One year later, shortly before trial, Byrd and the County filed\nseparate motions for summary judgment.           The district court granted the\nmotions in part and denied the motions in part. The court granted Byrd’s\nmotion as to any Title VII claim against him in his individual capacity,\nSeibert’s retaliation and quid pro quo sexual harassment claims under Title\nVII, any purported state-law tort claim of sexual harassment, all claims for lost\nwages and lost earning capacity, and Seibert’s claim for punitive damages\nunder Title VII. The district court denied Byrd’s motion as to Seibert’s hostile\nwork environment claim under Title VII and her state-law claim of IIED. The\ncourt granted the County’s motion as to Seibert’s quid pro quo sexual\nharassment claim under § 1983, her claim for IIED against the County and\nByrd in his official capacity, any purported state-law tort claim of sexual\nharassment, all claims for punitive damages under § 1983 and state law, and\nany claims for lost wages and lost earning capacity. The district court denied\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 15-60884    Document: 00513913788     Page: 4   Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-60884\nthe County’s motion with respect Seibert’s remaining Title VII claims, Seibert’s\nhostile work environment claim under § 1983, and Seibert’s claim for\nemotional damages under § 1983.\n      The trial commenced in September 2015.          Five witnesses testified:\nSeibert, James Mick Sears, Chad Powell, and Anthony Lawrence testified for\nthe plaintiff, and Mike Byrd testified for the defense. At the close of Seibert’s\ncase and again at the close of the evidence, Jackson County moved for JMOL\nas to Seibert’s claims against the County and Byrd, in his official capacity.\nByrd, in his individual capacity, also moved for JMOL on Seibert’s IIED claim.\nThe district court denied both Jackson County’s and Byrd’s motions.\n      After the three-day trial, the jury found that the defendants were not\nliable under Title VII; however, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of\n$260,000 against Byrd, in his individual capacity, on Seibert’s IIED claim.\nUpon entry of the final judgment, Byrd, in his individual capacity, filed a\nmotion for JMOL, or in the alternative for a new trial, on Seibert’s IIED claim,\narguing that Seibert had presented insufficient evidence to support the IIED\nverdict. Seibert filed a motion for JMOL on her Title VII harassment claim,\narguing that the evidence at trial pointed so strongly and overwhelmingly in\nher favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary conclusion with\nregard to the Title VII claims. In the alternative, she requested a new trial on\nthe grounds that verdict was against the weight of the evidence; that the\nverdict was inconsistent; and that the jury instructions were improper. She\nalso sought JMOL or a new trial on her quid pro quo claim. On December 9,\n2015, the district court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting\nByrd’s motion and denying Seibert’s motion; Seibert timely appealed.\n                                       II\n      Seibert argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for\nJMOL as to her Title VII hostile work environment claim; in granting Byrd’s\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788      Page: 5    Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-60884\nmotion for JMOL as to her IIED claim; in denying her motion for a new trial\non her hostile work environment claim; and in granting Bryd’s and the\nCounty’s motions for summary judgment on her quid pro quo claim.\n                                         A\n       “We review de novo the district court’s denial of a motion for judgment\nas a matter of law, applying the same standard as the district court.” Foradori\nv.

Id. at *1. The jury returned a verdict finding\nthat defendant Hoechst Celenese Corporation (HCC) had violated Title VII,\nbut that Carroll did not prove individual damages resulting from the violation;\nthe jury also found HCC liable for IIED and awarded Carroll $250,000 in\ncompensatory and punitive damages.

Id. HCC moved for JMOL on, inter alia, the\nIIED claim; the district court denied that motion as well. Id.\n      This court affirmed the denial of a new trial but reversed the denial of\nJMOL. Id. at *9. Affirming denial of Carroll’s motion for a new trial, we agreed\nwith the district court that there was “at least one logical interpretation of the\njury’s award: it believed that the injury suffered by Carroll was the result of\nacts which constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress yet which did\nnot constitute sexual harassment.” Id. at *2; *8.\n      Because the Carroll court reconciled the two verdicts by supposing that\nthe jury may have considered non-sexual conduct in returning the verdict for\nIIED, Byrd interprets Carroll to “indicat[e] approval for the type of analysis\nthat the district court applied [in this case].” This interpretation is plainly\nflawed.   The Carroll court did not refuse to consider evidence that was\ninconsistent with the jury’s denial of damages for the Title VII violation;\ninstead, it attempted to reconcile the two verdicts using all of the evidence\npresented. A more analogous analysis for purposes of the present case would\nbe to assume that the jury credited Seibert’s testimony about Byrd’s sexual\nbehavior, but conclude that it determined that she had failed, for some other\nreason, to establish that Byrd’s actions met the legal definition of sexual\nharassment. To prevail on a sexual harassment-based claim of hostile work\nenvironment against a supervisor under Title VII, an employee must prove:\n“(1) that the employee belongs to a protected class; (2) that the employee was\nsubject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the harassment was based\non sex; and (4) that the harassment affected a ‘term, condition, or privilege’ of\nemployment.” Lauderdale v.

The allegations of continual, persistent sexual harassment in this case\nare not allegations of unfair employment decisions like those at issue in Speed\nand Roebuck; they are far more analogous to the allegations of sustained racial\nharassment in Jones.

The fact\nthat the jury found in Seibert’s favor on her intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress claim has no bearing; as explained above, the jury could have believed\nthat Byrd subjected Seibert to unwelcome sexual harassment but concluded\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 15-60884     Document: 00513913788       Page: 13    Date Filed: 03/15/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-60884\nthat this harassment did not affect a term, condition, or privilege of\nemployment.

In the district court’s December 9 Memorandum Opinion and Order,\nthe district court considered Seibert’s motion for JMOL or, alternatively, a new\ntrial as to her quid pro quo harassment claim; the court concluded that Seibert\nwaived that claim when she failed to list it in the pretrial order.

In her opening brief Seibert did not challenge\nthis conclusion, and in her reply brief she fails to discuss her quid pro quo\nclaim. We must therefore determine that any argument relating to this claim\nis forfeited. FED. R. APP.
