Those appeals were from orders of the bankruptcy court\nwhich 1) denied the Trustees' Renewed Motion for adequate\nprotection, 2) confirmed Continental's revised second amended\njoint plan of reorganization, and 3) denied the Trustees' motion\nfor the establishment of a cash deposit of $123,479,287. In\nessence, the Appellant Trustees seek payment for an asserted\nadministrative claim of approximately $117 million against the\nreorganized company. The Appellee, Continental Airlines, Inc.,\ndefends the district court's decision to dismiss the Trustees'\nappeal and argues, in the alternative, that the underlying\n\frulings of the bankruptcy court were correct as a matter of law\nand fact.\n                               I.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n         Continental filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on\nDecember 3, 1990. Appellant Trustees serve as successor\nCollateral and Series Trustees for certificate holders who had\nprovided Continental with operating capital. The certificates\nwere secured at the time of Continental's petition by a pool of\n29 commercial aircraft with engines, and 81 additional jet\nengines which, we were advised, serviced about one-third of\nContinental's operating fleet. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the\ndebtor in possession, which has most of the rights, powers,\nfunctions and duties of a trustee, see 11 U.S.C.   1107(a), \"may\nuse property of the estate in the ordinary course of business\nwithout notice or a hearing.\" 11 U.S.C.    363(c)(1).\n         Section 363(e) provides:\n         Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at\n         any time, on request of an entity that has an interest\n         in property used . . . by the [debtor in possession],\n         the court, with or without a hearing, shall prohibit or\n         condition such use . . . as is necessary to provide\n         adequate protection of such interest.\n11 U.S.C.   363(e).\n         On February 21, 1991, First Fidelity Bank of New\nJersey, predecessor to NationsBank as Collateral Trustee, filed a\nmotion along with many other aircraft lessors and financiers\nalleging, inter alia, a decline in the value of the collateral\nand seeking adequate protection under section 363(e). First\nFidelity later withdrew from this motion, but on June 28, 1991\nit, and the predecessors of the other Appellant Trustees, filed a\nmotion seeking similar relief. The bankruptcy court held an\nevidentiary hearing on the motion from September 3 through\nSeptember 6, 1991 limited to the Trustees' assertion that they\nwere entitled to adequate protection payments as a result of the\ncollateral's post-petition decline in market value.\n         Continental argued, inter alia, that because the\nTrustees had not filed a motion for relief from the automatic\nstay, they were not entitled to an award of adequate protection\nunder section 363(e). The motion remained pending in the\nbankruptcy court until August 27, 1992 when the court ruled on\nthe Trustees' motion, rejecting Continental's legal argument but\nfinding as a fact, based on the \"Blue Books,\" a publication\nissued by a company that appraises aircraft, that the market\nvalue of the collateral had not declined during the period at\nissue in the motion. In re Continental Airlines, Inc., 146 B.R.\n536 (Bankr. D. Del. 1992) [hereinafter Continental I].\n         Approximately two weeks before the bankruptcy court\nissued that opinion, the Trustees filed their first motion under\nsection 362(d) of the Bankruptcy Code to lift the automatic stay\n(\"Lift-Stay Motion\"). See 11 U.S.C.    362(d). This section\npermits a creditor to move for relief from the automatic stay of\ndelineated activities, such as repossession of collateral,\neffected by section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\f         On September 14, 1992, the Trustees also filed a\nrenewed motion for adequate protection for alleged decline in the\ncollateral's value for the period after September 1991, when the\noriginal 1991 motion was argued (\"Renewed Motion\"). There were\nvarious hearings on the Renewed Motion between November 3, 1992\nand February 5, 1993. Toward the end of that period, the\nTrustees filed a motion dated January 29, 1993, asking the\nbankruptcy court to establish a cash deposit of some $123\nmillion, of which $117 million was attributable to alleged market\ndecline, to preserve what the Trustees claimed was the\nadministrative priority status of the Trustees' adequate\nprotection claim if Continental emerged from bankruptcy as a\nreorganized debtor (\"Deposit Motion\").\n         During this period efforts to reorganize the debtor\ncontinued. On November 9, 1992 Continental entered into an\nInvestment Agreement under which the Investors (Air Partners,\nL.P. and Air Canada) agreed and committed to an investment of\n$450 million in the reorganized entity under a complex\narrangement and subject to certain conditions. App. at 391 et\nseq. One of those conditions, and the one most relevant to this\nproceeding, was a limitation on the amount and nature of\nliabilities and administrative expense claims required to be\nassumed by or attributable to the reorganized company. App. at\n408. On January 13, 1993 Continental filed a second amended\njoint plan of reorganization (\"Plan\") which referenced that\nInvestment Agreement. The Plan provided, inter alia, for\nassumption of \"allowed administrative claims\" by the reorganized\nContinental. App. at 656.\n         The confirmation hearing was held for a number of days\nduring the period March 16, 1993 through April 16, 1993. The\nparties reached a settlement on April 12 concerning adequate\nprotection due to use and/or maintenance of the collateral by\nContinental, and no issue relating to use decline (the impairment\nin value attributable to the use of the collateral by the debtor\nin possession) is before us. However, the parties did not settle\nthe Trustees' adequate protection claims based on decline in\nmarket value.\n         At the conclusion of the confirmation hearing on April\n16, 1993, the bankruptcy court denied the Deposit Motion and the\nRenewed Motion. In a published opinion, the bankruptcy court\nheld that it was necessary for the Trustees to have sought relief\nfrom the automatic stay to be entitled to adequate protection for\nmarket value decline; that therefore the Trustees were not\nentitled to adequate protection due to market decline until after\nthe date of their Lift-Stay Motion, i.e. August 14, 1992; and\nthat no decline in the market value of the collateral had taken\nplace since that date. In re Continental Airlines, Inc., 154\nB.R. 176 (Bankr. D. Del. 1993) [hereinafter Continental II].\nAlso on April 16, 1993, the bankruptcy court signed the\nConfirmation Order. The court made a series of detailed findings\nof fact and conclusions of law underlying the Confirmation Order\nwhich will be referred to throughout this opinion when pertinent.\n         On April 20, 1993 the Trustees filed three notices of\n\fappeal to the district court from the bankruptcy court's denial\nof the Renewed Motion for Adequate Protection, its denial of the\nDeposit Motion, and its order confirming the Plan. Two days\nlater, the Trustees filed a motion for a partial stay of the\nconsummation of the Plan (\"Conditional Stay Motion\"), but filed\nthat motion in the district court, which referred them to the\nbankruptcy court. On April 26, 1993, the Trustees filed that\nstay request in the bankruptcy court. Because the bankruptcy\njudge was not available, the hearing on the motion was held the\nnext day in the district court, which stated, without explanation\nor analysis, that the Trustees were likely to prevail on their\nappeal to the district court, but denied the stay because the\n\nTrustees were \"unable to post a bond satisfactory to the Court.\"\nApp. at 1755-56. The Trustees did not then make any effort to\nseek any emergency relief from this court. With no stay impeding\nimplementation of the Plan which had now been confirmed, the\nInvestors proceeded to close the transaction by making their\npromised investment.\n         On May 6, 1993 Continental filed a motion in the\ndistrict court to dismiss the Trustees' appeals as moot, which\nthe district court granted on December 30, 1993. The Trustees\nfiled a motion for rehearing and reconsideration in light of the\ndecision in Frito-Lay, Inc. v. LTV Steel Co., Inc. (In re\nChateaugay Corp.), 10 F.3d 944 (2d Cir. 1993) [hereinafter\nChateaugay II], which the court denied. The Trustees then filed\na timely notice of appeal. This court has jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C.   158(d).\n         A panel of this court heard argument on September 15,\n1995 and issued an opinion that affirmed the district court's\norder by a two-to-one vote. The Trustees petitioned for\nrehearing, and the in banc court voted to rehear the appeal.\nUnder this court's Internal Operating Procedures, the opinion of\nthe panel issued February 7, 1996 was withdrawn.\n\n                               II.\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                A.\n         This court has not addressed the interesting and\nchallenging questions raised by the bankruptcy court's holding\nthat a creditor must file a motion to lift the automatic stay as\na prerequisite to seeking adequate protection. The Trustees\nargue that the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law and that\nthis court can decide the issue de novo even though it was not\nreached by the district court. They further argue that the\nbankruptcy court's finding that there was no diminution in the\nmarket value of the Trustees' collateral after they filed their\nLift-Stay Motion was clearly erroneous. Finally, they argue that\nthe bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law in denying their\nmotion for the establishment of a cash deposit.\n         Not surprisingly, Continental, as appellee, defends\nboth the bankruptcy court's legal determination that the Trustees\ncould not assert adequate protection claims for alleged market\nvalue decline during the period before they moved for relief from\n\fthe automatic stay and its factual conclusion that there had been\nno substantial decline in the value of the collateral since the\nLift-Stay Motion was filed. Finally, it argues that in any event\nthe Trustees could not recover for adequate protection because\nthe value of the collateral did not decline below its value on\nthe petition date, which Continental contends is the relevant\nmeasure.\n         We would reach these issues only if we were satisfied\nthat the district court erred in holding that the Trustees'\nappeals to it were \"moot,\" a decision as to which the parties\nvigorously disagree. Mootness vel non of the appeals before the\ndistrict court is closely related to, if not indistinguishable\nfrom, the question whether the appeal to this court is moot, an\nissue which Continental alludes to in its brief. For\nconvenience, we will refer to mootness in the district court\nunless we state otherwise.\n         Continental does not contend that the appeals to the\ndistrict court or to us were moot in the constitutional sense,\nimplicating the case or controversy requirement of Article III,\n1. See, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401-02 (1975).\nThis is not a situation analogous to those where the Supreme\nCourt determined that the appeals became moot because the law at\nissue was repealed, see Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church,\n404 U.S. 412, 414-15 (1972); the subject of the election campaign\ncontroversy was no longer a candidate, see Golden v. Zwickler,\n394 U.S. 103, 109-10 (1969); or the railroad whose application\nfor tariffs was contested withdrew that application, see A.L.\nMechling Barge Lines, Inc. v. United States, 368 U.S. 324, 329-30\n(1961).\n         Indeed, as the Supreme Court has recently explained, an\nappeal is moot in the constitutional sense only if events have\ntaken place during the pendency of the appeal that make it\n\"impossible for the court to grant 'any effectual relief\nwhatever.'\" Church of Scientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9,\n12, 113 S. Ct. 447, 449 (1992) (quoting Mills v. Green, 159 U.S.\n651, 653 (1895)). An appeal is not moot \"merely because a court\ncannot restore the parties to the status quo ante. Rather, when\na court can fashion 'some form of meaningful relief,' even if it\nonly partially redresses the grievances of the prevailing party,\nthe appeal is not moot.\" RTC v. Swedeland Dev. Group, Inc. (In\nre Swedeland Dev. Group, Inc.), 16 F.3d 552, 560 (3d Cir. 1994)\n(in banc) (quoting Church of Scientology, 113 S. Ct. at 450).\nThus, in Isidor Paiewonsky Associates v. Sharp Properties, Inc.,\n998 F.2d 145, 152 (3d Cir. 1993), we concluded that because we\ncould impose at least one of the remedies enumerated by the\nappellant, and thereby provide it \"some effective relief,\" the\nappeal was not moot. See also Swedeland, 16 F.3d at 559-60.\nThat is not the issue in this case.\n         Instead, Continental invokes the broader interpretation\nof mootness applied in bankruptcy cases, often referred to as\n\"equitable mootness.\" See, e.g., Manges v. Seattle-First Nat'l\nBank (In re Manges), 29 F.3d 1034, 1038-39 (5th Cir. 1994), cert.denied,\n115 S. Ct. 1105 (1995); In re Specialty Equip. Cos., 3\nF.3d 1043, 1048 (7th Cir. 1993); Official Comm. of Unsecured\n\fCreditors of LTV Aerospace & Defense Co. v. Official Comm. of\nUnsecured Creditors of LTV Steel Co. (In re Chateaugay Corp.),\n988 F.2d 322, 325 (2d Cir. 1993) [hereinafter Chateaugay I];\nRochman v. Northeast Utils. Serv. Group (In re Public Serv. Co.),\n963 F.2d 469, 471-72 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 908\n(1992); First Union Real Estate Equity & Mortgage Invs. v. Club\nAssocs. (In re Club Assocs.), 956 F.2d 1065, 1069 (11th Cir.\n1992); Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund\nv. Central Transp., Inc., 841 F.2d 92, 95-96 (4th Cir. 1988); In\nre AOV Indus., 792 F.2d 1140, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Trone v.\nRoberts Farms, Inc. (In re Roberts Farms, Inc.), 652 F.2d 793,\n796-97 (9th Cir. 1981). Under this widely recognized and\naccepted doctrine, the courts have held that \"[a]n appeal should\n. . . be dismissed as moot when, even though effective relief\ncould conceivably be fashioned, implementation of that relief\nwould be inequitable.\" Chateaugay I, 988 F.2d at 325.\n         The use of the word \"mootness\" as a shortcut for a\ncourt's decision that the fait accompli of a plan confirmation\nshould preclude further judicial proceedings has led to\nunfortunate confusion. In a trenchant discussion of the issue in\na recent decision of the Seventh Circuit, the court noted that\ndenominating the doctrine as \"equitable mootness\" is misleading.\nIn re UNR Indus., 20 F.3d 766, 769 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 115\nS. Ct. 509 (1994). Judge Easterbrook, writing for the court,\nstated: \"[t]here is a big difference between inability to alter\nthe outcome (real mootness) and unwillingness to alter the\noutcome ('equitable mootness'). Using one word for two different\nconcepts breeds confusion.\" Id. (emphasis in original). Thus,\nalthough the discussions and applications of the concept of\n\"mootness\" in bankruptcy cases by that court had previously\nencompassed what is referred to elsewhere as \"equitable\nmootness,\" see Specialty Equip., 3 F.3d at 1048; In re\nAndreuccetti, 975 F.2d 413, 418 (7th Cir. 1992), the court in UNR\nIndustries stated it would now \"banish 'equitable mootness' from\nthe (local) lexicon.\" 20 F.3d at 769. Instead, the court\ncontinued, \"[w]e ask not whether this case is moot, 'equitably'\nor otherwise, but whether it is prudent to upset the plan of\nreorganization at this late date.\" Id.\n         These \"equitable\" or \"prudential\" considerations focus\non \"concerns unique to bankruptcy proceedings.\" Manges, 29 F.3d\nat 1038. It is evident that \"equitable mootness\" is an inapt\ndescription of the doctrine at issue here. Nonetheless, since\npast cases have used that term, we use it in discussing them.\nTherefore, it does not further consideration of this appeal to\nargue, as the dissent does, that we have \"fallen into the trap\"\nof confusing these considerations with Article III mootness.\nWhether termed \"equitable mootness\" or a prudence doctrine, we\nsee no reason why the Third Circuit should part company with our\nsister circuits in their adoption of this doctrine. If limited\nin scope and cautiously applied, this doctrine provides a vehicle\nwhereby the court can prevent substantial harm to numerous\nparties.\n         The Trustees have not challenged the viability of the\ndoctrine of equitable mootness or application of prudential\n\fconsiderations in bankruptcy cases, nor have they cited to a case\nin any circuit that rejects the concept. Instead, they rely most\nheavily on a decision of the Second Circuit holding that even\nthough the reorganization plan for the bankrupt LTV Corporation\nhad been confirmed, the appeal of tax lessors challenging the\nplan's failure to give their claims administrative priority was\nnot moot. See Chateaugay II, 10 F.3d 944 (2d Cir. 1993).\nSignificantly, the court in Chateaugay II did not quarrel with\nthe doctrine, merely its application in that case. In fact, in\nRTC v. Best Products Co. (In re Best Products Co.), 68 F.3d 26,\n29 (2d Cir. 1995), a more recent case from the Second Circuit,\nthe court once again emphasized the language in Chateaugay I that\neven though an appeal may not be moot in the sense of Article III\nof the Constitution, it may be deemed moot in bankruptcy cases\nbecause of \"equitable considerations.\"\n         We have generally stated that we exercise plenary\nreview of a district court's decision on mootness. SeeSwedeland, 16 F.3d\nat 559; Northeast Women's Ctr., Inc. v.\nMcMonagle, 939 F.2d 57, 61 (3d Cir. 1991); International Bhd. of\nBoilermakers v. Kelly, 815 F.2d 912, 914 (3d Cir. 1987).\nHowever, none of those cases involved a determination, like the\none we review here, that an appeal following a consummated\nbankruptcy reorganization should be dismissed for equitable and\nprudential reasons even though some effective relief is\navailable. Surprisingly, we have seen little more than a few\ncursory references to the standard of review in the cases from\nother circuits applying this doctrine. See AOV Indus., 792 F.2d\nat 1148 (district court's power to dismiss appeal as moot\n\"discretionary\"); Club Assocs., 956 F.2d at 1069 (legal\ndeterminations reviewed de novo, bankruptcy court's factual\nfindings reviewed for clear error).\n         Because the mootness determination we review here\ninvolves a discretionary balancing of equitable and prudential\nfactors rather than the limits of the federal courts' authority\nunder Article III, using ordinary review principles we review\nthat decision generally for abuse of discretion. Cf. General\nGlass Indus. Corp. v. Monsour Medical Found., 973 F.2d 197, 200\n(3d Cir. 1992) (abstention determination reviewed under abuse of\ndiscretion standard); Bermuda Express, N.V. v. M/V Litsa, 872\nF.2d 554, 557 (3d Cir.) (balancing of equities involved in\napplication of laches doctrine reviewed for abuse of discretion),\ncert. denied, 493 U.S. 819 (1989); Bennett v. White, 865 F.2d\n1395, 1402 (3d Cir.) (scope of a remedial order reviewed for\nabuse of discretion), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 920 (1989); Evans v.\nBuchanan, 555 F.2d 373, 378-79 (3d Cir.) (in banc) (same), cert.denied,\n434 U.S. 880 (1977). A particular case may also raise\nlegal and/or factual issues interspersed with the prudential\nones, and then the applicable review standard, plenary or clearly\nerroneous, will apply.\n         The dissent argues that the cases cited above are\ninapposite because the district court acted as an appellate court\nand that we should therefore use plenary review. However, the\nproposition that when an appellate court reviews a lower court's\nbalancing of prudential factors, it does so under an abuse of\n\fdiscretion standard as long as the factors considered are not\ninappropriate as a matter of law is a general one applicable in\nall fields, not excluding bankruptcy. As the Fifth Circuit noted\nin a bankruptcy case:\n         In this particular case, we are reviewing the decision\n         of the district court in its capacity as an appellate\n         court. Several different standards of review govern\n         our decision, depending on the nature of the holdings\n         reviewed. Where the disputed holding involves a matter\n         that is within the district court's discretion, we will\n         affirm the judgment of a district court acting in its\n         appellate role unless the court has clearly abused its\n         discretion.\n\nMatter of HECI Exploration Co., Inc., 862 F.2d 513, 519\n(citations omitted).\n                                B.\n         Factors that have been considered by courts in\ndetermining whether it would be equitable or prudential to reach\nthe merits of a bankruptcy appeal include (1) whether the\nreorganization plan has been substantially consummated, (2)\nwhether a stay has been obtained, (3) whether the relief\nrequested would affect the rights of parties not before the\ncourt, (4) whether the relief requested would affect the success\nof the plan, and (5) the public policy of affording finality to\nbankruptcy judgments. See Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039; Rochman, 963\nF.2d at 471-72. The Trustees have not taken issue with our\nidentification of these factors.\n         Although these five factors have been given varying\nweight, depending on the particular circumstances, the foremost\nconsideration has been whether the reorganization plan has been\nsubstantially consummated. This is especially so where the\nreorganization involves intricate transactions, see Rochman, 963\nF.2d at 473-74 (performance under plan involved \"numerous complex\narrangements\"); Roberts Farms, 652 F.2d at 797 (plan involved\n\"many intricate and involved transactions\" and reversal of plan's\nconfirmation \"would knock the props out from under\" such\ntransactions and \"create an unmanageable, uncontrollable\nsituation for the Bankruptcy Court\"), or where outside investors\nhave relied on the confirmation of the plan, see Manges, 29 F.3d\nat 1039 (equitable mootness \"protects the interests of non-\nadverse third parties who are not before the reviewing court but\nwho have acted in reliance upon the plan as implemented\"); UNR\nIndus., 20 F.3d at 770 (\"[b]y protecting the interests of persons\nwho acquire assets in reliance on a plan of reorganization, a\ncourt increases the price the estate can realize ex ante, and\nthus produces benefits for creditors in the aggregate\"); Rochman,\n963 F.2d at 474 (reorganization involved $1.5 billion in\nfinancing from 100,000 sources); Club Assocs., 956 F.2d at 1070\n(\"a number of investors, who were not parties to this case, had\ncommitted new funds to the 'reemerged Club' with the expectation\nof receiving a preferred return on their investments\").\n         \"Substantial consummation\" is defined in the Bankruptcy\nCode as: \"(A) transfer of all or substantially all of the\n\fproperty proposed by the plan to be transferred; (B) assumption\nby the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of\nthe business or of the management of all or substantially all of\nthe property dealt with by the plan; and (C) commencement of\ndistribution under the plan.\" 11 U.S.C.    1101(2). In such\ninstances, the strong public interest in the finality of\nbankruptcy reorganizations is particularly compelling.\n\n         The district court dismissed the Trustees' appeals to\nit as \"moot\" based on the conclusions, set forth in its opinion\ndated December 30, 1993, that substantial consummation of the\nPlan had occurred, the Investors had already made their $450\nmillion investment into the reorganized entity, all elements of\nthe Plan, except distributions to the unsecured creditors, had\nbeen completed, and a reversal of the order confirming the Plan\nlikely would put Continental back into bankruptcy. App. at 1873.\nThe court also noted that Continental had implemented the Plan\nfollowing its approval by the court because the Trustees had\nfailed to obtain a stay.\n         The Trustees do not challenge that there had been\nsubstantial consummation by December 1993, when the district\ncourt dismissed the appeals as moot. They suggest that as their\nobject is not to disturb the reorganization, but only to get\npayment from the reorganized Continental for their adequate\nprotection claim measured by the market value decline of the\ncollateral during bankruptcy, the line of cases upon which\nContinental relies is inapplicable. We cannot agree, because the\nrejection of the Trustees' claim by the bankruptcy court was\ninextricably intertwined with the implementation of the\nreorganization. See AOV Indus., 792 F.2d at 1148 (to evaluate\nmootness, court must \"scrutinize each individual claim, testing\nthe feasibility of granting the relief against its potential\nimpact on the reorganization scheme as a whole\"). Thus, the\nTrustees cannot avoid the effect of the substantial consummation\nof the reorganization plan so readily.\n         Inasmuch as Continental agrees that the issue is not\nconstitutional mootness but prudential mootness, we will assume\narguendo that even after substantial or total consummation of its\nreorganization, some effective relief would have been available\nfor the Trustees' claim at the time they appealed to the district\ncourt, and on appeal to this court. Even before the in banc\ncourt, Continental has not challenged that assumption. It is\nquite another matter in light of the substantial, indeed\nirrevocable, change in the status quo that followed confirmation\nto determine that it would have been prudent for the court to\nreach the merits of the Trustees' claim. For the district court\nhad before it an unstayed bankruptcy reorganization plan, and\nmany courts have based their prudential decisions to decline to\nconsider challenges to bankruptcy court orders on the ground that\nthere has been substantial consummation of a plan of\nreorganization in reliance upon an unstayed confirmation order.\nSee, e.g., Rochman, 963 F.2d at 475.\n         In Chateaugay I, the court noted that although the\nBankruptcy Code only requires a stay pending appeal in limited\n\fcircumstances, there is a procedure under Bankruptcy Rule 8005 to\nseek to preserve the status quo and \"[t]he party who appeals\nwithout seeking to avail himself of that protection does so at\nhis own risk.\" 988 F.2d at 326. And in In re Manges, the court\nobserved, under the descriptive title \"Halting the Runaway Train:\nthe Motions to Stay,\" that \"in many of the cases in which\nbankruptcy appeals were dismissed as moot, the appellants failed\nto seek a stay.\" 29 F.3d at 1039.\n         Even the seeking of a stay may not be enough. The\nappellants in In re UNR Industries had sought a stay, albeit\nunsuccessfully, at every opportunity; nonetheless, the court\nnoted, \"[a] stay not sought, and a stay sought and denied, lead\nequally to the implementation of the plan of reorganization.\" 20\nF.3d at 770; accord AOV Indus., 792 F.2d at 1144, 1146-47.\n         Shortly after the confirmation of the Continental Plan,\nthe Trustees filed an Emergency Motion for Conditional Stay of\nOrder Confirming the Plan pending their appeal to the district\ncourt. The condition the Trustees sought in lieu of a stay was\nthe establishment of a segregated account for $117 million, the\nfull amount of their adequate protection claim, or alternatively\nat least $22 million, which they claim was the admitted decline\nin the value of the collateral. See App. at 1721. In response\nto the district court's inquiry, they conceded that they were not\nwilling to post any bond. The district court never required a\nsupersedeas bond in the amount of $450,000,000, as the Trustees\nhave suggested. In fact, the district court tried to ascertain\nthe amount of bond that would be reasonable, and the Trustees'\ngeneral position was that they were \"merely the fiduciary of the\nmoney of their bondholders\" and they suggested no lesser amount.\nApp. at 1729.\n         Thus, as one of the reasons for its order denying the\nstay, the district court noted the unwillingness of the Trustees\nto post a bond satisfactory to the court. App. at 1756. See,\ne.g., Central States, 841 F.2d at 95 (appellant's failure to post\nbond to stay confirmation order basis for finding appeal moot).\nBecause the failure to post the bond needed to get a stay\npermitted the consummation of the plan, this factor weighs\nheavily in favor of the district court's declination to delve\ninto the merits of the Trustees' appeal.\n         The Trustees argue that this court has held that\nfailure to obtain a stay does not necessarily render an appeal\nmoot. The cases to which they refer are not apposite. In one,\nIn re Joshua Slocum Ltd., 922 F.2d 1081 (3d Cir. 1990), the issue\nwas the narrow one of the power of the bankruptcy court to excise\na paragraph from a shopping center lease. There is no indication\nin Slocum that there had been any confirmation of a plan before\nor during the appeal.\n         In the more recent case to which the Trustees refer,\nMegafoods Stores, Inc. v. Flagstaff Realty Assocs. (In re\nFlagstaff Realty Assocs.), 60 F.3d 1031 (3d Cir. 1995), the\nappeal also presented a narrow landlord-tenant issue, i.e. the\neffect of confirmation of the landlord's plan on a tenant's right\nto pursue its appeal of the bankruptcy court's denial of its\nrecoupment claim. In holding that it was not necessary for the\n\ftenant to seek a stay in order to pursue its right to appeal\ndespite the confirmation in the interim, we noted the line of\ncases placing recoupment and setoff in a special category and\nstated, \"although we recognize the importance of maintaining the\nintegrity of confirmed plans from later attack, these unique\ncircumstances permit the plan to be reopened and readjusted.\"\nId. at 1036. Thus, neither Flagstaff nor Slocum addressed the\nequitable or prudential mootness considerations at issue here.\n          High on the list of prudential considerations taken\ninto account by courts considering whether to allow an appeal\nfollowing a consummated reorganization is the reliance by third\nparties, in particular investors, on the finality of the\ntransaction. See Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039 (\"[t]he concept of\n'mootness' from a prudential standpoint protects the interests of\nnon-adverse third parties who are not before the reviewing court\nbut who have acted in reliance upon the plan as implemented\");\nRochman, 963 F.3d at 474-75 (similar). Here, the record is\nreplete with evidence that the Investors relied on the bankruptcy\ncourt's unstayed Confirmation Order in making the decision to\nproceed to close the transaction and that an essential factor in\nthat decision was the bankruptcy court's disallowance of the\nTrustees' adequate protection claim.\n         The Plan of reorganization provided that the\nreorganized Continental would pay \"Allowed Administrative\nClaims.\" App. at 656, 691 (Plan     5.5, 10.1). Among the\nadministrative claims that were still disputed at the time of the\nconfirmation hearing were several large claims, including, in\nparticular, labor claims by airline pilots, large claims by\nEastern Airlines, and the Trustees' claim for adequate protection\nbased on alleged market decline of the collateral. App. at 1223,\n1346. One of the concerns of the Investors that needed to be\nsatisfied as a condition of their participation was that the\ntotal amount that would have to be paid for allowed\nadministrative claims could be distorted by a few such large\nclaims. To limit their exposure, the Investment Agreement\nprovided that the Investors' obligation to proceed with the\narrangements was subject, inter alia, to the payments and\nobligations for administrative claims being no higher than a\nspecified amount, or \"cap.\" App. at 408.\n         At the confirmation hearing, Continental's expert\nwitness testified that if the claims of the Airline Pilots and\nthe Trustees were excluded, the total allowed administrative\nclaims payable under the Plan would be close to the cap, and that\nif the Trustees' claim were allowed, the cap would be exceeded,\nallowing the Investors to walk away from the deal. App. at 1223-\n24, 1333-38. Based on this testimony, Continental argued to the\nbankruptcy court that the feasibility determination required for\nconfirmation under 11 U.S.C.   1129(a)(11) would turn in part on\nthe adjudication of the Trustees' still outstanding\nadministrative claim. App. at 1400. Continental therefore urged\nthe court to incorporate its adjudication of the Trustees' claim\ninto the Confirmation Order itself, asserting that the Investors\nwould not go forward with the deal \"unless there is an order upon\nwhich they can place reliance, which is going to be a plan\n\fconfirmation order.\" App. at 1400. The Trustees argued against\nincorporation, taking the position that even though the amount of\nthe adequate protection claim allowed by the court would be\nrelevant to the court's subsequent determination of feasibility,\nthe adjudication of the claim itself was a separate matter from\nplan confirmation. App. at 1401.\n         The bankruptcy court ultimately took the approach urged\nby Continental, incorporating into its Confirmation Order its\ndecision denying the Trustees' adequate protection claim. As\npart of its feasibility determination, it explicitly found that\nneither the pilots' claims nor the Eastern claims was entitled to\nadministrative priority, and that the Trustees' adequate\nprotection claim had no value as an administrative claim. App.\nat 1549-51. On that basis, it found that there was substantial,\ncredible and uncontested evidence that the administrative claims\npayable at confirmation -- excluding the claims of the pilots,\nEastern, and the Trustees -- would be within the specified limit\nof the cap set forth in the Investment Agreement, App. at 1548,\nnoting that the adjudications of the Trustees' claim and the\nEastern claims were \"crucial to the willingness of the Investors\nto consummate the Financing Transaction.\" App. at 1550.\n         We are unwilling to accept the Trustees' suggestion,\nimplicit in their briefs and made explicit at oral argument, that\nthe bankruptcy court's ruling on the merits of their adequate\nprotection claim was colored by a so-called \"ultimatum\" from\nContinental that if the claim were granted the Investors would\nabandon the reorganization. See In Banc Argument Transcript at 3.\nThe Trustees offer no evidence in support of this suggestion, and\nwe certainly would not lightly impute such a motive to the\nbankruptcy court. In effect, the Trustees are challenging the\nInvestors' right to condition their investment on the amount of\napproved administrative claims. This was never raised below at\nthe time of the Investment Agreement, the ultimate confirmation\nor the period between. We know of no statute, rule or precedent\nthat would deny investors the right to limit their investments on\nthe existence of conditions which they believe give the newly\nreorganized company a reasonable opportunity to succeed -- such\nas, in this case, without being weighed down by excessive\nadministrative expenses.\n         The Trustees also argue that Continental's position at\nthe confirmation hearing, that the adjudication of the Trustees'\nclaim should be incorporated into the Confirmation Order, was a\n\"ploy\" to \"disingenuously\" use the fact of such incorporation to\n\"manufactur[e] the appearance of mootness.\" Appellants' Brief at\n3; In Banc Argument Transcript at 1. Their characterization of\nContinental's position as a \"ploy\" implies that it had no\nlegitimate reason. In light of the integral nexus between the\nfeasibility of confirmation and the adjudication of the Trustees'\nclaim, it appears that the suggestion of incorporation urged by\nContinental and adopted by the bankruptcy court was reasonable\nand reflected the inescapable fact that the Trustees' claim and\nthe confirmation of the Plan were inextricably intertwined,\nrather than an attempt to \"manufacture\" the appearance of\nequitable mootness.\n\f         In dismissing the Trustees' appeals as moot, the\ndistrict court specifically found that the Investors had relied\non the bankruptcy court's unstayed Confirmation Order and that\nthere was an integral nexus between the investment and the\nsuccess of the Plan. The court stated, \"[t]he Investors relied\non the unstayed Confirmation Order in making the $450 million\ninvestment in Continental's Plan. It is clear that [the\nTrustees'] requested relief would undermine the grounds which the\nInvestors relied upon in making their investment and would\nrequire a dismantling of the entire Plan.\" App. at 1874.\nAlthough the Trustees argue that this finding is erroneous, there\nis support for it in the record.\n         At the hearing in April 1993 before the district court\non the Trustees' request for the conditional stay of the\nConfirmation Order, counsel for the Trustees stated they had\ntestimony that \"as a matter of business judgment, it would be\nextremely unlikely for the investors to walk away from this deal\nif . . . a 22-million-dollar deposit was established.\" App. at\n1727. The Trustees' counsel in effect challenged the Investors\nto assert otherwise, stating that inasmuch as the Investors'\ncounsel were in court they could correct any assertions that he\nmade. Id.    Thereafter, the Investors' attorney rose \"to make\nclear the [I]nvestors' position, which is that if the relief is\ngranted to [the Trustees] which they seek from the Court this\nmorning [the stay conditioned on a deposit of some $22 million to\n$117 million], then we are not prepared to close the\ntransaction.\" App. at 1744.\n         The representative of the Investors explained that in\nthe airline business \"there is a great sensitivity to cash and\nthe capital structure of a reorganized entity,\" and that the\nrelief that the Trustees sought \"could significantly impair the\ncapital structure that would exist with respect [to] this\nreorganized airline.\" Id. at 1744-45. He reviewed the\nnegotiations that had occurred for the cap for administrative\nexpense liability, advised that the Investors had monitored on a\nmonthly basis Continental's performance in that respect, and\nexplained that the Investors had insisted that the Confirmation\nOrder address the issue of the Trustees' claim \"because we want\nto make sure if we are putting our money in, we are getting the\nbenefit of our bargain, which is a reorganized entity with a\ncapital structure that we contemplated.\" App. at 1746. He\nconcluded by stating unequivocally that if a stay were entered\nconditioned upon the bond the Trustees sought, then his client\n\"would not be prepared to close this transaction.\" Id. The\nTrustees' counsel did not thereafter argue that the Investors'\ncounsel's statements were insufficiently probative, and therefore\nthat suggestion here is less than persuasive.\n         The Trustees have not contested here that if their\nclaim for market value decline of the collateral (a claim\nindependent of their claim for the use and maintenance of the\ncollateral, which has been satisfied) had been approved as an\nadministrative claim, the total such administrative claim would\nhave greatly exceeded the cap specified by the Investors for that\npurpose. This would have given the Investors the option to\n\fwithdraw; such withdrawal would have placed the entire Plan in\njeopardy. By the time the district court ruled on the appeal, it\nwas no longer possible to restore the parties to their earlier\npositions because the investment had been made, and the option to\nwithdraw was no longer available to the Investors. See Specialty\nEquip., 3 F.3d at 1049 (claim held moot when its acceptance\n\"would amount to imposing a different plan of reorganization on\nthe parties\"). Thus, the third factor bearing on the prudential\ndetermination whether to reach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal\nafter confirmation and in the absence of a stay -- the effect of\nthe requested relief on the rights of parties not before the\ncourt -- weighs heavily against the Trustees.\n         This factor cannot fairly be recast as whether the\nInvestors or others reasonably relied on the prediction that the\nTrustees would recover nothing on their claim. While we agree\nthat reliance of the Investors and others on the unstayed\nConfirmation Order is of central importance to our analysis, to\nfocus on the \"reasonableness\" of that reliance, at least as\nmeasured by the likelihood of reversal on appeal, is necessarily\na circular enterprise and therefore of little utility. Whether\nthe Investors were reasonable in relying on the bankruptcy\ncourt's order depends on whether this was a case that would be\nconsidered on the merits on appeal or would be dismissed on the\nbasis of the doctrine often referred to as \"equitable mootness.\"\nAnd whether this case would be dismissed on \"equitable mootness\"\ngrounds on appeal in turn depends on whether the Investors\nreasonably relied. Thus, placing the focus on the reasonableness\nof the Investors' reliance as measured by the probability that\nContinental would prevail on appeal sets up a straw man which is\neasily knocked down.\n         Our inquiry should not be about the \"reasonableness\" of\nthe Investors' reliance or the probability of either party\nsucceeding on appeal. Rather, we should ask whether we want to\nencourage or discourage reliance by investors and others on the\nfinality of bankruptcy confirmation orders. The strong public\npolicy in favor of maximizing debtors' estates and facilitating\nsuccessful reorganization, reflected in the Code itself, clearly\nweighs in favor of encouraging such reliance. Indeed, the\nimportance of allowing approved reorganizations to go forward in\nreliance on bankruptcy court confirmation orders may be the\ncentral animating force behind the equitable mootness doctrine.\nSee Rochman, 963 F.2d at 471-72; Metro Property Mgmt. Co. v.\nInformation Dialogues, Inc. (In re Information Dialogues, Inc.),\n662 F.2d 475, 477 (8th Cir. 1981). Where, as here, investors and\nother third parties consummated a massive reorganization in\nreliance on an unstayed confirmation order that, explicitly and\nas a condition of feasibility, denied the claim for which\nappellate review is sought, the allowance of such appellate\nreview would likely undermine public confidence in the finality\nof bankruptcy confirmation orders and make successful completion\nof large reorganizations like this more difficult. This is true\nregardless of whether the Investors' reliance was \"reasonable\" or\nbased on a 30%, 60%, or 100% probability of success on appeal, an\nissue raised at the oral argument.\n\f         In arguing against dismissal here on the basis of\nprudential considerations, the Trustees repeatedly rely on their\nassertion that the Plan contained \"a built-in mechanism for the\n[post-confirmation] disposition and payment of Disputed\nAdministrative Claims.\" Appellants' Brief at 10. On the basis\nof this provision, they argue that they had no obligation to take\nsteps to preserve the status quo through a stay, that their\nappeal is not moot because \"some effective relief\" is available,\nand that the Plan is contractually \"binding\" on Continental.\nThey conclude that the district court therefore erred in\n\"permitt[ing] Continental to escape its 'contractual' obligations\nunder the Plan under the guise of the mootness doctrine.\"\nAppellant's Brief at 20. While the Trustees' description of the\n\"mechanism\" provided in the Plan is technically correct, they\noverstate the impact of that mechanism.\n         Under the definitions in the Plan, the Trustees' claim\nwas a \"Disputed Administrative Claim\" because it sought adequate\nprotection payments, see App. at 623-24 (Plan    1.4(vi)) and was\nthe subject of a timely objection, see App. at 632 (Plan\n1.85(a)). The Plan requires the reorganized Continental to pay\nallowed administrative claims on the later of: the effective\ndate of confirmation or \"the fifth Business Day after such Claim\nis Allowed.\" App. at 691 (Plan    10.1). Further, the Plan\nprovides that \"[a] Disputed Claim shall be an Allowed Claim if,\nand only to the extent that, such Disputed Claim has been Allowed\nby a Final Order,\" App. at 623 (Plan    1.5), and defines a \"Final\nOrder\" as \"[a]n order which is no longer subject to appeal,\ncertiorari proceeding or other proceeding for review or\nrehearing, and as to which no [such proceeding is] pending,\" App.\nat 635 (Plan   1.100).\n         Thus, the Plan imposes an obligation on the reorganized\nContinental to pay disputed administrative claims once they\nbecome allowed by a final order of court, even if such final\norder does not occur until after confirmation. If the bankruptcy\ncourt's disallowance of the Trustees' claim were to be reversed\non appeal, the Plan appears to provide a \"mechanism\" for payment\nof the claim by the reorganized Continental. The mere\navailability of such a mechanism, however, which may prevent\ndismissal on the ground of Article III constitutional mootness,\ndoes not warrant reversal of the district court's order\ndismissing it on prudential grounds. As we have noted, the\ndistrict court's \"mootness\" determination was based not on a\nfinding that no effective relief was available, but rather on the\nfinding that in light of all the circumstances, it would be\ninequitable to grant relief. Nor has any \"contractual\nobligation\" been violated either by Continental or the district\ncourt. Where, as here, there has been no order, final or\notherwise, allowing the Trustees' disputed administrative claim,\nthe Plan imposes no obligation on the reorganized Continental to\npay it.\n         Finally, the Plan provisions allowing for post-\nconfirmation payment of allowed claims in no way obviated the\nTrustees' obligation to seek a stay. Here, where the\nconfirmation of the Plan and the willingness of the Investors to\n\fgo forward turned on the bankruptcy court's denial of the\nTrustees' claims, and where the denial of those claims was in\nfact incorporated into the Confirmation Order, there was a clear\npossibility that the Trustees' claims would become moot after\nconsummation of the Plan, and it was therefore incumbent on the\nTrustees to obtain a stay. Indeed, the record shows that all\nparties were well aware of the extensive legal precedent\ndismissing as moot or on equitable grounds appeals from unstayed\nconsummated reorganizations. See App. at 410 (references in the\nInvestment Agreement); App. at 1729-30, 1741 (argument before the\ndistrict court on the stay).\n         For similar reasons, we fail to see the inconsistency\ncharged by the Trustees between Continental's current position\nas to \"equitable mootness\" and its argument to the bankruptcy\ncourt in response to the Trustees' Deposit Motion that the Plan\nwould require payment of the Trustees' claim by the reorganized\nContinental if and when allowed. See App. at 1039. As noted\nabove, the Plan imposes no obligation on Continental in the\nabsence of a final order allowing the Trustees' claim, and the\nmere availability of a mechanism for granting relief does not\nmean the court cannot determine that in light of all the\ncircumstances it should not even try to unscramble the eggs.\n         Moreover, at the time Continental argued against the\nDeposit Motion the bankruptcy court had not yet ruled disallowing\nthe Trustees' claim nor cited that as an explicit basis for its\nfeasibility determination in confirming the plan. Accordingly,\nContinental did not yet have reason to know that the claim would\nbe denied and become subject to \"equitable mootness\" on appeal.\nAs soon as the basis for this mootness argument became apparent,\nContinental repeatedly asserted its intention to make such an\nargument if an appeal was filed and no stay obtained. App. at\n1691, 1742.\n         The Trustees have not presented us with any arguments\nwhich would weigh against all of the prudential considerations\nthat dictate that this consummated reorganization must be left in\nplace. Following confirmation, Continental was operating as a\nrestructured company, and had entered into countless new\nrelationships and transactions. To convince a court to take the\naction sought by the Trustees which would undermine the basis for\nthe Investors' decision to proceed, the Trustees would have to\nproffer a powerful reason indeed. They have not even attempted\nto do so.\n         Arrayed against that silence are the facts that the\nreorganization plan was consummated, no stay was obtained,\nnumerous other parties have changed their positions, and numerous\nirrevocable transactions have since been completed as a result of\nthe consummation of the Plan. Without listing all of such\ntransactions set forth by Continental in its brief, we note that\namong those are the distribution to unsecured creditors, the\nmerger of 53 debtors other than Continental with and into\nContinental, the investment of $110 million in cash by Air\nPartners and Air Canada in the reorganized Continental, the\ntransfer by foreign governments of various route authorities, and\nthe assumption by the reorganized Continental of unexpired leases\n\fand executory contracts worth over $5.0 billion. Thus, the key\nissue really is whether the district court abused its discretion\nin weighing the various equitable factors. We are not prepared\nto hold that the balance reached by the district court was an\nabuse of its discretion.\n         Under the circumstances presented here, we can see no\nprudential considerations that would support an attempt by an\nappellate court, district or court of appeals, to fashion even a\nlimited remedy for the Trustees. That would necessarily entail\nimposing a new debt on the reorganized company, which is a\ndifferent entity than it was when this case was before the\ndistrict court. Thus, we agree with the determination of the\ndistrict court to dismiss the Trustees' claim. We base our\nholding on our conclusion that it would be neither prudent nor\nequitable to grant the Trustees the relief they seek.\n                               III.\n                            CONCLUSION\n         For the reasons set forth we will affirm the order of\nthe district court.\n\nIn Re: Continental Airlines\nNo. 94-7748\n\n\n\n\nALITO, Circuit Judge, dissenting, joined by Judges Becker,\nGreenberg, Lewis, McKee and Sarokin.\n\n\n         The majority's decision in this case creates a bad\nprecedent for our circuit. The majority adopts the curious\ndoctrine of \"equitable mootness,\" which it interprets as\npermitting federal district courts and courts of appeals to\nrefuse to entertain the merits of live bankruptcy appeals over\nwhich they indisputably possess statutory jurisdiction and in\nwhich they can plainly provide relief. According to the\nmajority, there is no clear rule for determining when a\nbankruptcy appeal is \"equitably moot.\" Instead, this is said to\nbe a discretionary determination to be made in the first instance\nby the district court based on a weighing of five factors that\nthe majority has culled from the opinions of our \"sister\ncircuits.\" In my view, if the doctrine of \"equitable mootness\"\nhas any validity, it is more limited than the majority holds.\n          The dangers inherent in the majority's adoption and\nbroad interpretation of this doctrine are illustrated by this\ncase. In simple terms, this is what happened. After filing for\nrelief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, Continental\nAirlines continued to use certain aircraft and jet engines that\nwere held as collateral entrusted to the Trustees. Believing\nthat their collateral was undergoing a dramatic diminution in\nvalue, the Trustees in August 1992 filed a renewed motion in the\nbankruptcy court seeking \"adequate protection\" under 11 U.S.C.\n363(e). During the next eight months, while the Continental\n\freorganization plan proceeded toward confirmation, the bankruptcy\ncourt did not rule on this motion. In March 1993, Continental\ninsisted that the bankruptcy court rule on the Trustees' motion\nat the same time that it confirmed the plan, and Continental told\nthe bankruptcy judge that unless the motion was denied, the\nprospective investors in the reorganized corporation would\nwithhold funding, and the reorganization would not go forward.\nSee Continental Br. at 5-6 & n.1. Furthermore, Continental took\nthe position that if the plan was confirmed and went into effect,\nany appeal would be moot. See Continental Br. at 21. The\nbankruptcy court then simultaneously denied the Trustees' motion\nand entered the order confirming the plan. The Trustees\nexercised their statutory right to appeal to the district court,\nand in my view the need for review by an Article III court is\nparticularly acute when the challenged ruling of the bankruptcy\ncourt is made under circumstances such as these.\n         The Trustees, however, have been utterly denied such\nreview. In the initial level of appeal, the district court\nopined that the Trustees probably would have won if the merits of\ntheir appeal had been reached (JA 1755-56), but the district\ncourt dismissed their appeal as moot. Likewise, the majority of\nour court describes the Trustees' arguments as \"interesting and\nchallenging\" (Maj. Op. at 9) but then throws them out of court\nwithout reaching the merits of their arguments. And the majority\ndoes this even though (a) this case is clearly not \"moot\" in any\nproper sense of the term, (b) we unquestionably have statutory\njurisdiction, and (c) we have a \"virtually unflagging obligation\"\nto exercise the jurisdiction that we have been given. Colorado\nRiver Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800,\n817 (1976). I am puzzled and troubled by what the majority has\ndone.\n\n                                   I.\n\n         As the majority notes, the Trustees have not contested\nthe existence of the doctrine of \"equitable mootness,\" and in\nlight of the Trustees' position, I think that it is appropriate\nto assume the existence of this doctrine for purposes of this\nappeal. The majority opinion, however, does not simply assume\nthe existence of this doctrine but adopts it as part of the law\nof our circuit. In doing so, the majority does not undertake an\nindependent analysis of the origin or scope of the doctrine but\nis instead content to rely on the decisions of other courts of\nappeals. From these decisions, the majority extracts five\nfactors, which are to be weighed by the district court in the\ninitial level of appeal for the purpose of determining whether\nthe appeal is \"equitably moot.\" Maj. Op. at 14. These factors\nare: \"(1) whether the reorganization plan has been substantially\nconsummated, (2) whether a stay has been obtained, (3) whether\nthe relief requested would affect the rights of parties not\nbefore the court, (4) whether the relief requested would affect\nthe success of the plan, and (5) the public policy of affording\nfinality to bankruptcy judgments.\" Maj. Op. at 15.\n         I am not convinced that the majority's test is\n\fconsistent with the law of all of the circuits that the majority\nclaims to be following. For example, the Eleventh Circuit holds\nthat the proper test is \"whether the `reorganization plan has\nbeen so substantially consummated that effective relief is no\nlonger available.'\" In re Club Associates, 956 F.2d 1065, 1069\n(11th Cir. 1992) (quoting Miami Center Ltd. Partnership v. Bank\nof New York, 820 F.2d 376, 379 (11th Cir. 1987)). This inquiry\nseems quite different from the majority's indeterminate five-\nfactor test. But even if the majority's analysis is supported by\nthe decisions it cites, and even though I think that those\ndecisions deserve careful and respectful consideration, I think\nthat the in banc majority should have made an independent\nexamination of the basis and scope of the doctrine of \"equitable\nmootness\" before engraving it in our circuit's law.\n         What is the basis of this doctrine? As the majority\nacknowledges, it does not stem from the \"case-or-controversy\"\nrequirement of Article III. See Maj. Op. at 10. For example, it\nis not argued that the case now before us is moot in the Article\nIII sense.\n         Nor does it appear that this doctrine is rooted in non-\nArticle III mootness decisions \"reflect[ing] avowedly flexible\ndoctrines of remedy and judicial administration.\" 13A Charles\nAlan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, and Edward H. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure   3533.1 at 222 (1984). These doctrines\nare said to focus on the question whether \"granting a present\ndetermination of the issues offered, and perhaps the entry of\nmore specific orders, will have some effect in the real world.\"\nId. at   3533.1 at 226 (footnote omitted). Here, it is clear\nthat a determination of the merits of the issues raised by the\nTrustees and the entry of a remedial order on the basis of such a\ndetermination would have \"some effect\" -- and potentially quite a\nsubstantial effect -- in the real world. (That is precisely why\nContinental does not want us to entertain the appeal!)\n\n         Thus, as this case well illustrates, the doctrine of\n\"equitable mootness\" is not really about \"mootness\" at all in\neither the Article III or non-Article III sense. As the Seventh\nCircuit stated in a passage that the majority quotes with\napproval (see Maj. Op. at 12), \"[t]here is a big difference\nbetween inability to alter the outcome (real mootness) and\nunwillingness to alter the outcome (`equitable mootness'). Using\none word for two different concepts breeds confusion.\" In re UNR\nIndus., Inc., 20 F.3d 766, 769 (7th Cir.) (emphasis in original),\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 509 (1994).\n         If the doctrine of \"equitable mootness\" is not based on\nreal mootness principles, on what is it based? The cases cited\nby the majority and the parties suggest two possible answers.\n         The first is provided by the earliest court of appeals\ndecision cited by the majority, In re Roberts Farms, Inc., 652\nF.2d 793, 796-97 (9th Cir. 1981), and several others. See In re\nAOV Industries, Inc., 792 F.2d 1140, 1147 (D.C. Cir. 1986); In re\nInformation Dialogues, Inc., 662 F.2d 475, 477 (8th Cir. 1981).\nThe modest authority on which the Roberts Farms court relied was\na provision of former Bankruptcy Rule 805, which concerned stays\n\fpending appeal. Added by a 1976 amendment to the rule, the\nprovision in question stated:\n         Unless an order approving a sale of property\n         or issuance of a certificate of indebtedness\n         is stayed pending appeal, the sale to a good\n         faith purchaser or the issuance of a\n         certificate to a good faith holder shall not\n         be affected by the reversal or modification\n         of such order on appeal, whether or not the\n         purchaser or holder knows of the pendency of\n         the appeal.\n\n         Although I do not find the Roberts Farms opinion\nentirely clear, I think that the best reading of the opinion is\nthat the challenge to the plan of reorganization in that case\ncould not be entertained because no relief was practicable as a\nresult of the many post-confirmation transactions that were\nirreversible due to this provision of former Rule 805. See 652\nF.2d at 797. In any event, whether or not this is what the\nRoberts Farms court meant to say, I do not see how any broader\nrule could reasonably be extracted from the provision of former\nBankruptcy Rule 805 on which the Roberts Farms court relied or\nfrom the analogous provisions now contained in 11 U.S.C.\n363(m) and 364(e). If one begins with narrow provisions such as\nthese -- which merely prevent the upsetting of certain specific\ntransactions if stays are not obtained -- I do not see how one\ncan derive the broad doctrine of \"equitable mootness\" that the\nmajority in this case appears to embrace.\n         What apparently happened, however, was that the holding\nof Roberts Farms was gradually extended well beyond anything that\ncould be supported by the authority on which Roberts Farmsrested.\nSubsequent cases first cited Roberts Farms in support of\nthe proposition that a bankruptcy appeal cannot be entertained if\nthe court could not grant \"effective relief.\" See, e.g., In re\nInformation Dialogues, Inc., 662 F.2d at 477. Later, Roberts\nFarms was interpreted more expansively to mean that an appeal\ncould not be entertained if a court could not award relief that\nwas \"equitable.\" See In re Chateaugay Corp., 988 F.2d 322, 324\n(2d Cir. 1993) (citing Roberts Farms). And this latter holding\nfigures prominently in the majority's analysis. See Maj. Op. at\n12. In my view, this gradual but ultimately quite substantial\nextension of Roberts Farms cannot be squared with the narrow\nauthority on which that decision relied. Accordingly, if\nanything like the majority's decision in this case is to be\ndefended, some other foundation for the doctrine of \"equitable\nmootness\" must be found.\n         The second possible basis for the doctrine of\n\"equitable mootness\" is suggested in In re UNR Indus., supra,\nwhere the Seventh Circuit wrote:\n              Several provisions of the Bankruptcy\n         Code of 1978 provide that courts should keep\n         their hands off consummated transactions.\n         For example, 11 U.S.C.   363(m) says that the\n         reversal of an order authorizing the sale or\n\f         lease of property of an estate \"does not\n         affect the validity of a sale or lease under\n         such authorization to an entity that\n         purchased or leased such property in good\n         faith, whether or not such entity knew of the\n         pendency of the appeal.\" Unless the sale is\n         stayed pending appeal, the transaction\n         survives even if it should not have been\n         authorized in the first place. See In re\n         Sax, 796 F.2d 994 (7th Cir. 1986); cf. In re\n         Edwards, 962 F.2d 641 (7th Cir. 1992)\n         (concluding that   363(m) does not, however,\n         forbid all forms of collateral attack).\n         Another section of the Code, 11 U.S.C.\n         1127(b), dramatically curtails the power of a\n         bankruptcy court to modify a plan of\n         reorganization after its confirmation and\n         \"substantial consummation.\" Section 1127(b),\n         unlike   363(m), does not place any limit on\n         the power of the court of appeals, but the\n         reasons underlying    363(m) and 1127(b) --\n         preserving interests bought and paid for in\n         reliance on judicial decisions, and avoiding\n         the pains that attend any effort to\n         unscramble an egg -- are so plain and so\n         compelling that courts fill the interstices\n         of the Code with the same approach.\n\n20 F.3d at 769. Thus, the court seemed to say that the\nBankruptcy Code contains an \"interstice\" -- a gap -- regarding\nthe circumstances under which an appeal that might upset a plan\nof reorganization may be pursued. Further, the court appeared to\nsuggest that the federal courts have the authority to create a\nrule of federal common law to fill this gap. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Little Lake Misere Land Co., Inc., 412 U.S. 580, 593\n(1973) (referring to the \"`power in the federal courts to\ndeclare, as a matter of common law or \"judicial legislation,\"\nrules which may be necessary to fill in interstitially or\notherwise effectuate the statutory patterns enacted in the large\nby Congress'\") (citation omitted).\n         This is an interesting theory, but I find it\nunnecessary to decide in this case whether it is correct. For\npresent purposes, what is important is to note that, even if this\ntheory is correct, it has nothing to do with mootness. Instead,\nit concerns a federal common law rule designed to promote certain\npolicies of chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. These policies\nare the facilitation of reorganizations and the protection of\nthose who reasonably rely on reorganization plans. As I explain\nbelow, neither of these policies justifies what has happened in\nthis case -- the refusal of the Article III courts to entertain a\nlive appeal over which they indisputably possess statutory\njurisdiction and in which meaningful relief can be awarded.\n\n                                   II.\n\f         A. How can the objective of preserving the Continental\nreorganization justify what the majority has done? The Trustees\nare not seeking to upset the plan of reorganization; rather, they\nare attempting to obtain payments that they claim are due to them\npursuant to that plan. Moreover, even if the success of the\nreorganization might be imperilled if the Trustees obtained the\nfull relief that they are seeking -- an empirical proposition\nthat is not self-evident -- the courts could surely fashion some\nmeasure of lesser relief that would not disturb the\nreorganization. In order to justify its decision, which slams\nthe courthouse door on the Trustees before they are even heard on\nthe merits, the majority would have to show that the Trustees\ncould not be awarded any relief -- not one dollar -- without\nupsetting the Continental reorganization, and obviously they\ncannot do any such thing. I do not dispute the desirability of\npreserving the Continental reorganization, but to my mind this\nobjective implicates a question of remedy, to be decided after\nthe merits of the Trustees' arguments are addressed, and not a\nthreshold question of \"mootness.\"\n         In treating this as a threshold question, the majority,\nI believe, has been confused by the misleading term \"equitable\nmootness,\" which, as I have discussed, does not actually involve\nmootness at all. The federal courts are accustomed to\nconsidering questions of Article III mootness, and the majority,\nin my view, has fallen into the trap of thinking that the\nquestion of \"equitable mootness\" that is now before us must be\ntreated as if it were a question of Article III mootness.\nWhether a case is moot in the Article III sense is, of course, a\njurisdictional question, see, e.g., Rosetti v. Shalala, 12 F.3d\n1216, 1223 (3d Cir. 1993), and therefore it is a question that we\nare obligated to resolve before we consider the merits of an\nappeal. See, e.g., United Wire Metal and Machine Health and\nWelfare Fund v. Morristown Memorial Hosp., 995 F.2d 1179, 1190\n(3d Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 382 (1993); Rogin v. Bensalem\nTp., 616 F.2d 680, 684 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S.\n1029 (1981). Moreover, if we conclude that an appeal is moot in\nthis sense, we have little remedial flexibility; we generally\nhave no choice but to dismiss. See, e.g., U.S. Bancorp Mortgage\nCo. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 115 S. Ct. 386, 389-90 (1994);\nMills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895) (when \"an event occurs\nwhich renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide\nthe case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual\nrelief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment,\nbut will dismiss the appeal\").\n         By contrast, the doctrine that is involved here --\nwhich is not really a doctrine of mootness at all -- does not\ndemand or justify similar treatment. It does not present a\njurisdictional question; we are not required to consider it\nbefore proceeding to the merits; and even if we find that it is\napplicable, it does not necessarily dictate that we dismiss the\nappeal or affirm in its entirety a district court order of\ndismissal. Rather, we retain the ability to craft, or to\ninstruct the district or bankruptcy courts to craft, a remedy\n\fthat is suited to the particular circumstances of the case.\nThus, a remedy could be fashioned in the present case to ensure\nthat the Continental reorganization is not undermined.\n         B. Much the same is true with respect to the objective\nof protecting reasonable reliance interests. In my opinion, this\nis also a remedial consideration; if the Trustees win on the\nmerits, the need to protect reasonable reliance interests can be\nfully taken into account in crafting an appropriate remedy. I\nthus see no need to resolve the question of reasonable reliance\ninterests at this time.\n         The majority, however, not only wrongly treats this as\na threshold, rather than a remedial, consideration, but engages\nin an analysis that flies in the face of the language of the plan\nand seems to assume an extraordinary degree of naivete on the\npart of the Investors and the others who are said to have relied\non the plan.\n         I will focus on the Investors because their plight\nlooms large in the majority's analysis. When the Investors\ndecided to invest in the reorganized company, NewCal, they knew\nor should have known that under the reorganization plan NewCal\nwould be required to pay the Trustees' claim if it was ultimately\nallowed. Section 10.1 of the plan provided that NewCal would pay\n\"Allowed Administrative Claims.\" Moreover, in order to persuade\nthe bankruptcy court to reject the Trustees' request that a cash\nreserve be established prior to confirmation to cover their\nclaim, Continental argued that such a reserve was unnecessary\nbecause if the Trustees' claim was allowed it would be \"an\nAllowed Administrative Claim which would be paid in accordance\nwith the terms of Section 10.1 of the Plan.\" JA 1039.    Under\nthese circumstances, any prudent investor, in deciding whether to\ninvest in NewCal on particular terms, would have taken into\naccount the range and likelihood of possible outcomes in the\nTrustees' appeal, including the possibility that some or all of\nthe amount sought by the Trustees would have to be paid as an\nadministrative claim pursuant to Section 10.1 of the plan. No\nreasonable investor would have proceeded on the assumption that\nthe Trustees would definitely recover nothing. And the same is\ntrue of the other parties that relied on the plan.   Thus, I am\nskeptical about the reliance interests that are claimed here, but\nin any event I fail to see why this issue needs to be resolved at\nthe threshold of this case rather than at the remedial stage, if\nthat stage is ever reached.\n         C. One final aspect of the majority opinion warrants a\nresponse, and that is the majority's discussion of the Trustees'\nfailure to seek or obtain a stay. I have two comments regarding\nthis discussion.\n         First, while it might be desirable to have a rule that\nflatly requires a stay whenever a party takes an appeal that\nmight upset a plan of reorganization, neither the Bankruptcy Code\nnor the Bankruptcy Rules contain any such sweeping provision; our\ncourt had not adopted any such rule at the time of the Trustees'\nappeal (and, indeed, still has not done so); and it would\nconsequently be unfair to apply such a rule to the Trustees\nretroactively.\n\f         Second, in the absence of such a blanket rule, we\nshould focus on whether the purposes that would be served by a\nstay require that the Trustees be thrown out of court at the\nthreshold. The purpose of a stay in this context is to prevent\ntransactions that might otherwise occur in reliance on the plan\nof reorganization and that would be difficult or painful to undo\nif the appeal were to succeed. Accordingly, the Trustees'\nfailure to obtain a stay in this case might limit the relief that\nwould be available to them if they succeeded on the merits of\ntheir appeal, but it cannot justify the refusal at the outset\neven to consider their arguments.\n         In sum, I believe that the Trustees' claim should be\nentertained on the merits. The mere act of entertaining that\nclaim would not imperil Continental's reorganization or impair\nany legitimate reliance interests. If the Trustees' claim were\nconsidered and they won on the merits, any threat to the\nreorganization or to legitimate reliance interests could be taken\ninto account in framing the Trustees' relief. What the district\ncourt and the majority have done -- throwing the Trustees out of\ncourt before the merits of their claim are even heard -- is\nunjustified and unjust.\n         For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would\nreverse the order of the district court and remand for a decision\non the merits.\n\f",

Those appeals were from orders of the bankruptcy court\nwhich 1) denied the Trustees' Renewed Motion for adequate\nprotection, 2) confirmed Continental's revised second amended\njoint plan of reorganization, and 3) denied the Trustees' motion\nfor the establishment of a cash deposit of $123,479,287. In\nessence, the Appellant Trustees seek payment for an asserted\nadministrative claim of approximately $117 million against the\nreorganized company. The Appellee, Continental Airlines, Inc.,\ndefends the district court's decision to dismiss the Trustees'\nappeal and argues, in the alternative, that the underlying\n\frulings of the bankruptcy court were correct as a matter of law\nand fact.\n                               I.\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n         Continental filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on\nDecember 3, 1990. Appellant Trustees serve as successor\nCollateral and Series Trustees for certificate holders who had\nprovided Continental with operating capital. The certificates\nwere secured at the time of Continental's petition by a pool of\n29 commercial aircraft with engines, and 81 additional jet\nengines which, we were advised, serviced about one-third of\nContinental's operating fleet. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the\ndebtor in possession, which has most of the rights, powers,\nfunctions and duties of a trustee, see 11 U.S.C.   1107(a), \"may\nuse property of the estate in the ordinary course of business\nwithout notice or a hearing.\" 11 U.S.C.    363(c)(1).\n         Section 363(e) provides:\n         Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at\n         any time, on request of an entity that has an interest\n         in property used . . . by the [debtor in possession],\n         the court, with or without a hearing, shall prohibit or\n         condition such use . . . as is necessary to provide\n         adequate protection of such interest.\n11 U.S.C.   363(e).\n         On February 21, 1991, First Fidelity Bank of New\nJersey, predecessor to NationsBank as Collateral Trustee, filed a\nmotion along with many other aircraft lessors and financiers\nalleging, inter alia, a decline in the value of the collateral\nand seeking adequate protection under section 363(e). First\nFidelity later withdrew from this motion, but on June 28, 1991\nit, and the predecessors of the other Appellant Trustees, filed a\nmotion seeking similar relief. The bankruptcy court held an\nevidentiary hearing on the motion from September 3 through\nSeptember 6, 1991 limited to the Trustees' assertion that they\nwere entitled to adequate protection payments as a result of the\ncollateral's post-petition decline in market value.\n         Continental argued, inter alia, that because the\nTrustees had not filed a motion for relief from the automatic\nstay, they were not entitled to an award of adequate protection\nunder section 363(e). The motion remained pending in the\nbankruptcy court until August 27, 1992 when the court ruled on\nthe Trustees' motion, rejecting Continental's legal argument but\nfinding as a fact, based on the \"Blue Books,\" a publication\nissued by a company that appraises aircraft, that the market\nvalue of the collateral had not declined during the period at\nissue in the motion. In re Continental Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529840\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529840/matter-of-continental-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Bankr. D. Del. 1992) [hereinafter Continental I].\n         Approximately two weeks before the bankruptcy court\nissued that opinion, the Trustees filed their first motion under\nsection 362(d) of the Bankruptcy Code to lift the automatic stay\n(\"Lift-Stay Motion\"). See 11 U.S.C.    362(d). This section\npermits a creditor to move for relief from the automatic stay of\ndelineated activities, such as repossession of collateral,\neffected by section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\f         On September 14, 1992, the Trustees also filed a\nrenewed motion for adequate protection for alleged decline in the\ncollateral's value for the period after September 1991, when the\noriginal 1991 motion was argued (\"Renewed Motion\"). There were\nvarious hearings on the Renewed Motion between November 3, 1992\nand February 5, 1993. Toward the end of that period, the\nTrustees filed a motion dated January 29, 1993, asking the\nbankruptcy court to establish a cash deposit of some $123\nmillion, of which $117 million was attributable to alleged market\ndecline, to preserve what the Trustees claimed was the\nadministrative priority status of the Trustees' adequate\nprotection claim if Continental emerged from bankruptcy as a\nreorganized debtor (\"Deposit Motion\").\n         During this period efforts to reorganize the debtor\ncontinued. On November 9, 1992 Continental entered into an\nInvestment Agreement under which the Investors (Air Partners,\nL.P. and Air Canada) agreed and committed to an investment of\n$450 million in the reorganized entity under a complex\narrangement and subject to certain conditions. App. at 391 et\nseq. One of those conditions, and the one most relevant to this\nproceeding, was a limitation on the amount and nature of\nliabilities and administrative expense claims required to be\nassumed by or attributable to the reorganized company. App. at\n408. On January 13, 1993 Continental filed a second amended\njoint plan of reorganization (\"Plan\") which referenced that\nInvestment Agreement. The Plan provided, inter alia, for\nassumption of \"allowed administrative claims\" by the reorganized\nContinental. App. at 656.\n         The confirmation hearing was held for a number of days\nduring the period March 16, 1993 through April 16, 1993. The\nparties reached a settlement on April 12 concerning adequate\nprotection due to use and/or maintenance of the collateral by\nContinental, and no issue relating to use decline (the impairment\nin value attributable to the use of the collateral by the debtor\nin possession) is before us. However, the parties did not settle\nthe Trustees' adequate protection claims based on decline in\nmarket value.\n         At the conclusion of the confirmation hearing on April\n16, 1993, the bankruptcy court denied the Deposit Motion and the\nRenewed Motion. In a published opinion, the bankruptcy court\nheld that it was necessary for the Trustees to have sought relief\nfrom the automatic stay to be entitled to adequate protection for\nmarket value decline; that therefore the Trustees were not\nentitled to adequate protection due to market decline until after\nthe date of their Lift-Stay Motion, i.e. August 14, 1992; and\nthat no decline in the market value of the collateral had taken\nplace since that date.

D. Del. 1993) [hereinafter Continental II].\nAlso on April 16, 1993, the bankruptcy court signed the\nConfirmation Order. The court made a series of detailed findings\nof fact and conclusions of law underlying the Confirmation Order\nwhich will be referred to throughout this opinion when pertinent.\n         On April 20, 1993 the Trustees filed three notices of\n\fappeal to the district court from the bankruptcy court's denial\nof the Renewed Motion for Adequate Protection, its denial of the\nDeposit Motion, and its order confirming the Plan. Two days\nlater, the Trustees filed a motion for a partial stay of the\nconsummation of the Plan (\"Conditional Stay Motion\"), but filed\nthat motion in the district court, which referred them to the\nbankruptcy court. On April 26, 1993, the Trustees filed that\nstay request in the bankruptcy court. Because the bankruptcy\njudge was not available, the hearing on the motion was held the\nnext day in the district court, which stated, without explanation\nor analysis, that the Trustees were likely to prevail on their\nappeal to the district court, but denied the stay because the\n\nTrustees were \"unable to post a bond satisfactory to the Court.\"\nApp. at 1755-56. The Trustees did not then make any effort to\nseek any emergency relief from this court. With no stay impeding\nimplementation of the Plan which had now been confirmed, the\nInvestors proceeded to close the transaction by making their\npromised investment.\n         On May 6, 1993 Continental filed a motion in the\ndistrict court to dismiss the Trustees' appeals as moot, which\nthe district court granted on December 30, 1993. The Trustees\nfiled a motion for rehearing and reconsideration in light of the\ndecision in Frito-Lay, Inc. v. LTV Steel Co., Inc. (In re\nChateaugay Corp.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658305\"><a href=\"/opinion/658305/in-re-chateaugay-corporation-reomar-inc-ltv-corporation-ltv-steel/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1993) [hereinafter\nChateaugay II], which the court denied. The Trustees then filed\na timely notice of appeal. This court has jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C.   158(d).\n         A panel of this court heard argument on September 15,\n1995 and issued an opinion that affirmed the district court's\norder by a two-to-one vote. The Trustees petitioned for\nrehearing, and the in banc court voted to rehear the appeal.\nUnder this court's Internal Operating Procedures, the opinion of\nthe panel issued February 7, 1996 was withdrawn.\n\n                               II.\n                            DISCUSSION\n                                A.\n         This court has not addressed the interesting and\nchallenging questions raised by the bankruptcy court's holding\nthat a creditor must file a motion to lift the automatic stay as\na prerequisite to seeking adequate protection. The Trustees\nargue that the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law and that\nthis court can decide the issue de novo even though it was not\nreached by the district court. They further argue that the\nbankruptcy court's finding that there was no diminution in the\nmarket value of the Trustees' collateral after they filed their\nLift-Stay Motion was clearly erroneous. Finally, they argue that\nthe bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law in denying their\nmotion for the establishment of a cash deposit.\n         Not surprisingly, Continental, as appellee, defends\nboth the bankruptcy court's legal determination that the Trustees\ncould not assert adequate protection claims for alleged market\nvalue decline during the period before they moved for relief from\n\fthe automatic stay and its factual conclusion that there had been\nno substantial decline in the value of the collateral since the\nLift-Stay Motion was filed. Finally, it argues that in any event\nthe Trustees could not recover for adequate protection because\nthe value of the collateral did not decline below its value on\nthe petition date, which Continental contends is the relevant\nmeasure.\n         We would reach these issues only if we were satisfied\nthat the district court erred in holding that the Trustees'\nappeals to it were \"moot,\" a decision as to which the parties\nvigorously disagree. Mootness vel non of the appeals before the\ndistrict court is closely related to, if not indistinguishable\nfrom, the question whether the appeal to this court is moot, an\nissue which Continental alludes to in its brief. For\nconvenience, we will refer to mootness in the district court\nunless we state otherwise.\n         Continental does not contend that the appeals to the\ndistrict court or to us were moot in the constitutional sense,\nimplicating the case or controversy requirement of Article III,\n1.

It is evident that \"equitable mootness\" is an inapt\ndescription of the doctrine at issue here.

Instead, they rely most\nheavily on a decision of the Second Circuit holding that even\nthough the reorganization plan for the bankrupt LTV Corporation\nhad been confirmed, the appeal of tax lessors challenging the\nplan's failure to give their claims administrative priority was\nnot moot.

A particular case may also raise\nlegal and/or factual issues interspersed with the prudential\nones, and then the applicable review standard, plenary or clearly\nerroneous, will apply.\n         The dissent argues that the cases cited above are\ninapposite because the district court acted as an appellate court\nand that we should therefore use plenary review. However, the\nproposition that when an appellate court reviews a lower court's\nbalancing of prudential factors, it does so under an abuse of\n\fdiscretion standard as long as the factors considered are not\ninappropriate as a matter of law is a general one applicable in\nall fields, not excluding bankruptcy. As the Fifth Circuit noted\nin a bankruptcy case:\n         In this particular case, we are reviewing the decision\n         of the district court in its capacity as an appellate\n         court. Several different standards of review govern\n         our decision, depending on the nature of the holdings\n         reviewed. Where the disputed holding involves a matter\n         that is within the district court's discretion, we will\n         affirm the judgment of a district court acting in its\n         appellate role unless the court has clearly abused its\n         discretion.\n\nMatter of HECI Exploration Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515195\"><a href=\"/opinion/515195/in-the-matter-of-heci-exploration-co-inc-successor-in-interest-to/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519\n(citations omitted).\n                                B.\n         Factors that have been considered by courts in\ndetermining whether it would be equitable or prudential to reach\nthe merits of a bankruptcy appeal include (1) whether the\nreorganization plan has been substantially consummated, (2)\nwhether a stay has been obtained, (3) whether the relief\nrequested would affect the rights of parties not before the\ncourt, (4) whether the relief requested would affect the success\nof the plan, and (5) the public policy of affording finality to\nbankruptcy judgments. See Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039; Rochman, 963\nF.2d at 471-72. The Trustees have not taken issue with our\nidentification of these factors.\n         Although these five factors have been given varying\nweight, depending on the particular circumstances, the foremost\nconsideration has been whether the reorganization plan has been\nsubstantially consummated. This is especially so where the\nreorganization involves intricate transactions, see Rochman, 963\nF.2d at 473-74 (performance under plan involved \"numerous complex\narrangements\"); Roberts Farms, 652 F.2d at 797 (plan involved\n\"many intricate and involved transactions\" and reversal of plan's\nconfirmation \"would knock the props out from under\" such\ntransactions and \"create an unmanageable, uncontrollable\nsituation for the Bankruptcy Court\"), or where outside investors\nhave relied on the confirmation of the plan, see Manges, 29 F.3d\nat 1039 (equitable mootness \"protects the interests of non-\nadverse third parties who are not before the reviewing court but\nwho have acted in reliance upon the plan as implemented\"); UNR\nIndus., 20 F.3d at 770 (\"[b]y protecting the interests of persons\nwho acquire assets in reliance on a plan of reorganization, a\ncourt increases the price the estate can realize ex ante, and\nthus produces benefits for creditors in the aggregate\"); Rochman,\n963 F.2d at 474 (reorganization involved $1.5 billion in\nfinancing from 100,000 sources); Club Assocs., 956 F.2d at 1070\n(\"a number of investors, who were not parties to this case, had\ncommitted new funds to the 'reemerged Club' with the expectation\nof receiving a preferred return on their investments\").\n         \"Substantial consummation\" is defined in the Bankruptcy\nCode as: \"(A) transfer of all or substantially all of the\n\fproperty proposed by the plan to be transferred; (B) assumption\nby the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of\nthe business or of the management of all or substantially all of\nthe property dealt with by the plan; and (C) commencement of\ndistribution under the plan.\" 11 U.S.C.    1101(2). In such\ninstances, the strong public interest in the finality of\nbankruptcy reorganizations is particularly compelling.\n\n         The district court dismissed the Trustees' appeals to\nit as \"moot\" based on the conclusions, set forth in its opinion\ndated December 30, 1993, that substantial consummation of the\nPlan had occurred, the Investors had already made their $450\nmillion investment into the reorganized entity, all elements of\nthe Plan, except distributions to the unsecured creditors, had\nbeen completed, and a reversal of the order confirming the Plan\nlikely would put Continental back into bankruptcy. App. at 1873.\nThe court also noted that Continental had implemented the Plan\nfollowing its approval by the court because the Trustees had\nfailed to obtain a stay.\n         The Trustees do not challenge that there had been\nsubstantial consummation by December 1993, when the district\ncourt dismissed the appeals as moot. They suggest that as their\nobject is not to disturb the reorganization, but only to get\npayment from the reorganized Continental for their adequate\nprotection claim measured by the market value decline of the\ncollateral during bankruptcy, the line of cases upon which\nContinental relies is inapplicable. We cannot agree, because the\nrejection of the Trustees' claim by the bankruptcy court was\ninextricably intertwined with the implementation of the\nreorganization. See AOV Indus., 792 F.2d at 1148 (to evaluate\nmootness, court must \"scrutinize each individual claim, testing\nthe feasibility of granting the relief against its potential\nimpact on the reorganization scheme as a whole\"). Thus, the\nTrustees cannot avoid the effect of the substantial consummation\nof the reorganization plan so readily.\n         Inasmuch as Continental agrees that the issue is not\nconstitutional mootness but prudential mootness, we will assume\narguendo that even after substantial or total consummation of its\nreorganization, some effective relief would have been available\nfor the Trustees' claim at the time they appealed to the district\ncourt, and on appeal to this court. Even before the in banc\ncourt, Continental has not challenged that assumption. It is\nquite another matter in light of the substantial, indeed\nirrevocable, change in the status quo that followed confirmation\nto determine that it would have been prudent for the court to\nreach the merits of the Trustees' claim. For the district court\nhad before it an unstayed bankruptcy reorganization plan, and\nmany courts have based their prudential decisions to decline to\nconsider challenges to bankruptcy court orders on the ground that\nthere has been substantial consummation of a plan of\nreorganization in reliance upon an unstayed confirmation order.\nSee, e.g., Rochman, 963 F.2d at 475.\n         In Chateaugay I, the court noted that although the\nBankruptcy Code only requires a stay pending appeal in limited\n\fcircumstances, there is a procedure under Bankruptcy Rule 8005 to\nseek to preserve the status quo and \"[t]he party who appeals\nwithout seeking to avail himself of that protection does so at\nhis own risk.\" 988 F.2d at 326. And in In re Manges, the court\nobserved, under the descriptive title \"Halting the Runaway Train:\nthe Motions to Stay,\" that \"in many of the cases in which\nbankruptcy appeals were dismissed as moot, the appellants failed\nto seek a stay.\" 29 F.3d at 1039.\n         Even the seeking of a stay may not be enough. The\nappellants in In re UNR Industries had sought a stay, albeit\nunsuccessfully, at every opportunity; nonetheless, the court\nnoted, \"[a] stay not sought, and a stay sought and denied, lead\nequally to the implementation of the plan of reorganization.\" 20\nF.3d at 770; accord AOV Indus., 792 F.2d at 1144, 1146-47.\n         Shortly after the confirmation of the Continental Plan,\nthe Trustees filed an Emergency Motion for Conditional Stay of\nOrder Confirming the Plan pending their appeal to the district\ncourt. The condition the Trustees sought in lieu of a stay was\nthe establishment of a segregated account for $117 million, the\nfull amount of their adequate protection claim, or alternatively\nat least $22 million, which they claim was the admitted decline\nin the value of the collateral. See App. at 1721. In response\nto the district court's inquiry, they conceded that they were not\nwilling to post any bond. The district court never required a\nsupersedeas bond in the amount of $450,000,000, as the Trustees\nhave suggested. In fact, the district court tried to ascertain\nthe amount of bond that would be reasonable, and the Trustees'\ngeneral position was that they were \"merely the fiduciary of the\nmoney of their bondholders\" and they suggested no lesser amount.\nApp. at 1729.\n         Thus, as one of the reasons for its order denying the\nstay, the district court noted the unwillingness of the Trustees\nto post a bond satisfactory to the court. App. at 1756. See,\ne.g., Central States, 841 F.2d at 95 (appellant's failure to post\nbond to stay confirmation order basis for finding appeal moot).\nBecause the failure to post the bond needed to get a stay\npermitted the consummation of the plan, this factor weighs\nheavily in favor of the district court's declination to delve\ninto the merits of the Trustees' appeal.\n         The Trustees argue that this court has held that\nfailure to obtain a stay does not necessarily render an appeal\nmoot. The cases to which they refer are not apposite. In one,\nIn re Joshua Slocum Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1990), the issue\nwas the narrow one of the power of the bankruptcy court to excise\na paragraph from a shopping center lease. There is no indication\nin Slocum that there had been any confirmation of a plan before\nor during the appeal.\n         In the more recent case to which the Trustees refer,\nMegafoods Stores, Inc. v. Flagstaff Realty Assocs. (In re\nFlagstaff Realty Assocs.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700449\"><a href=\"/opinion/700449/in-re-flagstaff-realty-associates-ta-fra-limited-partnership-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1995), the\nappeal also presented a narrow landlord-tenant issue, i.e. the\neffect of confirmation of the landlord's plan on a tenant's right\nto pursue its appeal of the bankruptcy court's denial of its\nrecoupment claim. In holding that it was not necessary for the\n\ftenant to seek a stay in order to pursue its right to appeal\ndespite the confirmation in the interim, we noted the line of\ncases placing recoupment and setoff in a special category and\nstated, \"although we recognize the importance of maintaining the\nintegrity of confirmed plans from later attack, these unique\ncircumstances permit the plan to be reopened and readjusted.\"\nId. at 1036. Thus, neither Flagstaff nor Slocum addressed the\nequitable or prudential mootness considerations at issue here.\n          High on the list of prudential considerations taken\ninto account by courts considering whether to allow an appeal\nfollowing a consummated reorganization is the reliance by third\nparties, in particular investors, on the finality of the\ntransaction. See Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039 (\"[t]he concept of\n'mootness' from a prudential standpoint protects the interests of\nnon-adverse third parties who are not before the reviewing court\nbut who have acted in reliance upon the plan as implemented\");\nRochman, 963 F.3d at 474-75 (similar). Here, the record is\nreplete with evidence that the Investors relied on the bankruptcy\ncourt's unstayed Confirmation Order in making the decision to\nproceed to close the transaction and that an essential factor in\nthat decision was the bankruptcy court's disallowance of the\nTrustees' adequate protection claim.\n         The Plan of reorganization provided that the\nreorganized Continental would pay \"Allowed Administrative\nClaims.\" App. at 656, 691 (Plan     5.5, 10.1). Among the\nadministrative claims that were still disputed at the time of the\nconfirmation hearing were several large claims, including, in\nparticular, labor claims by airline pilots, large claims by\nEastern Airlines, and the Trustees' claim for adequate protection\nbased on alleged market decline of the collateral. App. at 1223,\n1346. One of the concerns of the Investors that needed to be\nsatisfied as a condition of their participation was that the\ntotal amount that would have to be paid for allowed\nadministrative claims could be distorted by a few such large\nclaims. To limit their exposure, the Investment Agreement\nprovided that the Investors' obligation to proceed with the\narrangements was subject, inter alia, to the payments and\nobligations for administrative claims being no higher than a\nspecified amount, or \"cap.\" App. at 408.\n         At the confirmation hearing, Continental's expert\nwitness testified that if the claims of the Airline Pilots and\nthe Trustees were excluded, the total allowed administrative\nclaims payable under the Plan would be close to the cap, and that\nif the Trustees' claim were allowed, the cap would be exceeded,\nallowing the Investors to walk away from the deal. App. at 1223-\n24, 1333-38. Based on this testimony, Continental argued to the\nbankruptcy court that the feasibility determination required for\nconfirmation under 11 U.S.C.   1129(a)(11) would turn in part on\nthe adjudication of the Trustees' still outstanding\nadministrative claim. App. at 1400. Continental therefore urged\nthe court to incorporate its adjudication of the Trustees' claim\ninto the Confirmation Order itself, asserting that the Investors\nwould not go forward with the deal \"unless there is an order upon\nwhich they can place reliance, which is going to be a plan\n\fconfirmation order.\" App. at 1400. The Trustees argued against\nincorporation, taking the position that even though the amount of\nthe adequate protection claim allowed by the court would be\nrelevant to the court's subsequent determination of feasibility,\nthe adjudication of the claim itself was a separate matter from\nplan confirmation. App. at 1401.\n         The bankruptcy court ultimately took the approach urged\nby Continental, incorporating into its Confirmation Order its\ndecision denying the Trustees' adequate protection claim. As\npart of its feasibility determination, it explicitly found that\nneither the pilots' claims nor the Eastern claims was entitled to\nadministrative priority, and that the Trustees' adequate\nprotection claim had no value as an administrative claim. App.\nat 1549-51. On that basis, it found that there was substantial,\ncredible and uncontested evidence that the administrative claims\npayable at confirmation -- excluding the claims of the pilots,\nEastern, and the Trustees -- would be within the specified limit\nof the cap set forth in the Investment Agreement, App. at 1548,\nnoting that the adjudications of the Trustees' claim and the\nEastern claims were \"crucial to the willingness of the Investors\nto consummate the Financing Transaction.\" App. at 1550.\n         We are unwilling to accept the Trustees' suggestion,\nimplicit in their briefs and made explicit at oral argument, that\nthe bankruptcy court's ruling on the merits of their adequate\nprotection claim was colored by a so-called \"ultimatum\" from\nContinental that if the claim were granted the Investors would\nabandon the reorganization. See In Banc Argument Transcript at 3.\nThe Trustees offer no evidence in support of this suggestion, and\nwe certainly would not lightly impute such a motive to the\nbankruptcy court. In effect, the Trustees are challenging the\nInvestors' right to condition their investment on the amount of\napproved administrative claims. This was never raised below at\nthe time of the Investment Agreement, the ultimate confirmation\nor the period between. We know of no statute, rule or precedent\nthat would deny investors the right to limit their investments on\nthe existence of conditions which they believe give the newly\nreorganized company a reasonable opportunity to succeed -- such\nas, in this case, without being weighed down by excessive\nadministrative expenses.\n         The Trustees also argue that Continental's position at\nthe confirmation hearing, that the adjudication of the Trustees'\nclaim should be incorporated into the Confirmation Order, was a\n\"ploy\" to \"disingenuously\" use the fact of such incorporation to\n\"manufactur[e] the appearance of mootness.\" Appellants' Brief at\n3; In Banc Argument Transcript at 1. Their characterization of\nContinental's position as a \"ploy\" implies that it had no\nlegitimate reason. In light of the integral nexus between the\nfeasibility of confirmation and the adjudication of the Trustees'\nclaim, it appears that the suggestion of incorporation urged by\nContinental and adopted by the bankruptcy court was reasonable\nand reflected the inescapable fact that the Trustees' claim and\nthe confirmation of the Plan were inextricably intertwined,\nrather than an attempt to \"manufacture\" the appearance of\nequitable mootness.\n\f         In dismissing the Trustees' appeals as moot, the\ndistrict court specifically found that the Investors had relied\non the bankruptcy court's unstayed Confirmation Order and that\nthere was an integral nexus between the investment and the\nsuccess of the Plan. The court stated, \"[t]he Investors relied\non the unstayed Confirmation Order in making the $450 million\ninvestment in Continental's Plan. It is clear that [the\nTrustees'] requested relief would undermine the grounds which the\nInvestors relied upon in making their investment and would\nrequire a dismantling of the entire Plan.\" App. at 1874.\nAlthough the Trustees argue that this finding is erroneous, there\nis support for it in the record.\n         At the hearing in April 1993 before the district court\non the Trustees' request for the conditional stay of the\nConfirmation Order, counsel for the Trustees stated they had\ntestimony that \"as a matter of business judgment, it would be\nextremely unlikely for the investors to walk away from this deal\nif . . . a 22-million-dollar deposit was established.\" App. at\n1727. The Trustees' counsel in effect challenged the Investors\nto assert otherwise, stating that inasmuch as the Investors'\ncounsel were in court they could correct any assertions that he\nmade. Id.    Thereafter, the Investors' attorney rose \"to make\nclear the [I]nvestors' position, which is that if the relief is\ngranted to [the Trustees] which they seek from the Court this\nmorning [the stay conditioned on a deposit of some $22 million to\n$117 million], then we are not prepared to close the\ntransaction.\" App. at 1744.\n         The representative of the Investors explained that in\nthe airline business \"there is a great sensitivity to cash and\nthe capital structure of a reorganized entity,\" and that the\nrelief that the Trustees sought \"could significantly impair the\ncapital structure that would exist with respect [to] this\nreorganized airline.\" Id. at 1744-45. He reviewed the\nnegotiations that had occurred for the cap for administrative\nexpense liability, advised that the Investors had monitored on a\nmonthly basis Continental's performance in that respect, and\nexplained that the Investors had insisted that the Confirmation\nOrder address the issue of the Trustees' claim \"because we want\nto make sure if we are putting our money in, we are getting the\nbenefit of our bargain, which is a reorganized entity with a\ncapital structure that we contemplated.\" App. at 1746. He\nconcluded by stating unequivocally that if a stay were entered\nconditioned upon the bond the Trustees sought, then his client\n\"would not be prepared to close this transaction.\" Id. The\nTrustees' counsel did not thereafter argue that the Investors'\ncounsel's statements were insufficiently probative, and therefore\nthat suggestion here is less than persuasive.\n         The Trustees have not contested here that if their\nclaim for market value decline of the collateral (a claim\nindependent of their claim for the use and maintenance of the\ncollateral, which has been satisfied) had been approved as an\nadministrative claim, the total such administrative claim would\nhave greatly exceeded the cap specified by the Investors for that\npurpose. This would have given the Investors the option to\n\fwithdraw; such withdrawal would have placed the entire Plan in\njeopardy. By the time the district court ruled on the appeal, it\nwas no longer possible to restore the parties to their earlier\npositions because the investment had been made, and the option to\nwithdraw was no longer available to the Investors. See Specialty\nEquip., 3 F.3d at 1049 (claim held moot when its acceptance\n\"would amount to imposing a different plan of reorganization on\nthe parties\"). Thus, the third factor bearing on the prudential\ndetermination whether to reach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal\nafter confirmation and in the absence of a stay -- the effect of\nthe requested relief on the rights of parties not before the\ncourt -- weighs heavily against the Trustees.\n         This factor cannot fairly be recast as whether the\nInvestors or others reasonably relied on the prediction that the\nTrustees would recover nothing on their claim. While we agree\nthat reliance of the Investors and others on the unstayed\nConfirmation Order is of central importance to our analysis, to\nfocus on the \"reasonableness\" of that reliance, at least as\nmeasured by the likelihood of reversal on appeal, is necessarily\na circular enterprise and therefore of little utility. Whether\nthe Investors were reasonable in relying on the bankruptcy\ncourt's order depends on whether this was a case that would be\nconsidered on the merits on appeal or would be dismissed on the\nbasis of the doctrine often referred to as \"equitable mootness.\"\nAnd whether this case would be dismissed on \"equitable mootness\"\ngrounds on appeal in turn depends on whether the Investors\nreasonably relied. Thus, placing the focus on the reasonableness\nof the Investors' reliance as measured by the probability that\nContinental would prevail on appeal sets up a straw man which is\neasily knocked down.\n         Our inquiry should not be about the \"reasonableness\" of\nthe Investors' reliance or the probability of either party\nsucceeding on appeal. Rather, we should ask whether we want to\nencourage or discourage reliance by investors and others on the\nfinality of bankruptcy confirmation orders. The strong public\npolicy in favor of maximizing debtors' estates and facilitating\nsuccessful reorganization, reflected in the Code itself, clearly\nweighs in favor of encouraging such reliance. Indeed, the\nimportance of allowing approved reorganizations to go forward in\nreliance on bankruptcy court confirmation orders may be the\ncentral animating force behind the equitable mootness doctrine.\nSee Rochman, 963 F.2d at 471-72; Metro Property Mgmt. Co. v.\nInformation Dialogues, Inc.

Where, as here, investors and\nother third parties consummated a massive reorganization in\nreliance on an unstayed confirmation order that, explicitly and\nas a condition of feasibility, denied the claim for which\nappellate review is sought, the allowance of such appellate\nreview would likely undermine public confidence in the finality\nof bankruptcy confirmation orders and make successful completion\nof large reorganizations like this more difficult. This is true\nregardless of whether the Investors' reliance was \"reasonable\" or\nbased on a 30%, 60%, or 100% probability of success on appeal, an\nissue raised at the oral argument.\n\f         In arguing against dismissal here on the basis of\nprudential considerations, the Trustees repeatedly rely on their\nassertion that the Plan contained \"a built-in mechanism for the\n[post-confirmation] disposition and payment of Disputed\nAdministrative Claims.\" Appellants' Brief at 10. On the basis\nof this provision, they argue that they had no obligation to take\nsteps to preserve the status quo through a stay, that their\nappeal is not moot because \"some effective relief\" is available,\nand that the Plan is contractually \"binding\" on Continental.\nThey conclude that the district court therefore erred in\n\"permitt[ing] Continental to escape its 'contractual' obligations\nunder the Plan under the guise of the mootness doctrine.\"\nAppellant's Brief at 20. While the Trustees' description of the\n\"mechanism\" provided in the Plan is technically correct, they\noverstate the impact of that mechanism.\n         Under the definitions in the Plan, the Trustees' claim\nwas a \"Disputed Administrative Claim\" because it sought adequate\nprotection payments, see App. at 623-24 (Plan    1.4(vi)) and was\nthe subject of a timely objection, see App. at 632 (Plan\n1.85(a)). The Plan requires the reorganized Continental to pay\nallowed administrative claims on the later of: the effective\ndate of confirmation or \"the fifth Business Day after such Claim\nis Allowed.\" App. at 691 (Plan    10.1). Further, the Plan\nprovides that \"[a] Disputed Claim shall be an Allowed Claim if,\nand only to the extent that, such Disputed Claim has been Allowed\nby a Final Order,\" App. at 623 (Plan    1.5), and defines a \"Final\nOrder\" as \"[a]n order which is no longer subject to appeal,\ncertiorari proceeding or other proceeding for review or\nrehearing, and as to which no [such proceeding is] pending,\" App.\nat 635 (Plan   1.100).\n         Thus, the Plan imposes an obligation on the reorganized\nContinental to pay disputed administrative claims once they\nbecome allowed by a final order of court, even if such final\norder does not occur until after confirmation. If the bankruptcy\ncourt's disallowance of the Trustees' claim were to be reversed\non appeal, the Plan appears to provide a \"mechanism\" for payment\nof the claim by the reorganized Continental. The mere\navailability of such a mechanism, however, which may prevent\ndismissal on the ground of Article III constitutional mootness,\ndoes not warrant reversal of the district court's order\ndismissing it on prudential grounds. As we have noted, the\ndistrict court's \"mootness\" determination was based not on a\nfinding that no effective relief was available, but rather on the\nfinding that in light of all the circumstances, it would be\ninequitable to grant relief. Nor has any \"contractual\nobligation\" been violated either by Continental or the district\ncourt. Where, as here, there has been no order, final or\notherwise, allowing the Trustees' disputed administrative claim,\nthe Plan imposes no obligation on the reorganized Continental to\npay it.\n         Finally, the Plan provisions allowing for post-\nconfirmation payment of allowed claims in no way obviated the\nTrustees' obligation to seek a stay. Here, where the\nconfirmation of the Plan and the willingness of the Investors to\n\fgo forward turned on the bankruptcy court's denial of the\nTrustees' claims, and where the denial of those claims was in\nfact incorporated into the Confirmation Order, there was a clear\npossibility that the Trustees' claims would become moot after\nconsummation of the Plan, and it was therefore incumbent on the\nTrustees to obtain a stay. Indeed, the record shows that all\nparties were well aware of the extensive legal precedent\ndismissing as moot or on equitable grounds appeals from unstayed\nconsummated reorganizations. See App. at 410 (references in the\nInvestment Agreement); App. at 1729-30, 1741 (argument before the\ndistrict court on the stay).\n         For similar reasons, we fail to see the inconsistency\ncharged by the Trustees between Continental's current position\nas to \"equitable mootness\" and its argument to the bankruptcy\ncourt in response to the Trustees' Deposit Motion that the Plan\nwould require payment of the Trustees' claim by the reorganized\nContinental if and when allowed. See App. at 1039. As noted\nabove, the Plan imposes no obligation on Continental in the\nabsence of a final order allowing the Trustees' claim, and the\nmere availability of a mechanism for granting relief does not\nmean the court cannot determine that in light of all the\ncircumstances it should not even try to unscramble the eggs.\n         Moreover, at the time Continental argued against the\nDeposit Motion the bankruptcy court had not yet ruled disallowing\nthe Trustees' claim nor cited that as an explicit basis for its\nfeasibility determination in confirming the plan. Accordingly,\nContinental did not yet have reason to know that the claim would\nbe denied and become subject to \"equitable mootness\" on appeal.\nAs soon as the basis for this mootness argument became apparent,\nContinental repeatedly asserted its intention to make such an\nargument if an appeal was filed and no stay obtained. App. at\n1691, 1742.\n         The Trustees have not presented us with any arguments\nwhich would weigh against all of the prudential considerations\nthat dictate that this consummated reorganization must be left in\nplace. Following confirmation, Continental was operating as a\nrestructured company, and had entered into countless new\nrelationships and transactions. To convince a court to take the\naction sought by the Trustees which would undermine the basis for\nthe Investors' decision to proceed, the Trustees would have to\nproffer a powerful reason indeed. They have not even attempted\nto do so.\n         Arrayed against that silence are the facts that the\nreorganization plan was consummated, no stay was obtained,\nnumerous other parties have changed their positions, and numerous\nirrevocable transactions have since been completed as a result of\nthe consummation of the Plan. Without listing all of such\ntransactions set forth by Continental in its brief, we note that\namong those are the distribution to unsecured creditors, the\nmerger of 53 debtors other than Continental with and into\nContinental, the investment of $110 million in cash by Air\nPartners and Air Canada in the reorganized Continental, the\ntransfer by foreign governments of various route authorities, and\nthe assumption by the reorganized Continental of unexpired leases\n\fand executory contracts worth over $5.0 billion. Thus, the key\nissue really is whether the district court abused its discretion\nin weighing the various equitable factors. We are not prepared\nto hold that the balance reached by the district court was an\nabuse of its discretion.\n         Under the circumstances presented here, we can see no\nprudential considerations that would support an attempt by an\nappellate court, district or court of appeals, to fashion even a\nlimited remedy for the Trustees. That would necessarily entail\nimposing a new debt on the reorganized company, which is a\ndifferent entity than it was when this case was before the\ndistrict court. Thus, we agree with the determination of the\ndistrict court to dismiss the Trustees' claim. We base our\nholding on our conclusion that it would be neither prudent nor\nequitable to grant the Trustees the relief they seek.\n                               III.\n                            CONCLUSION\n         For the reasons set forth we will affirm the order of\nthe district court.\n\nIn Re: Continental Airlines\nNo. 94-7748\n\n\n\n\nALITO, Circuit Judge, dissenting, joined by Judges Becker,\nGreenberg, Lewis, McKee and Sarokin.\n\n\n         The majority's decision in this case creates a bad\nprecedent for our circuit. The majority adopts the curious\ndoctrine of \"equitable mootness,\" which it interprets as\npermitting federal district courts and courts of appeals to\nrefuse to entertain the merits of live bankruptcy appeals over\nwhich they indisputably possess statutory jurisdiction and in\nwhich they can plainly provide relief. According to the\nmajority, there is no clear rule for determining when a\nbankruptcy appeal is \"equitably moot.\" Instead, this is said to\nbe a discretionary determination to be made in the first instance\nby the district court based on a weighing of five factors that\nthe majority has culled from the opinions of our \"sister\ncircuits.\" In my view, if the doctrine of \"equitable mootness\"\nhas any validity, it is more limited than the majority holds.\n          The dangers inherent in the majority's adoption and\nbroad interpretation of this doctrine are illustrated by this\ncase. In simple terms, this is what happened. After filing for\nrelief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, Continental\nAirlines continued to use certain aircraft and jet engines that\nwere held as collateral entrusted to the Trustees. Believing\nthat their collateral was undergoing a dramatic diminution in\nvalue, the Trustees in August 1992 filed a renewed motion in the\nbankruptcy court seeking \"adequate protection\" under 11 U.S.C.\n363(e). During the next eight months, while the Continental\n\freorganization plan proceeded toward confirmation, the bankruptcy\ncourt did not rule on this motion. In March 1993, Continental\ninsisted that the bankruptcy court rule on the Trustees' motion\nat the same time that it confirmed the plan, and Continental told\nthe bankruptcy judge that unless the motion was denied, the\nprospective investors in the reorganized corporation would\nwithhold funding, and the reorganization would not go forward.\nSee Continental Br. at 5-6 & n.1. Furthermore, Continental took\nthe position that if the plan was confirmed and went into effect,\nany appeal would be moot. See Continental Br. at 21. The\nbankruptcy court then simultaneously denied the Trustees' motion\nand entered the order confirming the plan. The Trustees\nexercised their statutory right to appeal to the district court,\nand in my view the need for review by an Article III court is\nparticularly acute when the challenged ruling of the bankruptcy\ncourt is made under circumstances such as these.\n         The Trustees, however, have been utterly denied such\nreview. In the initial level of appeal, the district court\nopined that the Trustees probably would have won if the merits of\ntheir appeal had been reached (JA 1755-56), but the district\ncourt dismissed their appeal as moot. Likewise, the majority of\nour court describes the Trustees' arguments as \"interesting and\nchallenging\" (Maj. Op. at 9) but then throws them out of court\nwithout reaching the merits of their arguments. And the majority\ndoes this even though (a) this case is clearly not \"moot\" in any\nproper sense of the term, (b) we unquestionably have statutory\njurisdiction, and (c) we have a \"virtually unflagging obligation\"\nto exercise the jurisdiction that we have been given.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n817 (1976). I am puzzled and troubled by what the majority has\ndone.\n\n                                   I.\n\n         As the majority notes, the Trustees have not contested\nthe existence of the doctrine of \"equitable mootness,\" and in\nlight of the Trustees' position, I think that it is appropriate\nto assume the existence of this doctrine for purposes of this\nappeal. The majority opinion, however, does not simply assume\nthe existence of this doctrine but adopts it as part of the law\nof our circuit. In doing so, the majority does not undertake an\nindependent analysis of the origin or scope of the doctrine but\nis instead content to rely on the decisions of other courts of\nappeals. From these decisions, the majority extracts five\nfactors, which are to be weighed by the district court in the\ninitial level of appeal for the purpose of determining whether\nthe appeal is \"equitably moot.\" Maj. Op. at 14. These factors\nare: \"(1) whether the reorganization plan has been substantially\nconsummated, (2) whether a stay has been obtained, (3) whether\nthe relief requested would affect the rights of parties not\nbefore the court, (4) whether the relief requested would affect\nthe success of the plan, and (5) the public policy of affording\nfinality to bankruptcy judgments.\" Maj. Op. at 15.\n         I am not convinced that the majority's test is\n\fconsistent with the law of all of the circuits that the majority\nclaims to be following. For example, the Eleventh Circuit holds\nthat the proper test is \"whether the `reorganization plan has\nbeen so substantially consummated that effective relief is no\nlonger available.'\" In re Club Associates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1069\n(11th Cir. 1992) (quoting Miami Center Ltd.

This inquiry\nseems quite different from the majority's indeterminate five-\nfactor test. But even if the majority's analysis is supported by\nthe decisions it cites, and even though I think that those\ndecisions deserve careful and respectful consideration, I think\nthat the in banc majority should have made an independent\nexamination of the basis and scope of the doctrine of \"equitable\nmootness\" before engraving it in our circuit's law.\n         What is the basis of this doctrine? As the majority\nacknowledges, it does not stem from the \"case-or-controversy\"\nrequirement of Article III. See Maj. Op. at 10. For example, it\nis not argued that the case now before us is moot in the Article\nIII sense.\n         Nor does it appear that this doctrine is rooted in non-\nArticle III mootness decisions \"reflect[ing] avowedly flexible\ndoctrines of remedy and judicial administration.\" 13A Charles\nAlan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, and Edward H. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure   3533.1 at 222 (1984). These doctrines\nare said to focus on the question whether \"granting a present\ndetermination of the issues offered, and perhaps the entry of\nmore specific orders, will have some effect in the real world.\"\nId. at   3533.1 at 226 (footnote omitted). Here, it is clear\nthat a determination of the merits of the issues raised by the\nTrustees and the entry of a remedial order on the basis of such a\ndetermination would have \"some effect\" -- and potentially quite a\nsubstantial effect -- in the real world. (That is precisely why\nContinental does not want us to entertain the appeal!)\n\n         Thus, as this case well illustrates, the doctrine of\n\"equitable mootness\" is not really about \"mootness\" at all in\neither the Article III or non-Article III sense. As the Seventh\nCircuit stated in a passage that the majority quotes with\napproval (see Maj. Op. at 12), \"[t]here is a big difference\nbetween inability to alter the outcome (real mootness) and\nunwillingness to alter the outcome (`equitable mootness').

Added by a 1976 amendment to the rule, the\nprovision in question stated:\n         Unless an order approving a sale of property\n         or issuance of a certificate of indebtedness\n         is stayed pending appeal, the sale to a good\n         faith purchaser or the issuance of a\n         certificate to a good faith holder shall not\n         be affected by the reversal or modification\n         of such order on appeal, whether or not the\n         purchaser or holder knows of the pendency of\n         the appeal.\n\n         Although I do not find the Roberts Farms opinion\nentirely clear, I think that the best reading of the opinion is\nthat the challenge to the plan of reorganization in that case\ncould not be entertained because no relief was practicable as a\nresult of the many post-confirmation transactions that were\nirreversible due to this provision of former Rule 805. See 652\nF.2d at 797. In any event, whether or not this is what the\nRoberts Farms court meant to say, I do not see how any broader\nrule could reasonably be extracted from the provision of former\nBankruptcy Rule 805 on which the Roberts Farms court relied or\nfrom the analogous provisions now contained in 11 U.S.C.\n363(m) and 364(e). If one begins with narrow provisions such as\nthese -- which merely prevent the upsetting of certain specific\ntransactions if stays are not obtained -- I do not see how one\ncan derive the broad doctrine of \"equitable mootness\" that the\nmajority in this case appears to embrace.\n         What apparently happened, however, was that the holding\nof Roberts Farms was gradually extended well beyond anything that\ncould be supported by the authority on which Roberts Farmsrested.\nSubsequent cases first cited Roberts Farms in support of\nthe proposition that a bankruptcy appeal cannot be entertained if\nthe court could not grant \"effective relief.\" See, e.g., In re\nInformation Dialogues, Inc., 662 F.2d at 477. Later, Roberts\nFarms was interpreted more expansively to mean that an appeal\ncould not be entertained if a court could not award relief that\nwas \"equitable.\" See In re Chateaugay Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602355\"><a href=\"/opinion/602355/bankr-l-rep-p-75161-in-re-chateaugay-corporation-reomar-inc-and-ltv/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324\n(2d Cir. 1993) (citing Roberts Farms). And this latter holding\nfigures prominently in the majority's analysis. See Maj. Op. at\n12. In my view, this gradual but ultimately quite substantial\nextension of Roberts Farms cannot be squared with the narrow\nauthority on which that decision relied. Accordingly, if\nanything like the majority's decision in this case is to be\ndefended, some other foundation for the doctrine of \"equitable\nmootness\" must be found.\n         The second possible basis for the doctrine of\n\"equitable mootness\" is suggested in In re UNR Indus., supra,\nwhere the Seventh Circuit wrote:\n              Several provisions of the Bankruptcy\n         Code of 1978 provide that courts should keep\n         their hands off consummated transactions.\n         For example, 11 U.S.C.   363(m) says that the\n         reversal of an order authorizing the sale or\n\f         lease of property of an estate \"does not\n         affect the validity of a sale or lease under\n         such authorization to an entity that\n         purchased or leased such property in good\n         faith, whether or not such entity knew of the\n         pendency of the appeal.\" Unless the sale is\n         stayed pending appeal, the transaction\n         survives even if it should not have been\n         authorized in the first place.

Thus, the court seemed to say that the\nBankruptcy Code contains an \"interstice\" -- a gap -- regarding\nthe circumstances under which an appeal that might upset a plan\nof reorganization may be pursued. Further, the court appeared to\nsuggest that the federal courts have the authority to create a\nrule of federal common law to fill this gap. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Little Lake Misere Land Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108819\"><a href=\"/opinion/108819/united-states-v-little-lake-misere-land-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593\n(1973) (referring to the \"`power in the federal courts to\ndeclare, as a matter of common law or \"judicial legislation,\"\nrules which may be necessary to fill in interstitially or\notherwise effectuate the statutory patterns enacted in the large\nby Congress'\") (citation omitted).\n         This is an interesting theory, but I find it\nunnecessary to decide in this case whether it is correct. For\npresent purposes, what is important is to note that, even if this\ntheory is correct, it has nothing to do with mootness. Instead,\nit concerns a federal common law rule designed to promote certain\npolicies of chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. These policies\nare the facilitation of reorganizations and the protection of\nthose who reasonably rely on reorganization plans. As I explain\nbelow, neither of these policies justifies what has happened in\nthis case -- the refusal of the Article III courts to entertain a\nlive appeal over which they indisputably possess statutory\njurisdiction and in which meaningful relief can be awarded.\n\n                                   II.\n\f         A. How can the objective of preserving the Continental\nreorganization justify what the majority has done? The Trustees\nare not seeking to upset the plan of reorganization; rather, they\nare attempting to obtain payments that they claim are due to them\npursuant to that plan. Moreover, even if the success of the\nreorganization might be imperilled if the Trustees obtained the\nfull relief that they are seeking -- an empirical proposition\nthat is not self-evident -- the courts could surely fashion some\nmeasure of lesser relief that would not disturb the\nreorganization. In order to justify its decision, which slams\nthe courthouse door on the Trustees before they are even heard on\nthe merits, the majority would have to show that the Trustees\ncould not be awarded any relief -- not one dollar -- without\nupsetting the Continental reorganization, and obviously they\ncannot do any such thing. I do not dispute the desirability of\npreserving the Continental reorganization, but to my mind this\nobjective implicates a question of remedy, to be decided after\nthe merits of the Trustees' arguments are addressed, and not a\nthreshold question of \"mootness.\"\n         In treating this as a threshold question, the majority,\nI believe, has been confused by the misleading term \"equitable\nmootness,\" which, as I have discussed, does not actually involve\nmootness at all. The federal courts are accustomed to\nconsidering questions of Article III mootness, and the majority,\nin my view, has fallen into the trap of thinking that the\nquestion of \"equitable mootness\" that is now before us must be\ntreated as if it were a question of Article III mootness.\nWhether a case is moot in the Article III sense is, of course, a\njurisdictional question, see, e.g., Rosetti v. Shalala, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1223 (3d Cir. 1993), and therefore it is a question that we\nare obligated to resolve before we consider the merits of an\nappeal. See, e.g., United Wire Metal and Machine Health and\nWelfare Fund v. Morristown Memorial Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190\n(3d Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993); Rogin v. Bensalem\nTp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375509\"><a href=\"/opinion/375509/sharon-l-rogin-and-michael-r-rogin-ann-mangano-and-wm-mangano-janet/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1029</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981). Moreover, if we conclude that an appeal is moot in\nthis sense, we have little remedial flexibility; we generally\nhave no choice but to dismiss. See, e.g., U.S. Bancorp Mortgage\nCo. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117879\"><a href=\"/opinion/117879/us-bancorp-mortgage-co-v-bonner-mall-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389-90 (1994);\nMills v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620957\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620957/mills-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (1895) (when \"an event occurs\nwhich renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide\nthe case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual\nrelief whatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment,\nbut will dismiss the appeal\").\n         By contrast, the doctrine that is involved here --\nwhich is not really a doctrine of mootness at all -- does not\ndemand or justify similar treatment. It does not present a\njurisdictional question; we are not required to consider it\nbefore proceeding to the merits; and even if we find that it is\napplicable, it does not necessarily dictate that we dismiss the\nappeal or affirm in its entirety a district court order of\ndismissal. Rather, we retain the ability to craft, or to\ninstruct the district or bankruptcy courts to craft, a remedy\n\fthat is suited to the particular circumstances of the case.\nThus, a remedy could be fashioned in the present case to ensure\nthat the Continental reorganization is not undermined.\n         B. Much the same is true with respect to the objective\nof protecting reasonable reliance interests. In my opinion, this\nis also a remedial consideration; if the Trustees win on the\nmerits, the need to protect reasonable reliance interests can be\nfully taken into account in crafting an appropriate remedy. I\nthus see no need to resolve the question of reasonable reliance\ninterests at this time.\n         The majority, however, not only wrongly treats this as\na threshold, rather than a remedial, consideration, but engages\nin an analysis that flies in the face of the language of the plan\nand seems to assume an extraordinary degree of naivete on the\npart of the Investors and the others who are said to have relied\non the plan.\n         I will focus on the Investors because their plight\nlooms large in the majority's analysis. When the Investors\ndecided to invest in the reorganized company, NewCal, they knew\nor should have known that under the reorganization plan NewCal\nwould be required to pay the Trustees' claim if it was ultimately\nallowed. Section 10.1 of the plan provided that NewCal would pay\n\"Allowed Administrative Claims.\" Moreover, in order to persuade\nthe bankruptcy court to reject the Trustees' request that a cash\nreserve be established prior to confirmation to cover their\nclaim, Continental argued that such a reserve was unnecessary\nbecause if the Trustees' claim was allowed it would be \"an\nAllowed Administrative Claim which would be paid in accordance\nwith the terms of Section 10.1 of the Plan.\" JA 1039.    Under\nthese circumstances, any prudent investor, in deciding whether to\ninvest in NewCal on particular terms, would have taken into\naccount the range and likelihood of possible outcomes in the\nTrustees' appeal, including the possibility that some or all of\nthe amount sought by the Trustees would have to be paid as an\nadministrative claim pursuant to Section 10.1 of the plan. No\nreasonable investor would have proceeded on the assumption that\nthe Trustees would definitely recover nothing. And the same is\ntrue of the other parties that relied on the plan.   Thus, I am\nskeptical about the reliance interests that are claimed here, but\nin any event I fail to see why this issue needs to be resolved at\nthe threshold of this case rather than at the remedial stage, if\nthat stage is ever reached.\n         C. One final aspect of the majority opinion warrants a\nresponse, and that is the majority's discussion of the Trustees'\nfailure to seek or obtain a stay. I have two comments regarding\nthis discussion.\n         First, while it might be desirable to have a rule that\nflatly requires a stay whenever a party takes an appeal that\nmight upset a plan of reorganization, neither the Bankruptcy Code\nnor the Bankruptcy Rules contain any such sweeping provision; our\ncourt had not adopted any such rule at the time of the Trustees'\nappeal (and, indeed, still has not done so); and it would\nconsequently be unfair to apply such a rule to the Trustees\nretroactively.\n\f         Second, in the absence of such a blanket rule, we\nshould focus on whether the purposes that would be served by a\nstay require that the Trustees be thrown out of court at the\nthreshold. The purpose of a stay in this context is to prevent\ntransactions that might otherwise occur in reliance on the plan\nof reorganization and that would be difficult or painful to undo\nif the appeal were to succeed. Accordingly, the Trustees'\nfailure to obtain a stay in this case might limit the relief that\nwould be available to them if they succeeded on the merits of\ntheir appeal, but it cannot justify the refusal at the outset\neven to consider their arguments.\n         In sum, I believe that the Trustees' claim should be\nentertained on the merits. The mere act of entertaining that\nclaim would not imperil Continental's reorganization or impair\nany legitimate reliance interests. If the Trustees' claim were\nconsidered and they won on the merits, any threat to the\nreorganization or to legitimate reliance interests could be taken\ninto account in framing the Trustees' relief. What the district\ncourt and the majority have done -- throwing the Trustees out of\ncourt before the merits of their claim are even heard -- is\nunjustified and unjust.\n         For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would\nreverse the order of the district court and remand for a decision\non the merits.\n\f</pre>",
