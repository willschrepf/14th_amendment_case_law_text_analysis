Following Judge Kozinski’s retirement, Judge W.\nFletcher was drawn by lot to replace him. Ninth Circuit General Order\n3.2.h. Judge W.

AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n                          SUMMARY **\n\n\n         Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act\n\n    The en banc court vacated the district court’s summary\njudgment in favor of defendant AgriCap Financial Corp. in\nan action brought by produce growers under the Perishable\nAgricultural Commodities Act, and remanded for further\nproceedings.\n\n    The growers sold their perishable agricultural products\non credit to Tanimura Distributing, Inc., a distributor, which\nmade Tanimura a trustee over a PACA trust holding the\nperishable products and any resulting proceeds for the\ngrowers as PACA-trust beneficiaries. Tanimura sold the\nproducts on credit to third parties and transferred the\nresulting accounts receivable to AgriCap through a\ntransaction AgriCap described as a “Factoring Agreement”\nor sale of accounts. Tanimura’s business later failed, and the\ngrowers did not receive payment in full from Tanimura for\ntheir products.\n\n    The growers sued AgriCap, alleging: (1) that the\nFactoring Agreement was merely a secured lending\narrangement structured to look like a sale; (2) that the\naccounts receivable and proceeds, therefore, remained trust\nproperty under PACA; (3) that because the accounts\nreceivable remained trust property, Tanimura breached the\nPACA trust and AgriCap was complicit in the breach; and\n(4) that under PACA the PACA-trust beneficiaries,\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It\nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                  5\n\nincluding the growers, held an interest superior to that of any\nsecured lender. Hence, AgriCap was liable to the growers to\nrepay the value of the accounts receivable.\n\n    Joining other circuits, the en banc court adopted a\nthreshold “true sale” test to determine whether assets\ntransferred in transactions that are labeled “sales” remain\nassets of a PACA trust. The en banc court held that a court\nmust conduct a two-step inquiry when determining whether\nthe questioned transaction is a sale or creates a security\ninterest, i.e., a loan. First, a court must apply a threshold true\nsale test of which the transfer-of-risk is a key, but not the\nsole, factor. If a court concludes that there was a true sale, it\nmust then determine if the transaction was commercially\nreasonable. To the extent that its opinion contradicted\nBoulder Fruit Express & Heger Organic Farm Sales v.\nTransp. Factoring, Inc., 251 F.3d 1268 (9th Cir. 2001), the\nen banc court overruled Boulder Fruit.\n\n    On remand, the district court should determine whether\nthe transaction at issue was a true sale or a lending\nagreement.\n\n    Dissenting, Judge Ikuta, joined by Judges Hurwitz and\nFriedland, wrote that the majority’s conclusion—that if a\nPACA trustee borrows money from a lender in order to pay\nthe growers, but the money runs out before all the growers\nare paid, then the lender has an obligation to make the unpaid\ngrowers whole—is unmoored from both the text of PACA\nand settled principles of trust law.\n\f6      G.W.

PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                       7\n\n                            OPINION\n\nGOULD, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Appellant produce growers (“Growers”) 1 sold their\nperishable agricultural products on credit to a distributor,\nTanimura Distributing, Inc. (“Tanimura”). Under the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act (“PACA”),\n7 U.S.C. §§ 499a–499s, this arrangement made Tanimura a\ntrustee over a PACA trust holding the perishable products\nand any resulting proceeds for Growers as PACA-trust\nbeneficiaries. Tanimura sold the agricultural products on\ncredit to third parties. It then transferred the resulting\naccounts receivable to Appellee AgriCap Financial\n(“AgriCap”) through a transaction AgriCap describes as a\n“Factoring Agreement” or sale of accounts. 2\n\n    Although described as a sale of accounts, the Factoring\nAgreement involved some hallmarks of a secured lending\narrangement: AgriCap referred to itself as “Lender,” and the\nwritten agreement was entitled “AgriCap Financial\nCorporation Factoring and Security Agreement.” Further,\nAgriCap was granted security interests in accounts\nreceivable and all other asset classes except inventory; UCC\nfinancing statements were filed; other debts were\nsubordinated; and there was a measure of recourse for\n\n    1\n       Growers are tomato suppliers whose various lawsuits against\nTanimura Distributing, Inc. were consolidated into one case before the\ndistrict court.\n\n    2\n       Factoring is “the commercial practice of converting receivables\ninto cash by selling them at a discount.” Boulder Fruit Express & Heger\nOrganic Farm Sales v. Transp. Factoring, Inc., 251 F.3d 1268, 1271 (9th\nCir. 2001) (citing Black’s Law Dictionary (7th ed. 1999)).\n\f8       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nAgriCap against Tanimura if AgriCap could not collect from\nTanimura’s customers—for example, AgriCap was entitled\nto force Tanimura to “repurchase” accounts that remained\nunpaid after 90 days, and AgriCap could enforce this right\nby withholding payments from Tanimura.\n\n    The central dispute in this case developed after\nTanimura’s business failed, and Growers did not receive full\npayment from Tanimura for their produce. 3 Growers sued\nAgriCap alleging: (1) that the Factoring Agreement was\nmerely a secured lending arrangement structured to look like\na sale; (2) that the accounts receivable and proceeds,\ntherefore, remained trust property under PACA; (3) that\nbecause the accounts receivable remained trust property,\nTanimura breached the PACA trust and AgriCap was\ncomplicit in the breach; and (4) that under PACA the PACA-\ntrust beneficiaries, including Growers, held an interest\nsuperior to that of any secured lender. Hence, AgriCap was\nliable to Growers to repay the value of the accounts\nreceivable.\n\n    AgriCap moved for summary judgment arguing that,\nunder Boulder Fruit Express & Heger Organic Farm Sales\nv. Transportation Factoring, Inc., 251 F.3d 1268 (9th Cir.\n2001), a trustee is allowed to remove assets from the trust in\nany commercially reasonable way without breaching the\ntrust. And, it argued, the factoring agreement was\ncommercially reasonable, like the one upheld in Boulder\nFruit. Growers acknowledged that a PACA trustee\ngenerally may sell PACA-trust assets on commercially\nreasonable terms without breaching trust duties. They\n\n    3\n      Tanimura owed Growers more than $800,000 when Tanimura\nceased operation.\n\f           G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                        9\n\nargued, however, that under precedents from the Second,\nFourth and Fifth Circuits, 4 a court should not review the\ncommercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement unless\nand until the court first determines that a true sale actually\noccurred. 5 According to Growers, a true sale only occurs\nwhen a PACA trustee transfers not only the right to collect\nthe underlying accounts, but also the risk of non-payment on\nthose accounts. 6\n\n\n\n    4\n       See Nickey Gregory Co. v. Agricap, LLC, 597 F.3d 591, 598 (4th\nCir. 2010); Reaves Brokerage Co., Inc. v. Sunbelt Fruit & Vegetable Co.,\nInc., 336 F.3d 410, 414 (5th Cir. 2003); and Endico Potatoes, Inc. v. CIT\nGroup/Factoring, Inc., 67 F.3d 1063, 1067–69 (2d Cir. 1995).\n    5\n       See, e.g., Reaves Brokerage, 336 F.3d at 414 (holding that the\n“[c]haracterization of the agreement at issue turns on the substance of\nthe relationship” and “not simply the label attached to the transaction,”\nand concluding that the relationship “was that of a secured lender and\ndebtor, not a seller and buyer” (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)).\n    6\n        The Second Circuit described the transfer-of-risk test as follows:\n\n           Where the lender has purchased the accounts\n           receivable, the borrower’s debt is extinguished and the\n           lender’s risk with regard to the performance of the\n           accounts is direct, that is, the lender and not the\n           borrower bears the risk of non-performance by the\n           account debtor. If the lender holds only a security\n           interest, however, the lender’s risk is derivative or\n           secondary, that is, the borrower remains liable for the\n           debt and bears the risk of non-payment by the account\n           debtor, while the lender only bears the risk that the\n           account debtor’s non-payment will leave the borrower\n           unable to satisfy the loan.\n\nEndico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1069.\n\f10      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    The district court described the cited cases as a circuit\nsplit and granted summary judgment in favor of AgriCap\nrelying on Boulder Fruit. The district court reasoned that the\nNinth Circuit in Boulder Fruit expressly addressed the\ncommercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement but\nimplicitly rejected a separate, transfer-of-risk test. The\ndistrict court further reasoned that the factoring agreement\nin Boulder Fruit transferred even less risk than did the\nFactoring Agreement here—in Boulder Fruit, the factoring\nagent enjoyed unrestricted discretion to force the distributor\nto repurchase accounts. The district court concluded that,\neven if Boulder Fruit could accommodate the transfer-of-\nrisk test, the facts of Boulder Fruit controlled and precluded\nrelief for Growers. The district court finally concluded that\nthe Factoring Agreement was commercially reasonable\nbecause AgriCap paid Tanimura 80% of the face value of the\naccounts, an amount that has never been found to be\nunreasonable, as an up-front payment and AgriCap\nultimately paid Tanimura an even greater percentage of the\nface value of the transferred accounts.\n\n    On appeal, Growers argued to the three-judge panel that\nwe are not bound by Boulder Fruit because Boulder Fruit\ndid not discuss the transfer-of-risk test, leaving open the\nquestion of whether that test should apply in the Ninth\nCircuit. AgriCap countered by contrast with its argument\nthat Boulder Fruit settled the issue because the PACA-trust\nbeneficiaries in Boulder Fruit asked the Court to apply the\ntransfer-of-risk test; the parties in that case briefed the issue;\nthe issue was squarely before the Court; and yet, the Court\ndid not apply the test.\n\n    The three-judge panel agreed with the district court’s\nconclusion that Boulder Fruit controlled the outcome in this\ncase. S & H Packing & Sales Co., Inc. v. Tanimura Distrib.,\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                    11\n\nInc., 850 F.3d 446, 450–51 (9th Cir.), reh’g en banc granted,\n868 F.3d 1047 (9th Cir. 2017); see Arizona v. Tohono\nO’odham Nation, 818 F.3d 549, 555 (9th Cir. 2016); see also\nUnited States v. Lucas, 963 F.2d 243, 247 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(noting that subsequent panels are bound by prior panel\ndecisions and only the en banc court may overrule panel\nprecedent). The three-judge panel reasoned that had the\nBoulder Fruit court not implicitly rejected the transfer-of-\nrisk test, the holding of the case necessarily would have been\ndifferent. Judge Melloy wrote a separate concurring opinion\nsuggesting that the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, should\neliminate a circuit split and expressly adopt a separate\nthreshold transfer-of-risk test joining several other circuits.\nS & H Packing & Sales Co., 850 F.3d at 451 (Melloy, J.,\nconcurring). 7 A majority of the active judges on this Court\nagreed to rehear this appeal en banc.\n\n                                 I\n\n    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Boulder\nFruit, 251 F.3d at 1270. “We review grants of summary\njudgment de novo.” Balint v. Carson City, Nev., 180 F.3d\n1047, 1050 (9th Cir. 1999). We must determine, viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\nwhether the district court applied the substantive law\ncorrectly. Id.\n\n                                 II\n\n    Although the parties ask us to answer many\nparticularized questions on appeal, we resolve only one\nissue: whether, in the context of determining the assets\n\n    7\n      This opinion is in substantial agreement with arguments made in\nJudge Melloy’s concurrence and draws heavily therefrom.\n\f12      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nincluded in a PACA trust, a court needs to conduct a\nthreshold true sale inquiry before it determines whether a\ntransaction transferring PACA trust assets was a\ncommercially reasonable sale. For the reasons stated below,\nwe join the Second, Fourth and Fifth Circuits in adopting a\nthreshold true sale test to determine whether assets\ntransferred in transactions that are labeled “sales” remain\nassets of a PACA trust. We hold that a court must conduct\na two-step inquiry when determining whether the questioned\ntransaction is a sale or creates a security interest, i.e., a loan.\nFirst, a court must apply a threshold true sale test of which\nthe transfer-of-risk is a key, but not the sole, factor. If a court\nconcludes that there was a true sale, it must then determine\nif the transaction was commercially reasonable. If there was\nnot a true sale, the court’s inquiry stops there and the assets\nremain in the trust. If there was a true sale but the sale was\nnot commercially reasonable, there is a breach of the trust\nand the assets likewise remain in the trust. If, however, the\ncourt concludes that there was a true sale and that the\ntransaction was commercially reasonable, the buyer owns\nthe assets free and clear of the trust. We hold that a district\ncourt should look to the substance of the transaction to\ndetermine whether the transaction is a true sale or a secured\nloan. In doing so, the transfer of risk should be a primary\nfactor to which a court looks.\n\n                               III\n\n    We elaborate on the principles just summarized, with\nreference to pertinent authorities and reasoning.\n\n                                A\n\n    “Congress enacted PACA in 1930 to prevent unfair\nbusiness practices and promote financial responsibility in the\nfresh fruit and produce industry.” Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL             13\n\nat 1270. Congress amended PACA in 1984 “‘to remedy\n[the] burden on commerce in perishable agricultural\ncommodities and to protect the public interest’ caused by\naccounts receivable financing arrangements that ‘encumber\nor give lenders a security interest’ in the perishable\nagricultural commodities superior to the growers.” Id.\n(alteration in original) (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(1)).\nPACA creates a statutory trust in an effort to remedy this\nburden:\n\n       Perishable agricultural commodities received\n       by a commission merchant, dealer, or broker\n       in all transactions, and all inventories of food\n       or other products derived from perishable\n       agricultural      commodities,      and      any\n       receivables or proceeds from the sale of such\n       commodities or products, shall be held by\n       such commission merchant, dealer, or broker\n       in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers\n       or sellers of such commodities or agents\n       involved in the transaction, until full payment\n       of the sums owing in connection with such\n       transactions has been received by such\n       unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents.\n\n7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2). “This provision imposes a ‘non-\nsegregated floating trust’ on the commodities and their\nderivatives, and permits the commingling of trust assets\nwithout defeating the trust.” Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at\n1067 (citation omitted).\n\n   The House Report explaining the 1984 PACA\namendments states:\n\n       [Purchasers/Distributors  of   perishable\n       agricultural commodities] in the normal\n\f14     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n       course of their business transactions, operate\n       on bank loans secured by the inventories,\n       proceeds or assigned receivables from sales\n       of perishable agricultural commodities,\n       giving the lender a secured position in the\n       case of insolvency. Under present law,\n       sellers of fresh fruits and vegetables are\n       unsecured creditors and receive little\n       protection in any suit for recovery of\n       damages where a buyer has failed to make\n       payment as required by contract.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-543 at *3 (1984), as reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 407. The Second Circuit, citing this\nreport, explained:\n\n       According to Congress, due to the need to sell\n       perishable commodities quickly, sellers of\n       perishable commodities are often placed in\n       the position of being unsecured creditors of\n       companies whose creditworthiness the seller\n       is unable to verify. Due to a large number of\n       defaults by the purchasers, and the sellers’\n       status as unsecured creditors, the sellers\n       recover, if at all, only after banks and other\n       lenders who have obtained security interests\n       in the defaulting purchaser’s inventories,\n       proceeds, and receivables.\n\nEndico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1067. Given this history, it is\nevident that our focus should be upon the true nature of the\ntransactions at issue and the true nature of the parties’\nroles—that of seller and buyer or that of secured lender and\nborrower.\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               15\n\n    Perhaps most importantly, Congress intended to shield\nagricultural growers from risk in enacting PACA “to protect\nthe public interest.” 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(1). PACA’s\npurpose is not to give a one-sided boon to growers, but\ninstead, to benefit all parties and society by ensuring that\ngrowers are protected; lenders know their risk; and\nagricultural commerce is encouraged to benefit society.\n\n                              B\n\n     We apply general trust principles to questions involving\nPACA trusts, unless those principles directly conflict with\nPACA.

Because\nordinary principles of trust law apply to trusts created under\nPACA, trust assets are excluded from the bankruptcy estate\nif the PACA trustee goes bankrupt. Sunkist Growers, Inc. v.\nFisher, 104 F.3d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n    A breach of trust occurs when there is “a violation by the\ntrustee of any duty which as trustee he owes to the\nbeneficiary.” Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271 (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Trusts § 201 (1959)). A trustee is\nrequired by federal regulation “to maintain trust assets in a\nmanner that such assets are freely available to satisfy\noutstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural\ncommodities.” Id. (quoting 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(d)(1)). The\nduty to maintain trust assets is far-reaching. Federal\nregulation dictates that “[a]ny act or omission which is\ninconsistent with this responsibility, including dissipation of\ntrust assets, is unlawful and in violation of [PACA].” Id.\n(second alteration in original) (quoting 7 C.F.R.\n§ 46.46(d)(1)). Non-segregated floating trusts under PACA\npermit the commingling of trust assets and allow the PACA\ntrustee to convert trust assets into proceeds. Boulder Fruit,\n251 F.3d at 1272; see also Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1067;\n\f16      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nA&J Produce Corp. v. Bronx Overall Econ. Dev. Corp.,\n542 F.3d 54, 57–58 (2d Cir. 2008). The transferees of trust\nassets, such as AgriCap here, “are liable only if they had\nsome role in causing the breach or dissipation of the trust.”\nBoulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1272; Restatement (Second) of\nTrusts § 283 (1959) (“If the trustee transfers trust property\nto a third person . . . [without] commit[ting] a breach of trust,\nthe third person holds the interest so transferred or created\nfree of the trust, and is under no liability to the beneficiary.”).\n\n                                C\n\n    Against this industry and legal background, a PACA\ntrustee’s true sale of accounts receivable for a commercially\nreasonable discount from the accounts’ face value is not a\ndissipation of trust assets and, therefore, is not a breach of\nthe PACA trustee’s duties. Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 598\n(“The assets of the trust would thus have been converted into\ncash and the receivables would no longer have been trust\nassets. Obviously, under this scenario, [the factoring agent]\nwould own the accounts receivable and would be able to do\nwith them what it wished.”); Reaves Brokerage, 336 F.3d at\n413–14 (holding that “a ‘bonafide purchaser’ of trust assets\nreceives the assets free of claims by trust beneficiaries” and\nnoting that the determinative issue on appeal is whether the\n“factoring agreement” was a loan secured by accounts\nreceivable or a true sale of accounts receivable); Boulder\nFruit, 251 F.3d at 1271–72 (“[N]othing in PACA or the\nregulations prohibits PACA trustees from attempting to turn\nreceivables into cash by factoring. To the contrary a\ncommercially reasonable sale of accounts for fair value is\nentirely consistent with the trustee’s primary duty.”); Endico\nPotatoes, 67 F.3d at 1067–69 (noting that “the well\nrecognized principle from trust law that a bona fide\npurchaser of trust assets receives the assets free of any claim\n\f           G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                   17\n\nby the trust beneficiaries” was determinative, and because\nthe financier had received only a security interest, its interest\nwas subject to the rights of the growers). That sale is, in\nsubstance, a conversion of trust assets from accounts\nreceivable into cash. See Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271.\n\n     The Second, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits have held that any\npurported security interest for a lender in PACA-trust assets\nis inferior to the trust beneficiaries’ claims and rights. See,\ne.g., Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 598–99 (“Thus, if the\naccounts receivable were held by [the factoring agent] as\ncollateral to secure repayment of a loan, they would also\nhave been held for the benefit of produce sellers, and the\nproduce sellers would have effectively enjoyed a first-\ncreditor position in them.”); Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at\n1069 (“Because [the factoring agent] held only a security\ninterest . . . its interest is subject to the rights of the PACA\ntrust beneficiaries. . . . [The factoring agent] must, therefore,\ndisgorge amounts collected on the accounts after [the\ndistributor’s] bankruptcy filing to the extent necessary to\nsatisfy claims of PACA trust beneficiaries.”); A&J Produce,\n542 F.3d at 58 (“A creditor holding ‘only a security interest,’\ntherefore, retains that interest ‘subject to the rights of the\ntrust beneficiaries.’”). Notwithstanding the absence of\ndiscussion of a “true-sale” or “transfer-of-risk” test, even\nBoulder Fruit made clear that a lender’s use of PACA-trust\nassets as collateral to secure a debt could not create a priority\nsecurity interest ahead of the position enjoyed by PACA\ntrust beneficiaries. 8\n\n\n    8\n        The Ninth Circuit stated:\n\n           Farmer sells oranges on credit to Broker. Broker turns\n           around and sells the oranges on credit to Supermarket,\n\f18      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n                                   IV\n\n    The treatment of true sales and security interests under\nPACA and trust law is reasonably clear. But what is at issue\nhere, and is not perfectly clear, is the proper analysis to apply\nwhen the true nature of the transaction is ambiguous—i.e.,\nwhen it resembles a sale in some respects and yet looks like\na secured transaction in others. Growers and the Second,\nFourth, and Fifth Circuits would apply a threshold transfer-\nof-risk test to determine if a transaction is a true sale or is\nmore accurately viewed as a secured lending relationship.\nAgriCap, relying on Boulder Fruit, argues vigorously that\nthe court need only ask if the transaction was commercially\nreasonable.\n\n                                   A\n\n    Boulder Fruit held that factoring agreements do not per\nse breach the PACA trust because “a trustee can sell trust\nassets unless the sale breaches the trust.” 251 F.3d at 1272.\nThe court concluded that “a commercially reasonable sale of\naccounts for fair value is entirely consistent with the\ntrustee’s primary duty under PACA and 7 C.F.R.\n\n        generating an account receivable from Supermarket.\n        Broker then obtains a loan from Bank and grants Bank\n        a security interest in the account receivable to secure\n        the loan. Broker goes bankrupt. Under PACA, Broker\n        is required to hold the receivable in trust for Farmer\n        until Farmer was paid in full; use of the receivable as\n        collateral was a breach of the trust. Therefore,\n        Farmer’s rights in the Supermarket receivable are\n        superior to Bank’s. In fact, as a trust asset, the\n        Supermarket receivable is not even part of the\n        bankruptcy estate.\n\nBoulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271.\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                       19\n\n§ 46.46(d)(1)—to maintain trust assets so that they are\n‘freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers\nof perishable commodities.’” Id. at 1271. Boulder Fruit\nreasoned that the commercial reasonableness of a factoring\nagreement depends upon the terms of the agreement. For\nexample, “[a] PACA trustee who sells accounts for pennies\non the dollar, just to turn a quick buck, might well have\nbreached the PACA trust, while a trustee who factors\naccounts at a commercially reasonable rate would not.” Id.\n\n    The Boulder Fruit panel, in reaching its conclusion, said\nthat the factoring agreement “actually enhanced the trust.”\nId. at 1272. Boulder Fruit considered not only the initial up-\nfront payment from the factoring agent to the distributor but\nalso the actual sums paid to the distributor by the factoring\nagent while performing the factoring agreement. 9 Id.\nBoulder Fruit did not, however, examine the substance of\nthe rights transferred to determine what the factoring agent\nagreed to do, what risk the factoring agent accepted when it\naccepted the right to collect on the transferred accounts, and\nwhether the transaction should properly be deemed a true\nsale rather than a mere secured lending arrangement. Rather,\nBoulder Fruit characterized the transaction as a sale or\nfactoring agreement without discussing the factoring agent’s\nrights and ability to seek recourse against the distributor.\n\n   In sharp contrast, the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits\nfound it necessary to examine the rights and risks transferred\nbetween the parties to a factoring agreement. The courts in\n    9\n      The 20% discount at issue in Boulder Fruit represented a discount\nfrom the accounts’ face value as paid in an initial payment from the\nfactoring agent to the PACA trustee. It did not represent the final amount\npaid nor did it represent a floor or a ceiling on what the factoring\nagreement in Boulder Fruit could have required the factoring agent to\npay.\n\f20      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nthese cases examined the text and legislative history of\nPACA and the regulations promulgated under PACA to\nconclude that Congress intended to promote the interests of\nproduce growers above the interests of secured lenders. See,\ne.g., Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 594–95, 598–99; Endico\nPotatoes, 67 F.3d at 1066–68. The Fourth Circuit stressed\nthat representatives of the secured lending community had\nvoiced concern over PACA’s likely effect upon secured\nlenders and the factoring industry. Nickey Gregory,\n597 F.3d at 599. That court concluded that Congress\nnevertheless found that the balance of policy interests\nfavored placing those lenders in a position inferior to unpaid\ngrowers. Id.\n\n    The Endico Potatoes court resolved a case wherein\nMerberg, a dealer in perishable agricultural commodities\nreceived financing from CIT, and CIT held security interests\nin all Merberg’s assets including accounts receivable.\n67 F.3d at 1066. Merberg went through a bankruptcy and\nthe growers sought reimbursement from CIT for the amounts\nleft unpaid. Id. The court defined the issue before it as\nwhether the transaction between CIT and Merberg\nconstituted a purchase for value or whether the exchange\ngave CIT no more than a security interest. Id. at 1068. The\ncourt reasoned, “[i]n determining the substance of the\ntransaction, the Court may look to a number of factors,\nincluding the right of the creditor to recover from the debtor\nany deficiency if the assets assigned are not sufficient to\nsatisfy the debt, the effect on the creditor’s right to the assets\nassigned if the debtor were to pay the debt from independent\nfunds, whether the debtor has a right to any funds recovered\nfrom the sale of assets above that necessary to satisfy the\ndebt, and whether the assignment itself reduces debt.” Id.\nThat court found, “[t]the root of all of these factors is the\ntransfer of risk.” Id. at 1069. The court relied upon the fact\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                         21\n\nthat the agreement had a provision that let CIT demand\npayment at any time and a provision that terminated CIT’s\ninterest if Merberg paid its outstanding obligation. Id. The\ncourt held that because CIT only held a security interest in\nMerberg’s accounts receivable, CIT’s interest was subject to\nthe rights of the PACA trust beneficiaries. Id.\n\n    A question may be raised whether the Second Circuit no\nlonger espouses the view that the substance of an agreement\nmust be analyzed when determining the rights of the parties.\nIn E. Armata, Inc. v. Korea Commercial Bank of New York,\n367 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit\nconsidered whether, under PACA, a bank was liable to the\nbeneficiaries of a PACA trust for receipt of funds when the\nbank extended revolving overdraft privileges to the produce\ndealer and applied deposited PACA funds to reduce the\nnegative balance in the produce dealer’s overdrawn account.\nId. The court, in concluding that the bank was not liable to\nPACA trust beneficiaries, reasoned that the bank did not\nbreach the trust. Id. at 131; see also American Banana Co.,\nInc. v. Republic Nat’l Bank of NY, N.A., 362 F.3d 33, 42 (2d\nCir. 2004) (“Nor are we convinced that a trustee’s payments\nof commercially reasonable fees and interest in exchange for\nroutine banking services such as check cashing services and\noverdraft privileges extended to facilitate payments to\nbeneficiaries constitute a breach of the PACA trust.”). The\nSecond Circuit in its E. Armata decision, while it cited\nBoulder Fruit for specified purposes, 10 did not purport to\noverrule Endico Potatoes or to limit it.\n\n\n    10\n       Specifically, the court there said in part: “We agree with the Ninth\nCircuit in Boulder Fruit, that it is not a breach of trust for a PACA dealer\nto use PACA funds to enter into ‘commercially reasonable’ transactions\nwith parties not protected by PACA, particularly where such transactions\n\f22      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    A subsequent Second Circuit opinion, A&J Produce\nCorp. v. Bronx Overall Economic Development Corp, held\nthat a lender who had a lien on trust assets held that lien\n“subject to the rights of the trust beneficiaries” i.e., the\ngrowers. 542 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 2008). It further noted\nthat “[a]ny other result would elevate the rights of secured\ncreditors above those of PACA creditors, contrary to the\nintent to the statute. Id. at 59; see also Coosemans\nSpecialties, Inc. v. Gargiulo, 485 F.3d 701, 707 (2d Cir.\n2007) (noting that in E. Armata they did not hold that any\ncommercially reasonable transaction avoids breaching\nfiduciary responsibilities but that “whether a transaction is\ncommercially reasonable is simply one factor that may be\nrelevant in determining whether a PACA trustee has met its\nultimate burden of proving that trust assets remained freely\navailable to plaintiffs”).\n\n    In Reaves, the Fifth Circuit considered a case where\nReaves, a produce seller, sold produce to Sunbelt Fruit &\nVegetable Company, a wholesaler, and Sunbelt ceased\noperations owing Reaves almost $200,000 in unpaid\ninvoices. 336 F.3d at 412. Reaves sued Fidelity Factors,\nLLC, because Fidelity had purchased particular accounts\nreceivable from Sunbelt. Id. The court framed the issue\nbefore it as whether the “factoring agreement” between\nSunbelt and Fidelity was a loan secured by accounts\nreceivable or a sale of accounts receivable. Id. at 414. The\ncourt reasoned that the “[c]haracterization of the agreement\nturns on the ‘substance of the relationship’ between Fidelity\nand Sunbelt, ‘not simply the label attached to the\ntransaction.’” Id. The court looked to the Second Circuit’s\nrisk-transfer analysis and also conducted an independent\n\nfacilitate a PACA dealer’s fulfillment of his obligations to PACA\nbeneficiaries.” Id. at 133.\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL             23\n\nexamination of the substance of the agreement and\nconcluded that the relationship between Fidelity and Sunbelt\nwas that of a secured lender and debtor. Id. The court\nreasoned that the agreement and its provisions, when read in\ntheir entirety, “confirm that the risk of non-payment or\nunderpayment is entirely borne by Sunbelt.” Id. at 415\n(emphasis in original). The court pointed to continuing lien\nand single indebtedness language, a personal guaranty from\nSunbelt’s president, and recordation of the agreement with\nthe UCC to support its conclusion. Id. at 416. The court also\ndistinguished Boulder Fruit because it found that the\ncommercially reasonable analysis did not apply when the\nfactoring agreement is the “functional equivalent” of a\nsecured lending agreement, noting that the “discrete issue\nbefore the Boulder Fruit court was whether an\nacknowledged factoring agreement was ‘commercially\nreasonable’.” Id. at 417 (emphasis in original).\n\n    In Nickey Gregory, the Fourth Circuit addressed a case\nwhere Robison Farms, a distributor of produce, bought\nproduce from growers on short-term credit, and distributed\nthe produce to restaurants and school systems on credit\ncreating accounts receivable. 597 F.3d at 596. When\nRobison Farms began experiencing financial difficulties it\nsought a line of credit from AgriCap and assigned the\naccounts receivable to AgriCap in exchange for an advance\nof 80% of the face value of the accounts. Id. AgriCap\ncollected the accounts receivable, kept the 80% for itself,\nand remitted the remaining 20% to Robison Farms minus\nfees and interest. Id. Notwithstanding the credit agreement,\nRobison Farms closed its doors without paying the growers\nwhat was owing and filed for bankruptcy. Id. at 596–97.\nThe court framed the issue before it as whether the district\ncourt erred in concluding that AgriCap’s transaction was a\nloan agreement. Id at 600. The Fourth Circuit upheld the\n\f24      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the transaction was a loan\nagreement because (1) AgriCap referred to itself as a\n“Lender” and Robison Farms a “Borrower” in the\nagreement, (2) Robison farms did not transfer risk of\nnoncollection of accounts receivable to AgriCap—AgriCap\nhad a right to demand that Robison Farms repurchase any\nreceivable that went unpaid or was disputed, (3) documents\nrelated to the transaction referred to the accounts receivable\nas collateral for repayment, (4) AgriCap had a Subordination\nAgreement that gave it “a first priority security interest in the\nCollateral”, (5) the owner of Robison Farms gave AgriCap a\npersonal guarantee, and (6) AgriCap filed a UCC-1\nFinancing Statement for the transaction. Id. at 601–03. The\ncourt concluded that the substantive aspects of the\ntransaction were inconsistent with a sale of assets, and that\nthe transaction was in “essence a loan in the form of a\nrevolving line of credit secured by accounts receivable.” Id.\nat 603. The court finally concluded that because the\ntransaction was a loan, the accounts receivable and their\nproceeds never left the PACA trust, and their proceeds had\nto be made available for payment of the claims of unpaid\nPACA creditors first. Id.\n\n    The Fourth Circuit distinguished Boulder Fruit\nconcluding that in Boulder Fruit there was a “true factoring\nrelationship, in which the receivables were actually sold to\nthe factor.” Id. at 604. The Fourth Circuit found that\nBoulder Fruit did not question whether there had actually\nbeen a sale. Id. at 604.\n\n    The weight of authority and reasoning in the Second,\nFourth and Fifth Circuit cases suggest that “transfer of risk”\nand “true sale” considerations should be assessed before\nconsidering commercial reasonableness when considering\nthe propriety of a transfer of trust assets. We conclude that\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               25\n\nadoption of the transfer-of-risk test or true sale test is the\nlogical outcome of a reading of PACA, PACA’s legislative\nhistory, and consideration of PACA’s purpose.\n\n                               B\n\n    Given the remedy that Congress created to alleviate the\nperceived problem of conflict in rights of agricultural\ngrowers and secured lenders—creation of the trust elevating\ncommodities sellers’ interests over lenders’ interests—\nCongress’s clear concern with the relative interests of\nsecured lenders and commodities sellers, and the general\ncontours of trust law—in particular, a trustee’s ability to sell\nor convert trust assets—courts must focus on the true\nsubstance of PACA-related transactions and not on artificial\nindicators or labels. It runs counter to PACA and its history\nto allow the simple use of the words “sale,” “purchase,” or\n“factoring agreement” to be central for purposes of assessing\nthe relative rights of lenders and produce growers.\n\n    AgriCap at oral argument asserted that the AgriCap\ntransaction benefitted Growers as AgriCap paid Tanimura\nmore than the 80% discount on the accounts receivable and\nnever used the recourse provision. The Second, Fourth, and\nFifth Circuits conclude, however, that a transfer of the\nprimary or direct risk of non-payment on the accounts is the\nhallmark of a true sale. Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 601–\n03; Reaves Brokerage, 336 F.3d at 417; Endico Potatoes,\n67 F.3d at 1068–69. See also In re Arctic Exp. Inc., 636 F.3d\n781, 800 (6th Cir. 2011) (“The rationale of the Fourth\nCircuit’s decision in Nickey Gregory is transferable to the\ncase at bar, which involves a similar revolving loan\nagreement secured by Arctic’s accounts receivable.”).\nThese courts and PACA regulations assess trust asset\nencumbrance in terms of what a factoring agreement could\nauthorize and not in terms of what money was actually paid\n\f26      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nto the trustee under the agreement. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R.\n§ 46.46(a)(2) (“‘Dissipation’ means any act or failure to act\nwhich could result in the diversion of trust assets or which\ncould prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers,\nsellers, or agents to recover money owed in connection with\nproduce transactions.”).\n\n    In assessing whether a true sale occurred, the Fourth\nCircuit adopted the transfer-of-risk test developed by the\nSecond Circuit in Endico Potatoes. Nickey Gregory,\n597 F.3d at 600–03. There, the Second Circuit distinguished\nbetween direct risk and secondary or derivative risk. Endico\nPotatoes, 67 F.3d at 1068–69. The Endico court said that it\nwas appropriate to examine several factors such as “[1] the\nright of the creditor to recover from the debtor any\ndeficiency if the assets assigned are not sufficient to satisfy\nthe debt, [2] the effect on the creditor’s right to the assets\nassigned if the debtor were to pay the debt from independent\nfunds, [3] whether the debtor has a right to any funds\nrecovered from the sale of assets above that necessary to\nsatisfy the debt, and [4] whether the assignment itself\nreduces the debt.” Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1068. The\ncourt in Endico Potatoes concluded: “The root of all of these\nfactors is the transfer of risk.” Id. at 1069. Finally, the court\nthere summarized:\n\n        Where the lender has purchased the accounts\n        receivable, the borrower’s debt is\n        extinguished and the lender’s risk with regard\n        to the performance of the accounts is direct,\n        that is, the lender and not the borrower bears\n        the risk of non-performance by the account\n        debtor. If the lender holds only a security\n        interest, however, the lender’s risk is\n        derivative or secondary, that is, the borrower\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               27\n\n       remains liable for the debt and bears the risk\n       of non-payment by the account debtor, while\n       the lender only bears the risk that the account\n       debtor’s non-payment will leave the\n       borrower unable to satisfy the loan.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\n    We conclude that this transfer-of-risk test should be\napplied to avoid reliance on labels in factoring agreements\nthat would defeat the purposes of PACA. As Judge Melloy\nreasoned in his separate concurrence in the three-judge\npanel’s decision: “A factoring agent who accepts risk of non-\npayment on the transferred accounts is the owner of the\naccounts, for better or worse . . . [internal citation omitted].\nThat risk will be reflected in the price. A factoring agent\nwho functionally serves only as a lender and collection firm,\nhowever, accepts accounts for collection but enjoys the right\nto force the distributor to repurchase non-performing\naccounts. Such a factoring agent faces much less risk—risk\nmeasured only by the limitations on the repurchase\nprovisions and by the distributor’s solvency and ability to\nperform under the agreement.” S & H Packing & Sales Co.,\n850 F.3d at 457. The price paid for the accounts with and\nwithout recourse will differ.\n\n    AgriCap nevertheless argues that adoption of the\ntransfer-of-risk test would lead to absurd results in which a\nfactoring agent remains liable to growers even though the\nfactoring agent’s payments to a distributor were sufficient,\nin theory, for the distributor to pay growers. AgriCap is\nwrong to describe such a scenario as absurd. It is instead the\nresult of a congressional policy choice. There is an analogy\nin the relationship between general contractors,\nsubcontractors, and property owners in the context of\n\f28     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nmechanics’ liens. It is well established that a property owner\nwho makes final payment to a general contractor without\nfirst securing a release of subcontractors’ mechanics’ liens\nholds the property subject to those liens with exposure to the\nsubcontractors’ claims despite substantial payments to the\ngeneral contractor. See, e.g., Jackson v. Flohr, 227 F.2d 607,\n611 (9th Cir. 1955) (“Mechanics’ liens are provided by\nstatute in order to give the furnisher of labor and material,\nsecurity against the realty so that it is unnecessary to rely\nupon the personal responsibility of the contractor.” ); Brewer\nCorp. v. Point Ctr. Fin., Inc., 223 Cal. App. 4th 831, 839\n(2014), as modified on denial of reh’g (Feb. 27, 2014) (“A\nmechanic’s lien is a claim against real property, which may\nbe filed if a claimant has provided labor or furnished\nmaterials for the property and has not been paid.”); Gary C.\nTanko Well Drilling, Inc. v. Dodds, 117 Cal. App. 3d 588,\n593 (Ct. App. 1981) (explaining that a mechanic’s lien is the\nremedy provided by the California Constitution for\nenforcing against the owner of property payment of the debt\nincurred for the performance of labor, or the furnishing of\nmaterial used in construction). Unpaid subcontractors will\nhave interests that prevail over the property owner (who may\nseek recourse against the general contractor, but who still\nface direct liability to the subcontractors on their liens).\nState legislative action places the interests of subcontractors\nahead of those of property owners. Property owners must\nmanage this risk by diligently ensuring that subcontractors’\nliens are released before giving full payment to a general\ncontractor.\n\n    Similarly, by placing the burden of due diligence on\nlenders rather than growers, Congress was well aware of the\neffect it was imposing on the lending industry. As Judge\nMelloy previously observed, “Congress concluded,\nhowever, that lenders could adapt. The House Committee\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL             29\n\nexpressly noted that anticipated improvements to commerce\nwould offset the lenders’ anticipated burdens.” S & H\nPacking & Sales Co., 850 F.3d at 458; see also H.R. Rep.\nNo. 98-543 at *4 (“[T]he statutory trust requirements will\nnot be a burden to lending institutions. They will be known\nto and considered by prospective lenders in extending credit.\nThe assurance the trust provision gives that raw products\nwill be paid for promptly and that there is a monitoring\nsystem provided for under [PACA] will protect the interests\nof the borrower, the money lender, and the fruit and\nvegetable industry.”).\n\n    The propriety of comparing the PACA situation to\nmechanics’ liens finds support in an examination of the\nregulations promulgated under PACA. Again, the reasoning\nin Judge Melloy’s concurrence is helpful: “These regulations\ndo not ask whether a factoring arrangement in fact resulted\nin a transfer of funds sufficient to pay growers throughout\nthe course of performance under a factoring agreement.\nRather, the regulations ask whether such an arrangement\ncould impair trust assets. See 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(a)(2). Just\nas a property owner must conduct due diligence to avoid\nliability to a subcontractor before making final payment to a\ngeneral contractor, a factoring agent with knowledge of\nPACA must act with diligence. It does not matter that a\nfactoring agent paid a distributor sufficient funds to pay\ngrowers any more than it matters that a property owner paid\na general contractor sufficient funds to pay subcontractors.\nIn light of these statutory and common law protections, it\ncannot properly be the case that a distributor and factoring\nagent may defeat trust beneficiaries’ rights merely by\ninvoking the labels ‘sale’ or ‘factoring agreement.’” S & H\nPacking & Sales Co., 850 F.3d at 458.\n\f30      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    Further, there would seem to be no doubt that a\nlegislature has the power to define and limit liens. See Mercy\nHosp. & Med. Ctr. v. Farmers Ins. Grp. of Companies,\n932 P.2d 210, 215 (Cal. 1997) (“Whatever principles might\ngenerally apply to liens, former section 3045.4 is a statutory,\nnot a common law, lien. The Legislature is, of course, free\nto define and limit such a lien, and has done so in this case.”).\nAs recognized under California law, when there are\ncompeting liens, “the text of the statute prevails if it\nestablishes the priority to be accorded to the statutory lien.”\nCounty of San Bernardino v. Calderon, 148 Cal. App. 4th\n1103, 1112 (2007). The Calderon court concluded that the\nCalifornia’s statutory hospital lien did not have priority over\nother liens by right, stating, “other liens may take priority”.\nId. at 1113 (citing Cal. Civ. Code § 3045.4). The court\nreasoned that the California legislature knew how to create\nexpress priority as evidenced by its treatment of a county’s\nright to action against a third party for reimbursement, where\nthe statute states that the county has a “first lien”. Id. (citing\nGov. Code § 23004.1). Other examples of states creating\npriority interests over secured creditors are seen in Iowa’s\nagricultural supply dealer lien statute and Wisconsin’s tow\ntruck statutory lien. In Iowa, agricultural supply dealers\nhave a “super priority” interest above bank lenders in the\nlivestock of the farmers. In re Schley, 565 B.R. 655, 658\n(Bankr. N.D. Iowa 2017) (“An agricultural supply dealer\nwho provides an agricultural supply to a farmer shall have\nan agricultural lien as provided in section 554.9102.”); see\nIowa Code § 570A.5. In Wisconsin, a person who has the\nlicense to perform towing services and does so has a priority\ninterest, up to a statutory amount, over a bank’s lien and has\na right to retain possession of the vehicle until its costs are\nsatisfied. See In re Ingram, 508 B.R. 98, 102 (Bankr. E.D.\nWis. 2014); Wis. Stat. § 779.415(1g)(a). Indeed, whenever\nwe deal with competing liens, whether established by\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               31\n\nlegislations or common law, we deal not with the question\nof whether a party has a valid debt obligation that is secured\nand should be paid, but rather with the question of which\nclaimant to funds has priority.\n\n    Similarly here, Congress has made a clear policy choice\ngiving PACA creditors priority over secured creditors. We\nmust keep PACA’s purpose in mind when reviewing\ntransactions that may in substance limit that congressional\npolicy.\n\n                              C\n\n    The dissent is not incorrect in asserting that the\ndistinction between a sale and a secured lending agreement\ndoes not ordinarily make a difference under general trust\nprinciples, so long as the transaction at issue is commercially\nreasonable. But we respectfully and forcefully disagree that\nthis is true in the context of a PACA trust. See Boulder Fruit,\n251 F.3d at 1271 (“[G]eneral trust principles [apply] to\nquestions involving the PACA trust, unless those principles\ndirectly conflict with PACA.”).\n\n    PACA was enacted to protect trust beneficiaries, who\nwere often in the position of unsecured creditors, from\nreceiving little or nothing when a distributor went bankrupt.\nSee 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(1). The dissent is not completely\nblind to the policy motivation behind PACA of protecting\ngrowers over lenders, but we think the dissent gives too little\nweight to the protective purpose of PACA. The dissent\nstrives to add protection for the benefit of lenders, but loses\nsight of the PACA statutory language establishing the PACA\ntrust, and disregards the purpose of PACA to protect\nagricultural growers.\n\f32      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    To accomplish its protective purpose, PACA\nsubordinates all secured creditor rights to the rights of the\nunpaid growers and charges the PACA trustee to preserve\nthe rights of trust beneficiaries by making sure that PACA\ntrust assets—the accounts receivable—are not dissipated.\nSee id. at § 499e(c)(2); 7 C.F.R. 46.46(d)(1) (“[Trustees] are\nrequired to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets\nare freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to\nsellers of perishable agricultural commodities. Any act or\nomission which is inconsistent with this responsibility,\nincluding dissipation of trust assets, is unlawful and in\nviolation of section 2 of the Act.”). When there is a sale of\nassets—as relevant here, accounts receivable—there is a\nconversion of the assets from one form, accounts receivable,\nto another, cash. See Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271. The\naccounts receivable are no longer in the trust, and therefore,\nthere cannot be a dissipation of trust assets from the buyer’s\nlater collection on those receivables.\n\n    When there is a secured lending agreement or loan,\nhowever, the accounts receivable remain trust assets and are\nonly collateral to the lender. See Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d\nat 603. In that context, the trustee under PACA is obligated\nnot to dissipate those trust assets. See id. at 604. As the court\nin Nickey Gregory correctly concluded, in those\ncircumstances, there is a breach of trust whenever the lender\nrecovers its fee or percentage from the accounts receivable\nwhile the trust beneficiaries have not been fully\ncompensated. 597 F.3d at 604; see 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(a)(2)\n(precluding the trustee from participating in “any act or\nfailure to act which could result in the diversion of trust\nassets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of\nunpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents to recover money owed\nin connection with produce transactions”). This does not\nmean that every loan or lending agreement made to a\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                           33\n\ndistributor acts to breach a PACA trust, but it does mean that\nwhenever a loan is made, a PACA trustee must be careful to\nensure all trust beneficiaries are paid before the lender\ncollects. If a trustee gives a lender a security interest in\nPACA trust assets, and the growers are not fully repaid, that\nwould be a breach of the PACA trust and a violation of\nPACA.\n\n    Here, whether the transaction at issue was a sale or a loan\nmakes a difference because a sale removes the accounts\nreceivable from the PACA trust while the enforcement of a\nloan in this case would have breached the PACA trust\nbecause AgriCap received its full payment while GW Palmer\nremained unpaid. Therefore, the district court must\ndetermine whether the transaction was in substance a sale or\na loan. 11\n\n\n    11\n        The dissent seeks to give financial institutions the edge in this case\nover agricultural growers.         But the analysis of the dissent is\nfundamentally flawed because it elevates the interests of financial\ninstitutions, the factoring organization AgriCap, over the interests of\nagricultural growers who PACA aimed to protect. As examples:\n\n    •    First, the dissent says that “[t]he majority posits that the growers\n         have a priority lien on their produce, which allows the trust to\n         accept the benefit of a loan agreement but disregard the\n         obligation to repay it.” Dissent at 37. But nowhere do we\n         suggest that trusts are free to disregard their obligations to\n         lenders. A trustee cannot, however, enforce an obligation to a\n         lender above its statutory obligation to trust beneficiaries to not\n         dissipate trust assets.\n\n    •    Second, the dissent suggests that if “the trustee still owed\n         AgriCap money on the loan, then AgriCap would be entitled to\n         foreclose its security interest on the accounts receivable\n         according to the terms of the loan agreement.” Dissent at 53\n         n.15. This argument exceeds what even the Appellee AgriCap\n\f34       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n\n\n\n         understands PACA to allow. AgriCap’s counsel admitted\n         during oral argument, that if it was a true lending agreement,\n         any interest that it had in the accounts receivable as a creditor\n         would be subordinate to the growers.

Dissent at 60–61 n.21. That\n         is incorrect. We have stated what we believe to be the proper\n         test for the district court to employ in the first instance, realizing\n         the limits of our ability to review issues like damages when\n         there is no prior development of the record on appeal on those\n         and related issues. Our court should not participate in the\n         dissent’s interested speculation and conjecture on issues not\n         before us.\n\n     •   Fourth, the dissent offers no judicial authority supporting its\n         view that under PACA a commercially reasonable lending\n         agreement can displace the trust beneficiary rights of the\n         agricultural growers. Further, while challenging the strength of\n         the various circuit precedents that we contend are aligned with\n         our decision, the dissent unmistakably concedes that its position\n         would squarely conflict with the decision of the Fourth Circuit\n         in Nickey Gregory. Dissent at 54–55. The dissent makes this\n         concession arguing more or less that it thinks Nickey Gregory\n         is “critically flawed.” Dissent at 52. However, given the\n         language and purposes of PACA, we see no reason why we\n         should engineer a conflict with the Fourth Circuit’s decision in\n         Nickey Gregory. See Kelton Arms Condo. Owners Ass’n, Inc.\n         v. Homestead Ins. Co., 346 F.3d 1190, 1192 (9th Cir. 2003)\n         (“[W]e decline to create a circuit split unless there is a\n         compelling reason to do so” particularly when “rules are best\n         applied uniformly.”); CTIA-The Wireless Ass’n v.

The\ngrowers in this Circuit will have effectively lost that\nprotection if lenders gain protection by labeling what are in\nsubstance security agreements as if they were factoring\nagreements. The Congressional focus upon the relative\nrights of these two groups, growers and lenders, is evident.\nFor this reason, before a court assesses the commercial\nreasonableness of a factoring agreement, it should first\nexamine the substance of a factoring agreement to ensure\nthat a true sale of the accounts receivable has occurred.\nAbsent a true sale, the labels surrounding a factoring\nagreement should be of little or no consequence. The\nsubstance of the transaction controls. If the substance of a\ntransaction reveals a secured lending arrangement rather\nthan a true sale, the accounts receivable remain trust assets.\nIn that case, unpaid trust beneficiaries will hold an interest\nin accounts receivable and their proceeds superior to all\nunsecured and secured creditors such that the trust\nbeneficiaries should prevail. 12\n\n    The dominant consideration here is that the Congress of\nthe United States in its language in the PACA statute and in\nthe policy considerations underlying PACA has made a clear\nchoice that the rights of agricultural growers are to be given\npriority over the rights of secured lenders through the vehicle\nof the PACA trust. If Tanimura made a true sale of its\nreceivables to AgriCap, acting as a factor, and if it was for\nfair value and a commercially reasonable amount, then the\n\n    12\n       We note that the calculation of damages, if applicable, is left to\nthe district court to review in the first instance after determining the\nsubstance of the accounts receivable transactions.\n\f36        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nPACA trust was not offended. But on the other hand, if the\nchallenged transaction was not a true sale but rather a\nsecured lending arrangement, then the plaintiff Growers\nhave a claim that must be resolved in further proceedings.\nWhat makes this case difficult is that the challenged\ntransaction has some features both of a sale and of a loan.\nOn remand the district court may use all the tools at its\ndisposal, consistent with what we have said in this opinion,\nincluding the taking of testimony and making findings of\nfact, to determine whether the agreement was in substance a\ntrue sale or in substance a lending agreement, and thereafter\nto proceed in a way consistent with this opinion.\n\n    We hold that before considering the commercial\nreasonableness of a transaction, a court must first apply a\nthreshold true sale test for which the transfer-of-risk is a\nprimary factor. 13 To the extent that our en banc opinion\ntoday contradicts Boulder Fruit, we overrule Boulder Fruit.\n\n    We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n     Each party shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       There remain other questions about when the transactions are\nreviewed and whether to apply the test asset-by-asset or taken together.\nWe leave to the district court’s discretion to determine the appropriate\nprocedure for conducting this analysis as the district court is in a better\nposition to do so after briefing from the parties on these issues.\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                37\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge, with whom HURWITZ and\nFRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:\n\n    Congress enacted the Perishable Agricultural\nCommodities Act (PACA) trust, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c), to solve\na simple problem. Most produce growers sell their products\nto distributors on credit. If the distributor goes bankrupt, the\ngrowers are mere unsecured creditors and may only get cents\non the dollar. The distributor’s secured creditors, by\ncontrast, get first crack at the distributor’s assets. To address\nthis problem, PACA made the distributor a trustee, the\ngrowers beneficiaries, and the growers’ produce (and any\nresulting proceeds) trust assets. Congress thus ensured that\nin bankruptcy, the proceeds from the sale of the growers’\nproduce would be available to pay off the growers.\n\n    The appeal before us today poses a related scenario: If a\nPACA trustee borrows money from a lender (using the trust\nassets as collateral) in order to pay the growers, but the\nmoney runs out before all the growers are paid, does the\nlender have an obligation to make the unpaid growers\nwhole? The majority says yes: if the trustee fails to\nreimburse the growers, the lender is on the hook. The\nmajority posits that the growers have a priority lien on their\nproduce, which allows the trust to accept the benefit of a loan\nagreement but disregard the obligation to repay it. Because\nthis surprising conclusion is unmoored from both the text of\nPACA and settled principles of trust law, I dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n    Congress initially enacted PACA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 499a–\n499t, in 1930 to protect growers who marketed and sold their\nproduce through intermediaries. PACA did not originally\nmake growers beneficiaries of a trust. Rather, it required all\nintermediary distributors—commission merchants, dealers,\n\f38     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nand brokers—to operate under licenses issued by the\nSecretary of Agriculture. 7 U.S.C. §§ 499c, 499d (1930).\nPACA also prohibited these distributors from engaging in a\nnumber of unfair business practices, such as failing to make\nprompt and full payment to growers. Id. §§ 499b, 499e.\n\n    Over time, it became evident that PACA gave growers\ninsufficient protection when distributors went bankrupt.\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 3 (1983), as reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 407. As the House Committee explained\nin its report on the proposed 1984 Amendments, sales of\nperishable goods “must be made quickly or they are not\nmade at all.” Id. As a result, produce growers are usually\ncompelled to sell their goods on credit, even though it is\n“often difficult to make credit checks, conditional sales\nagreements, and tak[e] other traditional safeguards.” Id.\n\n    This led to especially harsh consequences when\ndistributors went bankrupt. Distributors typically operate\n“on bank loans secured by the inventories, proceeds or\nassigned receivables from sales of perishable agricultural\ncommodities.” Id. Before Congress intervened, a distributor\ncould give the lender a security interest in all its assets,\nincluding the produce it had purchased from growers on\ncredit and accounts receivable it received from the sale of\nthe produce to retailers. If the distributor went bankrupt, the\nlender would have a secured claim in everything the\ndistributor owned. In contrast, the growers would be\n“unsecured creditors and receive little protection in any suit\nfor recovery of damages where a buyer has failed to make\npayment as required by the contract.” Id. The unsecured\ngrowers would often receive only cents on the dollar on the\ndistributor’s unsecured IOUs. See A Bill to Amend the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930: Hearing on\nS. 2052 Before the Subcomm. on Agric. Prod., Mktg. &\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V.

Comm. on Agric., Nutrition\n& Forestry, 98th Cong. 14 (1983) (statement of Keith Eckel,\nPresident, Pennsylvania Farmers’ Association, on behalf of\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation). A bankruptcy court\ncould even recapture payments the distributor had made to a\ngrower within 90 days of a bankruptcy and use them to pay\nother creditors. Id.; see also 11 U.S.C. § 547.\n\n    In light of this concern, Congress added a trust\nmechanism to PACA in 1984. H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 4.\nThe 1984 Amendments’ operative trust provision, 7 U.S.C.\n§ 499e(c)(2), requires a distributor to hold “perishable\nagricultural commodities, and any receivables or proceeds\nfrom the sale of such commodities or products . . . in trust\nfor the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers” until the\ndistributor makes full payment to its growers. 1 This means\nthat the distributor is a trustee, the growers’ produce (and all\nproceeds from sales of the produce) are the trust res, and the\ngrowers are beneficiaries.\n\n                                   A\n\n    We “apply general trust principles to questions involving\nthe PACA trust, unless those principles directly conflict with\n    1\n       The 1984 Amendments also created a procedure for enforcing trust\nrights. Section 499e(c)(3) provided that a beneficiary must preserve its\nright to benefits by issuing written notice to the trustee within 30 days\nafter the trustee’s failure to make payment. 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(3).\nSection 499e(c)(4) allowed a beneficiary to alternatively preserve its\nrights through standardized language on billing or invoice statements.\nSection 499e(c)(5) vested jurisdiction in federal district courts to hear\n“(i) actions by trust beneficiaries to enforce payment from the trust, and\n(ii) actions by the Secretary to prevent and restrain dissipation of the\ntrust.” The plaintiffs in this case included the standardized language on\ntheir invoices to Tanimura Distributing, Inc. (TDI).\n\f40       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nPACA.” Boulder Fruit Express & Heger Organic Farm\nSales v. Transp.

CIT\nGrp./Factoring, Inc., 67 F.3d 1063, 1067 (2d Cir. 1995).\nLike other circuits, we have turned to the Restatement of\nTrusts for those principles. 2 See, e.g., Nickey Gregory Co.\nv. AgriCap, LLC, 597 F.3d 591, 605–06 (4th Cir. 2010);\nReaves Brokerage Co. v. Sunbelt Fruit & Vegetable Co.,\n336 F.3d 410, 413–14 & nn.17–18 (5th Cir. 2003); Boulder\nFruit, 251 F.3d at 1271–72; Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at\n1067–68; Consumers Produce Co. v.

Bank, N.A., 952 F.2d 1311, 1313–\n14 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n    Two key principles of trust law are crucial to\nunderstanding the trust mechanism in PACA. First, by\nmaking the distributor a trustee and the growers’ produce\nand the proceeds trust assets, Congress transformed how\nthese assets are treated in bankruptcy. A PACA trustee-\ndistributor wears two hats in a bankruptcy proceeding. All\nof the debtor’s own assets are subject to the claims of its\ncreditors. But the trust assets do not belong to the debtor;\nthe distributor as trustee holds only a nonbeneficial, bare\nlegal title to such assets. Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 42\n\n     2\n        The current trend is to rely on both the Second and Third\nRestatements of Trusts. See, e.g., United States v. Jicarilla Apache\nNation, 564 U.S. 162, 177–78, 183–84 (2011) (relying on both the\nSecond and Third Restatement); Skinner v. Northrop Grumman Ret.\nPlan B, 673 F.3d 1162, 1166–67 (9th Cir. 2012) (same); Lonely Maiden\nProds., LLC v. GoldenTree Asset Mgmt., LP, 201 Cal. App. 4th 368, 379\n(2011) (“California trust law is essentially derived from the Restatement\nSecond of Trusts. Over a number of years, the Restatement Second of\nTrusts has been superseded by the Restatement Third of Trusts. As a\nresult, we may look to the Restatement Third of Trusts for guidance.”).\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                      41\n\n(Am. Law Inst. 2003). Therefore, the trust assets are not part\nof the debtor’s bankruptcy estate. See 11 U.S.C. § 541(b),\n(d); United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S. 198, 205\nn.10 (1983) (“Congress plainly excluded property of others\nheld by the debtor in trust at the time of the filing of the\npetition” from the bankruptcy estate.); Sunkist Growers, Inc.\nv. Fisher, 104 F.3d 280, 282 (9th Cir. 1997); Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts § 42 cmt. c (“[T]he trustee’s personal\ncreditors or trustee in bankruptcy may not reach either the\ntrust property or the trustee’s nonbeneficial interest\ntherein.”).\n\n    Second, by making the distributor a trustee of the PACA\ntrust, Congress authorized the distributor to manage the\nproduce and any resulting assets for the growers’ benefit,\nsubject to the standards that govern trustees. 3 Under basic\ntrust principles, a trustee has the same powers over trust\nproperty as any other owner of property, “except as limited\nby statute or the terms of the trust,” id. § 85; accord Unif.\nTrust Code § 815 (Unif. Law Comm’n 2000). This includes\nthe authority “to sell trust property . . . in exchange for other\nproperty,” Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 86 cmt. c, and the\n“power to borrow money for trust purposes and to pledge,\nmortgage, grant a deed of trust, or otherwise encumber trust\nproperty,” id. § 86 cmt. d. Any money obtained from such\ntransactions becomes an asset of the trust estate. Third-party\nlenders or purchasers dealing with a trustee generally hold\nthe assets or security interest free of the trust. See\n\n    3\n      Because the PACA trust is a “nonsegregated ‘floating’ trust,” it\npermits “[c]ommingling of trust assets.” 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(b); H.R. Rep.\nNo. 98-543, at 4. Commingling relieves trustees of the burden “to\nspecifically identify all of the trust assets through each step” of\nadministering the trust. H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 5.\n\f42          G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nRestatement (Second) of Trusts § 283 (Am. Law. Inst.\n1959). 4 The buyer or lender has no duty to “ensure that\nassets transferred to the trustee are properly applied to trust\npurposes.” Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 108(3)(b). Even\nwhen the trustee breaches its fiduciary duty, someone who\n“takes for value and without notice of the breach of trust,” is\na “bona fide” transferee, “holds the interest so transferred or\ncreated free of the trust, and is under no liability to the\nbeneficiary.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 284. 5\n\n    There is an important exception to this rule. If (1) the\ntrustee breaches its fiduciary duties when selling a trust asset\nor granting a security interest in a trust asset, and (2) the third\nparty is on notice of this breach, the third party does not take\nthe asset or security interest free of the trust. Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts § 288. Rather, the third party takes the\nasset in “a constructive trust for the beneficiary of the trust,”\nid. § 288 cmt. a., and may be compelled to restore the asset\n\n     4\n         Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 283 states:\n\n            If the trustee transfers trust property to a third person\n            or creates a legal or equitable interest in the subject\n            matter of the trust in a third person, and the trustee in\n            making the transfer or in creating the interest does not\n            commit a breach of trust, the third person holds the\n            interest so transferred or created free of the trust, and\n            is under no liability to the beneficiary.\n\n     5\n       Although the Second Restatement uses the term “bona fide\npurchaser,” the term also applies when the trustee “creates a legal\ninterest” in trust property, § 284(1), such as by giving “a legal mortgage\nor pledge or legal lien upon the trust property,” id. § 284 cmt. g. In other\nwords, a lender’s security interest may be protected by the bona fide\npurchaser defense, even if the trustee breached its fiduciary duty by\ngranting the interest.\n\f         G.W.

AGRICAP FINANCIAL                           43\n\nor any proceeds derived from it, id. § 291(1). 6 A trustee may\nbreach its fiduciary duties by failing to “exercise caution . . .\ncare and skill in deciding whether and under what terms to\nborrow money for trust purposes or to grant a security\ninterest in trust property,” Restatement (Third) of Trusts\n§ 86 cmt. d, or by acting in a similarly careless manner when\nselling trust property, id. § 86 cmts. b, c. Therefore, a trustee\nbreaches its fiduciary duty if it enters into an agreement with\na third party that is not commercially reasonable. See\nBoulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271–72. 7\n\n\n\n    6\n       Equity recognizes some exceptions to this rule. A third party that\nhas conferred a benefit on the trust estate may be entitled to\nreimbursement from trust assets. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of\nTrusts § 291 cmt. o (“If the trustee in breach of trust transfers trust\nproperty to a person who takes with notice of the breach of trust and who\npays value for the trust property, and the beneficiary compels him to\nrestore the property to the trust or to account for its value or for the\nproceeds, the transferee is entitled to credit for the amount which he paid\nfor the trust property to the extent to which the trust estate has the benefit\nthereof.”); id. § 269 (“A person who has conferred a benefit on the trust\nestate and cannot obtain satisfaction of his claim out of the trustee's\nindividual property can by a proceeding in equity reach trust property\nand apply it to the satisfaction of his claim to the extent to which the trust\nestate has been benefited, unless under the circumstances it is inequitable\nto allow him such remedy.”); see also Thomas v. Provident Life & Tr.\nCo., 138 F. 348, 349 (9th Cir. 1905) (holding that even if the trustee\ngranted a lender a mortgage on trust property in breach of the trust, the\ntrust estate “having received the benefit of the money, ought, in equity,\nto repay it, with interest.”).\n\n     7\n       The breaching trustee is also liable to the beneficiaries. “[I]f the\ntrustee wrongfully uses trust money in his own business, or if he lends\ntrust money to himself, the beneficiary can impose a constructive trust\nor equitable lien upon the proceeds if he can trace them.” Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts § 202 cmt. e.\n\f44       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    Nothing in PACA alters these basic trust principles. A\nPACA trustee, like any other trustee, has authority to sell\ntrust assets or borrow money secured by an interest in trust\nproperty. See Preamble to Regulations Under the Perishable\nAgricultural Commodities Act, 49 Fed. Reg. 45,735, 45,738\n(Nov. 20, 1984) (codified at 7 C.F.R. pt. 46) (stating that “the\nregulations do not prohibit a buyer or receiver from granting\na secured interest in trust assets”); see also Nickey Gregory,\n597 F.3d at 600 (holding that PACA permits the PACA\ntrustee to transfer accounts receivable to a lender “as\ncollateral for a secured loan”). And like any trustee, a\nPACA trustee is liable if it breaches its fiduciary duty. The\nDepartment’s regulations require the distributor-trustee to\nmaintain trust assets “to satisfy outstanding obligations to\nsellers of perishable agricultural commodities” and prohibit\n“[a]ny act or omission which is inconsistent with this\nresponsibility, including dissipation of trust assets.”\n7 C.F.R. § 46.46(d)(1). 8\n\n                                   B\n\n    The facts in this case must be understood in light of these\nprinciples. Tanimura Distributing, Inc. (TDI) was in the\nbusiness of distributing produce. TDI bought produce on\ncredit from numerous growers, including the plaintiffs in this\naction (collectively, “Palmer”). TDI then resold this produce\nto retail outlets, usually on credit. Under a Factoring\nAgreement, TDI gave Agricap Financial Corp. an interest in\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       Dissipation is defined as “any act or failure to act which could\nresult in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or impair\nthe ability of unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents to recover money owed\nin connection with produce transactions.” 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(a)(2).\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                       45\n\nthe retailers’ IOUs (i.e., TDI’s accounts receivable) in\nexchange for the cash TDI needed to pay its growers.\n\n    These relationships are easier to understand by using a\nhypothetical example. Let’s say Palmer sells four bushels of\ntomatoes to TDI for $100 on credit. Per PACA, TDI holds\nthe bushels in trust. See 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2). TDI (as\ntrustee) then sells the four bushels to Safeway for $200, and\ntakes back an IOU, which is an asset of the trust. Under the\nFactoring Agreement, TDI assigns the $200 Safeway IOU to\nAgriCap as the “absolute owner.” In exchange, AgriCap\npromptly pays TDI 80 percent of the face value of the $200\naccount receivable, $160. This $160 becomes an asset of the\ntrust, held by TDI for the benefit of Palmer and other\ngrowers who sell to TDI on credit. After AgriCap collects\nthe $200 from Safeway, it pays TDI the remaining\n20 percent of the face value of the account receivable, less a\n3 percent finance fee. 9 This payment becomes part of the\ntrust corpus. Assuming Safeway paid on time, AgriCap\nwould pay $34 to TDI, for a total payment of $194 for the\nbenefit of the trust.\n\n    The Factoring Agreement provided AgriCap some\nprotections in exchange for taking the risk that the\nreceivables would not be collectible. Among other things,\nAgriCap could require TDI to repurchase accounts\nreceivable in certain circumstances, primarily if TDI had\nmade an error in calculating the amount of produce sold to\n\n    9\n       Under the terms of the Agreement, AgriCap’s fees were only\n1.5 percent, meaning that TDI would get 98.5 percent of the face value\nof each account receivable. In practice, AgriCap asserts that it paid TDI\non average 97 percent of the receivable’s value, and Palmer does not\ncontend otherwise. Earlier in this litigation, AgriCap stated that it paid\n98.2 percent on average. The district court did not make a finding on the\nactual amount paid, but estimated that it was “likely in the 90% range.”\n\f46     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nSafeway, and the Agreement required TDI to take back\naccounts receivable that were uncollectible after 90 days.\nHowever, AgriCap assumed the risk of loss in the event that\nSafeway became insolvent.\n\n     In sum, TDI received an 80 percent advance on the value\nof its accounts receivable and would receive up to 97 percent\nof their face value. Because PACA creates a nonsegregated\nfloating trust, TDI was statutorily authorized to use the\nmoney it received from AgriCap to pay all the growers,\nincluding Palmer, and with the 80 percent advance on each\naccount receivable, was able to do so with increased speed.\n\n    Although the Factoring Agreement states that TDI sold\nthe accounts receivable to AgriCap, it is possible, as the\nmajority suggests, to characterize the transaction as a loan.\nMaj. Op. at 12. If the arrangement is viewed as a loan, TDI,\nacting as a trustee, has borrowed $160 from AgriCap for the\nbenefit of all the growers (the beneficiaries), and assigned\nthe $200 Safeway account receivable to AgriCap as security\nfor the loan. A lender taking only a security interest in an\naccount receivable would typically not have any ability to\ncollect the account receivable (unless the borrower\ndefaulted). But the Factoring Agreement provides that once\nthe $200 account receivable is assigned to AgriCap, it is the\nsole entity authorized to collect it. Therefore, to maintain\nthe recharacterization of this transaction as a loan, we must\nview TDI as authorizing AgriCap to act as its collection\nagency, in addition to AgriCap’s role as secured lender. See\nNickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 603 (explaining, in the context\nof a similar agreement, that if the third party was “not a\npurchaser of the accounts receivable,” then it was “a lender\nand collection agent”). As TDI’s agent, AgriCap collects the\n$200 that Safeway owed TDI. Those funds are used to pay\nback the $160 loan to AgriCap, plus a $6 finance fee, leaving\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                    47\n\nan additional $34 for the benefit of the growers (thus\nobtaining a grand total of $194 cash from the sale of the four\nbushels of tomatoes to Safeway).\n\n    This relationship—however characterized—broke down\nin August 2008, when TDI failed to pay Palmer amounts\nowed for its produce. After Palmer sued TDI, the distributor\nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. In re Tanimura\nDistrib., Inc., No. 2:08-bk-22644-TD (Bankr. C.D. Cal.\nAug. 13, 2008), ECF No. 1.\n\n    When it declared bankruptcy, TDI owed Palmer roughly\n$845,000. 10 Absent PACA, Palmer would have been an\nunsecured creditor. Instead, the assets of the PACA trust\nwere available for distribution to Palmer, and TDI’s secured\ncreditors could not touch them. The administrator of TDI’s\nbankruptcy estate thus went about “identifying, recovering,\nand liquidating the PACA trust assets of [TDI] and\npreserving those funds for the benefit of all PACA trust\ncreditors.” Stipulation for Order Establishing PACA Trust\nClaims Procedure and Surcharge for Administrative\nExpenses at 11, In re Tanimura Distrib., Inc., No. 2:08-bk-\n22644-TD, (Bankr. C.D. Cal. Jan. 26, 2009), ECF No. 60\n(approved by bankruptcy court, ECF No. 67). 11\n\n    After TDI’s bankruptcy filing, Palmer added AgriCap to\nits complaint in this case, alleging that TDI’s accounts\nreceivable were PACA trust assets and AgriCap should\n\n    10\n      In its initial complaint, Palmer sought to recover approximately\n$882,000 in unpaid debts from produce sales, but now seeks only\n$845,000.\n    11\n       TDI’s bankruptcy estate has now been fully distributed. See\nChapter 7 Trustee’s Final Account, In re Tanimura Distrib., Inc., No.\n2:08-bk-22644-TD, (Bankr. C.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2014), ECF No. 262.\n\f48     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nreturn them to Palmer. In its motion for summary judgment,\nPalmer argued that TDI breached its fiduciary duty by\ngranting AgriCap a security interest in accounts receivable\nfrom the sale of Palmer’s produce and by transferring those\naccounts receivable to AgriCap. Further, Palmer claimed,\nAgriCap knew TDI was in breach of trust and is therefore\nliable to Palmer for the value of the accounts receivable that\nTDI transferred to AgriCap. In effect, Palmer’s summary\njudgment motion claims that because TDI did not pay\nPalmer the $160 it initially borrowed from AgriCap,\nAgriCap has to make good on TDI’s obligation.\n\n                              II\n\n    Under trust law, AgriCap’s potential liability primarily\nturns on whether the TDI breached its fiduciary duty. As\nexplained above, if TDI breached its fiduciary duty to\nPalmer and the growers by entering into the Factoring\nAgreement or by performing its obligations under the\nFactoring Agreement, and AgriCap was on notice of the\nbreach, AgriCap would hold any security interest in the trust\nassets or any proceeds derived from those assets, in a\nconstructive trust for the benefit of the growers.\n\n    Because a PACA trustee can give a lender a security\ninterest in trust assets, TDI did not breach its fiduciary duty\nto the growers merely by entering into the Factoring\nAgreement. The parties do not argue that the Factoring\nAgreement is commercially unreasonable; indeed, there\nwould be no basis for doing so. In our example, TDI as\ntrustee would get $194, or 97 percent of the $200 account\nreceivable. This far exceeds the 80 percent return that we\nhave approved in the sale of assets. See Boulder Fruit,\n251 F.3d at 1272 (“[A] factoring discount of 20% was never\nshown to be commercially unreasonable”). And, in the loan\nscenario, AgriCap is merely acting as a collection agent, and\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                  49\n\nit would not be commercially unreasonable for a creditor to\nagree that its collection agent can return accounts receivable\nthat are uncollectible. Moreover, if TDI takes back the $200\nuncollectible account receivable, TDI is no worse off than it\nwas before it authorized AgriCap to collect the account\nreceivable; TDI retains the asset, which has the same value\nbefore and after its transaction with AgriCap. After entering\ninto the Factoring Agreement, TDI as trustee was bound by\nits terms (assuming AgriCap did not breach the agreement).\nIf entering into the Factoring Agreement did not breach\nTDI’s fiduciary duties, then neither did complying with its\nterms. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 88 cmt. b\n(explaining that “if a trustee borrows funds from a third party\nfor use in the administration of the trust, the interest on the\nloan is payable (or reimbursable) from the trust estate,” so\nlong as the terms are “reasonable and the borrowing serves\nan appropriate trust purpose and is otherwise consistent with\nthe trustee’s fiduciary duties”); Austin W. Scott et. al., Scott\nand Ascher on Trusts § 26.2 (5th ed. 2007) (noting that the\ntrust estate remains liable for performing a contract entered\ninto by the trustee, even when the contract “is not in all\nrespects proper”). Indeed, no party argues that the Factoring\nAgreement is commercially unreasonable because it does\nnot include a term that would allow TDI to delay making\nrequired loan payments until after all growers who provide\nproduce to TDI have been fully paid. 12\n\n   In short, TDI did not breach its fiduciary duties as trustee\nwhen it entered into an agreement under which it received\nan 80 percent advance on each account receivable in\nexchange for repaying the advance plus a fee of 3 percent.\n\n    12\n       As indicated below, infra at p. 54, because PACA is a non-\nsegregated floating trust, such a term would likely prevent TDI from\nevery repaying a lender.\n\f50        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nNor did TDI breach its fiduciary duties by complying with\nthe terms of this agreement, which required TDI to repay the\nmoney borrowed from AgriCap. Therefore, AgriCap holds\nits interest in the accounts receivable and loan payments free\nof the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 283.\nUnder principles applicable to all trusts, including PACA\ntrusts, AgriCap has no liability to Palmer or any other\ngrower.\n\n                                  III\n\n    The majority agrees that basic trust principles apply to\nPACA trusts. Maj. Op. at 15. It also agrees that trust assets\nare excluded from the distributor’s bankruptcy estate if the\ndistributor goes bankrupt. Maj. Op. at 15. It agrees that if a\ntrustee “transfers trust property to a third person . . .\n[without] commit[ting] a breach of trust, the third person\nholds the interest so transferred or created free of the trust,\nand is under no liability to the beneficiary.” Maj. Op. at 16\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 283). Finally, the\nmajority agrees that a trustee can give a lender a security\ninterest in PACA trust assets without violating PACA. Maj.\nOp. at 32–33.\n\n    So how does the majority nonetheless reach the striking\nconclusion that if the Factoring Agreement is deemed to be\na loan transaction, then AgriCap, which paid TDI $194 for a\n$200 trust asset, is liable to Palmer for the same $200? 13 See\nMaj. Op. at 27–28. The majority reasons that under a loan\n\n     13\n        If described as a loan, this means that after TDI borrowed $194\nand subsequently repaid the $194 loan (plus fees) to AgriCap, AgriCap\nmust return the $194 plus fees to TDI, with no prospect of ever getting\nits loan repaid.\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                        51\n\nscenario, even if TDI did not breach its fiduciary duties by\nentering into a loan agreement, it breached them by\ncomplying with the terms of the loan agreement and repaying\nAgriCap’s loan. According to the majority’s analysis,\nbecause TDI repaid AgriCap’s loan before Palmer was paid\n(regardless whether TDI used AgriCap’s loan to pay other\ngrowers), AgriCap must make Palmer whole. 14 Maj. Op. at\n33. As explained below, this conclusion is not based in\nPACA or trust law, is contrary to our precedent, and cannot\nreasonably be applied to these transactions.\n\n    In reaching its conclusion that a trustee would breach its\nfiduciary duty by repaying the loan from trust assets “while\nthe trust beneficiaries have not been fully compensated,”\nMaj. Op. at 32, the majority relies on Nickey Gregory Co. v.\nAgriCap, LLC, which analyzed a similar agreement between\nAgriCap and a PACA trustee. See 597 F.3d at 596, 601–02.\nThe Fourth Circuit reasoned that the trustee’s arrangement\nwith AgriCap “authorized trust assets to be used to repay\nAgriCap ahead of the commodities sellers, who went\nunpaid,” and such an arrangement “breached the PACA\n\n    14\n        More precisely, the majority states that a trustee breaches its\nfiduciary duties “whenever the lender recovers its fee or percentage from\nthe accounts receivable while the trust beneficiaries have not been fully\ncompensated.” Maj. Op. at 32. It is not clear whether the majority deems\nthe breach to be limited to a trustee’s payment of interest to a lender, or\ndeems the trustee’s repayment of principal to the lender to also be a\nbreach of trust. Nor does the majority make clear whether a lender must\nreturn only the interest it received on the loan or must also return the\nrepayment of principal. Nevertheless, the majority’s adoption of this\nanalysis indicates that the majority assumes the lender must return both\ninterest and principal to the trustee. See Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at\n606–07 (rejecting AgriCap’s alternative argument that it should be\nrequired to disgorge only “the amount it received in interest and fees”\nand instead requiring it to disgorge all collections on receivables up to\nthe amount of growers’ claims).\n\f52     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\ntrust,” because the trustee “was obligated to ensure that trust\nassets remained freely available to pay PACA creditors\nfirst.” Id. at 604. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit concluded\nthat “AgriCap, as a third-party transferee of the trust assets,\nmust, under established trust principles, disgorge the\nproceeds of the receivables unless it has a defense.” Id.\n\n    The majority adopts this reasoning. While conceding\nthat this result has no basis in trust principles, Maj. Op. at\n31, the majority contends that this result is required by\nPACA, and quotes the regulation stating that PACA trustees\n“are required to maintain trust assets in a manner that such\nassets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations\nto sellers of perishable agricultural commodities,” and this\nprecludes a trustee from repaying a loan to the trust. Maj.\nOp. at 32 (quoting 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(d)(1)).\n\n     The majority’s analysis, like that in Nickey Gregory, is\ncritically flawed. First, the majority misunderstands the\nnature of trust assets. In the case of a loan, the trustee\nmaintains two assets available for the growers: the $194 that\nthe trustee received from the lender ($160 as an advance, $34\npost-collection), and the accounts receivable subject to the\nlender’s $160 lien. The trustee’s repayment of the $160 to\nthe lender does not dissipate the trust’s assets, because the\ntrust is not entitled to that $160 under the terms of the loan\nagreement. The typical produce sales arrangement seems\nmore questionable under the majority’s reasoning, because\nTDI relinquished the produce (an asset of the estate that is\nno longer freely available to the growers) to Safeway, and\nreceived only a promise to pay in return. Of course,\nCongress did not intend to preclude this sort of arrangement.\n\n    Second, the majority misunderstands the nature of a\ntrustee’s obligation in a loan agreement. Just like any trustee\nwho takes out a loan for the benefit of the beneficiaries and\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                        53\n\nuses trust assets as collateral, the PACA trustee must repay\nthe loan according to the terms of the loan agreement, and\nthe secured lender’s lien on those trust assets remains\nenforceable if the loan is not repaid. 15 Failure to pay the loan\naccording to its terms would constitute a breach of the\ntrustee’s fiduciary duties. See Scott et al., supra, § 17.8 (“A\ntrustee of property subject to a mortgage must take\nreasonable steps to prevent loss of the property by\nforeclosure.”). The majority cites nothing in PACA that\n\n    15\n       At oral argument, AgriCap’s counsel stated that the trust estate\nno longer contains any uncollected accounts receivable subject to a\nsecurity interest, and so such accounts receivable are not at issue in this\nappeal. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court, Oral\nArgument 14-56059 G.W. Palmer & Co. v. AgriCap Fin. Corp.,\nYOUTUBE 28:30–28:50 (Sept. 20, 2017), https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=iikaXV7nkaw.\n\n      But were the issue before us, basic principles of trust law establish\nthat AgriCap would have the same rights with respect to those accounts\nreceivables as it would to the proceeds. If TDI, as trustee, did not breach\nits fiduciary duties when it borrowed money from AgriCap (or AgriCap\ndid not have knowledge of the breach), and the trustee still owed\nAgriCap money on the loan, then AgriCap would be entitled to foreclose\nits security interest on the accounts receivable according to the terms of\nthe loan agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 283–84, 288\n(explaining that a third-party lender holds its security interest in trust\nproperty free of the trust unless the grant of the interest was a breach of\nthe trustee’s fiduciary duty, the lender had notice, and the lender did not\ngive value).\n\n     While AgriCap’s counsel stated in response to questioning that a\nlender’s interest in the accounts receivable would be subordinate to the\ngrowers’ interests as beneficiaries, Maj. Op. at 33 n.11, we do not\nconstrue statutes based on passing statements at oral argument. Roberts\nv. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U.S. 249, 253 (1999) (per curiam) (“[T]he\nconcession of a point on appeal by [a party] is by no means dispositive\nof a legal issue.”). Here, the growers’ interests would be superior only\nto creditors of TDI as a debtor, not to creditors of TDI as trustee.\n\f54      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nallows the trustee to disregard such an obligation, and we\n“do not construe statutes in a manner that would lead to\nabsurd results,” nor “impute to Congress an intent to create\na law that produces an unreasonable result.” United States v.\nCasasola, 670 F.3d 1023, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012).\n\n    Indeed, the majority’s theory of breach—that the trustee\ncannot repay a loan to the trust until all beneficiaries have\nbeen paid—would likely preclude a trustee from borrowing\nmoney secured by trust assets. Because PACA is a non-\nsegregated floating trust, 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(b), each grower\nhas a claim on the trust assets, whether they were acquired\nbefore or after the grower sold its produce to the trustee. See\nIn re Kornblum & Co., Inc., 81 F.3d 280, 286 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(holding that “a single PACA trust exists for the benefit of\nall of the sellers to a Produce Debtor, and continues in\nexistence until all of the outstanding beneficiaries have been\npaid in full.”). So long as the trustee continues to purchase\nproduce from growers on credit, there will be new growers\nwho have not yet been paid and therefore the trustee would\nbe precluded from repaying any lender from the trust assets.\nNo lender would enter into a loan agreement if the law\nprecluded repayment of the loan.\n\n    Perhaps realizing that there is no statutory basis for\nholding that a PACA trustee cannot repay a lender pursuant\nto the terms of the loan agreement, the majority posits that if\na PACA trustee borrows from a lender, and secures the loan\nwith an interest in trust property, the beneficiaries have a\npriority lien on the trust property over all other lenders. Maj.\nOp. at 27–28. The majority analogizes to circumstances\nwhere state law protects a creditor by giving that creditor a\npriority lien over all other creditors. Maj. Op. at 27–31.\n\n    This framework, however, is divorced from the language\nof PACA and basic principles of trust law. Congress could\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                          55\n\nwell have provided that when a distributor purchases a\ngrower’s produce on credit, the grower would be deemed, by\noperation of law, to have a lien on that produce (and its\nproceeds) that has priority over the liens of all other\ncreditors. But, there is nothing to this effect in PACA.\nRather, Congress elected to rely on a trust mechanism, and\nto protect growers by making the distributor a trustee\nholding their proceeds in trust. See 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2).\nA beneficiary of a trust does not have any lien on trust assets,\nlet alone a priority lien. 16\n\n    Although the majority purports to follow the lead of\nthree other circuits, only the Fourth Circuit has adopted the\ntheory that a trustee’s loan repayments in the ordinary course\nof business are a breach of trust. In Reaves Brokerage Co.\nv. Sunbelt Fruit & Vegetable Co., 336 F.3d 410, 413–14\n(5th Cir. 2003), and Endico Potatoes, Inc. v. CIT\nGroup/Factoring, Inc., 67 F.3d 1063, 1067–68 (2d Cir.\n1995), the courts analyzed whether a transaction between a\nPACA trustee and a third party constituted a loan or “true\nsale” in order to determine whether the transferee was a bona\nfide purchaser under section 284 of the Restatement\n\n      16\n         Although the Department of Agriculture stated in the preamble to\nits regulations that a lender that takes a secured interest in a PACA trust\nasset takes “a secured interest [that] is secondary and specifically\nvoidable in order to satisfy debts to unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents in\nperishable agricultural commodity transactions,” Preamble to\nRegulations Under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act,\n49 Fed. Reg. at 45,738, this language is contrary to the language of the\nstatute and the regulations themselves, and so merits no weight, see\nMines v. Sullivan, 981 F.2d 1068, 1070 (9th Cir. 1992) (“A court need\nnot accept an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations if that\ninterpretation is inconsistent with the wording of the regulation or\ninconsistent with the statute under which the regulations were\npromulgated.”).\n\f56        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n(Second) of Trusts. 17 Since section 284 applies only if the\ntrustee breaches its fiduciary duty, see supra p. 42; Boulder\nFruit, 251 F.3d at 1272 (“Whether a transferee of trust assets\nis a bona fide purchaser becomes relevant only as a defense\nafter it has been determined that a breach of trust has\noccurred.”), those courts necessarily presumed that a breach\nhad occurred, but did not explain their theory. 18 None\nsuggested that the trustee’s repayment of a loan according to\nits terms constituted a breach of the trustee’s fiduciary duty.\n\n    Moreover, the Second Circuit has recognized, consistent\nwith Boulder Fruit, “that it is not a breach of trust for a\nPACA dealer to use PACA funds to enter into ‘commercially\nreasonable’ transactions with parties not protected by\nPACA, particularly where such transactions facilitate a\nPACA dealer’s fulfillment of his obligations to PACA\nbeneficiaries.” E. Armata, Inc. v. Korea Commercial Bank\nof N.Y., 367 F.3d 123, 133 (2d Cir. 2004); see also D.M.\nRothman & Co. v. Korea Commercial Bank of N.Y., 411 F.3d\n90, 96 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that a third-party bank was\nnot liable for its receipt of a PACA trustee’s account fees,\ninterest, and any other funds whose “retention was\ncommercially reasonable”).\n\n\n     17\n        As explained above, the bona fide purchaser defense applies\nequally to a lender’s security interest in trust assets or the purchase of\ntrust assets. See supra p. 42 n.5; Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 284\n& cmt. g.\n\n     18\n        The majority also cites A & J Produce Corp. v. Bronx Overall\nEconomic Development Corp., which relied on Reaves and Endico\nPotatoes for the proposition that a lender is not a bona fide purchaser for\nvalue, but likewise failed to identify any breach by the trustee. 542 F.3d\n54, 58–59 (2d Cir. 2008).\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                  57\n\n    Nor does the majority explain how its analytic\nframework applies to the facts in this case. If the Factoring\nAgreement is in fact a loan agreement, then AgriCap loaned\nTDI between $19,057,000 and $20,425,000 for many\ndifferent accounts receivable, and TDI ultimately paid back\n(through AgriCap’s collections on the accounts receivable)\nsome amount up to the loan amount plus a finance fee for\neach of those accounts receivable. 19 Although the majority\nindicates that AgriCap is liable to Palmer for some portion\nof the money AgriCap received in repayment of its $19–20\nmillion in loans, the majority gives no direction to the district\ncourt on how to determine the extent to which AgriCap is\nliable. To the extent the majority’s reasoning would require\nAgriCap to repay principal and interest on its loan, the\nmajority effectively makes the factor the trustee’s guarantor,\nwho must make the beneficiaries whole if the trustee does\nnot do so. But it is already settled that “third parties are not\nguarantors of the PACA trust.” Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at\n1272; Consumers Produce Co. v. Volante Wholesale\nProduce, Inc., 16 F.3d 1374, 1381 (3d Cir. 1994) (“The\nproduce purchaser is the trustee of the trust and creditors are\nnot insurers of unpaid beneficiaries when they receive trust\nassets in breach of trust.”); C.H. Robinson Co. v. Tr. Co.\nBank, N.A., 952 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir. 1992) (“Secured\nlenders are not guarantors of PACA trusts.”).\n\n    At bottom, the majority’s concern appears to be that trust\nprinciples are insufficiently protective of growers here. But\nthe majority offers no principled distinction for why a trustee\ncan sell produce for cash, sell an account receivable for cash,\nbut not borrow cash secured by the produce or account\nreceivable, even though the trustee gets substantially the\n\n   19\n      The parties dispute the amounts AgriCap loaned to TDI and the\namounts that TDI repaid AgriCap.\n\f58     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nsame amount of cash for the benefit of the growers in each\ntransaction. More fundamentally, the majority’s discussion\nof PACA’s purpose seems to conflate lenders-to-the-\ndistributor with lenders-to-the-trustee. Lenders to the\ndistributor cannot reach PACA assets in bankruptcy because\nTDI holds those assets in trust for the growers. See Sunkist\nGrowers, 104 F.3d at 282. But when we deal with secured\nlenders to the trust, the loan advance and subsequent\npayments become trust property, and it is fully consistent\nwith PACA’s purpose to look at whether the trust got a fair\n(i.e., commercially reasonable) deal.\n\n     Once we discard the majority’s theory of breach, its\ndiscussion of the test for a “true sale” becomes irrelevant.\nMaj. Op. at 26–27. In the trust context, the key question is\nnot whether the trustee is engaged in a sale or loan, but\nwhether the trustee breached its fiduciary duty in entering\ninto the loan agreement (and complying with it according to\nits terms). The answer to that question turns primarily on the\ncommercial reasonableness of the individual transaction and\nits terms.\n\n                             IV\n\n    By enacting PACA, Congress provided significant\nprotection to growers by ensuring that a distributor who buys\ntheir produce on credit owes the growers a fiduciary duty to\nmanage the trust assets (the produce and its proceeds) for\ntheir benefit. Contrary to the majority’s assertion, this\nprotection does not entitle growers to disregard obligations\nundertaken by the trustee on their behalf. If the trustee\nborrows money for the benefit of the beneficiaries in a\ncommercially reasonable transaction, the lender is entitled to\nbe paid back from trust assets. Under trust principles and\nPACA, there is an exception to this rule only if the trustee\nbreached its fiduciary duties when it entered into the loan\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               59\n\narrangement, and the lender was on notice of this breach. In\nthis context, there is no need to distinguish between “true\nsales” and “loans.” In other words, we had it right in Boulder\nFruit: we look at the commercial reasonableness of the\nagreement to determine whether it was a breach of trust,\nregardless whether the agreement is a sale or a loan.\nRecourse provisions and other features that “transfer risk”\nmay be relevant to this analysis. But unless the transaction\nis commercially unreasonable or otherwise a breach of the\ntrustee’s fiduciary duty, there is no basis under PACA or\ntrust law for depriving the lender of its right to repayment\nunder the loan agreement or, as in this case, requiring a\nlender that has loaned money to the trust and been repaid by\nthe borrower to return the borrower’s repayment.\n\n      The majority’s approach is inconsistent with PACA, and\nthat should be enough to reject it. “[W]e will not presume\nwith [appellants] that any result consistent with their account\nof the statute's overarching goal must be the law but will\npresume more modestly instead ‘that [the] legislature says\n. . . what it means and means . . . what it says.’” Henson v.\nSantander Consumer USA Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1718, 1725 (2017)\n(third, fourth, and fifth alterations in original) (quoting Dodd\nv. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 357 (2005)).\n\n    But the majority’s approach also makes no sense as a\npractical matter. Under the majority’s decision, a transaction\nin which the trustee made a commercially reasonable sale of\na $200 account receivable to AgriCap and received $150 in\nreturn would not constitute a dissipation of trust assets, and\nAgriCap could keep the $200 it collected on the account\nreceivable from the retailer. But a transaction in which the\ntrustee received a $200 loan from AgriCap (secured by a\nsecurity interest in the same $200 account receivable) and\nagreed to pay back the loan when it collected the $200 from\n\f60        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nthe retailer, would constitute a dissipation of assets if the\ntrustee paid back the loan. 20 By imposing these drastically\ndivergent outcomes based on the loan-sale distinction, the\nmajority fails to heed its own advice that “courts must focus\non the true substance of PACA-related transactions and not\non artificial indicators or labels.” Maj. Op. at 25.\n\n    Moreover, the majority’s approach will hurt PACA\nbeneficiaries in the long run. If lenders face the prospect that\nany repayments they receive will be a breach of trust and\nsubject to disgorgement, they will either refuse to engage in\nfactoring transactions or impose more severe terms to\naccount for the heightened risk. 21\n\n\n    20\n        As explained above, supra p. 54, the distributor-trustees\nconstantly generate new outstanding obligations to growers in the\nordinary course of business, meaning that in practical terms, any\nrepayment could be a breach under the majority’s theory.\n\n     21\n       “[I]n desperation,” the majority attempts to distract attention from\nthe necessary implications of its own logic by pointing to policy issues,\npassing statements in oral argument, and its reliance on the Fourth\nCircuit’s similar errors. Maj. Op. at 33 n.11. Instead of reasoning and\nanalysis, the majority offers only conclusory statements. For instance,\nthe majority states “nowhere do we suggest that trusts are free to\ndisregard their obligations to lenders.” But this is contrary to the\nmajority’s own reasoning, that “whenever a loan is made, a PACA\ntrustee must be careful to ensure all trust beneficiaries are paid before\nthe lender collects.” Maj. Op. at 33. Said otherwise, a trustee cannot\nrepay the lender according to the terms of the loan. Or at all—as\nexplained above, supra p. 54, given the nature of a floating, non-\nsegregated trust, some trust beneficiaries will be unpaid at any given\ntime.\n\n    Similarly, the majority argues we should not consider the\nconsequences of its theory of breach, because it remands to the district\ncourt for a determination of damages. Maj. Op. at 33 n.11. But it\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                          61\n\n    I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\nrequires no “interested speculation and conjecture” to conclude that, if\nthe Factoring Agreement is deemed to be a loan, AgriCap would have to\nreturn all loan payments it received, up to the value of TDI’s debts to\nPalmer. See Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 607 n.2 (“As we have noted,\nbecause the accounts receivable and their proceeds were trust assets, the\nunpaid commodities sellers have a prior interest in them and can recover\nfrom AgriCap to the full satisfaction of their debts up to the limit of trust\nassets held while they remained unpaid.”).\n\f",

Tanimura sold the\nproducts on credit to third parties and transferred the\nresulting accounts receivable to AgriCap through a\ntransaction AgriCap described as a “Factoring Agreement”\nor sale of accounts. Tanimura’s business later failed, and the\ngrowers did not receive payment in full from Tanimura for\ntheir products.\n\n    The growers sued AgriCap, alleging: (1) that the\nFactoring Agreement was merely a secured lending\narrangement structured to look like a sale; (2) that the\naccounts receivable and proceeds, therefore, remained trust\nproperty under PACA; (3) that because the accounts\nreceivable remained trust property, Tanimura breached the\nPACA trust and AgriCap was complicit in the breach; and\n(4) that under PACA the PACA-trust beneficiaries,\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

The en banc court held that a court\nmust conduct a two-step inquiry when determining whether\nthe questioned transaction is a sale or creates a security\ninterest, i.e., a loan. First, a court must apply a threshold true\nsale test of which the transfer-of-risk is a key, but not the\nsole, factor.

Tanimura sold the agricultural products on\ncredit to third parties. It then transferred the resulting\naccounts receivable to Appellee AgriCap Financial\n(“AgriCap”) through a transaction AgriCap describes as a\n“Factoring Agreement” or sale of accounts. 2\n\n    Although described as a sale of accounts, the Factoring\nAgreement involved some hallmarks of a secured lending\narrangement: AgriCap referred to itself as “Lender,” and the\nwritten agreement was entitled “AgriCap Financial\nCorporation Factoring and Security Agreement.” Further,\nAgriCap was granted security interests in accounts\nreceivable and all other asset classes except inventory; UCC\nfinancing statements were filed; other debts were\nsubordinated; and there was a measure of recourse for\n\n    1\n       Growers are tomato suppliers whose various lawsuits against\nTanimura Distributing, Inc. were consolidated into one case before the\ndistrict court.\n\n    2\n       Factoring is “the commercial practice of converting receivables\ninto cash by selling them at a discount.” Boulder Fruit Express & Heger\nOrganic Farm Sales v.

PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    The district court described the cited cases as a circuit\nsplit and granted summary judgment in favor of AgriCap\nrelying on Boulder Fruit. The district court reasoned that the\nNinth Circuit in Boulder Fruit expressly addressed the\ncommercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement but\nimplicitly rejected a separate, transfer-of-risk test. The\ndistrict court further reasoned that the factoring agreement\nin Boulder Fruit transferred even less risk than did the\nFactoring Agreement here—in Boulder Fruit, the factoring\nagent enjoyed unrestricted discretion to force the distributor\nto repurchase accounts. The district court concluded that,\neven if Boulder Fruit could accommodate the transfer-of-\nrisk test, the facts of Boulder Fruit controlled and precluded\nrelief for Growers. The district court finally concluded that\nthe Factoring Agreement was commercially reasonable\nbecause AgriCap paid Tanimura 80% of the face value of the\naccounts, an amount that has never been found to be\nunreasonable, as an up-front payment and AgriCap\nultimately paid Tanimura an even greater percentage of the\nface value of the transferred accounts.\n\n    On appeal, Growers argued to the three-judge panel that\nwe are not bound by Boulder Fruit because Boulder Fruit\ndid not discuss the transfer-of-risk test, leaving open the\nquestion of whether that test should apply in the Ninth\nCircuit. AgriCap countered by contrast with its argument\nthat Boulder Fruit settled the issue because the PACA-trust\nbeneficiaries in Boulder Fruit asked the Court to apply the\ntransfer-of-risk test; the parties in that case briefed the issue;\nthe issue was squarely before the Court; and yet, the Court\ndid not apply the test.\n\n    The three-judge panel agreed with the district court’s\nconclusion that Boulder Fruit controlled the outcome in this\ncase.

PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nincluded in a PACA trust, a court needs to conduct a\nthreshold true sale inquiry before it determines whether a\ntransaction transferring PACA trust assets was a\ncommercially reasonable sale. For the reasons stated below,\nwe join the Second, Fourth and Fifth Circuits in adopting a\nthreshold true sale test to determine whether assets\ntransferred in transactions that are labeled “sales” remain\nassets of a PACA trust. We hold that a court must conduct\na two-step inquiry when determining whether the questioned\ntransaction is a sale or creates a security interest, i.e., a loan.\nFirst, a court must apply a threshold true sale test of which\nthe transfer-of-risk is a key, but not the sole, factor. If a court\nconcludes that there was a true sale, it must then determine\nif the transaction was commercially reasonable. If there was\nnot a true sale, the court’s inquiry stops there and the assets\nremain in the trust. If there was a true sale but the sale was\nnot commercially reasonable, there is a breach of the trust\nand the assets likewise remain in the trust. If, however, the\ncourt concludes that there was a true sale and that the\ntransaction was commercially reasonable, the buyer owns\nthe assets free and clear of the trust. We hold that a district\ncourt should look to the substance of the transaction to\ndetermine whether the transaction is a true sale or a secured\nloan. In doing so, the transfer of risk should be a primary\nfactor to which a court looks.\n\n                               III\n\n    We elaborate on the principles just summarized, with\nreference to pertinent authorities and reasoning.\n\n                                A\n\n    “Congress enacted PACA in 1930 to prevent unfair\nbusiness practices and promote financial responsibility in the\nfresh fruit and produce industry.” Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL             13\n\nat 1270. Congress amended PACA in 1984 “‘to remedy\n[the] burden on commerce in perishable agricultural\ncommodities and to protect the public interest’ caused by\naccounts receivable financing arrangements that ‘encumber\nor give lenders a security interest’ in the perishable\nagricultural commodities superior to the growers.” Id.\n(alteration in original) (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(1)).\nPACA creates a statutory trust in an effort to remedy this\nburden:\n\n       Perishable agricultural commodities received\n       by a commission merchant, dealer, or broker\n       in all transactions, and all inventories of food\n       or other products derived from perishable\n       agricultural      commodities,      and      any\n       receivables or proceeds from the sale of such\n       commodities or products, shall be held by\n       such commission merchant, dealer, or broker\n       in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers\n       or sellers of such commodities or agents\n       involved in the transaction, until full payment\n       of the sums owing in connection with such\n       transactions has been received by such\n       unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents.\n\n7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2). “This provision imposes a ‘non-\nsegregated floating trust’ on the commodities and their\nderivatives, and permits the commingling of trust assets\nwithout defeating the trust.” Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at\n1067 (citation omitted).\n\n   The House Report explaining the 1984 PACA\namendments states:\n\n       [Purchasers/Distributors  of   perishable\n       agricultural commodities] in the normal\n\f14     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n       course of their business transactions, operate\n       on bank loans secured by the inventories,\n       proceeds or assigned receivables from sales\n       of perishable agricultural commodities,\n       giving the lender a secured position in the\n       case of insolvency. Under present law,\n       sellers of fresh fruits and vegetables are\n       unsecured creditors and receive little\n       protection in any suit for recovery of\n       damages where a buyer has failed to make\n       payment as required by contract.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-543 at *3 (1984), as reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 407. The Second Circuit, citing this\nreport, explained:\n\n       According to Congress, due to the need to sell\n       perishable commodities quickly, sellers of\n       perishable commodities are often placed in\n       the position of being unsecured creditors of\n       companies whose creditworthiness the seller\n       is unable to verify. Due to a large number of\n       defaults by the purchasers, and the sellers’\n       status as unsecured creditors, the sellers\n       recover, if at all, only after banks and other\n       lenders who have obtained security interests\n       in the defaulting purchaser’s inventories,\n       proceeds, and receivables.\n\nEndico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1067. Given this history, it is\nevident that our focus should be upon the true nature of the\ntransactions at issue and the true nature of the parties’\nroles—that of seller and buyer or that of secured lender and\nborrower.\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               15\n\n    Perhaps most importantly, Congress intended to shield\nagricultural growers from risk in enacting PACA “to protect\nthe public interest.” 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(1). PACA’s\npurpose is not to give a one-sided boon to growers, but\ninstead, to benefit all parties and society by ensuring that\ngrowers are protected; lenders know their risk; and\nagricultural commerce is encouraged to benefit society.\n\n                              B\n\n     We apply general trust principles to questions involving\nPACA trusts, unless those principles directly conflict with\nPACA.

Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 598\n(“The assets of the trust would thus have been converted into\ncash and the receivables would no longer have been trust\nassets. Obviously, under this scenario, [the factoring agent]\nwould own the accounts receivable and would be able to do\nwith them what it wished.”); Reaves Brokerage, 336 F.3d at\n413–14 (holding that “a ‘bonafide purchaser’ of trust assets\nreceives the assets free of claims by trust beneficiaries” and\nnoting that the determinative issue on appeal is whether the\n“factoring agreement” was a loan secured by accounts\nreceivable or a true sale of accounts receivable); Boulder\nFruit, 251 F.3d at 1271–72 (“[N]othing in PACA or the\nregulations prohibits PACA trustees from attempting to turn\nreceivables into cash by factoring. To the contrary a\ncommercially reasonable sale of accounts for fair value is\nentirely consistent with the trustee’s primary duty.”); Endico\nPotatoes, 67 F.3d at 1067–69 (noting that “the well\nrecognized principle from trust law that a bona fide\npurchaser of trust assets receives the assets free of any claim\n\f           G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                   17\n\nby the trust beneficiaries” was determinative, and because\nthe financier had received only a security interest, its interest\nwas subject to the rights of the growers). That sale is, in\nsubstance, a conversion of trust assets from accounts\nreceivable into cash. See Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271.\n\n     The Second, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits have held that any\npurported security interest for a lender in PACA-trust assets\nis inferior to the trust beneficiaries’ claims and rights. See,\ne.g., Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 598–99 (“Thus, if the\naccounts receivable were held by [the factoring agent] as\ncollateral to secure repayment of a loan, they would also\nhave been held for the benefit of produce sellers, and the\nproduce sellers would have effectively enjoyed a first-\ncreditor position in them.”); Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at\n1069 (“Because [the factoring agent] held only a security\ninterest . . . its interest is subject to the rights of the PACA\ntrust beneficiaries. . . . [The factoring agent] must, therefore,\ndisgorge amounts collected on the accounts after [the\ndistributor’s] bankruptcy filing to the extent necessary to\nsatisfy claims of PACA trust beneficiaries.”); A&J Produce,\n542 F.3d at 58 (“A creditor holding ‘only a security interest,’\ntherefore, retains that interest ‘subject to the rights of the\ntrust beneficiaries.’”). Notwithstanding the absence of\ndiscussion of a “true-sale” or “transfer-of-risk” test, even\nBoulder Fruit made clear that a lender’s use of PACA-trust\nassets as collateral to secure a debt could not create a priority\nsecurity interest ahead of the position enjoyed by PACA\ntrust beneficiaries. 8\n\n\n    8\n        The Ninth Circuit stated:\n\n           Farmer sells oranges on credit to Broker. Broker turns\n           around and sells the oranges on credit to Supermarket,\n\f18      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n                                   IV\n\n    The treatment of true sales and security interests under\nPACA and trust law is reasonably clear. But what is at issue\nhere, and is not perfectly clear, is the proper analysis to apply\nwhen the true nature of the transaction is ambiguous—i.e.,\nwhen it resembles a sale in some respects and yet looks like\na secured transaction in others. Growers and the Second,\nFourth, and Fifth Circuits would apply a threshold transfer-\nof-risk test to determine if a transaction is a true sale or is\nmore accurately viewed as a secured lending relationship.\nAgriCap, relying on Boulder Fruit, argues vigorously that\nthe court need only ask if the transaction was commercially\nreasonable.\n\n                                   A\n\n    Boulder Fruit held that factoring agreements do not per\nse breach the PACA trust because “a trustee can sell trust\nassets unless the sale breaches the trust.” 251 F.3d at 1272.\nThe court concluded that “a commercially reasonable sale of\naccounts for fair value is entirely consistent with the\ntrustee’s primary duty under PACA and 7 C.F.R.\n\n        generating an account receivable from Supermarket.\n        Broker then obtains a loan from Bank and grants Bank\n        a security interest in the account receivable to secure\n        the loan. Broker goes bankrupt. Under PACA, Broker\n        is required to hold the receivable in trust for Farmer\n        until Farmer was paid in full; use of the receivable as\n        collateral was a breach of the trust. Therefore,\n        Farmer’s rights in the Supermarket receivable are\n        superior to Bank’s. In fact, as a trust asset, the\n        Supermarket receivable is not even part of the\n        bankruptcy estate.\n\nBoulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271.\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                       19\n\n§ 46.46(d)(1)—to maintain trust assets so that they are\n‘freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers\nof perishable commodities.’” Id. at 1271. Boulder Fruit\nreasoned that the commercial reasonableness of a factoring\nagreement depends upon the terms of the agreement. For\nexample, “[a] PACA trustee who sells accounts for pennies\non the dollar, just to turn a quick buck, might well have\nbreached the PACA trust, while a trustee who factors\naccounts at a commercially reasonable rate would not.” Id.\n\n    The Boulder Fruit panel, in reaching its conclusion, said\nthat the factoring agreement “actually enhanced the trust.”\nId. at 1272. Boulder Fruit considered not only the initial up-\nfront payment from the factoring agent to the distributor but\nalso the actual sums paid to the distributor by the factoring\nagent while performing the factoring agreement. 9 Id.\nBoulder Fruit did not, however, examine the substance of\nthe rights transferred to determine what the factoring agent\nagreed to do, what risk the factoring agent accepted when it\naccepted the right to collect on the transferred accounts, and\nwhether the transaction should properly be deemed a true\nsale rather than a mere secured lending arrangement. Rather,\nBoulder Fruit characterized the transaction as a sale or\nfactoring agreement without discussing the factoring agent’s\nrights and ability to seek recourse against the distributor.\n\n   In sharp contrast, the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits\nfound it necessary to examine the rights and risks transferred\nbetween the parties to a factoring agreement. The courts in\n    9\n      The 20% discount at issue in Boulder Fruit represented a discount\nfrom the accounts’ face value as paid in an initial payment from the\nfactoring agent to the PACA trustee. It did not represent the final amount\npaid nor did it represent a floor or a ceiling on what the factoring\nagreement in Boulder Fruit could have required the factoring agent to\npay.\n\f20      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nthese cases examined the text and legislative history of\nPACA and the regulations promulgated under PACA to\nconclude that Congress intended to promote the interests of\nproduce growers above the interests of secured lenders. See,\ne.g., Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 594–95, 598–99; Endico\nPotatoes, 67 F.3d at 1066–68. The Fourth Circuit stressed\nthat representatives of the secured lending community had\nvoiced concern over PACA’s likely effect upon secured\nlenders and the factoring industry. Nickey Gregory,\n597 F.3d at 599. That court concluded that Congress\nnevertheless found that the balance of policy interests\nfavored placing those lenders in a position inferior to unpaid\ngrowers. Id.\n\n    The Endico Potatoes court resolved a case wherein\nMerberg, a dealer in perishable agricultural commodities\nreceived financing from CIT, and CIT held security interests\nin all Merberg’s assets including accounts receivable.\n67 F.3d at 1066. Merberg went through a bankruptcy and\nthe growers sought reimbursement from CIT for the amounts\nleft unpaid. Id. The court defined the issue before it as\nwhether the transaction between CIT and Merberg\nconstituted a purchase for value or whether the exchange\ngave CIT no more than a security interest. Id. at 1068. The\ncourt reasoned, “[i]n determining the substance of the\ntransaction, the Court may look to a number of factors,\nincluding the right of the creditor to recover from the debtor\nany deficiency if the assets assigned are not sufficient to\nsatisfy the debt, the effect on the creditor’s right to the assets\nassigned if the debtor were to pay the debt from independent\nfunds, whether the debtor has a right to any funds recovered\nfrom the sale of assets above that necessary to satisfy the\ndebt, and whether the assignment itself reduces debt.” Id.\nThat court found, “[t]the root of all of these factors is the\ntransfer of risk.” Id. at 1069. The court relied upon the fact\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                         21\n\nthat the agreement had a provision that let CIT demand\npayment at any time and a provision that terminated CIT’s\ninterest if Merberg paid its outstanding obligation. Id. The\ncourt held that because CIT only held a security interest in\nMerberg’s accounts receivable, CIT’s interest was subject to\nthe rights of the PACA trust beneficiaries. Id.\n\n    A question may be raised whether the Second Circuit no\nlonger espouses the view that the substance of an agreement\nmust be analyzed when determining the rights of the parties.\nIn E.

Reaves sued Fidelity Factors,\nLLC, because Fidelity had purchased particular accounts\nreceivable from Sunbelt. Id. The court framed the issue\nbefore it as whether the “factoring agreement” between\nSunbelt and Fidelity was a loan secured by accounts\nreceivable or a sale of accounts receivable. Id. at 414. The\ncourt reasoned that the “[c]haracterization of the agreement\nturns on the ‘substance of the relationship’ between Fidelity\nand Sunbelt, ‘not simply the label attached to the\ntransaction.’” Id. The court looked to the Second Circuit’s\nrisk-transfer analysis and also conducted an independent\n\nfacilitate a PACA dealer’s fulfillment of his obligations to PACA\nbeneficiaries.” Id. at 133.\n\f       G.W.

The court\nreasoned that the agreement and its provisions, when read in\ntheir entirety, “confirm that the risk of non-payment or\nunderpayment is entirely borne by Sunbelt.” Id. at 415\n(emphasis in original). The court pointed to continuing lien\nand single indebtedness language, a personal guaranty from\nSunbelt’s president, and recordation of the agreement with\nthe UCC to support its conclusion. Id. at 416. The court also\ndistinguished Boulder Fruit because it found that the\ncommercially reasonable analysis did not apply when the\nfactoring agreement is the “functional equivalent” of a\nsecured lending agreement, noting that the “discrete issue\nbefore the Boulder Fruit court was whether an\nacknowledged factoring agreement was ‘commercially\nreasonable’.” Id. at 417 (emphasis in original).\n\n    In Nickey Gregory, the Fourth Circuit addressed a case\nwhere Robison Farms, a distributor of produce, bought\nproduce from growers on short-term credit, and distributed\nthe produce to restaurants and school systems on credit\ncreating accounts receivable. 597 F.3d at 596. When\nRobison Farms began experiencing financial difficulties it\nsought a line of credit from AgriCap and assigned the\naccounts receivable to AgriCap in exchange for an advance\nof 80% of the face value of the accounts. Id. AgriCap\ncollected the accounts receivable, kept the 80% for itself,\nand remitted the remaining 20% to Robison Farms minus\nfees and interest. Id. Notwithstanding the credit agreement,\nRobison Farms closed its doors without paying the growers\nwhat was owing and filed for bankruptcy. Id. at 596–97.\nThe court framed the issue before it as whether the district\ncourt erred in concluding that AgriCap’s transaction was a\nloan agreement. Id at 600. The Fourth Circuit upheld the\n\f24      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the transaction was a loan\nagreement because (1) AgriCap referred to itself as a\n“Lender” and Robison Farms a “Borrower” in the\nagreement, (2) Robison farms did not transfer risk of\nnoncollection of accounts receivable to AgriCap—AgriCap\nhad a right to demand that Robison Farms repurchase any\nreceivable that went unpaid or was disputed, (3) documents\nrelated to the transaction referred to the accounts receivable\nas collateral for repayment, (4) AgriCap had a Subordination\nAgreement that gave it “a first priority security interest in the\nCollateral”, (5) the owner of Robison Farms gave AgriCap a\npersonal guarantee, and (6) AgriCap filed a UCC-1\nFinancing Statement for the transaction. Id. at 601–03. The\ncourt concluded that the substantive aspects of the\ntransaction were inconsistent with a sale of assets, and that\nthe transaction was in “essence a loan in the form of a\nrevolving line of credit secured by accounts receivable.” Id.\nat 603. The court finally concluded that because the\ntransaction was a loan, the accounts receivable and their\nproceeds never left the PACA trust, and their proceeds had\nto be made available for payment of the claims of unpaid\nPACA creditors first. Id.\n\n    The Fourth Circuit distinguished Boulder Fruit\nconcluding that in Boulder Fruit there was a “true factoring\nrelationship, in which the receivables were actually sold to\nthe factor.” Id. at 604. The Fourth Circuit found that\nBoulder Fruit did not question whether there had actually\nbeen a sale. Id. at 604.\n\n    The weight of authority and reasoning in the Second,\nFourth and Fifth Circuit cases suggest that “transfer of risk”\nand “true sale” considerations should be assessed before\nconsidering commercial reasonableness when considering\nthe propriety of a transfer of trust assets. We conclude that\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               25\n\nadoption of the transfer-of-risk test or true sale test is the\nlogical outcome of a reading of PACA, PACA’s legislative\nhistory, and consideration of PACA’s purpose.\n\n                               B\n\n    Given the remedy that Congress created to alleviate the\nperceived problem of conflict in rights of agricultural\ngrowers and secured lenders—creation of the trust elevating\ncommodities sellers’ interests over lenders’ interests—\nCongress’s clear concern with the relative interests of\nsecured lenders and commodities sellers, and the general\ncontours of trust law—in particular, a trustee’s ability to sell\nor convert trust assets—courts must focus on the true\nsubstance of PACA-related transactions and not on artificial\nindicators or labels. It runs counter to PACA and its history\nto allow the simple use of the words “sale,” “purchase,” or\n“factoring agreement” to be central for purposes of assessing\nthe relative rights of lenders and produce growers.\n\n    AgriCap at oral argument asserted that the AgriCap\ntransaction benefitted Growers as AgriCap paid Tanimura\nmore than the 80% discount on the accounts receivable and\nnever used the recourse provision. The Second, Fourth, and\nFifth Circuits conclude, however, that a transfer of the\nprimary or direct risk of non-payment on the accounts is the\nhallmark of a true sale.

PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nto the trustee under the agreement. See, e.g., 7 C.F.R.\n§ 46.46(a)(2) (“‘Dissipation’ means any act or failure to act\nwhich could result in the diversion of trust assets or which\ncould prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers,\nsellers, or agents to recover money owed in connection with\nproduce transactions.”).\n\n    In assessing whether a true sale occurred, the Fourth\nCircuit adopted the transfer-of-risk test developed by the\nSecond Circuit in Endico Potatoes. Nickey Gregory,\n597 F.3d at 600–03. There, the Second Circuit distinguished\nbetween direct risk and secondary or derivative risk. Endico\nPotatoes, 67 F.3d at 1068–69. The Endico court said that it\nwas appropriate to examine several factors such as “[1] the\nright of the creditor to recover from the debtor any\ndeficiency if the assets assigned are not sufficient to satisfy\nthe debt, [2] the effect on the creditor’s right to the assets\nassigned if the debtor were to pay the debt from independent\nfunds, [3] whether the debtor has a right to any funds\nrecovered from the sale of assets above that necessary to\nsatisfy the debt, and [4] whether the assignment itself\nreduces the debt.” Endico Potatoes, 67 F.3d at 1068. The\ncourt in Endico Potatoes concluded: “The root of all of these\nfactors is the transfer of risk.” Id. at 1069. Finally, the court\nthere summarized:\n\n        Where the lender has purchased the accounts\n        receivable, the borrower’s debt is\n        extinguished and the lender’s risk with regard\n        to the performance of the accounts is direct,\n        that is, the lender and not the borrower bears\n        the risk of non-performance by the account\n        debtor. If the lender holds only a security\n        interest, however, the lender’s risk is\n        derivative or secondary, that is, the borrower\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               27\n\n       remains liable for the debt and bears the risk\n       of non-payment by the account debtor, while\n       the lender only bears the risk that the account\n       debtor’s non-payment will leave the\n       borrower unable to satisfy the loan.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\n    We conclude that this transfer-of-risk test should be\napplied to avoid reliance on labels in factoring agreements\nthat would defeat the purposes of PACA. As Judge Melloy\nreasoned in his separate concurrence in the three-judge\npanel’s decision: “A factoring agent who accepts risk of non-\npayment on the transferred accounts is the owner of the\naccounts, for better or worse . . . [internal citation omitted].\nThat risk will be reflected in the price. A factoring agent\nwho functionally serves only as a lender and collection firm,\nhowever, accepts accounts for collection but enjoys the right\nto force the distributor to repurchase non-performing\naccounts. Such a factoring agent faces much less risk—risk\nmeasured only by the limitations on the repurchase\nprovisions and by the distributor’s solvency and ability to\nperform under the agreement.” S & H Packing & Sales Co.,\n850 F.3d at 457. The price paid for the accounts with and\nwithout recourse will differ.\n\n    AgriCap nevertheless argues that adoption of the\ntransfer-of-risk test would lead to absurd results in which a\nfactoring agent remains liable to growers even though the\nfactoring agent’s payments to a distributor were sufficient,\nin theory, for the distributor to pay growers. AgriCap is\nwrong to describe such a scenario as absurd. It is instead the\nresult of a congressional policy choice. There is an analogy\nin the relationship between general contractors,\nsubcontractors, and property owners in the context of\n\f28     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nmechanics’ liens. It is well established that a property owner\nwho makes final payment to a general contractor without\nfirst securing a release of subcontractors’ mechanics’ liens\nholds the property subject to those liens with exposure to the\nsubcontractors’ claims despite substantial payments to the\ngeneral contractor. See, e.g., Jackson v. Flohr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n611 (9th Cir. 1955) (“Mechanics’ liens are provided by\nstatute in order to give the furnisher of labor and material,\nsecurity against the realty so that it is unnecessary to rely\nupon the personal responsibility of the contractor.” ); Brewer\nCorp. v. Point Ctr. Fin., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839\n(2014), as modified on denial of reh’g (Feb. 27, 2014) (“A\nmechanic’s lien is a claim against real property, which may\nbe filed if a claimant has provided labor or furnished\nmaterials for the property and has not been paid.”); Gary C.\nTanko Well Drilling, Inc. v. Dodds, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n593 (Ct. App. 1981) (explaining that a mechanic’s lien is the\nremedy provided by the California Constitution for\nenforcing against the owner of property payment of the debt\nincurred for the performance of labor, or the furnishing of\nmaterial used in construction). Unpaid subcontractors will\nhave interests that prevail over the property owner (who may\nseek recourse against the general contractor, but who still\nface direct liability to the subcontractors on their liens).\nState legislative action places the interests of subcontractors\nahead of those of property owners. Property owners must\nmanage this risk by diligently ensuring that subcontractors’\nliens are released before giving full payment to a general\ncontractor.\n\n    Similarly, by placing the burden of due diligence on\nlenders rather than growers, Congress was well aware of the\neffect it was imposing on the lending industry. As Judge\nMelloy previously observed, “Congress concluded,\nhowever, that lenders could adapt. The House Committee\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL             29\n\nexpressly noted that anticipated improvements to commerce\nwould offset the lenders’ anticipated burdens.” S & H\nPacking & Sales Co., 850 F.3d at 458; see also H.R. Rep.\nNo. 98-543 at *4 (“[T]he statutory trust requirements will\nnot be a burden to lending institutions. They will be known\nto and considered by prospective lenders in extending credit.\nThe assurance the trust provision gives that raw products\nwill be paid for promptly and that there is a monitoring\nsystem provided for under [PACA] will protect the interests\nof the borrower, the money lender, and the fruit and\nvegetable industry.”).\n\n    The propriety of comparing the PACA situation to\nmechanics’ liens finds support in an examination of the\nregulations promulgated under PACA. Again, the reasoning\nin Judge Melloy’s concurrence is helpful: “These regulations\ndo not ask whether a factoring arrangement in fact resulted\nin a transfer of funds sufficient to pay growers throughout\nthe course of performance under a factoring agreement.\nRather, the regulations ask whether such an arrangement\ncould impair trust assets. See 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(a)(2). Just\nas a property owner must conduct due diligence to avoid\nliability to a subcontractor before making final payment to a\ngeneral contractor, a factoring agent with knowledge of\nPACA must act with diligence. It does not matter that a\nfactoring agent paid a distributor sufficient funds to pay\ngrowers any more than it matters that a property owner paid\na general contractor sufficient funds to pay subcontractors.\nIn light of these statutory and common law protections, it\ncannot properly be the case that a distributor and factoring\nagent may defeat trust beneficiaries’ rights merely by\ninvoking the labels ‘sale’ or ‘factoring agreement.’” S & H\nPacking & Sales Co., 850 F.3d at 458.\n\f30      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    Further, there would seem to be no doubt that a\nlegislature has the power to define and limit liens. See Mercy\nHosp. & Med. Ctr. v. Farmers Ins. Grp. of Companies,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (Cal. 1997) (“Whatever principles might\ngenerally apply to liens, former section 3045.4 is a statutory,\nnot a common law, lien. The Legislature is, of course, free\nto define and limit such a lien, and has done so in this case.”).\nAs recognized under California law, when there are\ncompeting liens, “the text of the statute prevails if it\nestablishes the priority to be accorded to the statutory lien.”\nCounty of San Bernardino v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1112 (2007). The Calderon court concluded that the\nCalifornia’s statutory hospital lien did not have priority over\nother liens by right, stating, “other liens may take priority”.\nId. at 1113 (citing Cal. Civ. Code § 3045.4). The court\nreasoned that the California legislature knew how to create\nexpress priority as evidenced by its treatment of a county’s\nright to action against a third party for reimbursement, where\nthe statute states that the county has a “first lien”. Id. (citing\nGov. Code § 23004.1). Other examples of states creating\npriority interests over secured creditors are seen in Iowa’s\nagricultural supply dealer lien statute and Wisconsin’s tow\ntruck statutory lien. In Iowa, agricultural supply dealers\nhave a “super priority” interest above bank lenders in the\nlivestock of the farmers. In re Schley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658\n(Bankr. N.D. Iowa 2017) (“An agricultural supply dealer\nwho provides an agricultural supply to a farmer shall have\nan agricultural lien as provided in section 554.9102.”); see\nIowa Code § 570A.5. In Wisconsin, a person who has the\nlicense to perform towing services and does so has a priority\ninterest, up to a statutory amount, over a bank’s lien and has\na right to retain possession of the vehicle until its costs are\nsatisfied. See In re Ingram, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (Bankr. E.D.\nWis. 2014); Wis. Stat. § 779.415(1g)(a). Indeed, whenever\nwe deal with competing liens, whether established by\n\f       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               31\n\nlegislations or common law, we deal not with the question\nof whether a party has a valid debt obligation that is secured\nand should be paid, but rather with the question of which\nclaimant to funds has priority.\n\n    Similarly here, Congress has made a clear policy choice\ngiving PACA creditors priority over secured creditors. We\nmust keep PACA’s purpose in mind when reviewing\ntransactions that may in substance limit that congressional\npolicy.\n\n                              C\n\n    The dissent is not incorrect in asserting that the\ndistinction between a sale and a secured lending agreement\ndoes not ordinarily make a difference under general trust\nprinciples, so long as the transaction at issue is commercially\nreasonable. But we respectfully and forcefully disagree that\nthis is true in the context of a PACA trust. See Boulder Fruit,\n251 F.3d at 1271 (“[G]eneral trust principles [apply] to\nquestions involving the PACA trust, unless those principles\ndirectly conflict with PACA.”).\n\n    PACA was enacted to protect trust beneficiaries, who\nwere often in the position of unsecured creditors, from\nreceiving little or nothing when a distributor went bankrupt.\nSee 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(1). The dissent is not completely\nblind to the policy motivation behind PACA of protecting\ngrowers over lenders, but we think the dissent gives too little\nweight to the protective purpose of PACA. The dissent\nstrives to add protection for the benefit of lenders, but loses\nsight of the PACA statutory language establishing the PACA\ntrust, and disregards the purpose of PACA to protect\nagricultural growers.\n\f32      G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    To accomplish its protective purpose, PACA\nsubordinates all secured creditor rights to the rights of the\nunpaid growers and charges the PACA trustee to preserve\nthe rights of trust beneficiaries by making sure that PACA\ntrust assets—the accounts receivable—are not dissipated.\nSee id. at § 499e(c)(2); 7 C.F.R. 46.46(d)(1) (“[Trustees] are\nrequired to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets\nare freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to\nsellers of perishable agricultural commodities. Any act or\nomission which is inconsistent with this responsibility,\nincluding dissipation of trust assets, is unlawful and in\nviolation of section 2 of the Act.”). When there is a sale of\nassets—as relevant here, accounts receivable—there is a\nconversion of the assets from one form, accounts receivable,\nto another, cash. See Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271. The\naccounts receivable are no longer in the trust, and therefore,\nthere cannot be a dissipation of trust assets from the buyer’s\nlater collection on those receivables.\n\n    When there is a secured lending agreement or loan,\nhowever, the accounts receivable remain trust assets and are\nonly collateral to the lender. See Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d\nat 603. In that context, the trustee under PACA is obligated\nnot to dissipate those trust assets. See id. at 604. As the court\nin Nickey Gregory correctly concluded, in those\ncircumstances, there is a breach of trust whenever the lender\nrecovers its fee or percentage from the accounts receivable\nwhile the trust beneficiaries have not been fully\ncompensated. 597 F.3d at 604; see 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(a)(2)\n(precluding the trustee from participating in “any act or\nfailure to act which could result in the diversion of trust\nassets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of\nunpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents to recover money owed\nin connection with produce transactions”). This does not\nmean that every loan or lending agreement made to a\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                           33\n\ndistributor acts to breach a PACA trust, but it does mean that\nwhenever a loan is made, a PACA trustee must be careful to\nensure all trust beneficiaries are paid before the lender\ncollects. If a trustee gives a lender a security interest in\nPACA trust assets, and the growers are not fully repaid, that\nwould be a breach of the PACA trust and a violation of\nPACA.\n\n    Here, whether the transaction at issue was a sale or a loan\nmakes a difference because a sale removes the accounts\nreceivable from the PACA trust while the enforcement of a\nloan in this case would have breached the PACA trust\nbecause AgriCap received its full payment while GW Palmer\nremained unpaid. Therefore, the district court must\ndetermine whether the transaction was in substance a sale or\na loan. 11\n\n\n    11\n        The dissent seeks to give financial institutions the edge in this case\nover agricultural growers.         But the analysis of the dissent is\nfundamentally flawed because it elevates the interests of financial\ninstitutions, the factoring organization AgriCap, over the interests of\nagricultural growers who PACA aimed to protect. As examples:\n\n    •    First, the dissent says that “[t]he majority posits that the growers\n         have a priority lien on their produce, which allows the trust to\n         accept the benefit of a loan agreement but disregard the\n         obligation to repay it.” Dissent at 37. But nowhere do we\n         suggest that trusts are free to disregard their obligations to\n         lenders. A trustee cannot, however, enforce an obligation to a\n         lender above its statutory obligation to trust beneficiaries to not\n         dissipate trust assets.\n\n    •    Second, the dissent suggests that if “the trustee still owed\n         AgriCap money on the loan, then AgriCap would be entitled to\n         foreclose its security interest on the accounts receivable\n         according to the terms of the loan agreement.” Dissent at 53\n         n.15. This argument exceeds what even the Appellee AgriCap\n\f34       G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n\n\n\n         understands PACA to allow. AgriCap’s counsel admitted\n         during oral argument, that if it was a true lending agreement,\n         any interest that it had in the accounts receivable as a creditor\n         would be subordinate to the growers. Ninth Circuit Court of\n         Appeals, Oral Argument 14-56069 G.W. Palmer v.

Dissent at 60–61 n.21. That\n         is incorrect. We have stated what we believe to be the proper\n         test for the district court to employ in the first instance, realizing\n         the limits of our ability to review issues like damages when\n         there is no prior development of the record on appeal on those\n         and related issues.

Further, while challenging the strength of\n         the various circuit precedents that we contend are aligned with\n         our decision, the dissent unmistakably concedes that its position\n         would squarely conflict with the decision of the Fourth Circuit\n         in Nickey Gregory. Dissent at 54–55. The dissent makes this\n         concession arguing more or less that it thinks Nickey Gregory\n         is “critically flawed.” Dissent at 52. However, given the\n         language and purposes of PACA, we see no reason why we\n         should engineer a conflict with the Fourth Circuit’s decision in\n         Nickey Gregory.

PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                      35\n\n                                   V\n\n    Congress intended PACA to prevent secured lenders\nfrom defeating the rights of PACA-trust beneficiaries. The\ngrowers in this Circuit will have effectively lost that\nprotection if lenders gain protection by labeling what are in\nsubstance security agreements as if they were factoring\nagreements. The Congressional focus upon the relative\nrights of these two groups, growers and lenders, is evident.\nFor this reason, before a court assesses the commercial\nreasonableness of a factoring agreement, it should first\nexamine the substance of a factoring agreement to ensure\nthat a true sale of the accounts receivable has occurred.\nAbsent a true sale, the labels surrounding a factoring\nagreement should be of little or no consequence. The\nsubstance of the transaction controls. If the substance of a\ntransaction reveals a secured lending arrangement rather\nthan a true sale, the accounts receivable remain trust assets.\nIn that case, unpaid trust beneficiaries will hold an interest\nin accounts receivable and their proceeds superior to all\nunsecured and secured creditors such that the trust\nbeneficiaries should prevail. 12\n\n    The dominant consideration here is that the Congress of\nthe United States in its language in the PACA statute and in\nthe policy considerations underlying PACA has made a clear\nchoice that the rights of agricultural growers are to be given\npriority over the rights of secured lenders through the vehicle\nof the PACA trust. If Tanimura made a true sale of its\nreceivables to AgriCap, acting as a factor, and if it was for\nfair value and a commercially reasonable amount, then the\n\n    12\n       We note that the calculation of damages, if applicable, is left to\nthe district court to review in the first instance after determining the\nsubstance of the accounts receivable transactions.\n\f36        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nPACA trust was not offended. But on the other hand, if the\nchallenged transaction was not a true sale but rather a\nsecured lending arrangement, then the plaintiff Growers\nhave a claim that must be resolved in further proceedings.\nWhat makes this case difficult is that the challenged\ntransaction has some features both of a sale and of a loan.\nOn remand the district court may use all the tools at its\ndisposal, consistent with what we have said in this opinion,\nincluding the taking of testimony and making findings of\nfact, to determine whether the agreement was in substance a\ntrue sale or in substance a lending agreement, and thereafter\nto proceed in a way consistent with this opinion.\n\n    We hold that before considering the commercial\nreasonableness of a transaction, a court must first apply a\nthreshold true sale test for which the transfer-of-risk is a\nprimary factor. 13 To the extent that our en banc opinion\ntoday contradicts Boulder Fruit, we overrule Boulder Fruit.\n\n    We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n     Each party shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       There remain other questions about when the transactions are\nreviewed and whether to apply the test asset-by-asset or taken together.\nWe leave to the district court’s discretion to determine the appropriate\nprocedure for conducting this analysis as the district court is in a better\nposition to do so after briefing from the parties on these issues.\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                37\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge, with whom HURWITZ and\nFRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:\n\n    Congress enacted the Perishable Agricultural\nCommodities Act (PACA) trust, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c), to solve\na simple problem. Most produce growers sell their products\nto distributors on credit. If the distributor goes bankrupt, the\ngrowers are mere unsecured creditors and may only get cents\non the dollar. The distributor’s secured creditors, by\ncontrast, get first crack at the distributor’s assets. To address\nthis problem, PACA made the distributor a trustee, the\ngrowers beneficiaries, and the growers’ produce (and any\nresulting proceeds) trust assets. Congress thus ensured that\nin bankruptcy, the proceeds from the sale of the growers’\nproduce would be available to pay off the growers.\n\n    The appeal before us today poses a related scenario: If a\nPACA trustee borrows money from a lender (using the trust\nassets as collateral) in order to pay the growers, but the\nmoney runs out before all the growers are paid, does the\nlender have an obligation to make the unpaid growers\nwhole? The majority says yes: if the trustee fails to\nreimburse the growers, the lender is on the hook. The\nmajority posits that the growers have a priority lien on their\nproduce, which allows the trust to accept the benefit of a loan\nagreement but disregard the obligation to repay it. Because\nthis surprising conclusion is unmoored from both the text of\nPACA and settled principles of trust law, I dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n    Congress initially enacted PACA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 499a–\n499t, in 1930 to protect growers who marketed and sold their\nproduce through intermediaries. PACA did not originally\nmake growers beneficiaries of a trust. Rather, it required all\nintermediary distributors—commission merchants, dealers,\n\f38     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nand brokers—to operate under licenses issued by the\nSecretary of Agriculture. 7 U.S.C. §§ 499c, 499d (1930).\nPACA also prohibited these distributors from engaging in a\nnumber of unfair business practices, such as failing to make\nprompt and full payment to growers. Id. §§ 499b, 499e.\n\n    Over time, it became evident that PACA gave growers\ninsufficient protection when distributors went bankrupt.\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 3 (1983), as reprinted in 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 407. As the House Committee explained\nin its report on the proposed 1984 Amendments, sales of\nperishable goods “must be made quickly or they are not\nmade at all.” Id. As a result, produce growers are usually\ncompelled to sell their goods on credit, even though it is\n“often difficult to make credit checks, conditional sales\nagreements, and tak[e] other traditional safeguards.” Id.\n\n    This led to especially harsh consequences when\ndistributors went bankrupt. Distributors typically operate\n“on bank loans secured by the inventories, proceeds or\nassigned receivables from sales of perishable agricultural\ncommodities.” Id. Before Congress intervened, a distributor\ncould give the lender a security interest in all its assets,\nincluding the produce it had purchased from growers on\ncredit and accounts receivable it received from the sale of\nthe produce to retailers. If the distributor went bankrupt, the\nlender would have a secured claim in everything the\ndistributor owned. In contrast, the growers would be\n“unsecured creditors and receive little protection in any suit\nfor recovery of damages where a buyer has failed to make\npayment as required by the contract.” Id. The unsecured\ngrowers would often receive only cents on the dollar on the\ndistributor’s unsecured IOUs. See A Bill to Amend the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930: Hearing on\nS. 2052 Before the Subcomm. on Agric. Prod., Mktg. &\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V.

Comm. on Agric., Nutrition\n& Forestry, 98th Cong. 14 (1983) (statement of Keith Eckel,\nPresident, Pennsylvania Farmers’ Association, on behalf of\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation). A bankruptcy court\ncould even recapture payments the distributor had made to a\ngrower within 90 days of a bankruptcy and use them to pay\nother creditors. Id.; see also 11 U.S.C. § 547.\n\n    In light of this concern, Congress added a trust\nmechanism to PACA in 1984. H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 4.\nThe 1984 Amendments’ operative trust provision, 7 U.S.C.\n§ 499e(c)(2), requires a distributor to hold “perishable\nagricultural commodities, and any receivables or proceeds\nfrom the sale of such commodities or products . . . in trust\nfor the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers” until the\ndistributor makes full payment to its growers. 1 This means\nthat the distributor is a trustee, the growers’ produce (and all\nproceeds from sales of the produce) are the trust res, and the\ngrowers are beneficiaries.\n\n                                   A\n\n    We “apply general trust principles to questions involving\nthe PACA trust, unless those principles directly conflict with\n    1\n       The 1984 Amendments also created a procedure for enforcing trust\nrights. Section 499e(c)(3) provided that a beneficiary must preserve its\nright to benefits by issuing written notice to the trustee within 30 days\nafter the trustee’s failure to make payment. 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(3).\nSection 499e(c)(4) allowed a beneficiary to alternatively preserve its\nrights through standardized language on billing or invoice statements.\nSection 499e(c)(5) vested jurisdiction in federal district courts to hear\n“(i) actions by trust beneficiaries to enforce payment from the trust, and\n(ii) actions by the Secretary to prevent and restrain dissipation of the\ntrust.” The plaintiffs in this case included the standardized language on\ntheir invoices to Tanimura Distributing, Inc.

First, by\nmaking the distributor a trustee and the growers’ produce\nand the proceeds trust assets, Congress transformed how\nthese assets are treated in bankruptcy. A PACA trustee-\ndistributor wears two hats in a bankruptcy proceeding. All\nof the debtor’s own assets are subject to the claims of its\ncreditors. But the trust assets do not belong to the debtor;\nthe distributor as trustee holds only a nonbeneficial, bare\nlegal title to such assets. Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 42\n\n     2\n        The current trend is to rely on both the Second and Third\nRestatements of Trusts. See, e.g., United States v.

Law Comm’n 2000). This includes\nthe authority “to sell trust property . . . in exchange for other\nproperty,” Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 86 cmt. c, and the\n“power to borrow money for trust purposes and to pledge,\nmortgage, grant a deed of trust, or otherwise encumber trust\nproperty,” id. § 86 cmt. d. Any money obtained from such\ntransactions becomes an asset of the trust estate. Third-party\nlenders or purchasers dealing with a trustee generally hold\nthe assets or security interest free of the trust. See\n\n    3\n      Because the PACA trust is a “nonsegregated ‘floating’ trust,” it\npermits “[c]ommingling of trust assets.” 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(b); H.R. Rep.\nNo. 98-543, at 4. Commingling relieves trustees of the burden “to\nspecifically identify all of the trust assets through each step” of\nadministering the trust. H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 5.\n\f42          G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nRestatement (Second) of Trusts § 283 (Am. Law. Inst.\n1959). 4 The buyer or lender has no duty to “ensure that\nassets transferred to the trustee are properly applied to trust\npurposes.” Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 108(3)(b). Even\nwhen the trustee breaches its fiduciary duty, someone who\n“takes for value and without notice of the breach of trust,” is\na “bona fide” transferee, “holds the interest so transferred or\ncreated free of the trust, and is under no liability to the\nbeneficiary.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 284. 5\n\n    There is an important exception to this rule. If (1) the\ntrustee breaches its fiduciary duties when selling a trust asset\nor granting a security interest in a trust asset, and (2) the third\nparty is on notice of this breach, the third party does not take\nthe asset or security interest free of the trust. Restatement\n(Second) of Trusts § 288. Rather, the third party takes the\nasset in “a constructive trust for the beneficiary of the trust,”\nid. § 288 cmt. a., and may be compelled to restore the asset\n\n     4\n         Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 283 states:\n\n            If the trustee transfers trust property to a third person\n            or creates a legal or equitable interest in the subject\n            matter of the trust in a third person, and the trustee in\n            making the transfer or in creating the interest does not\n            commit a breach of trust, the third person holds the\n            interest so transferred or created free of the trust, and\n            is under no liability to the beneficiary.\n\n     5\n       Although the Second Restatement uses the term “bona fide\npurchaser,” the term also applies when the trustee “creates a legal\ninterest” in trust property, § 284(1), such as by giving “a legal mortgage\nor pledge or legal lien upon the trust property,” id. § 284 cmt. g. In other\nwords, a lender’s security interest may be protected by the bona fide\npurchaser defense, even if the trustee breached its fiduciary duty by\ngranting the interest.\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                           43\n\nor any proceeds derived from it, id. § 291(1). 6 A trustee may\nbreach its fiduciary duties by failing to “exercise caution . . .\ncare and skill in deciding whether and under what terms to\nborrow money for trust purposes or to grant a security\ninterest in trust property,” Restatement (Third) of Trusts\n§ 86 cmt. d, or by acting in a similarly careless manner when\nselling trust property, id. § 86 cmts. b, c. Therefore, a trustee\nbreaches its fiduciary duty if it enters into an agreement with\na third party that is not commercially reasonable. See\nBoulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at 1271–72. 7\n\n\n\n    6\n       Equity recognizes some exceptions to this rule. A third party that\nhas conferred a benefit on the trust estate may be entitled to\nreimbursement from trust assets. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of\nTrusts § 291 cmt. o (“If the trustee in breach of trust transfers trust\nproperty to a person who takes with notice of the breach of trust and who\npays value for the trust property, and the beneficiary compels him to\nrestore the property to the trust or to account for its value or for the\nproceeds, the transferee is entitled to credit for the amount which he paid\nfor the trust property to the extent to which the trust estate has the benefit\nthereof.”); id. § 269 (“A person who has conferred a benefit on the trust\nestate and cannot obtain satisfaction of his claim out of the trustee's\nindividual property can by a proceeding in equity reach trust property\nand apply it to the satisfaction of his claim to the extent to which the trust\nestate has been benefited, unless under the circumstances it is inequitable\nto allow him such remedy.”); see also Thomas v.

PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\n    Nothing in PACA alters these basic trust principles. A\nPACA trustee, like any other trustee, has authority to sell\ntrust assets or borrow money secured by an interest in trust\nproperty. See Preamble to Regulations Under the Perishable\nAgricultural Commodities Act, 49 Fed. Reg. 45,735, 45,738\n(Nov. 20, 1984) (codified at 7 C.F.R. pt. 46) (stating that “the\nregulations do not prohibit a buyer or receiver from granting\na secured interest in trust assets”); see also Nickey Gregory,\n597 F.3d at 600 (holding that PACA permits the PACA\ntrustee to transfer accounts receivable to a lender “as\ncollateral for a secured loan”). And like any trustee, a\nPACA trustee is liable if it breaches its fiduciary duty. The\nDepartment’s regulations require the distributor-trustee to\nmaintain trust assets “to satisfy outstanding obligations to\nsellers of perishable agricultural commodities” and prohibit\n“[a]ny act or omission which is inconsistent with this\nresponsibility, including dissipation of trust assets.”\n7 C.F.R. § 46.46(d)(1). 8\n\n                                   B\n\n    The facts in this case must be understood in light of these\nprinciples. Tanimura Distributing, Inc. (TDI) was in the\nbusiness of distributing produce. TDI bought produce on\ncredit from numerous growers, including the plaintiffs in this\naction (collectively, “Palmer”). TDI then resold this produce\nto retail outlets, usually on credit.

Let’s say Palmer sells four bushels of\ntomatoes to TDI for $100 on credit. Per PACA, TDI holds\nthe bushels in trust. See 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2). TDI (as\ntrustee) then sells the four bushels to Safeway for $200, and\ntakes back an IOU, which is an asset of the trust. Under the\nFactoring Agreement, TDI assigns the $200 Safeway IOU to\nAgriCap as the “absolute owner.” In exchange, AgriCap\npromptly pays TDI 80 percent of the face value of the $200\naccount receivable, $160. This $160 becomes an asset of the\ntrust, held by TDI for the benefit of Palmer and other\ngrowers who sell to TDI on credit. After AgriCap collects\nthe $200 from Safeway, it pays TDI the remaining\n20 percent of the face value of the account receivable, less a\n3 percent finance fee. 9 This payment becomes part of the\ntrust corpus. Assuming Safeway paid on time, AgriCap\nwould pay $34 to TDI, for a total payment of $194 for the\nbenefit of the trust.\n\n    The Factoring Agreement provided AgriCap some\nprotections in exchange for taking the risk that the\nreceivables would not be collectible. Among other things,\nAgriCap could require TDI to repurchase accounts\nreceivable in certain circumstances, primarily if TDI had\nmade an error in calculating the amount of produce sold to\n\n    9\n       Under the terms of the Agreement, AgriCap’s fees were only\n1.5 percent, meaning that TDI would get 98.5 percent of the face value\nof each account receivable. In practice, AgriCap asserts that it paid TDI\non average 97 percent of the receivable’s value, and Palmer does not\ncontend otherwise. Earlier in this litigation, AgriCap stated that it paid\n98.2 percent on average. The district court did not make a finding on the\nactual amount paid, but estimated that it was “likely in the 90% range.”\n\f46     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nSafeway, and the Agreement required TDI to take back\naccounts receivable that were uncollectible after 90 days.\nHowever, AgriCap assumed the risk of loss in the event that\nSafeway became insolvent.\n\n     In sum, TDI received an 80 percent advance on the value\nof its accounts receivable and would receive up to 97 percent\nof their face value. Because PACA creates a nonsegregated\nfloating trust, TDI was statutorily authorized to use the\nmoney it received from AgriCap to pay all the growers,\nincluding Palmer, and with the 80 percent advance on each\naccount receivable, was able to do so with increased speed.\n\n    Although the Factoring Agreement states that TDI sold\nthe accounts receivable to AgriCap, it is possible, as the\nmajority suggests, to characterize the transaction as a loan.\nMaj. Op. at 12. If the arrangement is viewed as a loan, TDI,\nacting as a trustee, has borrowed $160 from AgriCap for the\nbenefit of all the growers (the beneficiaries), and assigned\nthe $200 Safeway account receivable to AgriCap as security\nfor the loan. A lender taking only a security interest in an\naccount receivable would typically not have any ability to\ncollect the account receivable (unless the borrower\ndefaulted). But the Factoring Agreement provides that once\nthe $200 account receivable is assigned to AgriCap, it is the\nsole entity authorized to collect it. Therefore, to maintain\nthe recharacterization of this transaction as a loan, we must\nview TDI as authorizing AgriCap to act as its collection\nagency, in addition to AgriCap’s role as secured lender. See\nNickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 603 (explaining, in the context\nof a similar agreement, that if the third party was “not a\npurchaser of the accounts receivable,” then it was “a lender\nand collection agent”). As TDI’s agent, AgriCap collects the\n$200 that Safeway owed TDI. Those funds are used to pay\nback the $160 loan to AgriCap, plus a $6 finance fee, leaving\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                    47\n\nan additional $34 for the benefit of the growers (thus\nobtaining a grand total of $194 cash from the sale of the four\nbushels of tomatoes to Safeway).\n\n    This relationship—however characterized—broke down\nin August 2008, when TDI failed to pay Palmer amounts\nowed for its produce. After Palmer sued TDI, the distributor\nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. In re Tanimura\nDistrib., Inc., No. 2:08-bk-22644-TD (Bankr. C.D. Cal.\nAug. 13, 2008), ECF No. 1.\n\n    When it declared bankruptcy, TDI owed Palmer roughly\n$845,000. 10 Absent PACA, Palmer would have been an\nunsecured creditor. Instead, the assets of the PACA trust\nwere available for distribution to Palmer, and TDI’s secured\ncreditors could not touch them. The administrator of TDI’s\nbankruptcy estate thus went about “identifying, recovering,\nand liquidating the PACA trust assets of [TDI] and\npreserving those funds for the benefit of all PACA trust\ncreditors.” Stipulation for Order Establishing PACA Trust\nClaims Procedure and Surcharge for Administrative\nExpenses at 11, In re Tanimura Distrib., Inc., No. 2:08-bk-\n22644-TD, (Bankr.

See\nChapter 7 Trustee’s Final Account, In re Tanimura Distrib., Inc., No.\n2:08-bk-22644-TD, (Bankr. C.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2014), ECF No. 262.\n\f48     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nreturn them to Palmer. In its motion for summary judgment,\nPalmer argued that TDI breached its fiduciary duty by\ngranting AgriCap a security interest in accounts receivable\nfrom the sale of Palmer’s produce and by transferring those\naccounts receivable to AgriCap. Further, Palmer claimed,\nAgriCap knew TDI was in breach of trust and is therefore\nliable to Palmer for the value of the accounts receivable that\nTDI transferred to AgriCap. In effect, Palmer’s summary\njudgment motion claims that because TDI did not pay\nPalmer the $160 it initially borrowed from AgriCap,\nAgriCap has to make good on TDI’s obligation.\n\n                              II\n\n    Under trust law, AgriCap’s potential liability primarily\nturns on whether the TDI breached its fiduciary duty. As\nexplained above, if TDI breached its fiduciary duty to\nPalmer and the growers by entering into the Factoring\nAgreement or by performing its obligations under the\nFactoring Agreement, and AgriCap was on notice of the\nbreach, AgriCap would hold any security interest in the trust\nassets or any proceeds derived from those assets, in a\nconstructive trust for the benefit of the growers.\n\n    Because a PACA trustee can give a lender a security\ninterest in trust assets, TDI did not breach its fiduciary duty\nto the growers merely by entering into the Factoring\nAgreement. The parties do not argue that the Factoring\nAgreement is commercially unreasonable; indeed, there\nwould be no basis for doing so. In our example, TDI as\ntrustee would get $194, or 97 percent of the $200 account\nreceivable. This far exceeds the 80 percent return that we\nhave approved in the sale of assets. See Boulder Fruit,\n251 F.3d at 1272 (“[A] factoring discount of 20% was never\nshown to be commercially unreasonable”). And, in the loan\nscenario, AgriCap is merely acting as a collection agent, and\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                  49\n\nit would not be commercially unreasonable for a creditor to\nagree that its collection agent can return accounts receivable\nthat are uncollectible. Moreover, if TDI takes back the $200\nuncollectible account receivable, TDI is no worse off than it\nwas before it authorized AgriCap to collect the account\nreceivable; TDI retains the asset, which has the same value\nbefore and after its transaction with AgriCap. After entering\ninto the Factoring Agreement, TDI as trustee was bound by\nits terms (assuming AgriCap did not breach the agreement).\nIf entering into the Factoring Agreement did not breach\nTDI’s fiduciary duties, then neither did complying with its\nterms. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 88 cmt. b\n(explaining that “if a trustee borrows funds from a third party\nfor use in the administration of the trust, the interest on the\nloan is payable (or reimbursable) from the trust estate,” so\nlong as the terms are “reasonable and the borrowing serves\nan appropriate trust purpose and is otherwise consistent with\nthe trustee’s fiduciary duties”); Austin W. Scott et. al., Scott\nand Ascher on Trusts § 26.2 (5th ed. 2007) (noting that the\ntrust estate remains liable for performing a contract entered\ninto by the trustee, even when the contract “is not in all\nrespects proper”). Indeed, no party argues that the Factoring\nAgreement is commercially unreasonable because it does\nnot include a term that would allow TDI to delay making\nrequired loan payments until after all growers who provide\nproduce to TDI have been fully paid. 12\n\n   In short, TDI did not breach its fiduciary duties as trustee\nwhen it entered into an agreement under which it received\nan 80 percent advance on each account receivable in\nexchange for repaying the advance plus a fee of 3 percent.\n\n    12\n       As indicated below, infra at p. 54, because PACA is a non-\nsegregated floating trust, such a term would likely prevent TDI from\nevery repaying a lender.\n\f50        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nNor did TDI breach its fiduciary duties by complying with\nthe terms of this agreement, which required TDI to repay the\nmoney borrowed from AgriCap. Therefore, AgriCap holds\nits interest in the accounts receivable and loan payments free\nof the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 283.\nUnder principles applicable to all trusts, including PACA\ntrusts, AgriCap has no liability to Palmer or any other\ngrower.\n\n                                  III\n\n    The majority agrees that basic trust principles apply to\nPACA trusts. Maj. Op. at 15. It also agrees that trust assets\nare excluded from the distributor’s bankruptcy estate if the\ndistributor goes bankrupt. Maj. Op. at 15. It agrees that if a\ntrustee “transfers trust property to a third person . . .\n[without] commit[ting] a breach of trust, the third person\nholds the interest so transferred or created free of the trust,\nand is under no liability to the beneficiary.” Maj. Op. at 16\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 283). Finally, the\nmajority agrees that a trustee can give a lender a security\ninterest in PACA trust assets without violating PACA. Maj.\nOp. at 32–33.\n\n    So how does the majority nonetheless reach the striking\nconclusion that if the Factoring Agreement is deemed to be\na loan transaction, then AgriCap, which paid TDI $194 for a\n$200 trust asset, is liable to Palmer for the same $200? 13 See\nMaj. Op. at 27–28. The majority reasons that under a loan\n\n     13\n        If described as a loan, this means that after TDI borrowed $194\nand subsequently repaid the $194 loan (plus fees) to AgriCap, AgriCap\nmust return the $194 plus fees to TDI, with no prospect of ever getting\nits loan repaid.\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                        51\n\nscenario, even if TDI did not breach its fiduciary duties by\nentering into a loan agreement, it breached them by\ncomplying with the terms of the loan agreement and repaying\nAgriCap’s loan. According to the majority’s analysis,\nbecause TDI repaid AgriCap’s loan before Palmer was paid\n(regardless whether TDI used AgriCap’s loan to pay other\ngrowers), AgriCap must make Palmer whole. 14 Maj. Op. at\n33. As explained below, this conclusion is not based in\nPACA or trust law, is contrary to our precedent, and cannot\nreasonably be applied to these transactions.\n\n    In reaching its conclusion that a trustee would breach its\nfiduciary duty by repaying the loan from trust assets “while\nthe trust beneficiaries have not been fully compensated,”\nMaj. Op. at 32, the majority relies on Nickey Gregory Co. v.\nAgriCap, LLC, which analyzed a similar agreement between\nAgriCap and a PACA trustee. See 597 F.3d at 596, 601–02.\nThe Fourth Circuit reasoned that the trustee’s arrangement\nwith AgriCap “authorized trust assets to be used to repay\nAgriCap ahead of the commodities sellers, who went\nunpaid,” and such an arrangement “breached the PACA\n\n    14\n        More precisely, the majority states that a trustee breaches its\nfiduciary duties “whenever the lender recovers its fee or percentage from\nthe accounts receivable while the trust beneficiaries have not been fully\ncompensated.” Maj. Op. at 32. It is not clear whether the majority deems\nthe breach to be limited to a trustee’s payment of interest to a lender, or\ndeems the trustee’s repayment of principal to the lender to also be a\nbreach of trust. Nor does the majority make clear whether a lender must\nreturn only the interest it received on the loan or must also return the\nrepayment of principal. Nevertheless, the majority’s adoption of this\nanalysis indicates that the majority assumes the lender must return both\ninterest and principal to the trustee. See Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at\n606–07 (rejecting AgriCap’s alternative argument that it should be\nrequired to disgorge only “the amount it received in interest and fees”\nand instead requiring it to disgorge all collections on receivables up to\nthe amount of growers’ claims).\n\f52     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\ntrust,” because the trustee “was obligated to ensure that trust\nassets remained freely available to pay PACA creditors\nfirst.” Id. at 604. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit concluded\nthat “AgriCap, as a third-party transferee of the trust assets,\nmust, under established trust principles, disgorge the\nproceeds of the receivables unless it has a defense.” Id.\n\n    The majority adopts this reasoning. While conceding\nthat this result has no basis in trust principles, Maj. Op. at\n31, the majority contends that this result is required by\nPACA, and quotes the regulation stating that PACA trustees\n“are required to maintain trust assets in a manner that such\nassets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations\nto sellers of perishable agricultural commodities,” and this\nprecludes a trustee from repaying a loan to the trust. Maj.\nOp. at 32 (quoting 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(d)(1)).\n\n     The majority’s analysis, like that in Nickey Gregory, is\ncritically flawed. First, the majority misunderstands the\nnature of trust assets. In the case of a loan, the trustee\nmaintains two assets available for the growers: the $194 that\nthe trustee received from the lender ($160 as an advance, $34\npost-collection), and the accounts receivable subject to the\nlender’s $160 lien. The trustee’s repayment of the $160 to\nthe lender does not dissipate the trust’s assets, because the\ntrust is not entitled to that $160 under the terms of the loan\nagreement. The typical produce sales arrangement seems\nmore questionable under the majority’s reasoning, because\nTDI relinquished the produce (an asset of the estate that is\nno longer freely available to the growers) to Safeway, and\nreceived only a promise to pay in return. Of course,\nCongress did not intend to preclude this sort of arrangement.\n\n    Second, the majority misunderstands the nature of a\ntrustee’s obligation in a loan agreement. Just like any trustee\nwho takes out a loan for the benefit of the beneficiaries and\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                        53\n\nuses trust assets as collateral, the PACA trustee must repay\nthe loan according to the terms of the loan agreement, and\nthe secured lender’s lien on those trust assets remains\nenforceable if the loan is not repaid. 15 Failure to pay the loan\naccording to its terms would constitute a breach of the\ntrustee’s fiduciary duties. See Scott et al., supra, § 17.8 (“A\ntrustee of property subject to a mortgage must take\nreasonable steps to prevent loss of the property by\nforeclosure.”). The majority cites nothing in PACA that\n\n    15\n       At oral argument, AgriCap’s counsel stated that the trust estate\nno longer contains any uncollected accounts receivable subject to a\nsecurity interest, and so such accounts receivable are not at issue in this\nappeal.

Corp.,\nYOUTUBE 28:30–28:50 (Sept. 20, 2017), https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=iikaXV7nkaw.\n\n      But were the issue before us, basic principles of trust law establish\nthat AgriCap would have the same rights with respect to those accounts\nreceivables as it would to the proceeds. If TDI, as trustee, did not breach\nits fiduciary duties when it borrowed money from AgriCap (or AgriCap\ndid not have knowledge of the breach), and the trustee still owed\nAgriCap money on the loan, then AgriCap would be entitled to foreclose\nits security interest on the accounts receivable according to the terms of\nthe loan agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 283–84, 288\n(explaining that a third-party lender holds its security interest in trust\nproperty free of the trust unless the grant of the interest was a breach of\nthe trustee’s fiduciary duty, the lender had notice, and the lender did not\ngive value).\n\n     While AgriCap’s counsel stated in response to questioning that a\nlender’s interest in the accounts receivable would be subordinate to the\ngrowers’ interests as beneficiaries, Maj. Op. at 33 n.11, we do not\nconstrue statutes based on passing statements at oral argument. Roberts\nv.

Because PACA is a non-\nsegregated floating trust, 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(b), each grower\nhas a claim on the trust assets, whether they were acquired\nbefore or after the grower sold its produce to the trustee. See\nIn re Kornblum & Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716603\"><a href=\"/opinion/716603/in-re-kornblum-co-inc-debtor-tom-lange-co-inc-and-scott-finks/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(holding that “a single PACA trust exists for the benefit of\nall of the sellers to a Produce Debtor, and continues in\nexistence until all of the outstanding beneficiaries have been\npaid in full.”). So long as the trustee continues to purchase\nproduce from growers on credit, there will be new growers\nwho have not yet been paid and therefore the trustee would\nbe precluded from repaying any lender from the trust assets.\nNo lender would enter into a loan agreement if the law\nprecluded repayment of the loan.\n\n    Perhaps realizing that there is no statutory basis for\nholding that a PACA trustee cannot repay a lender pursuant\nto the terms of the loan agreement, the majority posits that if\na PACA trustee borrows from a lender, and secures the loan\nwith an interest in trust property, the beneficiaries have a\npriority lien on the trust property over all other lenders. Maj.\nOp. at 27–28. The majority analogizes to circumstances\nwhere state law protects a creditor by giving that creditor a\npriority lien over all other creditors. Maj. Op. at 27–31.\n\n    This framework, however, is divorced from the language\nof PACA and basic principles of trust law. Congress could\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                          55\n\nwell have provided that when a distributor purchases a\ngrower’s produce on credit, the grower would be deemed, by\noperation of law, to have a lien on that produce (and its\nproceeds) that has priority over the liens of all other\ncreditors. But, there is nothing to this effect in PACA.\nRather, Congress elected to rely on a trust mechanism, and\nto protect growers by making the distributor a trustee\nholding their proceeds in trust. See 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2).\nA beneficiary of a trust does not have any lien on trust assets,\nlet alone a priority lien. 16\n\n    Although the majority purports to follow the lead of\nthree other circuits, only the Fourth Circuit has adopted the\ntheory that a trustee’s loan repayments in the ordinary course\nof business are a breach of trust.

If the Factoring\nAgreement is in fact a loan agreement, then AgriCap loaned\nTDI between $19,057,000 and $20,425,000 for many\ndifferent accounts receivable, and TDI ultimately paid back\n(through AgriCap’s collections on the accounts receivable)\nsome amount up to the loan amount plus a finance fee for\neach of those accounts receivable. 19 Although the majority\nindicates that AgriCap is liable to Palmer for some portion\nof the money AgriCap received in repayment of its $19–20\nmillion in loans, the majority gives no direction to the district\ncourt on how to determine the extent to which AgriCap is\nliable. To the extent the majority’s reasoning would require\nAgriCap to repay principal and interest on its loan, the\nmajority effectively makes the factor the trustee’s guarantor,\nwho must make the beneficiaries whole if the trustee does\nnot do so. But it is already settled that “third parties are not\nguarantors of the PACA trust.” Boulder Fruit, 251 F.3d at\n1272; Consumers Produce Co. v.

But\nthe majority offers no principled distinction for why a trustee\ncan sell produce for cash, sell an account receivable for cash,\nbut not borrow cash secured by the produce or account\nreceivable, even though the trustee gets substantially the\n\n   19\n      The parties dispute the amounts AgriCap loaned to TDI and the\namounts that TDI repaid AgriCap.\n\f58     G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nsame amount of cash for the benefit of the growers in each\ntransaction. More fundamentally, the majority’s discussion\nof PACA’s purpose seems to conflate lenders-to-the-\ndistributor with lenders-to-the-trustee. Lenders to the\ndistributor cannot reach PACA assets in bankruptcy because\nTDI holds those assets in trust for the growers. See Sunkist\nGrowers, 104 F.3d at 282. But when we deal with secured\nlenders to the trust, the loan advance and subsequent\npayments become trust property, and it is fully consistent\nwith PACA’s purpose to look at whether the trust got a fair\n(i.e., commercially reasonable) deal.\n\n     Once we discard the majority’s theory of breach, its\ndiscussion of the test for a “true sale” becomes irrelevant.\nMaj. Op. at 26–27. In the trust context, the key question is\nnot whether the trustee is engaged in a sale or loan, but\nwhether the trustee breached its fiduciary duty in entering\ninto the loan agreement (and complying with it according to\nits terms). The answer to that question turns primarily on the\ncommercial reasonableness of the individual transaction and\nits terms.\n\n                             IV\n\n    By enacting PACA, Congress provided significant\nprotection to growers by ensuring that a distributor who buys\ntheir produce on credit owes the growers a fiduciary duty to\nmanage the trust assets (the produce and its proceeds) for\ntheir benefit. Contrary to the majority’s assertion, this\nprotection does not entitle growers to disregard obligations\nundertaken by the trustee on their behalf. If the trustee\nborrows money for the benefit of the beneficiaries in a\ncommercially reasonable transaction, the lender is entitled to\nbe paid back from trust assets. Under trust principles and\nPACA, there is an exception to this rule only if the trustee\nbreached its fiduciary duties when it entered into the loan\n\f        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL               59\n\narrangement, and the lender was on notice of this breach. In\nthis context, there is no need to distinguish between “true\nsales” and “loans.” In other words, we had it right in Boulder\nFruit: we look at the commercial reasonableness of the\nagreement to determine whether it was a breach of trust,\nregardless whether the agreement is a sale or a loan.\nRecourse provisions and other features that “transfer risk”\nmay be relevant to this analysis. But unless the transaction\nis commercially unreasonable or otherwise a breach of the\ntrustee’s fiduciary duty, there is no basis under PACA or\ntrust law for depriving the lender of its right to repayment\nunder the loan agreement or, as in this case, requiring a\nlender that has loaned money to the trust and been repaid by\nthe borrower to return the borrower’s repayment.\n\n      The majority’s approach is inconsistent with PACA, and\nthat should be enough to reject it. “[W]e will not presume\nwith [appellants] that any result consistent with their account\nof the statute's overarching goal must be the law but will\npresume more modestly instead ‘that [the] legislature says\n. . . what it means and means . . . what it says.’” Henson v.\nSantander Consumer USA Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1718</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1725 (2017)\n(third, fourth, and fifth alterations in original) (quoting Dodd\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799979\"><a href=\"/opinion/799979/dodd-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 (2005)).\n\n    But the majority’s approach also makes no sense as a\npractical matter. Under the majority’s decision, a transaction\nin which the trustee made a commercially reasonable sale of\na $200 account receivable to AgriCap and received $150 in\nreturn would not constitute a dissipation of trust assets, and\nAgriCap could keep the $200 it collected on the account\nreceivable from the retailer. But a transaction in which the\ntrustee received a $200 loan from AgriCap (secured by a\nsecurity interest in the same $200 account receivable) and\nagreed to pay back the loan when it collected the $200 from\n\f60        G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL\n\nthe retailer, would constitute a dissipation of assets if the\ntrustee paid back the loan. 20 By imposing these drastically\ndivergent outcomes based on the loan-sale distinction, the\nmajority fails to heed its own advice that “courts must focus\non the true substance of PACA-related transactions and not\non artificial indicators or labels.” Maj. Op. at 25.\n\n    Moreover, the majority’s approach will hurt PACA\nbeneficiaries in the long run. If lenders face the prospect that\nany repayments they receive will be a breach of trust and\nsubject to disgorgement, they will either refuse to engage in\nfactoring transactions or impose more severe terms to\naccount for the heightened risk. 21\n\n\n    20\n        As explained above, supra p. 54, the distributor-trustees\nconstantly generate new outstanding obligations to growers in the\nordinary course of business, meaning that in practical terms, any\nrepayment could be a breach under the majority’s theory.\n\n     21\n       “[I]n desperation,” the majority attempts to distract attention from\nthe necessary implications of its own logic by pointing to policy issues,\npassing statements in oral argument, and its reliance on the Fourth\nCircuit’s similar errors. Maj. Op. at 33 n.11. Instead of reasoning and\nanalysis, the majority offers only conclusory statements. For instance,\nthe majority states “nowhere do we suggest that trusts are free to\ndisregard their obligations to lenders.” But this is contrary to the\nmajority’s own reasoning, that “whenever a loan is made, a PACA\ntrustee must be careful to ensure all trust beneficiaries are paid before\nthe lender collects.” Maj. Op. at 33. Said otherwise, a trustee cannot\nrepay the lender according to the terms of the loan. Or at all—as\nexplained above, supra p. 54, given the nature of a floating, non-\nsegregated trust, some trust beneficiaries will be unpaid at any given\ntime.\n\n    Similarly, the majority argues we should not consider the\nconsequences of its theory of breach, because it remands to the district\ncourt for a determination of damages. Maj. Op. at 33 n.11. But it\n\f         G.W. PALMER & CO. V. AGRICAP FINANCIAL                          61\n\n    I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\nrequires no “interested speculation and conjecture” to conclude that, if\nthe Factoring Agreement is deemed to be a loan, AgriCap would have to\nreturn all loan payments it received, up to the value of TDI’s debts to\nPalmer. See Nickey Gregory, 597 F.3d at 607 n.2 (“As we have noted,\nbecause the accounts receivable and their proceeds were trust assets, the\nunpaid commodities sellers have a prior interest in them and can recover\nfrom AgriCap to the full satisfaction of their debts up to the limit of trust\nassets held while they remained unpaid.”).\n\f</pre>",
