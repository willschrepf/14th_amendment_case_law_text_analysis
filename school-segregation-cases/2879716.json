Assuming he receives all good conduct time available to him under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3624(b), his projected release date is July 10, 2014. In May 2002, David was\n\ncharged with a misconduct for threatening a food service officer with bodily harm, a\n\nviolation of Code 203.1 David asserts that he was given an ice cream sandwich by one\n\nfood service officer, and it quickly was taken from him by a different food service officer\n\nbecause he was not supposed to have it. David explained to the second food service\n\nofficer that he was rightfully in possession of the item, at which point the second officer\n\nexpressed surprise that David was “snitching” on the first officer. David evidently took\n\noffense at being called a “snitch” in front of other inmates and committed the complained\n\nof conduct, which included raising his voice and his fists.\n\n       David received a disciplinary hearing and was adjudicated guilty. The\n\nDisciplinary Hearing Officer (“DHO”) imposed the following sanctions: 30 days\n\ndisciplinary segregation, 27 days loss of good conduct time and a recommendation\n\n(suspended pending 180 days clear conduct) for a disciplinary transfer. David appealed\n\nthe DHO’s decision to the Bureau of Prisons Northeast Regional Office, but the appeal\n\nwas rejected as untimely. He appealed the decision of the Regional Office to the Central\n\nOffice, unsuccessfully.\n\n       David filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in\n\n\n  1\n    A chart listing the various code offenses or prohibited acts within the Bureau of\nPrisons inmate disciplinary system and describing the available sanctions is found at\nTable 3 of 28 C.F.R. § 541.13. Sanctions are also addressed in Tables 4 and 5 of 28\nC.F.R. § 541.13.\n                                             2\n\fUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, in which he contended that he\n\ndid not have an adequate opportunity to prepare his defense because he did not meet with\n\nhis staff representative until the hearing, his staff representative was not impartial, the\n\nstaff representative failed to produce witnesses to testify on his behalf, the disciplinary\n\naction was a sham to cover up the food service officer’s misconduct in calling him a\n\nsnitch, and the evidence did not support the DHO’s finding because the food service\n\nofficer’s statement contained contradictions. The government answered the complaint on\n\nthe merits and waived the procedural default defense available under Moscato v. Federal\n\nBureau of Prisons, 98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n       In an order entered on August 19, 2005, the District Court denied the habeas\n\npetition. As a threshold matter, the court construed David’s assertions as a proper\n\nchallenge to the constitutional adequacy of his disciplinary procedures at FCI Fort Dix,\n\nwhich resulted in loss of good time credits and a resulting effect on the execution of his\n\nsentence. The procedural due process protections afforded by Wolff v. McDonnell, 418\n\nU.S. 539 (1974), apply only when a prisoner’s constitutional interests are implicated.\n\nSandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472, 487 (1995). With respect to his disciplinary\n\nconfinement, David lacked the requisite constitutional interest, because it was not an\n\n“atypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\nGriffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484).\n\n       With respect to loss of good time credit, the District Court concluded that David\n\nwas entitled to: (1) an impartial decision-making body; (2) twenty-four hour advance\n\n                                               3\n\fwritten notice of the charges; (3) an opportunity to call witnesses and present\n\ndocumentary evidence; (4) assistance from a representative; and a written decision\n\nexplaining the evidence relied upon. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67. In addition, the decision\n\nhad to have support, but only by “some” evidence in the record. Superintendent v. Hill,\n\n472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985). Applying these principles, the court concluded that David was\n\nafforded due process. He received written notice well before the disciplinary hearing, he\n\nwas advised of his rights and he requested a staff representative, and Counselor J.\n\nWilliams represented him, and he provided a statement in his own behalf. The DHO also\n\nconsidered evidence from the two food service officers. A written decision was issued in\n\nwhich the DHO explained that David’s testimony was self-serving and that the act of\n\nthreatening another was committed as charged. Moreover, David had not substantiated\n\nhis charge that the process was not impartial.\n\n       We will affirm. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a).\n\nIn reviewing a federal habeas judgment, we exercise plenary review over a district court's\n\nlegal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. See Rios\n\nv. Wiley, 201 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir. 2000). Although the issue in David’s appeal\n\ncontains some elements of a factual nature, the inquiry is essentially legal in nature, and\n\nwe therefore exercise plenary review over the District Court's conclusions regarding this\n\nmatter. Id.\n\n       We have carefully reviewed the record and David’s contentions on appeal. We\n\nagree with the District Court, for the reasons given, that he received notice, an adequate\n\n                                              4\n\fopportunity to present his case, adequate assistance from a staff member, and a written\n\ndecision. We agree that he did not substantiate his charge of an impartial tribunal. Wolff,\n\n418 U.S. at 563-572. In addition, there was some evidence to support the DHO’s\n\nconclusions, including David’s admissions, and the eyewitness accounts. Id. at 564-65;\n\nHill, 472 U.S. at 455-56.2 David has argued on appeal that the evidence was disputed, but\n\nthe Hill standard is minimal and does not require an independent assessment of the\n\ncredibility of witnesses or even a weighing of the evidence. Thompson v. Owens, 889\n\nF.2d 500, 502 (3d Cir. 1989). Therefore, the District Court properly rejected David’s due\n\nprocess claim on the merits.\n\n       We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n  2\n     In denying David’s appeal, the Warden explained that the threatening behavior was\nnot justified even assuming that the snitch remark was made, and we agree.\n                                            5\n\f",

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a).\n\nIn reviewing a federal habeas judgment, we exercise plenary review over a district court's\n\nlegal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. See Rios\n\nv. Wiley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767355\"><a href=\"/opinion/767355/francisco-rios-v-ron-wiley-warden-fpc-allenwood-ron-wiley/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 262 (3d Cir. 2000). Although the issue in David’s appeal\n\ncontains some elements of a factual nature, the inquiry is essentially legal in nature, and\n\nwe therefore exercise plenary review over the District Court's conclusions regarding this\n\nmatter. Id.\n\n       We have carefully reviewed the record and David’s contentions on appeal. We\n\nagree with the District Court, for the reasons given, that he received notice, an adequate\n\n                                              4\n\fopportunity to present his case, adequate assistance from a staff member, and a written\n\ndecision. We agree that he did not substantiate his charge of an impartial tribunal. Wolff,\n\n418 U.S. at 563-572. In addition, there was some evidence to support the DHO’s\n\nconclusions, including David’s admissions, and the eyewitness accounts. Id. at 564-65;\n\nHill, 472 U.S. at 455-56.2 David has argued on appeal that the evidence was disputed, but\n\nthe Hill standard is minimal and does not require an independent assessment of the\n\ncredibility of witnesses or even a weighing of the evidence. Thompson v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532052\"><a href=\"/opinion/532052/david-thompson-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (3d Cir. 1989). Therefore, the District Court properly rejected David’s due\n\nprocess claim on the merits.\n\n       We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n  2\n     In denying David’s appeal, the Warden explained that the threatening behavior was\nnot justified even assuming that the snitch remark was made, and we agree.\n                                            5\n\f</pre>",
