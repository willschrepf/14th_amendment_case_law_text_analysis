The Court assessed punishment at 50 years in\n\nTexas Department of Corrections Count I, and 20 years in the Texas Department of\n\nCorrections Counts III, IV, V, and VI.

When the victim and the individual reporting the alleged crime to CPS are\n\n     known to all parties does Texas Family Code 261.201 as it relates to the\n\n     Texas Code Criminal Procedure 39.14 require strict compliance. The\n\n     legislature has created an unworkable procedure that denies an accused\n\n     access to CPS records for cross examination and the preparation of a\n\n     defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\fTO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:\n\n      COMES NOW, RONALD BLAKE FEARS, Petitioner in the above\n\nentitled and numbered cause, by and through his attorney of record Douglas H.\n\nPettit and files this Petition for Discretionary Review and, in support of which,\n\nwould respectfully show this Honorable Court the following:\n\n                       QUESTION PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n\n      When the victim and the individual reporting the alleged crime to CPS are\n      known to all parties, does Texas Family Code 261.201 as it relates to the\n      Texas Code Criminal Procedure 39.14 require strict compliance. The\n      Legislature has created an unworkable procedure that denies an accused\n      access to CPS records for cross examination and the preparation of a\n      defense.\n\n                       ARGUMENT or REASON FOR REVIEW\n\n      The issue concerns CPS records and the trial court and district attorney‟s\n\noffice failure to turn those records over to trial counsel. The State‟s position was\n\nthe records were not discoverable under Texas Family Code 261.201. (R.R. Vol 4\n\np. 187) (R.R. Vol 4 p. 261) (R.R.Vol 5 p. 138) This is conflict with the procedure\n\nset out in Texas Code Criminal Procedure 39.14. District Attorney's continue to\n\nrely on Texas Family Code 261.201 to deny an accused access to CPS records\n\nwhen the victim is known and the person reporting the alleged crime to CPS is\n\nknown.\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                       ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n      The individual who reported the alleged crime to CPS was also the \"outcry\n\nwitness\" in this case. (R.R. Vol 3 p 78) (R.R. Vol 3 p. 92). The victim of the\n\nalleged abuse was the step daughter of the Petitioner. (R.R. Vol 3. p. 73) Trial\n\nCounsel was not permitted to review the CPS records prior to trial or during cross\n\nexamination of the CPS worker. (R.R Vol. 4 p. 190) (R.R. Vol 4 p. 260) It is\n\nfurther alleged that two audio statements taken by CPS of the victim and her sister\n\nwere not turned over prior to the trial.\n\n      Reading Texas Code of Procedure 39.14 it expressly refers to Texas\n\nFamily Code 264.408, which refers to Texas Family Code 261.201. Texas Code\n\nCriminal Procedure 39.14 indicates that subject to the restrictions listed in\n\n264.408 the information should be turned over. Texas Family Code 264.408\n\napplies to public release of information under Chapter 552, public records\n\nrequests and lists that the video tapes should not be copied, not disclosure denied.\n\nThus the courts must look back to the Texas Family Code 261.201.\n\n      The Thirteenth Court of Appeal upheld the trial court‟s ruling holding the\n\nPetitioner was not entitled to view CPS records which contained the investigators\n\nreport and oral tape recorded statements of victim and her sister pursuant to Texas\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fFamily Code 261.201.2\n\n       Petitioner‟s attorney first request for the records came after direct\n\nexamination and prior to cross examination of the CPS worker. (R.R. Vol 4 p.190)\n\nThe request was made under Texas Rules of Evidence 615 in order to conduct\n\ncross examination of the investigating officer. The records were turned over to the\n\ncourt after cross examination. (R.R. Vol 4 p. 264) The Trial Court provided a\n\nlimited amount of the material for counsel after his examination was concluded.\n\n       During the direct examination of the child victim it was learned that\n\nadditional information contained within the CPS records had not been given to the\n\nPetitioner's trial attorney. The child victim had been interviewed by CPS worker\n\nand the interview had been audio recorded. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 136) Prior to the cross\n\nexamination of child victim by the defendant‟s trial counsel requested that he be\n\nallowed to listen to the audio tape. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 138). The Trial Court first\n\ninquired whether the Defendant‟s attorney had previously had an opportunity to\n\nlisten to the tape. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 138) and the State of Texas responded that “they\n\nwere not allowed to disclose CPS recordings. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 138) The Court\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The record submitted to the 13th Court of Appeals also contains CPS records in the possession\nof the Assistant District Attorney and these documents have not been reviewed by trial counsel\nor appellant counsel but were ordered sealed by the trial court.\n\n                                              10\n\fordered that those be turned over to trial counsel prior to the cross examination of\n\nthe victim. (R.R. Vol 5 p 138)\n\n      Petitioner‟s attorney requested three continuances from the Court during the\n\ntrial to prepare for cross examination of witnesses and review the CPS records. All\n\nrequests were denied.\n\n      The Court of Appeals in their opinion stated that “the conflict that can arise\n\nbetween the State‟s need to keep information related to child abuse investigations\n\nconfidential with a defendant‟s need for a fair trial is well recognized” citing\n\nPennsylvania vs. Richie 480 U.S. 39, 59, (1987). The Thirteenth Court of Appeals\n\nused the example regarding the Crime Stoppers information as stated in Thomas v.\n\nState 837 S.W. 2d. 106,113-114 (Tex Crim. App. 1992) The Court of Appeals also\n\nstated that Texas Family Code section 262.201 provides for exactly the type of\n\nprocedure approved in Ritchie and Thomas. . This requires an in camera\n\ninspection of the material by the trial judge; and an ongoing duty to disclose any\n\nconfidential material that is relevant; or that becomes relevant during the trial.\n\n      The process set up in Tex. Family Code 261.201 for obtaining CPS records\n\nfor an accused is unworkable as it relates to criminal prosecution. The Court‟s\n\nopinion is out of touch with the reality of trial work. It infringes on the Defendant‟s\n\nright to confront and cross examine a witness as guaranteed by the 6th and 14th\n\n                                          11\n\famendment to the United States Constitution and Article I section 10 of the\n\nTexas Constitution.\n\n      The procedure is unworkable for two reasons. First it places the emphasis\n\non the district judge to review and decipher the information. Second it also\n\ndemands that the District Attorney actually turn over all the CPS documents to the\n\ntrial court for review.\n\n      The Federal standard requiring only an in camera review by the trial judge of\n\nprivileged records requested by the defendant rests on the assumptions that trial\n\njudges can temporarily and effectively assume the role of advocate when\n\nexamining such records; and that the interests of the State and complainant in the\n\nconfidentiality of the records cannot adequately be protected in any other way.\n\nNeither assumption withstands close scrutiny.\n\n      As to the first assumption, the United States Supreme Court has said that “\n\n„it [is] extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under\n\nthe pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the [information] that would be\n\nuseful in impeaching a witness.‟ ... Nor is it realistic to assume that the trial court's\n\njudgment as to the utility of material for impeachment ... would exhaust the\n\npossibilities. In our adversary system, it is enough for judges to judge. The\n\ndetermination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be\n\n                                           12\n\fmade only by an advocate.” Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 874–875, 86\n\nS.Ct. 1840, 1851, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966 The danger lurking in the practice of ... in\n\ncamera review [of privileged documents] by the trial judge is a confusion between\n\nthe roles of trial judge and defense counsel. The judge is not necessarily in the best\n\nposition to know what is necessary to the defense.” Commonwealth v. Clancy,\n\n524 N.E.2d 395. Commonwealth v. Liebman, 388 Mass. 483, 489, 446 N.E.2d\n\n714 (1983) (“[W]hen a judge undertakes to decide if [evidence] benefits the\n\ndefendant's case he is „assuming vicariously and uncomfortably the role of\n\ncounsel‟. Commonwealth v. Stockhammer, 409 Mass 867, 570 N.E. 2d, 992\n\n(1991)\n\n      In the present case the records were on CD‟s. The trial judge had to have\n\nactually reviewed each disk and know which evidence was to be released. When\n\nThe District Attorney in the Appellant‟s case provided the disks to the Court she\n\nleft one out. This last disk was not turned over until right before the victim\n\ntestified.(R.R. Vol 6 p.6)\n\n      The prosecutor consistently though out the trial and on appeal has relied on\n\nTexas Family Code 261.201. She stated on numerous occasions that the\n\ndocuments should not be turned over to the Defendant that the documents were\n\nprotected. The record is clear that the CPS records were contained within the\n\n                                         13\n\fDistrict Attorney‟s file but trial counsel was not allowed to view them. It is further\n\nalleged that the records were sealed and filed in the records of this cause. It is\n\nunknown whether anyone else has ever viewed them.\n\n      In reading the Texas Family Code 261.201 the law was set up to protect the\n\nvictim and the person who was making the report to CPS. It makes no sense to\n\ndeny the records when those facts are known to all parties.\n\n       In a sexual assault trial the child or victim is known to all parties, and the\n\noutcry individual in this case was the person that called CPS. The law is being used\n\nby the State of Texas to deny the individual charged with sexual offenses from\n\naccess to records that may assist in his defense. To allow the State to hide behind\n\nthis statute is not only incorrect but goes against everything that the new discovery\n\nrules are trying to change.\n\n      The rights of defendants charged with sexual offenses in the State of Texas\n\nhas diminished rightfully or wrongfully based on the heinous nature of the crime.\n\nThe legislature has first created a specific crime of continuous sexual assault that\n\ncarries a minimum punishment 25 years in the penitentiary. The law further\n\ndecrees that the heinous nature of the crime requires that those convicted are not\n\nentitled to parole.\n\n      District attorney‟s offices have created special units to prosecute these types\n\n                                          14\n\fof offenses. We must and should protect our children from predators. But in doing\n\nso we also must do so without tromping on the right to a fair and impartial trial.\n\n         When the child is known and the individual making the report is known by\n\nall parties and the records are in the possession of the district attorney what is the\n\npurpose of hiding the documents? Allowing the District Attorney to rely on Texas\n\nFamily Code 261.201 when the victim is known and the individual reporting to\n\nCPS is known it is not logical or productive for the efficient administration of\n\njustice.\n\n         Allegedly all of the CPS documents in Petitioners case have been filed with\n\nthe Court of Appeals. It is unknown if anything in the documents would have been\n\nof use to the Petitioner at trial. The only individuals that have viewed them are the\n\ntrial court, appellate court, CPS personnel, and the district attorney. It should be the\n\ndefendant and his trial counsel who make the determination that the records may or\n\nmay not be of any use to him during the trial not the district attorney and the trial\n\njudge.\n\n         Petitioner is requesting that the Honorable Court of Criminal Appeals allow\n\nthis points of review regarding Texas Family Code 261.201 as it relates to Tex.\n\nCrim. Proc. 39.14. and Texas Family Code 264.408. The issue is not one of how\n\nwas the Petitioner harmed it is one of fundamental fairness. It is the right to cross\n\n                                          15\n\fexamining a witness and the ability to prepare to cross examine the witness in a\n\ntimely and effective manner. It is the right to review of the documents that the\n\nState of Texas intends to use to convict the Petitioner.\n\n                             PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n      WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, appellant prays this\n\nHonorable Court to consider the ground for review raised herein to grant this\n\npetition for discretionary review, and to order a full and complete hearing on the\n\nmerits with briefs.\n\n\n\n                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               /S/Douglas H.

See TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. §§ 21.02, 22.011(a)(2), 21.11(a)(1) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n          A. Initial Statements\n\n          During the weekend of October 2, 2011, C.T.,2 the minor complainant in this case,\n\nwas sleeping over at the home of her friend Chesney St. John (Chesney) and helping to\n\nbabysit Chesney’s younger siblings. At the time, Chesney was sixteen years old and C.T.\n\nwas fourteen years old.3               C.T. confided to Chesney that C.T. needed help telling\n\nsomething to C.T.’s mother, which C.T. evidently found difficult to discuss. Chesney\n\ntestified that C.T. typed a message into the text message function of her phone, showed\n\nChesney what she wished to tell her mother, and then erased it. According to Chesney,\n\nthe message revealed that C.T. was being sexually abused by appellant, her stepfather.\n\nChesney further testified that she learned that the abuse began when C.T. was eight\n\nyears old.         Chesney called her parents, who returned to the house.                      Chesney first\n\nrepeated some of C.T.’s statements to Chesney’s parents because C.T. was crying too\n\nmuch to speak.\n\n          Chesney’s mother, Natalie, questioned C.T. after Chesney finished speaking and\n\ntestified to C.T.’s responses at trial.4 Natalie testified that C.T. stated that appellant forced\n\n\n          1   The State abandoned Count II, aggravated sexual assault of a child, after the close of its case.\n          2C.T. testified under this pseudonym in the trial court. We will continue to refer to her by it in an\neffort to protect her privacy.\n\n          3   Chesney was eighteen years old at the time of the trial.\n          4The trial court certified Natalie as the outcry witness under article 38.072 because she was the\nfirst person older than eighteen years to whom C.T. made a statement about the abuse. See TEX. CODE\n\n                                                         2\n\fher to perform oral sex on him and appellant performed oral sex on C.T. The most recent\n\nabuse occurred one week earlier. C.T. told her that the abuse occurred in her parents’\n\nbedroom on multiple occasions, and on one occasion, appellant attempted to vaginally\n\npenetrate her as she lay naked on the bed but stopped after she curled into a fetal position\n\nand began to cry. Natalie called the San Benito Police Department; she and Chesney\n\naccompanied C.T. to the police station and waited while C.T. gave a statement to Officer\n\nCarlos Andrade.\n\n         B. C.T.’s Statement to Officer Andrade\n\n         Officer Andrade testified that he learned from his interview with C.T. that appellant\n\n“was only touching [C.T.’s] private areas” and that he had not penetrated her with his\n\nfingers or forced her to perform oral sex. However, Officer Andrade further testified that\n\nhe did not determine before conducting the interview whether C.T. understood the terms\n\n“penetration” and “oral sex.” Chesney testified that C.T. did not know the meaning of the\n\nterm “oral sex” until she and C.T. spoke after C.T. gave a statement to Andrade. Chesney\n\ntestified that after explaining the term, she believed that appellant had forced C.T. to\n\nperform oral sex. Andrade also testified that C.T. confirmed that the abuse began when\n\nshe was eight years old. Andrade testified that he felt that there was enough evidence to\n\ndetermine that a crime had been committed and contacted Child Protective Services\n\n(CPS).\n\n         C. Interview with Francisco Lopez\n\n         CPS Investigator Francisco Lopez testified on direct examination that he was\n\nassigned to the case after CPS received reports from Chesney and Natalie and the San\n\n\n\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.072, § 2(a)(3) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.).\n\n                                                   3\n\fBenito Police. On Sunday, October 3, 2011 (the day after C.T. first spoke to Chesney),\n\nLopez and another CPS investigator went to Chesney and Natalie’s home to interview\n\nC.T. Lopez testified that they would normally bring a child complainant for a forensic\n\ninterview at Maggie’s House, the Children’s Advocacy Center, but it was closed that day.\n\nLopez personally interviewed C.T. and made an audio recording of the interview, which\n\nwe will refer to as the “Lopez Recording.”\n\n       During the interview, C.T. confirmed that the abuse started when she was eight\n\nyears old, that she had recently learned the meaning of the term “oral sex” from Chesney,\n\nthat appellant had forced her to perform oral sex, and that appellant had performed oral\n\nsex on her. C.T. clarified to Lopez that she told Officer Andrade that he did not force her\n\nto perform oral sex because she did not know the meaning of the term until she spoke to\n\nChesney after giving the statement. C.T. also described the specific appearance of\n\nappellant’s genitalia, including whether his pubic hair was shaved or unshaved, that he\n\nhad pimples on his thighs, and that she sometimes saw “red dots” on his genital area.\n\nLopez questioned C.T.’s mother when she arrived to pick up C.T. and testified that C.T.’s\n\nmother gave a similar description of appellant’s genitalia.\n\n       Immediately prior to Lopez’s testimony, appellant’s counsel orally moved for a\n\ncontinuance to review any documents prepared by Lopez during his investigation\n\nbecause the documents “could be pretty voluminous.” The trial court overruled the motion\n\nas premature. At the beginning of cross-examination by appellant’s counsel, Lopez\n\nconfirmed that he had prepared an eight-page report of his investigation, that he used a\n\ncopy of the report to refresh his memory prior to testifying, and that he had not provided\n\nthe report to the State, the trial court, or appellant because it was confidential by law. See\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 261.201 (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). Appellant’s\n\ncounsel moved under Texas Rule of Evidence 615 that the court order Lopez to turn over\n\nthe report and orally moved for a continuance to give him time to review the report before\n\nusing it to cross-examine Lopez. See TEX. R. EVID. 615. The trial judge denied both\n\nmotions. At the end of Lopez’s testimony, appellant’s counsel again requested the report.\n\nAppellant’s counsel also filed a written motion for continuance and a motion for disclosure\n\nof confidential records. The trial judge never explicitly ruled on the motions but carried\n\nthem through the trial. The trial judge also ordered the State to tender the CPS files\n\ngenerated in the case to the court under seal. After reviewing the records in camera, the\n\ntrial judge disclosed a copy of Lopez’s eight-page report to the defense and read two\n\nadditional pages into the record.\n\n       D. Lopez’s Interview with B.F.\n\n       Lopez briefly interviewed B.F., C.T.’s younger sister, on the same day as his\n\noriginal interview with C.T. Lopez also made an audio recording of that interview. At trial,\n\nthe State called B.F. as a witness. During the State’s direct examination, B.F. denied that\n\nshe had ever told Lopez that appellant and C.T. were alone “many times” in her parents’\n\nroom with the door closed. The State offered into evidence a portion of the audio\n\nrecording of Lopez’s interview with B.F. that was inconsistent with this testimony. See\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 613. The trial court judge admitted that portion of the statement into\n\nevidence over appellant’s objections. At the end of the State’s examination, B.F. admitted\n\nthat her mother had told her what to say during her trial testimony.\n\n       E. C.T.’s Interview at Maggie’s House\n\n       The day after the initial interviews, Lopez took C.T. for a forensic interview at\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fMaggie’s House. Lopez described C.T.’s interview, which we discuss in detail below, as\n\ncontaining more details, but consistent with C.T.’s prior statements.         Following the\n\ninterview, Detective Manuel Cisneros decided to file charges against appellant.\n\n       F. C.T.’s Testimony\n\n       C.T. testified on direct examination that the first incident of abuse occurred when\n\nshe was eight years old and appellant touched the surface of her vagina with his fingers.\n\nShe remembered at least one other incident of appellant doing similar acts around the\n\nsame time period. C.T. testified that the abuse escalated in “stages.” On subsequent\n\noccasions, appellant would “play with my nipples or my boobs. He’d suck on them or he’d\n\nput his mouth to my vagina.” C.T. further testified that appellant also forced her to perform\n\noral sex on him more than ten times. She testified that appellant actually tried to insert\n\nhis penis into her vagina on two occasions, in contrast to the single incident that she\n\ndescribed to Natalie, Chesney, Officer Andrade, Lopez, and the interviewer at Maggie’s\n\nHouse. C.T. explained that at the time of her initial outcry, her “nerves were running very\n\nthin, and like, I was not thinking fully.”\n\n       C.T. mentioned during direct examination that she gave a statement to Lopez prior\n\nto the interview at Maggie’s House. At the end of the State’s direct examination, appellant\n\nobjected and requested that the court disclose any statements C.T. gave to CPS. After\n\nan in camera review of the sealed CPS files, the trial judge disclosed the existence of two\n\naudio files of C.T.’s interview with Lopez to all parties. The trial judge denied appellant’s\n\nmotion for continuance but gave appellant’s counsel time to listen to the recordings before\n\nproceeding with the trial.5 The State moved on redirect to introduce a portion of the video\n\n\n\n       5   The audio files run approximately twenty-five minutes in total.\n\n                                                      6\n\frecording of C.T.’s interview at Maggie’s House. The State argued that it was admissible\n\nto counteract a false impression of C.T.’s tendency to lie that was left in the jurors’ minds\n\nby counsel’s cross-examination. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(e)(1)(c). The trial court admitted\n\nthat portion of the video over appellant’s objections.\n\n       G. Verdict and Sentence\n\n       Following the close of evidence, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all pending\n\ncounts. Appellant opted for the trial judge to assess his punishment. The trial judge\n\nassessed concurrent sentences of fifty years’ imprisonment on Count I and twenty years’\n\nimprisonment on each of the remaining counts. Appellant filed a motion for new trial, and\n\nthe trial court denied it by written order. Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                                 II. MOTIONS FOR CONTINUANCE\n\n       By his first issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his three\n\nmotions for continuance: first, immediately prior to Lopez’s testimony; second, at the\n\nbeginning of his counsel’s cross-examination of Lopez; and third, at the end of his cross-\n\nexamination of Lopez. We disagree.\n\n       A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       We review the trial court’s ruling on a motion for continuance for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 764 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Requests for a\n\ncontinuance after the trial has begun are expressly governed by the code of criminal\n\nprocedure, which provides:\n\n       A continuance or postponement may be granted on the motion of the State\n       or defendant after the trial has begun, when it is made to appear to the\n       satisfaction of the court that by some unexpected occurrence since the trial\n       began, which no reasonable diligence could have anticipated, the applicant\n       is so taken by surprise that a fair trial cannot be had.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 29.13 (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). The\n\nmotion must be in writing and fully state sufficient cause for the continuance. Id. art. 29.03\n\n(West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). The motion must also be sworn to “by a person\n\nhaving personal knowledge of the facts relied on for the continuance.” Id. art. 29.08\n\n(West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.); see Williams v. State, 356 S.W.3d 508, 521 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2011, pet. ref'd). A motion for continuance that is not in writing and not\n\nsworn preserves nothing for review. Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 755 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1999).\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       Appellant’s first and third motions were unwritten and unsworn and so did not\n\npreserve error for our review. See id. Appellant’s second motion, although in writing and\n\nsworn to by counsel, was insufficient to demonstrate that a continuance was warranted.\n\nA motion for continuance must cite an unexpected occurrence that the applicant’s counsel\n\ncould not have anticipated by reasonable diligence and show that the “applicant is so\n\ntaken by surprise that a fair trial cannot be had.” TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 29.13.\n\nAppellant’s motion cited the reason for the request, to review the CPS records, but did\n\nnot attempt to show that the existence of the audio recording could not have been\n\nanticipated by reasonable diligence. The motion also does not explain why a fair trial\n\ncould not be had without the continuance. See id; Barney v. State, 698 S.W.2d 114, 127\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (en banc) (holding that, under article 29.13, “it must appear to the\n\nsatisfaction of the court that ‘a fair trial cannot be had’ before a continuance or\n\npostponement is warranted”). Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the continuance. See Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 764. We overrule appellant’s first\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fissue.\n\n                       III. OBJECTION UNDER TEXAS RULE OF EVIDENCE 615\n\n         By his second issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it refused his\n\nmotion under Texas Rule of Evidence 615 to direct the State to produce a copy of Lopez’s\n\nreport to assist appellant’s counsel in cross-examination. We disagree.\n\n         A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n         The common-law Gaskin rule provided that, when a State’s witness made a report\n\nor gave a statement prior to testifying, the defendant is entitled on timely request to\n\ninspect the report or statement and to use it for purposes of cross-examination and\n\nimpeachment. Cullen v. State, 719 S.W.2d 195, 196 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) (en banc)\n\n(citing Gaskin v. State, 172 TEX. CRIM. 7, 353 S.W.2d 467 (1961)). This rule is now\n\ncodified in Texas Rule of Evidence 615, which provides:\n\n         After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination,\n         the court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, shall order the\n         attorney for the state or the defendant and defendant's attorney, as the case\n         may be, to produce, for the examination and use of the moving party, any\n         statement of the witness that is in their possession and that relates to the\n         subject matter concerning which the witness has testified.\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 615. The rule defines a “statement” as “a written statement made by the\n\nwitness that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness.” Id. R. 615(f)(1).\n\nIf the defendant timely moves for production of material covered by Texas Rule of\n\nEvidence 615, it is error for the trial court to deny production and access to it. Keith v.\n\nState, 916 S.W.2d 602, 606 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1996, no pet.).\n\n         Section 261.201 of the Texas Family Code provides that “reports,” among other\n\nmaterials, “used or developed” in an investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect\n\nmade under chapter 261 are confidential and may not be released. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.\n\n                                              9\n\f§ 261.201(a). A court may order the release of information made confidential under\n\nsection 261.201 if the following conditions are met: (1) a motion is filed requesting the\n\nrelease of the information; (2) notice of hearing has been served on the investigating\n\nagency and all interested parties; and (3) the court determines after the hearing and an\n\nin camera review of the requested information that disclosure of the requested information\n\nis essential to the administration of justice and is not likely to threaten the life or safety of\n\n(i) a child complainant, (ii) a person who made a report of alleged abuse, or (iii) any person\n\nwho participated in an investigation of abuse or neglect or who provided care for the child.\n\nId. § 261.201(b).\n\n        B. Discussion\n\n        Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to order production of\n\nLopez’s report at the beginning of his trial counsel’s cross-examination of Lopez as\n\nexpressly required by the rule. See TEX. R. EVID. 615. The State responds that the trial\n\ncourt did not err by denying the motion because Lopez’s report was protected under\n\nsection 261.201 of the Texas Family Code, and appellant did not follow the proper\n\nprocedure for gaining access to information protected by that section. See id.; see also\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 261.201. We agree with the State.\n\n        Appellant’s counsel moved for disclosure of the report under Texas Rule of\n\nEvidence 615, but he did not mention Texas Family Code section 261.201 or attempt to\n\ncomply with the procedure for releasing information classified as confidential under that\n\nsection. Because appellant did not attempt to comply at that time with the procedures for\n\nreleasing it,6 we hold the trial court did not err in overruling appellant’s objection under\n\n\n        6 Appellant’s counsel later filed a Motion for Disclosure of Confidential Records seeking access to\nthe entire CPS casefile, which we discuss below. However, appellant does not mention that motion under\n\n                                                   10\n\fTexas Rule of Evidence 615. See TEX. R. EVID. 615. We overrule appellant’s second\n\nissue.\n\n                                    IV. BRADY VIOLATIONS\n\n         Appellant asserts in his third issue that the State violated its duty to disclose\n\nfavorable and material information to appellant. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87\n\n(1963). We disagree.\n\n         A. Applicable Law\n\n         Under United States Supreme Court precedent beginning with Brady, the State is\n\nrequired to disclose evidence known to it that is favorable or material to a defendant’s\n\nguilt or punishment, whether or not the defendant requests it. Strickler v. Greene, 527\n\nU.S. 263, 280 (1999). This duty encompasses both impeachment as well as exculpatory\n\nevidence. Id. (citing United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985)). The good or\n\nbad faith of the prosecution is irrelevant. Brady, 373 U.S. at 87.\n\n         A defendant must show the following requirements to establish a Brady violation:\n\n(1) the State suppressed evidence; (2) the suppressed evidence is favorable to the\n\ndefendant; and (3) the suppressed evidence is material. Stickler, 527 U.S. at 281–82;\n\naccord Harm v. State, 183 S.W.3d 403, 406 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). “Favorable” evidence\n\nfor these purposes is any evidence that, if disclosed and used effectively, “may make the\n\ndifference between conviction and acquittal.” Harm, 183 S.W.3d at 406. Evidence is\n\n“material” for Brady purposes “only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the\n\nevidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.”   Ex parte Reed, 271 S.W.3d 698, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (internal\n\n\n\nthis issue.\n\n                                            11\n\fquotations omitted). A reasonable probability is one that is sufficient to undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome. Id.\n\n        The materiality prong incorporates a requirement that the defendant is prejudiced\n\nby the State’s failure to disclose the evidence.                 Harm, 183 S.W.3d at 406. When\n\ninformation is disclosed mid-trial, the prejudice inquiry involves determining whether the\n\ndisclosure came in time to make effective use of it at trial. Little v. State, 991 S.W.2d 864,\n\n866 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). “If the defendant received the material in time to use it\n\neffectively at trial, his conviction should not be reversed just because it was not disclosed\n\nas early as it might have and should have been.” Id.\n\n        B. Discussion\n\n        Appellant asserts that the State’s failure to disclose Lopez’s report and the Lopez\n\nRecording meets the second prong of the test because “C.T. had given numerous\n\nstatements and her credibility was important at the early stage of the trial.” Appellant\n\nreasons that Lopez’s report and the Lopez Recording show a “definite distinction”\n\nbetween the content of C.T.’s original outcry statements and her statements during the\n\ninterview at Maggie’s House. Appellant argues that he should have had access to the\n\nstatements “to sufficiently develop cross-examination of C.T.”7\n\n        We first address the second prong, the requirement that the suppressed evidence\n\nwas favorable. See Harm, 183 S.W.3d at 406. Lopez’s report and the recordings of the\n\nLopez interview do reveal some inconsistencies between C.T.’s original statements to\n\n\n\n\n         7 Appellant also argues that the late disclosure of the audio recording of B.F.’s interview with Lopez\n\nwas Brady error. We hold that appellant has waived error, if any, by failing to request a continuance when\nthe State moved to introduce the recording. See Perez v. State, 414 S.W.3d 784, 790 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (holding that failure to request a continuance waives Brady error); Young v. State,\n183 S.W.3d 699, 706 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2005, pet. ref'd) (same).\n\n                                                     12\n\fNatalie and Chesney, Office Andrade, Lopez, and her statement at Maggie’s House. For\n\nexample, on the Lopez Recording, C.T. describes an end date for the abuse closer to the\n\ndate of her outcry than the end date in her statement to the interviewer at Maggie’s House.\n\nC.T. also told the Maggie’s House interviewer that appellant forced her to perform oral\n\nsex on him more than five times, but did not give a specific number of times to Chesney\n\nor Natalie. C.T. also told the Maggie’s House interviewer that appellant attempted to\n\nvaginally penetrate her twice, while she told Lopez that it occurred only once. However,\n\nthe majority of C.T.’s statements on the Lopez Recording are consistent with C.T.’s other\n\nstatements; she consistently described the type of acts appellant would force her to\n\nperform and the type of acts appellant would perform on her. C.T.’s statements are also\n\nconsistent as to the abuse escalating in stages from vaginal touching, to forcing C.T. to\n\nperform oral sex and receiving oral sex from appellant, to one or more incidents where\n\nappellant allegedly tried to penetrate her vaginally with his penis. Moreover, during the\n\nLopez Recording, C.T. explained some of the discrepancies: she told Officer Andrade\n\nthat appellant did not force her to perform oral sex because she did not know the meaning\n\nof the term at the time of the interview. Appellant also asserts that C.T.’s description in\n\nthe Lopez Recording of the identifying features of appellant’s genital area “became an\n\nissue relating to [C.T.’s] credibility,” but Lopez testified that the description of appellant’s\n\ngenital area given by C.T.’s mother was similar to C.T.’s statement. The Lopez Recording\n\nand Lopez’s report, if anything, do more to demonstrate the consistency of C.T.’s\n\nstatements than to cast doubt on them.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence was not favorable to\n\nappellant. Even assuming, arguendo, that the second prong is met, we conclude that the\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fevidence is not material because there is not a reasonable probability that the result of\n\nthe trial would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed earlier. See Ex\n\nparte Reed, 271 S.W.3d at 727. When Brady evidence is disclosed during the trial, we\n\ninquire whether the defendant was able to effectively use the material despite the delay.\n\nSee Little, 991 S.W.2d at 866. Appellant argues that “it is unclear” how his counsel was\n\nsupposed to use Lopez’s report, given that it was only provided at the conclusion of\n\nLopez’s testimony. In fact, after the end of his cross-examination and before recessing\n\nfor the day, the judge asked for Lopez’s phone number and informed him that he was not\n\nreleased from his subpoena and subject to recall the next day. The trial court expressly\n\nafforded appellant’s counsel an opportunity to continue cross-examination of Lopez the\n\nnext day on the basis of the report. If appellant’s counsel wanted to use the report to\n\neffectively cross-examine Lopez, he had the opportunity to do so. Appellant does not\n\nexplain why he did not take the opportunity to recall and cross-examine Lopez the next\n\nmorning, or why he needed to use the information earlier in the cross-examination for it\n\nto be effective.\n\n       Appellant also argues that the audio recordings of C.T.’s interview with Lopez were\n\nmaterial. When denying appellant’s third request for a continuance, this time on the basis\n\nof a need to review the recordings, the trial judge stated on the record that there was no\n\nsubstantive detail in the Lopez Recording that was not included in Lopez’s report, which\n\nhad been disclosed earlier in the trial.8 After reviewing both pieces of evidence, we agree\n\nwith the trial judge. The substance of the report is the same as the substance of the\n\nLopez Recording. Moreover, despite the delayed disclosure, appellant’s counsel’s cross-\n\n\n       8  Two witnesses testified between the disclosure of the report and the beginning of the State’s\ndirect examination of C.T.\n\n                                                  14\n\fexamination of C.T. fills over seventy pages of the reporter’s record and dwells almost\n\nentirely on inconsistencies in C.T.’s multiple statements. Appellant does not explain how\n\na continuance would have enabled his counsel to more effectively use the recordings in\n\nhis cross-examination of C.T.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that appellant is unable to demonstrate that he was\n\nprejudiced by the late disclosure of Lopez’s report and the Lopez Recording. Appellant\n\nis thus unable to demonstrate the third prong of a Brady claim. See Little, 991 S.W.2d at\n\n866. We overrule appellant’s third issue.\n\n                                V. BRADY AND SECTION 261.201\n\n       By his fourth issue, appellant questions the relationship between the State’s duty\n\nto disclose all favorable and material information under Brady and the confidentiality\n\nrequirements of Texas Family Code section 261.201.           We understand appellant as\n\nasserting two arguments under this issue. Appellant’s first argument is that:\n\n       The balancing test as to whether CPS documents should be turned over to\n       the Appellant should not have been placed on the trial court or this Court of\n       Appeals. The State of Texas should play from a point of strength and\n       provide every defendant with the information they intend to use to convict\n       them. The State hid behind the premise that CPS records are privileged\n       information.\n\nAppellant’s second argument is that the trial court abused its discretion by not timely\n\ndisclosing the evidence that was the subject of his third issue.\n\n       We reject appellant’s argument that it was inappropriate for the trial court to\n\nconduct the Texas Family Code section 261.201(b)(3) balancing test to determine\n\nwhether to disclose material that appellant viewed as Brady evidence. The conflict that\n\ncan arise between the State’s need to keep information related to child abuse\n\ninvestigations confidential with a defendant’s need for a fair trial is well recognized. The\n\n                                            15\n\fUnited States Supreme Court confronted the problem in Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, where\n\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the appropriate method of assessing a claim\n\nthat information made confidential by statute is material under Brady “was to grant [the\n\ndefendant] full access to the disputed information, regardless of the State’s interest in\n\nconfidentiality.” 480 U.S. 39, 59 (1987). The United States Supreme Court rejected that\n\nconclusion, holding that the defendant’s interest in “ensuring a fair trial can be protected\n\nfully by requiring that the [state child protection agency] files be submitted only to the trial\n\ncourt for in camera review.” Id. at 60. Addressing a similar Texas statute, which made\n\ninformation given to Crime Stoppers confidential, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nheld that the defendant had the right to require the requested information be tendered to\n\nthe trial court for an in camera review, but rejected the argument that the defendant should\n\nbe accorded unlimited access to that information. Thomas v. State, 837 S.W.2d 106,\n\n113–14 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (en banc). The Thomas Court held that “both the State's\n\ninterest and the defendant's interest can be served by providing that crime stoppers\n\ninformation should be inspected by the trial court in camera.” Id. at 114.\n\n       Texas Family Code section 261.201 provides for exactly the type of procedure\n\napproved in Ritchie and Thomas: an in camera inspection of the material by the trial\n\njudge, and an ongoing duty to disclose any confidential material that is relevant or\n\nbecomes relevant during the course of the trial. See Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 60; see also\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 261.201. Appellant’s request that this Court “instruct Judges, and\n\nparticularly in Appellant’s case, that the CPS Records were essential to the administration\n\nof justice” runs directly contrary to the balance struck by both the United States Supreme\n\nCourt and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Bound by that precedent, we reject\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fappellant’s argument. See Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 60; Thomas, 837 S.W.2d at 114.\n\n       Regarding appellant’s second argument, he asserts that “[t]he trial court abused\n\nhis discretion in failing to timely turn over the audio tapes and documents to the Appellant.\n\nThe Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel.” The Texas Rules of\n\nAppellate Procedure require that an appellant’s brief “contain a clear and concise\n\nargument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the\n\nrecord.” TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Appellant does not explain his argument further or cite\n\nto any authorities except for the standard of review. We overrule appellant’s second\n\nargument as inadequately briefed. See id. We overrule appellant’s fourth issue.\n\n                                VI. IMPEACHMENT OF B.F.\n\n       Appellant argues in his fifth issue that the State did not lay the proper predicate\n\nbefore impeaching B.F. with her prior inconsistent statement. We disagree.\n\n   A. Standard of Review & Applicable Law\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence for a clear abuse of discretion,\n\nand we will not reverse as long as the judge’s decision lies within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. McCarty v. State, 257 S.W.3d 238, 239 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). We view\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s decision to admit the statement.\n\nKlein v. State, 273 S.W.3d 297, 304 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).\n\n       Texas Rule of Evidence 613(a) governs the impeachment of witnesses with prior\n\ninconsistent statements, and provides in pertinent part:\n\n       In examining a witness concerning a prior inconsistent statement made by\n       the witness, whether oral or written, and before further cross-examination\n       concerning, or extrinsic evidence of, such statement may be allowed, the\n       witness must be told the contents of such statement and the time and place\n       and the person to whom it was made, and must be afforded an opportunity\n       to explain or deny such statement.\n\n                                             17\n\fTEX. R. EVID. 613(a); Harris v. State, 152 S.W.3d 786, 795 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2004, pet. ref’d); Flores v. State, 48 S.W.3d 397, 404 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, pet. ref’d).\n\nThe trial court should not admit the prior inconsistent statement unless the proper\n\npredicate has been laid. Harris, 152 S.W.3d at 795 (citing Moore v. State, 652 S.W.2d\n\n411, 413 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983) (en banc)).\n\n   B. Discussion\n\n      Appellant argues that the recording of Lopez’s interview with B.F. was improperly\n\nadmitted because the State did not give B.F. the chance to “either admit or deny the\n\ntestimony.” The following exchange occurred between the State and B.F. before the\n\nState offered the audio recording into evidence:\n\n      [State]:      That's okay. Was there ever any time that your dad and [C.T.]\n                    were alone?\n\n      [B.F.]:       No.\n\n      [State]:      No? And it's okay if you don't but I want to try to refresh your\n                    memory, remember, okay? Do you remember talking with\n                    someone named Frank from Child Protective Services back\n                    in October at the St. John's house?\n\n      [B.F.]:       Yes.\n\n      [State]:      Yes? And do you remember talking to him and he was asking\n                    you questions?\n\n      [B.F.]:       Yes.\n\n      [State]:      And do you remember that he asked you if you had ever seen\n                    your dad and [C.T.] alone. Do you remember that?\n\n      [B.F.]:       Yes.\n\n      [State]:      And do you remember that you told him that you had seen\n                    them alone?\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f      [B.F.]:       I didn't say that.\n\n      [State]:      You didn't say that? Do you remember that you told him that\n                    you saw them alone a lot of times?\n\n      [B.F.]:       No.\n\n      [State]:      You didn't say that? Do you remember telling him that you\n                    saw them alone in your dad's bedroom?\n\n      [B.F.]:       No.\n\n      [State]:      And that the door was closed?\n\n      [B.F.]:       No.\n\n      [State]:      Do you remember saying that you and your brother would be\n                    watching television when that happened?\n\n      [B.F.]:       No.\n\n      In the above exchange, the State informed B.F. of the substance of the\n\ninconsistent statement, the time and place in which it was made, and gave her an\n\nopportunity to admit or deny that she made the statement. See TEX. R. EVID. 613(a).\n\nOnce B.F. denied that she told Lopez during the interview on October 3, 2011 that\n\nappellant and C.T. were frequently alone together, the State met all of the requirements\n\nof Texas Rule of Evidence 613(a). See id. We overrule appellant’s fifth issue.\n\n                 VII. LIMITING INSTRUCTION ON IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE\n\n      Appellant argues by his sixth issue that the court erred by denying his request for\n\na limiting instruction on the audio recording of B.F.’s interview with Lopez. We disagree.\n\n      A. Applicable Law\n\n      Texas Rule of Evidence 105 provides in pertinent part:\n\n      When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but\n      not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the\n      court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and\n\n                                           19\n\f       instruct the jury accordingly; but, in the absence of such request the court's\n       action in admitting such evidence without limitation shall not be a ground for\n       complaint on appeal.\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 105(a). The party opposing the evidence must request a limiting instruction\n\nwhen the trial court admits the evidence or else it is admitted “for all purposes.” Arrington\n\nv. State, 451 S.W.3d 834, 842 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015); Hammock v. State, 46 S.W.3d\n\n889, 894 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). The reason for requiring a contemporaneous request\n\nfor a limiting instruction is that “[a]llowing the jury to consider evidence for all purposes\n\nand then telling them to consider that same evidence for a limited purpose only is asking\n\na jury to do the impossible.” Hammock, 46 S.W.3d at 894.\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       When the State offered the recording of B.F.’s interview with Lopez into evidence,\n\nappellant objected on the basis of relevance, optional completeness, and improper\n\nimpeachment of a witness, but, like the defendant in Hammock, did not request a limiting\n\ninstruction until the charge conference.     See id. at 895.    Appellant asserts that his\n\nobjection on the basis of improper impeachment was sufficient to put the trial court on\n\nnotice that a limiting instruction should be given, but provides no support for this\n\nproposition. Appellant, as the party opposing the evidence, had the burden to request a\n\nlimiting instruction at the time the trial court admitted the evidence. See Garcia v. State,\n\n887 S.W.2d 862, 878 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (en banc), abrogated in part on other\n\ngrounds, Hammock, 46 S.W.3d at 893; accord Reeves v. State, 99 S.W.3d 657, 658 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Waco 2003, pet. ref'd); Arana v. State, 1 S.W.3d 824, 829 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1999, pet. ref'd). Because appellant did not request a limiting instruction at\n\nthe first opportunity, we hold that the court did not err in not giving the instruction. See\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\fArrington, 451 S.W.3d at 842; Hammock, 46 S.W.3d at 895. We overrule appellant’s\n\nsixth issue.\n\n               VIII. ADMISSION OF VIDEO FROM MAGGIE’S HOUSE INTERVIEW\n\n       By his seventh issue, appellant argues the trial court erred in admitting the video\n\nrecording of C.T.’s interview at Maggie’s House because it did not meet the requirements\n\nfor admission of prior consistent statements of a witness. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(e)(1)(c).\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence for a clear abuse of discretion,\n\nand we will not reverse as long as the judge’s decision lies within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. McCarty, 257 S.W.3d at 239. We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the trial court’s decision. See Klein, 273 S.W.3d at 304.\n\n       A prior consistent statement of a witness is generally inadmissible except as\n\nprovided by Texas Rule of Evidence 801. TEX. R. EVID. 613(c). Under that rule, a prior\n\nconsistent statement of a witness is admissible if (1) the witness has testified and is\n\nsubject to cross-examination, and (2) the statement is “consistent with the declarant's\n\ntestimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of\n\nrecent fabrication or improper influence or motive.” TEX. R. EVID. 801(e)(1)(c). The trial\n\ncourt has substantial discretion to admit a prior consistent statement even if there has\n\nbeen “only a suggestion of conscious alteration or fabrication.” Hammons v. State, 239\n\nS.W.3d 798, 804–05 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The rule\n\ndoes not permit courts to admit evidence that would otherwise be hearsay whenever a\n\nwitness’s memory or credibility is challenged, but there is no bright-line rule to distinguish\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fbetween a general challenge to the witness’s memory or credibility and a suggestion of\n\nconscious alteration or fabrication. Id. at 805. The trial court should determine if the\n\ncross-examiner’s questions or the tenor of the questioning would “reasonably imply an\n\nintent by the witness to fabricate.” Id. The implication may be subtle and may come\n\nthrough the “tone, tenor, and demeanor” of the questioning or the cross-examiner. Id. at\n\n808. Reviewing courts, “in assessing whether the cross-examination of a witness makes\n\nan implied charge of recent fabrication or improper motive, should focus on the purpose\n\nof the impeaching party, the surrounding circumstances, and the interpretation put on\n\nthem by the [trial] court.” Id. (brackets and emphasis in the original, internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      B. Discussion\n\n      Two exchanges occurred between appellant’s counsel and C.T. during cross-\n\nexamination. The first exchange referenced inconsistencies between C.T.’s previous\n\nstatements and those she made during her interview at Maggie’s House regarding the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the first incident of abuse:\n\n      [Defense]:    You said you were eight years old?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense]:    The first time it occurred, right?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense]:    You also said it happened in Pittsburgh, Texas?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense]:    Okay. You said you were in the third grade?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f[Defense]:   Okay. It's also true that you said that you're alleging that you\n             were touched on your vagina with the fingers; is that right?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   So you are saying that this happened before your\n             grandmother [name omitted] was going to pick you up for a\n             performance; is that right?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   Okay. And after this occurred your grandmother picked you\n             up; is that right?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   [C.T.], isn't it true that you told the interviewer Monica Galvan\n             at Maggie's House that that was not the first time it occurred?\n             Didn't you give her a different account of the first time it\n             occurred?\n\n[C.T.]:      I corrected myself at the end of the interview.\n\n[Defense]:   You corrected yourself at the end of the interview?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   So that would be in that interview if you corrected yourself at\n             the end of that interview, it would be in that interview that the\n             state has; is that correct?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   Isn't it true that you told the interviewer at Maggie's House the\n             first time it happened was in fact when you did come home\n             sick one day from school?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   Okay. And you'd agree those are two different statements,\n             right? Two different recollections of the first time it occurred?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir. But I did correct myself at the end of that video\n\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\f         The second exchange referenced inconsistencies between C.T.’s testimony and\n\nher statements at Maggie’s House regarding the time period in which the abuse ceased:\n\n         [Defense]:   All right. You also talked that he would also touch your\n                      breasts; is that right?\n\n         [C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n         [Defense]:   What would he do when he would touch your breast[s]? What\n                      happened then?\n\n         [C.T.]:      He just moved them around or he’d grab his thumb around my\n                      nipples or he’d suck on them.\n\n         [Defense]:   When was the last time that occurred that he ever did that?\n                      Do you remember?\n\n         [C.T.]:      I don’t have an exact date. I don’t remember exactly when.\n\n         [Defense]:   Did you ever give an estimation to anyone as to when that\n                      may have stopped?\n\n         [C.T.]:      No, sir.\n\n         [Defense]:   You never told the interviewer at Monica’s House when it\n                      stopped, at Maggie’s House?\n\n         [C.T.]:      Not that I can remember.\n\n         [Defense]:   You never told her that it stopped before July 4th?\n\n         [C.T.]:      Not that I can remember.\n\n         As appellant reiterated multiple times on appeal, his trial counsel’s overriding\n\nstrategy was to highlight the inconsistencies in C.T.’s various statements to Chesney,\n\nNatalie, Officer Andrade, Lopez, the Maggie’s House interviewer, and her testimony at\n\ntrial.   Trial counsel’s cross-examination of C.T. dwelt almost entirely on various\n\ninconsistencies in her statements. In the selections we quoted above, counsel identified\n\ntwo inconsistencies between the Maggie’s House interview and other statements: C.T.’s\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fdescription of the first incident of abuse and the time period in which it ceased. The trial\n\ncourt evidently interpreted the “tone, tenor, and demeanor” of the questioning as raising\n\na charge of fabrication by commenting that appellant “called the issue of consistency or\n\ninconsistency into issue.” Thus, the purpose of the impeaching party, the surrounding\n\ncircumstances, and the trial court’s interpretation of the questioning all support the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling.   See Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at 808.           Deferring to the trial court’s\n\n“substantial discretion” to admit prior consistent statements after determining that the\n\nwitness’s credibility has been challenged, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\nadmitting the recording. See id. at 804–05\n\n       Appellant presents an additional argument under this issue: even if the State’s\n\ntheory is correct, the tape should not have been admitted into evidence because the State\n\ndid not segregate the admissible portions of the interview from those containing\n\ninadmissible statements. Appellant objected on hearsay grounds, but he did not request\n\nthat the State segregate the inadmissible portions, if any, from what was admissible.\n\nAppellant is correct in his argument that Texas Court of Criminal Appeals precedent is\n\nthat if admissible and inadmissible statements are not segregated the trial judge “may\n\nproperly exclude all of the statements,” but the Court held in the same case cited by\n\nappellant that the “trial court need never sort through challenged evidence in order to\n\nsegregate the admissible from the excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n\nthe former part or exclude only the latter part.” Willover v. State, 70 S.W.3d 841, 847\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Whitaker v. State, 286\n\nS.W.3d 355, 369 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); Reyna v. State, 168 S.W.3d 173, 178 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2005). Following Willover, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\fdiscretion in admitting the entire portion of the interview because appellant did not request\n\nthat the inadmissible and admissible portions of the recording be segregated or specify\n\nwhich portions were inadmissible. See Whitaker, 286 S.W.3d at 369; Reyna, 168 S.W.3d\n\nat 178; Willover, 70 S.W.3d at 847. We overrule appellant’s seventh issue.\n\n                                  IX. WITNESS COMMENTARY\n\n       By his eighth issue, appellant argues that the State elicited improper opinion\n\ntestimony from Chesney, Lopez, Detective Cisneros, Sonia Eddleman,9 and C.T.’s\n\nbiological father on the credibility of C.T.’s allegations. We disagree.\n\n       To preserve error for appellate review, the complaining party must make a timely,\n\nspecific request or objection and obtain an adverse ruling from the trial court. TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 33.1(a); Brewer v. State, 367 S.W.3d 251, 253 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). Failure to\n\nobject to the admission of evidence waives any complaint on appeal. Reyes v. State, 84\n\nS.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Our review of the record shows that appellant\n\ndid not object to any of the testimony he now references in his brief. Appellant has not\n\ndirected us to any place in the record where he objected. Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nappellant has waived this issue. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a); see Brewer, 367 S.W.3d at 253;\n\nReyes, 84 S.W.3d at 638. We overrule appellant’s eighth issue.\n\n                       X. TESTIMONY OF JUSTICE OF THE PEACE DAVID GARZA\n\n       Appellant argues by his ninth issue that the trial court erred by refusing to present\n\nJustice of the Peace David Garza as a witness. Appellant’s counsel requested on the\n\nrecord that the court permit him to call Judge Garza because he wanted to solicit\n\ntestimony regarding why Judge Garza found a probable-cause affidavit submitted by\n\n\n       9   Sonia Eddleman, a trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, did not personally examine C.T., but\ntestified to the contents of C.T.’s medical records after reviewing them.\n\n                                                  26\n\fDetective Cisneros to be insufficient to justify issuing a warrant. The trial judge stated\n\nthat he would not allow Judge Garza to be subject to subpoena “to testify as to his mental\n\nprocess on granting or denying anything.”                Appellant asserts that the court’s ruling\n\nviolated his right to compulsory process to obtain witnesses under the state and federal\n\nconstitutions. We disagree.\n\n        A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n        Criminal defendants have a right under the state and federal constitutions to\n\ncompulsory process to obtain witnesses. See U.S. CONST. amend. VI; TEX. CONST. art. I,\n\n§ 10; see also Williams v. State, 273 S.W.3d 200, 232 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). But that\n\nright is not absolute. Tope v. State, 429 S.W.3d 75, 83 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2014, no pet.). We review limitations on the right to compulsory process for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Lawal v. State, 368 S.W.3d 876, 885 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012,\n\nno pet.) (citing Drew v. State, 743 S.W.2d 207, 225 n. 11 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (en\n\nbanc)).\n\n        B. Discussion\n\n        As a general rule, judges may testify in proceedings over which they are not\n\npresiding if they are competent to do so.10 Hensarling v. State, 829 S.W.2d 168, 171\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (en banc). However, courts have refused to issue subpoenas for\n\njudges to testify about the mental processes by which they reached a decision “absent\n\nextreme and extraordinary circumstances.” Gary W. v. State of La., Dept. of Health &\n\n\n\n\n        10 A judge may not testify in a proceeding over which the judge is presiding. TEX. R. EVID. 605;\n\nHensarling v. State, 829 S.W.2d 168, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (en banc); State v. Stewart, 282 S.W.3d\n729, 736 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.). The Texas Supreme Court has held that that this rule applies\nnot only to judges but also to all persons performing judicial functions. Bradley v. State ex rel. White, 990\nS.W.2d 245, 249 (Tex. 1999).\n\n                                                    27\n\fHuman Res., 861 F.2d 1366, 1369 (5th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\nFifth Circuit has explained that permitting “such an examination of a judge would be\n\ndestructive of judicial responsibility” because:\n\n       While a judge enjoys no special privilege from being subpoenaed as a\n       witness, it is imperative when he is called to testify as to action taken in his\n       judicial capacity, to carefully scrutinize the grounds set forth for requiring his\n       testimony. Should a judge be vulnerable to subpoena as to the basis of\n       every action taken by him, the judiciary would be open to frivolous attacks\n       upon its dignity and integrity, and interruption of its ordinary and proper\n       functioning.\n\nUnited States v. Anderson, 560 F.3d 275, 282 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Gary W., 861 F.2d\n\nat 1369); see United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422 (1941) (suggesting that a judge\n\ncannot be required to testify regarding his mental impressions of a case). The few Texas\n\ncourts to address cases where a non-presiding judge was called to testify have all\n\nrecognized the federal “mental processes” rule or have spoken of it with approval.\n\nThomas v. Walker, 860 S.W.2d 579, 582 (Tex. App.—Waco 1993, orig. proceeding)\n\n(citing Morgan, 313 U.S. at 421); Tate v. State, 834 S.W.2d 566, 570 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1992, pet. ref'd).   When confronted with an appeal challenging an order\n\nquashing a subpoena of a visiting judge who presided over a portion of the defendant’s\n\ncase, the First Court of Appeals reasoned as follows:\n\n       Texas law has not established circumstances or conditions under which a\n       judicial official might properly be compelled to articulate his reasons for a\n       decision in a particular case, and we do not propose to state such a rule\n       here. However, we conclude that if such a rule were to be established, the\n       better rule would require, at the very least, a threshold showing of improper\n       conduct on the part of the judge that would justify compelling him to testify.\n\nTate, 834 S.W.2d at 570.\n\n       We find the Tate Court’s reasoning to be sound and apply it to the situation before\n\nus. Texas law has not established under what circumstances or conditions a non-\n\n                                              28\n\fpresiding judge or judicial officer may be called to testify about their mental processes,\n\nbut if we were to establish such a rule, it would at least require a threshold showing of\n\nimproper conduct on the part of the judge. See id.; Walker, 860 S.W.2d at 582 (requiring\n\na threshold showing of improper conduct on the part of a judge to justify requiring the\n\njudge to testify regarding his mental processes); see also Sims v. Fitzpatrick, 288 S.W.3d\n\n93, 102 n.5 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (citing Tate and noting that\n\neven if appellants had preserved their general complaint that the assigned judges erred\n\nin quashing subpoenas issued to the trial judge, they still would have to show the\n\nexistence of extraordinary circumstances). In this case, appellant has made no showing\n\nof improper conduct on the part of Judge Garza or shown any other extraordinary\n\ncircumstance that would justify requiring him to testify. Applying the reasoning of Tate,\n\nwe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit appellant to\n\ncall Judge Garza as a witness. See Tate, 834 S.W.2d at 570. We overrule appellant’s\n\nninth issue.\n\n                XI. OBJECTIONS UNDER TEXAS RULES OF EVIDENCE 402/403/404\n\n        Appellant argues in his tenth, eleventh, and twelfth issues that the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error by overruling his objections under Texas Rules of Evidence\n\n402, 403, and 404 to Natalie’s testimony that she warned Chesney not to be in the pool\n\nwith appellant because he “acted like a teenage boy and not like a dad in the pool with\n\nthe girls.”\n\n        A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n        We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence for a clear abuse of discretion,\n\nnot reversing so long as the judge’s decision lies within the zone of reasonable\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\fdisagreement. McCarty, 257 S.W.3d at 239. We will uphold the ruling if it is correct on\n\nany applicable theory of law even if the trial court relied on an incorrect reason for\n\nreaching its decision. De La Paz v. State, 279 S.W.3d 336, 344 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       The following exchange occurred during the State’s redirect examination of\n\nNatalie:\n\n       [State]:      And defense counsel was talking with you about how the\n                     defendant would come over to your house. You said that he\n                     would spend time outside, and you also said that occasionally\n                     when he did [come] into your house you were there, correct?\n                     And defense counsel [sic] said that stated you must be okay\n                     with him being around your children. Is that a correct\n                     statement?\n\n       [Natalie]:    I'm really careful about who’s around my kids. Like did I have\n                     them babysit or babysit my children, to [?]\n\n       [State]:      Would you leave your kids alone with him?\n\n       [Natalie]:    No.\n\n       [State]:      Did they ever stay alone with him?\n\n       [Natalie]:    No.\n\n       [State]:      Did you ever warn your children?\n\n       [Natalie]:    Yes. I told my daughter to—\n\n       [Defense]:    Objection, Your Honor, relevance.\n\n       [State]:      Your Honor, Defense counsel made it clear—\n\n       [Trial Judge]: I’m going to overrule that objection.\n\n       [State]:      You can answer.\n\n       [Natalie]:    I just told my daughter not to be alone with [Appellant] and\n                     especially, well, I told her never to be in the swimming pool\n                     with him.\n\n                                             30\n\f        Appellant’s counsel requested to approach the bench. After a bench conference\n\noff the record, the trial judge held a hearing outside of the presence of the jury to consider\n\nappellant’s renewed objections.11 At the hearing, Natalie testified that her full answer to\n\nthe State’s question would have been that she “had seen inappropriate behavior between\n\nhim and other girls, and between him and my daughter. Just like you would see from a\n\nteen-age boy trying to accidentally cop a feel only he’s a dad.” The trial judge overruled\n\nappellant’s objections but stated that he would allow the State “to go into it very briefly,\n\nbut only very briefly.” The trial judge also instructed that Natalie should not state that\n\nappellant would try to “cop a feel.” The State responded that it would “not go beyond\n\nwhat has already been said.” Natalie testified in the presence of the jury that she did not\n\nwant Chesney to be in the pool with appellant because he “acted like a teen-age boy and\n\nnot like a dad in the pool with the girls.” Natalie further testified that she thought this was\n\n“very inappropriate behavior.”\n\n        Appellant argues that the court’s ruling was error, but we conclude that the error,\n\nif any, was harmless. We review the erroneous admission of evidence concerning\n\nextraneous offenses or bad acts for harm under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure\n\n44.2(b). Casey v. State, 215 S.W.3d 870, 885 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); see TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 44.2(b). Under this standard, we must disregard the error if, after examining the record\n\nas a whole, we have come to a “fair assurance” that the error did not affect appellant’s\n\n\n\n        11Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 33.1 requires a timely and specific objection to appear in the\nrecord. See Tucker v. State, 990 S.W.2d 261, 262 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (en banc) (citing TEX. R. APP. P.\n33.1). Appellant did not renew his objections on the record. However, during the hearing, after Natalie\nanswered the judge’s question regarding what her testimony would have been had appellant’s counsel not\nasked to approach, counsel responded: “Judge, that’s totally [inadmissible] under [Texas Rules of\nEvidence] 402, 403, and 404.” We will treat appellant’s counsel’s statement as a further renewal of his\nobjections that is sufficient to preserve error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1.\n\n                                                   31\n\fsubstantial rights, see TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2, because it did not influence the jury’s verdict\n\nor had but a slight effect. Casey, 215 S.W.3d at 855. In assessing the likelihood that the\n\njury’s decision was adversely affected by the error, we pay particular attention to factors\n\nsuch as the testimony or physical evidence admitted for the jury’s consideration, the\n\nnature of the evidence supporting the verdict, the character of the alleged error, and how\n\nit may be considered in connection with other evidence in the case. Haley v. State, 173\n\nS.W.3d 510, 518 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). We may also consider the jury instructions, the\n\nState’s theories, any defensive theories, closing arguments, voir dire, and the State’s\n\nemphasis on the error. Id. at 518–19.\n\n       After examining the record of the trial as a whole, we conclude that the error, if\n\nany, in admitting this part of Natalie’s testimony did not have a substantial and injurious\n\neffect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict. First, the jury heard substantial\n\ntestimony from Chesney, Natalie, and C.T. regarding appellant’s actions. Second, neither\n\nthe State nor appellant emphasized this portion of Natalie’s testimony. Third, the alleged\n\nerror did not affect appellant’s defensive theory, which was to call into question the\n\ntruthfulness of C.T.’s statements as a whole. Given the miniscule part that Natalie’s\n\ntestimony played in the State’s case and the State’s lack of emphasis on it, the jury likely\n\ngave it little weight in comparison to the other evidence before it. See id. at 518. Based\n\non the whole record of the trial, if there was an error in admitting this portion of Natalie’s\n\ntestimony, it did not have a substantial or injurious effect or influence in determining the\n\njury’s verdict. See Casey, 215 S.W.3d at 855. We overrule appellant’s tenth, eleventh,\n\nand twelfth issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\f                    XII. COMMENTS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE AND PROSECUTOR\n\n       By his thirteenth and fourteenth issues, appellant argues that the trial judge and\n\nthe State committed fundamental error by making improper comments during voir dire.\n\nTo preserve a complaint of improper voir dire for appellate review, a party must make a\n\ntimely and specific objection and receive an adverse ruling from the trial court. Archie v.\n\nState, 221 S.W.3d 695, 699 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1. Here, because\n\nappellant did not object, he has waived his complaint on appeal except for fundamental\n\nerror. See Archie, 221 S.W.3d at 699; McLean v. State, 312 S.W.3d 912, 915 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n       A. Standard for Fundamental Error\n\n       The applicable test for determining whether an error during voir dire is\n\nfundamental, and therefore may be raised for the first time on appeal, is whether the error\n\ninvolves a violation of a right that is “waivable only” or a denial of an absolute, systemic\n\nrequirement. Aldrich v. State, 104 S.W.3d 890, 895 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). This Court\n\nhas held in the past that the right to an impartial judge is an absolute, systemic\n\nrequirement that may be raised for the first time on appeal if the judge’s comments are\n\n“so egregious as to deem the judge biased.” Hernandez v. State, 268 S.W.3d 176, 185–\n\n86 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2008, no pet.).\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       Appellant argues here that the trial judge commented on the evidence and shifted\n\nthe burden of proof by saying in reference to the State’s burden that: “[i]t's not a problem.\n\nYou wouldn't be here if they didn't think they could prove it . . . .” However, we evaluate\n\na judge’s comments in the context of the record as a whole. See Lopez v. State, 415\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\fS.W.3d 495, 498 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.). The trial judge’s full remarks\n\nare as follows:\n\n       [The prosecutors] have the burden of proving the guilt and that burden never\n       switches. It's a burden that they welcome. It's not a problem. You wouldn't\n       be here if they didn't think they could prove it, however, whether they prove\n       it or not is something that you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       Read in context, the trial judge’s remarks did not shift the burden of proof away\n\nfrom the State. The trial judge specifically reiterated that the State bears the burden of\n\nproof and that the jury is the sole judge of whether the State succeeded in proving its\n\ncase beyond a reasonable doubt.             We hold that appellant has not demonstrated\n\nfundamental error because he has not shown that the judge’s comments were so\n\negregious as to deem him biased. See Hernandez, 268 S.W.3d at 185–86.\n\n       With regard to the prosecutor’s comments, appellant has not directed us to any\n\nauthority that improper arguments or comments during voir dire by a party, as opposed\n\nto the trial judge, rise to the level of fundamental error. However, by arguing the State\n\nshifted the burden of proof, appellant’s argument could be interpreted as going to the\n\nabsolute, systemic requirement that a person may only be found guilty of an offense if a\n\nrational trier of fact finds sufficient evidence to prove all of the elements of the offense\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 362–64 (1970). Assuming,\n\nwithout deciding, that arguments by the State during voir dire shifting the burden of proof\n\nmay rise to the level of fundamental error, we will address appellant’s claims that the\n\nState’s comments shifted the burden of proof to appellant in the interests of justice.12\n\n\n\n\n       12 The Amarillo Court adopted this approach when faced with a similar claim. See Huff v. State,\nNo. 07-10-00174-CR, 2010 WL 4828491, at *3 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Nov. 29, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op., not\ndesignated for publication).\n\n                                                 34\n\f       Appellant cites the following portions of the State’s voir dire in support of his\n\nargument that the State shifted the burden of proof to appellant:\n\n       Without you our system would fall apart. The bottom line is we can have a\n       case and it can have law enforcement that goes out to the scene, there can\n       be child protective services involved, we can have forensic interviewers, we\n       can have medical examiners, we can have prosecutors, we can have\n       investigators, but it wouldn't be anything without you because at the end of\n       the day we can bring the case to you that we believe we can prove beyond\n       a reasonable doubt but if you guys don't go there with us, if you don't sit and\n       listen to it, we've all done it in vain.\n\n       Shortly afterwards, during voir dire, the prosecutor stated:\n\n       Sexual abuse of children is a very conflicting topic. It's polarizing. People\n       don't want to hear about it. Raise your card if you know right now you don't\n       want to hear about it. So almost everybody. Raise them high. Keep them\n       up please, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and it goes on and on and on.\n       The truth is I don't blame you. When I started as a prosecutor, I didn't want\n       to hear about it either. But the truth is if everybody had a strong reaction to\n       child abuse didn't sit on jury panels, if that was a reason for you to be\n       excused from jury duty today, then either we wouldn't be able to have these\n       trials because there wouldn't be anybody to hear them or the people, worse,\n       the people that heard them would be people who didn't get emotional about\n       child abuse and what a tragedy that would be.\n\n       In the first quoted portion of voir dire, the State emphasized that the role of the jury\n\nis important and that the State believed that it could carry its burden of proving its case\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Before voir dire began, the trial judge emphasized that the\n\nburden of proof rests with the State to prove all elements of the charged offenses beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, and the jury charge reflected that fundamental requirement. In the\n\nsecond quoted portion, read in context, the prosecutor merely mentions how\n\nuncomfortable many people feel at the thought of sexual abuse of children and asks the\n\nmembers of the venire to refrain from seeking not to serve because they might feel\n\nuncomfortable hearing the evidence in this case. We find nothing in either argument that\n\nshifts the burden of proof to the defense or asks jurors to convict on the basis of the jurors’\n\n                                              35\n\femotional repugnance for child abuse rather than the evidence presented in the State’s\n\ncase. We hold that State’s comments do not rise to the level of fundamental error. See\n\nAldirch, 104 S.W.3d at 895. We overrule appellant’s thirteenth and fourteenth issues.\n\n                                XIII. CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n       By his fifteenth issue, appellant argues that the cumulative effect of all of the errors\n\nraised in his other issues requires reversal. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has\n\nobserved that “[i]t is conceivable that a number of errors may be found harmful in their\n\ncumulative effect,” but there is no authority that “non-errors may in their cumulative effect\n\ncause error.” Chamberlain v. State, 998 S.W.2d 230, 238 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (en\n\nbanc). Because we have found no error in all but one of appellant’s issues and here\n\nconcluded that that error, if any, was harmless, there is no cumulative error requiring\n\nreversal. See id.; Gallegos v. State, 340 S.W.3d 797, 805 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011,\n\nno pet.) (holding that there was no cumulative error requiring reversal when the court of\n\nappeals overruled all but one of the appellant’s other issues). We overrule appellant’s\n\nfifteenth issue.\n\n                                    XIV. CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                    NORA L.

When the victim and the individual reporting the alleged crime to CPS are\n\n     known to all parties does Texas Family Code 261.201 as it relates to the\n\n     Texas Code Criminal Procedure 39.14 require strict compliance. The\n\n     legislature has created an unworkable procedure that denies an accused\n\n     access to CPS records for cross examination and the preparation of a\n\n     defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\fTO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:\n\n      COMES NOW, RONALD BLAKE FEARS, Petitioner in the above\n\nentitled and numbered cause, by and through his attorney of record Douglas H.\n\nPettit and files this Petition for Discretionary Review and, in support of which,\n\nwould respectfully show this Honorable Court the following:\n\n                       QUESTION PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n\n      When the victim and the individual reporting the alleged crime to CPS are\n      known to all parties, does Texas Family Code 261.201 as it relates to the\n      Texas Code Criminal Procedure 39.14 require strict compliance. The\n      Legislature has created an unworkable procedure that denies an accused\n      access to CPS records for cross examination and the preparation of a\n      defense.\n\n                       ARGUMENT or REASON FOR REVIEW\n\n      The issue concerns CPS records and the trial court and district attorney‟s\n\noffice failure to turn those records over to trial counsel. The State‟s position was\n\nthe records were not discoverable under Texas Family Code 261.201. (R.R. Vol 4\n\np. 187) (R.R. Vol 4 p. 261) (R.R.Vol 5 p. 138) This is conflict with the procedure\n\nset out in Texas Code Criminal Procedure 39.14. District Attorney's continue to\n\nrely on Texas Family Code 261.201 to deny an accused access to CPS records\n\nwhen the victim is known and the person reporting the alleged crime to CPS is\n\nknown.\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                       ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n      The individual who reported the alleged crime to CPS was also the \"outcry\n\nwitness\" in this case. (R.R. Vol 3 p 78) (R.R. Vol 3 p. 92). The victim of the\n\nalleged abuse was the step daughter of the Petitioner. (R.R. Vol 3. p. 73) Trial\n\nCounsel was not permitted to review the CPS records prior to trial or during cross\n\nexamination of the CPS worker. (R.R Vol. 4 p. 190) (R.R. Vol 4 p. 260) It is\n\nfurther alleged that two audio statements taken by CPS of the victim and her sister\n\nwere not turned over prior to the trial.\n\n      Reading Texas Code of Procedure 39.14 it expressly refers to Texas\n\nFamily Code 264.408, which refers to Texas Family Code 261.201. Texas Code\n\nCriminal Procedure 39.14 indicates that subject to the restrictions listed in\n\n264.408 the information should be turned over. Texas Family Code 264.408\n\napplies to public release of information under Chapter 552, public records\n\nrequests and lists that the video tapes should not be copied, not disclosure denied.\n\nThus the courts must look back to the Texas Family Code 261.201.\n\n      The Thirteenth Court of Appeal upheld the trial court‟s ruling holding the\n\nPetitioner was not entitled to view CPS records which contained the investigators\n\nreport and oral tape recorded statements of victim and her sister pursuant to Texas\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fFamily Code 261.201.2\n\n       Petitioner‟s attorney first request for the records came after direct\n\nexamination and prior to cross examination of the CPS worker. (R.R. Vol 4 p.190)\n\nThe request was made under Texas Rules of Evidence 615 in order to conduct\n\ncross examination of the investigating officer. The records were turned over to the\n\ncourt after cross examination. (R.R. Vol 4 p. 264) The Trial Court provided a\n\nlimited amount of the material for counsel after his examination was concluded.\n\n       During the direct examination of the child victim it was learned that\n\nadditional information contained within the CPS records had not been given to the\n\nPetitioner's trial attorney. The child victim had been interviewed by CPS worker\n\nand the interview had been audio recorded. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 136) Prior to the cross\n\nexamination of child victim by the defendant‟s trial counsel requested that he be\n\nallowed to listen to the audio tape. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 138). The Trial Court first\n\ninquired whether the Defendant‟s attorney had previously had an opportunity to\n\nlisten to the tape. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 138) and the State of Texas responded that “they\n\nwere not allowed to disclose CPS recordings. (R.R. Vol 5 p. 138) The Court\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The record submitted to the 13th Court of Appeals also contains CPS records in the possession\nof the Assistant District Attorney and these documents have not been reviewed by trial counsel\nor appellant counsel but were ordered sealed by the trial court.\n\n                                              10\n\fordered that those be turned over to trial counsel prior to the cross examination of\n\nthe victim. (R.R. Vol 5 p 138)\n\n      Petitioner‟s attorney requested three continuances from the Court during the\n\ntrial to prepare for cross examination of witnesses and review the CPS records. All\n\nrequests were denied.\n\n      The Court of Appeals in their opinion stated that “the conflict that can arise\n\nbetween the State‟s need to keep information related to child abuse investigations\n\nconfidential with a defendant‟s need for a fair trial is well recognized” citing\n\nPennsylvania vs. Richie </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59, (1987). The Thirteenth Court of Appeals\n\nused the example regarding the Crime Stoppers information as stated in Thomas v.\n\nState </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1789109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1789109/thomas-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. 106,113-114 (Tex Crim. App. 1992) The Court of Appeals also\n\nstated that Texas Family Code section 262.201 provides for exactly the type of\n\nprocedure approved in Ritchie and Thomas. . This requires an in camera\n\ninspection of the material by the trial judge; and an ongoing duty to disclose any\n\nconfidential material that is relevant; or that becomes relevant during the trial.\n\n      The process set up in Tex. Family Code 261.201 for obtaining CPS records\n\nfor an accused is unworkable as it relates to criminal prosecution. The Court‟s\n\nopinion is out of touch with the reality of trial work. It infringes on the Defendant‟s\n\nright to confront and cross examine a witness as guaranteed by the 6th and 14th\n\n                                          11\n\famendment to the United States Constitution and Article I section 10 of the\n\nTexas Constitution.\n\n      The procedure is unworkable for two reasons. First it places the emphasis\n\non the district judge to review and decipher the information. Second it also\n\ndemands that the District Attorney actually turn over all the CPS documents to the\n\ntrial court for review.\n\n      The Federal standard requiring only an in camera review by the trial judge of\n\nprivileged records requested by the defendant rests on the assumptions that trial\n\njudges can temporarily and effectively assume the role of advocate when\n\nexamining such records; and that the interests of the State and complainant in the\n\nconfidentiality of the records cannot adequately be protected in any other way.\n\nNeither assumption withstands close scrutiny.\n\n      As to the first assumption, the United States Supreme Court has said that “\n\n„it [is] extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under\n\nthe pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the [information] that would be\n\nuseful in impeaching a witness.‟ ... Nor is it realistic to assume that the trial court's\n\njudgment as to the utility of material for impeachment ... would exhaust the\n\npossibilities. In our adversary system, it is enough for judges to judge. The\n\ndetermination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be\n\n                                           12\n\fmade only by an advocate.” Dennis v.

The trial judge had to have\n\nactually reviewed each disk and know which evidence was to be released. When\n\nThe District Attorney in the Appellant‟s case provided the disks to the Court she\n\nleft one out. This last disk was not turned over until right before the victim\n\ntestified.(R.R. Vol 6 p.6)\n\n      The prosecutor consistently though out the trial and on appeal has relied on\n\nTexas Family Code 261.201. She stated on numerous occasions that the\n\ndocuments should not be turned over to the Defendant that the documents were\n\nprotected. The record is clear that the CPS records were contained within the\n\n                                         13\n\fDistrict Attorney‟s file but trial counsel was not allowed to view them. It is further\n\nalleged that the records were sealed and filed in the records of this cause. It is\n\nunknown whether anyone else has ever viewed them.\n\n      In reading the Texas Family Code 261.201 the law was set up to protect the\n\nvictim and the person who was making the report to CPS. It makes no sense to\n\ndeny the records when those facts are known to all parties.\n\n       In a sexual assault trial the child or victim is known to all parties, and the\n\noutcry individual in this case was the person that called CPS. The law is being used\n\nby the State of Texas to deny the individual charged with sexual offenses from\n\naccess to records that may assist in his defense. To allow the State to hide behind\n\nthis statute is not only incorrect but goes against everything that the new discovery\n\nrules are trying to change.\n\n      The rights of defendants charged with sexual offenses in the State of Texas\n\nhas diminished rightfully or wrongfully based on the heinous nature of the crime.\n\nThe legislature has first created a specific crime of continuous sexual assault that\n\ncarries a minimum punishment 25 years in the penitentiary. The law further\n\ndecrees that the heinous nature of the crime requires that those convicted are not\n\nentitled to parole.\n\n      District attorney‟s offices have created special units to prosecute these types\n\n                                          14\n\fof offenses. We must and should protect our children from predators. But in doing\n\nso we also must do so without tromping on the right to a fair and impartial trial.\n\n         When the child is known and the individual making the report is known by\n\nall parties and the records are in the possession of the district attorney what is the\n\npurpose of hiding the documents? Allowing the District Attorney to rely on Texas\n\nFamily Code 261.201 when the victim is known and the individual reporting to\n\nCPS is known it is not logical or productive for the efficient administration of\n\njustice.\n\n         Allegedly all of the CPS documents in Petitioners case have been filed with\n\nthe Court of Appeals. It is unknown if anything in the documents would have been\n\nof use to the Petitioner at trial. The only individuals that have viewed them are the\n\ntrial court, appellate court, CPS personnel, and the district attorney. It should be the\n\ndefendant and his trial counsel who make the determination that the records may or\n\nmay not be of any use to him during the trial not the district attorney and the trial\n\njudge.\n\n         Petitioner is requesting that the Honorable Court of Criminal Appeals allow\n\nthis points of review regarding Texas Family Code 261.201 as it relates to Tex.\n\nCrim. Proc. 39.14. and Texas Family Code 264.408. The issue is not one of how\n\nwas the Petitioner harmed it is one of fundamental fairness. It is the right to cross\n\n                                          15\n\fexamining a witness and the ability to prepare to cross examine the witness in a\n\ntimely and effective manner. It is the right to review of the documents that the\n\nState of Texas intends to use to convict the Petitioner.\n\n                             PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n      WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, appellant prays this\n\nHonorable Court to consider the ground for review raised herein to grant this\n\npetition for discretionary review, and to order a full and complete hearing on the\n\nmerits with briefs.\n\n\n\n                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               /S/Douglas H.

See TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. §§ 21.02, 22.011(a)(2), 21.11(a)(1) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n          A. Initial Statements\n\n          During the weekend of October 2, 2011, C.T.,2 the minor complainant in this case,\n\nwas sleeping over at the home of her friend Chesney St. John (Chesney) and helping to\n\nbabysit Chesney’s younger siblings. At the time, Chesney was sixteen years old and C.T.\n\nwas fourteen years old.3               C.T. confided to Chesney that C.T. needed help telling\n\nsomething to C.T.’s mother, which C.T. evidently found difficult to discuss. Chesney\n\ntestified that C.T. typed a message into the text message function of her phone, showed\n\nChesney what she wished to tell her mother, and then erased it. According to Chesney,\n\nthe message revealed that C.T. was being sexually abused by appellant, her stepfather.\n\nChesney further testified that she learned that the abuse began when C.T. was eight\n\nyears old.         Chesney called her parents, who returned to the house.                      Chesney first\n\nrepeated some of C.T.’s statements to Chesney’s parents because C.T. was crying too\n\nmuch to speak.\n\n          Chesney’s mother, Natalie, questioned C.T. after Chesney finished speaking and\n\ntestified to C.T.’s responses at trial.4 Natalie testified that C.T. stated that appellant forced\n\n\n          1   The State abandoned Count II, aggravated sexual assault of a child, after the close of its case.\n          2C.T. testified under this pseudonym in the trial court. We will continue to refer to her by it in an\neffort to protect her privacy.\n\n          3   Chesney was eighteen years old at the time of the trial.\n          4The trial court certified Natalie as the outcry witness under article 38.072 because she was the\nfirst person older than eighteen years to whom C.T. made a statement about the abuse. See TEX. CODE\n\n                                                         2\n\fher to perform oral sex on him and appellant performed oral sex on C.T. The most recent\n\nabuse occurred one week earlier. C.T. told her that the abuse occurred in her parents’\n\nbedroom on multiple occasions, and on one occasion, appellant attempted to vaginally\n\npenetrate her as she lay naked on the bed but stopped after she curled into a fetal position\n\nand began to cry. Natalie called the San Benito Police Department; she and Chesney\n\naccompanied C.T. to the police station and waited while C.T. gave a statement to Officer\n\nCarlos Andrade.\n\n         B. C.T.’s Statement to Officer Andrade\n\n         Officer Andrade testified that he learned from his interview with C.T. that appellant\n\n“was only touching [C.T.’s] private areas” and that he had not penetrated her with his\n\nfingers or forced her to perform oral sex. However, Officer Andrade further testified that\n\nhe did not determine before conducting the interview whether C.T. understood the terms\n\n“penetration” and “oral sex.” Chesney testified that C.T. did not know the meaning of the\n\nterm “oral sex” until she and C.T. spoke after C.T. gave a statement to Andrade. Chesney\n\ntestified that after explaining the term, she believed that appellant had forced C.T. to\n\nperform oral sex. Andrade also testified that C.T. confirmed that the abuse began when\n\nshe was eight years old. Andrade testified that he felt that there was enough evidence to\n\ndetermine that a crime had been committed and contacted Child Protective Services\n\n(CPS).\n\n         C. Interview with Francisco Lopez\n\n         CPS Investigator Francisco Lopez testified on direct examination that he was\n\nassigned to the case after CPS received reports from Chesney and Natalie and the San\n\n\n\nCRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.072, § 2(a)(3) (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.).\n\n                                                   3\n\fBenito Police. On Sunday, October 3, 2011 (the day after C.T. first spoke to Chesney),\n\nLopez and another CPS investigator went to Chesney and Natalie’s home to interview\n\nC.T. Lopez testified that they would normally bring a child complainant for a forensic\n\ninterview at Maggie’s House, the Children’s Advocacy Center, but it was closed that day.\n\nLopez personally interviewed C.T. and made an audio recording of the interview, which\n\nwe will refer to as the “Lopez Recording.”\n\n       During the interview, C.T. confirmed that the abuse started when she was eight\n\nyears old, that she had recently learned the meaning of the term “oral sex” from Chesney,\n\nthat appellant had forced her to perform oral sex, and that appellant had performed oral\n\nsex on her. C.T. clarified to Lopez that she told Officer Andrade that he did not force her\n\nto perform oral sex because she did not know the meaning of the term until she spoke to\n\nChesney after giving the statement. C.T. also described the specific appearance of\n\nappellant’s genitalia, including whether his pubic hair was shaved or unshaved, that he\n\nhad pimples on his thighs, and that she sometimes saw “red dots” on his genital area.\n\nLopez questioned C.T.’s mother when she arrived to pick up C.T. and testified that C.T.’s\n\nmother gave a similar description of appellant’s genitalia.\n\n       Immediately prior to Lopez’s testimony, appellant’s counsel orally moved for a\n\ncontinuance to review any documents prepared by Lopez during his investigation\n\nbecause the documents “could be pretty voluminous.” The trial court overruled the motion\n\nas premature. At the beginning of cross-examination by appellant’s counsel, Lopez\n\nconfirmed that he had prepared an eight-page report of his investigation, that he used a\n\ncopy of the report to refresh his memory prior to testifying, and that he had not provided\n\nthe report to the State, the trial court, or appellant because it was confidential by law. See\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 261.201 (West, Westlaw through 2013 3d C.S.). Appellant’s\n\ncounsel moved under Texas Rule of Evidence 615 that the court order Lopez to turn over\n\nthe report and orally moved for a continuance to give him time to review the report before\n\nusing it to cross-examine Lopez. See TEX. R. EVID. 615. The trial judge denied both\n\nmotions. At the end of Lopez’s testimony, appellant’s counsel again requested the report.\n\nAppellant’s counsel also filed a written motion for continuance and a motion for disclosure\n\nof confidential records. The trial judge never explicitly ruled on the motions but carried\n\nthem through the trial. The trial judge also ordered the State to tender the CPS files\n\ngenerated in the case to the court under seal. After reviewing the records in camera, the\n\ntrial judge disclosed a copy of Lopez’s eight-page report to the defense and read two\n\nadditional pages into the record.\n\n       D. Lopez’s Interview with B.F.\n\n       Lopez briefly interviewed B.F., C.T.’s younger sister, on the same day as his\n\noriginal interview with C.T. Lopez also made an audio recording of that interview. At trial,\n\nthe State called B.F. as a witness. During the State’s direct examination, B.F. denied that\n\nshe had ever told Lopez that appellant and C.T. were alone “many times” in her parents’\n\nroom with the door closed. The State offered into evidence a portion of the audio\n\nrecording of Lopez’s interview with B.F. that was inconsistent with this testimony. See\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 613. The trial court judge admitted that portion of the statement into\n\nevidence over appellant’s objections. At the end of the State’s examination, B.F. admitted\n\nthat her mother had told her what to say during her trial testimony.\n\n       E. C.T.’s Interview at Maggie’s House\n\n       The day after the initial interviews, Lopez took C.T. for a forensic interview at\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fMaggie’s House. Lopez described C.T.’s interview, which we discuss in detail below, as\n\ncontaining more details, but consistent with C.T.’s prior statements.         Following the\n\ninterview, Detective Manuel Cisneros decided to file charges against appellant.\n\n       F. C.T.’s Testimony\n\n       C.T. testified on direct examination that the first incident of abuse occurred when\n\nshe was eight years old and appellant touched the surface of her vagina with his fingers.\n\nShe remembered at least one other incident of appellant doing similar acts around the\n\nsame time period. C.T. testified that the abuse escalated in “stages.” On subsequent\n\noccasions, appellant would “play with my nipples or my boobs. He’d suck on them or he’d\n\nput his mouth to my vagina.” C.T. further testified that appellant also forced her to perform\n\noral sex on him more than ten times. She testified that appellant actually tried to insert\n\nhis penis into her vagina on two occasions, in contrast to the single incident that she\n\ndescribed to Natalie, Chesney, Officer Andrade, Lopez, and the interviewer at Maggie’s\n\nHouse. C.T. explained that at the time of her initial outcry, her “nerves were running very\n\nthin, and like, I was not thinking fully.”\n\n       C.T. mentioned during direct examination that she gave a statement to Lopez prior\n\nto the interview at Maggie’s House. At the end of the State’s direct examination, appellant\n\nobjected and requested that the court disclose any statements C.T. gave to CPS. After\n\nan in camera review of the sealed CPS files, the trial judge disclosed the existence of two\n\naudio files of C.T.’s interview with Lopez to all parties. The trial judge denied appellant’s\n\nmotion for continuance but gave appellant’s counsel time to listen to the recordings before\n\nproceeding with the trial.5 The State moved on redirect to introduce a portion of the video\n\n\n\n       5   The audio files run approximately twenty-five minutes in total.\n\n                                                      6\n\frecording of C.T.’s interview at Maggie’s House. The State argued that it was admissible\n\nto counteract a false impression of C.T.’s tendency to lie that was left in the jurors’ minds\n\nby counsel’s cross-examination. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(e)(1)(c). The trial court admitted\n\nthat portion of the video over appellant’s objections.\n\n       G. Verdict and Sentence\n\n       Following the close of evidence, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all pending\n\ncounts. Appellant opted for the trial judge to assess his punishment. The trial judge\n\nassessed concurrent sentences of fifty years’ imprisonment on Count I and twenty years’\n\nimprisonment on each of the remaining counts. Appellant filed a motion for new trial, and\n\nthe trial court denied it by written order. Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\n                                 II. MOTIONS FOR CONTINUANCE\n\n       By his first issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his three\n\nmotions for continuance: first, immediately prior to Lopez’s testimony; second, at the\n\nbeginning of his counsel’s cross-examination of Lopez; and third, at the end of his cross-\n\nexamination of Lopez. We disagree.\n\n       A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       We review the trial court’s ruling on a motion for continuance for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Gallo v.

Requests for a\n\ncontinuance after the trial has begun are expressly governed by the code of criminal\n\nprocedure, which provides:\n\n       A continuance or postponement may be granted on the motion of the State\n       or defendant after the trial has begun, when it is made to appear to the\n       satisfaction of the court that by some unexpected occurrence since the trial\n       began, which no reasonable diligence could have anticipated, the applicant\n       is so taken by surprise that a fair trial cannot be had.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fTEX.

Crim.\n\nApp. 1999).\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       Appellant’s first and third motions were unwritten and unsworn and so did not\n\npreserve error for our review. See id. Appellant’s second motion, although in writing and\n\nsworn to by counsel, was insufficient to demonstrate that a continuance was warranted.\n\nA motion for continuance must cite an unexpected occurrence that the applicant’s counsel\n\ncould not have anticipated by reasonable diligence and show that the “applicant is so\n\ntaken by surprise that a fair trial cannot be had.” TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 29.13.\n\nAppellant’s motion cited the reason for the request, to review the CPS records, but did\n\nnot attempt to show that the existence of the audio recording could not have been\n\nanticipated by reasonable diligence. The motion also does not explain why a fair trial\n\ncould not be had without the continuance. See id; Barney v.

Crim. App. 1985) (en banc) (holding that, under article 29.13, “it must appear to the\n\nsatisfaction of the court that ‘a fair trial cannot be had’ before a continuance or\n\npostponement is warranted”). Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the continuance. See Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 764. We overrule appellant’s first\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fissue.\n\n                       III. OBJECTION UNDER TEXAS RULE OF EVIDENCE 615\n\n         By his second issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it refused his\n\nmotion under Texas Rule of Evidence 615 to direct the State to produce a copy of Lopez’s\n\nreport to assist appellant’s counsel in cross-examination. We disagree.\n\n         A.

R. 615(f)(1).\n\nIf the defendant timely moves for production of material covered by Texas Rule of\n\nEvidence 615, it is error for the trial court to deny production and access to it.

App.—Amarillo 1996, no pet.).\n\n         Section 261.201 of the Texas Family Code provides that “reports,” among other\n\nmaterials, “used or developed” in an investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect\n\nmade under chapter 261 are confidential and may not be released. TEX. FAM. CODE ANN.\n\n                                              9\n\f§ 261.201(a). A court may order the release of information made confidential under\n\nsection 261.201 if the following conditions are met: (1) a motion is filed requesting the\n\nrelease of the information; (2) notice of hearing has been served on the investigating\n\nagency and all interested parties; and (3) the court determines after the hearing and an\n\nin camera review of the requested information that disclosure of the requested information\n\nis essential to the administration of justice and is not likely to threaten the life or safety of\n\n(i) a child complainant, (ii) a person who made a report of alleged abuse, or (iii) any person\n\nwho participated in an investigation of abuse or neglect or who provided care for the child.\n\nId. § 261.201(b).\n\n        B. Discussion\n\n        Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to order production of\n\nLopez’s report at the beginning of his trial counsel’s cross-examination of Lopez as\n\nexpressly required by the rule. See TEX. R. EVID. 615. The State responds that the trial\n\ncourt did not err by denying the motion because Lopez’s report was protected under\n\nsection 261.201 of the Texas Family Code, and appellant did not follow the proper\n\nprocedure for gaining access to information protected by that section. See id.; see also\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 261.201. We agree with the State.\n\n        Appellant’s counsel moved for disclosure of the report under Texas Rule of\n\nEvidence 615, but he did not mention Texas Family Code section 261.201 or attempt to\n\ncomply with the procedure for releasing information classified as confidential under that\n\nsection. Because appellant did not attempt to comply at that time with the procedures for\n\nreleasing it,6 we hold the trial court did not err in overruling appellant’s objection under\n\n\n        6 Appellant’s counsel later filed a Motion for Disclosure of Confidential Records seeking access to\nthe entire CPS casefile, which we discuss below. However, appellant does not mention that motion under\n\n                                                   10\n\fTexas Rule of Evidence 615. See TEX. R. EVID. 615.

We disagree.\n\n         A. Applicable Law\n\n         Under United States Supreme Court precedent beginning with Brady, the State is\n\nrequired to disclose evidence known to it that is favorable or material to a defendant’s\n\nguilt or punishment, whether or not the defendant requests it.

A reasonable probability is one that is sufficient to undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome.

Crim. App. 1999). “If the defendant received the material in time to use it\n\neffectively at trial, his conviction should not be reversed just because it was not disclosed\n\nas early as it might have and should have been.” Id.\n\n        B. Discussion\n\n        Appellant asserts that the State’s failure to disclose Lopez’s report and the Lopez\n\nRecording meets the second prong of the test because “C.T. had given numerous\n\nstatements and her credibility was important at the early stage of the trial.” Appellant\n\nreasons that Lopez’s report and the Lopez Recording show a “definite distinction”\n\nbetween the content of C.T.’s original outcry statements and her statements during the\n\ninterview at Maggie’s House. Appellant argues that he should have had access to the\n\nstatements “to sufficiently develop cross-examination of C.T.”7\n\n        We first address the second prong, the requirement that the suppressed evidence\n\nwas favorable. See Harm, 183 S.W.3d at 406. Lopez’s report and the recordings of the\n\nLopez interview do reveal some inconsistencies between C.T.’s original statements to\n\n\n\n\n         7 Appellant also argues that the late disclosure of the audio recording of B.F.’s interview with Lopez\n\nwas Brady error. We hold that appellant has waived error, if any, by failing to request a continuance when\nthe State moved to introduce the recording. See Perez v.

For\n\nexample, on the Lopez Recording, C.T. describes an end date for the abuse closer to the\n\ndate of her outcry than the end date in her statement to the interviewer at Maggie’s House.\n\nC.T. also told the Maggie’s House interviewer that appellant forced her to perform oral\n\nsex on him more than five times, but did not give a specific number of times to Chesney\n\nor Natalie. C.T. also told the Maggie’s House interviewer that appellant attempted to\n\nvaginally penetrate her twice, while she told Lopez that it occurred only once. However,\n\nthe majority of C.T.’s statements on the Lopez Recording are consistent with C.T.’s other\n\nstatements; she consistently described the type of acts appellant would force her to\n\nperform and the type of acts appellant would perform on her. C.T.’s statements are also\n\nconsistent as to the abuse escalating in stages from vaginal touching, to forcing C.T. to\n\nperform oral sex and receiving oral sex from appellant, to one or more incidents where\n\nappellant allegedly tried to penetrate her vaginally with his penis. Moreover, during the\n\nLopez Recording, C.T. explained some of the discrepancies: she told Officer Andrade\n\nthat appellant did not force her to perform oral sex because she did not know the meaning\n\nof the term at the time of the interview. Appellant also asserts that C.T.’s description in\n\nthe Lopez Recording of the identifying features of appellant’s genital area “became an\n\nissue relating to [C.T.’s] credibility,” but Lopez testified that the description of appellant’s\n\ngenital area given by C.T.’s mother was similar to C.T.’s statement. The Lopez Recording\n\nand Lopez’s report, if anything, do more to demonstrate the consistency of C.T.’s\n\nstatements than to cast doubt on them.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence was not favorable to\n\nappellant. Even assuming, arguendo, that the second prong is met, we conclude that the\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fevidence is not material because there is not a reasonable probability that the result of\n\nthe trial would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed earlier. See Ex\n\nparte Reed, 271 S.W.3d at 727. When Brady evidence is disclosed during the trial, we\n\ninquire whether the defendant was able to effectively use the material despite the delay.\n\nSee Little, 991 S.W.2d at 866. Appellant argues that “it is unclear” how his counsel was\n\nsupposed to use Lopez’s report, given that it was only provided at the conclusion of\n\nLopez’s testimony. In fact, after the end of his cross-examination and before recessing\n\nfor the day, the judge asked for Lopez’s phone number and informed him that he was not\n\nreleased from his subpoena and subject to recall the next day. The trial court expressly\n\nafforded appellant’s counsel an opportunity to continue cross-examination of Lopez the\n\nnext day on the basis of the report. If appellant’s counsel wanted to use the report to\n\neffectively cross-examine Lopez, he had the opportunity to do so. Appellant does not\n\nexplain why he did not take the opportunity to recall and cross-examine Lopez the next\n\nmorning, or why he needed to use the information earlier in the cross-examination for it\n\nto be effective.\n\n       Appellant also argues that the audio recordings of C.T.’s interview with Lopez were\n\nmaterial. When denying appellant’s third request for a continuance, this time on the basis\n\nof a need to review the recordings, the trial judge stated on the record that there was no\n\nsubstantive detail in the Lopez Recording that was not included in Lopez’s report, which\n\nhad been disclosed earlier in the trial.8 After reviewing both pieces of evidence, we agree\n\nwith the trial judge. The substance of the report is the same as the substance of the\n\nLopez Recording. Moreover, despite the delayed disclosure, appellant’s counsel’s cross-\n\n\n       8  Two witnesses testified between the disclosure of the report and the beginning of the State’s\ndirect examination of C.T.\n\n                                                  14\n\fexamination of C.T. fills over seventy pages of the reporter’s record and dwells almost\n\nentirely on inconsistencies in C.T.’s multiple statements. Appellant does not explain how\n\na continuance would have enabled his counsel to more effectively use the recordings in\n\nhis cross-examination of C.T.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that appellant is unable to demonstrate that he was\n\nprejudiced by the late disclosure of Lopez’s report and the Lopez Recording. Appellant\n\nis thus unable to demonstrate the third prong of a Brady claim. See Little, 991 S.W.2d at\n\n866. We overrule appellant’s third issue.\n\n                                V. BRADY AND SECTION 261.201\n\n       By his fourth issue, appellant questions the relationship between the State’s duty\n\nto disclose all favorable and material information under Brady and the confidentiality\n\nrequirements of Texas Family Code section 261.201.           We understand appellant as\n\nasserting two arguments under this issue. Appellant’s first argument is that:\n\n       The balancing test as to whether CPS documents should be turned over to\n       the Appellant should not have been placed on the trial court or this Court of\n       Appeals. The State of Texas should play from a point of strength and\n       provide every defendant with the information they intend to use to convict\n       them. The State hid behind the premise that CPS records are privileged\n       information.\n\nAppellant’s second argument is that the trial court abused its discretion by not timely\n\ndisclosing the evidence that was the subject of his third issue.\n\n       We reject appellant’s argument that it was inappropriate for the trial court to\n\nconduct the Texas Family Code section 261.201(b)(3) balancing test to determine\n\nwhether to disclose material that appellant viewed as Brady evidence. The conflict that\n\ncan arise between the State’s need to keep information related to child abuse\n\ninvestigations confidential with a defendant’s need for a fair trial is well recognized. The\n\n                                            15\n\fUnited States Supreme Court confronted the problem in Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, where\n\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that the appropriate method of assessing a claim\n\nthat information made confidential by statute is material under Brady “was to grant [the\n\ndefendant] full access to the disputed information, regardless of the State’s interest in\n\nconfidentiality.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (1987). The United States Supreme Court rejected that\n\nconclusion, holding that the defendant’s interest in “ensuring a fair trial can be protected\n\nfully by requiring that the [state child protection agency] files be submitted only to the trial\n\ncourt for in camera review.” Id. at 60. Addressing a similar Texas statute, which made\n\ninformation given to Crime Stoppers confidential, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nheld that the defendant had the right to require the requested information be tendered to\n\nthe trial court for an in camera review, but rejected the argument that the defendant should\n\nbe accorded unlimited access to that information. Thomas v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1789109\"><a href=\"/opinion/1789109/thomas-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n113–14 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (en banc). The Thomas Court held that “both the State's\n\ninterest and the defendant's interest can be served by providing that crime stoppers\n\ninformation should be inspected by the trial court in camera.” Id. at 114.\n\n       Texas Family Code section 261.201 provides for exactly the type of procedure\n\napproved in Ritchie and Thomas: an in camera inspection of the material by the trial\n\njudge, and an ongoing duty to disclose any confidential material that is relevant or\n\nbecomes relevant during the course of the trial. See Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 60; see also\n\nTEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 261.201. Appellant’s request that this Court “instruct Judges, and\n\nparticularly in Appellant’s case, that the CPS Records were essential to the administration\n\nof justice” runs directly contrary to the balance struck by both the United States Supreme\n\nCourt and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Bound by that precedent, we reject\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fappellant’s argument. See Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 60; Thomas, 837 S.W.2d at 114.\n\n       Regarding appellant’s second argument, he asserts that “[t]he trial court abused\n\nhis discretion in failing to timely turn over the audio tapes and documents to the Appellant.\n\nThe Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel.” The Texas Rules of\n\nAppellate Procedure require that an appellant’s brief “contain a clear and concise\n\nargument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the\n\nrecord.” TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Appellant does not explain his argument further or cite\n\nto any authorities except for the standard of review. We overrule appellant’s second\n\nargument as inadequately briefed. See id. We overrule appellant’s fourth issue.\n\n                                VI.

Discussion\n\n      Appellant argues that the recording of Lopez’s interview with B.F. was improperly\n\nadmitted because the State did not give B.F. the chance to “either admit or deny the\n\ntestimony.” The following exchange occurred between the State and B.F. before the\n\nState offered the audio recording into evidence:\n\n      [State]:      That's okay. Was there ever any time that your dad and [C.T.]\n                    were alone?\n\n      [B.F.]:       No.\n\n      [State]:      No?

Do you remember talking with\n                    someone named Frank from Child Protective Services back\n                    in October at the St. John's house?\n\n      [B.F.]:       Yes.\n\n      [State]:      Yes? And do you remember talking to him and he was asking\n                    you questions?\n\n      [B.F.]:       Yes.\n\n      [State]:      And do you remember that he asked you if you had ever seen\n                    your dad and [C.T.] alone. Do you remember that?\n\n      [B.F.]:       Yes.\n\n      [State]:      And do you remember that you told him that you had seen\n                    them alone?\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f      [B.F.]:       I didn't say that.\n\n      [State]:      You didn't say that?

See TEX. R.

LIMITING INSTRUCTION ON IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE\n\n      Appellant argues by his sixth issue that the court erred by denying his request for\n\na limiting instruction on the audio recording of B.F.’s interview with Lopez. We disagree.\n\n      A. Applicable Law\n\n      Texas Rule of Evidence 105 provides in pertinent part:\n\n      When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but\n      not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the\n      court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and\n\n                                           19\n\f       instruct the jury accordingly; but, in the absence of such request the court's\n       action in admitting such evidence without limitation shall not be a ground for\n       complaint on appeal.\n\nTEX.

Discussion\n\n       When the State offered the recording of B.F.’s interview with Lopez into evidence,\n\nappellant objected on the basis of relevance, optional completeness, and improper\n\nimpeachment of a witness, but, like the defendant in Hammock, did not request a limiting\n\ninstruction until the charge conference.     See id. at 895.    Appellant asserts that his\n\nobjection on the basis of improper impeachment was sufficient to put the trial court on\n\nnotice that a limiting instruction should be given, but provides no support for this\n\nproposition. Appellant, as the party opposing the evidence, had the burden to request a\n\nlimiting instruction at the time the trial court admitted the evidence. See Garcia v.

ADMISSION OF VIDEO FROM MAGGIE’S HOUSE INTERVIEW\n\n       By his seventh issue, appellant argues the trial court erred in admitting the video\n\nrecording of C.T.’s interview at Maggie’s House because it did not meet the requirements\n\nfor admission of prior consistent statements of a witness. See TEX. R. EVID. 801(e)(1)(c).\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence for a clear abuse of discretion,\n\nand we will not reverse as long as the judge’s decision lies within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. McCarty, 257 S.W.3d at 239. We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the trial court’s decision. See Klein, 273 S.W.3d at 304.\n\n       A prior consistent statement of a witness is generally inadmissible except as\n\nprovided by Texas Rule of Evidence 801. TEX. R. EVID. 613(c). Under that rule, a prior\n\nconsistent statement of a witness is admissible if (1) the witness has testified and is\n\nsubject to cross-examination, and (2) the statement is “consistent with the declarant's\n\ntestimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of\n\nrecent fabrication or improper influence or motive.” TEX. R. EVID. 801(e)(1)(c). The trial\n\ncourt has substantial discretion to admit a prior consistent statement even if there has\n\nbeen “only a suggestion of conscious alteration or fabrication.” Hammons v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2356094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2356094/hammons-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804–05 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The rule\n\ndoes not permit courts to admit evidence that would otherwise be hearsay whenever a\n\nwitness’s memory or credibility is challenged, but there is no bright-line rule to distinguish\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fbetween a general challenge to the witness’s memory or credibility and a suggestion of\n\nconscious alteration or fabrication. Id. at 805. The trial court should determine if the\n\ncross-examiner’s questions or the tenor of the questioning would “reasonably imply an\n\nintent by the witness to fabricate.” Id. The implication may be subtle and may come\n\nthrough the “tone, tenor, and demeanor” of the questioning or the cross-examiner. Id. at\n\n808. Reviewing courts, “in assessing whether the cross-examination of a witness makes\n\nan implied charge of recent fabrication or improper motive, should focus on the purpose\n\nof the impeaching party, the surrounding circumstances, and the interpretation put on\n\nthem by the [trial] court.” Id. (brackets and emphasis in the original, internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      B. Discussion\n\n      Two exchanges occurred between appellant’s counsel and C.T. during cross-\n\nexamination. The first exchange referenced inconsistencies between C.T.’s previous\n\nstatements and those she made during her interview at Maggie’s House regarding the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the first incident of abuse:\n\n      [Defense]:    You said you were eight years old?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense]:    The first time it occurred, right?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense]:    You also said it happened in Pittsburgh, Texas?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense]:    Okay. You said you were in the third grade?\n\n      [C.T.]:       Yes, sir.\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f[Defense]:   Okay. It's also true that you said that you're alleging that you\n             were touched on your vagina with the fingers; is that right?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   So you are saying that this happened before your\n             grandmother [name omitted] was going to pick you up for a\n             performance; is that right?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   Okay. And after this occurred your grandmother picked you\n             up; is that right?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   [C.T.], isn't it true that you told the interviewer Monica Galvan\n             at Maggie's House that that was not the first time it occurred?\n             Didn't you give her a different account of the first time it\n             occurred?\n\n[C.T.]:      I corrected myself at the end of the interview.\n\n[Defense]:   You corrected yourself at the end of the interview?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   So that would be in that interview if you corrected yourself at\n             the end of that interview, it would be in that interview that the\n             state has; is that correct?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   Isn't it true that you told the interviewer at Maggie's House the\n             first time it happened was in fact when you did come home\n             sick one day from school?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense]:   Okay. And you'd agree those are two different statements,\n             right? Two different recollections of the first time it occurred?\n\n[C.T.]:      Yes, sir. But I did correct myself at the end of that video\n\n\n\n\n                                    23\n\f         The second exchange referenced inconsistencies between C.T.’s testimony and\n\nher statements at Maggie’s House regarding the time period in which the abuse ceased:\n\n         [Defense]:   All right. You also talked that he would also touch your\n                      breasts; is that right?\n\n         [C.T.]:      Yes, sir.\n\n         [Defense]:   What would he do when he would touch your breast[s]? What\n                      happened then?\n\n         [C.T.]:      He just moved them around or he’d grab his thumb around my\n                      nipples or he’d suck on them.\n\n         [Defense]:   When was the last time that occurred that he ever did that?\n                      Do you remember?\n\n         [C.T.]:      I don’t have an exact date. I don’t remember exactly when.\n\n         [Defense]:   Did you ever give an estimation to anyone as to when that\n                      may have stopped?\n\n         [C.T.]:      No, sir.\n\n         [Defense]:   You never told the interviewer at Monica’s House when it\n                      stopped, at Maggie’s House?\n\n         [C.T.]:      Not that I can remember.\n\n         [Defense]:   You never told her that it stopped before July 4th?\n\n         [C.T.]:      Not that I can remember.\n\n         As appellant reiterated multiple times on appeal, his trial counsel’s overriding\n\nstrategy was to highlight the inconsistencies in C.T.’s various statements to Chesney,\n\nNatalie, Officer Andrade, Lopez, the Maggie’s House interviewer, and her testimony at\n\ntrial.   Trial counsel’s cross-examination of C.T. dwelt almost entirely on various\n\ninconsistencies in her statements. In the selections we quoted above, counsel identified\n\ntwo inconsistencies between the Maggie’s House interview and other statements: C.T.’s\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fdescription of the first incident of abuse and the time period in which it ceased. The trial\n\ncourt evidently interpreted the “tone, tenor, and demeanor” of the questioning as raising\n\na charge of fabrication by commenting that appellant “called the issue of consistency or\n\ninconsistency into issue.” Thus, the purpose of the impeaching party, the surrounding\n\ncircumstances, and the trial court’s interpretation of the questioning all support the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling.   See Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at 808.           Deferring to the trial court’s\n\n“substantial discretion” to admit prior consistent statements after determining that the\n\nwitness’s credibility has been challenged, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\nadmitting the recording. See id. at 804–05\n\n       Appellant presents an additional argument under this issue: even if the State’s\n\ntheory is correct, the tape should not have been admitted into evidence because the State\n\ndid not segregate the admissible portions of the interview from those containing\n\ninadmissible statements. Appellant objected on hearsay grounds, but he did not request\n\nthat the State segregate the inadmissible portions, if any, from what was admissible.\n\nAppellant is correct in his argument that Texas Court of Criminal Appeals precedent is\n\nthat if admissible and inadmissible statements are not segregated the trial judge “may\n\nproperly exclude all of the statements,” but the Court held in the same case cited by\n\nappellant that the “trial court need never sort through challenged evidence in order to\n\nsegregate the admissible from the excludable, nor is the trial court required to admit only\n\nthe former part or exclude only the latter part.” Willover v.

TESTIMONY OF JUSTICE OF THE PEACE DAVID GARZA\n\n       Appellant argues by his ninth issue that the trial court erred by refusing to present\n\nJustice of the Peace David Garza as a witness. Appellant’s counsel requested on the\n\nrecord that the court permit him to call Judge Garza because he wanted to solicit\n\ntestimony regarding why Judge Garza found a probable-cause affidavit submitted by\n\n\n       9   Sonia Eddleman, a trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, did not personally examine C.T., but\ntestified to the contents of C.T.’s medical records after reviewing them.\n\n                                                  26\n\fDetective Cisneros to be insufficient to justify issuing a warrant. The trial judge stated\n\nthat he would not allow Judge Garza to be subject to subpoena “to testify as to his mental\n\nprocess on granting or denying anything.”                Appellant asserts that the court’s ruling\n\nviolated his right to compulsory process to obtain witnesses under the state and federal\n\nconstitutions.

Should a judge be vulnerable to subpoena as to the basis of\n       every action taken by him, the judiciary would be open to frivolous attacks\n       upon its dignity and integrity, and interruption of its ordinary and proper\n       functioning.\n\nUnited States v.

When confronted with an appeal challenging an order\n\nquashing a subpoena of a visiting judge who presided over a portion of the defendant’s\n\ncase, the First Court of Appeals reasoned as follows:\n\n       Texas law has not established circumstances or conditions under which a\n       judicial official might properly be compelled to articulate his reasons for a\n       decision in a particular case, and we do not propose to state such a rule\n       here. However, we conclude that if such a rule were to be established, the\n       better rule would require, at the very least, a threshold showing of improper\n       conduct on the part of the judge that would justify compelling him to testify.\n\nTate, 834 S.W.2d at 570.\n\n       We find the Tate Court’s reasoning to be sound and apply it to the situation before\n\nus. Texas law has not established under what circumstances or conditions a non-\n\n                                              28\n\fpresiding judge or judicial officer may be called to testify about their mental processes,\n\nbut if we were to establish such a rule, it would at least require a threshold showing of\n\nimproper conduct on the part of the judge. See id.; Walker, 860 S.W.2d at 582 (requiring\n\na threshold showing of improper conduct on the part of a judge to justify requiring the\n\njudge to testify regarding his mental processes); see also Sims v. Fitzpatrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1631819\"><a href=\"/opinion/1631819/sims-v-fitzpatrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 n.5 (Tex.

(citing Tate and noting that\n\neven if appellants had preserved their general complaint that the assigned judges erred\n\nin quashing subpoenas issued to the trial judge, they still would have to show the\n\nexistence of extraordinary circumstances). In this case, appellant has made no showing\n\nof improper conduct on the part of Judge Garza or shown any other extraordinary\n\ncircumstance that would justify requiring him to testify. Applying the reasoning of Tate,\n\nwe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit appellant to\n\ncall Judge Garza as a witness. See Tate, 834 S.W.2d at 570.

Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       The following exchange occurred during the State’s redirect examination of\n\nNatalie:\n\n       [State]:      And defense counsel was talking with you about how the\n                     defendant would come over to your house. You said that he\n                     would spend time outside, and you also said that occasionally\n                     when he did [come] into your house you were there, correct?\n                     And defense counsel [sic] said that stated you must be okay\n                     with him being around your children. Is that a correct\n                     statement?\n\n       [Natalie]:    I'm really careful about who’s around my kids. Like did I have\n                     them babysit or babysit my children, to [?]\n\n       [State]:      Would you leave your kids alone with him?\n\n       [Natalie]:    No.\n\n       [State]:      Did they ever stay alone with him?\n\n       [Natalie]:    No.\n\n       [State]:      Did you ever warn your children?\n\n       [Natalie]:    Yes. I told my daughter to—\n\n       [Defense]:    Objection, Your Honor, relevance.\n\n       [State]:      Your Honor, Defense counsel made it clear—\n\n       [Trial Judge]: I’m going to overrule that objection.\n\n       [State]:      You can answer.\n\n       [Natalie]:    I just told my daughter not to be alone with [Appellant] and\n                     especially, well, I told her never to be in the swimming pool\n                     with him.\n\n                                             30\n\f        Appellant’s counsel requested to approach the bench. After a bench conference\n\noff the record, the trial judge held a hearing outside of the presence of the jury to consider\n\nappellant’s renewed objections.11 At the hearing, Natalie testified that her full answer to\n\nthe State’s question would have been that she “had seen inappropriate behavior between\n\nhim and other girls, and between him and my daughter. Just like you would see from a\n\nteen-age boy trying to accidentally cop a feel only he’s a dad.” The trial judge overruled\n\nappellant’s objections but stated that he would allow the State “to go into it very briefly,\n\nbut only very briefly.” The trial judge also instructed that Natalie should not state that\n\nappellant would try to “cop a feel.” The State responded that it would “not go beyond\n\nwhat has already been said.” Natalie testified in the presence of the jury that she did not\n\nwant Chesney to be in the pool with appellant because he “acted like a teen-age boy and\n\nnot like a dad in the pool with the girls.” Natalie further testified that she thought this was\n\n“very inappropriate behavior.”\n\n        Appellant argues that the court’s ruling was error, but we conclude that the error,\n\nif any, was harmless. We review the erroneous admission of evidence concerning\n\nextraneous offenses or bad acts for harm under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure\n\n44.2(b). Casey v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1615721\"><a href=\"/opinion/1615721/casey-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 885 (Tex.

Under this standard, we must disregard the error if, after examining the record\n\nas a whole, we have come to a “fair assurance” that the error did not affect appellant’s\n\n\n\n        11Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 33.1 requires a timely and specific objection to appear in the\nrecord. See Tucker v.

Crim. App. 1999) (en banc) (citing TEX. R. APP. P.\n33.1). Appellant did not renew his objections on the record. However, during the hearing, after Natalie\nanswered the judge’s question regarding what her testimony would have been had appellant’s counsel not\nasked to approach, counsel responded: “Judge, that’s totally [inadmissible] under [Texas Rules of\nEvidence] 402, 403, and 404.” We will treat appellant’s counsel’s statement as a further renewal of his\nobjections that is sufficient to preserve error. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1.\n\n                                                   31\n\fsubstantial rights, see TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2, because it did not influence the jury’s verdict\n\nor had but a slight effect. Casey, 215 S.W.3d at 855. In assessing the likelihood that the\n\njury’s decision was adversely affected by the error, we pay particular attention to factors\n\nsuch as the testimony or physical evidence admitted for the jury’s consideration, the\n\nnature of the evidence supporting the verdict, the character of the alleged error, and how\n\nit may be considered in connection with other evidence in the case. Haley v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1368174\"><a href=\"/opinion/1368174/haley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). We may also consider the jury instructions, the\n\nState’s theories, any defensive theories, closing arguments, voir dire, and the State’s\n\nemphasis on the error. Id. at 518–19.\n\n       After examining the record of the trial as a whole, we conclude that the error, if\n\nany, in admitting this part of Natalie’s testimony did not have a substantial and injurious\n\neffect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict. First, the jury heard substantial\n\ntestimony from Chesney, Natalie, and C.T. regarding appellant’s actions. Second, neither\n\nthe State nor appellant emphasized this portion of Natalie’s testimony. Third, the alleged\n\nerror did not affect appellant’s defensive theory, which was to call into question the\n\ntruthfulness of C.T.’s statements as a whole. Given the miniscule part that Natalie’s\n\ntestimony played in the State’s case and the State’s lack of emphasis on it, the jury likely\n\ngave it little weight in comparison to the other evidence before it. See id. at 518. Based\n\non the whole record of the trial, if there was an error in admitting this portion of Natalie’s\n\ntestimony, it did not have a substantial or injurious effect or influence in determining the\n\njury’s verdict. See Casey, 215 S.W.3d at 855. We overrule appellant’s tenth, eleventh,\n\nand twelfth issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\f                    XII. COMMENTS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE AND PROSECUTOR\n\n       By his thirteenth and fourteenth issues, appellant argues that the trial judge and\n\nthe State committed fundamental error by making improper comments during voir dire.\n\nTo preserve a complaint of improper voir dire for appellate review, a party must make a\n\ntimely and specific objection and receive an adverse ruling from the trial court.

Crim. App. 2007); TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1. Here, because\n\nappellant did not object, he has waived his complaint on appeal except for fundamental\n\nerror. See Archie, 221 S.W.3d at 699; McLean v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1464755\"><a href=\"/opinion/1464755/mclean-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 915 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n       A. Standard for Fundamental Error\n\n       The applicable test for determining whether an error during voir dire is\n\nfundamental, and therefore may be raised for the first time on appeal, is whether the error\n\ninvolves a violation of a right that is “waivable only” or a denial of an absolute, systemic\n\nrequirement. Aldrich v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1616166\"><a href=\"/opinion/1616166/aldrich-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 895 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). This Court\n\nhas held in the past that the right to an impartial judge is an absolute, systemic\n\nrequirement that may be raised for the first time on appeal if the judge’s comments are\n\n“so egregious as to deem the judge biased.” Hernandez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488117\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488117/hernandez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185–\n\n86 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2008, no pet.).\n\n       B. Discussion\n\n       Appellant argues here that the trial judge commented on the evidence and shifted\n\nthe burden of proof by saying in reference to the State’s burden that: “[i]t's not a problem.\n\nYou wouldn't be here if they didn't think they could prove it . . . .” However, we evaluate\n\na judge’s comments in the context of the record as a whole. See Lopez v. State, 415\n\n\n\n                                             </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.). The trial judge’s full remarks\n\nare as follows:\n\n       [The prosecutors] have the burden of proving the guilt and that burden never\n       switches. It's a burden that they welcome. It's not a problem. You wouldn't\n       be here if they didn't think they could prove it, however, whether they prove\n       it or not is something that you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       Read in context, the trial judge’s remarks did not shift the burden of proof away\n\nfrom the State. The trial judge specifically reiterated that the State bears the burden of\n\nproof and that the jury is the sole judge of whether the State succeeded in proving its\n\ncase beyond a reasonable doubt.             We hold that appellant has not demonstrated\n\nfundamental error because he has not shown that the judge’s comments were so\n\negregious as to deem him biased. See Hernandez, 268 S.W.3d at 185–86.\n\n       With regard to the prosecutor’s comments, appellant has not directed us to any\n\nauthority that improper arguments or comments during voir dire by a party, as opposed\n\nto the trial judge, rise to the level of fundamental error. However, by arguing the State\n\nshifted the burden of proof, appellant’s argument could be interpreted as going to the\n\nabsolute, systemic requirement that a person may only be found guilty of an offense if a\n\nrational trier of fact finds sufficient evidence to prove all of the elements of the offense\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See In re Winship, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362–64 (1970). Assuming,\n\nwithout deciding, that arguments by the State during voir dire shifting the burden of proof\n\nmay rise to the level of fundamental error, we will address appellant’s claims that the\n\nState’s comments shifted the burden of proof to appellant in the interests of justice.12\n\n\n\n\n       12 The Amarillo Court adopted this approach when faced with a similar claim. See Huff v. State,\nNo. 07-10-00174-CR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4828491</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Nov. 29, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op., not\ndesignated for publication).\n\n                                                 34\n\f       Appellant cites the following portions of the State’s voir dire in support of his\n\nargument that the State shifted the burden of proof to appellant:\n\n       Without you our system would fall apart. The bottom line is we can have a\n       case and it can have law enforcement that goes out to the scene, there can\n       be child protective services involved, we can have forensic interviewers, we\n       can have medical examiners, we can have prosecutors, we can have\n       investigators, but it wouldn't be anything without you because at the end of\n       the day we can bring the case to you that we believe we can prove beyond\n       a reasonable doubt but if you guys don't go there with us, if you don't sit and\n       listen to it, we've all done it in vain.\n\n       Shortly afterwards, during voir dire, the prosecutor stated:\n\n       Sexual abuse of children is a very conflicting topic. It's polarizing. People\n       don't want to hear about it. Raise your card if you know right now you don't\n       want to hear about it. So almost everybody. Raise them high. Keep them\n       up please, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and it goes on and on and on.\n       The truth is I don't blame you. When I started as a prosecutor, I didn't want\n       to hear about it either. But the truth is if everybody had a strong reaction to\n       child abuse didn't sit on jury panels, if that was a reason for you to be\n       excused from jury duty today, then either we wouldn't be able to have these\n       trials because there wouldn't be anybody to hear them or the people, worse,\n       the people that heard them would be people who didn't get emotional about\n       child abuse and what a tragedy that would be.\n\n       In the first quoted portion of voir dire, the State emphasized that the role of the jury\n\nis important and that the State believed that it could carry its burden of proving its case\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Before voir dire began, the trial judge emphasized that the\n\nburden of proof rests with the State to prove all elements of the charged offenses beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, and the jury charge reflected that fundamental requirement. In the\n\nsecond quoted portion, read in context, the prosecutor merely mentions how\n\nuncomfortable many people feel at the thought of sexual abuse of children and asks the\n\nmembers of the venire to refrain from seeking not to serve because they might feel\n\nuncomfortable hearing the evidence in this case. We find nothing in either argument that\n\nshifts the burden of proof to the defense or asks jurors to convict on the basis of the jurors’\n\n                                              35\n\femotional repugnance for child abuse rather than the evidence presented in the State’s\n\ncase. We hold that State’s comments do not rise to the level of fundamental error. See\n\nAldirch, 104 S.W.3d at 895. We overrule appellant’s thirteenth and fourteenth issues.\n\n                                XIII. CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n       By his fifteenth issue, appellant argues that the cumulative effect of all of the errors\n\nraised in his other issues requires reversal. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has\n\nobserved that “[i]t is conceivable that a number of errors may be found harmful in their\n\ncumulative effect,” but there is no authority that “non-errors may in their cumulative effect\n\ncause error.” Chamberlain v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1501169\"><a href=\"/opinion/1501169/chamberlain-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (en\n\nbanc). Because we have found no error in all but one of appellant’s issues and here\n\nconcluded that that error, if any, was harmless, there is no cumulative error requiring\n\nreversal. See id.; Gallegos v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2538775\"><a href=\"/opinion/2538775/gallegos-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 805 (Tex.
