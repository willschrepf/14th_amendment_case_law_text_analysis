Appellant raises\n\nten issues for our consideration. We affirm the trial court’s order denying the\n\nmotion to recuse, and we affirm the trial court’s modification order in part and\n\nreverse and remand the order in part for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\f                           FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Appellant M. and the children’s mother, appellee W., 1 divorced on October\n\n27, 2008. In 2010, M. filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship. In his\n\npetition, M. sought appointment as sole managing conservator of the children or,\n\nalternatively, appointment as joint managing conservator with the right to\n\ndetermine the children’s primary residence, as well as child support from W. M.\n\ncontended that W. had attempted to alienate him from the children, parented the\n\nchildren inappropriately, failed to provide proper medical care for the children,\n\nfailed to co-parent the children with him, and that W. suffered from Munchausen\n\nsyndrome by proxy, “otherwise known as a histrionic personality disorder.”\n\nAccording to M., W. had falsely insisted to mental health professionals and school\n\nofficials that J.D.M. and D.M.M. suffered from Asperger’s syndrome. The judge of\n\nthe 279th District Court, where the divorce action was litigated, eventually recused\n\nhimself from the case, and the case was reassigned to the 252nd District Court,\n\nalthough the appellate record does not reflect the precise means by which the\n\nreassignment was accomplished.\n\n      W. filed a counter-petition, in which she sought appointment as sole\n\nmanaging conservator of the children and contended that “[t]he parties have been\n\n      1\n        To protect the children’s privacy, we will refer to the appellant as “M.” and\nto the appellee as “W.”\n                                          2\n\funable to communicate in a manner conducive to joint managing conservatorship.”\n\nW. asserted that M. had exposed the children to hostility and alienation against her\n\nby filing “constant and continuing litigation[,]” contacting law enforcement\n\nofficers despite the lack of an emergency, having trespass and cease and desist\n\nwarnings issued that forbade W. from his residence, “mounting a letter[-]writing\n\ncampaign to medical and psychological providers for the children accusing her of\n\nharming the children[,]” sending private emails between the parties to other\n\nindividuals, and causing a complaint to be made against W. with the Texas\n\nDepartment of Family and Protective Services (“CPS”). W. further alleged that M.\n\nhad demonstrated an inability to maintain a positive relationship with her “that is\n\nconducive to joint managing conservatorship,” exposed the children to the\n\novernight stays of his sexual partners, and “exposed the children to unknown and\n\nunchecked individuals during the operation of another’s business” in his residence.\n\nW. requested that M. exercise possession and access pursuant to the standard\n\npossession order “if and only if recommended by the court[-]appointed mental\n\nhealth professionals[.]”\n\n      The custody case was tried to the bench in January 2012. According to M.,\n\nthe trial judge sent M. and W. to Dr. Michelle Douget, who advised the trial court\n\nthat M. and W. should cooperate and agree regarding the treatment of the children\n\n                                         3\n\fand recommended that M. and W. have psychological testing for personality traits,\n\nas well as participate in ongoing therapy. M. testified that Douget found he did not\n\nsuffer from any mental abnormalities.\n\n      Clinical psychologist Dr. Dan Roberts testified the trial judge asked him to\n\nevaluate M. and W., and that he interviewed both M. and W. for several hours and\n\nasked them to complete two personality inventories. Roberts also testified that he\n\nreviewed a report from Dr. Timothy Bohan, who the trial court had previously\n\nappointed as an expert to evaluate the children. 2 Roberts also testified that he\n\ntalked to all three of the children, spoke to several people about M. and W., and\n\nreviewed the children’s medical, pharmacy, counseling, school, and other records.\n\nRoberts also spoke to two of the children’s teachers.\n\n      Roberts recommended that the trial court consider increasing M.’s\n\npossession time with the children, and he explained that the two older children\n\nwanted more time with their father. Roberts also recommended that the court\n\nconsider appointing a parenting facilitator rather than a parenting coordinator\n\nbecause a facilitator is permitted to testify concerning the parents’ progress, which\n\n\n      2\n        Although the trial court stated that it did not intend to consider any of the\nopinions Bohan offered with respect to M. or W., the trial court cited Bohan’s\nreport as evidence in support of its findings of fact. In the report, Bohan stated that\nhe found some of M.’s responses during the evaluation troubling and indicative of\nunusual thought processes.\n                                          4\n\fwould allow the case to proceed and expose the children to less conflict. In\n\naddition, Roberts testified that prior to the divorce, M. had suffered a bout of major\n\ndepression, during which he was delusional. According to Roberts, M. is capable\n\nof making medical and educational decisions for the children “up to a point[,]” but\n\nRoberts explained, “I’m not certain that that’s a capacity or a willingness that is\n\nstable based on his history.” Roberts stated that M. “should have a voice” in\n\nmaking such decisions.\n\n      In Roberts’s psychological assessment of M., which was based upon his\n\nexamination of M. on November 16, 2011, and was introduced into evidence, he\n\nconcluded that M. had no “significant current problems” with depression, anxiety,\n\npsychosis, stress management, or anger management, and that M. was currently\n\nparticipating in counseling to help him manage stress. Roberts later noted in his\n\nassessment that M. was “experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression\n\nassociated with the aftermath of his divorce and his concern about the children’s\n\nwelfare[,]” and that M. had “obsessive tendencies, competitiveness, unusual ideas,\n\nand a degree of inflexibility under stressful conditions.” Roberts’s assessment\n\nconcluded that “[o]n the whole [M.] appears to be a capable and concerned\n\nparent.”\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      At the conclusion of the custody trial, the trial court issued temporary orders\n\nawarding W. the exclusive right to consent to medical, dental, psychiatric, and\n\npsychological treatment for the children, as well as the exclusive right to make\n\ndecisions concerning their educational needs, and ordered that M. “will not have\n\nany contact with any teacher or medical provider or evaluator.” In a second order,\n\nthe trial court ordered that M. and W. would remain joint managing conservators of\n\nthe children, a behavior plan should be developed for D.M.M. through the public\n\nschool district, any appropriate therapy for D.M.M. shall begin immediately, the\n\nparties shall not publicly discuss the children’s medical issues except with medical\n\nproviders or teachers, and the parties shall not discuss medical issues with the\n\nchildren. The trial court further ordered that M. would have possession of the\n\nchildren pursuant to the expanded standard possession order “as set out in the\n\nTexas Family Code[,]” A.K.M. and J.D.M. shall have one extra overnight with M.\n\nif they so choose, the parties shall utilize an internet calendaring system with the\n\namicus attorney for the children’s extracurricular activities, and both M. and W.\n\nshall participate separately in therapy. The trial court set the cause for final hearing\n\non June 4, 2012.\n\n       In April 2012, M. filed an emergency motion for protection and\n\nappointment of an attorney ad litem, in which he alleged that A.K.M. had made an\n\n                                           6\n\foutcry of sexual abuse against W., and the trial court conducted an emergency\n\nhearing on the motion on April 10 and 11, 2012. At the emergency hearing, M.\n\ntestified that he had been exercising visitation with the children since the trial\n\ncourt’s temporary orders, and he described A.K.M as “in a state of full[-] scale\n\nmeltdown” and indicated that A.K.M.’s grades were poor and she was very angry\n\nwith her mother and grandmother. According to M., A.K.M. indicated that she\n\nwanted to live with her father, and “she’s afraid to go back to her mother’s.” M.\n\ntestified that J.D.M. was also angry that since the temporary orders were entered,\n\nM. had not been participating in his schooling, and he also testified that D.M.M.\n\nwas regressing with potty training.\n\n      M. explained that A.K.M.’s condition had deteriorated significantly during\n\nthe last month, and she had been “near hysterical[.]” According to M., A.K.M.\n\nmade an outcry of sexual abuse against W. to M.’s girlfriend B., and A.K.M. then\n\ncontinued her outcry to M. M. testified that he had not suspected any abuse and\n\nwas shocked by it. M. explained that he took A.K.M. to the police department, and\n\nA.K.M. wrote a statement. M. subsequently received a call from Detective Mark\n\nHoge, who asked M. to bring B. and A.K.M. to the police station. M. testified that\n\nA.K.M. was interviewed for about two and a half hours, and the investigating\n\nofficer also interviewed M. and B. According to M., both Detective Hoge and\n\n                                        7\n\fSarah Miller from the Lufkin CPS office told M. that CPS would arrive at noon to\n\ndo a Priority One removal and have the children professionally interviewed. M.\n\ntestified that he wanted the trial court to make him “sole managing conservator\n\nwith all powers” during the pendency of the investigation, and that W. have no\n\nvisitation during that time.\n\n       The trial court asked the amicus attorney to contact Detective Hoge and\n\nMiller. The trial judge personally questioned both Hoge and Miller on the record\n\nafter they were sworn, and both Hoge and Miller denied telling M. that CPS\n\nintended to remove the children. The trial judge then announced his intention to\n\ninterview A.K.M. with a court reporter present, and the record reflects that the trial\n\njudge extensively interviewed A.K.M., who was thirteen years old at the time, in\n\nchambers. The reporter’s record of the interview encompasses seventy-nine pages.\n\nThe time stamps in the record of the hearing, although less than a model of clarity,\n\nreflect that the interview apparently began at 1:18 p.m. and continued until 2:44\n\np.m.\n\n       When M. returned to the stand, W.’s counsel asked the court to admonish M.\n\nof “his Fifth Amendment rights for perjury.” W.’s counsel asked M. if he testified\n\nthat CPS and the police told him that the children were going to be removed, and\n\nM. testified, “[o]bviously I misspoke or misunderstood” and was “in error.” M.\n\n                                          8\n\ftestified that he was on medication for weight loss and acid reflux, but was not\n\nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol. M. testified that he thought he recalled\n\nDetective Hoge telling him the case would be treated as a Priority One, but that his\n\nmemory was apparently incorrect, and he attributed his faulty recollection to the\n\nfear he had experienced since A.K.M.’s outcry.\n\n      W.’s counsel asked M. whether he had discussed the case with K., a blogger\n\nwho M. (an attorney) represents, and M. responded that he had done so, but not in\n\ndetail, and M. indicated that he feared K.’s issues with the trial judge would be\n\ntaken out on M. M. testified that he had told A.K.M. to tell the truth when she\n\nspoke to the trial judge. W.’s counsel asked M. whether he had anything to do\n\nwith “reports in various newspapers and news media . . . about what a bad judge . .\n\n. Layne Walker is[,]” and M. denied having any involvement with those reports or\n\ntelling his children that the judge was bad, crazy, or mean. M. testified that he\n\nshowed the children one of the trial court’s temporary orders because they were\n\nupset because he was not attending parent-teacher conferences. M. denied asking a\n\nlocal reporter to publish a story concerning W.’s alleged romantic relationship with\n\na political figure, but M. admitted that he had discussed the alleged relationship\n\nwith the reporter. M. testified that he took A.K.M. on an overnight trip to “have\n\nsome fun, to put it out of her mind” after A.K.M. made the outcry. M. denied\n\n                                         9\n\fscheduling the trip as a reward. M. also explained that he “was concerned if [the\n\noutcry] was fabrication that [A.K.M.] needed substantial help.” M. testified that he\n\nhad repeatedly asked A.K.M. whether she was sure her allegations were true, and\n\ntold her not to say things just because she wanted to live with him. At the\n\nconclusion of the day’s testimony, the trial judge also announced that the record of\n\nhis interview with A.K.M. was sealed and “nobody will ask for a copy of it\n\nbecause you are not going to get it.”\n\n      M. was not present when the proceedings resumed the next morning. M.’s\n\ncounsel objected to going forward without M. but did not otherwise object to the\n\namicus attorney testifying. The amicus attorney, Raquel West, testified that she\n\nhad served as an amicus attorney in the case for approximately ten months, and she\n\nhad interacted with the children, M., and W. on many occasions.\n\n      According to West, M. called her because he believed he could not attend\n\none of J.D.M.’s school activities, and West advised M. “that was not the order or\n\nthe spirit of the order of the Court[,]” and she testified that she had also spoken\n\nwith the trial judge about the issue, and West advised M. that the only restriction\n\nhe had was “contacting teachers and medical providers.” West testified that M.\n\nindicated he understood, and M. attended the activity. West explained that she\n\nheard M.’s testimony that he believed he could not be involved with the children’s\n\n                                        10\n\fschooling, including reading, proofing, or approving their homework, and West\n\ntestified that she found M.’s testimony incredible and “quite disturbing.”\n\nAccording to West, J.D.M. and A.K.M. had both been exercising their right to\n\nhave an additional day with their father, and A.K.M. “is doing really poorly in\n\nschool in several subjects, not just one.”\n\n      West testified that she heard M. say that he was not helping or following\n\nthrough with checking whether A.K.M. had homework, and West stated, “I truly\n\nbelieve he was potentially trying to sabotage her school and her grades in an effort\n\nto show that because [W.] got the educational decision-making that he could . . .\n\nshow . . . how poorly [A.K.M.] has done.” West also explained that M.’s testimony\n\nabout the children being upset about the trial court’s ruling confused her “because\n\nthey actually got what they wanted and that was an extra day with their dad.” West\n\nopined that the children should not have seen a change in their daily lives, and that\n\nit was inappropriate for M. to leave a court order out for them to read.\n\n      West testified, “I find . . . that these children are damaged because of him. I\n\nthink they are continuing to be damaged even more so since the order. He is taking\n\nout his frustrations in a very conniving way on these children.” In addition, West\n\nopined that M. has permanently changed the direction of A.K.M.’s life, and she\n\nrecommended that A.K.M. have intensive psychotherapy. West testified that\n\n                                             11\n\fA.K.M. has been “brainwashed to some extent” and that M. taught her “to be\n\nmanipulative to get what you want.” West also opined that most of A.K.M.’s\n\noutcry was false and was promoted by M. West opined that with respect to\n\nA.K.M., “any access to her father needs to be extremely limited and probably\n\nsupervised.” West further opined that all of the children could deteriorate under the\n\ncircumstances. West testified that A.K.M. is willing to sacrifice herself to protect\n\nher father.\n\n      M. arrived during cross-examination of West. When M. retook the stand for\n\nadditional cross-examination, he explained that he passed out on the stand the\n\nprevious day and did not have full memory of everything that occurred. M.\n\nexplained that taking weight loss medication, only eating a breakfast bar all day,\n\nand dehydration contributed to an anxiety attack. M. denied telling A.K.M. “to do\n\nthis[;]” i.e., make an outcry. M. testified, “I always thought from the beginning,\n\n2008, that there would be a relentless attempt to terminate my rights.” When asked\n\nwhether he contacted K. after leaving the courtroom, M. responded that K. visited\n\nhim at the hospital, and that he spoke with K. that morning and told him he was\n\nscared. M. testified that he did not believe he committed perjury and did not\n\nintentionally lie. When asked whether he should have control of the children when\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fhe is under such distress that he was not in control of his faculties, M. testified, “As\n\nI sit here right now, no, I’m too upset.”\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated as follows:\n\n             I just want an entire copy of this transcript turned over to the\n      Jefferson County District Attorney’s office and I want Mr. Maness to\n      have his staff or whoever he chooses to review this for perjury and/or\n      aggravated perjury. I do claim to be an expert in that area, but I am\n      not going to make that decision. If Mr. Maness’s Grand Jury is not\n      willing to take a look at it[,] I will be willing to convene a special\n      Grand Jury for the sole purpose of taking a look at this.\n             . . . I am going to order [M.] to cease and desist from relying on\n      hearsay in his life.\n\n           . . . [M.] will have no contact with these children of any nature\n      whatsoever until further order of the Court.\n\n      On April 11, 2012, the trial court signed a temporary order that removed the\n\nchildren from both M. and W., forbade M. and W. from having contact with the\n\nchildren, and temporarily appointed the children’s maternal grandmother as their\n\nsole managing conservator. On April 19, 2012, the trial court signed an order\n\ndenying M.’s motion for protective order and appointment of an attorney ad litem.\n\nIn that order, the trial court found that M.’s “acts and manipulations . . . have\n\nplaced all of the children at immediate and significant risk of danger to their\n\nphysical and emotional welfare and caused the children to be in immediate danger\n\nin [his presence].” The court further found that M. had not acted in the children’s\n\nbest interest, and that the children’s present circumstances would significantly\n                                            13\n\fimpair their physical health and emotional welfare. The trial court removed all\n\nthree children from M.’s custody and presence “for the children’s own protection.”\n\nAdditionally, the order provided that the provisions in the temporary order of April\n\n10 with regard to W. would remain “until confirmation has been received by this\n\nCourt that [CPS] ha[s] ruled out the allegations of abuse against [W.].”\n\nFurthermore, the trial court ordered that upon receipt of such confirmation, W.\n\n“shall have unlimited and unrestricted possession and access of the children subject\n\nof this suit.”\n\n       On April 18, 2012, the trial court held a hearing on W.’s motion to enter\n\norders. The hearing was scheduled because M. had filed a petition for writ of\n\nmandamus with this Court after the hearing on the emergency motion, and the\n\npurpose of the hearing apparently was to provide this Court with an order to review\n\nin the mandamus proceeding. M. was not present at the hearing. At the hearing,\n\nM.’s counsel acknowledged that the amicus had sent a letter stating that CPS and\n\nthe police did not intend to proceed with any allegations of abuse against W. The\n\ntrial judge stated,\n\n       I want to make sure that the record is clear as well. . . .\n       Correspondence that has been made or phone calls that have been\n       made has been from the investigating authorities to the Court. I have\n       not been involved in constant conversation. . . . [A]t no time has the\n       Court involved itself in the investigation.\n\n                                        14\n\fAt one point during the proceedings, when W.’s counsel and the trial judge were\n\nquestioning M.’s counsel about the basis for his objections to the proposed order,\n\nthe following exchange occurred between M.’s counsel, W.’s counsel, and the trial\n\njudge:\n\n         [W.’s counsel]:    Did you hear . . . [M.]’s response to the question\n         when I asked him if he was capable of taking care of the children and\n         on the second day he said he wasn’t capable of taking care of himself\n         right now and no, he wasn’t capable of taking care of the children?\n\n         [M.’s counsel]:     I heard him say at this point at this time, which is\n         [with] reference to his present condition.\n\n         [W.’s counsel]:     So, now, you are making the objection to the Court\n         that there was no evidence upon which the Judge can base the ruling\n         that the children shouldn’t be around [M.] for their own protection?\n\n         [M.’s counsel]:    Because he was not capable of taking care of the\n         children at that point is not grounds for taking away the children\n         permanently from him, which this paragraph does.\n\n         THE COURT:         Can I just ask for my protection, is there anything\n         now in the record that suggests otherwise?\n\n         [M.’s counsel]:    That the children should not be taken away?\n\n         THE COURT:         The only evidence that I have before me is [M.]\n         saying that he is not in a position to take care of them. [M.] has\n         voluntarily absen[t]ed himself from the proceeding today. . . . Is there\n         anything in the record from the day he testified to that that has\n         changed?\n\nM.’s counsel objected “to being put under examination.”\n\n\n                                           15\n\f      W.’s counsel’s examination of M.’s counsel continued on for dozens of\n\npages of the reporter’s record, and the trial judge also made comments to M.’s\n\ncounsel and questioned M.’s counsel during the examination. The trial judge also\n\ncommented that he believed M. made a false report of abuse and “spent an\n\nextended period of time brainwashing [A.K.M.] and spending days rewarding her\n\nfor her conduct. . . . [U]nder section 153.013 I find that [M.] definitely made a\n\nfalse report of abuse. He encouraged it. He assisted it.”\n\n      In June 2012, M. filed a motion to recuse the trial judge. M. asserted in the\n\nmotion that the trial judge’s impartiality “may reasonably be questioned.” See Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1). Specifically, M. contended that after the custody trial in\n\nJanuary 2012, K. had published articles which were critical of the trial judge and\n\nhad filed a complaint against the trial judge with the State Commission on Judicial\n\nConduct. M. complained in the motion to recuse that the trial court ordered that\n\nneither M. nor W. have access to the children, “even though there was no\n\ncomplaint filed against [M.] and no affirmative relief asking that [M.] be denied\n\naccess to the children.” In addition, M. complained that the trial judge had ex parte\n\ncommunications, and he pointed to, among other things, the trial court’s comment\n\nat the April 18, 2012, hearing that “It’s been reported to me that since [A.K.M.]\n\nhas been returned that she’s making great strides. Her grades are back in order.\n\n                                          16\n\fEverything is in good shape.” M. also complained of the trial judge’s sealing of\n\nthe record of his interview with A.K.M., as well as the judge permitting W.’s\n\ncounsel to call the amicus attorney as a witness to testify about “highly contested\n\nissues.” In addition, M. alleged that although no complaint had been filed against\n\nM. and no affirmative relief had been requested concerning denying M. access to\n\nthe children, the trial judge sua sponte ordered that neither W. nor M. have access\n\nto the children.\n\n      On June 26, 2012, Judge Olen Underwood conducted a hearing on M.’s\n\nmotion to recuse. M.’s counsel testified that the trial judge summoned an attorney\n\nfor the City of Beaumont to bring the investigative report concerning A.K.M.’s\n\noutcry to chambers, but never made the file part of the record. In addition, M.’s\n\ncounsel testified that during the first day of the hearing, the trial judge commented\n\nto Miller and Hoge about the chance they had to “visit in [c]hambers,” and only the\n\ntrial judge questioned Miller and Hoge; the attorneys were not permitted to do so.\n\nM.’s counsel also testified that communications occurred between the trial judge,\n\nHoge, and Miller on the second day of trial “either by way of telephone or text.”\n\nAccording to M.’s counsel, the trial judge also received a telephone call from W.’s\n\nmother, and the Court invited the parties to listen to his side of the conversation,\n\nbut the parties could not hear what W.’s mother was saying.\n\n                                         17\n\f      M.’s counsel also testified concerning the trial judge’s statements that he\n\nintended to refer the matter to the District Attorney’s office to determine whether\n\nM. had committed perjury or aggravated perjury and that he would convene his\n\nown special grand jury if the District Attorney’s office declined to investigate M.\n\nAccording to counsel, no party had testified that M. had encouraged A.K.M. to\n\nmake false allegations of sexual abuse against W., nor was there any documentary\n\nevidence so indicating.\n\n      M.’s counsel testified that at the April 18 hearing on entry of orders, he was\n\non the stand for approximately three hours, and both the trial judge and opposing\n\ncounsel “aggressively questioned” him concerning a petition for writ of mandamus\n\nhe had filed. M.’s counsel testified that a “pervasive bias . . . occurred in that\n\nhearing and questioning of me and to the point of insulting me, insulting my client,\n\nstating that getting the truth out of me was as difficult as extracting a molar without\n\nNovocaine. On numerous occasions saying that [M.] is not capable of telling the\n\ntruth.”\n\n      M.’s counsel also testified that the trial judge “repeatedly approached\n\n[A.K.M.] trying to get her to recant her testimony” during the in-chambers\n\ninterview, and he explained that even after opposing counsel pointed out that\n\npursuant to statute, an in-chambers interview of the child shall be made a part of\n\n                                          18\n\fthe record, the trial judge still declined to provide the transcript of the interview\n\nand instead sealed it. Counsel testified that A.K.M. never recanted her statements\n\nduring the April interview.\n\n      K. testified that he owns a political consulting group that publishes an\n\ninternet periodical. When M.’s counsel asked him whether he had published\n\nanything on the internet that was critical of the trial judge, W.’s counsel objected\n\non the grounds of relevancy, and Judge Underwood sustained the objection. M.’s\n\ncounsel asked K. whether he had filed a complaint against the trial judge with the\n\nJudicial Commission, and Judge Underwood again sustained W.’s counsel’s\n\nrelevancy objection despite M.’s counsel’s argument that “animosity between [K.]\n\nand . . . Judge Layne Walker has created a problem in our case because the Judge\n\nperceives [M.] as being a close friend of [K.].”\n\n      Miller testified that she had a conversation with the trial judge to which she\n\nand the trial judge were the only participants. According to Miller, the trial judge\n\nasked her if she was investigating the case, and then she answered the same\n\nquestion again when he posed it to her under oath in the courtroom. M.’s counsel\n\nrested at the conclusion of Miller’s testimony. Judge Underwood denied the\n\nmotion to recuse.\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f      On September 14, 2012, W. filed a “request for additional relief in light of\n\nevidence since the date of trial and brief in support[.]” In her request, W. discussed\n\nM.’s testimony at the emergency hearing concerning A.K.M.’s outcry and his\n\ntestimony that CPS had told him a removal of the children was imminent, as well\n\nas the CPS caseworker’s testimony that CPS had not told M. that a removal was\n\nimminent. W. also pleaded that CPS had ruled out the alleged abuse by W., and\n\nshe contended that “evidence was introduced that would lead a reasonable person\n\nto believe [M.] had encouraged and facilitated [A.K.M.] into making allegations . . .\n\nof sexual abuse” against W.\n\n      W. pointed the trial court to this Court’s opinion in the mandamus\n\nproceeding, in which we held that “the trial court heard evidence from which the\n\ncourt could reasonably conclude that the order [changing custody] was necessary\n\nto prevent significant impairment of the children’s physical health and emotional\n\ndevelopment.” 3 In re M., No. 09-12-00179-CV, 2012 WL 1808236, at *3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont May 17, 2012, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). W. asserted that\n\nthe trial court “should recognize a need for continued emotional healing for these\n\nchildren and need for a progressive, gradual return of an aggressively healed and\n\n\n      3\n       The order before this Court in the mandamus proceeding was the trial\ncourt’s initial order that provided neither parent could have contact with the\nchildren, not the order from which M. now appeals.\n                                         20\n\fhealthy father into their lives and minds.” W. requested “the Court to consider the\n\nchildren, who . . . experienced this hostile drama . . . for at least the past five years\n\nof their young lives. Five years of rancid feelings carried in the heart and mind of\n\n[M.] exuding from his demeanor and his actions throughout the time spent with his\n\nchildren. This recognized hatred has worked to harm the children. . . .” According\n\nto W., the evidence adduced in the case had rebutted the presumption that the\n\nstandard possession order is in the children’s best interest, and she sought an order\n\ndeveloping a transitory period leading to M. again having possession and access to\n\nthe children after therapists determine that possession and access would be\n\nappropriate.\n\n      On September 18, 2012, the trial judge conducted a “Final Orders” hearing.\n\nM. was not present at the hearing. M.’s counsel argued that with respect to\n\ncontested matters, an amicus attorney is not permitted to testify pursuant to section\n\n107.007 of the Family Code. 4 See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 107.007(a)(4) (West\n\n2008). The trial court denied M.’s motion to remove the amicus. The trial court\n\nthen permitted W.’s counsel and the amicus to introduce evidence concerning the\n\namount of W.’s attorney’s fees and the amicus’s fees. 5 On the same date, the trial\n\n\n\n      4\n          M. had filed a motion to remove the amicus attorney.\n\n                                           21\n\fcourt re-interviewed A.K.M. During the interview, the trial judge told A.K.M. that\n\nthe amicus “told me you wanted to tell me something.” A.K.M. then said that none\n\nof her previous outcry was true. A.K.M. told the judge that M. and B. had told her\n\nto make the allegations. When the trial judge asked A.K.M. if she wanted to visit\n\nher father, she said, “No. I couldn’t. . . . He scares me. I don’t like him. He is\n\nmean, and he lied to me.” A.K.M. also told the trial judge that she did not want to\n\nsee B., and she described B. as “evil.”\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge signed an order in the\n\nmodification proceeding. In its eighteen-page order, the trial judge found that the\n\nmaterial allegations in M.’s suit to modify are untrue and brought frivolously and\n\nfor the purpose of harassment against W., denied M.’s requested modification, and\n\nappointed W. sole managing conservator and M. possessory conservator of the\n\nchildren. The trial court found that M. made a false report of child abuse against\n\nW., and that it is in the best interest of the children to limit M.’s rights as\n\npossessory conservator. Specifically, the trial court found that the standard\n\npossession order is not in the best interest of the children and determined that good\n\ncause exists “to order that [M.] be temporarily denied access during a period of\n\n      5\n       Prior to the hearing, W.’s counsel had filed a motion that sought, among\nother things, the right to introduce supplemental evidence on attorney’s fees\nconcerning “multiple legal proceedings ancillary to the underlying modifications\nheard at trial in January 2012[.]”\n                                          22\n\ftherapeutic intervention leading toward restricted possession and access based on\n\nextreme circumstances found regarding the past behavior of [M.], the\n\ncircumstances of the children, and the physical, medical, educational, and\n\nemotional needs of the children.”\n\n      The trial judge appointed a therapist “to develop a transitory program\n\nleading to unsupervised possession and access of the children by [M.]” by\n\nNovember 1, 2012. The trial court ordered M. to receive therapy from a licensed\n\nmental health care professional, and required M.’s therapist to communicate with\n\nthe court-appointed therapist and to “be guided by the direction of the court-\n\nappointed therapist in the areas of counseling and therapy for [M.]” In addition,\n\nthe trial court’s order required the children to continue treatment with their current\n\nmental health care professionals, and ordered the court-appointed therapist to\n\ncommunicate with the children’s therapists concerning the transitory program.\n\n      Under the terms of the order, the court-appointed therapist, M.’s therapist,\n\nand the children’s therapists were to submit reports to the court and to the parties\n\nstating why the modified standard possession order contained within the order\n\nshould or should not be instituted. These reports were to be submitted no later than\n\nsixty days before the date the modified standard order should begin. The order\n\nprovided that the modified standard possession order would become effective\n\n                                         23\n\f“immediately upon the completion of the transitory program and approval of the\n\nCourt as provided above” and required that all periods of possession by M. shall be\n\nsupervised at the court-appointed therapist’s discretion for the first six months the\n\nmodified standard possession order is exercised. The order also required M. to pay\n\na civil penalty of $500 for making a false report of child abuse. See Tex. Fam.\n\nCode Ann. § 153.013(c) (West 2008). Finally, the trial court’s order awarded W.\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $241,417.59 and ordered M. to transfer exclusive\n\ncontrol of the children’s 529 savings accounts, which M. had established, to W.\n\n      M. filed a motion for new trial. Subsequently, the parties learned that the\n\ncase had been reassigned to Judge Douglas Warne. Judge Warne conducted a\n\nhearing on the motion for new trial on November 19, 2012. At the hearing, M.\n\nproduced letters from three therapists, each of whom had declined to serve as the\n\ncourt-appointed therapist under the September 2012 order. Judge Warne denied the\n\nmotion for new trial.\n\n      On November 29, 2012, Judge Warne signed a “reformed” order, which\n\nchanged the court-appointed therapist to Dr. Lawrence Abrams but kept in place\n\nthe provisions from the September order regarding the transitory therapeutic period\n\nand forbidding M. from having any contact with the children. In January 2013,\n\nJudge Warne filed findings of facts and conclusions of law, in which he made the\n\n                                         24\n\ffollowing findings of fact, among others: (1) M. had attempted to permanently\n\nalienate the children from W., publicly disparaged W., placed his sons’ health,\n\neducation, and development at risk, and “repeatedly demonstrated bizarre and\n\ntroubled behavior in the presence of the Court[;]” (2) it is in the children’s best\n\ninterest that M. “be temporarily denied access to the children so that he may seek\n\nhis own therapeutic treatment/intervention leading to restricted possession and\n\naccess of the children[;]” (3) unrestricted access to the children by M. would\n\nendanger their physical or emotional welfare; (4) “[e]xtreme circumstances exist\n\nsufficient to deny [M.] possession and access of the children until a licensed\n\nmental health professional appointed by the Court determines that it is in the best\n\ninterests of the children to have restricted possession and access[;]” and (5) the 529\n\nfunds “are the property of the children” so W., as sole managing conservator,\n\nshould have “sole unrestricted management and control of said funds.” In its\n\nconclusions of law, the trial court determined that appointing M. as a joint\n\nmanaging conservator would significantly impair the children’s physical health or\n\nemotional development, and limiting M.’s rights, duties, and access to the children\n\nis in the children’s best interest.\n\n       W. filed a motion for judgment nunc pro tunc and a brief in support. W.\n\ncontended that while the judgment awarded attorney’s fees to her, “the order for\n\n                                         25\n\f[M.] to actually pay the award appears to have been inadvertently omitted.”\n\nAccording to W., the requested change was clerical rather than judicial, since the\n\ntrial court stated at the September 2012 hearing that attorney’s fees would be taxed\n\nagainst M. The trial court granted W.’s motion for judgment nunc pro tunc and\n\nordered W. to submit a nunc pro tunc judgment that changed only the heading on\n\npage one and the judgment language on page seventeen. The trial judge\n\nsubsequently signed a judgment nunc pro tunc, which contained language\n\nexplicitly ordering M. to pay W. attorney’s fees in the amount of $241,417.59.\n\n      On February 6, 2013, Dr. Abrams filed the required report with the trial\n\njudge by letter. In the report, Abrams recommended a plan leading to resumption\n\nof contact between M. and the children, and concluding that if M. adhered to the\n\nrequirements of the plan and was able to re-establish relationships with the\n\nchildren, “the court might want to consider going to conventional visitation when\n\nenough time has passed to reassure the court of the father’s stability.” It is unclear\n\nfrom the record why no action has apparently been taken to begin Abrams’s plan\n\nof reunification. W. contends in her brief that M. “has made NO attempt at proving\n\nhis ability to act in the best interest of the children, and therefore have access to the\n\nchildren, by simply scheduling an appointment with the children’s counselors to\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fbegin the plan of reunification.” She cites to nothing in the appellate record that\n\nverifies this assertion.\n\n                                    ISSUE ONE\n\n       In his first issue, M. argues that Judge Underwood abused his discretion by\n\ndenying the motion to recuse Judge Walker due to Judge Walker’s alleged “extra-\n\njudicial bias and pervasive antagonism” toward M. We review an order denying a\n\nmotion to recuse for abuse of discretion. In re M.C.M., 57 S.W.3d 27, 33 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).\n\n       A judge must recuse himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality\n\nmight reasonably be questioned or he has a personal bias or prejudice regarding the\n\nsubject matter or a party. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1), (2). A judge is presumed to be\n\nqualified until the contrary is shown. Sparkman v. Peoples Nat’l Bank of Tyler, 553\n\nS.W.2d 680, 681 (Tex. App.—Waco 1977, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Recusal based upon\n\nan allegation of bias “is appropriate only if the movant provides sufficient evidence\n\nto establish that a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances involved,\n\nwould harbor doubts as to the impartiality of the judge.” Abdygapparova v. State,\n\n243 S.W.3d 191, 198 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2007, pet. ref’d). “[J]udicial\n\nrulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion[,]”\n\nand opinions the judge forms during a trial do not necessitate recusal “unless they\n\n                                          27\n\fdisplay a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment\n\nimpossible.” Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994). “Thus, judicial\n\nremarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even\n\nhostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or\n\npartiality challenge.” Id. Expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance,\n\nand anger do not establish bias or partiality when those expressions arise from\n\nevents that occurred during trial. Id. at 555-56; Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46\n\nS.W.3d 237, 240 (Tex. 2001).\n\n      In his appellate brief, M. complains of Judge Underwood’s exclusion of K.’s\n\ntestimony during the recusal hearing and Judge Walker’s “high degree of\n\nantagonism” against M. “To preserve error concerning the exclusion of evidence,\n\nthe complaining party must actually offer the evidence and secure an adverse\n\nruling from the court.” Perez v. Lopez, 74 S.W.3d 60, 66 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n2002, no pet.). With respect to the exclusion of certain testimony from K., the\n\nrecord reflects that although M.’s counsel argued to the court concerning the\n\nsubstance of the desired testimony and the reasons counsel believed the testimony\n\nwas relevant, M.’s counsel did not make an offer of proof through K. See id.\n\nBecause counsel did not make an offer of proof, M. has failed to preserve the issue\n\nfor review. See Tex. R. Evid. 103(a)(2); Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(B); Weng\n\n                                         28\n\fEnters., Inc. v. Embassy World Travel, Inc., 837 S.W.2d 217, 221 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1992, no writ).\n\n      Undoubtedly, the trial judge frequently and extensively displayed anger,\n\nfrustration, annoyance, and dissatisfaction with M. and his attorney, as well as\n\nskepticism and disbelief about M.’s testimony, during the course of the\n\nproceedings. The record of the April 2012 emergency hearing indicates that the\n\ntrial judge initially became angry with M. and skeptical of his testimony when\n\nHoge and Miller contradicted M.’s testimony, and it was at that point when the\n\ntrial judge announced his intention to interview A.K.M. in chambers. By the time\n\nthe trial judge called Hoge and Miller to testify, he had heard M. testify and\n\nobserved M.’s demeanor on the stand for almost three hours. It is clear from the\n\nmanner in which the trial judge conducted the interview with A.K.M. that the trial\n\ncourt disbelieved M.’s testimony concerning A.K.M.’s outcry. However, the record\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the trial judge’s disbelief of M.’s testimony and his\n\nsubsequent displays of anger were derived from an extrajudicial source. Rather, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that the trial judge’s anger, annoyance, frustration, and\n\ndissatisfaction likely derived from his belief that M. had given false testimony.\n\nWhile the trial judge undoubtedly displayed anger and a desire to see M. criminally\n\ninvestigated, his conduct does not demonstrate such a pervasive extrajudicial bias\n\n                                        29\n\for antagonism that required recusal. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1), (2); Liteky, 510\n\nU.S. at 555; Abdygapparova, 243 S.W.3d at 198; Francis, 46 S.W.3d at 240.\n\nAccordingly, Judge Underwood did not abuse his discretion by denying M.’s\n\nmotion to recuse. We overrule issue one.\n\n                                   ISSUE FIVE\n\n      In his fifth issue, M. argues the trial court erred by permitting W.’s counsel\n\nto call the amicus attorney to testify regarding contested issues of fact. See Tex.\n\nFam. Code Ann. § 107.007 (West 2008). As discussed above, M.’s counsel did not\n\nobject during the emergency hearing to the amicus attorney testifying. Therefore,\n\nM. failed to preserve the issue for appeal. See Conn v. Rhodes, No. 2-08-420-CV,\n\n2009 WL 2579577, at *5 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Aug. 20, 2009, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (Failure to object at trial to the admission of an amicus attorney’s report or\n\ntestimony waives the complaint on appeal.); see also Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); In re\n\nJ.K.F., 345 S.W.3d 706, 717 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.). Accordingly, we\n\noverrule issue five.\n\n                                    ISSUE SIX\n\n      In issue six, M. contends the trial court abused its discretion by ordering M.\n\nto transfer control of the children’s 529 college plans to W. and to pay attorney’s\n\nfees in the amount of $241,417.59. With respect to the 529 accounts, M. argues\n\n                                        30\n\fthat no pleadings or evidence support the order. With respect to the attorney’s fees,\n\nM. apparently asserts that no pleadings support an award of any fees other than\n\nthose incurred at the January trial, and he maintains that the trial judge lacked\n\nauthority to award fees for the mandamus proceeding or the recusal proceeding.\n\n      In her counter-petition, W. pleaded for “reasonable attorney’s fees . . .\n\nthrough trial and appeal[;]” therefore, M.’s contention that no pleadings support an\n\naward of attorney’s fees is inaccurate. Section 106.002 of the Family Code\n\nprovides, “In a suit under this title, the court may render judgment for reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees and expenses . . . .” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 106.002(a) (West\n\n2008). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney’s\n\nfees for the January 2012 custody hearing or the April 2012 emergency hearing.\n\nSee id. However, we conclude that the trial court lacked the authority to award\n\nattorney’s fees for the mandamus proceeding or the recusal proceeding. A\n\nmandamus proceeding is an original appellate proceeding seeking extraordinary\n\nrelief. Tex. R. App. P. 52.1. Although the mandamus was related to the\n\nmodification suit, it was an original, separate proceeding within the jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court. See In the Interest of V.T., No. 2-03-248-CV, 2004 WL 1353024, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth June 17, 2004, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (When father filed\n\na petition for writ of mandamus complaining of the trial court’s order denying his\n\n                                         31\n\fmotion to disqualify mother’s attorney in a modification case, trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction to award attorney’s fees for the mandamus proceeding.).\n\n      With respect to the recusal proceeding, Rule 18a(h) of the Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure provides that the judge who hears the motion to recuse may order\n\nthe party or attorney who filed the motion, or both, to pay reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees and expenses incurred by the other party if the judge finds that the motion was\n\n(1) groundless and filed in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment or (2) clearly\n\nbrought for unnecessary delay and without sufficient cause. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(h).\n\nJudge Underwood did not award attorney’s fees to M., and the trial judge lacked\n\nauthority to assess attorney’s fees for the recusal proceeding. See id.\n\n      With respect to the children’s 529 savings plans, M. argues that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by requiring M. to sign control of the plans over to W.\n\nbecause the trial judge “stated no basis for his order, and there were no pleadings\n\nand no evidence to support it.” As discussed above, in her counter-petition, W.\n\nrequested appointment as sole managing conservator in her counter-petition, and\n\nthe trial court appointed W. sole managing conservator of the children and granted\n\nW. the exclusive right to make decisions concerning the children’s education. The\n\nevidence established that (1) M. opened the plans and was the participant, (2) the\n\ndivorce decree provided that M. would control the 529 college savings plans, and\n\n                                          32\n\f(3) for three years, M. put all of his bonuses into the 529 plans, which totaled\n\napproximately $437,000 at the time of trial. The evidence also established that in\n\n2009, as part of an order permitting M. to transfer the accounts to a different\n\nbrokerage firm, the trial judge enjoined M. from using any of the 529 funds for any\n\npurpose other than a “qualified higher education expense” as defined by the\n\ninvestment plan, and also enjoined M. from changing the beneficiary of any of the\n\naccounts without W.’s express written consent.\n\n      W. contends she “specifically placed the 529 accounts into issue in her\n\nRequest for Additional Relief[,]”which she filed on September 14, 2012, and she\n\nalso points to her general prayer for any and all other relief the trial court\n\ndetermined to be in the children’s best interest and for their protection. In W.’s\n\nrequest for additional relief, she asked that the court order M. to provide statements\n\nfor the 529 accounts to her by certified mail on the first day of each month “to\n\ninsure his fiduciary duties to the children are being met[,]” but she did not request\n\nthat control of the 529 plans be transferred to her. W.’s second amended counter\n\npetition, her live pleading at the time of the hearings, also did not request such\n\nrelief. We conclude that ownership of the 529 savings accounts was not an issue\n\nraised by the pleadings. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by ordering\n\nM. to transfer ownership of the 529 savings accounts to W. See In re Russell, 321\n\n                                         33\n\fS.W.3d 846, 855 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2010, orig. proceeding) (“A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion by awarding relief to a person who has not requested such\n\nrelief in a live pleading.”); Tex. R. Civ. P. 301 (The judgment shall conform to the\n\npleadings.).\n\n      We sustain issue six. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the trial court to\n\ndetermine the appropriate amount of attorney’s fees consistent with this opinion by\n\nsegregating the attorney’s fees that are recoverable from those that are not, as well\n\nas for entry of an order transferring ownership of the 529 savings accounts back to\n\nM. See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006)\n\n(“[I]f any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are\n\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.”);\n\nRussell, 321 S.W.3d at 855.\n\n                                  ISSUE SEVEN\n\n      In issue seven, M. complains of the trial court’s entry of a judgment nunc\n\npro tunc to correct what M. contends was a judicial error. As discussed above,\n\nupon W.’s motion, the trial judge signed a judgment nunc pro tunc, which\n\ncontained language explicitly ordering M. to pay W. attorney’s fees in the amount\n\nof $241,417.59. At the September 2012 hearing on final orders, the trial court\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\ffound that W.’s reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees in the amount of\n\n$241,417.59 “will be taxed against [M].”\n\n      A trial court may correct a clerical error in a judgment at any time by\n\nentering a judgment nunc pro tunc. Tex. R. Civ. P. 316, 329b(f); Escobar v.\n\nEscobar, 711 S.W.2d 230, 231 (Tex. 1986). The determination of whether an error\n\nin a judgment is judicial or clerical is a question of law that we review de novo.\n\nRoan v. Roan, No. 03-09-00155-CV, 2010 WL 4260974, at *5 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\nOct. 28, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.); Escobar, 711 S.W.2d at 232. “A clerical error\n\nis a discrepancy between the entry of a judgment in the record and the judgment\n\nthat was actually rendered by the court, and does not arise from judicial reasoning\n\nor determination.” Rawlins v. Rawlins, 324 S.W.3d 852, 855 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.). “A judicial error, on the other hand, occurs in the\n\nrendering, as opposed to the entering, of a judgment. Id. “A judgment is rendered\n\nwhen the decision is officially announced either orally in open court or by a\n\nmemorandum filed with the clerk.” Id. The trial court “can only correct the entry of\n\na final written judgment that incorrectly states the judgment actually rendered.”\n\nEscobar, 711 S.W.2d at 231-32.\n\n      We conclude that the trial judge’s pronouncement awarded a judgment in\n\nfavor of W. from M. for attorney’s fees, and the failure to include in the written\n\n                                        35\n\fjudgment a provision that expressly ordered M. to pay W. attorney’s fees in the\n\namount of $241,417.59 was a clerical error that the trial court could properly\n\ncorrect by entry of a judgment nunc pro tunc. See Escobar, 711 S.W.2d at 231-32;\n\nRawlins, 324 S.W.3d at 855. Accordingly, we overrule issue seven.\n\n                                    ISSUE NINE\n\n      In issue nine, M. challenges the trial court’s conclusions of law regarding\n\njoint managing conservatorship, rights and duties, and possession and access. We\n\nreview a trial judge’s decision on a petition to modify under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard. In re W.C.B., 337 S.W.3d 510, 513 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.).\n\nWe determine whether the trial judge acted arbitrarily or without reference to any\n\nguiding rules or principles. Id. Because the abuse-of-discretion standard of review\n\noverlaps with traditional sufficiency standards of review in family law cases,\n\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence are not independent grounds for\n\nreversal, but instead constitute factors relevant to determining whether the trial\n\njudge abused his discretion. In re A.B.P., 291 S.W.3d 91, 95 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2009, no pet.).\n\n      M. argues that although the order appointed him a possessory conservator,\n\nthe trial court’s order also stripped him of nearly all parental rights and effectively\n\ndenied him all possession of and access to his children, an outcome not supported\n\n                                          36\n\fby sufficient evidence.      M. points out that “while the denial of access is\n\npurportedly ‘temporary,’ the trial court’s order does not provide any enforceable\n\nprovisions for future access. Instead, future access is left to the determination of\n\nthe therapist under a poorly defined ‘transitory program’ leading to a modified\n\npossession order on a date that is also to be determined.”\n\n      A parent of the child has the right to have physical possession of the child.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 151.001(a)(1) (West 2008). Public policy dictates that\n\nchildren will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown\n\nthe ability to act in the children’s best interest. Id. § 153.001(a)(1); In re C.R.O., 96\n\nS.W.3d 442, 447 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2002, pet. denied). The trial court must\n\nconsider the best interest of the children, and there is a rebuttable presumption that\n\nappointment of both parents as joint managing conservators is in the children’s\n\nbest interest. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 153.002, 153.131(b). There is also a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the standard possession order is in the children’s best\n\ninterest. Id. § 153.252(2). A finding by the court that a report of abuse made during\n\nthe pendency of a suit affecting the parent-child relationship was false or lacking\n\nfactual foundation may constitute grounds for the court to modify an order\n\nproviding for possession of or access to a child who was the subject of the report\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\fby restricting further access to the child by the person who made the report. Id. §\n\n261.107(b) (emphasis added).\n\n      “The terms of an order that denies possession of a child to a parent or\n\nimposes restrictions or limitations on a parent’s right to possession of or access to a\n\nchild may not exceed those that are required to protect the best interest of the\n\nchild.” Id. § 153.193. A trial court’s discretion to make temporary orders is limited\n\nby a fit parent’s right to exercise his parental rights. See In re Scheller, 325 S.W.3d\n\n640, 642 (Tex. 2010) (citing Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 68, 72-73 (2000)).\n\nUsing a neutral third party, such as a mental health professional, to assist with\n\ndetermining the most appropriate possession rights may be necessary in a complex\n\nfamily law situation. In re J.S.P., 278 S.W.3d 414, 422 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2008, no pet.). “[D]elegating specific issues related to possession and access [to a\n\nthird party] appears to be permissible so long as the parent maintains access to\n\ntheir child, and only faces the possibility of the denial of specific periods of\n\npossession.” Id. (emphasis added). A trial court’s ability to obtain assistance from a\n\nthird party is limited by the requirement that the court must maintain the power to\n\nenforce its judgment; that is, the order must be sufficiently specific to be\n\nenforceable by contempt. Id. at 422-23.\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f       In In re J.S.P., the child’s maternal grandmother was named sole managing\n\nconservator, but the appellant father, who suffered cognitive impairment due to a\n\nhead injury prior to J.S.P.’s birth, was permitted supervised visitation. Id. at 417.\n\nThe father subsequently filed a petition to modify, in which he requested\n\nappointment as joint managing conservator with the exclusive right to designate\n\nJ.S.P.’s primary residence, and he requested a standard possession order. Id. The\n\ntrial court entered temporary orders that continued supervised visitation, but on a\n\nschedule. Id. After a jury trial, in which appellant was named a joint managing\n\nconservator along with the grandmother, the trial court conducted a bench trial on\n\nissues of possession and access. Id. At the conclusion of the bench trial, the trial\n\ncourt continued the supervised visitation schedule and ordered the creation by a\n\npsychologist of a transitory program intended to lead to unsupervised visitation by\n\nthe father. Id.\n\n       W. cites In re J.S.P. for the proposition that orders utilizing a mental health\n\nprofessional to develop a transitory program must state a date by which the\n\ntransitory program should be developed, a date by which the standard possession\n\norder should begin, or a deadline by which the therapist must report reasons why\n\nthe transitory program could not be developed or why standard possession should\n\nnot commence. W. argues that the order the trial court entered in this case meets\n\n                                          39\n\fthe requirements set forth in In re J.S.P. W. ignores the fact that In re J.S.P. did\n\nnot involve depriving the father of all rights of visitation and access. See id. at 417-\n\n23.\n\n      We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the\n\ntrial court’s determination that the standard possession order would not be in the\n\nchildren’s best interest. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the trial\n\ncourt’s order forbidding M. from contacting the children and denying M. all rights\n\nof possession and access, even on an ostensibly temporary basis. See generally\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.193; Moore v. Moore, 383 S.W.3d 190, 198 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied) (In family law cases, sufficiency of the evidence\n\nissues are relevant factors in determining whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion.); In re A.B.P., 291 S.W.3d at 95. The trial court therefore abused its\n\ndiscretion by forbidding M. from contacting the children and denying M. all rights\n\nof possession or access. Accordingly, we sustain issue nine in part, reverse the\n\nportions of the trial court’s order that provide that M. have no visitation or access\n\nto the children and that M. cannot contact the children, and remand the case to the\n\ntrial court for entry of an appropriate order consistent with this opinion. The trial\n\ncourt may consider the recommendations set forth in Dr. Abrams’s February 2013\n\nreport; however, we will leave the specific terms of visitation and access to the trial\n\n                                          40\n\fcourt’s discretion. We need not address M.’s remaining issues, as they would not\n\nresult in greater relief. See Tex. R.

Appellant raises\n\nten issues for our consideration. We affirm the trial court’s order denying the\n\nmotion to recuse, and we affirm the trial court’s modification order in part and\n\nreverse and remand the order in part for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n\f                           FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Appellant M. and the children’s mother, appellee W., 1 divorced on October\n\n27, 2008. In 2010, M. filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship. In his\n\npetition, M. sought appointment as sole managing conservator of the children or,\n\nalternatively, appointment as joint managing conservator with the right to\n\ndetermine the children’s primary residence, as well as child support from W. M.\n\ncontended that W. had attempted to alienate him from the children, parented the\n\nchildren inappropriately, failed to provide proper medical care for the children,\n\nfailed to co-parent the children with him, and that W. suffered from Munchausen\n\nsyndrome by proxy, “otherwise known as a histrionic personality disorder.”\n\nAccording to M., W. had falsely insisted to mental health professionals and school\n\nofficials that J.D.M. and D.M.M. suffered from Asperger’s syndrome. The judge of\n\nthe 279th District Court, where the divorce action was litigated, eventually recused\n\nhimself from the case, and the case was reassigned to the 252nd District Court,\n\nalthough the appellate record does not reflect the precise means by which the\n\nreassignment was accomplished.\n\n      W. filed a counter-petition, in which she sought appointment as sole\n\nmanaging conservator of the children and contended that “[t]he parties have been\n\n      1\n        To protect the children’s privacy, we will refer to the appellant as “M.” and\nto the appellee as “W.”\n                                          2\n\funable to communicate in a manner conducive to joint managing conservatorship.”\n\nW. asserted that M. had exposed the children to hostility and alienation against her\n\nby filing “constant and continuing litigation[,]” contacting law enforcement\n\nofficers despite the lack of an emergency, having trespass and cease and desist\n\nwarnings issued that forbade W. from his residence, “mounting a letter[-]writing\n\ncampaign to medical and psychological providers for the children accusing her of\n\nharming the children[,]” sending private emails between the parties to other\n\nindividuals, and causing a complaint to be made against W. with the Texas\n\nDepartment of Family and Protective Services (“CPS”). W. further alleged that M.\n\nhad demonstrated an inability to maintain a positive relationship with her “that is\n\nconducive to joint managing conservatorship,” exposed the children to the\n\novernight stays of his sexual partners, and “exposed the children to unknown and\n\nunchecked individuals during the operation of another’s business” in his residence.\n\nW. requested that M. exercise possession and access pursuant to the standard\n\npossession order “if and only if recommended by the court[-]appointed mental\n\nhealth professionals[.]”\n\n      The custody case was tried to the bench in January 2012. According to M.,\n\nthe trial judge sent M. and W. to Dr. Michelle Douget, who advised the trial court\n\nthat M. and W. should cooperate and agree regarding the treatment of the children\n\n                                         3\n\fand recommended that M. and W. have psychological testing for personality traits,\n\nas well as participate in ongoing therapy. M. testified that Douget found he did not\n\nsuffer from any mental abnormalities.\n\n      Clinical psychologist Dr. Dan Roberts testified the trial judge asked him to\n\nevaluate M. and W., and that he interviewed both M. and W. for several hours and\n\nasked them to complete two personality inventories. Roberts also testified that he\n\nreviewed a report from Dr. Timothy Bohan, who the trial court had previously\n\nappointed as an expert to evaluate the children. 2 Roberts also testified that he\n\ntalked to all three of the children, spoke to several people about M. and W., and\n\nreviewed the children’s medical, pharmacy, counseling, school, and other records.\n\nRoberts also spoke to two of the children’s teachers.\n\n      Roberts recommended that the trial court consider increasing M.’s\n\npossession time with the children, and he explained that the two older children\n\nwanted more time with their father. Roberts also recommended that the court\n\nconsider appointing a parenting facilitator rather than a parenting coordinator\n\nbecause a facilitator is permitted to testify concerning the parents’ progress, which\n\n\n      2\n        Although the trial court stated that it did not intend to consider any of the\nopinions Bohan offered with respect to M. or W., the trial court cited Bohan’s\nreport as evidence in support of its findings of fact. In the report, Bohan stated that\nhe found some of M.’s responses during the evaluation troubling and indicative of\nunusual thought processes.\n                                          4\n\fwould allow the case to proceed and expose the children to less conflict. In\n\naddition, Roberts testified that prior to the divorce, M. had suffered a bout of major\n\ndepression, during which he was delusional. According to Roberts, M. is capable\n\nof making medical and educational decisions for the children “up to a point[,]” but\n\nRoberts explained, “I’m not certain that that’s a capacity or a willingness that is\n\nstable based on his history.” Roberts stated that M. “should have a voice” in\n\nmaking such decisions.\n\n      In Roberts’s psychological assessment of M., which was based upon his\n\nexamination of M. on November 16, 2011, and was introduced into evidence, he\n\nconcluded that M. had no “significant current problems” with depression, anxiety,\n\npsychosis, stress management, or anger management, and that M. was currently\n\nparticipating in counseling to help him manage stress. Roberts later noted in his\n\nassessment that M. was “experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression\n\nassociated with the aftermath of his divorce and his concern about the children’s\n\nwelfare[,]” and that M. had “obsessive tendencies, competitiveness, unusual ideas,\n\nand a degree of inflexibility under stressful conditions.” Roberts’s assessment\n\nconcluded that “[o]n the whole [M.] appears to be a capable and concerned\n\nparent.”\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      At the conclusion of the custody trial, the trial court issued temporary orders\n\nawarding W. the exclusive right to consent to medical, dental, psychiatric, and\n\npsychological treatment for the children, as well as the exclusive right to make\n\ndecisions concerning their educational needs, and ordered that M. “will not have\n\nany contact with any teacher or medical provider or evaluator.” In a second order,\n\nthe trial court ordered that M. and W. would remain joint managing conservators of\n\nthe children, a behavior plan should be developed for D.M.M. through the public\n\nschool district, any appropriate therapy for D.M.M. shall begin immediately, the\n\nparties shall not publicly discuss the children’s medical issues except with medical\n\nproviders or teachers, and the parties shall not discuss medical issues with the\n\nchildren. The trial court further ordered that M. would have possession of the\n\nchildren pursuant to the expanded standard possession order “as set out in the\n\nTexas Family Code[,]” A.K.M. and J.D.M. shall have one extra overnight with M.\n\nif they so choose, the parties shall utilize an internet calendaring system with the\n\namicus attorney for the children’s extracurricular activities, and both M. and W.\n\nshall participate separately in therapy. The trial court set the cause for final hearing\n\non June 4, 2012.\n\n       In April 2012, M. filed an emergency motion for protection and\n\nappointment of an attorney ad litem, in which he alleged that A.K.M. had made an\n\n                                           6\n\foutcry of sexual abuse against W., and the trial court conducted an emergency\n\nhearing on the motion on April 10 and 11, 2012. At the emergency hearing, M.\n\ntestified that he had been exercising visitation with the children since the trial\n\ncourt’s temporary orders, and he described A.K.M as “in a state of full[-] scale\n\nmeltdown” and indicated that A.K.M.’s grades were poor and she was very angry\n\nwith her mother and grandmother. According to M., A.K.M. indicated that she\n\nwanted to live with her father, and “she’s afraid to go back to her mother’s.” M.\n\ntestified that J.D.M. was also angry that since the temporary orders were entered,\n\nM. had not been participating in his schooling, and he also testified that D.M.M.\n\nwas regressing with potty training.\n\n      M. explained that A.K.M.’s condition had deteriorated significantly during\n\nthe last month, and she had been “near hysterical[.]” According to M., A.K.M.\n\nmade an outcry of sexual abuse against W. to M.’s girlfriend B., and A.K.M. then\n\ncontinued her outcry to M. M. testified that he had not suspected any abuse and\n\nwas shocked by it. M. explained that he took A.K.M. to the police department, and\n\nA.K.M. wrote a statement. M. subsequently received a call from Detective Mark\n\nHoge, who asked M. to bring B. and A.K.M. to the police station. M. testified that\n\nA.K.M. was interviewed for about two and a half hours, and the investigating\n\nofficer also interviewed M. and B. According to M., both Detective Hoge and\n\n                                        7\n\fSarah Miller from the Lufkin CPS office told M. that CPS would arrive at noon to\n\ndo a Priority One removal and have the children professionally interviewed. M.\n\ntestified that he wanted the trial court to make him “sole managing conservator\n\nwith all powers” during the pendency of the investigation, and that W. have no\n\nvisitation during that time.\n\n       The trial court asked the amicus attorney to contact Detective Hoge and\n\nMiller. The trial judge personally questioned both Hoge and Miller on the record\n\nafter they were sworn, and both Hoge and Miller denied telling M. that CPS\n\nintended to remove the children. The trial judge then announced his intention to\n\ninterview A.K.M. with a court reporter present, and the record reflects that the trial\n\njudge extensively interviewed A.K.M., who was thirteen years old at the time, in\n\nchambers. The reporter’s record of the interview encompasses seventy-nine pages.\n\nThe time stamps in the record of the hearing, although less than a model of clarity,\n\nreflect that the interview apparently began at 1:18 p.m. and continued until 2:44\n\np.m.\n\n       When M. returned to the stand, W.’s counsel asked the court to admonish M.\n\nof “his Fifth Amendment rights for perjury.” W.’s counsel asked M. if he testified\n\nthat CPS and the police told him that the children were going to be removed, and\n\nM. testified, “[o]bviously I misspoke or misunderstood” and was “in error.” M.\n\n                                          8\n\ftestified that he was on medication for weight loss and acid reflux, but was not\n\nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol. M. testified that he thought he recalled\n\nDetective Hoge telling him the case would be treated as a Priority One, but that his\n\nmemory was apparently incorrect, and he attributed his faulty recollection to the\n\nfear he had experienced since A.K.M.’s outcry.\n\n      W.’s counsel asked M. whether he had discussed the case with K., a blogger\n\nwho M. (an attorney) represents, and M. responded that he had done so, but not in\n\ndetail, and M. indicated that he feared K.’s issues with the trial judge would be\n\ntaken out on M. M. testified that he had told A.K.M. to tell the truth when she\n\nspoke to the trial judge. W.’s counsel asked M. whether he had anything to do\n\nwith “reports in various newspapers and news media . . . about what a bad judge . .\n\n. Layne Walker is[,]” and M. denied having any involvement with those reports or\n\ntelling his children that the judge was bad, crazy, or mean. M. testified that he\n\nshowed the children one of the trial court’s temporary orders because they were\n\nupset because he was not attending parent-teacher conferences. M. denied asking a\n\nlocal reporter to publish a story concerning W.’s alleged romantic relationship with\n\na political figure, but M. admitted that he had discussed the alleged relationship\n\nwith the reporter. M. testified that he took A.K.M. on an overnight trip to “have\n\nsome fun, to put it out of her mind” after A.K.M. made the outcry. M. denied\n\n                                         9\n\fscheduling the trip as a reward. M. also explained that he “was concerned if [the\n\noutcry] was fabrication that [A.K.M.] needed substantial help.” M. testified that he\n\nhad repeatedly asked A.K.M. whether she was sure her allegations were true, and\n\ntold her not to say things just because she wanted to live with him. At the\n\nconclusion of the day’s testimony, the trial judge also announced that the record of\n\nhis interview with A.K.M. was sealed and “nobody will ask for a copy of it\n\nbecause you are not going to get it.”\n\n      M. was not present when the proceedings resumed the next morning. M.’s\n\ncounsel objected to going forward without M. but did not otherwise object to the\n\namicus attorney testifying. The amicus attorney, Raquel West, testified that she\n\nhad served as an amicus attorney in the case for approximately ten months, and she\n\nhad interacted with the children, M., and W. on many occasions.\n\n      According to West, M. called her because he believed he could not attend\n\none of J.D.M.’s school activities, and West advised M. “that was not the order or\n\nthe spirit of the order of the Court[,]” and she testified that she had also spoken\n\nwith the trial judge about the issue, and West advised M. that the only restriction\n\nhe had was “contacting teachers and medical providers.” West testified that M.\n\nindicated he understood, and M. attended the activity. West explained that she\n\nheard M.’s testimony that he believed he could not be involved with the children’s\n\n                                        10\n\fschooling, including reading, proofing, or approving their homework, and West\n\ntestified that she found M.’s testimony incredible and “quite disturbing.”\n\nAccording to West, J.D.M. and A.K.M. had both been exercising their right to\n\nhave an additional day with their father, and A.K.M. “is doing really poorly in\n\nschool in several subjects, not just one.”\n\n      West testified that she heard M. say that he was not helping or following\n\nthrough with checking whether A.K.M. had homework, and West stated, “I truly\n\nbelieve he was potentially trying to sabotage her school and her grades in an effort\n\nto show that because [W.] got the educational decision-making that he could . . .\n\nshow . . . how poorly [A.K.M.] has done.” West also explained that M.’s testimony\n\nabout the children being upset about the trial court’s ruling confused her “because\n\nthey actually got what they wanted and that was an extra day with their dad.” West\n\nopined that the children should not have seen a change in their daily lives, and that\n\nit was inappropriate for M. to leave a court order out for them to read.\n\n      West testified, “I find . . . that these children are damaged because of him. I\n\nthink they are continuing to be damaged even more so since the order. He is taking\n\nout his frustrations in a very conniving way on these children.” In addition, West\n\nopined that M. has permanently changed the direction of A.K.M.’s life, and she\n\nrecommended that A.K.M. have intensive psychotherapy. West testified that\n\n                                             11\n\fA.K.M. has been “brainwashed to some extent” and that M. taught her “to be\n\nmanipulative to get what you want.” West also opined that most of A.K.M.’s\n\noutcry was false and was promoted by M. West opined that with respect to\n\nA.K.M., “any access to her father needs to be extremely limited and probably\n\nsupervised.” West further opined that all of the children could deteriorate under the\n\ncircumstances. West testified that A.K.M. is willing to sacrifice herself to protect\n\nher father.\n\n      M. arrived during cross-examination of West. When M. retook the stand for\n\nadditional cross-examination, he explained that he passed out on the stand the\n\nprevious day and did not have full memory of everything that occurred. M.\n\nexplained that taking weight loss medication, only eating a breakfast bar all day,\n\nand dehydration contributed to an anxiety attack. M. denied telling A.K.M. “to do\n\nthis[;]” i.e., make an outcry. M. testified, “I always thought from the beginning,\n\n2008, that there would be a relentless attempt to terminate my rights.” When asked\n\nwhether he contacted K. after leaving the courtroom, M. responded that K. visited\n\nhim at the hospital, and that he spoke with K. that morning and told him he was\n\nscared. M. testified that he did not believe he committed perjury and did not\n\nintentionally lie. When asked whether he should have control of the children when\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fhe is under such distress that he was not in control of his faculties, M. testified, “As\n\nI sit here right now, no, I’m too upset.”\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court stated as follows:\n\n             I just want an entire copy of this transcript turned over to the\n      Jefferson County District Attorney’s office and I want Mr. Maness to\n      have his staff or whoever he chooses to review this for perjury and/or\n      aggravated perjury. I do claim to be an expert in that area, but I am\n      not going to make that decision. If Mr. Maness’s Grand Jury is not\n      willing to take a look at it[,] I will be willing to convene a special\n      Grand Jury for the sole purpose of taking a look at this.\n             . . . I am going to order [M.] to cease and desist from relying on\n      hearsay in his life.\n\n           . . . [M.] will have no contact with these children of any nature\n      whatsoever until further order of the Court.\n\n      On April 11, 2012, the trial court signed a temporary order that removed the\n\nchildren from both M. and W., forbade M. and W. from having contact with the\n\nchildren, and temporarily appointed the children’s maternal grandmother as their\n\nsole managing conservator. On April 19, 2012, the trial court signed an order\n\ndenying M.’s motion for protective order and appointment of an attorney ad litem.\n\nIn that order, the trial court found that M.’s “acts and manipulations . . . have\n\nplaced all of the children at immediate and significant risk of danger to their\n\nphysical and emotional welfare and caused the children to be in immediate danger\n\nin [his presence].” The court further found that M. had not acted in the children’s\n\nbest interest, and that the children’s present circumstances would significantly\n                                            13\n\fimpair their physical health and emotional welfare. The trial court removed all\n\nthree children from M.’s custody and presence “for the children’s own protection.”\n\nAdditionally, the order provided that the provisions in the temporary order of April\n\n10 with regard to W. would remain “until confirmation has been received by this\n\nCourt that [CPS] ha[s] ruled out the allegations of abuse against [W.].”\n\nFurthermore, the trial court ordered that upon receipt of such confirmation, W.\n\n“shall have unlimited and unrestricted possession and access of the children subject\n\nof this suit.”\n\n       On April 18, 2012, the trial court held a hearing on W.’s motion to enter\n\norders. The hearing was scheduled because M. had filed a petition for writ of\n\nmandamus with this Court after the hearing on the emergency motion, and the\n\npurpose of the hearing apparently was to provide this Court with an order to review\n\nin the mandamus proceeding. M. was not present at the hearing. At the hearing,\n\nM.’s counsel acknowledged that the amicus had sent a letter stating that CPS and\n\nthe police did not intend to proceed with any allegations of abuse against W. The\n\ntrial judge stated,\n\n       I want to make sure that the record is clear as well. . . .\n       Correspondence that has been made or phone calls that have been\n       made has been from the investigating authorities to the Court. I have\n       not been involved in constant conversation. . . . [A]t no time has the\n       Court involved itself in the investigation.\n\n                                        14\n\fAt one point during the proceedings, when W.’s counsel and the trial judge were\n\nquestioning M.’s counsel about the basis for his objections to the proposed order,\n\nthe following exchange occurred between M.’s counsel, W.’s counsel, and the trial\n\njudge:\n\n         [W.’s counsel]:    Did you hear . . . [M.]’s response to the question\n         when I asked him if he was capable of taking care of the children and\n         on the second day he said he wasn’t capable of taking care of himself\n         right now and no, he wasn’t capable of taking care of the children?\n\n         [M.’s counsel]:     I heard him say at this point at this time, which is\n         [with] reference to his present condition.\n\n         [W.’s counsel]:     So, now, you are making the objection to the Court\n         that there was no evidence upon which the Judge can base the ruling\n         that the children shouldn’t be around [M.] for their own protection?\n\n         [M.’s counsel]:    Because he was not capable of taking care of the\n         children at that point is not grounds for taking away the children\n         permanently from him, which this paragraph does.\n\n         THE COURT:         Can I just ask for my protection, is there anything\n         now in the record that suggests otherwise?\n\n         [M.’s counsel]:    That the children should not be taken away?\n\n         THE COURT:         The only evidence that I have before me is [M.]\n         saying that he is not in a position to take care of them. [M.] has\n         voluntarily absen[t]ed himself from the proceeding today. . . . Is there\n         anything in the record from the day he testified to that that has\n         changed?\n\nM.’s counsel objected “to being put under examination.”\n\n\n                                           15\n\f      W.’s counsel’s examination of M.’s counsel continued on for dozens of\n\npages of the reporter’s record, and the trial judge also made comments to M.’s\n\ncounsel and questioned M.’s counsel during the examination. The trial judge also\n\ncommented that he believed M. made a false report of abuse and “spent an\n\nextended period of time brainwashing [A.K.M.] and spending days rewarding her\n\nfor her conduct. . . . [U]nder section 153.013 I find that [M.] definitely made a\n\nfalse report of abuse. He encouraged it. He assisted it.”\n\n      In June 2012, M. filed a motion to recuse the trial judge. M. asserted in the\n\nmotion that the trial judge’s impartiality “may reasonably be questioned.” See Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1). Specifically, M. contended that after the custody trial in\n\nJanuary 2012, K. had published articles which were critical of the trial judge and\n\nhad filed a complaint against the trial judge with the State Commission on Judicial\n\nConduct. M. complained in the motion to recuse that the trial court ordered that\n\nneither M. nor W. have access to the children, “even though there was no\n\ncomplaint filed against [M.] and no affirmative relief asking that [M.] be denied\n\naccess to the children.” In addition, M. complained that the trial judge had ex parte\n\ncommunications, and he pointed to, among other things, the trial court’s comment\n\nat the April 18, 2012, hearing that “It’s been reported to me that since [A.K.M.]\n\nhas been returned that she’s making great strides. Her grades are back in order.\n\n                                          16\n\fEverything is in good shape.” M. also complained of the trial judge’s sealing of\n\nthe record of his interview with A.K.M., as well as the judge permitting W.’s\n\ncounsel to call the amicus attorney as a witness to testify about “highly contested\n\nissues.” In addition, M. alleged that although no complaint had been filed against\n\nM. and no affirmative relief had been requested concerning denying M. access to\n\nthe children, the trial judge sua sponte ordered that neither W. nor M. have access\n\nto the children.\n\n      On June 26, 2012, Judge Olen Underwood conducted a hearing on M.’s\n\nmotion to recuse. M.’s counsel testified that the trial judge summoned an attorney\n\nfor the City of Beaumont to bring the investigative report concerning A.K.M.’s\n\noutcry to chambers, but never made the file part of the record. In addition, M.’s\n\ncounsel testified that during the first day of the hearing, the trial judge commented\n\nto Miller and Hoge about the chance they had to “visit in [c]hambers,” and only the\n\ntrial judge questioned Miller and Hoge; the attorneys were not permitted to do so.\n\nM.’s counsel also testified that communications occurred between the trial judge,\n\nHoge, and Miller on the second day of trial “either by way of telephone or text.”\n\nAccording to M.’s counsel, the trial judge also received a telephone call from W.’s\n\nmother, and the Court invited the parties to listen to his side of the conversation,\n\nbut the parties could not hear what W.’s mother was saying.\n\n                                         17\n\f      M.’s counsel also testified concerning the trial judge’s statements that he\n\nintended to refer the matter to the District Attorney’s office to determine whether\n\nM. had committed perjury or aggravated perjury and that he would convene his\n\nown special grand jury if the District Attorney’s office declined to investigate M.\n\nAccording to counsel, no party had testified that M. had encouraged A.K.M. to\n\nmake false allegations of sexual abuse against W., nor was there any documentary\n\nevidence so indicating.\n\n      M.’s counsel testified that at the April 18 hearing on entry of orders, he was\n\non the stand for approximately three hours, and both the trial judge and opposing\n\ncounsel “aggressively questioned” him concerning a petition for writ of mandamus\n\nhe had filed. M.’s counsel testified that a “pervasive bias . . . occurred in that\n\nhearing and questioning of me and to the point of insulting me, insulting my client,\n\nstating that getting the truth out of me was as difficult as extracting a molar without\n\nNovocaine. On numerous occasions saying that [M.] is not capable of telling the\n\ntruth.”\n\n      M.’s counsel also testified that the trial judge “repeatedly approached\n\n[A.K.M.] trying to get her to recant her testimony” during the in-chambers\n\ninterview, and he explained that even after opposing counsel pointed out that\n\npursuant to statute, an in-chambers interview of the child shall be made a part of\n\n                                          18\n\fthe record, the trial judge still declined to provide the transcript of the interview\n\nand instead sealed it. Counsel testified that A.K.M. never recanted her statements\n\nduring the April interview.\n\n      K. testified that he owns a political consulting group that publishes an\n\ninternet periodical. When M.’s counsel asked him whether he had published\n\nanything on the internet that was critical of the trial judge, W.’s counsel objected\n\non the grounds of relevancy, and Judge Underwood sustained the objection. M.’s\n\ncounsel asked K. whether he had filed a complaint against the trial judge with the\n\nJudicial Commission, and Judge Underwood again sustained W.’s counsel’s\n\nrelevancy objection despite M.’s counsel’s argument that “animosity between [K.]\n\nand . . . Judge Layne Walker has created a problem in our case because the Judge\n\nperceives [M.] as being a close friend of [K.].”\n\n      Miller testified that she had a conversation with the trial judge to which she\n\nand the trial judge were the only participants. According to Miller, the trial judge\n\nasked her if she was investigating the case, and then she answered the same\n\nquestion again when he posed it to her under oath in the courtroom. M.’s counsel\n\nrested at the conclusion of Miller’s testimony. Judge Underwood denied the\n\nmotion to recuse.\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f      On September 14, 2012, W. filed a “request for additional relief in light of\n\nevidence since the date of trial and brief in support[.]” In her request, W. discussed\n\nM.’s testimony at the emergency hearing concerning A.K.M.’s outcry and his\n\ntestimony that CPS had told him a removal of the children was imminent, as well\n\nas the CPS caseworker’s testimony that CPS had not told M. that a removal was\n\nimminent. W. also pleaded that CPS had ruled out the alleged abuse by W., and\n\nshe contended that “evidence was introduced that would lead a reasonable person\n\nto believe [M.] had encouraged and facilitated [A.K.M.] into making allegations . . .\n\nof sexual abuse” against W.\n\n      W. pointed the trial court to this Court’s opinion in the mandamus\n\nproceeding, in which we held that “the trial court heard evidence from which the\n\ncourt could reasonably conclude that the order [changing custody] was necessary\n\nto prevent significant impairment of the children’s physical health and emotional\n\ndevelopment.” 3 In re M., No. 09-12-00179-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1808236</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont May 17, 2012, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). W. asserted that\n\nthe trial court “should recognize a need for continued emotional healing for these\n\nchildren and need for a progressive, gradual return of an aggressively healed and\n\n\n      3\n       The order before this Court in the mandamus proceeding was the trial\ncourt’s initial order that provided neither parent could have contact with the\nchildren, not the order from which M. now appeals.\n                                         20\n\fhealthy father into their lives and minds.” W. requested “the Court to consider the\n\nchildren, who . . . experienced this hostile drama . . . for at least the past five years\n\nof their young lives. Five years of rancid feelings carried in the heart and mind of\n\n[M.] exuding from his demeanor and his actions throughout the time spent with his\n\nchildren. This recognized hatred has worked to harm the children. . . .” According\n\nto W., the evidence adduced in the case had rebutted the presumption that the\n\nstandard possession order is in the children’s best interest, and she sought an order\n\ndeveloping a transitory period leading to M. again having possession and access to\n\nthe children after therapists determine that possession and access would be\n\nappropriate.\n\n      On September 18, 2012, the trial judge conducted a “Final Orders” hearing.\n\nM. was not present at the hearing. M.’s counsel argued that with respect to\n\ncontested matters, an amicus attorney is not permitted to testify pursuant to section\n\n107.007 of the Family Code. 4 See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 107.007(a)(4) (West\n\n2008). The trial court denied M.’s motion to remove the amicus. The trial court\n\nthen permitted W.’s counsel and the amicus to introduce evidence concerning the\n\namount of W.’s attorney’s fees and the amicus’s fees. 5 On the same date, the trial\n\n\n\n      4\n          M. had filed a motion to remove the amicus attorney.\n\n                                           21\n\fcourt re-interviewed A.K.M. During the interview, the trial judge told A.K.M. that\n\nthe amicus “told me you wanted to tell me something.” A.K.M. then said that none\n\nof her previous outcry was true. A.K.M. told the judge that M. and B. had told her\n\nto make the allegations. When the trial judge asked A.K.M. if she wanted to visit\n\nher father, she said, “No. I couldn’t. . . . He scares me. I don’t like him. He is\n\nmean, and he lied to me.” A.K.M. also told the trial judge that she did not want to\n\nsee B., and she described B. as “evil.”\n\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge signed an order in the\n\nmodification proceeding. In its eighteen-page order, the trial judge found that the\n\nmaterial allegations in M.’s suit to modify are untrue and brought frivolously and\n\nfor the purpose of harassment against W., denied M.’s requested modification, and\n\nappointed W. sole managing conservator and M. possessory conservator of the\n\nchildren. The trial court found that M. made a false report of child abuse against\n\nW., and that it is in the best interest of the children to limit M.’s rights as\n\npossessory conservator. Specifically, the trial court found that the standard\n\npossession order is not in the best interest of the children and determined that good\n\ncause exists “to order that [M.] be temporarily denied access during a period of\n\n      5\n       Prior to the hearing, W.’s counsel had filed a motion that sought, among\nother things, the right to introduce supplemental evidence on attorney’s fees\nconcerning “multiple legal proceedings ancillary to the underlying modifications\nheard at trial in January 2012[.]”\n                                          22\n\ftherapeutic intervention leading toward restricted possession and access based on\n\nextreme circumstances found regarding the past behavior of [M.], the\n\ncircumstances of the children, and the physical, medical, educational, and\n\nemotional needs of the children.”\n\n      The trial judge appointed a therapist “to develop a transitory program\n\nleading to unsupervised possession and access of the children by [M.]” by\n\nNovember 1, 2012. The trial court ordered M. to receive therapy from a licensed\n\nmental health care professional, and required M.’s therapist to communicate with\n\nthe court-appointed therapist and to “be guided by the direction of the court-\n\nappointed therapist in the areas of counseling and therapy for [M.]” In addition,\n\nthe trial court’s order required the children to continue treatment with their current\n\nmental health care professionals, and ordered the court-appointed therapist to\n\ncommunicate with the children’s therapists concerning the transitory program.\n\n      Under the terms of the order, the court-appointed therapist, M.’s therapist,\n\nand the children’s therapists were to submit reports to the court and to the parties\n\nstating why the modified standard possession order contained within the order\n\nshould or should not be instituted. These reports were to be submitted no later than\n\nsixty days before the date the modified standard order should begin. The order\n\nprovided that the modified standard possession order would become effective\n\n                                         23\n\f“immediately upon the completion of the transitory program and approval of the\n\nCourt as provided above” and required that all periods of possession by M. shall be\n\nsupervised at the court-appointed therapist’s discretion for the first six months the\n\nmodified standard possession order is exercised. The order also required M. to pay\n\na civil penalty of $500 for making a false report of child abuse. See Tex. Fam.\n\nCode Ann. § 153.013(c) (West 2008). Finally, the trial court’s order awarded W.\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $241,417.59 and ordered M. to transfer exclusive\n\ncontrol of the children’s 529 savings accounts, which M. had established, to W.\n\n      M. filed a motion for new trial. Subsequently, the parties learned that the\n\ncase had been reassigned to Judge Douglas Warne. Judge Warne conducted a\n\nhearing on the motion for new trial on November 19, 2012. At the hearing, M.\n\nproduced letters from three therapists, each of whom had declined to serve as the\n\ncourt-appointed therapist under the September 2012 order. Judge Warne denied the\n\nmotion for new trial.\n\n      On November 29, 2012, Judge Warne signed a “reformed” order, which\n\nchanged the court-appointed therapist to Dr. Lawrence Abrams but kept in place\n\nthe provisions from the September order regarding the transitory therapeutic period\n\nand forbidding M. from having any contact with the children. In January 2013,\n\nJudge Warne filed findings of facts and conclusions of law, in which he made the\n\n                                         24\n\ffollowing findings of fact, among others: (1) M. had attempted to permanently\n\nalienate the children from W., publicly disparaged W., placed his sons’ health,\n\neducation, and development at risk, and “repeatedly demonstrated bizarre and\n\ntroubled behavior in the presence of the Court[;]” (2) it is in the children’s best\n\ninterest that M. “be temporarily denied access to the children so that he may seek\n\nhis own therapeutic treatment/intervention leading to restricted possession and\n\naccess of the children[;]” (3) unrestricted access to the children by M. would\n\nendanger their physical or emotional welfare; (4) “[e]xtreme circumstances exist\n\nsufficient to deny [M.] possession and access of the children until a licensed\n\nmental health professional appointed by the Court determines that it is in the best\n\ninterests of the children to have restricted possession and access[;]” and (5) the 529\n\nfunds “are the property of the children” so W., as sole managing conservator,\n\nshould have “sole unrestricted management and control of said funds.” In its\n\nconclusions of law, the trial court determined that appointing M. as a joint\n\nmanaging conservator would significantly impair the children’s physical health or\n\nemotional development, and limiting M.’s rights, duties, and access to the children\n\nis in the children’s best interest.\n\n       W. filed a motion for judgment nunc pro tunc and a brief in support. W.\n\ncontended that while the judgment awarded attorney’s fees to her, “the order for\n\n                                         25\n\f[M.] to actually pay the award appears to have been inadvertently omitted.”\n\nAccording to W., the requested change was clerical rather than judicial, since the\n\ntrial court stated at the September 2012 hearing that attorney’s fees would be taxed\n\nagainst M. The trial court granted W.’s motion for judgment nunc pro tunc and\n\nordered W. to submit a nunc pro tunc judgment that changed only the heading on\n\npage one and the judgment language on page seventeen. The trial judge\n\nsubsequently signed a judgment nunc pro tunc, which contained language\n\nexplicitly ordering M. to pay W. attorney’s fees in the amount of $241,417.59.\n\n      On February 6, 2013, Dr. Abrams filed the required report with the trial\n\njudge by letter. In the report, Abrams recommended a plan leading to resumption\n\nof contact between M. and the children, and concluding that if M. adhered to the\n\nrequirements of the plan and was able to re-establish relationships with the\n\nchildren, “the court might want to consider going to conventional visitation when\n\nenough time has passed to reassure the court of the father’s stability.” It is unclear\n\nfrom the record why no action has apparently been taken to begin Abrams’s plan\n\nof reunification. W. contends in her brief that M. “has made NO attempt at proving\n\nhis ability to act in the best interest of the children, and therefore have access to the\n\nchildren, by simply scheduling an appointment with the children’s counselors to\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fbegin the plan of reunification.” She cites to nothing in the appellate record that\n\nverifies this assertion.\n\n                                    ISSUE ONE\n\n       In his first issue, M. argues that Judge Underwood abused his discretion by\n\ndenying the motion to recuse Judge Walker due to Judge Walker’s alleged “extra-\n\njudicial bias and pervasive antagonism” toward M.

The record of the April 2012 emergency hearing indicates that the\n\ntrial judge initially became angry with M. and skeptical of his testimony when\n\nHoge and Miller contradicted M.’s testimony, and it was at that point when the\n\ntrial judge announced his intention to interview A.K.M. in chambers. By the time\n\nthe trial judge called Hoge and Miller to testify, he had heard M. testify and\n\nobserved M.’s demeanor on the stand for almost three hours. It is clear from the\n\nmanner in which the trial judge conducted the interview with A.K.M. that the trial\n\ncourt disbelieved M.’s testimony concerning A.K.M.’s outcry. However, the record\n\ndoes not demonstrate that the trial judge’s disbelief of M.’s testimony and his\n\nsubsequent displays of anger were derived from an extrajudicial source. Rather, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that the trial judge’s anger, annoyance, frustration, and\n\ndissatisfaction likely derived from his belief that M. had given false testimony.\n\nWhile the trial judge undoubtedly displayed anger and a desire to see M. criminally\n\ninvestigated, his conduct does not demonstrate such a pervasive extrajudicial bias\n\n                                        29\n\for antagonism that required recusal.

With respect to the 529 accounts, M. argues\n\n                                        30\n\fthat no pleadings or evidence support the order. With respect to the attorney’s fees,\n\nM. apparently asserts that no pleadings support an award of any fees other than\n\nthose incurred at the January trial, and he maintains that the trial judge lacked\n\nauthority to award fees for the mandamus proceeding or the recusal proceeding.\n\n      In her counter-petition, W. pleaded for “reasonable attorney’s fees . . .\n\nthrough trial and appeal[;]” therefore, M.’s contention that no pleadings support an\n\naward of attorney’s fees is inaccurate. Section 106.002 of the Family Code\n\nprovides, “In a suit under this title, the court may render judgment for reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees and expenses . . . .” Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 106.002(a) (West\n\n2008). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney’s\n\nfees for the January 2012 custody hearing or the April 2012 emergency hearing.\n\nSee id. However, we conclude that the trial court lacked the authority to award\n\nattorney’s fees for the mandamus proceeding or the recusal proceeding. A\n\nmandamus proceeding is an original appellate proceeding seeking extraordinary\n\nrelief. Tex. R. App. P. 52.1. Although the mandamus was related to the\n\nmodification suit, it was an original, separate proceeding within the jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court.

Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(h).\n\nJudge Underwood did not award attorney’s fees to M., and the trial judge lacked\n\nauthority to assess attorney’s fees for the recusal proceeding. See id.\n\n      With respect to the children’s 529 savings plans, M. argues that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by requiring M. to sign control of the plans over to W.\n\nbecause the trial judge “stated no basis for his order, and there were no pleadings\n\nand no evidence to support it.” As discussed above, in her counter-petition, W.\n\nrequested appointment as sole managing conservator in her counter-petition, and\n\nthe trial court appointed W. sole managing conservator of the children and granted\n\nW. the exclusive right to make decisions concerning the children’s education. The\n\nevidence established that (1) M. opened the plans and was the participant, (2) the\n\ndivorce decree provided that M. would control the 529 college savings plans, and\n\n                                          32\n\f(3) for three years, M. put all of his bonuses into the 529 plans, which totaled\n\napproximately $437,000 at the time of trial. The evidence also established that in\n\n2009, as part of an order permitting M. to transfer the accounts to a different\n\nbrokerage firm, the trial judge enjoined M. from using any of the 529 funds for any\n\npurpose other than a “qualified higher education expense” as defined by the\n\ninvestment plan, and also enjoined M. from changing the beneficiary of any of the\n\naccounts without W.’s express written consent.\n\n      W. contends she “specifically placed the 529 accounts into issue in her\n\nRequest for Additional Relief[,]”which she filed on September 14, 2012, and she\n\nalso points to her general prayer for any and all other relief the trial court\n\ndetermined to be in the children’s best interest and for their protection. In W.’s\n\nrequest for additional relief, she asked that the court order M. to provide statements\n\nfor the 529 accounts to her by certified mail on the first day of each month “to\n\ninsure his fiduciary duties to the children are being met[,]” but she did not request\n\nthat control of the 529 plans be transferred to her. W.’s second amended counter\n\npetition, her live pleading at the time of the hearings, also did not request such\n\nrelief. We conclude that ownership of the 529 savings accounts was not an issue\n\nraised by the pleadings. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by ordering\n\nM. to transfer ownership of the 529 savings accounts to W.

Because the abuse-of-discretion standard of review\n\noverlaps with traditional sufficiency standards of review in family law cases,\n\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence are not independent grounds for\n\nreversal, but instead constitute factors relevant to determining whether the trial\n\njudge abused his discretion. In re A.B.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652706/in-re-abp/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2009, no pet.).\n\n      M. argues that although the order appointed him a possessory conservator,\n\nthe trial court’s order also stripped him of nearly all parental rights and effectively\n\ndenied him all possession of and access to his children, an outcome not supported\n\n                                          36\n\fby sufficient evidence.      M. points out that “while the denial of access is\n\npurportedly ‘temporary,’ the trial court’s order does not provide any enforceable\n\nprovisions for future access. Instead, future access is left to the determination of\n\nthe therapist under a poorly defined ‘transitory program’ leading to a modified\n\npossession order on a date that is also to be determined.”\n\n      A parent of the child has the right to have physical possession of the child.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 151.001(a)(1) (West 2008). Public policy dictates that\n\nchildren will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown\n\nthe ability to act in the children’s best interest. Id. § 153.001(a)(1); In re C.R.O., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377698/in-re-cro/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2002, pet. denied). The trial court must\n\nconsider the best interest of the children, and there is a rebuttable presumption that\n\nappointment of both parents as joint managing conservators is in the children’s\n\nbest interest. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 153.002, 153.131(b). There is also a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the standard possession order is in the children’s best\n\ninterest. Id. § 153.252(2). A finding by the court that a report of abuse made during\n\nthe pendency of a suit affecting the parent-child relationship was false or lacking\n\nfactual foundation may constitute grounds for the court to modify an order\n\nproviding for possession of or access to a child who was the subject of the report\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\fby restricting further access to the child by the person who made the report. Id. §\n\n261.107(b) (emphasis added).\n\n      “The terms of an order that denies possession of a child to a parent or\n\nimposes restrictions or limitations on a parent’s right to possession of or access to a\n\nchild may not exceed those that are required to protect the best interest of the\n\nchild.” Id. § 153.193. A trial court’s discretion to make temporary orders is limited\n\nby a fit parent’s right to exercise his parental rights.

In re J.S.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427923\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427923/in-re-jsp/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2008, no pet.). “[D]elegating specific issues related to possession and access [to a\n\nthird party] appears to be permissible so long as the parent maintains access to\n\ntheir child, and only faces the possibility of the denial of specific periods of\n\npossession.” Id. (emphasis added). A trial court’s ability to obtain assistance from a\n\nthird party is limited by the requirement that the court must maintain the power to\n\nenforce its judgment; that is, the order must be sufficiently specific to be\n\nenforceable by contempt. Id. at 422-23.\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f       In In re J.S.P., the child’s maternal grandmother was named sole managing\n\nconservator, but the appellant father, who suffered cognitive impairment due to a\n\nhead injury prior to J.S.P.’s birth, was permitted supervised visitation. Id. at 417.\n\nThe father subsequently filed a petition to modify, in which he requested\n\nappointment as joint managing conservator with the exclusive right to designate\n\nJ.S.P.’s primary residence, and he requested a standard possession order. Id. The\n\ntrial court entered temporary orders that continued supervised visitation, but on a\n\nschedule. Id. After a jury trial, in which appellant was named a joint managing\n\nconservator along with the grandmother, the trial court conducted a bench trial on\n\nissues of possession and access. Id. At the conclusion of the bench trial, the trial\n\ncourt continued the supervised visitation schedule and ordered the creation by a\n\npsychologist of a transitory program intended to lead to unsupervised visitation by\n\nthe father. Id.\n\n       W. cites In re J.S.P. for the proposition that orders utilizing a mental health\n\nprofessional to develop a transitory program must state a date by which the\n\ntransitory program should be developed, a date by which the standard possession\n\norder should begin, or a deadline by which the therapist must report reasons why\n\nthe transitory program could not be developed or why standard possession should\n\nnot commence. W. argues that the order the trial court entered in this case meets\n\n                                          39\n\fthe requirements set forth in In re J.S.P. W. ignores the fact that In re J.S.P. did\n\nnot involve depriving the father of all rights of visitation and access. See id. at 417-\n\n23.\n\n      We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the\n\ntrial court’s determination that the standard possession order would not be in the\n\nchildren’s best interest. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the trial\n\ncourt’s order forbidding M. from contacting the children and denying M. all rights\n\nof possession and access, even on an ostensibly temporary basis. See generally\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 153.193; Moore v. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied) (In family law cases, sufficiency of the evidence\n\nissues are relevant factors in determining whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion.); In re A.B.P., 291 S.W.3d at 95. The trial court therefore abused its\n\ndiscretion by forbidding M. from contacting the children and denying M. all rights\n\nof possession or access. Accordingly, we sustain issue nine in part, reverse the\n\nportions of the trial court’s order that provide that M. have no visitation or access\n\nto the children and that M. cannot contact the children, and remand the case to the\n\ntrial court for entry of an appropriate order consistent with this opinion. The trial\n\ncourt may consider the recommendations set forth in Dr. Abrams’s February 2013\n\nreport; however, we will leave the specific terms of visitation and access to the trial\n\n                                          40\n\fcourt’s discretion.
