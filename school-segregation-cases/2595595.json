He was sentenced to a total of 70 years’ imprisonment. On\n\nappeal, the defendant argues that: (1) he was not convicted beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the\n\ntrial court erred in admitting gang-related evidence; and (3) he was deprived of the effective\n\nassistance of counsel. We affirm.\n\n¶2                                    BACKGROUND\n\n¶3     On June 23, 2010, the defendant and his brother Isaac were charged by indictment with\n\nthe first-degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) (West 2010)) of Demarkis Robinson\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nand the attempted first-degree murder (720 ILCS 5/8-4(a), 9-1(a)(1) (West 2010)) of William\n\nPatrick. The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the brothers’ trials.\n\n¶4      Between September 24 and 27, 2012, the trial court conducted a jury trial. The State’s\n\nevidence established that Patrick had prior convictions of mob action and possession of a firearm\n\nwithout a firearm owner’s identification (FOID) card and that he was a member of the Insane\n\nUnknowns street gang. That gang was a rival of the Latin Kings. Robinson was his close friend\n\nand also a member of the Insane Unknowns.\n\n¶5      On May 27, 2010, Patrick and his aunt, Wanda Perez, were visiting his grandmother’s\n\nhouse at 1129 6th Avenue in Rockford. Robinson was also there. Robinson spent time on the\n\nfront porch with Patrick, Perez, and other family members. While on the porch, Perez noticed a\n\ngray Tahoe sport utility vehicle (SUV) quickly approach and then stop near the 8th Street and 6th\n\nAvenue intersection. Because its approach grabbed her attention, she told Patrick and Robinson\n\nto watch the SUV. Patrick watched it drive past the house slowly, with the driver’s side of the\n\nvehicle facing the house. Perez momentarily played with her phone, but when she looked up she\n\nnoticed the driver make a hand gesture with two fingers pointing downward. Perez did not\n\nclosely view the vehicle’s occupants. Perez believed that the gesture was a gang sign. Both\n\nRobinson and Patrick were present when the gesture was made. Patrick explained that the hand\n\ngesture was an act of disrespect to the Insane Unknowns. Then, Patrick observed the driver\n\ndisplay a gang sign for the Latin Kings. Patrick testified that the driver’s hand gestures were\n\ngrounds to start a fight.\n\n¶6      Patrick took his nieces into the house because “anything could start to happen.” The\n\nTahoe was traveling toward 7th Street, but Robinson and Patrick walked toward 9th Street.\n\nShortly after Robinson and Patrick left, Perez heard what sounded like one close gunshot. She\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nthen called Robinson’s father, Samuel, and told him that she heard a gunshot and that Robinson\n\nand Patrick were running toward his house. The call was made at 3 p.m.\n\n¶7     Patrick and Robinson passed through an alley and turned onto 5th Avenue. When they\n\nexited the alley 15 to 20 minutes after first seeing the Tahoe, Patrick, while speaking on his\n\nphone, saw the Tahoe, with the same driver, pass them very slowly. Patrick observed that the\n\npassenger had a bandana around his face, which signified to Patrick that the occupants of the\n\nTahoe were going to start shooting. Patrick picked up a brick and threw it at the Tahoe so that it\n\nwould keep moving. Geraldine Horton was walking by as this occurred. (Horton had previously\n\nbeen convicted of drug-related charges and she had other charges pending against her.) She\n\nheard glass break and saw the SUV stop a few feet before a stop sign. Lacressa Dangel was\n\ndriving by as this occurred. (Dangel had previously been convicted of prostitution, theft, and\n\ndrug-related charges. She also had traffic charges pending against her.) Dangel felt and saw\n\nsomething hit the back of her car on her northbound journey along 9th Street, between 2:45 and 3\n\np.m. She stopped her car north of 5th Avenue and saw a silver SUV facing west on 5th Avenue.\n\nShe observed the scene unfold through her rearview mirror.\n\n¶8     Horton, Patrick, and Dangel watched as: (1) the Tahoe’s passenger door opened; (2) a\n\npassenger exited and walked toward the back of the vehicle; and (3) the passenger used two\n\nhands to hold, point, and fire a firearm four or five times. Dangel believed that the gun looked\n\nlike a skinny BB gun and that the shooter was a Hispanic male. Patrick believed that the firearm\n\nlooked like a rifle, and he heard five to eight shots fired. He ducked behind a tree, and Robinson\n\nveered off into an alleyway.\n\n¶9     After the passenger stopped firing, he returned inside the waiting vehicle, and the vehicle\n\nsped off down 5th Avenue. Horton saw the driver as he passed; his eyes were wide open, and he\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\ngripped the steering wheel with locked and tensed arms. Horton later told the police that the\n\ndriver looked scared. At trial, she testified that the driver was surprised to see her. She\n\ndescribed both the driver and the passenger as Hispanic.\n\n¶ 10   In response to the phone call from Perez, Samuel ran toward the area where the shots\n\nwere fired. About 15 to 20 minutes later, Samuel found Robinson’s shirt and then saw Robinson\n\nlying naked under a faucet. Samuel picked up the clothing from the yard and brought it to his\n\nson. Samuel saw that Robinson was in and out of consciousness and he called 911. Robinson\n\nthen told Samuel, “that damn Richard shot me.” From a previous discussion with his son,\n\nSamuel had learned that Richard and Robinson had been in a fight at Rockford East High\n\nSchool, Richard was a Latin King who attended East High School, and Robinson had\n\nencountered Richard at Perez’s mother’s house a month before the shooting.\n\n¶ 11   Police officers responded to the scene and discovered five spent .22-caliber shell casings\n\nin the street. The casings were run over and deformed, but they were in a small grouping.\n\nRobinson was transported to SwedishAmerican Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\n¶ 12   On May 28, 2010, Dr. Mark Peters performed an autopsy on Robinson. Dr. Peters opined\n\nthat Robinson died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen that caused internal bleeding,\n\nhemorrhagic shock, and blood loss. Though such an injury could cause instant death, a person\n\ncould walk and live with such an injury for 30 minutes before dying. Dr. Peters recovered from\n\nRobinson’s body a bullet that appeared consistent with .22-caliber ammunition.\n\n¶ 13   On May 28, 2010, Patrick spoke to Rockford police officers about the incident and gave\n\nhis statement. He was upset, shaking, and crying. In his statement, Patrick did not mention that\n\nhe threw a brick at the silver Tahoe or that Robinson walked up to the vehicle and spoke to the\n\noccupants. Though he had not seen the driver before, Patrick knew that the driver was a Latin\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nKing, based upon the display of the Latin Kings’ gang sign. From a photo array, Patrick\n\nidentified the defendant as the driver of the Tahoe and Isaac as the shooter.\n\n¶ 14   Also on May 28, 2010, Rockford police officers interviewed Dangel. She identified Isaac\n\nas the shooter. She was not able to identify the driver of the vehicle.\n\n¶ 15   On May 29, 2010, the police arrested both the defendant and Isaac.               The police\n\ndiscovered the defendant’s Tahoe at the house where he was arrested. When the Tahoe was\n\ninspected, the police found a spent .22-caliber casing under the rear passenger seat.\n\n¶ 16   Patrick and Perez subsequently identified the defendant’s Tahoe as the one they saw on\n\nthe day of the shooting. Both Horton and Dangel told the police that the defendant’s Tahoe\n\nlooked like the one involved in the shooting.\n\n¶ 17   Illinois State Police forensic scientist David Welte compared the five spent cartridges\n\nfound on the street with the one found in the Tahoe. He concluded that all six casings were fired\n\nfrom the same .22-caliber firearm. Although he determined that the bullet recovered from\n\nRobinson was the same caliber as the six casings, he could not determine if it was fired from the\n\nsame firearm, because, as the firearm used in the shooting was never recovered, he was not able\n\nto compare it to that firearm.\n\n¶ 18   On February 7, 2011, Patrick went to the office of the defendant’s attorney, David Vella.\n\nHe was accompanied by someone who identified himself as a Vice Lord from Chicago. Patrick\n\ntold Vella that the written statement he had given to the police was false and that he had laughed\n\nwhen it was read. He told Vella that he could not identify the driver or the shooter, because\n\nhoods and masks covered their faces. At trial, Patrick testified that his statement to Vella was\n\nfalse and that he had made it because he had been threatened.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 19   In September 2012, Patrick told an assistant State’s Attorney that he did not want to\n\ntestify. Patrick explained that people had threatened him. He was concerned about his safety.\n\nPatrick indicated that he could still identify the driver of the Tahoe from a photo array, but not\n\nthe shooter. (At trial, he testified that he could identify the shooter as well.) Patrick also made\n\nno reference to Robinson talking to the occupants of the Tahoe. (At trial, he testified that\n\nRobinson and the occupants said a couple of words when the vehicle first pulled up.)\n\n¶ 20   The State introduced evidence that the defendant was a Latin King. Specifically, Gary\n\nAnderson, a Winnebago County corrections officer, said that the defendant told him that he was\n\na Latin King and that he needed to be segregated from other gangs. The State also introduced\n\ntestimony from Rockford police officer Marc Posley, an expert on street gangs. He explained\n\nthe significance of gang members’ hand gestures and their rivalries with other gangs.\n\n¶ 21   Following the denial of his motion for a directed verdict, the defendant presented two\n\nwitnesses. Rockford police officer Courtney Tillman Listhrup, a school liaison officer at East\n\nHigh School, testified that on May 14, 2010, Isaac complained to her that someone had broken\n\nthe driver’s-side and rear windows of his Chevy Suburban. Officer Jeffrey Schroder was called\n\nto impeach Patrick’s testimony.\n\n¶ 22   At the close of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree murder and\n\nattempted first-degree murder. Following the denial of his posttrial motion, the trial court\n\nsentenced the defendant to a total of 70 years’ imprisonment. The defendant thereafter filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal.\n\n¶ 23                                       ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 24   The defendant’s first contention on appeal is that he was not convicted beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Specifically, the defendant argues that the State failed to prove that he was\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\npresent at the shooting or that he possessed the requisite intent for convictions of the charged\n\noffenses.\n\n¶ 25   It is not the province of this court to retry the defendant. People v. Collins, 106 Ill. 2d\n\n237, 261 (1985). The relevant question is “ ‘whether, after viewing the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ ” (Emphasis in original.) Id. (quoting\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). “The sufficiency of the evidence and the relative\n\nweight and credibility to be given the testimony of the witnesses are considerations within the\n\nexclusive jurisdiction of the fact finder.” People v. Atherton, 406 Ill. App. 3d 598, 608 (2010).\n\nThe evaluation of the testimony and the resolution of any conflicts or inconsistencies that appear\n\nare also wholly within the province of the finder of fact. Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261-62.\n\n¶ 26   The offense of first-degree murder is shown when the State proves, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that, in performing the acts that cause the death of an individual, the defendant “either\n\nintends to kill or do great bodily harm to that individual or another, or knows that such acts will\n\ncause death to that individual or another.” 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) (West 2010).\n\n¶ 27   The offense of attempted murder is shown when the State proves, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that the defendant, with the specific intent to kill, commits any act that constitutes a\n\nsubstantial step toward the commission of murder. 720 ILCS 5/8-4, 9-1 (West 2010). The\n\nquestion of a defendant’s intent is one of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact, and can be\n\ninferred from the surrounding circumstances, such as the character of the attack, the use of a\n\ndeadly weapon, and the severity of injury. People v. Valentin, 347 Ill. App. 3d 946, 951 (2004).\n\n¶ 28   Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we first address whether\n\nthe evidence established that the defendant was the driver of the vehicle involved in the shooting.\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nWe believe that it did. Patrick identified the defendant as the driver, one day after the murder\n\nand at trial. Patrick and Dangel identified Isaac as the passenger. Patrick and Perez identified\n\nthe defendant’s vehicle as the one involved in the shooting. Horton and Dangel indicated that\n\nthe defendant’s vehicle looked similar to the one involved in the shooting. Further, a shell casing\n\nfound in the defendant’s vehicle matched the casings recovered at the crime scene. Based on this\n\nevidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that (1) the defendant’s vehicle was at the shooting;\n\n(2) Isaac was the passenger in the vehicle; and (3) the defendant was driving the vehicle.\n\n¶ 29   In so ruling, we reject the defendant’s argument that, because Patrick gave numerous\n\naccounts as to what occurred, and because of his bias against the Latin Kings, his testimony was\n\nnot credible. We note that all of the inconsistencies in his statements as well as his bias against\n\nthe Latin Kings were brought to the jury’s attention. Further, other than the statement that he\n\nmade to Vella, which the circumstances suggest was made under duress, he consistently\n\nidentified the defendant as the driver of the vehicle. It was within the purview of the jury to\n\ndetermine that Patrick’s identification of the defendant was credible. See Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at\n\n261-62.\n\n¶ 30   We also reject the defendant’s argument that Patrick did not have a sufficient opportunity\n\nto observe who was driving the vehicle. In assessing identification testimony, a court considers\n\nthe following factors: (1) the witness’s opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime;\n\n(2) the witness’s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior description of the\n\ncriminal; (4) the witness’s level of certainty at the identification confrontation; and (5) the length\n\nof time between the crime and the identification confrontation. Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188,\n\n199-200 (1972); People v. Slim, 127 Ill. 2d 302, 307-08 (1989). The trier of fact determines the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nweight to be given identification testimony. People v. Calderon, 369 Ill. App. 3d 221, 232\n\n(2006).\n\n¶ 31      As to the first factor, Patrick twice encountered the defendant in daylight on a “hot, nice\n\nday.” When the defendant first drove past Patrick and Robinson, the driver’s side of the vehicle\n\nfaced them and the windows were rolled down. Patrick saw the driver flash gang signs. Around\n\n2:45 p.m., as Patrick exited the alley onto 5th Avenue while speaking on his phone, he saw the\n\nTahoe, with the same driver, slowly passing again. Thus, Patrick’s testimony demonstrated that\n\nhe observed the defendant prior to the shooting without any obstruction. See People v. Masse,\n\n237 Ill. App. 3d 348, 354 (1992). Because Patrick had two chances to see the defendant in broad\n\ndaylight, the jury could reasonably conclude that Patrick had a sufficient opportunity to observe\n\nthe defendant.\n\n¶ 32      As to the second factor, the defendant argues that Patrick’s degree of attention was\n\ninsufficient to allow him to make a positive identification of the defendant. Specifically, the\n\ndefendant contends that Patrick’s cell-phone use distracted him during the shooting. We note\n\nthat, although Patrick was using his cell phone during his second encounter with the vehicle, he\n\nwas not using it during the first encounter, when he observed the vehicle from the porch. The\n\njury could conclude that Patrick was paying sufficient attention to what was occurring so as to\n\nidentify the defendant.\n\n¶ 33      As to the third factor—the accuracy of the witness’s description—there was no detailed\n\ntestimony. The record indicates only that Patrick described the events to police officers a day\n\nafter the shooting.\n\n¶ 34      As to the fourth factor—the witness’s level of certainty—we note that Patrick identified\n\nthe defendant one day after the incident and again at trial. The defendant asserts that Patrick’s\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nidentification was uncertain, because his identification statements equivocated during the two-\n\nyear span before trial. However, the only time that Patrick could not identify the defendant was\n\nwhen he gave a statement of recantation to Vella. Recantation statements are highly suspect and\n\nunreliable. People v. Brooks, 187 Ill. 2d 91, 132 (1999). As such, the jury was free to reject\n\nPatrick’s recantation statement and find sufficient certainty from his other statements and his\n\ntrial testimony.\n\n¶ 35   Finally, as to the fifth factor—the length of time between the crime and the\n\nidentification—Patrick identified the defendant only one day after the murder occurred. This\n\nclearly supports a finding that the identification was valid.      Cf. Slim, 127 Ill. 2d at 313\n\n(determining that identification made 11 days after crime supported finding that identification\n\nwas valid).\n\n¶ 36   We next address the defendant’s argument that the State failed to prove the defendant\n\naccountable for the offenses because it failed to present any evidence that the defendant intended\n\nto aid and abet a murder and an attempted murder.\n\n¶ 37   To sustain a conviction based upon an accountability theory, the State must establish that\n\nthe defendant: (1) solicited, ordered, abetted, or agreed or attempted to aid another in the\n\nplanning or commission of the offense; (2) participated before or during the commission of the\n\noffense; and (3) had the concurrent, specific intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the\n\noffense. 720 ILCS 5/5-2(c) (West 2010); People v. Craigen, 2013 IL App (2d) 111300, ¶ 33. To\n\nprove intent, the State must present evidence that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the\n\nprincipal or that there was a common criminal design. People v. Fernandez, 2014 IL 115527, ¶\n\n13.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 38   While mere presence at the scene of a crime, alone, does not render a person accountable,\n\nit is a factor that may be considered with other circumstances when the trier of fact determines\n\naccountability. 720 ILCS 5/5-2(c) (West 2010). Other factors that may be considered are the\n\nmaintenance of a close affiliation with the companion after the commission of the crime, flight\n\nfrom the scene, and the failure to report the crime. Craigen, 2013 IL App (2d) 111300, ¶ 33.\n\nActive participation in the offense is not a requirement for guilt under a theory of accountability.\n\nPeople v. Taylor, 164 Ill. 2d 131, 140 (1995). A jury can infer a defendant’s accountability from\n\nhis approving presence at the scene of the crime and from evidence of conduct showing a design\n\non the defendant’s part to aid in the offense. People v. Tinoco, 185 Ill. App. 3d 816, 823 (1989).\n\nFurther, to obtain a conviction based on accountability, the State must prove that the principal\n\nactually committed the offense. People v. Chirchirillo, 393 Ill. App. 3d 916, 922 (2009).\n\n¶ 39   Again, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we believe that the\n\njury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of murder and\n\nattempted murder under a theory of accountability. The evidence indicates that the defendant\n\ninstigated the altercation when he disparaged the gang that Robinson and Patrick were in. Based\n\non Samuel’s testimony, the jury could find that the defendant knew that Robinson was in a rival\n\ngang and that Robinson would find his hand gestures insulting. Patrick explained that the\n\ndefendant’s actions indicated that he was looking to start a fight. Consistent with this perceived\n\ndesire to start a fight, the defendant was driving very slowly while Isaac was wearing a bandana\n\naround his face and holding a rifle. Patrick explained that Isaac’s wearing the bandana indicated\n\nthat he was about to start shooting. After Patrick threw a brick at the defendant’s vehicle, the\n\ndefendant stopped abruptly, which allowed Isaac to get out of the vehicle and shoot at both\n\nRobinson and Patrick. The defendant drove away quickly after Isaac returned to the vehicle.\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nBased on all of this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant intended to aid\n\nand abet the murder of Robinson and the attempted murder of Patrick.\n\n¶ 40   In so ruling, we note that the defendant correctly points out that flashing gang symbols\n\ndoes not by itself establish an intent to commit a crime. See People v. Gonzalez, 142 Ill. 2d 481,\n\n485 (1991) (citing instances of flashing gang symbols that did not immediately precede violent\n\naltercations). Similarly, a defendant’s knowledge that his passenger has a gun does not establish\n\nby itself that the defendant approved of his passenger using that gun to commit a crime. See\n\nPeople v. 186 Ill. 2d 439, 448 (1999) (driver found not guilty of aggravated discharge of a\n\nfirearm even when he knew that his passenger had a gun). However, in Gonzalez and Taylor, the\n\ndefendant’s actions were much less indicative of an intent to assist with the commission of a\n\ncrime. As set forth above, considering the totality of the defendant’s conduct in this case, the\n\njury could infer that the defendant aided and abetted Isaac in committing the charged crimes.\n\n¶ 41   The defendant further argues that the State did not establish that he and Isaac were acting\n\nin concert, because it did not establish that Isaac was in a gang. The defendant contends that, as\n\nIsaac was the alleged principal in a “gang-related” shooting, Isaac’s lack of gang status was\n\nrelevant. Because there was no evidence that Isaac was a gang member, the defendant insists\n\nthat there is absolutely nothing that proves that he should have known that Isaac intended to step\n\nout of the Tahoe and shoot at two people who were not his rivals.\n\n¶ 42   Although the record does not establish that Isaac and the defendant were in the same\n\ngang, the evidence does establish that the defendant and Isaac are brothers. The jury could\n\nreasonably infer that Isaac and the defendant’s familial relationship was a basis for them to work\n\nin concert. Moreover, even absent a shared gang affiliation, there was other evidence that\n\nsuggested that the defendant was aware of and approved of Isaac’s plan to shoot at the victims.\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nAs described above, the defendant instigated the altercation by flashing provocative gang\n\nsymbols at the victims. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was slowly driving by the victims while\n\nIsaac was wearing a bandana across his face and was armed with a rifle. It would be counter to\n\nhuman experience for the jury to conclude that the defendant was not aware that Isaac was about\n\nto commit a crime. See People v. Calahan, 272 Ill. App. 3d 293, 299-300 (1995) (explaining\n\nthat it is a well-recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the perpetrator will seek to conceal his\n\nidentity). The defendant gave Isaac an opportunity to shoot at the victims when he stopped his\n\nvehicle abruptly. He then fled from the scene and did not report the crime. These circumstances\n\nsupport a finding that the defendant was accountable for Isaac’s actions.\n\n¶ 43    The defendant also emphasizes that one cannot be found guilty on a theory of\n\naccountability if the principal is not guilty. See Chirchirillo, 393 Ill. App. 3d at 922. He points\n\nout that Isaac was acquitted of the charged offenses. However, just because a different jury\n\nacquitted Isaac does not mean that the jury in the instant case could not find that he was in fact\n\nthe shooter. Cf. People v. Martinez, 389 Ill. App. 3d 413, 418 (2009) (acquittal of a codefendant\n\ndoes not establish the defendant’s innocence and should not be given conclusive effect against\n\nthe State in favor of a stranger to that trial).\n\n¶ 44    Further, the defendant points out that, after the shooting, Horton described the driver as\n\nappearing scared. The defendant argues that the logical inference from this observation was that\n\nthe driver was scared at what the shooter was doing and that he did not acquiesce in the shooter’s\n\nactions. An equally plausible inference, however, was that the driver was scared or surprised at\n\nseeing someone who might be able to identify him later as having been involved in the crime.\n\nOf course, it was for the jury to determine which of these competing inferences was correct.\n\nPeople v. Janik, 127 Ill. 2d 390, 401 (2001).\n\n\n                                                   - 13 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 45    The defendant next argues that he was deprived of a fair trial when Samuel falsely\n\ntestified that his son’s dying words were “that damn Ricardo shot me.” The defendant contends\n\nthat, because the evidence against him was so threadbare, Samuel’s false testimony necessarily\n\nhad a devastating impact on the fairness of his trial. The defendant insists that the trial court\n\ntherefore erred in not granting a mistrial sua sponte.\n\n¶ 46    Prior to trial, the trial court ruled that Robinson’s statement to Samuel, “that damn\n\nRichard shot me,” would be admissible as a dying declaration. At trial, on direct examination,\n\nSamuel testified that Robinson’s statement was “that damn Ricardo shot me.” Samuel then\n\ntestified to how his son was taken to a hospital and how he subsequently learned that his son had\n\ndied.   At this point, defense counsel objected, arguing that Samuel’s testimony, using the\n\ndefendant’s name, “Ricardo,” was substantially different from the statement using the name\n\n“Richard,” which the trial court had allowed as a dying declaration. The trial court responded\n\nthat defense counsel could cross-examine Samuel as to the exact name that Robinson had used.\n\nAfter the trial court’s ruling, the State asked for “the record [to] reflect that [Samuel] is clearly\n\ndistraught on the witness stand, weeping, audibly sobbing.” On cross-examination, Samuel\n\nacknowledged that the name his son had actually used was “Richard.”\n\n¶ 47    Even where defense counsel does not request a mistrial, the trial court has the discretion\n\nto grant one. People v. Monroe, 366 Ill. App. 3d 1080, 1094 (2006); see also People v. Williams,\n\n201 Ill. App. 3d 207, 221 (1990) (the trial court has the responsibility to see that the proceedings\n\nare conducted in an orderly manner with proper decorum, and the control of the conduct of the\n\ntrial rests within its discretion). However, we do not believe that the trial court here abused its\n\ndiscretion in not granting a mistrial. See People v. Sambo, 197 Ill. App. 3d 574, 584 (1990)\n\n(determining that whether to order a mistrial is within the trial court’s discretion). Although the\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\ndefendant complains about Samuel’s “highly emotional” testimony that Robinson identified the\n\ndefendant (“Ricardo”) as the person who shot him, the record is not clear as to whether Samuel\n\nwas “clearly distraught” when discussing his son’s dying declaration or when discussing how he\n\nlearned of his son’s death. In any event, the trial court was in a better position to assess whether\n\nSamuel’s “highly emotional” testimony had an improper effect on the jury. See People v.\n\nBeltran, 2011 IL App (2d) 090856, ¶ 68 (trial court was in better position to assess whether\n\nprosecutor’s use of an “emotional voice” improperly inflamed the passions of the jury or\n\nprejudiced the defendant); see also People v. Davis, 378 Ill. App. 3d 1, 13 (2007) (trial court is in\n\nfar superior position than reviewing court to assess witness’s tone of voice). Based on this\n\nrecord, we believe that the trial’s court handling of this issue—allowing defense counsel to bring\n\nout on cross-examination that in fact Robinson had identified “Richard,” not “Ricardo,” as his\n\nshooter—did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n\n¶ 48   The defendant’s next contention on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it allowed evidence of his past gang activity. The defendant argues that, since he had\n\nalready conceded his gang affiliation, such evidence constituted improper character evidence,\n\nwhich deprived him of a fair trial.\n\n¶ 49   In response, the State argues that this issue is forfeited because the defendant did not raise\n\nit at trial or in his posttrial motion. However, a review of the record indicates that the defendant\n\npreserved this issue by raising it both at trial and in his posttrial motion. Thus, we will consider\n\nthe merits of his contention.\n\n¶ 50   The State presented four witnesses to establish that the defendant was in the Latin Kings\n\nstreet gang. Gary Anderson testified that on June 4, 2010, the defendant approached him and\n\ninformed him that he was a Latin King and that “he needed to stay away from other gangs.”\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 51     Westley Kemp of the Winnebago County sheriff’s department testified that he was\n\nassigned to Harlem High School as a school resource officer. On January 22, 2008, he learned\n\nthat graffiti had been discovered in one of the bathrooms. The defendant acknowledged that he\n\nhad drawn the markings.\n\n¶ 52     John Anderson testified that he worked at a juvenile detention center. On October 15,\n\n2006, he conducted a booking interview with the defendant. The defendant indicated that he was\n\na member of the Latin Kings.\n\n¶ 53     Posley testified that he had specialized training in street gangs. He was familiar with\n\ngang symbols, handshakes, hand gestures, codes, territories, and other indicia. He described the\n\nsymbols and hand gestures of the Latin Kings and the Insane Unknowns. He described those\n\ntwo gangs as rivals. Posley reviewed a picture that the defendant had drawn in the Harlem High\n\nSchool bathroom on January 22, 2008, and he testified that the markings were Latin Kings\n\ngraffiti. Based on the defendant’s drawing the graffiti as well as telling John Anderson and Gary\n\nAnderson of his gang affiliation, Posley believed that the defendant was a member of the Latin\n\nKings.\n\n¶ 54     Although jurors might have negative feelings about street gangs, it is not necessary to\n\nexclude gang-affiliation evidence if it is otherwise relevant and admissible. People v. Blue, 205\n\nIll. 2d 1, 15 (2001). Evidence that relates to the defendant’s gang membership or activities may\n\nbe admitted at trial, despite its prejudicial effect, to establish a common purpose or design or to\n\nprovide a motive for an otherwise inexplicable act. People v. Patterson, 154 Ill. 2d 414, 458\n\n(1992); People v. Knox, 241 Ill. App. 3d 205, 211 (1993). Relevant gang-related evidence is not\n\nexcluded simply because it is prejudicial; rather, it is admissible as long as it is relevant to an\n\nissue in dispute and its probative value is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nPeople v. Johnson, 208 Ill. 2d 53, 102 (2003); Knox, 241 Ill. App. 3d at 211. A trial court’s\n\ndecision regarding the admission of gang-related evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse\n\nof discretion. People v. Villarreal, 198 Ill. 2d 209, 232 (2001).\n\n¶ 55   We do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the gang-related\n\nevidence. The State’s theory of why the defendant and Robinson were involved in an altercation\n\nat school was that they were in rival gangs. Gary Anderson’s and John Anderson’s testimony\n\nwas therefore relevant, as both testified that the defendant had identified himself to them as a\n\nLatin King. Posley’s testimony was relevant, as it established that, not only did the defendant\n\nclaim to be a Latin King, he acted like a Latin King when he drew Latin Kings graffiti at school.\n\nPosley’s testimony that the Latin Kings and the Insane Unknowns were rival gangs was also\n\nclearly relevant. See People v. Hamilton, 328 Ill. App. 3d 195, 202 (2002) (evidence of gang\n\nmembership and rivalries is relevant when it establishes reasons for deadly gang behavior).\n\n¶ 56   In so ruling, we reject the defendant’s argument that the presentation of any gang-related\n\nevidence was unnecessary, and therefore unduly prejudicial, because defense counsel conceded\n\nin opening statements that the defendant was in a gang. Opening statements are not evidence.\n\nDefense counsel’s concession did not preclude the State from presenting evidence to support its\n\ntheory of the case. See People v. Mason, 274 Ill. App. 3d 715, 723 (1995) (State had the right to\n\npresent evidence that the defendant was a gang member, in order to demonstrate motive).\n\n¶ 57   We also find that the defendant overstates how “excessive” the State’s gang-related\n\nevidence was. Gary Anderson and John Anderson testified to little more than that the defendant\n\nhad identified himself as a Latin King. Kemp testified that the defendant had acknowledged\n\ndrawing graffiti in the school bathroom. Posley’s testimony, although more extensive, pertained\n\nonly to the issues in the case (significance of gang hand gestures and symbols, rivalries between\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\ngangs). We do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing such evidence to\n\nestablish the defendant’s gang affiliation. Cf. id. at 720-22 (gang-related evidence found to be\n\nexcessive where State presented evidence that had no bearing on case, such as elements of gang\n\nlife and details on various Chicago gangs and their affiliations with two large national\n\norganizations).\n\n¶ 58   The defendant further asserts that evidence that he had been at a juvenile detention center\n\nwas improper in light of our supreme court’s decisions in People v. Villa, 2011 IL 110777, ¶ 41,\n\nand People v. Montgomery, 47 Ill. 2d 510 (1971). In those cases, our supreme court held that\n\njuvenile adjudications are not admissible against a defendant unless they are used to impeach a\n\ntestifying defendant who has misled the jury about his criminal history or opened the door by\n\ntestifying about his prior adjudications. Villa, 2011 IL 110777, ¶¶ 46, 49; Montgomery, 47 Ill.\n\n2d at 516. The defendant acknowledges that the State did not actually introduce any evidence of\n\na juvenile adjudication. However, he complains that evidence of his interaction with a juvenile\n\ndetention officer was just as bad because “[c]ommon sense dictates that one is not subject to\n\ndetention as a juvenile without some process and adjudication for wrongdoing.”\n\n¶ 59   We find the defendant’s argument unpersuasive. As noted above, the State had the right\n\nto present evidence that the defendant was in a gang. See Mason, 274 Ill. App. 3d at 723. In\n\npresenting that evidence, the State also had the obligation to provide a proper foundation for it.\n\nSee People v. Nieves, 193 Ill. 2d 513, 537-38 (2000) (testimony that lacks a proper foundation as\n\nto the witness’s personal knowledge of events amounts to no evidence at all). Thus, it was not\n\nimproper for the State to solicit John Anderson’s testimony that he was working at a juvenile\n\ndetention facility when he learned from the defendant that the defendant was a Latin King.\n\nMoreover, the testimony was minimal, as Anderson did not testify to why the defendant was at\n\n\n                                              - 18 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nthe juvenile detention facility. Cf. People v. Markiewicz, 246 Ill. App. 3d 31, 40 (1993) (trial\n\ncourt does not err where it carefully limits evidence of other crimes to that which is relevant to\n\nthe issues on which the other-crime evidence is admitted). As neither Knox nor Montgomery\n\nbarred the evidence at issue, and as the evidence was limited to the defendant’s identifying\n\nhimself as a Latin King, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting that\n\nevidence. See Villarreal, 198 Ill. 2d at 232.\n\n¶ 60   That being said, we do not believe that it was necessary for the State to introduce John\n\nAnderson’s testimony, because it was duplicative of Gary Anderson’s testimony, i.e, the\n\ndefendant identified himself as a Latin King. Just because a prosecutor can introduce certain\n\nevidence does not mean that he or she should.             The prosecutor’s interest in a criminal\n\nprosecution “ ‘is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.’ ” Strickler v. Greene,\n\n527 U.S. 263, 281 (1999) (quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935)). Although\n\nwe have determined that the gang-related evidence described above was not excessive to the\n\npoint of being unduly prejudicial, we believe that the evidence was close to crossing that\n\nforbidden threshold. We therefore urge the State to be more circumspect in its use of such\n\ncumulative evidence in similar cases in the future.\n\n¶ 61   The defendant’s final contention on appeal is that he was deprived of the effective\n\nassistance of counsel.    Specifically, he argues that defense counsel was ineffective for (1)\n\neliciting evidence in support of the State’s case and (2) proceeding with a strategy that, if taken\n\nto its logical conclusion, supported the State’s theory of the defendant’s guilt.\n\n¶ 62   In his opening statement, defense counsel asserted that the jury might be presented with\n\ncredible evidence that (1) Isaac was at the scene of the crime; (2) Isaac had a motive to be there;\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nand (3) the defendant’s vehicle was there. However, defense counsel insisted that there would be\n\nno credible evidence that the defendant was there or that he had any motive to help Isaac.\n\n¶ 63    In questioning Samuel, defense counsel elicited testimony that Robinson had been in a\n\nfight with “Richard” at East High School and that “Richard” was a Latin King. Defense counsel\n\nelicited from Lithsrup that, at school on May 14, 2010, Isaac complained to her that someone had\n\nbroken windows on his Chevy Suburban.\n\n¶ 64    In closing arguments, defense counsel argued that “Richard really is Isaac.” He noted\n\nthat Isaac and Robinson went to the same high school. Defense counsel argued that Isaac had a\n\nmotive to shoot Robinson, because he “was getting revenge for his car windows getting broken\n\nout.”   Defense counsel then pointed to both Robinson’s dying declaration and Dangel’s\n\ntestimony that Isaac was in fact the one who had shot Robinson. Defense counsel further argued\n\nthat the defendant’s vehicle’s presence at the scene did not mean that the defendant was there.\n\nDefense counsel further insisted that the defendant had no motive to shoot Robinson and that\n\nthere was no proof that he had helped Isaac.\n\n¶ 65    In reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the standards set forth in\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), apply. People v. Albanese, 104 Ill. 2d 504, 526-\n\n27 (1984).    To succeed on such a claim, a defendant must show both that his counsel’s\n\nperformance “fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688)\n\nand that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result\n\nof the proceeding would have been different” (id. at 694). A defendant is entitled to competent\n\nrepresentation, not perfect representation. People v. West, 187 Ill. 2d 418, 432 (1999). Errors in\n\nstrategy do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. People v. Gonzalez, 407 Ill. App. 3d\n\n1026, 1038 (2011). Only when a strategic decision is shown to be so ill-chosen that it permeates\n\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nthe entire trial with obvious unfairness will the strategy constitute ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. People v. Manning, 241 Ill. 2d 319, 343 (2011).\n\n¶ 66   Here, we do not believe that defense counsel’s strategy rose to the level of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. Defense counsel was confronted with some difficult evidence: two\n\nwitnesses placed Isaac at the scene of the crime and four witnesses placed the defendant’s\n\nvehicle there. Rather than argue that all of those witnesses were mistaken, and thereby possibly\n\nundermine his own credibility, defense counsel chose to concede that evidence and instead argue\n\nthat there was no credible evidence that placed the defendant himself at the scene of the crime.\n\nAs Patrick was the State’s only witness who placed the defendant at the crime scene—and as he\n\ngave multiple conflicting accounts about what happened on the day in question―defense\n\ncounsel’s strategy that focused on attacking Patrick’s credibility was not unreasonable.\n\n¶ 67   In so ruling, we reject the defendant’s argument that defense counsel was ineffective for\n\neliciting evidence that Isaac had an independent motive to kill Robinson, i.e., revenge. Although\n\ndefense counsel, not the State, presented evidence that provided a motive for Isaac’s actions, the\n\nrecord indicates that this was part of defense counsel’s strategy to point all of the blame away\n\nfrom the defendant and toward Isaac. This evidence did not help the State prove part of its case\n\nthat it otherwise failed to prove. Cf. People v. Jackson, 318 Ill. App. 3d 321, 327-28 (2000)\n\n(defense counsel was ineffective where his strategy established an element of the offense that\n\nhad not been established in the State’s case).\n\n¶ 68                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 69   For the reasons stated, the judgment of the circuit court of Winnebago County is\n\naffirmed.\n\n¶ 70   Affirmed.\n\n\n                                                 - 21 -\n\f",

He was sentenced to a total of 70 years’ imprisonment. On\n\nappeal, the defendant argues that: (1) he was not convicted beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the\n\ntrial court erred in admitting gang-related evidence; and (3) he was deprived of the effective\n\nassistance of counsel. We affirm.\n\n¶2                                    BACKGROUND\n\n¶3     On June 23, 2010, the defendant and his brother Isaac were charged by indictment with\n\nthe first-degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) (West 2010)) of Demarkis Robinson\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nand the attempted first-degree murder (720 ILCS 5/8-4(a), 9-1(a)(1) (West 2010)) of William\n\nPatrick. The trial court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the brothers’ trials.\n\n¶4      Between September 24 and 27, 2012, the trial court conducted a jury trial. The State’s\n\nevidence established that Patrick had prior convictions of mob action and possession of a firearm\n\nwithout a firearm owner’s identification (FOID) card and that he was a member of the Insane\n\nUnknowns street gang. That gang was a rival of the Latin Kings. Robinson was his close friend\n\nand also a member of the Insane Unknowns.\n\n¶5      On May 27, 2010, Patrick and his aunt, Wanda Perez, were visiting his grandmother’s\n\nhouse at 1129 6th Avenue in Rockford. Robinson was also there. Robinson spent time on the\n\nfront porch with Patrick, Perez, and other family members. While on the porch, Perez noticed a\n\ngray Tahoe sport utility vehicle (SUV) quickly approach and then stop near the 8th Street and 6th\n\nAvenue intersection. Because its approach grabbed her attention, she told Patrick and Robinson\n\nto watch the SUV. Patrick watched it drive past the house slowly, with the driver’s side of the\n\nvehicle facing the house. Perez momentarily played with her phone, but when she looked up she\n\nnoticed the driver make a hand gesture with two fingers pointing downward. Perez did not\n\nclosely view the vehicle’s occupants. Perez believed that the gesture was a gang sign. Both\n\nRobinson and Patrick were present when the gesture was made. Patrick explained that the hand\n\ngesture was an act of disrespect to the Insane Unknowns. Then, Patrick observed the driver\n\ndisplay a gang sign for the Latin Kings. Patrick testified that the driver’s hand gestures were\n\ngrounds to start a fight.\n\n¶6      Patrick took his nieces into the house because “anything could start to happen.” The\n\nTahoe was traveling toward 7th Street, but Robinson and Patrick walked toward 9th Street.\n\nShortly after Robinson and Patrick left, Perez heard what sounded like one close gunshot. She\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nthen called Robinson’s father, Samuel, and told him that she heard a gunshot and that Robinson\n\nand Patrick were running toward his house. The call was made at 3 p.m.\n\n¶7     Patrick and Robinson passed through an alley and turned onto 5th Avenue. When they\n\nexited the alley 15 to 20 minutes after first seeing the Tahoe, Patrick, while speaking on his\n\nphone, saw the Tahoe, with the same driver, pass them very slowly. Patrick observed that the\n\npassenger had a bandana around his face, which signified to Patrick that the occupants of the\n\nTahoe were going to start shooting. Patrick picked up a brick and threw it at the Tahoe so that it\n\nwould keep moving. Geraldine Horton was walking by as this occurred. (Horton had previously\n\nbeen convicted of drug-related charges and she had other charges pending against her.) She\n\nheard glass break and saw the SUV stop a few feet before a stop sign. Lacressa Dangel was\n\ndriving by as this occurred. (Dangel had previously been convicted of prostitution, theft, and\n\ndrug-related charges. She also had traffic charges pending against her.) Dangel felt and saw\n\nsomething hit the back of her car on her northbound journey along 9th Street, between 2:45 and 3\n\np.m. She stopped her car north of 5th Avenue and saw a silver SUV facing west on 5th Avenue.\n\nShe observed the scene unfold through her rearview mirror.\n\n¶8     Horton, Patrick, and Dangel watched as: (1) the Tahoe’s passenger door opened; (2) a\n\npassenger exited and walked toward the back of the vehicle; and (3) the passenger used two\n\nhands to hold, point, and fire a firearm four or five times. Dangel believed that the gun looked\n\nlike a skinny BB gun and that the shooter was a Hispanic male. Patrick believed that the firearm\n\nlooked like a rifle, and he heard five to eight shots fired. He ducked behind a tree, and Robinson\n\nveered off into an alleyway.\n\n¶9     After the passenger stopped firing, he returned inside the waiting vehicle, and the vehicle\n\nsped off down 5th Avenue. Horton saw the driver as he passed; his eyes were wide open, and he\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\ngripped the steering wheel with locked and tensed arms. Horton later told the police that the\n\ndriver looked scared. At trial, she testified that the driver was surprised to see her. She\n\ndescribed both the driver and the passenger as Hispanic.\n\n¶ 10   In response to the phone call from Perez, Samuel ran toward the area where the shots\n\nwere fired. About 15 to 20 minutes later, Samuel found Robinson’s shirt and then saw Robinson\n\nlying naked under a faucet. Samuel picked up the clothing from the yard and brought it to his\n\nson. Samuel saw that Robinson was in and out of consciousness and he called 911. Robinson\n\nthen told Samuel, “that damn Richard shot me.” From a previous discussion with his son,\n\nSamuel had learned that Richard and Robinson had been in a fight at Rockford East High\n\nSchool, Richard was a Latin King who attended East High School, and Robinson had\n\nencountered Richard at Perez’s mother’s house a month before the shooting.\n\n¶ 11   Police officers responded to the scene and discovered five spent .22-caliber shell casings\n\nin the street. The casings were run over and deformed, but they were in a small grouping.\n\nRobinson was transported to SwedishAmerican Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\n¶ 12   On May 28, 2010, Dr. Mark Peters performed an autopsy on Robinson. Dr. Peters opined\n\nthat Robinson died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen that caused internal bleeding,\n\nhemorrhagic shock, and blood loss. Though such an injury could cause instant death, a person\n\ncould walk and live with such an injury for 30 minutes before dying. Dr. Peters recovered from\n\nRobinson’s body a bullet that appeared consistent with .22-caliber ammunition.\n\n¶ 13   On May 28, 2010, Patrick spoke to Rockford police officers about the incident and gave\n\nhis statement. He was upset, shaking, and crying. In his statement, Patrick did not mention that\n\nhe threw a brick at the silver Tahoe or that Robinson walked up to the vehicle and spoke to the\n\noccupants. Though he had not seen the driver before, Patrick knew that the driver was a Latin\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nKing, based upon the display of the Latin Kings’ gang sign. From a photo array, Patrick\n\nidentified the defendant as the driver of the Tahoe and Isaac as the shooter.\n\n¶ 14   Also on May 28, 2010, Rockford police officers interviewed Dangel. She identified Isaac\n\nas the shooter. She was not able to identify the driver of the vehicle.\n\n¶ 15   On May 29, 2010, the police arrested both the defendant and Isaac.               The police\n\ndiscovered the defendant’s Tahoe at the house where he was arrested. When the Tahoe was\n\ninspected, the police found a spent .22-caliber casing under the rear passenger seat.\n\n¶ 16   Patrick and Perez subsequently identified the defendant’s Tahoe as the one they saw on\n\nthe day of the shooting. Both Horton and Dangel told the police that the defendant’s Tahoe\n\nlooked like the one involved in the shooting.\n\n¶ 17   Illinois State Police forensic scientist David Welte compared the five spent cartridges\n\nfound on the street with the one found in the Tahoe. He concluded that all six casings were fired\n\nfrom the same .22-caliber firearm. Although he determined that the bullet recovered from\n\nRobinson was the same caliber as the six casings, he could not determine if it was fired from the\n\nsame firearm, because, as the firearm used in the shooting was never recovered, he was not able\n\nto compare it to that firearm.\n\n¶ 18   On February 7, 2011, Patrick went to the office of the defendant’s attorney, David Vella.\n\nHe was accompanied by someone who identified himself as a Vice Lord from Chicago. Patrick\n\ntold Vella that the written statement he had given to the police was false and that he had laughed\n\nwhen it was read. He told Vella that he could not identify the driver or the shooter, because\n\nhoods and masks covered their faces. At trial, Patrick testified that his statement to Vella was\n\nfalse and that he had made it because he had been threatened.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 19   In September 2012, Patrick told an assistant State’s Attorney that he did not want to\n\ntestify. Patrick explained that people had threatened him. He was concerned about his safety.\n\nPatrick indicated that he could still identify the driver of the Tahoe from a photo array, but not\n\nthe shooter. (At trial, he testified that he could identify the shooter as well.) Patrick also made\n\nno reference to Robinson talking to the occupants of the Tahoe. (At trial, he testified that\n\nRobinson and the occupants said a couple of words when the vehicle first pulled up.)\n\n¶ 20   The State introduced evidence that the defendant was a Latin King. Specifically, Gary\n\nAnderson, a Winnebago County corrections officer, said that the defendant told him that he was\n\na Latin King and that he needed to be segregated from other gangs. The State also introduced\n\ntestimony from Rockford police officer Marc Posley, an expert on street gangs. He explained\n\nthe significance of gang members’ hand gestures and their rivalries with other gangs.\n\n¶ 21   Following the denial of his motion for a directed verdict, the defendant presented two\n\nwitnesses. Rockford police officer Courtney Tillman Listhrup, a school liaison officer at East\n\nHigh School, testified that on May 14, 2010, Isaac complained to her that someone had broken\n\nthe driver’s-side and rear windows of his Chevy Suburban. Officer Jeffrey Schroder was called\n\nto impeach Patrick’s testimony.\n\n¶ 22   At the close of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree murder and\n\nattempted first-degree murder. Following the denial of his posttrial motion, the trial court\n\nsentenced the defendant to a total of 70 years’ imprisonment. The defendant thereafter filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal.\n\n¶ 23                                       ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 24   The defendant’s first contention on appeal is that he was not convicted beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Specifically, the defendant argues that the State failed to prove that he was\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\npresent at the shooting or that he possessed the requisite intent for convictions of the charged\n\noffenses.\n\n¶ 25   It is not the province of this court to retry the defendant. People v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248588\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248588/people-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 (1985). The relevant question is “ ‘whether, after viewing the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ ” (Emphasis in original.) Id. (quoting\n\nJackson v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1979)). “The sufficiency of the evidence and the relative\n\nweight and credibility to be given the testimony of the witnesses are considerations within the\n\nexclusive jurisdiction of the fact finder.” People v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (2010).\n\nThe evaluation of the testimony and the resolution of any conflicts or inconsistencies that appear\n\nare also wholly within the province of the finder of fact. Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261-62.\n\n¶ 26   The offense of first-degree murder is shown when the State proves, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that, in performing the acts that cause the death of an individual, the defendant “either\n\nintends to kill or do great bodily harm to that individual or another, or knows that such acts will\n\ncause death to that individual or another.” 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) (West 2010).\n\n¶ 27   The offense of attempted murder is shown when the State proves, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that the defendant, with the specific intent to kill, commits any act that constitutes a\n\nsubstantial step toward the commission of murder. 720 ILCS 5/8-4, 9-1 (West 2010). The\n\nquestion of a defendant’s intent is one of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact, and can be\n\ninferred from the surrounding circumstances, such as the character of the attack, the use of a\n\ndeadly weapon, and the severity of injury. People v. Valentin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2119222\"><a href=\"/opinion/2119222/people-v-valentin/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 951 (2004).\n\n¶ 28   Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we first address whether\n\nthe evidence established that the defendant was the driver of the vehicle involved in the shooting.\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nWe believe that it did. Patrick identified the defendant as the driver, one day after the murder\n\nand at trial. Patrick and Dangel identified Isaac as the passenger. Patrick and Perez identified\n\nthe defendant’s vehicle as the one involved in the shooting. Horton and Dangel indicated that\n\nthe defendant’s vehicle looked similar to the one involved in the shooting. Further, a shell casing\n\nfound in the defendant’s vehicle matched the casings recovered at the crime scene. Based on this\n\nevidence, the jury could reasonably conclude that (1) the defendant’s vehicle was at the shooting;\n\n(2) Isaac was the passenger in the vehicle; and (3) the defendant was driving the vehicle.\n\n¶ 29   In so ruling, we reject the defendant’s argument that, because Patrick gave numerous\n\naccounts as to what occurred, and because of his bias against the Latin Kings, his testimony was\n\nnot credible. We note that all of the inconsistencies in his statements as well as his bias against\n\nthe Latin Kings were brought to the jury’s attention. Further, other than the statement that he\n\nmade to Vella, which the circumstances suggest was made under duress, he consistently\n\nidentified the defendant as the driver of the vehicle. It was within the purview of the jury to\n\ndetermine that Patrick’s identification of the defendant was credible. See Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at\n\n261-62.\n\n¶ 30   We also reject the defendant’s argument that Patrick did not have a sufficient opportunity\n\nto observe who was driving the vehicle. In assessing identification testimony, a court considers\n\nthe following factors: (1) the witness’s opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime;\n\n(2) the witness’s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior description of the\n\ncriminal; (4) the witness’s level of certainty at the identification confrontation; and (5) the length\n\nof time between the crime and the identification confrontation.

Biggers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n199-200 (1972); People v.

The trier of fact determines the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nweight to be given identification testimony. People v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232\n\n(2006).\n\n¶ 31      As to the first factor, Patrick twice encountered the defendant in daylight on a “hot, nice\n\nday.” When the defendant first drove past Patrick and Robinson, the driver’s side of the vehicle\n\nfaced them and the windows were rolled down. Patrick saw the driver flash gang signs. Around\n\n2:45 p.m., as Patrick exited the alley onto 5th Avenue while speaking on his phone, he saw the\n\nTahoe, with the same driver, slowly passing again. Thus, Patrick’s testimony demonstrated that\n\nhe observed the defendant prior to the shooting without any obstruction. See People v. Masse,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (1992). Because Patrick had two chances to see the defendant in broad\n\ndaylight, the jury could reasonably conclude that Patrick had a sufficient opportunity to observe\n\nthe defendant.\n\n¶ 32      As to the second factor, the defendant argues that Patrick’s degree of attention was\n\ninsufficient to allow him to make a positive identification of the defendant. Specifically, the\n\ndefendant contends that Patrick’s cell-phone use distracted him during the shooting. We note\n\nthat, although Patrick was using his cell phone during his second encounter with the vehicle, he\n\nwas not using it during the first encounter, when he observed the vehicle from the porch. The\n\njury could conclude that Patrick was paying sufficient attention to what was occurring so as to\n\nidentify the defendant.\n\n¶ 33      As to the third factor—the accuracy of the witness’s description—there was no detailed\n\ntestimony. The record indicates only that Patrick described the events to police officers a day\n\nafter the shooting.\n\n¶ 34      As to the fourth factor—the witness’s level of certainty—we note that Patrick identified\n\nthe defendant one day after the incident and again at trial. The defendant asserts that Patrick’s\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nidentification was uncertain, because his identification statements equivocated during the two-\n\nyear span before trial. However, the only time that Patrick could not identify the defendant was\n\nwhen he gave a statement of recantation to Vella. Recantation statements are highly suspect and\n\nunreliable. People v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052501\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052501/people-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (1999). As such, the jury was free to reject\n\nPatrick’s recantation statement and find sufficient certainty from his other statements and his\n\ntrial testimony.\n\n¶ 35   Finally, as to the fifth factor—the length of time between the crime and the\n\nidentification—Patrick identified the defendant only one day after the murder occurred. This\n\nclearly supports a finding that the identification was valid.      Cf. Slim, 127 Ill. 2d at 313\n\n(determining that identification made 11 days after crime supported finding that identification\n\nwas valid).\n\n¶ 36   We next address the defendant’s argument that the State failed to prove the defendant\n\naccountable for the offenses because it failed to present any evidence that the defendant intended\n\nto aid and abet a murder and an attempted murder.\n\n¶ 37   To sustain a conviction based upon an accountability theory, the State must establish that\n\nthe defendant: (1) solicited, ordered, abetted, or agreed or attempted to aid another in the\n\nplanning or commission of the offense; (2) participated before or during the commission of the\n\noffense; and (3) had the concurrent, specific intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the\n\noffense. 720 ILCS 5/5-2(c) (West 2010); People v. Craigen, 2013 IL App (2d) 111300, ¶ 33. To\n\nprove intent, the State must present evidence that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the\n\nprincipal or that there was a common criminal design. People v. Fernandez, 2014 IL 115527, ¶\n\n13.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 10 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 38   While mere presence at the scene of a crime, alone, does not render a person accountable,\n\nit is a factor that may be considered with other circumstances when the trier of fact determines\n\naccountability. 720 ILCS 5/5-2(c) (West 2010). Other factors that may be considered are the\n\nmaintenance of a close affiliation with the companion after the commission of the crime, flight\n\nfrom the scene, and the failure to report the crime. Craigen, 2013 IL App (2d) 111300, ¶ 33.\n\nActive participation in the offense is not a requirement for guilt under a theory of accountability.\n\nPeople v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2225387\"><a href=\"/opinion/2225387/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 (1995). A jury can infer a defendant’s accountability from\n\nhis approving presence at the scene of the crime and from evidence of conduct showing a design\n\non the defendant’s part to aid in the offense. People v. Tinoco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2057182\"><a href=\"/opinion/2057182/people-v-tinoco/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823 (1989).\n\nFurther, to obtain a conviction based on accountability, the State must prove that the principal\n\nactually committed the offense. People v. Chirchirillo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 922 (2009).\n\n¶ 39   Again, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we believe that the\n\njury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of murder and\n\nattempted murder under a theory of accountability. The evidence indicates that the defendant\n\ninstigated the altercation when he disparaged the gang that Robinson and Patrick were in. Based\n\non Samuel’s testimony, the jury could find that the defendant knew that Robinson was in a rival\n\ngang and that Robinson would find his hand gestures insulting. Patrick explained that the\n\ndefendant’s actions indicated that he was looking to start a fight. Consistent with this perceived\n\ndesire to start a fight, the defendant was driving very slowly while Isaac was wearing a bandana\n\naround his face and holding a rifle. Patrick explained that Isaac’s wearing the bandana indicated\n\nthat he was about to start shooting. After Patrick threw a brick at the defendant’s vehicle, the\n\ndefendant stopped abruptly, which allowed Isaac to get out of the vehicle and shoot at both\n\nRobinson and Patrick. The defendant drove away quickly after Isaac returned to the vehicle.\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nBased on all of this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant intended to aid\n\nand abet the murder of Robinson and the attempted murder of Patrick.\n\n¶ 40   In so ruling, we note that the defendant correctly points out that flashing gang symbols\n\ndoes not by itself establish an intent to commit a crime. See People v. Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094599\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094599/people-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n485 (1991) (citing instances of flashing gang symbols that did not immediately precede violent\n\naltercations). Similarly, a defendant’s knowledge that his passenger has a gun does not establish\n\nby itself that the defendant approved of his passenger using that gun to commit a crime. See\n\nPeople v. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2117284\"><a href=\"/opinion/2117284/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448 (1999) (driver found not guilty of aggravated discharge of a\n\nfirearm even when he knew that his passenger had a gun). However, in Gonzalez and Taylor, the\n\ndefendant’s actions were much less indicative of an intent to assist with the commission of a\n\ncrime. As set forth above, considering the totality of the defendant’s conduct in this case, the\n\njury could infer that the defendant aided and abetted Isaac in committing the charged crimes.\n\n¶ 41   The defendant further argues that the State did not establish that he and Isaac were acting\n\nin concert, because it did not establish that Isaac was in a gang. The defendant contends that, as\n\nIsaac was the alleged principal in a “gang-related” shooting, Isaac’s lack of gang status was\n\nrelevant. Because there was no evidence that Isaac was a gang member, the defendant insists\n\nthat there is absolutely nothing that proves that he should have known that Isaac intended to step\n\nout of the Tahoe and shoot at two people who were not his rivals.\n\n¶ 42   Although the record does not establish that Isaac and the defendant were in the same\n\ngang, the evidence does establish that the defendant and Isaac are brothers. The jury could\n\nreasonably infer that Isaac and the defendant’s familial relationship was a basis for them to work\n\nin concert. Moreover, even absent a shared gang affiliation, there was other evidence that\n\nsuggested that the defendant was aware of and approved of Isaac’s plan to shoot at the victims.\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nAs described above, the defendant instigated the altercation by flashing provocative gang\n\nsymbols at the victims. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was slowly driving by the victims while\n\nIsaac was wearing a bandana across his face and was armed with a rifle. It would be counter to\n\nhuman experience for the jury to conclude that the defendant was not aware that Isaac was about\n\nto commit a crime. See People v. Calahan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299-300 (1995) (explaining\n\nthat it is a well-recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the perpetrator will seek to conceal his\n\nidentity). The defendant gave Isaac an opportunity to shoot at the victims when he stopped his\n\nvehicle abruptly. He then fled from the scene and did not report the crime. These circumstances\n\nsupport a finding that the defendant was accountable for Isaac’s actions.\n\n¶ 43    The defendant also emphasizes that one cannot be found guilty on a theory of\n\naccountability if the principal is not guilty. See Chirchirillo, 393 Ill. App. 3d at 922. He points\n\nout that Isaac was acquitted of the charged offenses. However, just because a different jury\n\nacquitted Isaac does not mean that the jury in the instant case could not find that he was in fact\n\nthe shooter. Cf. People v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

The defendant argues that the logical inference from this observation was that\n\nthe driver was scared at what the shooter was doing and that he did not acquiesce in the shooter’s\n\nactions. An equally plausible inference, however, was that the driver was scared or surprised at\n\nseeing someone who might be able to identify him later as having been involved in the crime.\n\nOf course, it was for the jury to determine which of these competing inferences was correct.\n\nPeople v.

The defendant insists that the trial court\n\ntherefore erred in not granting a mistrial sua sponte.\n\n¶ 46    Prior to trial, the trial court ruled that Robinson’s statement to Samuel, “that damn\n\nRichard shot me,” would be admissible as a dying declaration. At trial, on direct examination,\n\nSamuel testified that Robinson’s statement was “that damn Ricardo shot me.” Samuel then\n\ntestified to how his son was taken to a hospital and how he subsequently learned that his son had\n\ndied.   At this point, defense counsel objected, arguing that Samuel’s testimony, using the\n\ndefendant’s name, “Ricardo,” was substantially different from the statement using the name\n\n“Richard,” which the trial court had allowed as a dying declaration. The trial court responded\n\nthat defense counsel could cross-examine Samuel as to the exact name that Robinson had used.\n\nAfter the trial court’s ruling, the State asked for “the record [to] reflect that [Samuel] is clearly\n\ndistraught on the witness stand, weeping, audibly sobbing.” On cross-examination, Samuel\n\nacknowledged that the name his son had actually used was “Richard.”\n\n¶ 47    Even where defense counsel does not request a mistrial, the trial court has the discretion\n\nto grant one.

In any event, the trial court was in a better position to assess whether\n\nSamuel’s “highly emotional” testimony had an improper effect on the jury. See People v.\n\nBeltran, 2011 IL App (2d) 090856, ¶ 68 (trial court was in better position to assess whether\n\nprosecutor’s use of an “emotional voice” improperly inflamed the passions of the jury or\n\nprejudiced the defendant); see also People v.

Based on this\n\nrecord, we believe that the trial’s court handling of this issue—allowing defense counsel to bring\n\nout on cross-examination that in fact Robinson had identified “Richard,” not “Ricardo,” as his\n\nshooter—did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n\n¶ 48   The defendant’s next contention on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it allowed evidence of his past gang activity. The defendant argues that, since he had\n\nalready conceded his gang affiliation, such evidence constituted improper character evidence,\n\nwhich deprived him of a fair trial.\n\n¶ 49   In response, the State argues that this issue is forfeited because the defendant did not raise\n\nit at trial or in his posttrial motion. However, a review of the record indicates that the defendant\n\npreserved this issue by raising it both at trial and in his posttrial motion. Thus, we will consider\n\nthe merits of his contention.\n\n¶ 50   The State presented four witnesses to establish that the defendant was in the Latin Kings\n\nstreet gang. Gary Anderson testified that on June 4, 2010, the defendant approached him and\n\ninformed him that he was a Latin King and that “he needed to stay away from other gangs.”\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\n¶ 51     Westley Kemp of the Winnebago County sheriff’s department testified that he was\n\nassigned to Harlem High School as a school resource officer. On January 22, 2008, he learned\n\nthat graffiti had been discovered in one of the bathrooms. The defendant acknowledged that he\n\nhad drawn the markings.\n\n¶ 52     John Anderson testified that he worked at a juvenile detention center. On October 15,\n\n2006, he conducted a booking interview with the defendant. The defendant indicated that he was\n\na member of the Latin Kings.\n\n¶ 53     Posley testified that he had specialized training in street gangs. He was familiar with\n\ngang symbols, handshakes, hand gestures, codes, territories, and other indicia. He described the\n\nsymbols and hand gestures of the Latin Kings and the Insane Unknowns. He described those\n\ntwo gangs as rivals. Posley reviewed a picture that the defendant had drawn in the Harlem High\n\nSchool bathroom on January 22, 2008, and he testified that the markings were Latin Kings\n\ngraffiti. Based on the defendant’s drawing the graffiti as well as telling John Anderson and Gary\n\nAnderson of his gang affiliation, Posley believed that the defendant was a member of the Latin\n\nKings.\n\n¶ 54     Although jurors might have negative feelings about street gangs, it is not necessary to\n\nexclude gang-affiliation evidence if it is otherwise relevant and admissible.

The State’s theory of why the defendant and Robinson were involved in an altercation\n\nat school was that they were in rival gangs. Gary Anderson’s and John Anderson’s testimony\n\nwas therefore relevant, as both testified that the defendant had identified himself to them as a\n\nLatin King. Posley’s testimony was relevant, as it established that, not only did the defendant\n\nclaim to be a Latin King, he acted like a Latin King when he drew Latin Kings graffiti at school.\n\nPosley’s testimony that the Latin Kings and the Insane Unknowns were rival gangs was also\n\nclearly relevant. See People v. Hamilton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056702\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056702/people-v-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Opening statements are not evidence.\n\nDefense counsel’s concession did not preclude the State from presenting evidence to support its\n\ntheory of the case. See People v. Mason, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 723 (1995) (State had the right to\n\npresent evidence that the defendant was a gang member, in order to demonstrate motive).\n\n¶ 57   We also find that the defendant overstates how “excessive” the State’s gang-related\n\nevidence was. Gary Anderson and John Anderson testified to little more than that the defendant\n\nhad identified himself as a Latin King. Kemp testified that the defendant had acknowledged\n\ndrawing graffiti in the school bathroom. Posley’s testimony, although more extensive, pertained\n\nonly to the issues in the case (significance of gang hand gestures and symbols, rivalries between\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\ngangs). We do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing such evidence to\n\nestablish the defendant’s gang affiliation. Cf. id. at 720-22 (gang-related evidence found to be\n\nexcessive where State presented evidence that had no bearing on case, such as elements of gang\n\nlife and details on various Chicago gangs and their affiliations with two large national\n\norganizations).\n\n¶ 58   The defendant further asserts that evidence that he had been at a juvenile detention center\n\nwas improper in light of our supreme court’s decisions in People v. Villa, 2011 IL 110777, ¶ 41,\n\nand People v. Montgomery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120577/the-people-v-montgomery/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). In those cases, our supreme court held that\n\njuvenile adjudications are not admissible against a defendant unless they are used to impeach a\n\ntestifying defendant who has misled the jury about his criminal history or opened the door by\n\ntestifying about his prior adjudications. Villa, 2011 IL 110777, ¶¶ 46, 49; Montgomery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 516. The defendant acknowledges that the State did not actually introduce any evidence of\n\na juvenile adjudication. However, he complains that evidence of his interaction with a juvenile\n\ndetention officer was just as bad because “[c]ommon sense dictates that one is not subject to\n\ndetention as a juvenile without some process and adjudication for wrongdoing.”\n\n¶ 59   We find the defendant’s argument unpersuasive. As noted above, the State had the right\n\nto present evidence that the defendant was in a gang. See Mason, 274 Ill. App. 3d at 723. In\n\npresenting that evidence, the State also had the obligation to provide a proper foundation for it.\n\nSee People v. Nieves, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2180603\"><a href=\"/opinion/2180603/people-v-nieves/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537-38 (2000) (testimony that lacks a proper foundation as\n\nto the witness’s personal knowledge of events amounts to no evidence at all). Thus, it was not\n\nimproper for the State to solicit John Anderson’s testimony that he was working at a juvenile\n\ndetention facility when he learned from the defendant that the defendant was a Latin King.\n\nMoreover, the testimony was minimal, as Anderson did not testify to why the defendant was at\n\n\n                                              - 18 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nthe juvenile detention facility. Cf. People v. Markiewicz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2136165\"><a href=\"/opinion/2136165/people-v-markiewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

As neither Knox nor Montgomery\n\nbarred the evidence at issue, and as the evidence was limited to the defendant’s identifying\n\nhimself as a Latin King, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting that\n\nevidence. See Villarreal, 198 Ill. 2d at 232.\n\n¶ 60   That being said, we do not believe that it was necessary for the State to introduce John\n\nAnderson’s testimony, because it was duplicative of Gary Anderson’s testimony, i.e, the\n\ndefendant identified himself as a Latin King. Just because a prosecutor can introduce certain\n\nevidence does not mean that he or she should.             The prosecutor’s interest in a criminal\n\nprosecution “ ‘is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.’ ” Strickler v.

Although\n\nwe have determined that the gang-related evidence described above was not excessive to the\n\npoint of being unduly prejudicial, we believe that the evidence was close to crossing that\n\nforbidden threshold. We therefore urge the State to be more circumspect in its use of such\n\ncumulative evidence in similar cases in the future.\n\n¶ 61   The defendant’s final contention on appeal is that he was deprived of the effective\n\nassistance of counsel.    Specifically, he argues that defense counsel was ineffective for (1)\n\neliciting evidence in support of the State’s case and (2) proceeding with a strategy that, if taken\n\nto its logical conclusion, supported the State’s theory of the defendant’s guilt.\n\n¶ 62   In his opening statement, defense counsel asserted that the jury might be presented with\n\ncredible evidence that (1) Isaac was at the scene of the crime; (2) Isaac had a motive to be there;\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f2014 IL App (2d) 121368\n\n\nand (3) the defendant’s vehicle was there. However, defense counsel insisted that there would be\n\nno credible evidence that the defendant was there or that he had any motive to help Isaac.\n\n¶ 63    In questioning Samuel, defense counsel elicited testimony that Robinson had been in a\n\nfight with “Richard” at East High School and that “Richard” was a Latin King. Defense counsel\n\nelicited from Lithsrup that, at school on May 14, 2010, Isaac complained to her that someone had\n\nbroken windows on his Chevy Suburban.\n\n¶ 64    In closing arguments, defense counsel argued that “Richard really is Isaac.” He noted\n\nthat Isaac and Robinson went to the same high school. Defense counsel argued that Isaac had a\n\nmotive to shoot Robinson, because he “was getting revenge for his car windows getting broken\n\nout.”   Defense counsel then pointed to both Robinson’s dying declaration and Dangel’s\n\ntestimony that Isaac was in fact the one who had shot Robinson. Defense counsel further argued\n\nthat the defendant’s vehicle’s presence at the scene did not mean that the defendant was there.\n\nDefense counsel further insisted that the defendant had no motive to shoot Robinson and that\n\nthere was no proof that he had helped Isaac.\n\n¶ 65    In reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the standards set forth in\n\nStrickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), apply.

To succeed on such a claim, a defendant must show both that his counsel’s\n\nperformance “fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688)\n\nand that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result\n\nof the proceeding would have been different” (id. at 694).

Defense counsel was confronted with some difficult evidence: two\n\nwitnesses placed Isaac at the scene of the crime and four witnesses placed the defendant’s\n\nvehicle there. Rather than argue that all of those witnesses were mistaken, and thereby possibly\n\nundermine his own credibility, defense counsel chose to concede that evidence and instead argue\n\nthat there was no credible evidence that placed the defendant himself at the scene of the crime.\n\nAs Patrick was the State’s only witness who placed the defendant at the crime scene—and as he\n\ngave multiple conflicting accounts about what happened on the day in question―defense\n\ncounsel’s strategy that focused on attacking Patrick’s credibility was not unreasonable.\n\n¶ 67   In so ruling, we reject the defendant’s argument that defense counsel was ineffective for\n\neliciting evidence that Isaac had an independent motive to kill Robinson, i.e., revenge. Although\n\ndefense counsel, not the State, presented evidence that provided a motive for Isaac’s actions, the\n\nrecord indicates that this was part of defense counsel’s strategy to point all of the blame away\n\nfrom the defendant and toward Isaac. This evidence did not help the State prove part of its case\n\nthat it otherwise failed to prove. Cf. People v.
