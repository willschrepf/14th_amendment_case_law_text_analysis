Petitioners, thirteen neighbors of the Hine School site, and intervenor\n\nEastern   Market   Metro    Community       Association   (EMMCA)    (collectively\n\n“petitioners”) principally claim that the Commission (1) failed to appropriately\n\naddress the significant height and mass of the development, (2) did not adequately\n\nevaluate the affordable housing component of the plan, and (3) neglected to\n\nexamine the Land Disposition and Development Agreement (LDDA). We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                I.     Background\n\n\n\n      After Hine Junior High School closed in 2008, the Deputy Mayor for\n\nPlanning and Economic Development launched a competitive bid process for\n\nredeveloping the site. On July 13, 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia\n\napproved the disposition of the property to the winning bidder, Stanton-EastBanc\n\nLLC. During and after this process, the developer engaged community residents,\n\nbusiness leaders, and civic organizations, seeking input on future use of the\n\n3.16 acre site, which is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Eastern Market\n\f                                         3\n\n\nMetro Station. Stanton-EastBanc then submitted a PUD application and Zoning\n\nMap Amendment to the Zoning Commission.\n\n\n\n      The application proposed razing the school and constructing a large\n\nresidential, office, and retail development in two buildings. The North Building\n\nwould be entirely residential and contain only affordable housing, while the larger\n\nSouth Building would be mixed-use. Stanton-EastBanc also proposed creating a\n\nplaza between the two buildings and reopening a block of C Street that had been\n\neliminated in the early 1960s to make room for a playground.\n\n\n\n      In hundreds of letters and dozens of appearances during three public\n\nhearings before the Zoning Commission, community members commented on the\n\nproposal. 1 Many residents, community groups, and businesses supported the\n\nproject, including Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6B, which negotiated a\n\nMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Stanton-EastBanc. A significant number\n\nof local residents and organizations, including petitioners, opposed the project.\n\nStanton-EastBanc eventually secured approval for the PUD from the Office of\n\nPlanning (OP), the Department of Housing and Community Development\n\n      1\n         Stanton-EastBanc noted in its brief that in addition to three evenings of\ntestimony, the Zoning Commission received “493 exhibits.” The majority of these\nexhibits were letters from the community supporting or opposing the project.\n\f                                         4\n\n\n(DHCD), the Department of Transportation (DDOT), the Historic Preservation\n\nReview Board (HPRB), and the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic\n\nDevelopment (DMPED). After hearing from all of these participants, the Zoning\n\nCommission approved the PUD design and the zoning change.\n\n\n\n                       II.   The Zoning Commission’s Role\n\n\n\n      The PUD process provides developers greater design and planning flexibility\n\nthan may be possible under conventional zoning procedures.          See 11 DCMR\n\n§§ 2400.2, .4 (2013). “A P.U.D. applicant generally requests that a site be rezoned\n\nto allow more intensive development, in exchange for which the applicant offers to\n\nprovide ‘amenities’ or ‘public benefits’ which would not be provided if the site\n\nwere developed under matter-of-right zoning.” Blagden Alley Ass’n v. District of\n\nColumbia Zoning Comm’n, 590 A.2d 139, 140 n.2 (D.C. 1991) (citing 11 DCMR\n\n§ 2400.2).   When evaluating a PUD application, the Zoning Commission is\n\nrequired to “judge, balance, and reconcile the relative value of the project\n\namenities and public benefits offered, the degree of development incentives\n\nrequested, and any potential adverse effects according to the specific circumstances\n\nof the case.” 11 DCMR § 2403.8 (2013).\n\f                                            5\n\n\n      “Because of the Commission’s statutory role and subject-matter expertise,\n\nwe generally defer to the Commission’s interpretation of the zoning\n\nregulations and their relationship to the [Comprehensive] Plan.” Durant v. District\n\nof Columbia Zoning Comm’n, 65 A.3d 1161, 1166-67 (D.C. 2013) (citations\n\nomitted). “[W]e must affirm the Commission’s decision so long as (1) it has made\n\nfindings of fact on each material contested issue; (2) there is substantial evidence\n\nin the record to support each finding; and (3) its conclusions of law follow\n\nrationally from those findings.”       Id. at 1167 (citations omitted).   “Where the\n\nCommission has fully addressed the applicable aspects, policies, and material\n\nissues regarding the Plan, this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of\n\nthe Commission.” Id. at 1168 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                III.    Height and Mass\n\n\n\n      The Hine School site was zoned R-4, which designates a residential area\n\nconsisting of “row dwellings, conversions, and apartments.” 11 DCMR § 105.1\n\n(a)(4) (2013).   This designation allows a maximum height of 40 feet and a\n\f                                          6\n\n\nmaximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 1.8.2 11 DCMR §§ 400.1, 402.2, 402.4 (2013).\n\nStanton-EastBanc sought to change the zoning of the site to C-2-B, defined as a\n\n“medium-high density” commercial district. 11 DCMR § 105.1 (d)(2)(B) (2013);\n\nsee 11 DCMR §§ 720.6 to .8 (2013). This designation permits buildings in a PUD\n\nto be 90 feet in height and have a FAR of up to 6.0. 11 DCMR §§ 2405.1 to .2\n\n(2013). Stanton-EastBanc further requested that the Zoning Commission allow a\n\nsmall part of the project to rise to 94.5 feet in order to accommodate an elevator.\n\nSee 11 DCMR § 2405.3 (a) (2013) (allowing for a 5% increase in height when\n\n“essential to the successful functioning of the project”). The Commission granted\n\nthese zoning map amendments and approved the PUD despite testimony pointing\n\nto the significant difference between the height and mass of the project and the\n\npredominantly two- and three-story row houses in the historic community\n\nsurrounding it.\n\n\n\n      Petitioners argue that the Commission neither addressed concerns that “the\n\nPUD will be more than twice as tall and more than twice as dense” as the site’s\n\noriginal zoning would have allowed, nor heard sufficient evidence to make such a\n\n\n\n      2\n         “Floor area ratio—a figure that expresses the total gross floor area as a\nmultiple of the area of the lot. This figure is determined by dividing the gross floor\narea of all buildings on a lot by the area of that lot.” 11 DCMR § 199.1 (2013).\n\f                                           7\n\n\nfinding.3 This is inaccurate. In fact, acknowledging that it was one of the primary\n\nobjections to the project, the Zoning Commission addressed the height and mass of\n\nthe PUD as the first contested issue under a heading entitled “Project Design, Scale\n\n(including Height) and Density.” The Commission noted that “several persons and\n\nparties in opposition expressed objections to the project design, scale, and density.”\n\nDespite these concerns, the Commission had “no reason to disagree with the\n\nseveral decisions of HPRB . . . that the Project is compatible with the Capitol Hill\n\nHistoric District,” and found that “the visual and other potential impacts from the\n\n\n\n      3\n          Stanton-EastBanc argues that the thirteen petitioners (who were not parties\nbelow) and intervenor EMMCA lack standing to bring this claim, primarily\narguing that they have not alleged a concrete injury. We disagree. “[T]o establish\nstanding under the DCAPA to challenge an agency order, the petitioner must allege\n. . . that the interest sought to be protected . . . is arguably within the zone of\ninterests protected under the statute or constitutional guarantee in question . . . and\n. . . [there must not be a] clear legislative intent to withhold judicial review . . . .”\nDistrict of Columbia Library Renaissance Project/W. End Library Advisory Grp. v.\nDistrict of Columbia Zoning Comm’n, 73 A.3d 107, 115 (D.C. 2013) (quoting D.C.\nAppleseed Ctr. for Law & Justice, Inc. v. District of Columbia Dep’t of Ins., Sec. &\nBanking, 54 A.3d 1188, 1200 (D.C. 2012)). We hold that petitioners have asserted\na concrete injury as to all three claims. See id. at 115-16 n.4 (“For example, if a\nneighborhood organization claimed that failure to enforce compliance with the\n[Inclusionary Zoning] regulations would harm its members’ interests in a diverse\nneighborhood, that allegation would presumably bring the organization and its\nmembers directly within the zone of interests of the IZ regulations.”); Dupont\nCircle Citizens Ass’n v. Barry, 455 A.2d 417, 421-22 (D.C. 1983) (holding that\nneighborhood residents had standing to challenge new building based on its threat\nto the historic character of their neighborhood because “threats to the use and\nenjoyment of an aesthetic resource may constitute an injury in fact”).\n\f                                           8\n\n\nscale and density of the Project have been mitigated and are not unreasonable\n\ngiven . . . the character of the surrounding area.”4\n\n\n\n      Addressing the maximum height of 94.5 feet, the Commission found “that\n\nthe additional height ‘is essential to the successful functioning of the Project and\n\nconsistent with the purpose and evaluation standards of this chapter.’” Quoting\n\n11 DCMR § 2405.3 (2013). Concluding its analysis, the Commission explained\n\n“that the density and height of the PUD is appropriately dispersed on the PUD site\n\nas it appropriately relates to existing townhomes. The scaling down of the height\n\nof the Property is appropriate given its relationship to adjacent buildings and uses.”\n\n\n\n\n      4\n         Petitioners contend that we should conduct “a stricter review of the\nrecord” because much of the Commission’s order “was adopted verbatim from the\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by Stanton-EastBanc.”\nAlthough many of the developer’s proposed findings in this case were adopted\nverbatim by the Commission, substantial changes were made as well, and “we see\nno reason to doubt that the Commission’s findings and decision represent its own\nconsidered conclusions.” Watergate E. Comm. Against Hotel Conversion to Co-\nop Apartments v. District of Columbia Zoning Comm’n, 953 A.2d 1036, 1045\n(D.C. 2008) (citations omitted). “We therefore apply our normal standard,\nreviewing to ensure that the challenged findings are supported by substantial\nevidence.” Id.\n\f                                          9\n\n\n      These findings were supported by substantial evidence.5 This evidence is\n\nhighlighted by commissioners’ remarks during the hearings that “there was\n\nsubstantial support” for the project’s density and that “the density is appropriate\n\nand in the long run will be a benefit to the neighborhood and the city as a whole.”\n\nAlthough the record contains many objections to the project’s size, it is also replete\n\nwith evidence upon which the Zoning Commission based its conclusion to the\n\ncontrary. We therefore reject petitioners’ claim.\n\n\n\n                              IV.    Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n      The District of Columbia’s Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) Program requires that\n\nnew residential building projects of a certain size reserve units for affordable\n\nhousing. 14 DCMR § 2200.2 (2013). Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit\n\n(LIHTC) is available to developers who build sufficient qualifying affordable\n\nhousing. 26 U.S.C. § 42 (2013); see 10-B DCMR §§ 3402 (2013). When a project\n\nis subsidized by LIHTC, it is exempt from the IZ Program (and thus from many IZ\n\n      5\n          Among many examples, a representative from the D.C. Preservation\nLeague explained that “[t]he project’s 21st Century design is compatible with\nadjacent construction, nearby historic structure[s] and metrocentric walkable urban\nplanning.” ANC Commissioner Brian Pate, testifying in support of the project,\nsaid that some of the ANC’s initial concerns about the PUD’s height had been\nmitigated by negotiations that resulted in the removal of “the setback floor of the\nOffice Building’s top floor.”\n\f                                          10\n\n\nrequirements) if (1) it provides at least the same amount of affordable housing as\n\nthe IZ Program would have required, (2) the affordable units are reserved “for so\n\nlong as the project exists,” and (3) both obligations are stated as declarations in a\n\ncovenant approved by the District and recorded in the land records. 11 DCMR\n\n§§ 2602.3 (f), 2602.7, 2602.8 (2013).\n\n\n\n      The Hine School project, as proposed, will be exempt from the IZ Program.\n\nAs an alternative to participating in the IZ program, the developer plans to provide\n\naffordable housing through the LIHTC program, which is administered by the\n\nDistrict’s Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD).\n\nPetitioners raise three arguments concerning this proffered affordable housing.\n\n\n\n                            A. Amount of Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n          In an argument raised for the first time in their reply brief, petitioners\n\ncontend that the Commission failed to find that the PUD would provide the gross\n\nfloor area (GFA) of affordable housing that would have been required by the IZ\n\nProgram. Even if we consider this claim, 6 it fails.\n\n\n      6\n      EMMCA, as a party below, could have raised the GFA issue before the\nCommission. 11 DCMR §§ 3020.2, 3022.8 (i) (2013). When the Commission’s\n                                                            (continued…)\n\f                                        11\n\n\n\n\n      As discussed above, we will affirm the Zoning Commission’s decision if\n\n“(1) it has made findings of fact on each material contested issue; (2) there is\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support each finding; and (3) its conclusions\n\nof law follow rationally from those findings.” Durant, 65 A.3d at 1167. Under the\n\nIZ Program, the Hine School site would have been required to reserve at least\n\n8% (and perhaps 10%) of the GFA of its residential space for affordable housing.\n\n11 DCMR § 2603 (2013). Before the Zoning Commission, Stanton-EastBanc\n\nproffered that the proposed PUD would reserve 13% of its residential GFA and\n\n29% of its total units for affordable housing. Without specifically addressing the\n\nGFA of the Hine project, the Commission found that setting aside 29% of the units\n\nas affordable housing would “substantially exceed what the IZ program would\n\nhave required.”     Although it declined to describe the affordable housing\n\ncomponent as “superior,” the Commission concluded that the PUD application\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\norder became final, EMMCA had the right to file for “reconsideration, rehearing,\nor re-argument” within ten days if it believed that the Commission had failed to\naddress or had incorrectly calculated the GFA. 11 DCMR § 3029.5 (2013). It did\nneither. Moreover, “[i]t is the longstanding policy of this court not to consider\narguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.” Gathy v. United States, 754\nA.2d 913, 916 (D.C. 2000) (quoting Stockard v. Moss, 706 A.2d 561, 566 (D.C.\n1997)).\n\f                                         12\n\n\n“satisfied the requirement of § 2403.10.”7 The Commission should have made an\n\nexplicit finding about GFA, but petitioners have failed to show that its more\n\ngeneral finding, that the amount of affordable housing exceeds “what the IZ\n\nprogram would have required,” is not supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n                           B. Duration of Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n      Petitioners also claim that because the affordable housing proffered by the\n\nHine School project will “expire after a period of forty years,” it fails to meet\n\nanother one of the requirements for exemption from the IZ Program.               The\n\nCommission did not conclusively state when the affordable housing would expire,8\n\n\n      7\n         Section 11-2403.10 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations\nprovides that “[a] project may qualify for approval by being particularly strong in\nonly one or a few of the categories in § 2403.9 [listing categories of public benefits\nand project amenities], but must be acceptable in all proffered categories and\nsuperior in many.” One enumerated benefit is “the extent [to which the affordable\nhousing provided by the PUD] exceeds what would have been required through\nmatter of right development under existing zoning.” 11 DCMR § 2403.9 (f)\n(2013).\n      8\n           In its order, the Commission notes that, according to the Zoning\nAdministrator’s letter, “the development must still provide the same affordable\nhousing set-aside as would have been reserved under Inclusionary Zoning for so\nlong as the development is in existence.” (Citing 11 DCMR § 2602.7 (2013)).\nLater, it adds that “[t]he North Building units shall be affordable for a period of\n40 years . . . . The South Building units will be affordable for so long as the\nProject exists.”      Despite this apparent contradiction, the Commission’s\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\f                                          13\n\n\nhowever, nor did it find that the PUD would be exempt from the IZ Program.9 But\n\nthe Commission was not required to do either. These determinations will be made\n\nwhen the developer applies for a building permit and certificate of occupancy. See\n\n11 DCMR § 2602.7 (d) (“[t]he approved covenant [for the required quantity and\n\nduration of the affordable housing] shall be recorded . . . prior to the date that the\n\nfirst application for the certificate of occupancy is filed for the project”);\n\n12 DCMR § 110A.1.6 (2007) (“After the code official inspects the building or\n\n\n(…continued)\nexamination of the duration of the affordable housing proffered was sufficient. It\nweighed the affordable housing benefit with the understanding that the North\nBuilding’s units would remain affordable for forty years. Because the affordable\nhousing will be provided for at least that long, there is no need for the Commission\nto re-weigh the benefits of the PUD to account for a longer duration of affordable\nhousing.\n      9\n         In footnote 2 of its order, the Commission cites a determination letter from\nthe ZA which states that the PUD will become exempt from the IZ Program “upon\ncompliance with the requirements of [11 DCMR §§] 2602.7 and 2602.8.” These\nregulations require the project to provide at least the same amount of affordable\nhousing as the IZ Program would have required, to reserve those units “for so long\nas the project exists,” and to declare those obligations in a covenant approved by\nthe District and recorded in the land records. 11 DCMR § 2602.7 (2013).\nFurthermore, the developer must provide the ZA with “written certification from\nthe DHCD Director that the development meets the [first of these two]\nrequirements[.]” 11 DCMR § 2602.8 (2013). The ZA’s letter also explains that\nhis determination “is also subject to compliance . . . with the requirements of\n[11 DCMR §] 2602.3(f) at the time of the issuance of a building permit for\nconstruction[.]” As applicable here, this regulation requires Stanton-EastBanc to\ndemonstrate that the project’s affordable housing is financed, subsidized, or funded\nby the federal or District government through the LIHTC program administered by\nDHCD. See 11 DCMR § 2602.3(f) (2013).\n\f                                         14\n\n\nother structure and finds no violations of the provisions of the Construction Codes,\n\nZoning Regulations or other laws that are enforced by the Department [of\n\nConsumer and Regulatory Affairs], the code official shall issue a certificate of\n\noccupancy[.]”). Thus, it was not necessary for the Commission’s order to address\n\nwhether the Hine School project, as proffered, will be exempt from the IZ\n\nprogram.\n\n\n\n                         C. Segregation of Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n      Petitioners further argue that the affordable housing proposed for the Hine\n\nSchool site will be “segregated” in the North Building, “contraven[ing] whole\n\nsections of Chapter One of the Comprehensive Plan.” Despite this claim, the\n\nproposed PUD complies with the only section of the Comprehensive Plan\n\npetitioners cite. See 10-A DCMR § 218.3 10 (2013) (“[T]he production of new\n\naffordable housing . . . [is] essential to avoid a deepening of racial and economic\n\ndivides in the city. Affordable . . . housing production and preservation is central\n\nto the idea of growing more inclusively.”). Moreover, even though this project, as\n\nproposed, will be exempt from the IZ Program, petitioners focus on several IZ\n\nProgram regulations it claims that this PUD will violate.\n\f                                         15\n\n\n      The segregation claim was comprehensively examined by the Zoning\n\nCommission. In its initial report to the Commission, the OP raised concerns about\n\nthe concentration of affordable housing in the North Building, explaining that these\n\n“units normally should be integrated into a total mixed income project and not\n\nseparated out as they happen to be here.” To mitigate these concerns, the OP\n\nrecommended that Stanton-EastBanc “take steps to assure that the design and\n\nmaterials used on the North Building have the same level of quality and finish that\n\nthe South Building will have to make visually clear that both buildings are in the\n\nsame project and have the same level of design and construction.” During the\n\nhearings, commissioners favored a “mixed income building,” but agreed with OP\n\nthat if a separate building entirely comprised of affordable housing was necessary,\n\nit would have to appear as though it was a part of the rest of the development.\n\n\n\n      Stanton-EastBanc amended its plans to address these concerns, changing the\n\nNorth Building’s materials and design elements. In its order, the Commission\n\nnoted with approval that Stanton-EastBanc had taken their comments into\n\nconsideration and “incorporated them into a revised design.” A commissioner\n\nexplained that after these changes, the North Building “integrates better with the\n\nrest of the development,” particularly because he viewed the plaza between the\n\nbuildings as “a connecting element, not a separating element.” Furthermore, the\n\f                                          16\n\n\ndeveloper produced evidence that financiers were unwilling “to combine the\n\nfinancing of low-income housing tax credits and bonds with conventional debt and\n\nequity.” Noting “a severe crisis of affordability in this city,” one commissioner\n\naccepted the affordable housing plan because it provided a significant number of\n\naffordable units and he understood the financing concerns. Another commissioner\n\ndid not “think this is as big an issue as it might be . . . . [W]e’ve seen a number of\n\nprojects where we have an affordable component that is an independent building\n\nfor senior housing.” The record thus demonstrates that the Commission weighed\n\nthe pluses and minuses of the affordable housing component.             After careful\n\nconsideration, the Commission was “satisfied” that “the North Building will have\n\nnoteworthy amenities, will be ADA accessible and . . . [will] offer high-quality\n\narchitecture and materials, superior to those typically seen in affordable housing\n\nprojects.” We will not disturb its decision.10\n\n\n\n                                   V.     The LDDA\n\n\n\n\n      10\n           Although petitioners claim that the entire basis for the Commission’s\napproval of the “segregated” affordable housing rests upon two “informal e-mails,”\nthis is not an accurate portrayal of the record. This issue was examined at several\nof the hearings and many factors went into the Commission’s analysis.\n\f                                          17\n\n\n      In July of 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia passed a resolution\n\nauthorizing the sale and lease of different portions of the Hine School site to\n\nStanton-EastBanc. This resolution was accompanied by a term sheet and a draft\n\nLand Disposition and Development Agreement (LDDA). See D.C. Code §§ 10-\n\n801 (b-1)(2), (b-1)(5)(A)(i) (2013 Repl.) (establishing requirements for sale or\n\nlease of public land). The term sheet indicated that the ground rent of the leased\n\nportion of the site would be calculated by deducting “the cost of providing District-\n\nmandated affordable housing, environmental remediation, and any extraordinary or\n\noff-site proffer as required by the PUD to redevelop the property.” Such terms\n\nestablish requirements for the final agreement.          See D.C. Code § 10-801\n\n(b-1)(6)(A) (2012 Repl.) (“If a substantive change is made to the term sheet . . .\n\nafter the resolution was transmitted to and approved by the Council . . ., a\n\nresolution describing the change accompanied by an amended term sheet . . . in\n\nredline format shall be transmitted to Council for a 30-day period of review . . . .”).\n\nStanton-EastBanc and the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development\n\nentered into an LDDA on October 27, 2010, setting out the terms of the sale and\n\nlease of the Hine School site.\n\n\n\n      Petitioners raise two issues concerning the LDDA. First, they contend that\n\ntheir due process rights were violated because various proffers and representations\n\f                                         18\n\n\nmade by the developers referred to the LDDA or the related affordable housing\n\ncovenant. Indeed, petitioners point out, the PUD application specifically requests\n\nzoning changes “in order to accommodate the public policy objectives . . . sought\n\nby the District of Columbia through” the LDDA.               They argue that the\n\nCommission’s order therefore relied on the LDDA although that document is not\n\nin the record. Second, they claim that the Commission’s failure to examine the\n\nLDDA prevented it from discovering that the cost of many of the benefits and\n\namenities proffered by the developer was being deducted from the ground rent for\n\nthe land. Petitioners thus argue, in effect, that the amenities proffered by the\n\ndeveloper will actually be paid for by taxpayers. They ask us to remand for further\n\nproceedings in which the LDDA will be disclosed to them and examined by the\n\nCommission.11\n\n\n\n                                     A. Due Process\n\n\n\n\n      11\n          Petitioners have submitted several post-argument letters, purportedly\npursuant to D.C. App. R. 28 (k). To one they attached a copy of a ground lease\nexecuted on July 10, 2013, between the Deputy Mayor and 700 Penn LLC,\nassignee of Stanton-EastBanc’s rights and obligations under the LDDA. We have\nnot considered this lease because it is not part of the record and was executed after\nthe Commission issued its order.\n\f                                         19\n\n\n      The most notable feature of this argument is that petitioners failed to\n\ndemand production of the LDDA or the covenant when this PUD application was\n\nbefore the Commission. “In the absence of exceptional circumstances, this court\n\nwill not entertain contentions not raised before the agency.” Glenbrook Rd. Ass’n\n\nv. District of Columbia Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 605 A.2d 22, 33 (D.C. 1992)\n\n(citations omitted). Nevertheless, we “may show a measure of flexibility in this\n\nregard when the interests of justice so require.” Goodman v. District of Columbia\n\nRental Hous. Comm’n, 573 A.2d 1293, 1301 (D.C. 1990). We therefore will\n\nbriefly examine the merits of petitioners’ claim.\n\n\n\n      Although the LDDA is mentioned six times in the Commission’s order, we\n\nhave seen no evidence that the Commission examined or relied on it. Three of\n\nthese references mention the LDDA when describing the process which led to the\n\napplication. A fourth mention of the LDDA was made in response to “objections\n\nand concerns with the Applicant having used a ‘bait and switch’ tactic” by\n\nsignificantly changing the plans before submitting the PUD application.       The\n\nCommission noted that “[t]he project must be developed in accordance with the\n\nplans approved by the Commission and the conditions of approval,” and concluded\n\nthat any inconsistencies between the approved plans and “any other agreements is\n\nfor the parties to those agreements to determine and, if necessary[,] resolve.” It\n\f                                              20\n\n\nwas in this context that the Commission’s order states, “[w]hether the plans\n\napproved for the PUD are inconsistent with the terms of the LDDA is irrelevant to\n\nthe Commission’s consideration.”             Cf. Watergate E. Comm. Against Hotel\n\nConversion to Co-op Apartments v. District of Columbia Zoning Comm’n, 953\n\nA.2d 1036, 1043 n.6 (D.C. 2008) (“The Zoning Commission does not have\n\nauthority to settle a contract dispute.”).\n\n\n\n      The final two references to the LDDA in the Commission’s order simply use\n\nthe date of recording of the affordable housing covenant, “which is required by the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Government to be executed by the Applicant pursuant to the\n\nLand Disposition and Development Agreement (“LDDA”),” as the starting point of\n\na forty-year obligation. Each of these passages alludes to the existence of the\n\nLDDA, but none relies on its substance. There is nothing to suggest that the\n\nCommission ever saw the LDDA, much less that it violated due process by\n\nsubstantively relying on a document that Stanton-EastBanc hid from petitioners.\n\n\n\n      Relying on a prior opinion of this court, petitioners contend that this case\n\nmust be remanded so that they may examine the LDDA and the affordable housing\n\ncovenant for themselves. See Blagden Alley Ass’n v. District of Columbia Zoning\n\nComm’n, 590 A.2d 139, 148 (D.C. 1991). In Blagden Alley, we remanded an order\n\f                                         21\n\n\napproving a PUD “[b]ecause the Commission determined that a covenant was\n\nnecessary to ensure” that off-site affordable housing amenities would be provided,\n\nand we believed that “parties in opposition to the application . . . should be given\n\nan opportunity to examine the covenant and comment on any perceived\n\ndeficiencies.” Id.   Here, the Commission did not simply rely on Stanton-\n\nEastBanc’s promise to record a covenant. Instead, it ordered that “[n]o building\n\npermit shall be issued for the approved PUD until the Applicant has recorded a\n\ncovenant in the land records of the District of Columbia that is satisfactory to the\n\nOffice of the Attorney General and Department of Consumer and Regulatory\n\nAffairs (‘DCRA’).”     Cf. Blagden Alley, 590 A.2d at 148 n.18 (“[U]nlike the\n\ncovenant for the office building . . . , which must be ‘satisfactory to the Office of\n\nCorporation Counsel and the Zoning Regulations Division of the [DCRA],’ the\n\norder appears to give [the developer] great freedom in drafting the . . . [affordable\n\nhousing] covenant”).    Further ensuring compliance in this case, the requested\n\nzoning change does not become effective until “the recordation of the covenant.”\n\nSee 11 DCMR § 3028.9 (2013).\n\n\n\n      Perhaps more importantly, in Blagden Alley “[t]he Association made a\n\ntimely objection before the Commission, asking that any covenant be made part of\n\nthe record.” 590 A.2d at 148. No similar request was made here. “We do not\n\f                                        22\n\n\ndiscern here the kind of manifest injustice which would warrant either reversal of\n\nthe agency’s decision or a remand for further proceedings, where the request for\n\nsuch relief is predicated on a theory which the Commission has never had any\n\noccasion to address.” Goodman, 573 A.2d at 1303.12\n\n\n\n                      B. Assessment of Benefits and Amenities\n\n\n\n      Petitioners’ second claim related to the LDDA and the term sheet, that\n\namenities proffered by the developer will actually be paid for by taxpayers,\n\nlikewise is raised for the first time on appeal. 13 The Commission’s task is to\n\n\n      12\n          The information that petitioners complain has been hidden from them has\nbeen publicly available for years. The term sheet and draft LDDA with an attached\n“affordable housing covenant” were posted online by the District of Columbia as\npart of a report from the Committee on Economic Development supporting the\nCouncil’s adoption of the resolution of approval on July 13, 2010. See Council of\nthe District of Columbia Committee on Economic Development, Report on\nProposed Resolution 18-963, the “Hine Junior High School Disposition Approval\nResolution of 2010,” http://dcclims1.dccouncil.us/lims/ (search by legislation\nnumber for “PR18-963” and follow “Committee Report” hyperlink). Petitioners\ncould have secured these 2010 documents and presented them to the Commission\nat its public hearings in June and July of 2012. At a minimum, they could have\nasked the Commission to require that these documents be made a part of the\nrecord.\n      13\n           If this issue was raised before the Commission, it was only by\nimplication. Petitioners direct us to two quotes in the thousands of pages of\ntestimony and exhibits submitted to the Commission. Each quote is from\ntestimony questioning the general financial underpinnings of the project, but\n                                                                 (continued…)\n\f                                           23\n\n\n“judge, balance, and reconcile the relative value of the project amenities and public\n\nbenefits offered, the degree of development incentives requested, and any potential\n\nadverse effects according to the specific circumstances of the case.” 11 DCMR\n\n§ 2403.8 (2013). In their appellate briefs, the parties disagree about the definition\n\nof “development incentives,” but it is clear from the record that the Commission\n\nunderstood this term to refer to the flexibility the developer requested through the\n\nproposed map amendment and zoning change. Because petitioners did not ask the\n\nCommission to accept their interpretation of “development incentives,” we decline\n\nto address this issue for the first time on appeal.14\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nneither mentions the LDDA. It is therefore unsurprising that the Commission’s\nOrder does not mention the LDDA in this context. See Watergate E. Comm.\nAgainst Hotel Conversion, 953 A.2d at 1044 (“Our consideration of a claim raised\nfor the first time on appeal deprives the administrative agency of its right to\nconsider the matter, make a ruling, and state the reasons for its action . . . .”)\n(quoting Hill v. District of Columbia Dep’t of Employment Servs., 717 A.2d 909,\n912 (D.C. 1998)).\n      14\n          EMMCA did claim below that the benefits and amenities provided here\nwere not worth as much as those in previous PUD applications. Addressing this\npoint, one commissioner commented, “I don’t see a need to get into a specific\ndollar-for-dollar comparison to another project which faced its own unique\ncircumstances.” Under 11 DCMR § 2403.8, there is no requirement that the\nCommission compare the benefits offered by one PUD to those provided by\nanother.\n\f                                          24\n\n\n      We do note, however, that the petitioners in District of Columbia Library\n\nRenaissance Project/W. End Library Advisory Grp. v. District of Columbia Zoning\n\nComm’n, 73 A.3d 107 (D.C. 2013), raised a similar issue before the Commission,\n\nclaiming that the financial concessions made by the District in connection with the\n\nland transfer should be treated as either an “adverse effect” or a “development\n\nincentive.” Id. at 120, 122. Addressing that claim in an order published on\n\nApril 27, 2012, a few months before the hearings in this matter, the Commission\n\nspecifically declined to “second guess the calculations that led the District . . . to\n\nconclude this was a good deal.” Id. at 120.\n\n\n\n      There, we deferred to the Commission’s interpretation of its own\n\nregulations, noting, among other things, that the “assessment of the financial\n\nunderpinnings of the underlying land transfer does not fall within the core of the\n\nCommission’s expertise in land-use matters.” Id. at 120; see also id. at 122\n\n(holding that although the Commission is not “necessarily precluded from\n\nregulating or considering non-traditional subjects of zoning,” it is “permitted to\n\ndecline to consider the value of the land as an adverse effect”). We have no\n\f                                            25\n\n\nequivalent declination from the Commission in this case for the simple reason that\n\nit was not asked to consider the issue.15\n\n\n\n      Petitioners also claim that “[n]ot once in the entirety of its 69-page order\n\ndoes the Commission address ‘the degree of development incentives’ granted to\n\nStanton-EastBanc.’” This is incorrect. The Commission’s order cites Stanton-\n\nEastBanc’s six requests for “flexibility from the requirements of the Zoning\n\nRegulations” in a two-page section entitled “Flexibility Requested.”            In the\n\nsubsequent eleven-page section, entitled “Project Benefits and Amenities,” there is\n\na discussion of the PUD’s benefits and amenities. After these factual findings, the\n\n\n      15\n             Petitioners argue that the Commission should have and would have\nassessed the project amenities differently had it known that the District of\nColumbia was actually funding some of those amenities. See District of Columbia\nLibrary Renaissance Project, 73 A.3d at 122 (where appellants argued that because\n“the public benefits provided by the PUD are required under the terms of [the\ndeveloper’s] contract with the District of Columbia, and have already been ‘paid\nfor’ by the District of Columbia, . . . [the Commission] was ‘double-counting’ . . .\nto consider [the project amenities] as public benefits under the PUD regulations”).\nWe do not find that argument to be a basis for relief in this proceeding, given\npetitioners’ failure to bring the issue to the Commission’s attention even though\nthe critical information upon which petitioners rely appears to have been publicly\navailable. See supra note 12. Moreover, we have previously upheld the\nCommission’s decision not to consider similar arguments in the past. See District\nof Columbia Library Renaissance Project, 73 A.3d at 122-23. (“[H]av[ing]\nalready concluded that the Commission was permitted to decline to consider the\n[terms of the underlying land transfer] as an adverse effect [or a development\nincentive], . . . the question of whether the District of Columbia ‘paid twice’ for the\n[project amenities] is simply a variant of the same general idea.”).\n\f                                         26\n\n\nCommission concluded that “the project amenities and public benefits of the\n\nApplication are a reasonable tradeoff for the zoning flexibility.” This is exactly the\n\ntype of weighing that 11 DCMR § 2403.8 appears to envision.\n\n\n\n                                   VI.   Conclusion\n\n\n\n      The Order of the Zoning Commission is hereby\n\n\n\n                                              Affirmed.\n\f",

Petitioners, thirteen neighbors of the Hine School site, and intervenor\n\nEastern   Market   Metro    Community       Association   (EMMCA)    (collectively\n\n“petitioners”) principally claim that the Commission (1) failed to appropriately\n\naddress the significant height and mass of the development, (2) did not adequately\n\nevaluate the affordable housing component of the plan, and (3) neglected to\n\nexamine the Land Disposition and Development Agreement (LDDA). We affirm.\n\n\n\n                                I.     Background\n\n\n\n      After Hine Junior High School closed in 2008, the Deputy Mayor for\n\nPlanning and Economic Development launched a competitive bid process for\n\nredeveloping the site. On July 13, 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia\n\napproved the disposition of the property to the winning bidder, Stanton-EastBanc\n\nLLC. During and after this process, the developer engaged community residents,\n\nbusiness leaders, and civic organizations, seeking input on future use of the\n\n3.16 acre site, which is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Eastern Market\n\f                                         3\n\n\nMetro Station. Stanton-EastBanc then submitted a PUD application and Zoning\n\nMap Amendment to the Zoning Commission.\n\n\n\n      The application proposed razing the school and constructing a large\n\nresidential, office, and retail development in two buildings. The North Building\n\nwould be entirely residential and contain only affordable housing, while the larger\n\nSouth Building would be mixed-use. Stanton-EastBanc also proposed creating a\n\nplaza between the two buildings and reopening a block of C Street that had been\n\neliminated in the early 1960s to make room for a playground.\n\n\n\n      In hundreds of letters and dozens of appearances during three public\n\nhearings before the Zoning Commission, community members commented on the\n\nproposal. 1 Many residents, community groups, and businesses supported the\n\nproject, including Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6B, which negotiated a\n\nMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Stanton-EastBanc. A significant number\n\nof local residents and organizations, including petitioners, opposed the project.\n\nStanton-EastBanc eventually secured approval for the PUD from the Office of\n\nPlanning (OP), the Department of Housing and Community Development\n\n      1\n         Stanton-EastBanc noted in its brief that in addition to three evenings of\ntestimony, the Zoning Commission received “493 exhibits.” The majority of these\nexhibits were letters from the community supporting or opposing the project.\n\f                                         4\n\n\n(DHCD), the Department of Transportation (DDOT), the Historic Preservation\n\nReview Board (HPRB), and the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic\n\nDevelopment (DMPED). After hearing from all of these participants, the Zoning\n\nCommission approved the PUD design and the zoning change.\n\n\n\n                       II.   The Zoning Commission’s Role\n\n\n\n      The PUD process provides developers greater design and planning flexibility\n\nthan may be possible under conventional zoning procedures.          See 11 DCMR\n\n§§ 2400.2, .4 (2013). “A P.U.D. applicant generally requests that a site be rezoned\n\nto allow more intensive development, in exchange for which the applicant offers to\n\nprovide ‘amenities’ or ‘public benefits’ which would not be provided if the site\n\nwere developed under matter-of-right zoning.” Blagden Alley Ass’n v.

When evaluating a PUD application, the Zoning Commission is\n\nrequired to “judge, balance, and reconcile the relative value of the project\n\namenities and public benefits offered, the degree of development incentives\n\nrequested, and any potential adverse effects according to the specific circumstances\n\nof the case.” 11 DCMR § 2403.8 (2013).\n\f                                            5\n\n\n      “Because of the Commission’s statutory role and subject-matter expertise,\n\nwe generally defer to the Commission’s interpretation of the zoning\n\nregulations and their relationship to the [Comprehensive] Plan.” Durant v.

Height and Mass\n\n\n\n      The Hine School site was zoned R-4, which designates a residential area\n\nconsisting of “row dwellings, conversions, and apartments.” 11 DCMR § 105.1\n\n(a)(4) (2013).   This designation allows a maximum height of 40 feet and a\n\f                                          6\n\n\nmaximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 1.8.2 11 DCMR §§ 400.1, 402.2, 402.4 (2013).\n\nStanton-EastBanc sought to change the zoning of the site to C-2-B, defined as a\n\n“medium-high density” commercial district. 11 DCMR § 105.1 (d)(2)(B) (2013);\n\nsee 11 DCMR §§ 720.6 to .8 (2013). This designation permits buildings in a PUD\n\nto be 90 feet in height and have a FAR of up to 6.0. 11 DCMR §§ 2405.1 to .2\n\n(2013). Stanton-EastBanc further requested that the Zoning Commission allow a\n\nsmall part of the project to rise to 94.5 feet in order to accommodate an elevator.\n\nSee 11 DCMR § 2405.3 (a) (2013) (allowing for a 5% increase in height when\n\n“essential to the successful functioning of the project”). The Commission granted\n\nthese zoning map amendments and approved the PUD despite testimony pointing\n\nto the significant difference between the height and mass of the project and the\n\npredominantly two- and three-story row houses in the historic community\n\nsurrounding it.\n\n\n\n      Petitioners argue that the Commission neither addressed concerns that “the\n\nPUD will be more than twice as tall and more than twice as dense” as the site’s\n\noriginal zoning would have allowed, nor heard sufficient evidence to make such a\n\n\n\n      2\n         “Floor area ratio—a figure that expresses the total gross floor area as a\nmultiple of the area of the lot.

In fact, acknowledging that it was one of the primary\n\nobjections to the project, the Zoning Commission addressed the height and mass of\n\nthe PUD as the first contested issue under a heading entitled “Project Design, Scale\n\n(including Height) and Density.” The Commission noted that “several persons and\n\nparties in opposition expressed objections to the project design, scale, and density.”\n\nDespite these concerns, the Commission had “no reason to disagree with the\n\nseveral decisions of HPRB . . . that the Project is compatible with the Capitol Hill\n\nHistoric District,” and found that “the visual and other potential impacts from the\n\n\n\n      3\n          Stanton-EastBanc argues that the thirteen petitioners (who were not parties\nbelow) and intervenor EMMCA lack standing to bring this claim, primarily\narguing that they have not alleged a concrete injury. We disagree. “[T]o establish\nstanding under the DCAPA to challenge an agency order, the petitioner must allege\n. . . that the interest sought to be protected . . . is arguably within the zone of\ninterests protected under the statute or constitutional guarantee in question . . . and\n. . .

We therefore reject petitioners’ claim.\n\n\n\n                              IV.    Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n      The District of Columbia’s Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) Program requires that\n\nnew residential building projects of a certain size reserve units for affordable\n\nhousing. 14 DCMR § 2200.2 (2013). Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit\n\n(LIHTC) is available to developers who build sufficient qualifying affordable\n\nhousing. 26 U.S.C. § 42 (2013); see 10-B DCMR §§ 3402 (2013). When a project\n\nis subsidized by LIHTC, it is exempt from the IZ Program (and thus from many IZ\n\n      5\n          Among many examples, a representative from the D.C. Preservation\nLeague explained that “[t]he project’s 21st Century design is compatible with\nadjacent construction, nearby historic structure[s] and metrocentric walkable urban\nplanning.” ANC Commissioner Brian Pate, testifying in support of the project,\nsaid that some of the ANC’s initial concerns about the PUD’s height had been\nmitigated by negotiations that resulted in the removal of “the setback floor of the\nOffice Building’s top floor.”\n\f                                          10\n\n\nrequirements) if (1) it provides at least the same amount of affordable housing as\n\nthe IZ Program would have required, (2) the affordable units are reserved “for so\n\nlong as the project exists,” and (3) both obligations are stated as declarations in a\n\ncovenant approved by the District and recorded in the land records. 11 DCMR\n\n§§ 2602.3 (f), 2602.7, 2602.8 (2013).\n\n\n\n      The Hine School project, as proposed, will be exempt from the IZ Program.\n\nAs an alternative to participating in the IZ program, the developer plans to provide\n\naffordable housing through the LIHTC program, which is administered by the\n\nDistrict’s Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD).\n\nPetitioners raise three arguments concerning this proffered affordable housing.\n\n\n\n                            A. Amount of Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n          In an argument raised for the first time in their reply brief, petitioners\n\ncontend that the Commission failed to find that the PUD would provide the gross\n\nfloor area (GFA) of affordable housing that would have been required by the IZ\n\nProgram. Even if we consider this claim, 6 it fails.\n\n\n      6\n      EMMCA, as a party below, could have raised the GFA issue before the\nCommission. 11 DCMR §§ 3020.2, 3022.8 (i) (2013). When the Commission’s\n                                                            (continued…)\n\f                                        11\n\n\n\n\n      As discussed above, we will affirm the Zoning Commission’s decision if\n\n“(1) it has made findings of fact on each material contested issue; (2) there is\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support each finding; and (3) its conclusions\n\nof law follow rationally from those findings.” Durant, 65 A.3d at 1167. Under the\n\nIZ Program, the Hine School site would have been required to reserve at least\n\n8% (and perhaps 10%) of the GFA of its residential space for affordable housing.\n\n11 DCMR § 2603 (2013). Before the Zoning Commission, Stanton-EastBanc\n\nproffered that the proposed PUD would reserve 13% of its residential GFA and\n\n29% of its total units for affordable housing. Without specifically addressing the\n\nGFA of the Hine project, the Commission found that setting aside 29% of the units\n\nas affordable housing would “substantially exceed what the IZ program would\n\nhave required.”     Although it declined to describe the affordable housing\n\ncomponent as “superior,” the Commission concluded that the PUD application\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\norder became final, EMMCA had the right to file for “reconsideration, rehearing,\nor re-argument” within ten days if it believed that the Commission had failed to\naddress or had incorrectly calculated the GFA. 11 DCMR § 3029.5 (2013). It did\nneither. Moreover, “[i]t is the longstanding policy of this court not to consider\narguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.” Gathy v.

Duration of Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n      Petitioners also claim that because the affordable housing proffered by the\n\nHine School project will “expire after a period of forty years,” it fails to meet\n\nanother one of the requirements for exemption from the IZ Program.               The\n\nCommission did not conclusively state when the affordable housing would expire,8\n\n\n      7\n         Section 11-2403.10 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations\nprovides that “[a] project may qualify for approval by being particularly strong in\nonly one or a few of the categories in § 2403.9 [listing categories of public benefits\nand project amenities], but must be acceptable in all proffered categories and\nsuperior in many.” One enumerated benefit is “the extent [to which the affordable\nhousing provided by the PUD] exceeds what would have been required through\nmatter of right development under existing zoning.” 11 DCMR § 2403.9 (f)\n(2013).\n      8\n           In its order, the Commission notes that, according to the Zoning\nAdministrator’s letter, “the development must still provide the same affordable\nhousing set-aside as would have been reserved under Inclusionary Zoning for so\nlong as the development is in existence.” (Citing 11 DCMR § 2602.7 (2013)).\nLater, it adds that “[t]he North Building units shall be affordable for a period of\n40 years . . . . The South Building units will be affordable for so long as the\nProject exists.”      Despite this apparent contradiction, the Commission’s\n                                                                      (continued…)\n\f                                          13\n\n\nhowever, nor did it find that the PUD would be exempt from the IZ Program.9 But\n\nthe Commission was not required to do either. These determinations will be made\n\nwhen the developer applies for a building permit and certificate of occupancy. See\n\n11 DCMR § 2602.7 (d) (“[t]he approved covenant [for the required quantity and\n\nduration of the affordable housing] shall be recorded . . . prior to the date that the\n\nfirst application for the certificate of occupancy is filed for the project”);\n\n12 DCMR § 110A.1.6 (2007) (“After the code official inspects the building or\n\n\n(…continued)\nexamination of the duration of the affordable housing proffered was sufficient. It\nweighed the affordable housing benefit with the understanding that the North\nBuilding’s units would remain affordable for forty years. Because the affordable\nhousing will be provided for at least that long, there is no need for the Commission\nto re-weigh the benefits of the PUD to account for a longer duration of affordable\nhousing.\n      9\n         In footnote 2 of its order, the Commission cites a determination letter from\nthe ZA which states that the PUD will become exempt from the IZ Program “upon\ncompliance with the requirements of [11 DCMR §§] 2602.7 and 2602.8.” These\nregulations require the project to provide at least the same amount of affordable\nhousing as the IZ Program would have required, to reserve those units “for so long\nas the project exists,” and to declare those obligations in a covenant approved by\nthe District and recorded in the land records. 11 DCMR § 2602.7 (2013).\nFurthermore, the developer must provide the ZA with “written certification from\nthe DHCD Director that the development meets the [first of these two]\nrequirements[.]” 11 DCMR § 2602.8 (2013). The ZA’s letter also explains that\nhis determination “is also subject to compliance . . . with the requirements of\n[11 DCMR §] 2602.3(f) at the time of the issuance of a building permit for\nconstruction[.]” As applicable here, this regulation requires Stanton-EastBanc to\ndemonstrate that the project’s affordable housing is financed, subsidized, or funded\nby the federal or District government through the LIHTC program administered by\nDHCD. See 11 DCMR § 2602.3(f) (2013).\n\f                                         14\n\n\nother structure and finds no violations of the provisions of the Construction Codes,\n\nZoning Regulations or other laws that are enforced by the Department [of\n\nConsumer and Regulatory Affairs], the code official shall issue a certificate of\n\noccupancy[.]”). Thus, it was not necessary for the Commission’s order to address\n\nwhether the Hine School project, as proffered, will be exempt from the IZ\n\nprogram.\n\n\n\n                         C. Segregation of Affordable Housing\n\n\n\n      Petitioners further argue that the affordable housing proposed for the Hine\n\nSchool site will be “segregated” in the North Building, “contraven[ing] whole\n\nsections of Chapter One of the Comprehensive Plan.” Despite this claim, the\n\nproposed PUD complies with the only section of the Comprehensive Plan\n\npetitioners cite. See 10-A DCMR § 218.3 10 (2013) (“[T]he production of new\n\naffordable housing . . . [is] essential to avoid a deepening of racial and economic\n\ndivides in the city. Affordable . . . housing production and preservation is central\n\nto the idea of growing more inclusively.”). Moreover, even though this project, as\n\nproposed, will be exempt from the IZ Program, petitioners focus on several IZ\n\nProgram regulations it claims that this PUD will violate.\n\f                                         15\n\n\n      The segregation claim was comprehensively examined by the Zoning\n\nCommission. In its initial report to the Commission, the OP raised concerns about\n\nthe concentration of affordable housing in the North Building, explaining that these\n\n“units normally should be integrated into a total mixed income project and not\n\nseparated out as they happen to be here.” To mitigate these concerns, the OP\n\nrecommended that Stanton-EastBanc “take steps to assure that the design and\n\nmaterials used on the North Building have the same level of quality and finish that\n\nthe South Building will have to make visually clear that both buildings are in the\n\nsame project and have the same level of design and construction.” During the\n\nhearings, commissioners favored a “mixed income building,” but agreed with OP\n\nthat if a separate building entirely comprised of affordable housing was necessary,\n\nit would have to appear as though it was a part of the rest of the development.\n\n\n\n      Stanton-EastBanc amended its plans to address these concerns, changing the\n\nNorth Building’s materials and design elements. In its order, the Commission\n\nnoted with approval that Stanton-EastBanc had taken their comments into\n\nconsideration and “incorporated them into a revised design.” A commissioner\n\nexplained that after these changes, the North Building “integrates better with the\n\nrest of the development,” particularly because he viewed the plaza between the\n\nbuildings as “a connecting element, not a separating element.” Furthermore, the\n\f                                          16\n\n\ndeveloper produced evidence that financiers were unwilling “to combine the\n\nfinancing of low-income housing tax credits and bonds with conventional debt and\n\nequity.” Noting “a severe crisis of affordability in this city,” one commissioner\n\naccepted the affordable housing plan because it provided a significant number of\n\naffordable units and he understood the financing concerns. Another commissioner\n\ndid not “think this is as big an issue as it might be . . . . [W]e’ve seen a number of\n\nprojects where we have an affordable component that is an independent building\n\nfor senior housing.” The record thus demonstrates that the Commission weighed\n\nthe pluses and minuses of the affordable housing component.             After careful\n\nconsideration, the Commission was “satisfied” that “the North Building will have\n\nnoteworthy amenities, will be ADA accessible and . . . [will] offer high-quality\n\narchitecture and materials, superior to those typically seen in affordable housing\n\nprojects.” We will not disturb its decision.10\n\n\n\n                                   V.     The LDDA\n\n\n\n\n      10\n           Although petitioners claim that the entire basis for the Commission’s\napproval of the “segregated” affordable housing rests upon two “informal e-mails,”\nthis is not an accurate portrayal of the record. This issue was examined at several\nof the hearings and many factors went into the Commission’s analysis.\n\f                                          17\n\n\n      In July of 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia passed a resolution\n\nauthorizing the sale and lease of different portions of the Hine School site to\n\nStanton-EastBanc. This resolution was accompanied by a term sheet and a draft\n\nLand Disposition and Development Agreement (LDDA). See D.C. Code §§ 10-\n\n801 (b-1)(2), (b-1)(5)(A)(i) (2013 Repl.) (establishing requirements for sale or\n\nlease of public land). The term sheet indicated that the ground rent of the leased\n\nportion of the site would be calculated by deducting “the cost of providing District-\n\nmandated affordable housing, environmental remediation, and any extraordinary or\n\noff-site proffer as required by the PUD to redevelop the property.” Such terms\n\nestablish requirements for the final agreement.          See D.C. Code § 10-801\n\n(b-1)(6)(A) (2012 Repl.) (“If a substantive change is made to the term sheet . . .\n\nafter the resolution was transmitted to and approved by the Council . . ., a\n\nresolution describing the change accompanied by an amended term sheet . . . in\n\nredline format shall be transmitted to Council for a 30-day period of review . . . .”).\n\nStanton-EastBanc and the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development\n\nentered into an LDDA on October 27, 2010, setting out the terms of the sale and\n\nlease of the Hine School site.\n\n\n\n      Petitioners raise two issues concerning the LDDA. First, they contend that\n\ntheir due process rights were violated because various proffers and representations\n\f                                         18\n\n\nmade by the developers referred to the LDDA or the related affordable housing\n\ncovenant. Indeed, petitioners point out, the PUD application specifically requests\n\nzoning changes “in order to accommodate the public policy objectives . . . sought\n\nby the District of Columbia through” the LDDA.               They argue that the\n\nCommission’s order therefore relied on the LDDA although that document is not\n\nin the record. Second, they claim that the Commission’s failure to examine the\n\nLDDA prevented it from discovering that the cost of many of the benefits and\n\namenities proffered by the developer was being deducted from the ground rent for\n\nthe land. Petitioners thus argue, in effect, that the amenities proffered by the\n\ndeveloper will actually be paid for by taxpayers. They ask us to remand for further\n\nproceedings in which the LDDA will be disclosed to them and examined by the\n\nCommission.11\n\n\n\n                                     A. Due Process\n\n\n\n\n      11\n          Petitioners have submitted several post-argument letters, purportedly\npursuant to D.C. App. R. 28 (k). To one they attached a copy of a ground lease\nexecuted on July 10, 2013, between the Deputy Mayor and 700 Penn LLC,\nassignee of Stanton-EastBanc’s rights and obligations under the LDDA. We have\nnot considered this lease because it is not part of the record and was executed after\nthe Commission issued its order.\n\f                                         19\n\n\n      The most notable feature of this argument is that petitioners failed to\n\ndemand production of the LDDA or the covenant when this PUD application was\n\nbefore the Commission. “In the absence of exceptional circumstances, this court\n\nwill not entertain contentions not raised before the agency.” Glenbrook Rd.

Nevertheless, we “may show a measure of flexibility in this\n\nregard when the interests of justice so require.” Goodman v. District of Columbia\n\nRental Hous. Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1301 (D.C. 1990). We therefore will\n\nbriefly examine the merits of petitioners’ claim.\n\n\n\n      Although the LDDA is mentioned six times in the Commission’s order, we\n\nhave seen no evidence that the Commission examined or relied on it. Three of\n\nthese references mention the LDDA when describing the process which led to the\n\napplication. A fourth mention of the LDDA was made in response to “objections\n\nand concerns with the Applicant having used a ‘bait and switch’ tactic” by\n\nsignificantly changing the plans before submitting the PUD application.       The\n\nCommission noted that “[t]he project must be developed in accordance with the\n\nplans approved by the Commission and the conditions of approval,” and concluded\n\nthat any inconsistencies between the approved plans and “any other agreements is\n\nfor the parties to those agreements to determine and, if necessary[,] resolve.” It\n\f                                              20\n\n\nwas in this context that the Commission’s order states, “[w]hether the plans\n\napproved for the PUD are inconsistent with the terms of the LDDA is irrelevant to\n\nthe Commission’s consideration.”             Cf. Watergate E. Comm. Against Hotel\n\nConversion to Co-op Apartments v. District of Columbia Zoning Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043 n.6 (D.C. 2008) (“The Zoning Commission does not have\n\nauthority to settle a contract dispute.”).\n\n\n\n      The final two references to the LDDA in the Commission’s order simply use\n\nthe date of recording of the affordable housing covenant, “which is required by the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Government to be executed by the Applicant pursuant to the\n\nLand Disposition and Development Agreement (“LDDA”),” as the starting point of\n\na forty-year obligation. Each of these passages alludes to the existence of the\n\nLDDA, but none relies on its substance. There is nothing to suggest that the\n\nCommission ever saw the LDDA, much less that it violated due process by\n\nsubstantively relying on a document that Stanton-EastBanc hid from petitioners.\n\n\n\n      Relying on a prior opinion of this court, petitioners contend that this case\n\nmust be remanded so that they may examine the LDDA and the affordable housing\n\ncovenant for themselves. See Blagden Alley Ass’n v. District of Columbia Zoning\n\nComm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148 (D.C. 1991). In Blagden Alley, we remanded an order\n\f                                         21\n\n\napproving a PUD “[b]ecause the Commission determined that a covenant was\n\nnecessary to ensure” that off-site affordable housing amenities would be provided,\n\nand we believed that “parties in opposition to the application . . . should be given\n\nan opportunity to examine the covenant and comment on any perceived\n\ndeficiencies.” Id.   Here, the Commission did not simply rely on Stanton-\n\nEastBanc’s promise to record a covenant. Instead, it ordered that “[n]o building\n\npermit shall be issued for the approved PUD until the Applicant has recorded a\n\ncovenant in the land records of the District of Columbia that is satisfactory to the\n\nOffice of the Attorney General and Department of Consumer and Regulatory\n\nAffairs (‘DCRA’).”     Cf. Blagden Alley, 590 A.2d at 148 n.18 (“[U]nlike the\n\ncovenant for the office building . . . , which must be ‘satisfactory to the Office of\n\nCorporation Counsel and the Zoning Regulations Division of the [DCRA],’ the\n\norder appears to give [the developer] great freedom in drafting the . . . [affordable\n\nhousing] covenant”).    Further ensuring compliance in this case, the requested\n\nzoning change does not become effective until “the recordation of the covenant.”\n\nSee 11 DCMR § 3028.9 (2013).\n\n\n\n      Perhaps more importantly, in Blagden Alley “[t]he Association made a\n\ntimely objection before the Commission, asking that any covenant be made part of\n\nthe record.” 590 A.2d at 148. No similar request was made here. “We do not\n\f                                        22\n\n\ndiscern here the kind of manifest injustice which would warrant either reversal of\n\nthe agency’s decision or a remand for further proceedings, where the request for\n\nsuch relief is predicated on a theory which the Commission has never had any\n\noccasion to address.” Goodman, 573 A.2d at 1303.12\n\n\n\n                      B. Assessment of Benefits and Amenities\n\n\n\n      Petitioners’ second claim related to the LDDA and the term sheet, that\n\namenities proffered by the developer will actually be paid for by taxpayers,\n\nlikewise is raised for the first time on appeal. 13 The Commission’s task is to\n\n\n      12\n          The information that petitioners complain has been hidden from them has\nbeen publicly available for years. The term sheet and draft LDDA with an attached\n“affordable housing covenant” were posted online by the District of Columbia as\npart of a report from the Committee on Economic Development supporting the\nCouncil’s adoption of the resolution of approval on July 13, 2010. See Council of\nthe District of Columbia Committee on Economic Development, Report on\nProposed Resolution 18-963, the “Hine Junior High School Disposition Approval\nResolution of 2010,” http://dcclims1.dccouncil.us/lims/ (search by legislation\nnumber for “PR18-963” and follow “Committee Report” hyperlink). Petitioners\ncould have secured these 2010 documents and presented them to the Commission\nat its public hearings in June and July of 2012. At a minimum, they could have\nasked the Commission to require that these documents be made a part of the\nrecord.\n      13\n           If this issue was raised before the Commission, it was only by\nimplication. Petitioners direct us to two quotes in the thousands of pages of\ntestimony and exhibits submitted to the Commission. Each quote is from\ntestimony questioning the general financial underpinnings of the project, but\n                                                                 (continued…)\n\f                                           23\n\n\n“judge, balance, and reconcile the relative value of the project amenities and public\n\nbenefits offered, the degree of development incentives requested, and any potential\n\nadverse effects according to the specific circumstances of the case.” 11 DCMR\n\n§ 2403.8 (2013). In their appellate briefs, the parties disagree about the definition\n\nof “development incentives,” but it is clear from the record that the Commission\n\nunderstood this term to refer to the flexibility the developer requested through the\n\nproposed map amendment and zoning change. Because petitioners did not ask the\n\nCommission to accept their interpretation of “development incentives,” we decline\n\nto address this issue for the first time on appeal.14\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\nneither mentions the LDDA. It is therefore unsurprising that the Commission’s\nOrder does not mention the LDDA in this context. See Watergate E. Comm.\nAgainst Hotel Conversion, 953 A.2d at 1044 (“Our consideration of a claim raised\nfor the first time on appeal deprives the administrative agency of its right to\nconsider the matter, make a ruling, and state the reasons for its action . . . .”)\n(quoting Hill v. District of Columbia Dep’t of Employment Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n912 (D.C. 1998)).\n      14\n          EMMCA did claim below that the benefits and amenities provided here\nwere not worth as much as those in previous PUD applications. Addressing this\npoint, one commissioner commented, “I don’t see a need to get into a specific\ndollar-for-dollar comparison to another project which faced its own unique\ncircumstances.” Under 11 DCMR § 2403.8, there is no requirement that the\nCommission compare the benefits offered by one PUD to those provided by\nanother.\n\f                                          24\n\n\n      We do note, however, that the petitioners in District of Columbia Library\n\nRenaissance Project/W. End Library Advisory Grp. v. District of Columbia Zoning\n\nComm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. 2013), raised a similar issue before the Commission,\n\nclaiming that the financial concessions made by the District in connection with the\n\nland transfer should be treated as either an “adverse effect” or a “development\n\nincentive.” Id. at 120, 122. Addressing that claim in an order published on\n\nApril 27, 2012, a few months before the hearings in this matter, the Commission\n\nspecifically declined to “second guess the calculations that led the District . . . to\n\nconclude this was a good deal.” Id. at 120.\n\n\n\n      There, we deferred to the Commission’s interpretation of its own\n\nregulations, noting, among other things, that the “assessment of the financial\n\nunderpinnings of the underlying land transfer does not fall within the core of the\n\nCommission’s expertise in land-use matters.” Id. at 120; see also id. at 122\n\n(holding that although the Commission is not “necessarily precluded from\n\nregulating or considering non-traditional subjects of zoning,” it is “permitted to\n\ndecline to consider the value of the land as an adverse effect”). We have no\n\f                                            25\n\n\nequivalent declination from the Commission in this case for the simple reason that\n\nit was not asked to consider the issue.15\n\n\n\n      Petitioners also claim that “[n]ot once in the entirety of its 69-page order\n\ndoes the Commission address ‘the degree of development incentives’ granted to\n\nStanton-EastBanc.’” This is incorrect. The Commission’s order cites Stanton-\n\nEastBanc’s six requests for “flexibility from the requirements of the Zoning\n\nRegulations” in a two-page section entitled “Flexibility Requested.”            In the\n\nsubsequent eleven-page section, entitled “Project Benefits and Amenities,” there is\n\na discussion of the PUD’s benefits and amenities. After these factual findings, the\n\n\n      15\n             Petitioners argue that the Commission should have and would have\nassessed the project amenities differently had it known that the District of\nColumbia was actually funding some of those amenities. See District of Columbia\nLibrary Renaissance Project, 73 A.3d at 122 (where appellants argued that because\n“the public benefits provided by the PUD are required under the terms of [the\ndeveloper’s] contract with the District of Columbia, and have already been ‘paid\nfor’ by the District of Columbia, . . . [the Commission] was ‘double-counting’ . . .\nto consider [the project amenities] as public benefits under the PUD regulations”).\nWe do not find that argument to be a basis for relief in this proceeding, given\npetitioners’ failure to bring the issue to the Commission’s attention even though\nthe critical information upon which petitioners rely appears to have been publicly\navailable. See supra note 12. Moreover, we have previously upheld the\nCommission’s decision not to consider similar arguments in the past. See District\nof Columbia Library Renaissance Project, 73 A.3d at 122-23. (“[H]av[ing]\nalready concluded that the Commission was permitted to decline to consider the\n[terms of the underlying land transfer] as an adverse effect [or a development\nincentive], . . . the question of whether the District of Columbia ‘paid twice’ for the\n[project amenities] is simply a variant of the same general idea.”).\n\f                                         26\n\n\nCommission concluded that “the project amenities and public benefits of the\n\nApplication are a reasonable tradeoff for the zoning flexibility.” This is exactly the\n\ntype of weighing that 11 DCMR § 2403.8 appears to envision.\n\n\n\n                                   VI.   Conclusion\n\n\n\n      The Order of the Zoning Commission is hereby\n\n\n\n                                              Affirmed.\n\f</pre>",
