The court generally disfavors the\ncitation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited\nunder the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\f      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\n\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of\n\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n      Mr. Russell-El initiated this action by filing pro se a complaint pursuant to\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388\n\n(1971), on April 29, 1998, which he amended on May 28, 1998. He sought money\n\ndamages, naming in his complaint several named and unnamed Bureau of Prisons\n\nofficials in Florence, Colorado, and Kathleen Hawk, the Director of the United\n\nStates Bureau of Prisons. The district court dismissed Mr. Russell-El’s\n\ncomplaint, holding that the statute of limitations barred his claims. He filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal, asserting that the district court erred as to his Bivens\n\nclaim. We review de novo the district court’s determination the claims are time-\n\nbarred by the statute of limitations. See Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F.3d\n\n1191, 1194 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Pursuant to Bivens, Mr. Russell-El must allege that the defendants have\n\nviolated his rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States while they\n\nacted under color of federal law. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144,\n\n150 (1970). Construing the pro se complaint liberally, as we must, see Haines v.\n\nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972); Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fCir. 1991), Mr. Russell-El alleges that prison officials acting under color of\n\nfederal law violated his constitutional rights by subjecting him to excessive force,\n\nby displaying deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, see U.S. Const.\n\namend. VIII, and by denying him equal protection, see U.S. Const. amend. V, and\n\nthe free exercise of his religion, see U.S. Const. amend. I.\n\n      Mr. Russell-El’s claims arose from a disturbance at the Federal Correction\n\nInstitution in Florence, Colorado. The district court summarized the allegations\n\nas follows:\n\n             Mr. Russell-El alleges that on October 26, 1995, a prison riot\n      occurred on the compound while he was being held in segregation. He\n      maintains that on October 29, 1995, he was transported to another\n      prison where he was beaten by six unknown correctional officers and\n      verbally abused with racial slurs because of his alleged involvement in\n      the October 26 riot. He further maintains that an unknown doctor and\n      an unknown physician’s assistant failed or refused to treat the injuries\n      that he suffered when he was beaten.\n\n             Mr. Russell-El assert that on November 6, 1995, he received an\n      incident report charging him with attempting to riot and with inciting\n      others to riot. He further asserts that the incident report was issued\n      solely because of his race and religious beliefs. Mr. Russell-El\n      contends that the incident report later was expunged by a disciplinary\n      hearing officer who determined that the plaintiff could not have\n      participated in the riot because he was in segregation when the riot\n      occurred.\n\nRec. vol. I, doc. 30, at 2-3 (Dist. Ct. Order, filed Feb. 18, 1999) [hereinafter\n\n“Order of Dismissal”].\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f         Bivens actions, like civil rights actions asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983, are subject to the statute of limitations found in the general personal injury\n\nstatute of the state in which the action arose. See Industrial Constructors Corp. v.\n\nUnited States Bureau of Reclamation, 15 F.3d 963, 968 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\nColorado provides for a two-year statute of limitations for such actions. See\n\nColo. Rev. Stat. § 13-80-102; Blake v. Dickason, 997 F.2d 749, 750 (10th Cir.\n\n1993) (applying § 13-80-102 to § 1983 claim). Federal law determines when a\n\ncause of action accrues. “The statute of imitations begins to run when the plaintiff\n\nknows or has reason to know of the existence and cause of injury which is the\n\nbasis of his action.” Industrial Constructors Corp., 15 F.3d at 969. Here, the bulk\n\nof Mr. Russell-El’s claims accrued in late October 1995, while a few accrued in\n\nNovember and December of that year.\n\n         Mr. Russell-El signed his complaint and motion seeking leave to proceed in\n\nforma pauperis and mailed them on April 16, 1998. See Rec., doc. 3 at 6. Applying the\n\nmailbox rule, see Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 270 (1988) (holding that a pro se\n\nprisoner’s notice of appeal is filed on the date it is deposited in the prison mail system\n\nto be mailed to the court), the earliest date this action was commenced was April 16,\n\n1998. Thus, his action is time-barred unless he can demonstrate a basis for tolling the\n\nstatute. See Aldrich v. McCulloch Properties, Inc., 627 F.2d 1036, 1041 n.4 (10th Cir.\n\n1980).\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\f       Mr. Russell-El acknowledges that he filed this complaint more than two\n\nyears after the alleged violations, but contends that the statute of limitations was\n\ntolled by a prior complaint, dismissed by the court without prejudice. See\n\nRussell-El v. Correctional Officers (Unknown), Civ. No. 97-D-1087 (D. Colo.\n\nJuly 23, 1997). The first complaint raised the same claims and was filed on May\n\n7, 1997. See Order of Dismissal at 5. This case was dismissed for failure to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies and for failure to supply the court with\n\ndocumentation relating to Mr. Russell-El’s financial status. 1 ( This Circuit\n\nsubsequently held that administrative remedies need not be exhausted when a prisoner\n\nbrings a Bivens claim seeking only monetary damages. See Garrett v. Hawk, 127 F.3d\n\n1263, 1267 (10th Cir. 1997) ).\n\n       Like the matter of the statute of limitations, the issue of tolling is governed\n\nby Colorado state law. See Hardin v. Straub, 490 U.S. 536, 539 (1989); Fratus v.\n\nDeland, 49 F.3d 673, 675 (10th Cir. 1995). According to Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13-\n\n80-111(1):\n\n       [i]f an action is commenced within the period allowed by this article\n       and is terminated because of lack of jurisdiction or improper venue, the\n       plaintiff . . . may commence a new action upon the same cause of action\n\n\n       1\n        Mr. Russell-El argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his earlier\ncomplaint. Although he could have    appealed that decision directly, he did not do so.\nHe may not now attack that final judgment collaterally in this proceeding. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a); Chico-Velez v. Roche Products, Inc., 139 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 1998)\n(citing Retail Clerks Local No. 1564 v. Your Food Stores of Santa Fe, Inc., 225 F.2d\n659, 663 (10th Cir. 1955)).\n\n                                            -5-\n\f      within ninety days after the termination of the original action or within\n      the period otherwise allowed by this article, whichever is later . . . .\n\nIn applying this statute to the facts of this case, there is some question as to when\n\nthe ninety day grace period starts to run. However, under either alternative\n\nstarting date, Mr. Russell-El’s Bivens action is untimely.\n\n      In particular, if the ninety day period started to run on July 23, 1997 (the\n\ndate that the district court dismissed the prior action without prejudice), then the\n\nninety day period would end in October 1997, before two years had passed from\n\nthe accrual of Mr. Russell’s claims on October 26, 1995, October 29, 1995, and\n\nNovember 6, 1995. Under that application of Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13-80-111(1), the\n\nninety day grace period would not be triggered at all, and Mr. Russell-El’s claims\n\nwould be barred because more than two years had elapsed from the date of\n\naccrual and April 1998, the date that Mr. Russell-El filed this action.\n\n      On the other hand, even if the ninety-day grace period started to run on\n\nOctober 1, 1997 (the date that Mr. Russell-El exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies) his claims are still untimely. 2 Even though beginning the grace period\n\n      2\n        It is unclear whether Colorado is among the jurisdictions which toll\nstatutes of limitations during exhaustion of administrative remedies, if exhaustion\nis required before a suit may be filed. See, e.g., Spiegel v. School Dist. No. 1,\nLaramie County, Wyoming, 600 F.2d 264, 266-67 (10th Cir. 1979) (discussing\ntolling in Wyoming), overruled on other grounds by Garcia v. Wilson, 731 F.2d\n640 (10th Cir. 1984); Wagher v. Guy’s Foods, Inc., 885 P.2d 1197, 1205 (Kan.\n1994). We need not make such a determination, in this matter. The district court\nrequired exhaustion prior to filing suit, but Mr. Russell-El exhausted his\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                          -6-\n\fon that date would extend the permissible date for filing the action beyond the\n\noriginal two year period (i.e., beyond October and November 1997), the end of\n\nthe ninety day period under that method of calculation would still come well\n\nbefore April 1998.\n\n      Finally, Mr. Russell-El urges that the statute of limitations should be tolled\n\nfor equitable reasons because he pursued his claims diligently after 97-D-1087\n\nwas dismissed without prejudice. Pursuant to Colorado law, equitable tolling “is\n\nlimited to situations in which either the defendant has wrongfully impeded the\n\nplaintiff’s ability to bring the claim or truly extraordinary circumstances\n\nprevented the plaintiff from filing his or her claims despite diligent efforts.”\n\nDean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Hartman, 911 P.2d 1094, 1099 (Colo. 1996).\n\n      As the district court found, “Mr. Russell-El also fails to allege any\n\nextraordinary circumstances that prevented him from bringing his claims despite\n\ndiligent efforts.” Order of Dismissal at 6. After 97-D-1087 was dismissed, Mr.\n\nRussell-El exhausted his administrative remedies on October 1, 1997. On\n\nOctober 15, 1998, rather than filing a new complaint, he filed a motion for\n\ncontinuance in 97-D-1087, which was denied because that case had already been\n\ndismissed. Although we understand that a pro se plaintiff may have some\n\n      2\n          (...continued)\nadministrative remedies in less than three months. Such tolling would not bring\nthe filing of the complaint within the limitations period. Under no tolling theory\nwould the complaint be timely.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fconfusion as to the procedural aspects of the law, Mr. Russell-El provides no\n\nexplanation for having waited an additional six months before filing the instant\n\naction on April 16, 1998. Thus, we agree with the district court’s determination\n\nthat equitable tolling is not appropriate in this action, “because Mr. Russell-El’s\n\nfailure to return promptly to federal court following exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies does not demonstrate diligent efforts to pursue his claims.” Id. at 7.\n\n      In summary, the district court correctly dismissed Mr. Russell-El’s claims,\n\nwhich are barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the\n\ndistrict court’s order of dismissal.\n\n\n                                               Entered for the Court,\n\n\n\n                                               Robert H.

VIII, and by denying him equal protection, see U.S. Const. amend. V, and\n\nthe free exercise of his religion, see U.S. Const. amend. I.\n\n      Mr. Russell-El’s claims arose from a disturbance at the Federal Correction\n\nInstitution in Florence, Colorado. The district court summarized the allegations\n\nas follows:\n\n             Mr. Russell-El alleges that on October 26, 1995, a prison riot\n      occurred on the compound while he was being held in segregation. He\n      maintains that on October 29, 1995, he was transported to another\n      prison where he was beaten by six unknown correctional officers and\n      verbally abused with racial slurs because of his alleged involvement in\n      the October 26 riot. He further maintains that an unknown doctor and\n      an unknown physician’s assistant failed or refused to treat the injuries\n      that he suffered when he was beaten.\n\n             Mr. Russell-El assert that on November 6, 1995, he received an\n      incident report charging him with attempting to riot and with inciting\n      others to riot. He further asserts that the incident report was issued\n      solely because of his race and religious beliefs. Mr. Russell-El\n      contends that the incident report later was expunged by a disciplinary\n      hearing officer who determined that the plaintiff could not have\n      participated in the riot because he was in segregation when the riot\n      occurred.\n\nRec. vol.

Here, the bulk\n\nof Mr. Russell-El’s claims accrued in late October 1995, while a few accrued in\n\nNovember and December of that year.\n\n         Mr. Russell-El signed his complaint and motion seeking leave to proceed in\n\nforma pauperis and mailed them on April 16, 1998.

See\n\nRussell-El v. Correctional Officers (Unknown), Civ. No. 97-D-1087 (D. Colo.\n\nJuly 23, 1997). The first complaint raised the same claims and was filed on May\n\n7, 1997. See Order of Dismissal at 5. This case was dismissed for failure to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies and for failure to supply the court with\n\ndocumentation relating to Mr. Russell-El’s financial status. 1 ( This Circuit\n\nsubsequently held that administrative remedies need not be exhausted when a prisoner\n\nbrings a Bivens claim seeking only monetary damages. See Garrett v.

See Hardin v. Straub, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112265\"><a href=\"/opinion/112265/hardin-v-straub/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 539 (1989); Fratus v.\n\nDeland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691143\"><a href=\"/opinion/691143/david-james-fratus-v-gary-w-deland-individually-o-lane-mccotter/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 675 (10th Cir. 1995). According to Colo. Rev.

Although he could have    appealed that decision directly, he did not do so.\nHe may not now attack that final judgment collaterally in this proceeding. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a); Chico-Velez v.

However, under either alternative\n\nstarting date, Mr. Russell-El’s Bivens action is untimely.\n\n      In particular, if the ninety day period started to run on July 23, 1997 (the\n\ndate that the district court dismissed the prior action without prejudice), then the\n\nninety day period would end in October 1997, before two years had passed from\n\nthe accrual of Mr. Russell’s claims on October 26, 1995, October 29, 1995, and\n\nNovember 6, 1995. Under that application of Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13-80-111(1), the\n\nninety day grace period would not be triggered at all, and Mr. Russell-El’s claims\n\nwould be barred because more than two years had elapsed from the date of\n\naccrual and April 1998, the date that Mr. Russell-El filed this action.\n\n      On the other hand, even if the ninety-day grace period started to run on\n\nOctober 1, 1997 (the date that Mr. Russell-El exhausted his administrative\n\nremedies) his claims are still untimely. 2 Even though beginning the grace period\n\n      2\n        It is unclear whether Colorado is among the jurisdictions which toll\nstatutes of limitations during exhaustion of administrative remedies, if exhaustion\nis required before a suit may be filed. See, e.g., Spiegel v. School Dist. No. 1,\nLaramie County, Wyoming, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367014\"><a href=\"/opinion/367014/sydney-spiegel-v-school-district-no-1-laramie-county-wyoming-and-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266-67 (10th Cir. 1979) (discussing\ntolling in Wyoming), overruled on other grounds by Garcia v.

We need not make such a determination, in this matter. The district court\nrequired exhaustion prior to filing suit, but Mr. Russell-El exhausted his\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                          -6-\n\fon that date would extend the permissible date for filing the action beyond the\n\noriginal two year period (i.e., beyond October and November 1997), the end of\n\nthe ninety day period under that method of calculation would still come well\n\nbefore April 1998.\n\n      Finally, Mr. Russell-El urges that the statute of limitations should be tolled\n\nfor equitable reasons because he pursued his claims diligently after 97-D-1087\n\nwas dismissed without prejudice. Pursuant to Colorado law, equitable tolling “is\n\nlimited to situations in which either the defendant has wrongfully impeded the\n\nplaintiff’s ability to bring the claim or truly extraordinary circumstances\n\nprevented the plaintiff from filing his or her claims despite diligent efforts.”\n\nDean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Hartman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1099 (Colo. 1996).\n\n      As the district court found, “Mr. Russell-El also fails to allege any\n\nextraordinary circumstances that prevented him from bringing his claims despite\n\ndiligent efforts.” Order of Dismissal at 6. After 97-D-1087 was dismissed, Mr.\n\nRussell-El exhausted his administrative remedies on October 1, 1997. On\n\nOctober 15, 1998, rather than filing a new complaint, he filed a motion for\n\ncontinuance in 97-D-1087, which was denied because that case had already been\n\ndismissed. Although we understand that a pro se plaintiff may have some\n\n      2\n          (...continued)\nadministrative remedies in less than three months. Such tolling would not bring\nthe filing of the complaint within the limitations period. Under no tolling theory\nwould the complaint be timely.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fconfusion as to the procedural aspects of the law, Mr. Russell-El provides no\n\nexplanation for having waited an additional six months before filing the instant\n\naction on April 16, 1998. Thus, we agree with the district court’s determination\n\nthat equitable tolling is not appropriate in this action, “because Mr. Russell-El’s\n\nfailure to return promptly to federal court following exhaustion of administrative\n\nremedies does not demonstrate diligent efforts to pursue his claims.” Id. at 7.\n\n      In summary, the district court correctly dismissed Mr. Russell-El’s claims,\n\nwhich are barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the\n\ndistrict court’s order of dismissal.\n\n\n                                               Entered for the Court,\n\n\n\n                                               Robert H.
