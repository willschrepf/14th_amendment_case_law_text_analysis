The parties agreed Givan was eligible for resentencing,\nbut differed on whether Givan posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if he\nwere resentenced. The trial court agreed with the district attorney and denied the petition.\n       We reverse the order denying the petition and remand the matter to the trial court\nfor reconsideration because a critical fact on which the trial court relied is unsupported by\nthe evidence. We conclude this error constitutes an abuse of discretion resulting in a\nmiscarriage of justice.\n                          FACTS AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY\nPleadings\n       Givan’s petition alleged he was eligible for resentencing pursuant to Penal Code\nsection 1170.1261. The district attorney opposed the petition, impliedly acknowledging\nthat Givan was eligible for resentencing, but arguing that, if released, Givan would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The district attorney based his argument\non Givan’s prior convictions as well as his conduct in prison.\n       Attached to the district attorney’s opposition was the probation report for Givan’s\nthird-strike conviction, which occurred in 1995 while he was in prison for other crimes.\nThe report indicated Givan was found in possession of 25 individually wrapped bindles\nor packages of marijuana. Marijuana was also recovered from Givan’s cell, which he\nshared with another inmate. The total amount of marijuana recovered was 7.84 grams.\n       The probation report also included a summary of Givan’s criminal history, which\nbegan in 1975 with a second degree burglary conviction. (§ 459.) He was sentenced to\nthree years’ probation, including 180 days in jail. In 1977, Givan was convicted of first\ndegree burglary (ibid.) and sentenced to the California Youth Authority (now the\nDepartment of Juvenile Justice). In 1980, he was convicted of possession of a controlled\n\n       1Unless   noted otherwise, all subsequent statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n                                              2.\n\fsubstance (Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)) and placed on two years’\nmisdemeanor probation, including 90 days in jail.\n       In 1980, he was convicted of vandalism and placed on two years’ misdemeanor\nprobation. In 1981, he was convicted of two counts of robbery and sentenced to five\nyears in prison. In 1985, he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance\n(Health & Saf. Code, § 11350) and placed on two years’ felony probation. In 1987, he\nwas convicted of possession of cocaine base for sale (Health & Saf. Code, § 11351.5) and\nsentenced to five years in prison. In 1990, he was convicted of first degree burglary with\nseveral enhancements (§§ 459, 667.5, subd. (b)), including three section 667,\nsubdivision (a), prior serious-felony enhancements. He was sentenced to 23 years in\nprison. (People v. Givan (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1107.2)\n       The next relevant exhibit attached to the district attorney’s opposition was a\npreconviction probation officer’s report from Los Angeles County for the 1990\nconviction. The relevant portion of this report confirms that Givan was arrested with\nTerry Louis Lee and Derrick Jay Jackson. The report also states several arming\nenhancements were charged, including an allegation that Givan personally used a\nfirearm, but since this was a pretrial report, there is no indication the enhancements were\nfound true. The probation report purports to describe the burglary and states that the\nthree defendants entered the garage of the victim’s home when he opened the garage\n\n\n       2The  appellate opinion states Givan was sentenced to the upper term of six years\nin prison, plus one year for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, for a total of\nseven years. It appears the opinion failed to include the three section 667,\nsubdivision (a), prior serious-felony enhancements, which added five years to Givan’s\nsentence for each enhancement. The opinion also indicates that Givan’s two\ncodefendants, Derrick Jay Jackson and Terry Louis Lee, were also sentenced on arming\nenhancements. Lee was sentenced pursuant to section 12022, while Jackson was\nsentenced to an additional one year because of a “principal armed with a firearm\nenhancement .…” (People v. Givan, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at p. 1112.) The opinion does\nnot indicate that an arming or use enhancement was alleged or found true against Givan.\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fdoor. Two of the defendants were armed, and the victim allegedly identified Givan as\narmed with a shotgun. One of the perpetrators allegedly shot at the victim when he ran\ninto the house. The perpetrators followed the victim into the house and robbed him of\nmoney, jewelry, and marijuana. No one was injured, and the stolen property was\nrecovered.\n       The final group of documents included in the district attorney’s opposition to\nGivan’s petition were from the California Department of Corrections (CDC). These\ndocuments included:\n       1.     A rules-violation report from 2000 for possession of inmate-manufactured\nalcohol.\n       2.     A rules-violation report, also from 2000, that Givan failed to comply with\nCDC grooming standards. Apparently Givan’s goatee violated the rules.\n       3.     An incident cover sheet from a prison race riot in 2003, which did not result\nin a rules-violation report against Givan.\n       4.     A rules-violation report from 2007 regarding an inmate-manufactured\nweapon. The report indicates Givan’s cellmate possessed the weapon. The cellmate\ngave the weapon to Givan who attempted to dispose of the weapon while distracting the\ncorrectional officer. The report indicates the district attorney refused to prosecute the\naction because of a lack of evidence, but Givan was found guilty of a rules violation by\nCDC. The reports also noted Givan refused to submit to an unclothed body search.\n       5.     In 2008, Givan was found in violation of prison rules when he refused to\ncomply with a lawful order from CDC staff. Givan refused to accept a new cellmate.\n       6.     A document which indicated that, in 2008, Givan was charged a fee when\ntrash, rags, and string had to be removed from the plumbing for the toilet.\n       7.     In 2009, Givan was found in violation of prison rules when he submitted a\nurine sample which tested positive for THC (marijuana).\n\n\n\n                                             4.\n\f       8.     In 2009, Givan was found in violation of prison rules when he refused to\nsubmit a urine test after marijuana was found in his cell.\n       9.     A document which indicated that, on an unspecified date, Givan was\nobserved taking two pounds of chicken from the facility kitchen where he was employed.\n       Givan filed a reply to the district attorney’s opposition to his petition. Givan\nasserted he did not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, emphasizing the\nremoteness of his past crimes, the absence of any assaultive offenses while he has been\nincarcerated, the relatively few rules violations he had incurred in the last 18 years, the\npositive work reports received during his incarceration, and the purpose of the Act.\n       Attached to the opposition were various documents from Givan’s CDC file.\nIncluded were “LIFE PRISONER: PROGRESS REPORT[S]” for the period of June\n2001 through June 2006. As relevant, these reports indicate Givan was assigned to\nvarious positions throughout this period. The only behavioral issue noted for the time\nperiod was the prison riot discussed above.\n       An annual review from 2006 notes Givan had two periods of disciplinary-free\nbehavior and two periods of average or above-average work history. The 2007 annual\nreview makes the same observations. The 2010 annual review notes Givan had “2 QPs of\nno serious CDCR 115s,” and “QP of average/above average work/school performance.”\nThe 2011 annual review noted two “QPs” without serious CDCR section 115 violations,\nand with average or above-average work and/or school performance. The 2012 annual\nreview noted Givan received satisfactory work reviews during the period and did not\nhave any disciplinary history for the period.\n       Finally, the file confirms Givan earned a high school diploma in 1978 and was\ntrained as a sewing machine operator in 2012. Two work-supervisor reports rated Givan\nas satisfactory to above average in all categories for the period of April through\nSeptember 2012.\n\n\n\n                                                5.\n\f      Givan also submitted two “Laudatory/Informative Chrono[s]” from correctional\nofficers indicating he was helpful and had a good work ethic. Both concluded Givan had\n“prepared himself to become a productive member of society.” Givan’s supervisor for\nhis work position provided two “Laudatory/Informative Chrono[s]” that praised Givan\nfor his skill and knowledge and recommended him for positions in the future.\nTestimony\n      Givan testified at the hearing on his petition. He explained he lived in Michigan\nuntil his sophomore year in high school when his family moved to California. His family\nmoved into a neighborhood dominated by a subset of the Crips criminal street gang, but\nGivan denied joining the criminal street gang. He admitted he began selling marijuana,\nburglarizing homes in the area, and eventually selling crack cocaine. All of the crimes he\ncommitted were to obtain money. He was convicted of two counts of robbery in 1981\nwhen he stole two women’s purses.\n      In 1990, Givan was involved in a residential burglary that he described as a “drugs\ntransaction [that ] went bad.” Givan explained he and his partner purchased some drugs\nfrom a dealer, but the merchandise “wasn’t no good.” The two wanted to get their money\nback, so they went to the drug dealer’s house with a third man. When they arrived, the\ngarage door opened. It is unclear from Givan’s testimony whether all three perpetrators\nwere armed with firearms, or whether only two of the three were armed. Nonetheless,\nwhen the garage door opened, the perpetrators entered the residence and retrieved their\nmoney from the dealer. They also took a bag of marijuana and what appeared to be a\ncase with a disassembled gun inside. They were caught, and, with enhancements, Givan\nwas sentenced to 26 years in prison.\n      Givan testified the only illegal drug he used was marijuana. He recalled that his\nfirst rules violation occurred when he was caught with marijuana in prison. He was going\nto smoke the marijuana because it kept him calm. He was sentenced to a third-strike term\nof 25 years to life for the marijuana possession. He also admitted he was involved in a\n\n                                            6.\n\fprison riot that started when some white inmates attacked some black inmates. He was\nnot found guilty of a rules violation as a result of that incident.\n       Givan explained the rules violation regarding the weapon in 2007. He asserted his\ncellmate possessed the weapon at all times. He also explained that, while criminal\ncharges were filed, they were eventually dismissed.\n       In 2008, he received a rules violation for refusing a direct order. Givan explained\nhe refused to accept a cellmate who was much younger than he because they would not\nget along.\n       He admitted a rules violation for smoking marijuana in 2009 while incarcerated.\nApproximately two months later he received a rules violation for refusing to provide a\nurine sample. Givan refused the request because he was still smoking marijuana. A short\nwhile later, he received a rules violation for possession of marijuana. Givan testified that\nhe stopped smoking marijuana after this last incident.\n       Givan did not take self-help courses like anger management or narcotics\nanonymous because he did not feel he needed to do so. He felt he had rehabilitated\nhimself by keeping out of situations in which he could get into trouble and by choosing\nhis friends wisely.\n       If released, he planned to drive trucks for a living because those companies\ngenerally do not discriminate against people with criminal records. Givan has family and\nfriends in the business who would help him get a job. He felt he would enjoy seeing the\ncountry in this manner. He also planned to live with his mother. He claimed he had\nlearned from his 25 years in prison that he did not want to live a criminal life anymore,\nand he wanted to earn a living like everyone else.\n       On direct examination, Givan was asked how he would react in a situation where,\nas a truck driver hauling a load, the vendor refused to pay him. He responded, “I’d\nprobably be mad, but I wouldn’t react first and think second.… I wouldn’t do nothing\ncrazy .…” On cross-examination, in response to an overly convoluted hypothetical posed\n\n                                               7.\n\fby the district attorney, Givan testified that if a very smug individual refused to pay him a\nlot of money he had earned, placing Givan in the position of having no money and being\ncompletely without food or shelter the next month, Givan stated he “probably would have\nto sock him up,” claiming it was a normal reaction.3 He also testified that if released he\nwould probably attempt to obtain a medical marijuana card legally.\nTrial court ruling\n       After hearing the evidence, the trial court took the matter under submission. A\nwritten ruling was issued denying the petition. As relevant, the trial court’s ruling stated\nas follows:\n\n       “The court finds that the People have met their burden that the Petitioner\n       would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety. The court\n       notes the very dangerous facts surrounding the defendant’s priors, at least\n       one in which the defendant fired a gun at a victim. [¶] The illegal use of\n       marijuana no doubt played a part in the defendant’s violent past actions.\n       The court is concerned about the defendant returning to the use of\n       marijuana if he is released because of his past dangerous conduct when he\n       was using marijuana. In fact, the petitioner testified upon release he would\n       try to obtain a medical marijuana card. He also testified, when asked a\n       hypothetical question about what he would do if he was a victim of theft, he\n       would (referring to those that refused to pay him) ‘sock ‘em up.’”\n\n\n\n\n       3“Q.  You remember when Ms. Moceri was saying what if you drive a truck for\nsomebody, you do a good job, you deliver, the load, it’s just like it’s supposed to be on\ntime and the guy goes, yeah, sorry, whatever and just, you know, really gyps you out of\nthe money. Let me add one thing to that. It’s a lot of money. It’s next—it’s what you\nare going to live on next month. It isn’t $25. It’s next month you are going to go hungry.\nYou are not going to be able to pay the rent next month. And this guy is standing there\ngrinning at you because he got one over on you. He did. And he knew he was going to\ndo it, too. You could just tell by looking at him he was going to do it and he got it over\non you and now there you stand as my husband says, with your elbow halfway up your\narm and then what? Now what are you going to do? [¶] A. If I was being honest— [¶]\nQ. Yes, please. [¶] A.—I think I probably would have to sock him up.”\n\n\n                                             8.\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n       Section 1170.126, enacted as part of the Act, defines those eligible for\nresentencing as inmates serving an indeterminate third-strike sentence and also:\n       1.     not serving a sentence for a crime that is listed as a serious or violent felony\n(§§ 667.5, subd. (c) & 1192.7, subd. (c));\n       2.     not serving a sentence for a crime committed under the circumstances listed\nin section 667 subdivision (e)(2)(C), clauses (i) through (iii), or section 1170.12,\nsubdivision (c)(2)(C), clauses (i) through (iii); and\n       3.     who does not have a prior conviction for an offense appearing in\nsection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), clause (iv), or section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C),\nclause (iv). (§ 1170.126, subd. (e).)\n       If an inmate is eligible under the statute, then he must be resentenced “unless the\ncourt, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).)\n       This statute requires the trial court to conduct a two-step analysis. First, the trial\ncourt must determine if the inmate is eligible for resentencing. If the inmate is eligible\nfor resentencing, then the trial court must decide if resentencing the inmate would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. An inmate will be resentenced only if he\nor she is eligible, and the trial court concludes he or she does not pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215\nCal.App.4th 1279, 1299.) If the inmate is ineligible for resentencing, or the trial court\nconcludes in the exercise of its discretion the inmate would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety, then the petition is denied.\n       The trial court concluded, and the parties agree, that Givan met the eligibility\nrequirements for resentencing. If the petitioner is eligible for resentencing, “the\npetitioner shall be resentenced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of Section 667\nand paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 unless the court, in its discretion,\n\n                                              9.\n\fdetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising its discretion, “the court may\nconsider: [¶] (1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of\ncrimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments,\nand the remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record\nof rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       The dispute in this case is whether the trial court abused its discretion when it\nconcluded that resentencing Givan would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety. “‘Abuse of discretion’ has been defined as follows: ‘“The discretion intended …\nis not a capricious or arbitrary discretion, but an impartial discretion, guided and\ncontrolled in its exercise by fixed legal principles. It is not mental discretion, to be\nexercised ex gratia, but a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of\nthe law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial\njustice.”’ [Citations.]” (People v. Superior Court (Mouchaourab) (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th\n403, 413.) A trial court abuses its discretion if the factual findings critical to its decision\nare not supported by the evidence. (People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998.) It\nis an appellant’s burden to establish that the trial court abused its discretion. (Steele v.\nJensen Instrument Co. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 326, 330.)\n       Givan begins his argument by raising numerous procedural issues that have been\naddressed in prior cases, and many of which are now pending before the California\nSupreme Court. This court has addressed these issues in published cases, which the\nSupreme Court has accepted for review. Since these issues have already been addressed\nand will likely be addressed by the Supreme Court, we will simply state our conclusions\nwith citations to published cases that have not been accepted for review, if possible.\n\n\n\n                                              10.\n\f       First, in the trial court, the burden was on the prosecution to prove by a\npreponderance of the evidence that resentencing Givan posed an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety. Givan was not entitled to a jury trial. (People v. Osuna (2014)\n225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1038-1040; People v. Superior Court (Kaulick), supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305.)\n       Second, we review the trial court’s ruling under the deferential abuse of discretion\nstandard. Section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g), clearly state that when the trial\ncourt decides if a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, it is\nexercising its discretion. No reasonable interpretation of these subdivisions could arrive\nat a different conclusion.\n       Third, as this court concluded in People v. Valencia (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 514,\nthe definition of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety found in Proposition 47 and\ncodified in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), is not applicable to petitions filed pursuant to\nProposition 36 as codified in section 1170.126.4\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision—section 1170.18—by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor may\npetition for a recall and resentencing in accordance with the offense statutes as added or\n\n\n       4The Supreme Court has granted the petition for review in People v. Valencia,\nsupra, 232 Cal.App.4th 524 (review granted Feb. 18, 2015, S223825), but until the\nSupreme Court issues its interpretation of the relevant provisions, our analysis remains\nunchanged. To comply with California Rules of Court, rule 8.1115, we repeat our\nanalysis.\n\n\n                                              11.\n\famended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A person who satisfies the criteria in\nsubdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her sentence recalled and be\n“resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Id., subd. (b).)\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet—and nowhere called to voters’ attention—is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv), lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n       “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n       “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 288a,\n       sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10\n       years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n       “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of age, in\n       violation of Section 288.\n\n       “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide offense,\n       defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n       “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n       “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12.\n\f       “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n       “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in California\n       by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c), now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing a\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk that he or she will commit a new “super\nstrike” offense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.\n       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative … , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes ) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014 (Cervantes).) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the\nvoters, “their intent governs.” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n       To determine intent, “‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’”\n(Cervantes, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) We give the statute’s words “‘a plain\nand commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider the statutory\nlanguage “in isolation.” [Citation.] Rather, we look to “the entire substance of the\nstatute … in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision .… [Citation.]”\n[Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question “‘in context, keeping in mind the\nnature and obvious purpose of the statute .…’ [Citation.]” [Citation.] We must\nharmonize “the various parts of a statutory enactment … by considering the particular\nclause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.” [Citations.]’\n[Citation.]” (People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112.) We “accord[] significance, if\npossible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose. A\nconstruction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.… [S]tatutes or statutory\nsections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each\n\n\n\n                                            13.\n\fother, to the extent possible. [Citations.]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &\nHousing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387.)\n       “‘“When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nconstruction and courts should not indulge in it.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nHendrix (1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 512.) On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\nemployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47. (See People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153, 164-165; see also\nMarshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1254-1255\n(Marshall); People v. Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.) This does not mean,\nhowever, that the definition contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), must\ninexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf. Marshall, supra, at\np. 1255.) “The literal language of a statute does not prevail if it conflicts with the\nlawmakers’ intent .…” (Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1033-1034.) “‘The\napparent purpose of a statute will not be sacrificed to a literal construction.’ [Citation.]”\n(Cossack v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733.) Rather, “the literal meaning\nof a statute must be in accord with its purpose.” (People v. Mohammed (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 920, 927.) “[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a\nliteral meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the [voters] did not\nintend” (In re Michele D. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606) or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]” (Michele\nD., supra, at p. 606; accord, People v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90, 95.)\n       Thus, “‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be\nachieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\ncontemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the\n\n                                             14.\n\fstatute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘“refer to other indicia of the voters’\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We consider “the\nconsequences that will flow from a particular interpretation” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair\nEmployment & Housing Com., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1387), as well as “the wider\nhistorical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’ enactment. (Ibid.) “‘Using these\nextrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent\nintent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general\npurpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd\nconsequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Osuna, supra, at pp. 1034-1035.)\n         Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c), in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\nthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures. (See People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp.\n1, 5.)\n         As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n                 “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n         their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n         commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n         imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n         primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘ … to deter repeat offenders and,\n         at some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n         serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n         rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n\n\n                                               15.\n\f       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-824.)\n       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), were grafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\n\n\n                                             16.\n\fresult is amply demonstrated by the fact that an indeterminate life term remains\nmandatory under the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does\nnot have a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)) and that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126 for an array of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior\nconviction. (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).)\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec.,\nsupra, text of proposed law, p. 110, bolding omitted.) As we explained in Osuna, supra,\n225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law\nsomewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47—while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct”—emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.) Proposition 47\n\n                                            17.\n\frequires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property offenses,\nunless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for an offense\nrequiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). (Health &\nSaf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5, subd. (a),\n473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffenses would now be misdemeanors, but who have prior convictions for “super strike”\noffenses or for offenses requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290,\nsubdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that the initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the official title and summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47 would\n“[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses [, i.e.,\noffenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, official\ntitle and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do, the Legislative\nAnalyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders convicted of\nnonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. The measure also allows certain\noffenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for reduced\nsentences.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis.\nAnalyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the resentencing provision, the Legislative\nAnalyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes [i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen property,\n       writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply to have\n       their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In addition,\n\n                                             18.\n\f       certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a felony that\n       the measure changes could apply to the court to have their felony\n       conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who has\n       committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Voter\n       Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis.\n       Analyst, p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47 and never mentioned the Act. The “Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47” spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38.) The\n“Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47” reiterated these themes and never\nsuggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act. (See\nVoter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\nAlthough the “Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47” asserted 10,000 inmates\nwould be eligible for early release under the measure, and that many of them had prior\nconvictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and home burglary” (Voter\nInformation Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38),\nthere is no suggestion the early-release provisions would extend to inmates whose current\noffenses remained felonies under the Act. The same is true of the discussion of\nresentencing contained in the “Argument Against Proposition 47.” (Voter Information\nPamp., Gen. Elec., supra, argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\n\n\n                                            19.\n\fsection 1170.18, subdivision (c), to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position that\nProposition 47’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 jolts landscape of California\njustice system, Los Angeles Times (Nov. 5, 2014),\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141106-\nstory.html> [as of July 14, 2016].) Looking at the information conveyed to voters,\nhowever, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is of no import. (Cf.\nPeople v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v. Bradley (2012) 208\nCal.App.4th 64, 83; Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering,\nInc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 30.)\n       We are also mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed\nto be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(Cervantes, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; accord, In re Lance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d\n873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware that an “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), had been judicially\nconstrued as not being impermissibly vague, but as nevertheless having no fixed\ndefinition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763, 769-770; People v. Flores\n(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075.) Because nowhere in the ballot materials for\nProposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention that the definition of the phrase contained\nin section 1170.18, subdivision (c), would apply to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that\nrespect. Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a\n\n                                             20.\n\fproposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter information\npamphlets containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral\nexplanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in\nopposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials so\nmuch as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing under\nthe Act. (Cf. Marshall, supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [leg. history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Pub.\nContract Code].)\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize that “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that\nwhen statutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6, &\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\n\n                                            21.\n\foffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation].” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391.)\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned—and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813)—\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).\n       We now return to the primary issue in this case: Did the trial court abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded Givan posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety? As stated above, section 1170.126, subdivision (g), provides the trial courts with\nguidance in exercising their discretion. This subdivision permits, but does not require,\nthe trial courts to consider (1) the petitioner’s criminal conviction history, (2) the\npetitioner’s disciplinary and rehabilitation history while incarcerated, and (3) any other\nevidence the trial court deems relevant.\n\n\n\n                                              22.\n\f       In our summary, we reviewed at length the evidence before the trial court. Based\non this evidence, the trial court concluded Givan posed an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety because of the “very dangerous facts surrounding [Givan’s] priors, at least\none in which [Givan] fired a gun at a victim.” The trial court also observed that Givan’s\ndangerous behavior was driven by his use of marijuana, and Givan expressed at the\nhearing the desire to obtain a medical marijuana prescription. The trial court reasoned\nthat if Givan began smoking marijuana again he would return to committing dangerous\ncrimes.\n       The difficulty with the trial court’s analysis is that the facts underlying the primary\nfinding are absent support in the record. The assertion that Givan shot at the victim in the\n1990 burglary is simply not there. While the record and Givan’s testimony are confusing\nas to whether he was armed, the only reference to the firing of a weapon is found in the\npretrial probation report. The report, however, does not state Givan shot a weapon at the\nvictim, only that one of the three perpetrators shot at the victim. Moreover, since the\nmatter proceeded to a jury trial, it appears a pretrial probation report is not the most\nreliable source of factual information about the events that occurred. We also note the\nappellate opinion from that conviction does not indicate the jury found true an arming\nenhancement pertaining to Givan. The only evidence of the arming enhancement was\nfound in the CLETS report submitted by the prosecution, but the reliability of this report\nis also questionable. The CLETS report indicates Givan was convicted of “459 PC-\nBURGLARY: FIRST DEGREE-ARMED WITH FIREARM” and was sentenced to 16\nyears in prison. The sentence indicated in this report is incorrect, bringing into question\nthe reliability of the entire entry. Finally, we observe that the prosecutor conceded there\nwas no evidence Givan shot at the victim.\n\n\n\n\n                                             23.\n\f       In summary, there is no evidence that Givan shot at the victim in the 1990\nburglary, and it is unclear whether Givan was armed during the burglary.5 There is no\nevidence anyone was injured during the burglary, nor is there any evidence Givan used a\nweapon during any other crime or that any of his crimes caused an injury to a victim.6\nTherefore, the evidence does not support the trial court’s assertion that there were “very\ndangerous facts surrounding [Givan’s] priors, at least one in which [Givan] fired a gun at\na victim.”7\n       We also question the trial court’s reliance on Givan’s testimony that he would\nlegally attempt to obtain a medical marijuana prescription if released. The trial court\ninferred from this testimony that if Givan began smoking marijuana, he would return to\nhis life of crime. As this conclusion is not substantiated in the record below, upon return\nto the trial court, if this again forms the basis of the court’s finding of “unreasonable\nrisk,” further articulation will be necessary. An issue may arise if Givan didn’t have the\nfunds to obtain the prescription and the marijuana. However, Givan provided testimony\nthat he would be able to obtain a job driving a truck with his cousin, suggesting he would\nnot have to commit any crimes to obtain funds.8\n       Finally, we note that Givan testified he would strike an individual who refused to\npay wages that Givan had legally earned. While not condoning Givan’s response, we\n\n\n       5Inthe respondent’s brief, the Attorney General states that Givan denied\npossessing a gun during the robbery.\n       6We  acknowledge Givan was convicted of two robberies, but the only evidence\nabout these two incidents was provided by Givan who described them as purse snatching\ncases. He testified he did not use a weapon in these incidents.\n       7It\n         is true, however, the 1990 burglary involved the use of firearms and was thus a\ndangerous crime.\n       8Whether   a truck driver could get a medical marijuana card, or whether he could\ndrive a truck with traces of marijuana in his system, is not an issue we need to decide\nhere.\n\n\n                                             24.\n\fobserve that the hypothetical question posed by the prosecutor was not based on any facts\nand was so inflammatory that any response by Givan would have been considered to his\ndetriment. Had Givan responded he would have been okay without eating or having\nshelter the next month, the conclusion that he was lying could easily have been drawn.\nThere was no right answer to the hypothetical as posed by the prosecutor.\n       It appears the trial court placed principle reliance on its assumption that Givan\nshot at the victim of the 1990 burglary. Because there is nothing in the record to support\nthis assumption, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the petition. (People v.\nCluff, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 998 [trial court abuses discretion if factual finding\ncritical to its decision is not supported by evidence].) Nonetheless, reversal is required\nonly if the error amounted to a miscarriage of justice. (People v. Harris (2013) 57\nCal.4th 804, 842; People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 834-836.) Based on the record\nas presented, we must conclude the error amounted to just such a miscarriage.\n       After examining the entire case, we conclude it is reasonably probable that a result\nmore favorable to Givan would have been obtained in the absence of the error, thus\nrequiring reversal of the order denying the petition. (People v. Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d\nat p. 836.) The trial court placed great reliance on Givan’s asserted dangerousness,\nespecially his purportedly firing a firearm at the victim of the 1990 burglary. There was\nno other evidence that, at any time, Givan had used a weapon in the crimes he committed\nor that any victim had ever been injured. Under these circumstances, the appropriate\nremedy is to reverse the order denying the petition.\n       Our reversal of the order denying the petition is not to be read as an order to grant\nthe petition. Our holding is based on the trial court’s reliance on specific facts\nunsupported by the record. Accordingly, we are reversing the order to permit the trial\ncourt to consider all the relevant evidence in the record that is supported by substantial\nevidence and exercise its discretion based on those facts. In doing so, the trial court may\nor may not reach the same conclusion. There are certainly facts that would support either\n\n                                             25.\n\fview. The decision, however, must in the first instance be made by the trial court. In the\nevent the trial court reaches the same conclusion, further articulation regarding the nexus\nbetween marijuana use (or non-use) and “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety”\nwill be necessary.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The order denying the petition is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial\ncourt for reconsideration of Givan’s petition for resentencing in light of this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26.\n\f",

The parties agreed Givan was eligible for resentencing,\nbut differed on whether Givan posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if he\nwere resentenced. The trial court agreed with the district attorney and denied the petition.\n       We reverse the order denying the petition and remand the matter to the trial court\nfor reconsideration because a critical fact on which the trial court relied is unsupported by\nthe evidence. We conclude this error constitutes an abuse of discretion resulting in a\nmiscarriage of justice.\n                          FACTS AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY\nPleadings\n       Givan’s petition alleged he was eligible for resentencing pursuant to Penal Code\nsection 1170.1261. The district attorney opposed the petition, impliedly acknowledging\nthat Givan was eligible for resentencing, but arguing that, if released, Givan would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The district attorney based his argument\non Givan’s prior convictions as well as his conduct in prison.\n       Attached to the district attorney’s opposition was the probation report for Givan’s\nthird-strike conviction, which occurred in 1995 while he was in prison for other crimes.\nThe report indicated Givan was found in possession of 25 individually wrapped bindles\nor packages of marijuana. Marijuana was also recovered from Givan’s cell, which he\nshared with another inmate. The total amount of marijuana recovered was 7.84 grams.\n       The probation report also included a summary of Givan’s criminal history, which\nbegan in 1975 with a second degree burglary conviction. (§ 459.) He was sentenced to\nthree years’ probation, including 180 days in jail. In 1977, Givan was convicted of first\ndegree burglary (ibid.) and sentenced to the California Youth Authority (now the\nDepartment of Juvenile Justice). In 1980, he was convicted of possession of a controlled\n\n       1Unless   noted otherwise, all subsequent statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n                                              2.\n\fsubstance (Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)) and placed on two years’\nmisdemeanor probation, including 90 days in jail.\n       In 1980, he was convicted of vandalism and placed on two years’ misdemeanor\nprobation. In 1981, he was convicted of two counts of robbery and sentenced to five\nyears in prison. In 1985, he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance\n(Health & Saf. Code, § 11350) and placed on two years’ felony probation. In 1987, he\nwas convicted of possession of cocaine base for sale (Health & Saf. Code, § 11351.5) and\nsentenced to five years in prison. In 1990, he was convicted of first degree burglary with\nseveral enhancements (§§ 459, 667.5, subd. (b)), including three section 667,\nsubdivision (a), prior serious-felony enhancements. He was sentenced to 23 years in\nprison. (People v. Givan (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1107.2)\n       The next relevant exhibit attached to the district attorney’s opposition was a\npreconviction probation officer’s report from Los Angeles County for the 1990\nconviction. The relevant portion of this report confirms that Givan was arrested with\nTerry Louis Lee and Derrick Jay Jackson. The report also states several arming\nenhancements were charged, including an allegation that Givan personally used a\nfirearm, but since this was a pretrial report, there is no indication the enhancements were\nfound true. The probation report purports to describe the burglary and states that the\nthree defendants entered the garage of the victim’s home when he opened the garage\n\n\n       2The  appellate opinion states Givan was sentenced to the upper term of six years\nin prison, plus one year for the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement, for a total of\nseven years. It appears the opinion failed to include the three section 667,\nsubdivision (a), prior serious-felony enhancements, which added five years to Givan’s\nsentence for each enhancement. The opinion also indicates that Givan’s two\ncodefendants, Derrick Jay Jackson and Terry Louis Lee, were also sentenced on arming\nenhancements. Lee was sentenced pursuant to section 12022, while Jackson was\nsentenced to an additional one year because of a “principal armed with a firearm\nenhancement .…” (People v. Givan, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at p. 1112.) The opinion does\nnot indicate that an arming or use enhancement was alleged or found true against Givan.\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fdoor. Two of the defendants were armed, and the victim allegedly identified Givan as\narmed with a shotgun. One of the perpetrators allegedly shot at the victim when he ran\ninto the house. The perpetrators followed the victim into the house and robbed him of\nmoney, jewelry, and marijuana. No one was injured, and the stolen property was\nrecovered.\n       The final group of documents included in the district attorney’s opposition to\nGivan’s petition were from the California Department of Corrections (CDC). These\ndocuments included:\n       1.     A rules-violation report from 2000 for possession of inmate-manufactured\nalcohol.\n       2.     A rules-violation report, also from 2000, that Givan failed to comply with\nCDC grooming standards. Apparently Givan’s goatee violated the rules.\n       3.     An incident cover sheet from a prison race riot in 2003, which did not result\nin a rules-violation report against Givan.\n       4.     A rules-violation report from 2007 regarding an inmate-manufactured\nweapon. The report indicates Givan’s cellmate possessed the weapon. The cellmate\ngave the weapon to Givan who attempted to dispose of the weapon while distracting the\ncorrectional officer. The report indicates the district attorney refused to prosecute the\naction because of a lack of evidence, but Givan was found guilty of a rules violation by\nCDC. The reports also noted Givan refused to submit to an unclothed body search.\n       5.     In 2008, Givan was found in violation of prison rules when he refused to\ncomply with a lawful order from CDC staff. Givan refused to accept a new cellmate.\n       6.     A document which indicated that, in 2008, Givan was charged a fee when\ntrash, rags, and string had to be removed from the plumbing for the toilet.\n       7.     In 2009, Givan was found in violation of prison rules when he submitted a\nurine sample which tested positive for THC (marijuana).\n\n\n\n                                             4.\n\f       8.     In 2009, Givan was found in violation of prison rules when he refused to\nsubmit a urine test after marijuana was found in his cell.\n       9.     A document which indicated that, on an unspecified date, Givan was\nobserved taking two pounds of chicken from the facility kitchen where he was employed.\n       Givan filed a reply to the district attorney’s opposition to his petition. Givan\nasserted he did not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, emphasizing the\nremoteness of his past crimes, the absence of any assaultive offenses while he has been\nincarcerated, the relatively few rules violations he had incurred in the last 18 years, the\npositive work reports received during his incarceration, and the purpose of the Act.\n       Attached to the opposition were various documents from Givan’s CDC file.\nIncluded were “LIFE PRISONER: PROGRESS REPORT[S]” for the period of June\n2001 through June 2006. As relevant, these reports indicate Givan was assigned to\nvarious positions throughout this period. The only behavioral issue noted for the time\nperiod was the prison riot discussed above.\n       An annual review from 2006 notes Givan had two periods of disciplinary-free\nbehavior and two periods of average or above-average work history. The 2007 annual\nreview makes the same observations. The 2010 annual review notes Givan had “2 QPs of\nno serious CDCR 115s,” and “QP of average/above average work/school performance.”\nThe 2011 annual review noted two “QPs” without serious CDCR section 115 violations,\nand with average or above-average work and/or school performance. The 2012 annual\nreview noted Givan received satisfactory work reviews during the period and did not\nhave any disciplinary history for the period.\n       Finally, the file confirms Givan earned a high school diploma in 1978 and was\ntrained as a sewing machine operator in 2012. Two work-supervisor reports rated Givan\nas satisfactory to above average in all categories for the period of April through\nSeptember 2012.\n\n\n\n                                                5.\n\f      Givan also submitted two “Laudatory/Informative Chrono[s]” from correctional\nofficers indicating he was helpful and had a good work ethic. Both concluded Givan had\n“prepared himself to become a productive member of society.” Givan’s supervisor for\nhis work position provided two “Laudatory/Informative Chrono[s]” that praised Givan\nfor his skill and knowledge and recommended him for positions in the future.\nTestimony\n      Givan testified at the hearing on his petition. He explained he lived in Michigan\nuntil his sophomore year in high school when his family moved to California. His family\nmoved into a neighborhood dominated by a subset of the Crips criminal street gang, but\nGivan denied joining the criminal street gang. He admitted he began selling marijuana,\nburglarizing homes in the area, and eventually selling crack cocaine. All of the crimes he\ncommitted were to obtain money. He was convicted of two counts of robbery in 1981\nwhen he stole two women’s purses.\n      In 1990, Givan was involved in a residential burglary that he described as a “drugs\ntransaction [that ] went bad.” Givan explained he and his partner purchased some drugs\nfrom a dealer, but the merchandise “wasn’t no good.” The two wanted to get their money\nback, so they went to the drug dealer’s house with a third man. When they arrived, the\ngarage door opened. It is unclear from Givan’s testimony whether all three perpetrators\nwere armed with firearms, or whether only two of the three were armed. Nonetheless,\nwhen the garage door opened, the perpetrators entered the residence and retrieved their\nmoney from the dealer. They also took a bag of marijuana and what appeared to be a\ncase with a disassembled gun inside. They were caught, and, with enhancements, Givan\nwas sentenced to 26 years in prison.\n      Givan testified the only illegal drug he used was marijuana. He recalled that his\nfirst rules violation occurred when he was caught with marijuana in prison. He was going\nto smoke the marijuana because it kept him calm. He was sentenced to a third-strike term\nof 25 years to life for the marijuana possession. He also admitted he was involved in a\n\n                                            6.\n\fprison riot that started when some white inmates attacked some black inmates. He was\nnot found guilty of a rules violation as a result of that incident.\n       Givan explained the rules violation regarding the weapon in 2007. He asserted his\ncellmate possessed the weapon at all times. He also explained that, while criminal\ncharges were filed, they were eventually dismissed.\n       In 2008, he received a rules violation for refusing a direct order. Givan explained\nhe refused to accept a cellmate who was much younger than he because they would not\nget along.\n       He admitted a rules violation for smoking marijuana in 2009 while incarcerated.\nApproximately two months later he received a rules violation for refusing to provide a\nurine sample. Givan refused the request because he was still smoking marijuana. A short\nwhile later, he received a rules violation for possession of marijuana. Givan testified that\nhe stopped smoking marijuana after this last incident.\n       Givan did not take self-help courses like anger management or narcotics\nanonymous because he did not feel he needed to do so. He felt he had rehabilitated\nhimself by keeping out of situations in which he could get into trouble and by choosing\nhis friends wisely.\n       If released, he planned to drive trucks for a living because those companies\ngenerally do not discriminate against people with criminal records. Givan has family and\nfriends in the business who would help him get a job. He felt he would enjoy seeing the\ncountry in this manner. He also planned to live with his mother. He claimed he had\nlearned from his 25 years in prison that he did not want to live a criminal life anymore,\nand he wanted to earn a living like everyone else.\n       On direct examination, Givan was asked how he would react in a situation where,\nas a truck driver hauling a load, the vendor refused to pay him. He responded, “I’d\nprobably be mad, but I wouldn’t react first and think second.… I wouldn’t do nothing\ncrazy .…” On cross-examination, in response to an overly convoluted hypothetical posed\n\n                                               7.\n\fby the district attorney, Givan testified that if a very smug individual refused to pay him a\nlot of money he had earned, placing Givan in the position of having no money and being\ncompletely without food or shelter the next month, Givan stated he “probably would have\nto sock him up,” claiming it was a normal reaction.3 He also testified that if released he\nwould probably attempt to obtain a medical marijuana card legally.\nTrial court ruling\n       After hearing the evidence, the trial court took the matter under submission. A\nwritten ruling was issued denying the petition. As relevant, the trial court’s ruling stated\nas follows:\n\n       “The court finds that the People have met their burden that the Petitioner\n       would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety. The court\n       notes the very dangerous facts surrounding the defendant’s priors, at least\n       one in which the defendant fired a gun at a victim. [¶] The illegal use of\n       marijuana no doubt played a part in the defendant’s violent past actions.\n       The court is concerned about the defendant returning to the use of\n       marijuana if he is released because of his past dangerous conduct when he\n       was using marijuana. In fact, the petitioner testified upon release he would\n       try to obtain a medical marijuana card. He also testified, when asked a\n       hypothetical question about what he would do if he was a victim of theft, he\n       would (referring to those that refused to pay him) ‘sock ‘em up.’”\n\n\n\n\n       3“Q.  You remember when Ms. Moceri was saying what if you drive a truck for\nsomebody, you do a good job, you deliver, the load, it’s just like it’s supposed to be on\ntime and the guy goes, yeah, sorry, whatever and just, you know, really gyps you out of\nthe money. Let me add one thing to that. It’s a lot of money. It’s next—it’s what you\nare going to live on next month. It isn’t $25. It’s next month you are going to go hungry.\nYou are not going to be able to pay the rent next month. And this guy is standing there\ngrinning at you because he got one over on you. He did. And he knew he was going to\ndo it, too. You could just tell by looking at him he was going to do it and he got it over\non you and now there you stand as my husband says, with your elbow halfway up your\narm and then what? Now what are you going to do? [¶] A. If I was being honest— [¶]\nQ. Yes, please. [¶] A.—I think I probably would have to sock him up.”\n\n\n                                             8.\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n       Section 1170.126, enacted as part of the Act, defines those eligible for\nresentencing as inmates serving an indeterminate third-strike sentence and also:\n       1.     not serving a sentence for a crime that is listed as a serious or violent felony\n(§§ 667.5, subd.

(f).)\n       This statute requires the trial court to conduct a two-step analysis. First, the trial\ncourt must determine if the inmate is eligible for resentencing. If the inmate is eligible\nfor resentencing, then the trial court must decide if resentencing the inmate would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. An inmate will be resentenced only if he\nor she is eligible, and the trial court concludes he or she does not pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

If the inmate is ineligible for resentencing, or the trial court\nconcludes in the exercise of its discretion the inmate would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety, then the petition is denied.\n       The trial court concluded, and the parties agree, that Givan met the eligibility\nrequirements for resentencing. If the petitioner is eligible for resentencing, “the\npetitioner shall be resentenced pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) of Section 667\nand paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 unless the court, in its discretion,\n\n                                              9.\n\fdetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising its discretion, “the court may\nconsider: [¶] (1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of\ncrimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments,\nand the remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record\nof rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       The dispute in this case is whether the trial court abused its discretion when it\nconcluded that resentencing Givan would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety. “‘Abuse of discretion’ has been defined as follows: ‘“The discretion intended …\nis not a capricious or arbitrary discretion, but an impartial discretion, guided and\ncontrolled in its exercise by fixed legal principles. It is not mental discretion, to be\nexercised ex gratia, but a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of\nthe law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial\njustice.”’ [Citations.]” (People v.

Section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g), clearly state that when the trial\ncourt decides if a petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, it is\nexercising its discretion. No reasonable interpretation of these subdivisions could arrive\nat a different conclusion.\n       Third, as this court concluded in People v.

A person who satisfies the criteria in\nsubdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her sentence recalled and be\n“resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Id., subd. (b).)\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet—and nowhere called to voters’ attention—is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv), lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n       “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n       “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 288a,\n       sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10\n       years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n       “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of age, in\n       violation of Section 288.\n\n       “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide offense,\n       defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n       “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n       “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12.\n\f       “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n       “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in California\n       by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c), now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing a\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk that he or she will commit a new “super\nstrike” offense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.\n       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative … , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction.

(See People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp.\n1, 5.)\n         As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n                 “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n         their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n         commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n         imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n         primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘ … to deter repeat offenders and,\n         at some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n         serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n         rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n\n\n                                               15.\n\f       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), were grafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\n\n\n                                             16.\n\fresult is amply demonstrated by the fact that an indeterminate life term remains\nmandatory under the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does\nnot have a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)) and that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126 for an array of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior\nconviction. (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).)\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec.,\nsupra, text of proposed law, p. 110, bolding omitted.) As we explained in Osuna, supra,\n225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law\nsomewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47—while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct”—emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.) Proposition 47\n\n                                            17.\n\frequires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property offenses,\nunless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for an offense\nrequiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). (Health &\nSaf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5, subd. (a),\n473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffenses would now be misdemeanors, but who have prior convictions for “super strike”\noffenses or for offenses requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290,\nsubdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that the initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the official title and summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47 would\n“[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses [, i.e.,\noffenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, official\ntitle and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do, the Legislative\nAnalyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders convicted of\nnonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. The measure also allows certain\noffenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for reduced\nsentences.” (Voter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis.\nAnalyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the resentencing provision, the Legislative\nAnalyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes [i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen property,\n       writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply to have\n       their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In addition,\n\n                                             18.\n\f       certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a felony that\n       the measure changes could apply to the court to have their felony\n       conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who has\n       committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Voter\n       Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis.\n       Analyst, p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47 and never mentioned the Act. The “Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47” spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38.) The\n“Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47” reiterated these themes and never\nsuggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act. (See\nVoter Information Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\nAlthough the “Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47” asserted 10,000 inmates\nwould be eligible for early release under the measure, and that many of them had prior\nconvictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and home burglary” (Voter\nInformation Pamp., Gen. Elec., supra, rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38),\nthere is no suggestion the early-release provisions would extend to inmates whose current\noffenses remained felonies under the Act. The same is true of the discussion of\nresentencing contained in the “Argument Against Proposition 47.” (Voter Information\nPamp., Gen. Elec., supra, argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\n\n\n                                            19.\n\fsection 1170.18, subdivision (c), to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position that\nProposition 47’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 jolts landscape of California\njustice system, Los Angeles Times (Nov. 5, 2014),\n<http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141106-\nstory.html> [as of July 14, 2016].) Looking at the information conveyed to voters,\nhowever, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is of no import. (Cf.\nPeople v.

Thus, we presume voters were aware that an “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), had been judicially\nconstrued as not being impermissibly vague, but as nevertheless having no fixed\ndefinition. (People v. Garcia (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Because nowhere in the ballot materials for\nProposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention that the definition of the phrase contained\nin section 1170.18, subdivision (c), would apply to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that\nrespect. Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a\n\n                                             20.\n\fproposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter information\npamphlets containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral\nexplanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in\nopposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials so\nmuch as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing under\nthe Act. (Cf. Marshall, supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [leg. history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Pub.\nContract Code].)\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize that “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that\nwhen statutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v.

We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\n\n                                            21.\n\foffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381592/stone-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation].” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391.)\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned—and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600573\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600573/bernard-v-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813)—\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).\n       We now return to the primary issue in this case: Did the trial court abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded Givan posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety? As stated above, section 1170.126, subdivision (g), provides the trial courts with\nguidance in exercising their discretion. This subdivision permits, but does not require,\nthe trial courts to consider (1) the petitioner’s criminal conviction history, (2) the\npetitioner’s disciplinary and rehabilitation history while incarcerated, and (3) any other\nevidence the trial court deems relevant.\n\n\n\n                                              22.\n\f       In our summary, we reviewed at length the evidence before the trial court. Based\non this evidence, the trial court concluded Givan posed an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety because of the “very dangerous facts surrounding [Givan’s] priors, at least\none in which [Givan] fired a gun at a victim.” The trial court also observed that Givan’s\ndangerous behavior was driven by his use of marijuana, and Givan expressed at the\nhearing the desire to obtain a medical marijuana prescription. The trial court reasoned\nthat if Givan began smoking marijuana again he would return to committing dangerous\ncrimes.\n       The difficulty with the trial court’s analysis is that the facts underlying the primary\nfinding are absent support in the record. The assertion that Givan shot at the victim in the\n1990 burglary is simply not there. While the record and Givan’s testimony are confusing\nas to whether he was armed, the only reference to the firing of a weapon is found in the\npretrial probation report. The report, however, does not state Givan shot a weapon at the\nvictim, only that one of the three perpetrators shot at the victim. Moreover, since the\nmatter proceeded to a jury trial, it appears a pretrial probation report is not the most\nreliable source of factual information about the events that occurred. We also note the\nappellate opinion from that conviction does not indicate the jury found true an arming\nenhancement pertaining to Givan. The only evidence of the arming enhancement was\nfound in the CLETS report submitted by the prosecution, but the reliability of this report\nis also questionable. The CLETS report indicates Givan was convicted of “459 PC-\nBURGLARY: FIRST DEGREE-ARMED WITH FIREARM” and was sentenced to 16\nyears in prison. The sentence indicated in this report is incorrect, bringing into question\nthe reliability of the entire entry. Finally, we observe that the prosecutor conceded there\nwas no evidence Givan shot at the victim.\n\n\n\n\n                                             23.\n\f       In summary, there is no evidence that Givan shot at the victim in the 1990\nburglary, and it is unclear whether Givan was armed during the burglary.5 There is no\nevidence anyone was injured during the burglary, nor is there any evidence Givan used a\nweapon during any other crime or that any of his crimes caused an injury to a victim.6\nTherefore, the evidence does not support the trial court’s assertion that there were “very\ndangerous facts surrounding [Givan’s] priors, at least one in which [Givan] fired a gun at\na victim.”7\n       We also question the trial court’s reliance on Givan’s testimony that he would\nlegally attempt to obtain a medical marijuana prescription if released. The trial court\ninferred from this testimony that if Givan began smoking marijuana, he would return to\nhis life of crime. As this conclusion is not substantiated in the record below, upon return\nto the trial court, if this again forms the basis of the court’s finding of “unreasonable\nrisk,” further articulation will be necessary. An issue may arise if Givan didn’t have the\nfunds to obtain the prescription and the marijuana. However, Givan provided testimony\nthat he would be able to obtain a job driving a truck with his cousin, suggesting he would\nnot have to commit any crimes to obtain funds.8\n       Finally, we note that Givan testified he would strike an individual who refused to\npay wages that Givan had legally earned. While not condoning Givan’s response, we\n\n\n       5Inthe respondent’s brief, the Attorney General states that Givan denied\npossessing a gun during the robbery.\n       6We  acknowledge Givan was convicted of two robberies, but the only evidence\nabout these two incidents was provided by Givan who described them as purse snatching\ncases. He testified he did not use a weapon in these incidents.\n       7It\n         is true, however, the 1990 burglary involved the use of firearms and was thus a\ndangerous crime.\n       8Whether   a truck driver could get a medical marijuana card, or whether he could\ndrive a truck with traces of marijuana in his system, is not an issue we need to decide\nhere.\n\n\n                                             24.\n\fobserve that the hypothetical question posed by the prosecutor was not based on any facts\nand was so inflammatory that any response by Givan would have been considered to his\ndetriment. Had Givan responded he would have been okay without eating or having\nshelter the next month, the conclusion that he was lying could easily have been drawn.\nThere was no right answer to the hypothetical as posed by the prosecutor.\n       It appears the trial court placed principle reliance on its assumption that Givan\nshot at the victim of the 1990 burglary. Because there is nothing in the record to support\nthis assumption, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the petition. (People v.\nCluff, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 998 [trial court abuses discretion if factual finding\ncritical to its decision is not supported by evidence].) Nonetheless, reversal is required\nonly if the error amounted to a miscarriage of justice. (People v. Harris (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842; People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834-836.) Based on the record\nas presented, we must conclude the error amounted to just such a miscarriage.\n       After examining the entire case, we conclude it is reasonably probable that a result\nmore favorable to Givan would have been obtained in the absence of the error, thus\nrequiring reversal of the order denying the petition. (People v. Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d\nat p. 836.) The trial court placed great reliance on Givan’s asserted dangerousness,\nespecially his purportedly firing a firearm at the victim of the 1990 burglary. There was\nno other evidence that, at any time, Givan had used a weapon in the crimes he committed\nor that any victim had ever been injured. Under these circumstances, the appropriate\nremedy is to reverse the order denying the petition.\n       Our reversal of the order denying the petition is not to be read as an order to grant\nthe petition. Our holding is based on the trial court’s reliance on specific facts\nunsupported by the record. Accordingly, we are reversing the order to permit the trial\ncourt to consider all the relevant evidence in the record that is supported by substantial\nevidence and exercise its discretion based on those facts. In doing so, the trial court may\nor may not reach the same conclusion. There are certainly facts that would support either\n\n                                             25.\n\fview. The decision, however, must in the first instance be made by the trial court. In the\nevent the trial court reaches the same conclusion, further articulation regarding the nexus\nbetween marijuana use (or non-use) and “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety”\nwill be necessary.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The order denying the petition is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial\ncourt for reconsideration of Givan’s petition for resentencing in light of this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             26.\n\f</pre>",
