Finney appeals from an order denying his petition for\nresentencing under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012. (Pen. Code,\n§ 1170.126.)1 Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       Defendant, who is serving three concurrent sentences of 25 years to life, has a\ncriminal history that began at age 16, when a juvenile petition was sustained for taking a\nvehicle without permission. Another petition was requested the following year for grand\ntheft auto, and another two years later for burglary.\n       At age 19, defendant was convicted of second degree robbery with use of a gun\n(§§ 211, 12022.5), and received a 7-year prison term. That same year, he was convicted\nof first degree burglary (§ 459), and received a 4-year term.\n       About five years later, while defendant was on parole, he was charged with two\ncounts of robbery (§ 211) and one count of receiving stolen property (§ 496, subd. (a)).\nThe receiving count was dropped, and defendant was held to answer on the two robbery\ncounts. These were consolidated with another case involving three counts of receiving\nstolen property, and the robbery counts were dismissed in return for a waiver of the right\nto jury trial on the receiving stolen property counts. Following a bench trial, defendant\nwas convicted on all three counts. The court denied defendant’s Romero2 motion to\n\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n       2  People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497. Romero held that a\ntrial court may strike or vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction pursuant\nto section 1385, subdivision (a). Such rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n(Id. at p. 504.)\n        In considering whether to strike or vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony\nconviction allegation, a court “must consider whether, in light of the nature and\ncircumstances of [the defendant’s] present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony\nconvictions, and the particulars of [the defendant’s] background, character, and prospects,\nthe defendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence\nshould be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious\nand/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161.)\n                                               2\n\fstrike one or more prior strike convictions, and sentenced him to a third strike sentence of\nthree concurrent terms of 25 years to life. We affirmed his conviction in People v.\nFinney (Nov. 6, 1997, B108415 [nonpub. opn.]).\n       In January 2013, defendant petitioned to recall his sentence and for resentencing\nunder Proposition 36. The trial court found a prima facie showing of eligibility had been\nmade, and issued an order to show cause as to why the petition should not be granted.3\n       The People raised doubts about his suitability “for resentencing due to his prior\ncriminal history and his violent and disruptive behavior while serving his current prison\nsentence.” The People argued that defendant had a “dismal” disciplinary record and had\nbeen found guilty of numerous prison rule violations, many involving violence.4\n\n\n\n\n       3 Resentencing under Proposition 36 is not available to an inmate if (1) the current\nsentence is for a serious drug offense, a felony sex offense requiring registration as a sex\noffender, or a felony involving a firearm, a deadly weapon, or the intent to cause great\nbodily injury; or (2) the inmate has been convicted of one of the felonies Proposition 36\ndesignates as the most serious and violent offenses. (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2) & (3).)\nThe disqualifying felonies are (a) sexually violent offense; (b) oral copulation, sodomy,\nsexual penetration, or a lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of age;\n(c) any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide; (d) solicitation to commit\nmurder; (e) assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter; (f) possession of\na weapon of mass destruction; and (g) any serious or violent felony offense punishable in\nCalifornia by life imprisonment or death. (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)(iv).)\n\n       4 While in prison, defendant obtained a GED, did vocational and clerical work\n(2001-2003), had a job in the kitchen (2007, February 2013 to present), and worked as a\nbarber (2010).\n        From 1997 to 2011, defendant was found guilty of 10 prison rule violations: (1)\nbattery on an inmate with serious injury (Nov. 1997); (2) battery on an inmate without\nserious injury (Dec. 1997); (3) battery on an inmate (Dec. 1998); (4) refusal to obey a\ndirect order (June 1998); (5) unlawful assembly (March 2001); (6) battery on a\ncorrectional officer (Nov. 2003); (7) battery on an inmate without serious injury (March\n2004); (8) possession of a deadly weapon (April 2008); (9) possession of a cell phone\n(March 2010); and (10) obstructing a peace officer by participating in a hunger strike\n(Sept. 2011). In 1996, his prison classification score was 58. It climbed to 162 in 2005,\ndecreased to 152 in 2007, rose to 174 the following year, and dropped to 160 in 2013.\n                                             3\n\f       At the suitability hearing, defendant testified that he had sought to participate in\neducational, self-help, and other training programs while in prison, but these programs\nwere not readily available for a “level 4 lifer.” Defendant’s supporting evidence included\na positive work evaluation in February 2013; an undated letter promising him\nemployment at a Best Buy in West Hollywood (the author was currently working in\nTurkey); a January 2014 letter from a friend who managed a termite control business and\nwas willing to hire him; a January 2014 letter promising him a job interview at the church\nwhere his mother was employed; his mother’s December 2013 letter requesting his\nrelease; and a letter from his fiancée who was planning to hire him as caregiver for her\n15-year-old disabled son.\n       After noting that defendant appeared to have supportive family and friends, was\nplanning to live with his mother or fiancée, and had “at least a temporary job looking\nafter [his fiancée’s] child,” the court took the matter under submission. In a detailed 18-\npage ruling, the court found defendant was ineligible for resentencing as a second strike\noffender under Proposition 36 because, due to his serious record of violence and\nmisconduct while in prison, his resentencing would pose a substantial risk of danger to\npublic safety. (§ 1170.126, subds. (f) & (g).)\n       The trial court’s ruling provided numerous reasons for the denial of the petition:\n“Even minor misconduct, when it indicates that an inmate is unwilling to adhere to\ninstitutional rules or parole conditions, may constitute some evidence that he is unable or\nunwilling to conform to the requirements of the law and is, therefore a current danger to\npublic safety and unsuitable for release. In re Reed (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1071, 1084–\n1086. [¶] In the Petitioner’s case, the record indicates that the Petitioner has repeatedly\ncommitted serious misconduct while in prison, several of which involve violence.”\n       “By far the most serious rule violation is the battery on a correctional officer,\noriginally filed as attempted murder of a correctional officer. On November 21, 2003,\ntwo correctional officers, Burhammer and Silva, were responding to a request for\nassistance by other officers in conducting an unclothed body search of inmates in an\nexercise yard when 30 to 40 inmates attacked the two officers. As part of this melee,\n\n                                              4\n\fFinney grabbed Burkhammer’s baton and tried to take it from him while other inmates\nwere physically assaulting Burkhammer on the head and chest with their feet and fists.\nBurkhammer felt that if Finney got a hold of the baton, Finney would have killed him.\nAfterwards, Finney was heard to say, ‘They can’t ID us, we’re okay. We’re gonna get\naway with it.’\n       “As it turned out, Finney was mistaken. Finney was charged with attempted\nmurder of a peace officer. The Senior Hearing Officer found that the facts did not\nsupport the attempted murder charge, but did support a finding of guilt for acting in\nconcert with other inmates to batter a peace officer. Due to a long delay in scheduling the\nhearing, however, Finney did not lose any behavioral credits. Instead, he lost 90 days use\nof the phones with credit for time served in Administrative Segregation.\n       “This incident is not the only example of an unprovoked violent attack perpetrated\nby Finney while in prison; there are four others. On March 5, 2004, Finney was\nconvicted of battery on an inmate. Finney and another inmate attacked a third inmate\nwithout provocation. They punched the third inmate in the head and torso with their fists.\nAlthough ordered down, they did not comply and the officers had to use a water cannon\nto stop the fight. A SHU [solitary housing unit] placement was recommended for Finney.\n       “In 1999, Finney was convicted of battery on an inmate that occurred on\nDecember 18, 1998. Finney and one other inmate attacked a third inmate by repeatedly\npunching him in the head and torso area. They were all ordered down but did not\ncomply. The officers had to use a multiple baton round from a 37 mm launcher to obtain\ncompliance, which still resulted in negative compliance from the inmates. Finney lost 90\ndays of behavior credits and 90 days of privileges.\n       “In 1998, Finney was convicted of two separate charges of battery committed in\nDecember 1997. The first incident occurred on December 4, 1997 and resulted in\nFinney’s conviction of battery on an inmate with serious bodily injury. Finney and\nanother inmate attacked a third inmate from behind. The victim suffered a severe\nlaceration to his right forearm. The laceration was so serious that at the hearing over a\n\n\n                                             5\n\fmonth later, the victim was unable to personally appear and testified via telephone from\nthe prison infirmary.\n       “The second incident occurred on December 25, 1997 and resulted in Finney’s\nconviction of battery on a prisoner. Finney and three other inmates attacked another\ninmate with fists, hitting him in the head and upper torso area. The officers ordered the\ninmates on the yard down but Finney and the other inmates failed to comply. The\nofficers utilized pepper spray as well as triple charger grenades to gain compliance.\n       “These also are not the only serious rules violations Finney has committed. As\nrecently as 2011, Finney was convicted of obstructing a correctional officer by\nparticipating in a mass disturbance/hunger strike. Additionally, in 2010, Finney was\nconvicted of possession of contraband (cellphone). He was assessed a loss of 30 days of\nbehavioral credits and 90 days loss of phone, package, and canteen privileges. In 2008,\nFinney was also convicted of another serious rules violation. Correctional officers found\nthree inmate manufactured metal stabbing weapons in the Petitioner’s cell toilet. Two\nwere six inches long and one was four inches long. All three had been sharpened to a\npoint. The hearing officer found him guilty and assessed a forfeiture of 360 days of\nbehavior credit.\n       “The fact that Finney’s most recent serious rules violation occurred in 2011 does\nnot lessen its probative value of current dangerousness. In In re Bettencourt (2007) 156\nCal.App.4th 780, the petitioner was serving a term of 15 to life for a 1981 murder. The\nBoard of Prison Terms (now the Board of Parole Hearings) denied Bettencourt parole, in\npart due to his serious rules violations. He sought habeas relief in the Superior Court,\nwhich was eventually granted. The Warden then sought writ relief in the Court of\nAppeal. The Court of Appeal reversed the Superior Court’s decision and ordered the\npetition denied. The Court of Appeal, noting that Bettencourt had 10 serious rules\nviolations while in prison, the most recent of which was four years prior to the Board\nhearing, stated that ‘the passage of time does not necessarily negate any parole\nunsuitability factor.’ Id. at 805. Thus, this court is not required to ignore or even\ndiscount Finney’s serious misconduct in prison just because the last rule violation\n\n                                              6\n\foccurred three years ago. At that point he had been in prison for 16 years and yet he was\nstill engaging in serious rule-breaking.\n       “While in prison, Finney has engaged continuously in serious misconduct on\nmultiple occasions, including as recently as 2011 which shows his unwillingness to\nconform his conduct to institutional requirements. This is very persuasive evidence that\nhe cannot or will not conform his conduct to the requirements of the law if released,\nmaking him unsuitable for resentencing at this time.\n       “Finney’s rehabilitative programming is also rather weak. There is no evidence\nthat he has attended any behavior modification programming that would help him to gain\ninsight into the causative factors of his criminality, such as anger management and victim\nawareness programming. A 128G chrono by the classification committee dated\nNovember 20, 2013 reports that Finney has requested AA/NA and anger management\nclasses, but the court notes that this request occurred over a year after the TSRA [Three\nStrikes Reform Act of 2012] passed and after Finney filed his petition in this court,\nmaking his motivation and sincerity somewhat suspect. Finney has also written two\nletters to the court asking to be resentenced; however, in neither of them does he express\nremorse for his actions and what he did to the victims. This failure strongly suggests that\nhe lacks insight in to the causative factors of his crimes or how they impacted the victims.\n       “The Court also considered the Petitioner’s proposed post-release housing and\nemployment plans. The Petitioner stated that he had guarantees of employment and\nletters of support from his family to house and feed him after release. Finney has\nprovided letters which purport to offer employment, but a close read of them makes them\ntoo indefinite to be accorded much weight. The first is from a longtime friend offering to\nhire him at a termite eradication company. It is not on the company’s letterhead and does\nnot specify what sort of work Finney would be doing. The other, from the Church of the\nBlessed Sacrament, indicates that Finney’s mother attends services there. The author\nstates that she has never met Finney but there is ‘a possibility’ of working with the church\nupon interview. Again, it is silent as to what sort of work is contemplated.\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       “The Petitioner has not adequately provided, to the satisfaction of the court, plans\nfor employment, housing, and any further programming he will need in order to properly\ntransition back into free society. There is no confirmation that the Petitioner will be\naccepted into a post-release transitional program in order to facilitate reintegration into\nsociety.\n       “While these factors, alone, may not justify a finding of unsuitability, the court\nmay properly consider them, as it is relevant to a determination of whether an inmate is\nsuitable for resentencing. Cf. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 2281, subd. (b).\n       “The Court also considered the Petitioner’s post-conviction gains, including\ngetting his GED and work experience. The court, however, finds these gains were\noutweighed by factors not supportive of Finney’s suitability. The Petitioner’s serious\nmisconduct in prison, lack of significant rehabilitative programming, and weak re-entry\nplans support a finding that resentencing Finney at this time poses an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.\n       “For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Petitioner is NOT SUITABLE\nfor resentencing pursuant to Penal Code § 1170.126. The Order To Show Cause is\ntherefore DISCHARGED and the Petition is DENIED.” This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       In November 2012, the California electorate enacted Proposition 36, which\namended the Three Strikes law by limiting the imposition of a 25-years-to-life sentence\nupon the conviction of a third felony. Under Proposition 36, “a defendant convicted of\ntwo prior serious or violent felonies is subject to the 25-year-to-life sentence only if the\nthird felony is itself a serious or violent felony. If the third felony is not a serious or\nviolent felony, the defendant will receive a sentence as though the defendant had only\none prior serious or violent felony conviction, and is therefore a second-strike, rather than\na third-strike, offender. [Proposition 36] also provides a means whereby prisoners\ncurrently serving sentences of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction which was not\na serious or violent felony may seek court review of their indeterminate sentences and,\n\n                                                8\n\funder certain circumstances, obtain resentencing as if they had only one prior serious or\nviolent felony conviction. According to the specific language of [Proposition 36],\nhowever, a current inmate is not entitled to resentencing if it would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety.” (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215\nCal.App.4th 1279, 1285–1286, fn. omitted (Kaulick).)\n       A.     Kaulick\n       In Kaulick, Division Three of this district held that before a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 may be decided: “(1) the prosecution has the right\nto notice and an opportunity to be heard; (2) both the defendant and the victim have the\nright to be heard at any hearing on a petition for resentencing under the Act; (3) the\nresentencing should take place before the original sentencing judge, if available, although\nthis is waivable; [and] (4) as to the issue of burden of proof of the issue of dangerousness,\nthe prosecution must establish such dangerousness by a preponderance of the\nevidence . . . .” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1291–1292.)\n       The defendant in Kaulick argued that because the dangerousness exception in\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 would expose him to a sentence in excess of the\nstatutorily presumed second strike sentence, he was entitled to a jury trial and to proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt under Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, 490,\nBlakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296, 303, and Cunningham v. California (2007)\n549 U.S. 270, 281. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301–1302.) The court\nrejected this contention, reasoning that section 1170.126, subdivision (f) provides that the\ndefendant “‘shall be resentenced’ to a second strike sentence ‘unless the court . . .\ndetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety.’ In other words, dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence\nimposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a\nhurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all. If the\ncourt finds that resentencing a prisoner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, the\ncourt does not resentence the prisoner, and the petitioner simply finishes out the term to\n\n\n                                              9\n\fwhich he or she was originally sentenced.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1302–1303, fn. omitted.)\n       Kaulick explains that the “retrospective part of the Act is not constitutionally\nrequired, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate. It does not provide for\nwholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a proceeding where\nthe original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at such a proceeding,\nsuch as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues. Thus, there is no\nconstitutional requirement that the facts be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n[¶] Instead, we conclude the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.\nEvidence Code section 115 provides that, ‘[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the\nburden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.’ There is no statute\nor case authority providing for a greater burden, and [defendant] has not persuaded us\nthat any greater burden is necessary. In contrast, it is the general rule in California that\nonce a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. (In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557.) As dangerousness is such a\nfactor, preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard.” (Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1304–1305, fns. omitted.)\n       Defendant contends that Kaulick was wrongly decided, and that he is entitled to a\njury trial on the issue of dangerousness, which must be established beyond a reasonable\ndoubt because it is an aggravating factor that increases the legally prescribed second-\nstrike sentence that, as one who meets the eligibility requirements of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), he must receive. We are not persuaded. We agree with Kaulick’s\nanalysis and similarly conclude that the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the\nevidence, and that no jury trial on the issue of dangerousness is required.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       B.     The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in finding that his\nresentencing as a second strike offender would create an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety and that his parole plans are inadequate. We find no abuse of discretion.5\n       The factors to be considered in determining whether resentencing the petitioner\nwould create an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety include: “(1) The\npetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the\nextent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of\nthe crimes; (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\nincarcerated; and (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be\nrelevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       As previously discussed, the trial court provided a detailed explanation of its\ndetermination that resentencing defendant as a second strike offender would create an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Under the deferential abuse of discretion\nstandard of review, that ruling will be upheld on appeal unless it “‘falls outside the\nbounds of reason’ under the applicable law and the relevant facts [citations].” (People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 162.) We find no abuse of discretion in this case.\n       Given the length of time already served by defendant, the granting of his petition\nfor resentencing would render him eligible for immediate release. Defendant argues the\ndenial of his petition is akin to the denial of parole, which would be reviewed under the\n“some evidence” standard of review. In the parole suitability context, “a court must\nconsider whether ‘some evidence in the record before the Board supports the decision to\ndeny parole, based upon the factors specified by statute and regulation.” (In re Lawrence\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1210.) Under the deferential “some evidence” standard of\n\n\n       5 Whether the abuse of discretion standard of review applies to resentencing\npetition orders is an issue now pending before the Supreme Court in People v. Aparicio\n(2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1065, review granted Mar. 25, 2015, S224317, briefing deferred\npursuant to rule 8.520, Cal. Rules of Court.\n                                             11\n\freview, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the parole board, and the\nstandard of review “‘simply ensures that parole decisions are supported by a modicum of\nevidence and are not arbitrary and capricious.’ [Citation.]” (In re Bettencourt, supra,\n156 Cal.App.4th at p. 798.) Given the numerous findings of misconduct in defendant’s\nprison file, many of which involved violence and included a finding of battery against a\nprison guard, we conclude the trial court’s ruling is supported by more than some\nevidence.\n       Defendant’s assertion that he falls outside the “spirit” of the Three Strikes law is\nnot compelling. The trial court denied defendant’s Romero motion, thus finding him\nwithin the spirit of that law.\n       C.     Propositions 36 and 47\n       Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, was enacted while this\nappeal was pending. Under Proposition 47, certain drug- and theft-related offenses were\ndesignated as misdemeanors; previously the same offenses were punishable as felonies or\nmisdemeanors depending on the underlying facts. (People v. Rivera (2015) 233\nCal.App.4th 1085, 1091 [Rivera].) Proposition 47 allows an inmate to petition for\nresentencing if he or she is currently serving a felony sentence for a crime Proposition 47\nnow designates as a misdemeanor. (§1170.18, subd. (a); Rivera, at p. 1092.)\n       If the petitioner meets the criteria for resentencing, his or her “felony sentence\nshall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in\nits discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b); see Rivera, at p. 1092.) The standard\nused in Proposition 36 for determining whether a person should be resentenced is also\nused in Proposition 47. The identical three factors are to be considered in making the\ndetermination under both statutes. (Compare § 1170.18, subd. (b) with § 1170.126,\nsubd. (g).)\n       Section 1170.18, subdivision (c) states, “As used throughout this Code,\n‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\n\n                                             12\n\fsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (c), italics added.) The phrase, a “new violent felony,” refers to the same felonies\nthat disqualify an inmate from resentencing under Proposition 36. (Compare § 1170.18,\nsubd. (c) with § 1170.126, subd. (e)(3).)\n       Defendant contends that Proposition 47’s definition of the phrase, “unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety,” applies retroactively to resentencing petitions under\nProposition 36. That issue also is pending before the Supreme Court. (People v. Chaney\n(2015) 231 Cal.App.4th 1391, review granted Feb. 18, 2015, S223676; People v.\nValencia (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 514, review granted Feb. 18, 2015, S223825.).\n       We conclude that section 1170.18 subdivision (c)’s definition does not apply to\npetitions for resentencing under Proposition 36. Other courts have reached the same\ndecision, and the issue is pending before the Supreme Court. (People v. Guzman (2015)\n235 Cal.App.4th 711, review granted June 17, 2015, S226410, briefing deferred pursuant\nto rule 8.520 Cal. Rules of Court; People v. Davis (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1001, review\ngranted June 10, 2015, S225603, briefing deferred pursuant to rule 8.520 Cal. Rules of\nCourt.)\n       The Sixth District recently held that section 1170.18 subdivision (c)’s definition\ncontains an obvious drafting error. (People v. Lopez (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 518\n(Lopez).) The court examined the statutory definition and concluded “that the word\n‘Code’ was ‘erroneously used’ in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) rather than the word\n‘Act,’ to refer to the SNS [Safe Neighborhoods and Schools] Act, and therefore this error\nis properly subjected to ‘judicial correction.’ The ‘purpose’ of section 1170.18 and ‘the\nintent of the electorate’ in enacting it unambiguously demonstrate that the voters did not\nintend to alter the Reform Act or section 1170.126 in any way or to require the\nresentencing of any person serving a sentence for a crime other than one of the specified\nnonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes.” (Id. at p. 527.)\n       Lopez identified three grounds in support of its determination.\n       “First, because Proposition 47’s ballot materials and proposed statutory language\ncontained nothing whatsoever to suggest that Proposition 47 would have any impact on\n\n                                             13\n\fthe resentencing of anyone who was serving a sentence for a crime other than one of the\nspecified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes, it is inconceivable that voters\nintended for subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 to severely restrict the ability of a court to\nreject a resentencing petition under the Reform Act by a person convicted of crimes other\nthan one of the specified property or drug crimes and whom the court considered\ndangerous. The Proposition 47 ballot materials contained no mention of such a possible\nconsequence and the only hint was the use of the word ‘Code’ rather than ‘Act’ in an\nobscure subdivision of the lengthy proposed act. The ballot materials repeatedly\nemphasized that the resentencing provisions of Proposition 47, which were contained in\nsection 1170.18, were limited to only those persons serving sentences for the specified\nnonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes.\n       “Second, the timing of Proposition 47 makes an intent to alter the Reform Act\nillogical. The Reform Act required petitions to be brought within two years unless a\ncourt concluded that there was good cause for a late-filed petition. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (b).) By the time Proposition 47 took effect, only two days remained in the two-\nyear period for filing a Reform Act petition. No rational voter could have intended to\nchange the rules for Reform Act petitions at the last moment, when nearly all petitions\nwould already have been filed and most of them adjudicated.\n       “Third, the structure and content of section 1170.18 is inconsistent with an intent\nto apply section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s definition throughout the entire Penal Code.\nSubdivision (n) of section 1170.18 provides: ‘Nothing in this and related sections is\nintended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within\nthe purview of this act.’ (§ 1170.18, subd. (n), italics added.) Applying section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition throughout the Penal Code would necessarily ‘diminish or\nabrogate the finality of judgments’ in cases, like those subject to the Reform Act, that do\nnot fall ‘within the purview of’ Proposition 47. Defendant’s petition under the Reform\nAct, like most such petitions, seeks to abrogate the finality of a Three Strikes judgment in\na case that does not involve one of the specified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug\ncrimes. Thus, under section 1170.18, subdivision (n), ‘[n]othing’ in section 1170.18 was\n\n                                              14\n\fintended to apply to his petition. In addition, the wording of section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) is itself inconsistent with an intent to apply it ‘throughout’ the entire Penal\nCode. It refers to ‘petitioners’ and defines a phrase that appears in only two sections of\nthe Penal Code, section 1170.18 and section 1170.126. If the voters had intended to\napply this definition to Reform Act petitions, this phrasing would have been the most\nroundabout means of doing so. Since the ballot materials made no mention of the\nReform Act, we will not ascribe such unreasonable conduct to the voters.” (People v.\nLopez, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at pp. 527–528.)\n        We agree with this analysis and similarly conclude that Proposition 47’s definition\nof the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” does not apply retroactively\nto resentencing under Proposition 36. We therefore reject the contention that Proposition\n47’s definition of the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” applies to this\ncase.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n        The order is affirmed.\n        NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n\n\n\n                                                   EPSTEIN, P.

Finney appeals from an order denying his petition for\nresentencing under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012. (Pen. Code,\n§ 1170.126.)1 Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       Defendant, who is serving three concurrent sentences of 25 years to life, has a\ncriminal history that began at age 16, when a juvenile petition was sustained for taking a\nvehicle without permission. Another petition was requested the following year for grand\ntheft auto, and another two years later for burglary.\n       At age 19, defendant was convicted of second degree robbery with use of a gun\n(§§ 211, 12022.5), and received a 7-year prison term. That same year, he was convicted\nof first degree burglary (§ 459), and received a 4-year term.\n       About five years later, while defendant was on parole, he was charged with two\ncounts of robbery (§ 211) and one count of receiving stolen property (§ 496, subd. (a)).\nThe receiving count was dropped, and defendant was held to answer on the two robbery\ncounts. These were consolidated with another case involving three counts of receiving\nstolen property, and the robbery counts were dismissed in return for a waiver of the right\nto jury trial on the receiving stolen property counts. Following a bench trial, defendant\nwas convicted on all three counts. The court denied defendant’s Romero2 motion to\n\n\n       1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n       2  People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135929\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135929/people-v-superior-court-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Romero held that a\ntrial court may strike or vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony conviction pursuant\nto section 1385, subdivision (a). Such rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n(Id. at p. 504.)\n        In considering whether to strike or vacate a prior serious and/or violent felony\nconviction allegation, a court “must consider whether, in light of the nature and\ncircumstances of [the defendant’s] present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony\nconvictions, and the particulars of [the defendant’s] background, character, and prospects,\nthe defendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence\nshould be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious\nand/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125054\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125054/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 161.)\n                                               2\n\fstrike one or more prior strike convictions, and sentenced him to a third strike sentence of\nthree concurrent terms of 25 years to life. We affirmed his conviction in People v.\nFinney (Nov. 6, 1997, B108415 [nonpub. opn.]).\n       In January 2013, defendant petitioned to recall his sentence and for resentencing\nunder Proposition 36. The trial court found a prima facie showing of eligibility had been\nmade, and issued an order to show cause as to why the petition should not be granted.3\n       The People raised doubts about his suitability “for resentencing due to his prior\ncriminal history and his violent and disruptive behavior while serving his current prison\nsentence.” The People argued that defendant had a “dismal” disciplinary record and had\nbeen found guilty of numerous prison rule violations, many involving violence.4\n\n\n\n\n       3 Resentencing under Proposition 36 is not available to an inmate if (1) the current\nsentence is for a serious drug offense, a felony sex offense requiring registration as a sex\noffender, or a felony involving a firearm, a deadly weapon, or the intent to cause great\nbodily injury; or (2) the inmate has been convicted of one of the felonies Proposition 36\ndesignates as the most serious and violent offenses. (§ 1170.126, subd. (e)(2) & (3).)\nThe disqualifying felonies are (a) sexually violent offense; (b) oral copulation, sodomy,\nsexual penetration, or a lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of age;\n(c) any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide; (d) solicitation to commit\nmurder; (e) assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter; (f) possession of\na weapon of mass destruction; and (g) any serious or violent felony offense punishable in\nCalifornia by life imprisonment or death. (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)(iv).)\n\n       4 While in prison, defendant obtained a GED, did vocational and clerical work\n(2001-2003), had a job in the kitchen (2007, February 2013 to present), and worked as a\nbarber (2010).\n        From 1997 to 2011, defendant was found guilty of 10 prison rule violations: (1)\nbattery on an inmate with serious injury (Nov. 1997); (2) battery on an inmate without\nserious injury (Dec. 1997); (3) battery on an inmate (Dec. 1998); (4) refusal to obey a\ndirect order (June 1998); (5) unlawful assembly (March 2001); (6) battery on a\ncorrectional officer (Nov. 2003); (7) battery on an inmate without serious injury (March\n2004); (8) possession of a deadly weapon (April 2008); (9) possession of a cell phone\n(March 2010); and (10) obstructing a peace officer by participating in a hunger strike\n(Sept. 2011). In 1996, his prison classification score was 58. It climbed to 162 in 2005,\ndecreased to 152 in 2007, rose to 174 the following year, and dropped to 160 in 2013.\n                                             3\n\f       At the suitability hearing, defendant testified that he had sought to participate in\neducational, self-help, and other training programs while in prison, but these programs\nwere not readily available for a “level 4 lifer.” Defendant’s supporting evidence included\na positive work evaluation in February 2013; an undated letter promising him\nemployment at a Best Buy in West Hollywood (the author was currently working in\nTurkey); a January 2014 letter from a friend who managed a termite control business and\nwas willing to hire him; a January 2014 letter promising him a job interview at the church\nwhere his mother was employed; his mother’s December 2013 letter requesting his\nrelease; and a letter from his fiancée who was planning to hire him as caregiver for her\n15-year-old disabled son.\n       After noting that defendant appeared to have supportive family and friends, was\nplanning to live with his mother or fiancée, and had “at least a temporary job looking\nafter [his fiancée’s] child,” the court took the matter under submission. In a detailed 18-\npage ruling, the court found defendant was ineligible for resentencing as a second strike\noffender under Proposition 36 because, due to his serious record of violence and\nmisconduct while in prison, his resentencing would pose a substantial risk of danger to\npublic safety. (§ 1170.126, subds. (f) & (g).)\n       The trial court’s ruling provided numerous reasons for the denial of the petition:\n“Even minor misconduct, when it indicates that an inmate is unwilling to adhere to\ninstitutional rules or parole conditions, may constitute some evidence that he is unable or\nunwilling to conform to the requirements of the law and is, therefore a current danger to\npublic safety and unsuitable for release.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084–\n1086. [¶] In the Petitioner’s case, the record indicates that the Petitioner has repeatedly\ncommitted serious misconduct while in prison, several of which involve violence.”\n       “By far the most serious rule violation is the battery on a correctional officer,\noriginally filed as attempted murder of a correctional officer. On November 21, 2003,\ntwo correctional officers, Burhammer and Silva, were responding to a request for\nassistance by other officers in conducting an unclothed body search of inmates in an\nexercise yard when 30 to 40 inmates attacked the two officers. As part of this melee,\n\n                                              4\n\fFinney grabbed Burkhammer’s baton and tried to take it from him while other inmates\nwere physically assaulting Burkhammer on the head and chest with their feet and fists.\nBurkhammer felt that if Finney got a hold of the baton, Finney would have killed him.\nAfterwards, Finney was heard to say, ‘They can’t ID us, we’re okay. We’re gonna get\naway with it.’\n       “As it turned out, Finney was mistaken. Finney was charged with attempted\nmurder of a peace officer. The Senior Hearing Officer found that the facts did not\nsupport the attempted murder charge, but did support a finding of guilt for acting in\nconcert with other inmates to batter a peace officer. Due to a long delay in scheduling the\nhearing, however, Finney did not lose any behavioral credits. Instead, he lost 90 days use\nof the phones with credit for time served in Administrative Segregation.\n       “This incident is not the only example of an unprovoked violent attack perpetrated\nby Finney while in prison; there are four others. On March 5, 2004, Finney was\nconvicted of battery on an inmate. Finney and another inmate attacked a third inmate\nwithout provocation. They punched the third inmate in the head and torso with their fists.\nAlthough ordered down, they did not comply and the officers had to use a water cannon\nto stop the fight. A SHU [solitary housing unit] placement was recommended for Finney.\n       “In 1999, Finney was convicted of battery on an inmate that occurred on\nDecember 18, 1998. Finney and one other inmate attacked a third inmate by repeatedly\npunching him in the head and torso area. They were all ordered down but did not\ncomply. The officers had to use a multiple baton round from a 37 mm launcher to obtain\ncompliance, which still resulted in negative compliance from the inmates. Finney lost 90\ndays of behavior credits and 90 days of privileges.\n       “In 1998, Finney was convicted of two separate charges of battery committed in\nDecember 1997. The first incident occurred on December 4, 1997 and resulted in\nFinney’s conviction of battery on an inmate with serious bodily injury. Finney and\nanother inmate attacked a third inmate from behind. The victim suffered a severe\nlaceration to his right forearm. The laceration was so serious that at the hearing over a\n\n\n                                             5\n\fmonth later, the victim was unable to personally appear and testified via telephone from\nthe prison infirmary.\n       “The second incident occurred on December 25, 1997 and resulted in Finney’s\nconviction of battery on a prisoner. Finney and three other inmates attacked another\ninmate with fists, hitting him in the head and upper torso area. The officers ordered the\ninmates on the yard down but Finney and the other inmates failed to comply. The\nofficers utilized pepper spray as well as triple charger grenades to gain compliance.\n       “These also are not the only serious rules violations Finney has committed. As\nrecently as 2011, Finney was convicted of obstructing a correctional officer by\nparticipating in a mass disturbance/hunger strike. Additionally, in 2010, Finney was\nconvicted of possession of contraband (cellphone). He was assessed a loss of 30 days of\nbehavioral credits and 90 days loss of phone, package, and canteen privileges. In 2008,\nFinney was also convicted of another serious rules violation. Correctional officers found\nthree inmate manufactured metal stabbing weapons in the Petitioner’s cell toilet. Two\nwere six inches long and one was four inches long. All three had been sharpened to a\npoint. The hearing officer found him guilty and assessed a forfeiture of 360 days of\nbehavior credit.\n       “The fact that Finney’s most recent serious rules violation occurred in 2011 does\nnot lessen its probative value of current dangerousness. In In re Bettencourt (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2290568\"><a href=\"/opinion/2290568/in-re-bettencourt/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the petitioner was serving a term of 15 to life for a 1981 murder. The\nBoard of Prison Terms (now the Board of Parole Hearings) denied Bettencourt parole, in\npart due to his serious rules violations. He sought habeas relief in the Superior Court,\nwhich was eventually granted. The Warden then sought writ relief in the Court of\nAppeal. The Court of Appeal reversed the Superior Court’s decision and ordered the\npetition denied. The Court of Appeal, noting that Bettencourt had 10 serious rules\nviolations while in prison, the most recent of which was four years prior to the Board\nhearing, stated that ‘the passage of time does not necessarily negate any parole\nunsuitability factor.’ Id. at 805. Thus, this court is not required to ignore or even\ndiscount Finney’s serious misconduct in prison just because the last rule violation\n\n                                              6\n\foccurred three years ago. At that point he had been in prison for 16 years and yet he was\nstill engaging in serious rule-breaking.\n       “While in prison, Finney has engaged continuously in serious misconduct on\nmultiple occasions, including as recently as 2011 which shows his unwillingness to\nconform his conduct to institutional requirements. This is very persuasive evidence that\nhe cannot or will not conform his conduct to the requirements of the law if released,\nmaking him unsuitable for resentencing at this time.\n       “Finney’s rehabilitative programming is also rather weak. There is no evidence\nthat he has attended any behavior modification programming that would help him to gain\ninsight into the causative factors of his criminality, such as anger management and victim\nawareness programming. A 128G chrono by the classification committee dated\nNovember 20, 2013 reports that Finney has requested AA/NA and anger management\nclasses, but the court notes that this request occurred over a year after the TSRA [Three\nStrikes Reform Act of 2012] passed and after Finney filed his petition in this court,\nmaking his motivation and sincerity somewhat suspect. Finney has also written two\nletters to the court asking to be resentenced; however, in neither of them does he express\nremorse for his actions and what he did to the victims. This failure strongly suggests that\nhe lacks insight in to the causative factors of his crimes or how they impacted the victims.\n       “The Court also considered the Petitioner’s proposed post-release housing and\nemployment plans. The Petitioner stated that he had guarantees of employment and\nletters of support from his family to house and feed him after release. Finney has\nprovided letters which purport to offer employment, but a close read of them makes them\ntoo indefinite to be accorded much weight. The first is from a longtime friend offering to\nhire him at a termite eradication company. It is not on the company’s letterhead and does\nnot specify what sort of work Finney would be doing. The other, from the Church of the\nBlessed Sacrament, indicates that Finney’s mother attends services there. The author\nstates that she has never met Finney but there is ‘a possibility’ of working with the church\nupon interview. Again, it is silent as to what sort of work is contemplated.\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       “The Petitioner has not adequately provided, to the satisfaction of the court, plans\nfor employment, housing, and any further programming he will need in order to properly\ntransition back into free society. There is no confirmation that the Petitioner will be\naccepted into a post-release transitional program in order to facilitate reintegration into\nsociety.\n       “While these factors, alone, may not justify a finding of unsuitability, the court\nmay properly consider them, as it is relevant to a determination of whether an inmate is\nsuitable for resentencing. Cf. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 2281, subd. (b).\n       “The Court also considered the Petitioner’s post-conviction gains, including\ngetting his GED and work experience. The court, however, finds these gains were\noutweighed by factors not supportive of Finney’s suitability. The Petitioner’s serious\nmisconduct in prison, lack of significant rehabilitative programming, and weak re-entry\nplans support a finding that resentencing Finney at this time poses an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.\n       “For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Petitioner is NOT SUITABLE\nfor resentencing pursuant to Penal Code § 1170.126. The Order To Show Cause is\ntherefore DISCHARGED and the Petition is DENIED.” This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       In November 2012, the California electorate enacted Proposition 36, which\namended the Three Strikes law by limiting the imposition of a 25-years-to-life sentence\nupon the conviction of a third felony. Under Proposition 36, “a defendant convicted of\ntwo prior serious or violent felonies is subject to the 25-year-to-life sentence only if the\nthird felony is itself a serious or violent felony. If the third felony is not a serious or\nviolent felony, the defendant will receive a sentence as though the defendant had only\none prior serious or violent felony conviction, and is therefore a second-strike, rather than\na third-strike, offender. [Proposition 36] also provides a means whereby prisoners\ncurrently serving sentences of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction which was not\na serious or violent felony may seek court review of their indeterminate sentences and,\n\n                                                8\n\funder certain circumstances, obtain resentencing as if they had only one prior serious or\nviolent felony conviction. According to the specific language of [Proposition 36],\nhowever, a current inmate is not entitled to resentencing if it would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety.” (People v.

Kaulick\n       In Kaulick, Division Three of this district held that before a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 may be decided: “(1) the prosecution has the right\nto notice and an opportunity to be heard; (2) both the defendant and the victim have the\nright to be heard at any hearing on a petition for resentencing under the Act; (3) the\nresentencing should take place before the original sentencing judge, if available, although\nthis is waivable; [and] (4) as to the issue of burden of proof of the issue of dangerousness,\nthe prosecution must establish such dangerousness by a preponderance of the\nevidence . . . .” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1291–1292.)\n       The defendant in Kaulick argued that because the dangerousness exception in\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 would expose him to a sentence in excess of the\nstatutorily presumed second strike sentence, he was entitled to a jury trial and to proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt under Apprendi v.

(Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301–1302.) The court\nrejected this contention, reasoning that section 1170.126, subdivision (f) provides that the\ndefendant “‘shall be resentenced’ to a second strike sentence ‘unless the court . . .\ndetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety.’ In other words, dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence\nimposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a\nhurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all. If the\ncourt finds that resentencing a prisoner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, the\ncourt does not resentence the prisoner, and the petitioner simply finishes out the term to\n\n\n                                              9\n\fwhich he or she was originally sentenced.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1302–1303, fn. omitted.)\n       Kaulick explains that the “retrospective part of the Act is not constitutionally\nrequired, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate. It does not provide for\nwholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a proceeding where\nthe original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at such a proceeding,\nsuch as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues. Thus, there is no\nconstitutional requirement that the facts be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\n[¶] Instead, we conclude the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.\nEvidence Code section 115 provides that, ‘[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the\nburden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.’ There is no statute\nor case authority providing for a greater burden, and [defendant] has not persuaded us\nthat any greater burden is necessary. In contrast, it is the general rule in California that\nonce a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. (In re Coley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557.) As dangerousness is such a\nfactor, preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard.” (Kaulick, supra, 215\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1304–1305, fns. omitted.)\n       Defendant contends that Kaulick was wrongly decided, and that he is entitled to a\njury trial on the issue of dangerousness, which must be established beyond a reasonable\ndoubt because it is an aggravating factor that increases the legally prescribed second-\nstrike sentence that, as one who meets the eligibility requirements of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), he must receive. We are not persuaded. We agree with Kaulick’s\nanalysis and similarly conclude that the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the\nevidence, and that no jury trial on the issue of dangerousness is required.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       B.     The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in finding that his\nresentencing as a second strike offender would create an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety and that his parole plans are inadequate. We find no abuse of discretion.5\n       The factors to be considered in determining whether resentencing the petitioner\nwould create an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety include: “(1) The\npetitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the\nextent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of\nthe crimes; (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while\nincarcerated; and (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be\nrelevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       As previously discussed, the trial court provided a detailed explanation of its\ndetermination that resentencing defendant as a second strike offender would create an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Under the deferential abuse of discretion\nstandard of review, that ruling will be upheld on appeal unless it “‘falls outside the\nbounds of reason’ under the applicable law and the relevant facts [citations].” (People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 162.) We find no abuse of discretion in this case.\n       Given the length of time already served by defendant, the granting of his petition\nfor resentencing would render him eligible for immediate release. Defendant argues the\ndenial of his petition is akin to the denial of parole, which would be reviewed under the\n“some evidence” standard of review. In the parole suitability context, “a court must\nconsider whether ‘some evidence in the record before the Board supports the decision to\ndeny parole, based upon the factors specified by statute and regulation.” (In re Lawrence\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1210.) Under the deferential “some evidence” standard of\n\n\n       5 Whether the abuse of discretion standard of review applies to resentencing\npetition orders is an issue now pending before the Supreme Court in People v. Aparicio\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rules of Court.\n                                             11\n\freview, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the parole board, and the\nstandard of review “‘simply ensures that parole decisions are supported by a modicum of\nevidence and are not arbitrary and capricious.’ [Citation.]” (In re Bettencourt, supra,\n156 Cal.App.4th at p. 798.) Given the numerous findings of misconduct in defendant’s\nprison file, many of which involved violence and included a finding of battery against a\nprison guard, we conclude the trial court’s ruling is supported by more than some\nevidence.\n       Defendant’s assertion that he falls outside the “spirit” of the Three Strikes law is\nnot compelling. The trial court denied defendant’s Romero motion, thus finding him\nwithin the spirit of that law.\n       C.     Propositions 36 and 47\n       Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, was enacted while this\nappeal was pending. Under Proposition 47, certain drug- and theft-related offenses were\ndesignated as misdemeanors; previously the same offenses were punishable as felonies or\nmisdemeanors depending on the underlying facts. (People v. Rivera (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1091 [Rivera].) Proposition 47 allows an inmate to petition for\nresentencing if he or she is currently serving a felony sentence for a crime Proposition 47\nnow designates as a misdemeanor. (§1170.18, subd. (a); Rivera, at p. 1092.)\n       If the petitioner meets the criteria for resentencing, his or her “felony sentence\nshall be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in\nits discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b); see Rivera, at p. 1092.) The standard\nused in Proposition 36 for determining whether a person should be resentenced is also\nused in Proposition 47. The identical three factors are to be considered in making the\ndetermination under both statutes. (Compare § 1170.18, subd. (b) with § 1170.126,\nsubd. (g).)\n       Section 1170.18, subdivision (c) states, “As used throughout this Code,\n‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\n\n                                             12\n\fsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (c), italics added.) The phrase, a “new violent felony,” refers to the same felonies\nthat disqualify an inmate from resentencing under Proposition 36. (Compare § 1170.18,\nsubd. (c) with § 1170.126, subd. (e)(3).)\n       Defendant contends that Proposition 47’s definition of the phrase, “unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety,” applies retroactively to resentencing petitions under\nProposition 36. That issue also is pending before the Supreme Court. (People v. Chaney\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Other courts have reached the same\ndecision, and the issue is pending before the Supreme Court. (People v. Guzman (2015)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rules of\nCourt.)\n       The Sixth District recently held that section 1170.18 subdivision (c)’s definition\ncontains an obvious drafting error. (People v. Lopez (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Lopez).) The court examined the statutory definition and concluded “that the word\n‘Code’ was ‘erroneously used’ in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) rather than the word\n‘Act,’ to refer to the SNS [Safe Neighborhoods and Schools] Act, and therefore this error\nis properly subjected to ‘judicial correction.’ The ‘purpose’ of section 1170.18 and ‘the\nintent of the electorate’ in enacting it unambiguously demonstrate that the voters did not\nintend to alter the Reform Act or section 1170.126 in any way or to require the\nresentencing of any person serving a sentence for a crime other than one of the specified\nnonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes.” (Id. at p. 527.)\n       Lopez identified three grounds in support of its determination.\n       “First, because Proposition 47’s ballot materials and proposed statutory language\ncontained nothing whatsoever to suggest that Proposition 47 would have any impact on\n\n                                             13\n\fthe resentencing of anyone who was serving a sentence for a crime other than one of the\nspecified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes, it is inconceivable that voters\nintended for subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 to severely restrict the ability of a court to\nreject a resentencing petition under the Reform Act by a person convicted of crimes other\nthan one of the specified property or drug crimes and whom the court considered\ndangerous. The Proposition 47 ballot materials contained no mention of such a possible\nconsequence and the only hint was the use of the word ‘Code’ rather than ‘Act’ in an\nobscure subdivision of the lengthy proposed act. The ballot materials repeatedly\nemphasized that the resentencing provisions of Proposition 47, which were contained in\nsection 1170.18, were limited to only those persons serving sentences for the specified\nnonserious, nonviolent property or drug crimes.\n       “Second, the timing of Proposition 47 makes an intent to alter the Reform Act\nillogical. The Reform Act required petitions to be brought within two years unless a\ncourt concluded that there was good cause for a late-filed petition. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (b).) By the time Proposition 47 took effect, only two days remained in the two-\nyear period for filing a Reform Act petition. No rational voter could have intended to\nchange the rules for Reform Act petitions at the last moment, when nearly all petitions\nwould already have been filed and most of them adjudicated.\n       “Third, the structure and content of section 1170.18 is inconsistent with an intent\nto apply section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s definition throughout the entire Penal Code.\nSubdivision (n) of section 1170.18 provides: ‘Nothing in this and related sections is\nintended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within\nthe purview of this act.’ (§ 1170.18, subd. (n), italics added.) Applying section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition throughout the Penal Code would necessarily ‘diminish or\nabrogate the finality of judgments’ in cases, like those subject to the Reform Act, that do\nnot fall ‘within the purview of’ Proposition 47. Defendant’s petition under the Reform\nAct, like most such petitions, seeks to abrogate the finality of a Three Strikes judgment in\na case that does not involve one of the specified nonserious, nonviolent property or drug\ncrimes. Thus, under section 1170.18, subdivision (n), ‘[n]othing’ in section 1170.18 was\n\n                                              14\n\fintended to apply to his petition. In addition, the wording of section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) is itself inconsistent with an intent to apply it ‘throughout’ the entire Penal\nCode. It refers to ‘petitioners’ and defines a phrase that appears in only two sections of\nthe Penal Code, section 1170.18 and section 1170.126. If the voters had intended to\napply this definition to Reform Act petitions, this phrasing would have been the most\nroundabout means of doing so. Since the ballot materials made no mention of the\nReform Act, we will not ascribe such unreasonable conduct to the voters.” (People v.\nLopez, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at pp. 527–528.)\n        We agree with this analysis and similarly conclude that Proposition 47’s definition\nof the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” does not apply retroactively\nto resentencing under Proposition 36. We therefore reject the contention that Proposition\n47’s definition of the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” applies to this\ncase.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n        The order is affirmed.\n        NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n\n\n\n                                                   EPSTEIN, P.
