Brown; and Compton’s supervisor, Emily King.\n\nBy four appellate issues, Compton argues that: (1) the trial court erred in granting\n\nthe District’s plea to the jurisdiction for failure to state a viable claim, (2) the\n\ninjunction sought by Compton was not moot, (3) Brown and King were not entitled\n\n                                         1\n\fto immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, and (4) the District Court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Brown and King was improper. We overrule Compton’s issues and\n\naffirm the trial court’s orders dismissing her claims and awarding attorney’s fees.\n\n                                  I. Background\n\n      In this suit, Compton complains that the Defendants violated her right to free\n\nspeech. Compton began working as a Speech Language Pathologist for the District\n\nin August, 2009. In that capacity, she provided speech therapy to students at three\n\ncampuses within the school district. At some point during her first year of\n\nemployment with the District, Compton complained to her supervisors, King and\n\nSharon Boutte1, that student reports she printed from one school were being routed\n\nto a printer that was located in a public hallway at another school and that she\n\nbelieved such open access to the reports to be a problem with regard to federal\n\nstudent privacy rights. Compton alleges that after she made this complaint and\n\nattempted to have the printer set-up corrected through the District’s IT department,\n\nKing created a hostile work environment by giving Compton an “exhausting and\n\n\n      1\n        Compton named Sharon Boutte as a defendant in her original pleadings, but\nomitted Boutte as a party in her amended petition. Boutte filed a plea to the\njurisdiction jointly with Brown, King, and the District, and the trial court’s order\ngranting the plea to the jurisdiction dismissed Compton’s claims against Boutte with\nprejudice. On appeal, Compton does not challenge the dismissal of her claims\nagainst Boutte. On December 8, 2015, Compton notified this Court that Boutte was\ndropped as a party.\n                                           2\n\frigorous schedule of meetings” in late Fall 2010, and then initiating an investigation\n\nagainst Compton based on “false accusations of Medicaid fraud.”\n\n      The fraud investigation concerned Compton’s documentation of services\n\ndelivered to students. One of Compton’s duties as a speech therapist was to\n\naccurately record and report the services she provided to each student so that the\n\nDistrict could be reimbursed by Medicaid. Due to discrepancies in Compton’s\n\ndocumentation regarding the dates and times of services rendered to particular\n\nstudents, the District was never able to submit any of Compton’s paperwork to the\n\nfederal government for reimbursement. In October 2010, the District commenced an\n\ninvestigation into the documentation anomalies, and Compton was placed on\n\nadministrative leave while the investigation was pending. Following the\n\ninvestigation, Compton requested, and was granted, a reassignment as a content\n\nmastery teacher.2\n\n      After being granted her reassignment to the teaching position, Compton filed\n\nthis suit seeking a declaratory judgment that her constitutional right of free speech\n\nhad been violated and an injunction against future violations, as well as costs and\n\nattorney’s fees. Brown, King, Boutte, and the District all responded to the suit by\n\n\n      2\n        The record before this court is unclear as to the timeline between the\nconclusion of the investigation and Compton’s commencement of her reassigned\nposition; however, the precise timeline is not relevant to the dispositive issues herein.\n                                           3\n\ffiling a plea to the jurisdiction with their original answer, followed by a separate\n\nPlea to the Jurisdiction, or, Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the trial\n\ncourt did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. Specifically, Brown, King,\n\nand Boutte sought dismissal based on the professional immunity provided in section\n\n22.0511 of the Texas Education Code, as well as under the election of remedies\n\ndoctrine of the Texas Tort Claims Act (“TTCA”). See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §\n\n22.0511(a) (West 2012); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.106 (West 2011). The\n\nDistrict sought dismissal based on governmental immunity, asserting that\n\nCompton’s claims did not fall within any waiver of that immunity. The District\n\nsubsequently supplemented its plea to assert that Compton’s claims were moot in\n\nlight of her having transferred at her own request. The District then supplemented\n\nits plea a second time to expand on its claim that official and governmental immunity\n\ndeprived the court of subject-matter jurisdiction over Compton’s claims because\n\nCompton had failed to allege sufficient facts in her pleadings to demonstrate that she\n\nhad any facially valid constitutional claims against the District or its employees.\n\n      The trial court conducted a non-evidentiary hearing on the defendants’ various\n\njurisdictional challenges. Following the hearing, on April 23, 2015, the trial court\n\nentered an order dismissing Compton’s claims against Brown, Boutte, and King, and\n\ndismissed those individual defendants with prejudice. The court’s order did not\n\n                                          4\n\fspecify the grounds upon which the dismissal was granted, although it did\n\nacknowledge the matter considered was both a Plea to the Jurisdiction and Motion\n\nto Dismiss filed pursuant to section 22.051 of the Texas Education Code and section\n\n101.106 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code. Shortly thereafter, on April 29,\n\n2015, the trial court entered a second order, this one granting the District’s plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction. In its order dismissing Compton’s claims against the District, the\n\ncourt found that Compton “failed to state a viable claim under the free expression\n\nclause which protects public employees engaging in free speech of public concern.”\n\n      Compton filed a Motion for New Trial as to both orders, and Brown, Boutte,\n\nand King filed an application for attorney’s fees pursuant to section 22.0511 of the\n\nTexas Education Code. The trial court held a hearing on Compton’s motion and the\n\nindividual defendants’ application. Following the hearing, the trial court issued a\n\nletter to all counsel setting forth its findings and opinions on the issues presented and\n\nadvising of its intended rulings. In its letter, dated June 24, 2015, the court elaborated\n\non its specific findings that Compton’s speech was not protected because it was\n\nmade pursuant to official duties and because it was made in a private context\n\nbetween employer and employee; therefore, Compton had failed to plead a proper\n\nconstitutional violation, rendering the granting of the District’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction appropriate. The court further found that dismissal for lack of\n\n                                            5\n\fjurisdiction was appropriate because Compton’s requested and granted transfer\n\nwithout any allegation of subsequent retaliation either deprived the case of a\n\njusticiable issue or rendered the issue moot.3\n\n       The letter also addressed the application of the individual defendants for\n\nattorney’s fees, finding that all actions taken by Brown, Boutte, and King were “in\n\nfact, within the scope of and/or incident to their duties,” which entitled them to\n\nrecovery of their collective attorney’s fees.\n\n       Finally, with regard to the dismissal of the individual defendants, the court\n\nnoted that section 22.0511 of the Texas Educational Code provided the individuals\n\nimmunity from liability, but “does not, however, provide immunity from suit, and\n\ntherefore, is not a proper basis for a Plea to the Jurisdiction.” The letter indicates that\n\nthe order dismissing the individual defendants “should be vacated”; however, no\n\norder was ever entered vacating the dismissal order. To the contrary, on July 1, 2015,\n\nthe trial court explicitly “affirm[ed] its [o]rders dismissing Plaintiff’s claims against\n\n[the District and the individual defendants] with prejudice” in a written order\n\ndenying Compton’s motion for new trial. That order also awarded attorney’s fees to\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        The trial court’s finding that Compton failed to plead a proper constitutional\nviolation, as well as its findings regarding justiciability and mootness, do not refer\nspecifically or exclusively to the District, but rather to “the defendants” collectively.\n                                            6\n\fBrown and King, jointly and severally. Compton filed a timely notice of appeal from\n\nthe orders dismissing her claims.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\n      Compton’s first two issues on appeal challenge the trial court’s dismissal of\n\nher claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; her third issue challenges the\n\ndismissal of Brown and King, arguing that those individuals were not entitled to\n\nprofessional immunity. Compton’s fourth issue challenges the court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Brown and King.\n\nA. Dismissal of Compton’s Claims Against the District\n\n      In filing its pleas to the jurisdiction, the District challenged the trial court’s\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the claims in Compton’s pleadings, asserting that\n\nthe District was protected from suit by governmental immunity. The doctrine of\n\ngovernmental immunity from suit operates like sovereign immunity to defeat a trial\n\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction over a claim against a political subdivision, like a\n\nschool district, unless the state has expressly consented to suit. Harris County v.\n\nSykes, 136 S.W.3d 635, 638 (Tex. 2004). As such, governmental immunity may be\n\nproperly raised in a plea to the jurisdiction. Id. Whether a trial court has subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction over a claim is a question of law, which we review on appeal de\n\nnovo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004).\n\n                                           7\n\fThe plaintiff bears the burden of pleading sufficient facts to affirmatively show that\n\nthe trial court has jurisdiction to hear the cause. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control\n\nBd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993). When, as is the case here, a plea to the\n\njurisdiction challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s pleadings to establish a\n\nwaiver of governmental immunity, and thereby establish jurisdiction, we must\n\ndetermine whether the plaintiff has pled a facially valid constitutional claim. See\n\nKlumb v. Houston Mun. Emps. Pension Sys., 458 S.W.3d 1, 13 (Tex. 2015) (citing\n\nCity of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex. 2009)); City of Houston v.\n\nJohnson, 353 S.W.3d 499, 504 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied).\n\nIn doing so, we construe the pleadings liberally in the plaintiff’s favor and look to\n\nher intent. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. If the pleadings fail to allege sufficient facts\n\nto demonstrate jurisdiction, but the deficiency is curable, the plaintiff “should be\n\nafforded the opportunity to amend.” Id. at 226–27. If, on the other hand, “the\n\npleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction, then a plea to the\n\njurisdiction may be granted without allowing the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend.”\n\nId. at 227.\n\n      1. Failure to State a Claim\n\n      Compton argues that the trial court’s grant of the District’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction for failure to state a claim was improper because Compton’s speech was,\n\n                                            8\n\fas a matter of law, protected under the Texas Constitution. Although Compton\n\nargues that the protections afforded to her under article I, section 8 of the Texas\n\nConstitution are greater than those of the freedom of speech clause in the First\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution, we note that Texas courts have\n\ngenerally refused to hold that the Texas Constitution’s free-speech clause affords a\n\nplaintiff greater rights than does the First Amendment except in terms of prior\n\nrestraint. See generally Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Barber, 111 S.W.3d 86, 106 (Tex.\n\n2003) (quoting Operation Rescue–Nat’l v. Planned Parenthood of Houston & Se.\n\nTex., Inc., 975 S.W.2d 546, 557–60 (Tex. 1998)). Recognizing this authority,\n\nCompton attempts to distinguish her case from Barber with a “historical and textual\n\nbasis for a more expansive reading of [a]rticle 1, [s]ection 8 of the Texas\n\nConstitution”; however, in doing so, she fails to cite any authority supporting that\n\nthe elements of a free-speech claim under the Texas Constitution are different than\n\nthe elements that must be pled under a First Amendment claim, in the context of\n\nprior restraint or otherwise, nor does she demonstrate how such differences “are\n\nmaterial to [her] case.” See Bentley v. Bunton, 94 S.W.3d 561, 579 (Tex. 2002); see\n\nalso Operation Rescue, 975 S.W.2d at 559 (noting that “[t]he text, history, and\n\npurposes of [a]rticle 1, [s]ection 8 have been thoroughly examined by [the Texas\n\nSupreme Court]” and finding, even in cases of prior restraint, nothing to suggest that\n\n                                          9\n\finjunctions restricting speech should be judged “by a different standard under the\n\nstate constitution than the First Amendment”); Ex parte Tucci, 859 S.W.2d 1, 32\n\n(Tex. 1993) (Phillips, C.J., concurring) (articulating that “nothing in the language or\n\npurpose of the Texas Free Expression Clause authorizes us . . . to abandon the notion\n\nof accommodating competing interests . . . or even to afford greater weight in the\n\nbalancing of interests to free expression than we would under the First Amendment\n\n. . . .”). Accordingly, we apply federal cases when analyzing Compton’s claim, and\n\nfind that Compton’s pleadings fail to allege sufficient facts to show that her speech\n\nwas protected under either article I, section 8 of the Texas Constitution or under the\n\nFreedom of Speech Clause in the First Amendment. U.S. CONST. amend. I; Tex.\n\nConst. art. I, § 8.\n\n       In order to plead a facially valid claim that her free speech rights were\n\nviolated, Compton was required to allege facts that, if true, would show that: (1)\n\nCompton’s “speech involved a matter of public concern”; (2) her interest in speaking\n\non such matters outweighed the District’s interest in promoting efficiency; and (3)\n\nher speech was the motivating factor in an adverse employment action taken against\n\nher. Thompson v. City of Starkville, Miss., 901 F.2d 456, 460 (5th Cir. 1990) (quoting\n\nFrazier v. King, 873 F.2d 820, 825 (5th Cir. 1989)). As the trial court based its\n\ndismissal of Compton’s claims against the District on an express finding that\n\n                                          10\n\fCompton’s speech was not a matter of “public concern,” we address only that\n\nelement of the claim.\n\n      As a general matter, speech made pursuant to a speaker’s official duties is not\n\nconstitutionally protected because “[r]estricting speech that owes its existence to a\n\npublic employee’s professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the\n\nemployee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.” Turner v. Perry, 278 S.W.3d\n\n806, 816 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (quoting Garcetti v.\n\nCeballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421–22 (2006)). Further, even where the content or subject\n\nmatter of speech may implicate some degree of public concern, the form and context\n\nof a given statement must also be evaluated in the context of the whole record. See\n\nid.; Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147–48, (1983). Speech that is made privately\n\nbetween the speaker and her employer or its employees, rather than “against the\n\nbackdrop of public debate” is generally not deemed of “public concern.” See, e.g.,\n\nBradshaw v. Pittsburg Indep. Sch. Dist., 207 F.3d 814, 817–18 (5th Cir. 2000)\n\n(holding that the fact that the plaintiff outlined concerns in internal grievances rather\n\nthan in any public announcement weighed in favor of finding that her speech was\n\nnot public in nature); Teague v. City of Flower Mound, Tex., 179 F.3d 377, 383 (5th\n\nCir. 1999) (holding that, although police misconduct is generally an issue of public\n\nconcern, the fact that plaintiff’s speech was made privately by way of internal\n\n                                           11\n\fgrievance rather than in a publicized dispute lent to the conclusion that the speech\n\nwas “of private concern” and not protected); Price v. Tex. Alcoholic Beverage\n\nComm’n, No. 01-12-01164-CV, 2014 WL 3408696, at *8 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] July 10, 2014, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (finding that speech communicated\n\nonly to a superior and in the context of an employment dispute was not of public\n\nconcern); cf. Markos v. City of Atlanta, Tex., 364 F.3d 567, 571 (5th Cir. 2004)\n\n(holding that speech made to a newspaper reporter with clear understanding it would\n\nbe published was of public form, and noting “the importance of the form in\n\nascertaining whether speech is of public concern.”).\n\n      In this case, the record indicates that the speech upon which Compton’s claim\n\nis based concerned a single complaint: that when she attempted to print student\n\nreports from one school, her assigned printer resulted in the documents actually\n\nprinting to a copier in an open hallway at another school, and that the disclosure of\n\nthe information in the reports could violate student privacy rights. Thus, the true\n\ncontent of her speech was a complaint that the way the District’s printers were\n\ninstalled could result in Compton herself disclosing private student information if\n\nshe printed her Medicaid reports to a particular location without having another\n\nemployee there to retrieve them, and a request that the District’s IT personnel install\n\nthe printers differently. Such matters directly concerned Compton’s official duties\n\n                                          12\n\fin creating and submitting reports, and the way printers were installed by the\n\norganization that employed her. See Turner, 278 S.W.3d at 816. Moreover, her\n\npleadings do not allege, nor does the record as a whole reveal, that she ever spoke\n\nof this matter to anyone other than Boutte, King, and the District’s IT personnel. As\n\na result, her pleadings do not allege sufficient facts to show that she had engaged in\n\nany constitutionally protected speech regarding matters of “public concern.” See id.;\n\nTeague, 179 F.3d at 383. Moreover, Compton has not requested an opportunity to\n\nplead additional facts to demonstrate jurisdiction. Accordingly, based on the record\n\nthat was before the trial court, we hold that the court did not err in finding that\n\nCompton failed to plead a facially valid constitutional claim against the District.\n\n      Compton also complains on appeal that the only proper mechanism for the\n\nDistrict to seek dismissal of her claims for failure to plead a facially valid\n\nconstitutional claim would have been a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 91a of\n\nthe Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which Compton asserts that the District did not\n\ntimely file. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a. Although Compton is correct that the District\n\ncould have sought dismissal with such a motion, “Rule 91a is not the exclusive\n\nmeans that a defendant may use to test the validity of a plaintiff’s pleadings.”\n\nJackson v. Port Arthur Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 09-15-00227-CV, 2017 WL 1425589,\n\nat *5 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Apr. 20, 2017, no pet.) (mem. op.). A plea to the\n\n                                         13\n\fjurisdiction is also a proper way to challenge the facial validity of a constitutional\n\nclaim against a political subdivision. See, e.g., Johnson, 353 S.W.3d at 502.\n\nAccordingly, we find Compton’s argument regarding Rule 91a to be without merit.\n\n      Finally, in her reply brief, Compton argues that the trial court had jurisdiction\n\nover her claims because the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”) permits\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees even by a non-prevailing party. Although Compton’s first\n\namended petition—her live pleading at the time of dismissal—does not allege any\n\nlegal basis for recovery of attorney’s fees, her reply brief indicates that the claim is\n\nmade pursuant to section 37.009 of the DJA. The Texas Supreme Court has held that\n\nthe DJA waives governmental immunity from suit for a claim for attorney’s fees\n\nunder section 37.009 when the claim for attorney’s fees is made in connection with\n\na claim for declaratory relief that falls within the limited waiver of immunity\n\ncontained in section 37.006(b) of the DJA. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann.\n\n§§ 37.006(b), 37.009 (West 2015); Tex. Educ. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432,\n\n446 (Tex. 1994). However, Compton’s request for declaratory judgment does not\n\nfall within section 37.006(b)’s limited waiver of immunity because nothing in her\n\nclaims challenges the validity of an ordinance, statute, or franchise. See Tex. Dep’t\n\nof Transp. v. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d 618, 622 (Tex. 2011). Therefore, the DJA does not\n\nwaive the District’s governmental immunity from suit for Compton’s claim for\n\n                                          14\n\fdeclaratory relief, nor for her request for attorney’s fees. See id.; Montrose Mgmt.\n\nDist. v. 1620 Hawthorne, Ltd., 435 S.W.3d 393, 403–04 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2014, pet. denied).\n\n       2. Failure to Plead a Justiciable Claim\n\n       In her second issue, Compton argues that her request for injunctive relief was\n\nnot moot because if she were ever to return to work as a speech language pathologist\n\nfor the District, she would work under King again, at which point King “would\n\nimmediately return to harassing her.” She also argues that “mootness depends upon\n\nevidence and proof which may only surface outside the pleadings by the court’s\n\nexercise of jurisdictional authority,” although she cites no legal authority in support\n\nof this assertion.\n\n       Issues of justiciability, including mootness and standing, are all threshold\n\nissues that implicate subject matter jurisdiction. See Heckman v. Williamson Cty.,\n\n369 S.W.3d 137, 162 (Tex. 2012); Labrado v. Cty. of El Paso, 132 S.W.3d 581, 589\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2004, no pet.). Justiciability, which is a component of standing,\n\nrequires the existence of a live “controversy between the parties that will be actually\n\nresolved by the judicial relief sought.” State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243,\n\n245 (Tex. 1994); see also Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex.\n\n1995) (holding that “[t]o constitute a justiciable controversy, there must exist a real\n\n                                          15\n\fand substantial controversy involving genuine conflict of tangible interests and not\n\nmerely a theoretical dispute.” (quoting Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Ctys. Water Control\n\n& Improvement Dist. No. 1 v. Medina Lake Prot. Ass’n, 640 S.W.2d 778, 779–80\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 1982, writ ref’d n.r.e.)) Because mootness or the lack of\n\na justiciable controversy deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, which is\n\n“essential to a court’s authority to dispose of cases,” it may be raised by any party,\n\nor the court sua sponte, at any time. City of El Paso v. Waterblasting Techs., Inc.,\n\n491 S.W.3d 890, 904 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2016, no pet.).\n\n      Compton argues that she is entitled to injunctive relief on the basis that she\n\n“wants to become a speech language pathologist again” but would potentially face\n\nharassment from King in the event that she ever returns to work as a speech therapist\n\nfor the District in the future. Such a claim is insufficient to constitute a live\n\ncontroversy. Compton did not plead for reinstatement of her old position as a speech\n\ntherapist in the trial court, nor has she alleged, either in the trial court or on appeal,\n\nthat she has any legal or contractual right to return to that position. Without pleadings\n\nalleging an actual, continuing present injury, or even a reasonable expectation or\n\nlikelihood that Compton will work as a speech therapist for the District again, any\n\nrequest for injunctive relief would be merely hypothetical, rendering judicial action\n\nan impermissible advisory opinion. See Robinson v. Alief Indep. Sch. Dist., 298\n\n                                           16\n\fS.W.3d 321, 326 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied); see also Pate\n\nv. Edwards, No. 12-13-00231-CV, 2014 WL 172509, *2 (Tex. App.—Tyler Jan.\n\n15, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.) (plaintiff’s assertion that she could return to work for\n\nthe school district after her resignation presented a “hypothetical or contingent\n\ncontroversy” over which a court, even as part of a declaratory judgment action, has\n\nno authority to resolve); Scurlock Permian Corp. v. Brazos Cty., 869 S.W.2d 478,\n\n487 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied) (“Courts may not give\n\nadvisory opinions or decide cases upon speculative, hypothetical, or contingent\n\nsituations.”).\n\n       Compton’s request for declaratory relief likewise presents a nonjusticiable\n\nclaim because her pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of continuing harm,\n\nand thus a live controversy. “Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself\n\namount to a present controversy for declaratory relief if unaccompanied by any\n\ncontinuing, present, adverse effects.” Robinson, 298 S.W.3d at 327; see also\n\nWilliams v. Lara, 52 S.W.3d 171, 184 (Tex. 2001) (holding that a claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief is moot if the party is no longer subjected to the alleged\n\nunconstitutional activity for which he seeks declaratory relief).\n\n       Further, we disagree with Compton’s complaint that mootness cannot be\n\nestablished based on the record before the trial court. In pertinent part, Compton’s\n\n                                         17\n\fpleadings and argument establish that she requested and received a reassignment\n\naway from King prior to filing this action, and that after the transfer, it was\n\n“impossible for Defendants’ [sic] to continue their harassment of her because she is\n\nno longer working with them.” The trial court, acknowledging these undisputed\n\nfacts, stated in its June 24 letter to counsel that “[r]egardless of whether this would\n\nbe considered as depriving the case of a justiciable issue or rendering the issue moot,\n\ndismissal for lack of jurisdiction is warranted.”4 The record, both before the trial\n\ncourt and in Compton’s own argument on appeal, affirmatively negates any need for\n\nadditional evidence or proof, as it is undisputed that Compton was no longer being\n\nsubjected to any alleged harassment before she filed suit.\n\n      Compton also argues for the first time in her reply brief that her claim for\n\nattorney’s fees under the DJA remains a live controversy even if the mootness\n\ndoctrine prevents her from prevailing on her request for substantive relief. Even if\n\nCompton had presented this argument in her opening brief, it would not have\n\n\n\n      4\n         Neither the trial court’s order granting the plea to the jurisdiction nor the\norder denying a new trial and affirming the dismissal of all parties address the issue\nof mootness; however, the trial court’s letter ruling explicitly identified mootness or\nthe absence of a justiciable issue as a basis supporting dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction, and both parties have, in their respective briefs, treated the letter ruling\nas providing a basis of the court’s dismissal of all claims. Accordingly, we treat the\ntrial court’s letter rulings as competent evidence of the trial court’s basis for\ndismissing the claims.\n                                           18\n\fsupported reversal, as Compton’s case is fundamentally distinguishable from each\n\nof the cases upon which she relies in support of her argument. Specifically,\n\nCompton’s claim that her request for attorney’s fees remains a “live controversy”\n\ndespite the mootness of her substantive claims ignores the subtle distinction between\n\na case that lacked justiciability from the moment of pleading and a case wherein\n\nsome event “extinguished what was initially a live controversy, a justiciable case\n\nbetween proper parties.” See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 865\n\n(Tex. 2010). In each of the cases cited by Compton in support of her argument, there\n\nexisted a justiciable claim at the time of filing that was subsequently rendered moot\n\nby the occurrence of one or more intervening events during the pendency of\n\nlitigation. See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hallman, 159 S.W.3d 640, 642–43 (Tex. 2005)\n\n(cross-claims brought between an insurance company and its insured under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act for determination of rights under insurance policy were\n\nlive controversies at the time of filing, rendered moot after the underlying litigation\n\nby the insurance company’s ultimate provision of the requested defense); Camarena\n\nv. Tex. Emp’t Comm’n, 754 S.W.2d 149, 151–52 (Tex. 1988) (farm workers’\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act’s\n\nagricultural exemption was rendered moot by Legislature’s amendment of the Act\n\nafter injunctive and declaratory relief had been granted by the trial court); Ward v.\n\n                                          19\n\fLamar Univ., 484 S.W.3d 440, 450 (Tex. App.— Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, no\n\npet.) (employee resigned her position after the trial court dismissed her claims but\n\nbefore any party filed a brief on appeal); Pate, 2014 WL 172509, at *2 (employee\n\nvoluntarily resigned to pursue other employment opportunities three months after\n\nthe trial court entered a temporary restraining order in employee’s favor); see also\n\nHansen v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 774–75 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2011, no pet.) (“[A] case under the Declaratory Judgments Act remains a live\n\ncontroversy, even if all requests for substantive declaratory relief become moot\n\nduring the action’s pendency, as long as a claim for attorneys’ fees under the Act\n\nremains pending.”) (emphasis added). Compton has cited no authority, and we have\n\nlikewise found no authority, for the proposition that a claimant can seek attorney’s\n\nfees on a claim for which there was no justiciable issue, and therefore no standing,\n\nat the time the suit was filed.5 We therefore reject Compton’s argument that her own\n\n\n\n      5\n         We recognize that in Devon Energy Prod. Co. v. KCS Res., LLC, our sister\ncourt has rejected the argument that mootness ab initio, as distinguished from\nintervening mootness, deprives a trial court of jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees\nunder the DJA. 450 S.W.3d 203, 220–23 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014,\npet. denied). We find Devon Energy to be distinguishable because that case affirmed\nthe trial court’s jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees to the party defending against a\ndeclaratory judgment action over which the trial court had determined that it lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claim. Id. at 220. We decline to extend\nthat court’s reasoning to allow a claimant to continue to pursue her own attorney’s\nfees when she lacked standing at the outset to seek the underlying substantive relief.\n                                            20\n\frequest for attorney’s fees under the DJA can “revive” a claim that was not a live\n\ncontroversy at its legal inception.\n\nB. Dismissal of Compton’s Claims Against the Individual Defendants\n\n      In her third issue, Compton challenges the trial court’s dismissal of her claims\n\nagainst Brown and King, individually. Specifically, Compton argues that Brown and\n\nKing were not entitled to immunity or dismissal under the TTCA because they were\n\neach acting ultra vires, outside the scope of their legitimate duties, and because she\n\nsought only declaratory and injunctive relief on constitutional grounds, rather than\n\ndamages for tort. However, we need not address the merits of Compton’s claims,\n\nnor the applicability of the election of remedies doctrine in light of the trial court’s\n\nfactual finding that King and Brown were acting “within the scope of and/or incident\n\nto their duties,” because we find that Compton’s ultra vires claims against the\n\nindividual defendants suffer from the same dispositive absence of a justiciable issue\n\nas her claims against the District, depriving the trial court of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n      Although the trial court did state in its letter to counsel that dismissal of\n\nCompton’s claims for lack of jurisdiction was warranted for mootness or lack of a\n\njusticiable issue, none of the orders that were entered by the court dismissing the\n\nclaims against the individual defendants specifically articulated the absence of a\n\n                                          21\n\fjusticiable issue as the actual basis for dismissal, referencing instead only section\n\n22.0511 of the Texas Education Code and section 101.106 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code. Nevertheless, as the existence of justiciable claim is\n\na threshold component of subject matter jurisdiction, we consider Compton’s\n\nstanding sua sponte as a ground upon which to affirm the trial court’s finding that it\n\nlacked jurisdiction over Compton’s claims. See Tex. Workers’ Comp. Comm’n v.\n\nGarcia, 893 S.W.2d 504, 517 n.15 (Tex. 1995); Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at\n\n446. As we have already set forth in response to Compton’s second issue above,\n\neven construed liberally and in her favor, Compton’s pleadings not only fail to\n\nallege, but rather affirmatively negate, the existence of any justiciable controversy\n\nagainst the District or the individual defendants. Accordingly, the trial court’s\n\ndismissal of Compton’s claims against Brown and King for lack of jurisdiction was\n\nproper. See Robinson, 298 S.W.3d at 327; Pate, 2014 WL 172509, at *2; Williams,\n\n52 S.W.3d at 184.\n\nC. Award of Attorney’s Fees to Individual Defendants\n\n      In her final point of error, Compton asserts that the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Brown and King should be reversed because the description of the\n\nrendered legal services provided in their claim for fees did not specify which services\n\nbilled were for whom among Brown, King, and Boutte, individually.\n                                          22\n\f      We review de novo both the availability of attorney’s fees under a particular\n\nstatute and the need to segregate attorney’s fees, as such issues are questions of law.\n\nJakab v. Gran Villa Townhouses Homeowners Ass’n, Inc., 149 S.W.3d 863, 867\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.) (discussing whether attorney’s fees are available\n\nunder a particular statute is reviewed de novo); Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa,\n\n212 S.W.3d 299, 312–13 (Tex. 2006) (the need to segregate fees is a question of\n\nlaw). However, the extent to which attorney’s fees “can or cannot be segregated is a\n\nmixed question of law and fact.” CA Partners v. Spears, 274 S.W.3d 51, 81 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). On review of such mixed questions,\n\nwe “defer to the trial court’s factual determinations if supported by the evidence but\n\nreview its legal determinations de novo.” Titan Transp., LP v. Combs, 433 S.W.3d\n\n625, 636 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, pet. denied).\n\n      The application for attorney’s fees at issue was filed jointly by Brown, King,\n\nand Boutte. The record does not contain a written response by Compton to the\n\nrequest; however, the record does indicate that a hearing was held on the matter, at\n\nwhich time Compton argued that attorney’s fees were not available to the defendants\n\nbecause Compton had not pled a tort cause of action against them, and that attorney’s\n\nfees for Boutte were inappropriate because she was only named in the style, and\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fnever listed as a defendant or served with process. After the hearing, the trial court\n\nawarded attorney’s fees to Brown and King, jointly and severally.\n\n      The individual defendants’ application for attorney’s fees did not segregate\n\nfees by party, nor did the trial court’s order award fees by party; rather, the court\n\nfound that “[t]he matters identified would have been necessary for any and all\n\ndefendants with the same amount of time having been expended.” On appeal,\n\nCompton acknowledges the trial court’s finding in this regard, yet offers no authority\n\nto support her contention that fees must nonetheless have been segregated among\n\nthe individual defendants. A review of the record on appeal supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding regarding the nature of the claimed fees, as all fees awarded were for work\n\ndone on behalf of all of the individual defendants collectively, asserting the same\n\ndefenses and arguments to a singular set of facts, almost none of which involved\n\nBoutte individually and distinct from King and Brown. Accordingly, we find that\n\nthere is evidence to support the court’s factual determination that attorney’s fees\n\ncould not be segregated.\n\n      Compton next argues that the trial court should not have awarded fees under\n\nthe Texas Education Code because her case was not actually dismissed based on the\n\nprofessional immunity provision contained in section 25.0511. Compton cites no\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fauthority in support of such a prerequisite, nor can one be found in either section\n\n22.0517 or 22.0511 of the Texas Education Code. Section 22.0517 provides:\n\n      In an action against a professional employee of a school district\n      involving an act that is incidental to or within the scope of duties of the\n      employee’s position of employment and brought against the employee\n      in the employee’s individual capacity, the employee is entitled to\n      recover attorney’s fees and court costs from the plaintiff if the employee\n      is found immune from liability under this subchapter.\n\nTex. Educ. Code Ann. § 22.0517 (West 2012). In turn, Section 22.0511, which\n\nestablishes “immunity” for the purposes of Chapter 22, provides:\n\n      A professional employee of a school district is not personally liable for\n      any act that is incident to or within the scope of the duties of the\n      employee’s position of employment and that involves the exercise of\n      judgment or discretion on the part of the employee, except in\n      circumstances in which a professional employee uses excessive force\n      in the discipline of students or negligence resulting in bodily injury to\n      students.\n\nId. § 22.0511(a). Nothing in section 22.0517 makes dismissal based on 22.0511 a\n\nprerequisite to recovery of attorney’s fees; rather, read together, these provisions\n\nrequire only a finding or determination that a defendant is immune from liability as\n\na professional employee in order to be entitled to receive fees. See Ward v. Theret,\n\n346 S.W.3d 672, 675–76 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 2009, no pet.). Although\n\nCompton argues that King is not entitled to immunity because her actions were\n\nmotivated by spite and were “not in furtherance of the interests of [the District],”\n\nCompton neither pled nor argued that investigation of discrepancies in an\n                                  25\n\femployee’s documentation or setting an employee’s meeting schedule were outside\n\nthe scope of King’s authority or her official duties as the speech pathology\n\nsupervisor. Moreover, the trial court explicitly found that the actions allegedly taken\n\nby the individual defendants “were, in fact, within the scope of and/or incident to\n\ntheir duties” regardless of the individuals’ personal motivations. This finding is\n\nconsistent with section 22.0511 of the Texas Education Code, which, unlike some\n\nother types of immunity, contains no “good faith” element or requirement. See Tex.\n\nEduc. Code Ann. § 22.0511; Robinson v. Brannon, 313 S.W.3d 860, 866 n.3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.); c.f., City of Lancaster v. Chambers, 883\n\nS.W.2d 650, 653 (Tex. 1994) (acknowledging “good faith” element as a requirement\n\nfor affirmative defense of official immunity for public servants). Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that the trial court did not err in awarding King and Brown attorney’s fees\n\nunder section 22.0517. Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §§ 22.0511, 22.0517.\n\n      In her reply brief, Compton also asserts that “[i]f the trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction over Compton’s claims for attorney’s fees under the Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act, then it lacked jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees under that Act to\n\nAppellees as well.” Compton again cites no legal authority in support of her claim.\n\nWe find that the argument is not only legally inaccurate,6 it also ignores that the basis\n\n\n      6\n          See, e.g., Devon Energy Prod. Co., 450 S.W.3d at 222–24.\n                                         26\n\ffor the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees was not the DJA, but section 25.0517 of\n\nthe Texas Education Code, as discussed above.\n\n      Finally, Compton also complains for the first time in her reply brief that the\n\nindividual defendants failed to segregate their claimed attorney’s fees between fees\n\nassociated with the assertion of professional immunity and those associated with\n\ndefending the suit on any other grounds. Compton did not raise this argument in the\n\ntrial court when the individual defendants’ request for attorney’s fees was heard, nor\n\nin her opening brief. Accordingly, we find that this argument has been waived, and\n\nis not properly before the court. See Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389\n\n(Tex. 1997) (holding that if a party fails to object in the trial court that the attorney’s\n\nfees are not segregated as to specific claims, then the objection is waived); see also\n\nTex. R. App. P. 38.3; Private Mini Storage Realty, L.P. v. Larry F. Smith, Inc., 304\n\nS.W.3d 854, 859 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.) (holding that a party may not\n\nraise a new issue in a reply brief); Green Light Co. v. Moore, 485 S.W.2d 360, 364\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1972, no writ) (“The new grounds for\n\nreversal set forth in appellants’ second brief may not be considered.”).\n\n      Having overruled each of Compton’s issues, we affirm the trial court’s orders\n\ndismissing Compton’s claims against all defendants and awarding attorney’s fees to\n\nBrown and King.\n\n                                            27\n\f      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                            ______________________________\n                                                  CHARLES KREGER\n                                                         Justice\n\nSubmitted on July 5, 2016\nOpinion Delivered July 20, 2017\n\nBefore McKeithen, C.J., Kreger and Horton, JJ.\n\n\n\n\n                                       28\n\f",

Compton began working as a Speech Language Pathologist for the District\n\nin August, 2009. In that capacity, she provided speech therapy to students at three\n\ncampuses within the school district. At some point during her first year of\n\nemployment with the District, Compton complained to her supervisors, King and\n\nSharon Boutte1, that student reports she printed from one school were being routed\n\nto a printer that was located in a public hallway at another school and that she\n\nbelieved such open access to the reports to be a problem with regard to federal\n\nstudent privacy rights. Compton alleges that after she made this complaint and\n\nattempted to have the printer set-up corrected through the District’s IT department,\n\nKing created a hostile work environment by giving Compton an “exhausting and\n\n\n      1\n        Compton named Sharon Boutte as a defendant in her original pleadings, but\nomitted Boutte as a party in her amended petition. Boutte filed a plea to the\njurisdiction jointly with Brown, King, and the District, and the trial court’s order\ngranting the plea to the jurisdiction dismissed Compton’s claims against Boutte with\nprejudice. On appeal, Compton does not challenge the dismissal of her claims\nagainst Boutte. On December 8, 2015, Compton notified this Court that Boutte was\ndropped as a party.\n                                           2\n\frigorous schedule of meetings” in late Fall 2010, and then initiating an investigation\n\nagainst Compton based on “false accusations of Medicaid fraud.”\n\n      The fraud investigation concerned Compton’s documentation of services\n\ndelivered to students. One of Compton’s duties as a speech therapist was to\n\naccurately record and report the services she provided to each student so that the\n\nDistrict could be reimbursed by Medicaid. Due to discrepancies in Compton’s\n\ndocumentation regarding the dates and times of services rendered to particular\n\nstudents, the District was never able to submit any of Compton’s paperwork to the\n\nfederal government for reimbursement. In October 2010, the District commenced an\n\ninvestigation into the documentation anomalies, and Compton was placed on\n\nadministrative leave while the investigation was pending. Following the\n\ninvestigation, Compton requested, and was granted, a reassignment as a content\n\nmastery teacher.2\n\n      After being granted her reassignment to the teaching position, Compton filed\n\nthis suit seeking a declaratory judgment that her constitutional right of free speech\n\nhad been violated and an injunction against future violations, as well as costs and\n\nattorney’s fees. Brown, King, Boutte, and the District all responded to the suit by\n\n\n      2\n        The record before this court is unclear as to the timeline between the\nconclusion of the investigation and Compton’s commencement of her reassigned\nposition; however, the precise timeline is not relevant to the dispositive issues herein.\n                                           3\n\ffiling a plea to the jurisdiction with their original answer, followed by a separate\n\nPlea to the Jurisdiction, or, Alternatively, Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the trial\n\ncourt did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. Specifically, Brown, King,\n\nand Boutte sought dismissal based on the professional immunity provided in section\n\n22.0511 of the Texas Education Code, as well as under the election of remedies\n\ndoctrine of the Texas Tort Claims Act (“TTCA”). See Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §\n\n22.0511(a) (West 2012); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.106 (West 2011). The\n\nDistrict sought dismissal based on governmental immunity, asserting that\n\nCompton’s claims did not fall within any waiver of that immunity. The District\n\nsubsequently supplemented its plea to assert that Compton’s claims were moot in\n\nlight of her having transferred at her own request. The District then supplemented\n\nits plea a second time to expand on its claim that official and governmental immunity\n\ndeprived the court of subject-matter jurisdiction over Compton’s claims because\n\nCompton had failed to allege sufficient facts in her pleadings to demonstrate that she\n\nhad any facially valid constitutional claims against the District or its employees.\n\n      The trial court conducted a non-evidentiary hearing on the defendants’ various\n\njurisdictional challenges. Following the hearing, on April 23, 2015, the trial court\n\nentered an order dismissing Compton’s claims against Brown, Boutte, and King, and\n\ndismissed those individual defendants with prejudice. The court’s order did not\n\n                                          4\n\fspecify the grounds upon which the dismissal was granted, although it did\n\nacknowledge the matter considered was both a Plea to the Jurisdiction and Motion\n\nto Dismiss filed pursuant to section 22.051 of the Texas Education Code and section\n\n101.106 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code. Shortly thereafter, on April 29,\n\n2015, the trial court entered a second order, this one granting the District’s plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction. In its order dismissing Compton’s claims against the District, the\n\ncourt found that Compton “failed to state a viable claim under the free expression\n\nclause which protects public employees engaging in free speech of public concern.”\n\n      Compton filed a Motion for New Trial as to both orders, and Brown, Boutte,\n\nand King filed an application for attorney’s fees pursuant to section 22.0511 of the\n\nTexas Education Code. The trial court held a hearing on Compton’s motion and the\n\nindividual defendants’ application. Following the hearing, the trial court issued a\n\nletter to all counsel setting forth its findings and opinions on the issues presented and\n\nadvising of its intended rulings. In its letter, dated June 24, 2015, the court elaborated\n\non its specific findings that Compton’s speech was not protected because it was\n\nmade pursuant to official duties and because it was made in a private context\n\nbetween employer and employee; therefore, Compton had failed to plead a proper\n\nconstitutional violation, rendering the granting of the District’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction appropriate. The court further found that dismissal for lack of\n\n                                            5\n\fjurisdiction was appropriate because Compton’s requested and granted transfer\n\nwithout any allegation of subsequent retaliation either deprived the case of a\n\njusticiable issue or rendered the issue moot.3\n\n       The letter also addressed the application of the individual defendants for\n\nattorney’s fees, finding that all actions taken by Brown, Boutte, and King were “in\n\nfact, within the scope of and/or incident to their duties,” which entitled them to\n\nrecovery of their collective attorney’s fees.\n\n       Finally, with regard to the dismissal of the individual defendants, the court\n\nnoted that section 22.0511 of the Texas Educational Code provided the individuals\n\nimmunity from liability, but “does not, however, provide immunity from suit, and\n\ntherefore, is not a proper basis for a Plea to the Jurisdiction.” The letter indicates that\n\nthe order dismissing the individual defendants “should be vacated”; however, no\n\norder was ever entered vacating the dismissal order. To the contrary, on July 1, 2015,\n\nthe trial court explicitly “affirm[ed] its [o]rders dismissing Plaintiff’s claims against\n\n[the District and the individual defendants] with prejudice” in a written order\n\ndenying Compton’s motion for new trial. That order also awarded attorney’s fees to\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        The trial court’s finding that Compton failed to plead a proper constitutional\nviolation, as well as its findings regarding justiciability and mootness, do not refer\nspecifically or exclusively to the District, but rather to “the defendants” collectively.\n                                            6\n\fBrown and King, jointly and severally. Compton filed a timely notice of appeal from\n\nthe orders dismissing her claims.\n\n                                     II. Analysis\n\n      Compton’s first two issues on appeal challenge the trial court’s dismissal of\n\nher claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; her third issue challenges the\n\ndismissal of Brown and King, arguing that those individuals were not entitled to\n\nprofessional immunity. Compton’s fourth issue challenges the court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Brown and King.\n\nA. Dismissal of Compton’s Claims Against the District\n\n      In filing its pleas to the jurisdiction, the District challenged the trial court’s\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the claims in Compton’s pleadings, asserting that\n\nthe District was protected from suit by governmental immunity. The doctrine of\n\ngovernmental immunity from suit operates like sovereign immunity to defeat a trial\n\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction over a claim against a political subdivision, like a\n\nschool district, unless the state has expressly consented to suit. Harris County v.\n\nSykes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894530\"><a href=\"/opinion/894530/harris-county-v-sykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638 (Tex. 2004). As such, governmental immunity may be\n\nproperly raised in a plea to the jurisdiction. Id.

When, as is the case here, a plea to the\n\njurisdiction challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s pleadings to establish a\n\nwaiver of governmental immunity, and thereby establish jurisdiction, we must\n\ndetermine whether the plaintiff has pled a facially valid constitutional claim.

If the pleadings fail to allege sufficient facts\n\nto demonstrate jurisdiction, but the deficiency is curable, the plaintiff “should be\n\nafforded the opportunity to amend.” Id. at 226–27.

Failure to State a Claim\n\n      Compton argues that the trial court’s grant of the District’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction for failure to state a claim was improper because Compton’s speech was,\n\n                                            8\n\fas a matter of law, protected under the Texas Constitution. Although Compton\n\nargues that the protections afforded to her under article I, section 8 of the Texas\n\nConstitution are greater than those of the freedom of speech clause in the First\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution, we note that Texas courts have\n\ngenerally refused to hold that the Texas Constitution’s free-speech clause affords a\n\nplaintiff greater rights than does the First Amendment except in terms of prior\n\nrestraint. See generally Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Barber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758822\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758822/texas-dept-of-transp-v-barber/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (Tex.\n\n2003) (quoting Operation Rescue–Nat’l v.

Recognizing this authority,\n\nCompton attempts to distinguish her case from Barber with a “historical and textual\n\nbasis for a more expansive reading of [a]rticle 1, [s]ection 8 of the Texas\n\nConstitution”; however, in doing so, she fails to cite any authority supporting that\n\nthe elements of a free-speech claim under the Texas Constitution are different than\n\nthe elements that must be pled under a First Amendment claim, in the context of\n\nprior restraint or otherwise, nor does she demonstrate how such differences “are\n\nmaterial to [her] case.” See Bentley v.

Accordingly, we apply federal cases when analyzing Compton’s claim, and\n\nfind that Compton’s pleadings fail to allege sufficient facts to show that her speech\n\nwas protected under either article I, section 8 of the Texas Constitution or under the\n\nFreedom of Speech Clause in the First Amendment.

Thus, the true\n\ncontent of her speech was a complaint that the way the District’s printers were\n\ninstalled could result in Compton herself disclosing private student information if\n\nshe printed her Medicaid reports to a particular location without having another\n\nemployee there to retrieve them, and a request that the District’s IT personnel install\n\nthe printers differently. Such matters directly concerned Compton’s official duties\n\n                                          12\n\fin creating and submitting reports, and the way printers were installed by the\n\norganization that employed her. See Turner, 278 S.W.3d at 816. Moreover, her\n\npleadings do not allege, nor does the record as a whole reveal, that she ever spoke\n\nof this matter to anyone other than Boutte, King, and the District’s IT personnel. As\n\na result, her pleadings do not allege sufficient facts to show that she had engaged in\n\nany constitutionally protected speech regarding matters of “public concern.” See id.;\n\nTeague, 179 F.3d at 383. Moreover, Compton has not requested an opportunity to\n\nplead additional facts to demonstrate jurisdiction. Accordingly, based on the record\n\nthat was before the trial court, we hold that the court did not err in finding that\n\nCompton failed to plead a facially valid constitutional claim against the District.\n\n      Compton also complains on appeal that the only proper mechanism for the\n\nDistrict to seek dismissal of her claims for failure to plead a facially valid\n\nconstitutional claim would have been a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 91a of\n\nthe Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which Compton asserts that the District did not\n\ntimely file. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a. Although Compton is correct that the District\n\ncould have sought dismissal with such a motion, “Rule 91a is not the exclusive\n\nmeans that a defendant may use to test the validity of a plaintiff’s pleadings.”\n\nJackson v.

A plea to the\n\n                                         13\n\fjurisdiction is also a proper way to challenge the facial validity of a constitutional\n\nclaim against a political subdivision. See, e.g., Johnson, 353 S.W.3d at 502.\n\nAccordingly, we find Compton’s argument regarding Rule 91a to be without merit.\n\n      Finally, in her reply brief, Compton argues that the trial court had jurisdiction\n\nover her claims because the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”) permits\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees even by a non-prevailing party. Although Compton’s first\n\namended petition—her live pleading at the time of dismissal—does not allege any\n\nlegal basis for recovery of attorney’s fees, her reply brief indicates that the claim is\n\nmade pursuant to section 37.009 of the DJA. The Texas Supreme Court has held that\n\nthe DJA waives governmental immunity from suit for a claim for attorney’s fees\n\nunder section 37.009 when the claim for attorney’s fees is made in connection with\n\na claim for declaratory relief that falls within the limited waiver of immunity\n\ncontained in section 37.006(b) of the DJA.

However, Compton’s request for declaratory judgment does not\n\nfall within section 37.006(b)’s limited waiver of immunity because nothing in her\n\nclaims challenges the validity of an ordinance, statute, or franchise.

In pertinent part, Compton’s\n\n                                         17\n\fpleadings and argument establish that she requested and received a reassignment\n\naway from King prior to filing this action, and that after the transfer, it was\n\n“impossible for Defendants’ [sic] to continue their harassment of her because she is\n\nno longer working with them.” The trial court, acknowledging these undisputed\n\nfacts, stated in its June 24 letter to counsel that “[r]egardless of whether this would\n\nbe considered as depriving the case of a justiciable issue or rendering the issue moot,\n\ndismissal for lack of jurisdiction is warranted.”4 The record, both before the trial\n\ncourt and in Compton’s own argument on appeal, affirmatively negates any need for\n\nadditional evidence or proof, as it is undisputed that Compton was no longer being\n\nsubjected to any alleged harassment before she filed suit.\n\n      Compton also argues for the first time in her reply brief that her claim for\n\nattorney’s fees under the DJA remains a live controversy even if the mootness\n\ndoctrine prevents her from prevailing on her request for substantive relief. Even if\n\nCompton had presented this argument in her opening brief, it would not have\n\n\n\n      4\n         Neither the trial court’s order granting the plea to the jurisdiction nor the\norder denying a new trial and affirming the dismissal of all parties address the issue\nof mootness; however, the trial court’s letter ruling explicitly identified mootness or\nthe absence of a justiciable issue as a basis supporting dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction, and both parties have, in their respective briefs, treated the letter ruling\nas providing a basis of the court’s dismissal of all claims. Accordingly, we treat the\ntrial court’s letter rulings as competent evidence of the trial court’s basis for\ndismissing the claims.\n                                           18\n\fsupported reversal, as Compton’s case is fundamentally distinguishable from each\n\nof the cases upon which she relies in support of her argument. Specifically,\n\nCompton’s claim that her request for attorney’s fees remains a “live controversy”\n\ndespite the mootness of her substantive claims ignores the subtle distinction between\n\na case that lacked justiciability from the moment of pleading and a case wherein\n\nsome event “extinguished what was initially a live controversy, a justiciable case\n\nbetween proper parties.” See Travelers Ins.

We decline to extend\nthat court’s reasoning to allow a claimant to continue to pursue her own attorney’s\nfees when she lacked standing at the outset to seek the underlying substantive relief.\n                                            20\n\frequest for attorney’s fees under the DJA can “revive” a claim that was not a live\n\ncontroversy at its legal inception.\n\nB. Dismissal of Compton’s Claims Against the Individual Defendants\n\n      In her third issue, Compton challenges the trial court’s dismissal of her claims\n\nagainst Brown and King, individually. Specifically, Compton argues that Brown and\n\nKing were not entitled to immunity or dismissal under the TTCA because they were\n\neach acting ultra vires, outside the scope of their legitimate duties, and because she\n\nsought only declaratory and injunctive relief on constitutional grounds, rather than\n\ndamages for tort. However, we need not address the merits of Compton’s claims,\n\nnor the applicability of the election of remedies doctrine in light of the trial court’s\n\nfactual finding that King and Brown were acting “within the scope of and/or incident\n\nto their duties,” because we find that Compton’s ultra vires claims against the\n\nindividual defendants suffer from the same dispositive absence of a justiciable issue\n\nas her claims against the District, depriving the trial court of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.\n\n      Although the trial court did state in its letter to counsel that dismissal of\n\nCompton’s claims for lack of jurisdiction was warranted for mootness or lack of a\n\njusticiable issue, none of the orders that were entered by the court dismissing the\n\nclaims against the individual defendants specifically articulated the absence of a\n\n                                          21\n\fjusticiable issue as the actual basis for dismissal, referencing instead only section\n\n22.0511 of the Texas Education Code and section 101.106 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code. Nevertheless, as the existence of justiciable claim is\n\na threshold component of subject matter jurisdiction, we consider Compton’s\n\nstanding sua sponte as a ground upon which to affirm the trial court’s finding that it\n\nlacked jurisdiction over Compton’s claims. See Tex. Workers’ Comp. Comm’n v.\n\nGarcia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1528314\"><a href=\"/opinion/1528314/texas-workerscompensation-comn-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 n.15 (Tex. 1995); Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at\n\n446. As we have already set forth in response to Compton’s second issue above,\n\neven construed liberally and in her favor, Compton’s pleadings not only fail to\n\nallege, but rather affirmatively negate, the existence of any justiciable controversy\n\nagainst the District or the individual defendants. Accordingly, the trial court’s\n\ndismissal of Compton’s claims against Brown and King for lack of jurisdiction was\n\nproper. See Robinson, 298 S.W.3d at 327; Pate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">172509</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2; Williams,\n\n52 S.W.3d at 184.\n\nC. Award of Attorney’s Fees to Individual Defendants\n\n      In her final point of error, Compton asserts that the trial court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees to Brown and King should be reversed because the description of the\n\nrendered legal services provided in their claim for fees did not specify which services\n\nbilled were for whom among Brown, King, and Boutte, individually.\n                                          22\n\f      We review de novo both the availability of attorney’s fees under a particular\n\nstatute and the need to segregate attorney’s fees, as such issues are questions of law.\n\nJakab v.

App.—Austin 2014, pet. denied).\n\n      The application for attorney’s fees at issue was filed jointly by Brown, King,\n\nand Boutte. The record does not contain a written response by Compton to the\n\nrequest; however, the record does indicate that a hearing was held on the matter, at\n\nwhich time Compton argued that attorney’s fees were not available to the defendants\n\nbecause Compton had not pled a tort cause of action against them, and that attorney’s\n\nfees for Boutte were inappropriate because she was only named in the style, and\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fnever listed as a defendant or served with process. After the hearing, the trial court\n\nawarded attorney’s fees to Brown and King, jointly and severally.\n\n      The individual defendants’ application for attorney’s fees did not segregate\n\nfees by party, nor did the trial court’s order award fees by party; rather, the court\n\nfound that “[t]he matters identified would have been necessary for any and all\n\ndefendants with the same amount of time having been expended.” On appeal,\n\nCompton acknowledges the trial court’s finding in this regard, yet offers no authority\n\nto support her contention that fees must nonetheless have been segregated among\n\nthe individual defendants. A review of the record on appeal supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding regarding the nature of the claimed fees, as all fees awarded were for work\n\ndone on behalf of all of the individual defendants collectively, asserting the same\n\ndefenses and arguments to a singular set of facts, almost none of which involved\n\nBoutte individually and distinct from King and Brown. Accordingly, we find that\n\nthere is evidence to support the court’s factual determination that attorney’s fees\n\ncould not be segregated.\n\n      Compton next argues that the trial court should not have awarded fees under\n\nthe Texas Education Code because her case was not actually dismissed based on the\n\nprofessional immunity provision contained in section 25.0511. Compton cites no\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fauthority in support of such a prerequisite, nor can one be found in either section\n\n22.0517 or 22.0511 of the Texas Education Code. Section 22.0517 provides:\n\n      In an action against a professional employee of a school district\n      involving an act that is incidental to or within the scope of duties of the\n      employee’s position of employment and brought against the employee\n      in the employee’s individual capacity, the employee is entitled to\n      recover attorney’s fees and court costs from the plaintiff if the employee\n      is found immune from liability under this subchapter.\n\nTex. Educ. Code Ann. § 22.0517 (West 2012). In turn, Section 22.0511, which\n\nestablishes “immunity” for the purposes of Chapter 22, provides:\n\n      A professional employee of a school district is not personally liable for\n      any act that is incident to or within the scope of the duties of the\n      employee’s position of employment and that involves the exercise of\n      judgment or discretion on the part of the employee, except in\n      circumstances in which a professional employee uses excessive force\n      in the discipline of students or negligence resulting in bodily injury to\n      students.\n\nId. § 22.0511(a). Nothing in section 22.0517 makes dismissal based on 22.0511 a\n\nprerequisite to recovery of attorney’s fees; rather, read together, these provisions\n\nrequire only a finding or determination that a defendant is immune from liability as\n\na professional employee in order to be entitled to receive fees. See Ward v. Theret,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2539230\"><a href=\"/opinion/2539230/ward-v-theret/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 675–76 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 2009, no pet.). Although\n\nCompton argues that King is not entitled to immunity because her actions were\n\nmotivated by spite and were “not in furtherance of the interests of [the District],”\n\nCompton neither pled nor argued that investigation of discrepancies in an\n                                  25\n\femployee’s documentation or setting an employee’s meeting schedule were outside\n\nthe scope of King’s authority or her official duties as the speech pathology\n\nsupervisor. Moreover, the trial court explicitly found that the actions allegedly taken\n\nby the individual defendants “were, in fact, within the scope of and/or incident to\n\ntheir duties” regardless of the individuals’ personal motivations. This finding is\n\nconsistent with section 22.0511 of the Texas Education Code, which, unlike some\n\nother types of immunity, contains no “good faith” element or requirement. See Tex.\n\nEduc.

Code Ann. §§ 22.0511, 22.0517.\n\n      In her reply brief, Compton also asserts that “[i]f the trial court lacked\n\njurisdiction over Compton’s claims for attorney’s fees under the Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act, then it lacked jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees under that Act to\n\nAppellees as well.” Compton again cites no legal authority in support of her claim.\n\nWe find that the argument is not only legally inaccurate,6 it also ignores that the basis\n\n\n      6\n          See, e.g., Devon Energy Prod. Co., 450 S.W.3d at 222–24.\n                                         26\n\ffor the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees was not the DJA, but section 25.0517 of\n\nthe Texas Education Code, as discussed above.\n\n      Finally, Compton also complains for the first time in her reply brief that the\n\nindividual defendants failed to segregate their claimed attorney’s fees between fees\n\nassociated with the assertion of professional immunity and those associated with\n\ndefending the suit on any other grounds. Compton did not raise this argument in the\n\ntrial court when the individual defendants’ request for attorney’s fees was heard, nor\n\nin her opening brief. Accordingly, we find that this argument has been waived, and\n\nis not properly before the court. See Green Int’l, Inc. v.
