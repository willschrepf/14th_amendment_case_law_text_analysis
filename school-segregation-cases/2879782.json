Alsop, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota, sitting by designation.\n\f      Plaintiff Ronnie Randolph, a deaf-mute prisoner in the custody of the Missouri\nDepartment of Corrections, filed this lawsuit after the Department of Corrections\nfailed to provide him with a sign language interpreter during disciplinary\nproceedings. The defendants appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a) the trial court’s\nissuance of a permanent injunction. We vacate the injunction, reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment in part, and remand.\n\n                                         I\n\n      In 1983, plaintiff Ronnie Randolph was convicted of capital murder and\nsentenced to life in prison. Randolph was initially incarcerated at Jefferson City\nCorrectional Center (“JCCC”). In 1989, Randolph was transferred to Potosi\nCorrectional Center (“PCC”). In October of 1996, Randolph was transferred back to\nJCCC.\n\n       Randolph suffers from profound hearing loss and cannot understand most\nspeech spoken at an average conversational level. Randolph’s primary means of\ncommunication is American Sign Language. When conversing with a person who\ndoes not understand sign language, Randolph can communicate to some extent via\ngestures, lip reading, and speaking. The degree to which these methods work\ndepends on the patience of the person trying to communicate with Randolph and how\nlong they have interacted with him. When these methods are inadequate, Randolph\nreads and writes messages in standard English. Randolph wears hearing aids\nprovided by the Department of Corrections, but both parties’ experts agree that they\nare insufficient for his level of hearing loss. Even with improved hearing aids,\nRandolph would have difficulty understanding most speech.2\n\n\n      2\n       Randolph’s expert testified that he believed hearing aids rather than an\ninterpreter would be preferable for Randolph because an interpreter would isolate\nRandolph from the prison population.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f       In 1989, after he was transferred to PCC, Randolph filed a grievance requesting\na sign language interpreter for all stages of prison disciplinary proceedings, medical\nprocedures, educational programs and counseling, and all programs and activities\nrelating to prison confinement. PCC has been unable to locate their response to the\ngrievance. The parties agree, however, that no interpreter was provided for Randolph\nfollowing his 1989 request.\n\n      In 1993, Randolph received two conduct violations. After Randolph submitted\nwritten statements on his own behalf, the violations were dismissed and no discipline\nwas imposed. Randolph did not request a sign language interpreter in either\nproceeding.\n\n       In 1994, Randolph received three additional conduct violations. In February,\nRandolph was written up for insulting behavior and disobeying an order. Randolph\nwas found guilty of the violations in a disciplinary proceeding. Randolph did not\nrequest a sign language interpreter prior to the hearing on his conduct violations.\nHowever, on March 3, 1994, Randolph filed an informal resolution request (“IRR”)\nasking that the violations be expunged from his records. He also requested that\n“effective immediately the Dept. of Corr. employ a capable staff person whom can\nassist me with my needs to communicate with the staff personnel.” The IRR was\ndenied. Randolph then filed a formal grievance appealing his conduct violations. In\nhis grievance, Randolph wrote “I ask that the Potosi Corr. Center hire/employ an\ninterppreter [sic] for persons like myself, to insure meaningful communications.” The\nSuperintendent of PCC denied Randolph’s grievance and stated that his “request for\nan interperator [sic] is a separate subject and will not be addressed.”\n\n       In early July of 1994, Randolph received a conduct violation for assault after\nhe threw two boxes of cookies at a food service worker. At the disciplinary hearing\non July 6, Randolph submitted a written statement in his defense and did not request\na sign language interpreter. Because of the seriousness of the assault violation, a\n\n                                         -3-\n\fclassification hearing was held on July 7. As a result of the classification hearing,\nRandolph was placed in administrative segregation.\n\n      On September 2, Randolph submitted a grievance complaining that he had been\ndenied due process during the assault disciplinary hearing because he was not\nprovided with a qualified interpreter as required by Missouri state law. On October\n5, 1994, Randolph’s grievance was denied with the comment that Randolph had not\nasked for an interpreter at the time of the hearing and that he had fully understood the\nproceedings, as evidenced by the statement he submitted on his own behalf.\nRandolph then filed a first and second grievance appeal. Both appeals were denied\nby the Department of Corrections.3\n\n                                          II\n\n       On May 18, 1994, Randolph filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis with\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Randolph’s\nmotion was forwarded to the Court’s pro se unit. On August 25, 1994, the Court\ngranted Randolph’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. On the same day,\nRandolph’s original complaint was filed. Randolph eventually filed a first and\nsecond amended complaint. The second amended complaint named the Missouri\nDepartment of Corrections, Bill Rodgers, Don Roper, Paul Delo, Michael Bowersox,\nand Dora Schriro as defendants. Rodgers was Randolph’s Correctional Classification\nAssistant at PCC and served as a hearing officer during one of Randolph’s\ndisciplinary proceedings. Roper was the Associate Superintendent at PCC from 1989\nto 1995 and reviewed Randolph’s requests for a sign language interpreter. Delo was\nPCC’s Superintendent from 1989 to 1995 and reviewed and denied Randolph’s\n\n\n      3\n       Randolph also wrote letters to prison officials outside the grievance process\ncomplaining that his due process rights had been violated due to PCC’s failure to\nprovide a sign language interpreter.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fgrievances requesting an interpreter. Bowersox replaced Delo as PCC’s\nsuperintendent in August of 1995. Schriro is director of the Missouri Department of\nCorrections and reviewed and denied a request for an interpreter. Randolph’s second\namended complaint asserts five claims -- due process and equal protection violations\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Counts I and II), violations of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”) (Count III), violations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n(“RA”) (Count IV), and violations of Missouri Statute § 476.750 (Count V).\n\n       The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On October 10, 1997,\nthe district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the due\nprocess and equal protection claims. The district court also granted the individual\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment on the ADA and RA claims, finding the\nindividuals were not “employers” subject to suit under the ADA or the RA.4 The\ncourt granted Randolph’s motion for summary judgment as to liability on the ADA,\nRA, and Missouri Statute § 476.750 claims against the Department of Corrections,\nand reserved for trial the issue of damages against the Department of Corrections.\nFinally, the trial court reserved for trial the issue of money damages on the state law\nclaim against the individual defendants.5\n\n\n      4\n        In addition, the district court dismissed Bowersox as an individual defendant\nbecause he was not involved in the acts alleged in the complaint. The portions of the\ndistrict court’s order granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the\ndue process and equal protection claims, granting the individual defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment on the ADA and RA claims, and dismissing Bowersox as a\ndefendant are not before us at this time.\n      5\n       Although we need not address the issue on this appeal from an injunction, see\ndiscussion infra, we note that it is unclear from the district court’s opinion whether\nthe court granted Randolph’s motion for summary judgment as to liability on the state\nlaw claim against the individual defendants or reserved that issue for trial. On\nremand, the district court may clarify whether trial on both liability and damages, or\non damages only, is required as to the individual defendants on Count V.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      After finding in favor of Randolph on his ADA, RA, and Missouri state law\nclaim against the Department of Corrections, the District court issued a permanent\ninjunction, based on its summary judgment rulings, which ordered:\n\n             that the Missouri Department of Corrections, and its\n             agents, including any prison facility within which plaintiff\n             is now or hereafter shall be confined, and all officers or\n             persons having control of such prison facilities and its\n             programs, shall hereafter provide plaintiff with sign\n             language interpreter services whenever he is the subject of\n             a non-emergency disciplinary or classification hearing,\n             during all non-emergency medical care, and during any\n             educational programs in which plaintiff participates.\n\nFinally, the district court certified the summary judgment order, including the\ninjunction, for immediate appeal as involving a “controlling question of law as to\nwhich there is substantial ground for difference of opinion” under 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(b).\n\n       On November 19, 1997, the defendants filed a petition with this Court for\npermission to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). The Court\ndenied the defendants’ petition. The defendants then filed a timely notice of appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a), which provides that the courts of appeals have\njurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts granting,\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or\nmodify injunctions.\n\n      On appeal, the defendants raise six primary issues:\n\n             1. Whether the district court lacked subject matter\n             jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             because plaintiff’s claims were moot due to plaintiff’s\n             transfer to another prison.\n\n             2. Whether the district court erred in granting summary\n             judgment because there was no showing of discrimination\n             based on plaintiff’s disability.\n\n             3. Whether the district court erred in granting summary\n             judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact\n             as to whether a sign language interpreter is a reasonable\n             accommodation and whether this accommodation imposes\n             an undue burden due to the safety and security concerns\n             and financial burden.\n\n             4. Whether the district court erred in finding that plaintiff\n             is entitled to trial on damages under the ADA, RA and state\n             law claims when plaintiff has not shown intentional\n             discrimination.\n\n             5. Whether the district court abused its discretion in\n             issuing broadly worded injunctive relief ordering a sign\n             language interpreter at any prison where plaintiff is\n             incarcerated for all remaining years of plaintiff’s life\n             sentence.\n\n             6. Whether the district court erred in taking jurisdiction of\n             the pendent state law claim when the relief sought directly\n             impacts the State and is barred by the Eleventh\n             Amendment.\n\nOn an appeal from an injunction, however, the issues the Court may review are\nlimited. In Fogie v. THORN Americas, Inc., 95 F.3d 645 (8th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n117 S.Ct. 1427 (1997), this Court explained the parameters of its jurisdiction to\nreview interlocutory appeals of injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a):\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f             We have jurisdiction to review the district court’s issuance\n             of the injunction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) which\n             provides for appeal of interlocutory orders granting or\n             refusing to grant injunctions. Our jurisdiction under\n             section 1292(a)(1) also extends to the remainder of the\n             appealed order to the extent the injunction is\n             interdependent with the remainder of the appealed order.\n             Under this standard, we have jurisdiction to review all\n             portions of the order that are dependent on the resolution\n             of the issues necessarily resolved in reviewing the\n             injunction order. In other words, in addition to the\n             injunction order, we may review other issues only if they\n             are inextricably bound up with the injunction. We need not\n             undertake a review of issues whose resolution is not\n             necessary to effectively review the injunction.\n\nId. at 648 (citations omitted). Our review of the district court’s summary judgment\norder is therefore limited by the extent to which it is “inextricably bound up with the\ninjunctive relief granted in this case.” Id. at 649. Applying this standard, we decline\nto review issues regarding monetary damages or issues relating to the individual\ndefendants’ liability.6 Yet we must review the order to the extent it grants summary\njudgment to Randolph on his ADA, RA, and Missouri state law claim against the\nDepartment of Corrections, because the validity of the injunction is dependent upon\nthe rulings on the summary judgment motions.\n\n       We review the district court’s issuance of a permanent injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion. See, e.g., F.D.I.C. v. Bell, 106 F.3d 258, 262-63 (8th Cir. 1997); Baker\nElec. Coop., Inc. v. Chaske, 28 F.3d 1466, 1472 (8th Cir. 1994); ILQ Investments, Inc.\nv. City of Rochester, 25 F.3d 1413, 1416 (8th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1017\n(1994). “Abuse of discretion occurs if the district court reaches its conclusion by\n\n\n      6\n       The injunction was entered against the Department of Corrections only, not\nthe individual defendants.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fapplying erroneous legal principles or relying on clearly erroneous factual findings.”\nSee, e.g., Fogle, 95 F.3d at 649. To the extent we examine the district court’s\nsummary judgment decision, the standard of review is de novo. Summary judgment\nis appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Rifkin v.\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 78 F.3d 1277, 1280 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                            III\n\nA.     Mootness\n       The Department of Corrections argues the district court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to issue injunctive relief because Randolph’s claims were mooted by his\ntransfer from JCCC to PCC in 1996. The district court apparently assumed for the\nsake of argument that Randolph’s equitable claims were mooted by the transfer, but\nheld they fell within the exception for claims capable of repetition yet evading\nreview. The district court found:\n\n              [neither] plaintiff’s deafness nor his life sentence within\n              the Missouri Department of Corrections is at all likely to\n              change. If relief were denied as moot, defendants could\n              simply transfer plaintiff back and forth between PCC and\n              JCCC (or other facilities) to evade review of these issues\n              by any Court.\n\nHowever, the district court’s analysis went too far by applying the capable of\nrepetition yet evading review exception, as Randolph’s claims for injunctive relief\nwere not moot.7\n\n\n       7\n         The capable of repetition yet evading review rule is an extraordinary and\nnarrow exception to the mootness doctrine. It applies when (1) the challenged action\nis in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2)\nthere is a reasonable expectation the complaining party will be subject to the same\n\n                                            -9-\n\f       A claim for equitable relief is moot “absent a showing of irreparable injury, a\nrequirement that cannot be met where there is no showing of any real or immediate\nthreat that the plaintiff will be wronged again.” City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461\nU.S. 95, 111 (1983). The defendants rely on Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d 1334 (8th\nCir. 1985), to support their mootness argument. In Martin, this Court held that once\nan inmate is transferred to another institution, his claim for injunctive relief against\nthe warden of the first prison to improve the former prison’s conditions is moot. Id.\nat 1337. Martin is readily distinguished from this case and does not control. In\nMartin, the injunction sought could not address future wrongs the plaintiff was likely\nto suffer because the first warden had no control over the second prison. The same\ncannot be said in Randolph’s action. Randolph asserts claims directly against the\nMissouri Department of Corrections, and alleges the Department of Corrections\nviolated his rights under the ADA, the RA and under Missouri state law by failing to\nprovide him with a sign language interpreter. Thus, unlike the plaintiff in Martin,\nRandolph has claimed he is exposed to an actual future threat under the control of the\nDepartment of Corrections -- that he will not be provided an interpreter. Moreover,\nthe injunction was issued against Missouri’s Department of Corrections, which\ncontrols both prisons and the funding necessary to provide the sign language\ninterpreter requested by Randolph. Accordingly, Randolph’s claims for injunctive\nrelief are not moot.\nB.     The ADA and RA Claims\n\n\n\n\naction again. See, e.g., Hickman v. Missouri, 144 F.3d 1141, 1143 (8th Cir. 1998)\n(quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 118 S. Ct. 978, 988 (1998)). Randolph was\ntransferred once prior to his litigation and once after commencing his litigation.\nNothing in this case suggests that the Department of Corrections has transferred or\nwill transfer Randolph in an attempt to moot his claim. Had Randolph’s claims been\nmoot, we doubt the mere possibility of a transfer would have been sufficient to\nsupport application of this exception.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f       The Department of Corrections next argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion by issuing an injunction to enforce Randolph’s ADA and RA claims. The\nstandard for determining whether a permanent injunction should issue is essentially\nthe same as the familiar standard for a preliminary injunction. See Amoco Prods. Co.\nv. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12 (1987). In a preliminary injunction, a\ndistrict court must balance four factors to determine whether injunctive relief is\nmerited: 1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; 2) the balance between this\nharm and the harm to the nonmoving party should the injunction issue; 3) the\nlikelihood of success on the merits; and 4) the public interest. See Fogie v. THORN\nAms., Inc., 95 F.3d 645, 654 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C.L. Sys.,\nInc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. 1981). “The standard is the same for a permanent\ninjunction except that the movant must show actual success on the merits.” Amoco\nProds. Co., 480 U.S. at 546 n.12.\n\n       The district court did not make express findings regarding the four injunction\nfactors in its order. Although express findings may have clarified the district court’s\nreasoning, they are of little import on appeal as the defendants challenge only the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that Randolph succeeded on the merits of his ADA and RA\nclaim.8 Therefore, we must review the district court conclusions that support the\ninjunction -- the grant of summary judgment to Randolph on his ADA and RA claims\nagainst the Department of Corrections.\n\n      Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., prohibits qualified individuals\nwith disabilities from being excluded from participation in or the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity. A qualified individual with a\n\n      8\n       The defendants also argue that the district court abused its discretion by\nissuing a permanent injunction without considering the Prison Litigation Reform Act,\ncodified at 18 U.S.C. § 3626. Defendants failed to raise this issue below, and have\nthus waived the argument on appeal. See, e.g., Maypenny v. U.S., 948 F.2d 1057,\n1062 (8th Cir. 1991) (“we do not consider issues not passed on by the lower court”).\n\n                                         -11-\n\fdisability is defined as any person who “meets the essential eligibility requirements\nfor the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by\na public entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). The term “public entity” is defined as “any\ndepartment, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or\nStates or local government.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). The Supreme Court recently held\nthat Title II of the ADA applies to state prisons. See Pennsylvania Dept. of\nCorrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998).\n\n       The RA provides that no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall\nbe “excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The RA defines “program or activity” to include “all of the\noperations of a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality\nof a State or of a local government.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(b). The ADA and the RA are\n“similar in substance” and, with the exception of the RA’s federal funding\nrequirement, “cases interpreting either are applicable and interchangeable.” See\nGorman v. Bartch, 152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998) (citing Allison v. Department of\nCorrections, 94 F.3d 494, 497 (8th Cir. 1996)); see also Wooten v. Farmland Foods,\n58 F.3d 382, 385 n.2 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\n       The Department of Corrections first argues that Randolph failed to state a\nprima facie case under either the ADA or the RA. To state a prima facie claim under\nthe ADA, a plaintiff must show: 1) he is a person with a disability as defined by\nstatute; 2) he is otherwise qualified for the benefit in question; and 3) he was\nexcluded from the benefit due to discrimination based upon disability. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131 et seq.; see also Gorman, 152 F.3d at 911-12; Doe v. University of Md. Med.\nSys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1265 (4th Cir. 1995). The RA contains the additional\nrequirement that the plaintiff show the program or activity from which he is excluded\nreceives federal financial assistance. See Gorman, 152 F.3d at 911; Thomlison v. City\nof Omaha, 63 F.3d 786, 788 (8th Cir. 1995). As an affirmative defense, a defendant\n\n                                        -12-\n\fmay demonstrate that the requested accommodation would constitute an undue\nburden. See Gorman, 152 F.3d at 911.\n\n      Here, the district court held:\n\n             [t]he undisputed evidence shows that plaintiff is a disabled\n             person within the meaning of the statutes and that he is\n             otherwise qualified for the benefits in question, that is, the\n             provision of medical care, educational training, and\n             participation in disciplinary and classification proceedings.\n             The undisputed evidence also shows that although he has\n             been provided some form of those benefits, he has not\n             received the full benefits solely because of his disability.\n\nWe agree with the district court’s analysis. The Department of Corrections argues\nstrenuously that Randolph was not excluded from prison services, programs, and\nactivities. It is true that Randolph could physically attend activities. However, the\nADA and RA require that otherwise qualified individuals receive “meaningful\naccess” to programs and activities. See Bonner v. Lewis, 857 F.2d 559, 561 (9th Cir.\n1988) (quoting Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985)). The record does not\ncontain credible evidence to support a finding that Randolph enjoyed meaningful\naccess to the prison’s internal disciplinary process, even if he was capable of limited\nparticipation.\n\n       The Department of Corrections also claims that Randolph failed to make a\ntimely request for a sign language interpreter and it cannot be found liable for failing\nto provide unsolicited accommodations. See Lue v. Moore, 43 F.3d 1203, 1206 (8th\nCir. 1994); Wynne v. Tufts Univ. School of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir. 1992),\ncert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1845 (1993). The Department of Corrections alleges that\nRandolph originally made a request for an interpreter in 1989, and then failed to\nrepeat that request until after he was found guilty in the disciplinary proceedings.\nWhile it is true Randolph did not request an interpreter for the February 1994\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdisciplinary proceedings until after he was found guilty, Randolph did ask for an\ninterpreter in his March 14, 1994 IRR and appeal. When Randolph received his July\n1994 conduct violations, the Department of Corrections was on notice that Randolph\nclaimed he could not fully participate in disciplinary proceedings without an\ninterpreter. This is particularly true given the Department of Corrections’ response\nto Randolph’s March requests for an interpreter. The Department of Corrections told\nRandolph that his “[r]equest for an interperator is a separate subject and will not be\ndiscussed.” After receiving this response, it is not surprising that Randolph did not\nask for an interpreter at the July disciplinary proceeding. While it is true that public\nentities are not required to guess at what accommodations they should provide, the\nrequirement does not narrow the ADA or RA so much that the Department of\nCorrections may claim Randolph failed to request an accommodation when it\ndeclined to discuss the issue with him.\n\n       The Department of Corrections’ final argument has more merit. The\nDepartment of Corrections claims summary judgment on Randolph’s ADA and RA\nclaims was inappropriate because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding\nwhether a sign language interpreter is a reasonable accommodation or imposes an\nundue burden on the defendants -- particularly considering the heightened security\nconcerns of a prison. The district court recognized that “normally whether a\nrequested accommodation is unduly burdensome might be a question for the fact-\nfinder.” The district court rejected the Department of Corrections’ claim of undue\nburden, however, because it found that Missouri Statute § 476.750 requires the prison\nto provide an interpreter. Thus, the Court held that Missouri’s legislature had\ndetermined, as a matter of law, that such an accommodation is not unduly\nburdensome.\n\n      We disagree with the district court’s conclusion that Missouri Statute §\n476.750 alone establishes the Department of Corrections’ liability under the ADA and\nRA. The Missouri statute creates rights and duties under Missouri state law, but\n\n                                         -14-\n\fcannot be used to definitively establish rights and duties under federal law. The\ndefendants presented substantial evidence that Randolph’s request for an interpreter\ncreated safety and security issues, as well as placed a financial burden on the prison.\nThe Department of Corrections is entitled to have its evidence considered by the fact-\nfinder in this case. See, e.g., Duffy v. Riveland, 98 F.3d 447, 456 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(whether deaf plaintiff required registered sign language interpreter was fact\nquestion).\n\n       Thus, the district court erred in granting Randolph’s motion for summary\njudgment against the Department of Corrections on the ADA and RA claims, and we\nwill reverse and remand the district court’s order as to these issues. Moreover,\nwithout a finding of success on the merits of the ADA and RA claims, we must\nconclude the district court abused its discretion by issuing the injunction to remedy\nRandolph’s ADA and RA claims.\n\nC.    Missouri State Law Claim\n      The injunction issued against the Department of Corrections was also based in\npart on the district court’s conclusion that the Department of Corrections violated\nMissouri Statute § 476.750 et seq. The Missouri statute requires that “a designated\nresponsible authority shall provide” a qualified sign language interpreter at:\n\n             any proceeding concerning the well-being or rehabilitation\n             of a deaf person within a state prison, including, but not\n             limited to, any disciplinary hearing, parole hearing,\n             psychological evaluation/hearing, administrative hearing,\n             sexual assault prevention program, counseling, medical\n             care, any on-the-job or vocational training or any\n             educational program.\n\nMo. Stat. § 476.753, subd. 1(4). The Department of Corrections raises a number of\narguments addressing the merits of Randolph’s state law claim. We need not address\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fthese arguments, however, because an injunction may not be issued against the\nMissouri Department of Corrections to enforce a Missouri statute.\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment precludes a federal court from ordering a state,\nincluding its agencies or officials, to conform their conduct to state law. See\nPennhurst State. Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984); Treleven v.\nUniversity of Minn., 73 F.3d 816, 819 n.4 (8th Cir. 1996). A state may, of course,\nwaive its Pennhurst immunity. However, waiver will be found only based upon “the\nmost express language” or other “overwhelming implications from the text as will\nleave no room for any other reasonable construction.” See Welch v. Texas Dep’t of\nHwys. & Public Transp., 483 U.S. 468, 472 (1987), cited in Barnes v. Missouri, 960\nF.2d 63, 64-65 (8th Cir. 1992). Randolph does not argue, nor does the record reflect,\nthat Missouri has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to claims under Mo.\nStat. § 476.753. Thus, we must reverse the district court’s order granting Randolph’s\nmotion for summary judgment against the Department of Corrections on his claim\nunder Mo. Stat. § 476.750, and vacate the injunction.\n\n                                         IV\n\n       We VACATE the district court’s issuance of a permanent injunction because\nRandolph has failed to show success on the merits of his claims based on the present\nrecord. We REVERSE the district court’s order granting Randolph’s motion for summary\njudgment against the Department of Corrections on the ADA and RA claims, and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We REVERSE the district\ncourt’s order granting Randolph’s motion for summary judgment against the Department\nof Corrections on Randolph’s claim under Mo. Stat. § 476.750, and ORDER the district\ncourt to dismiss the state law claim against the Department of Corrections.\n\nA true copy.\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fATTEST:\n\n          CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n\n\n                             -17-\n\f",

Alsop, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota, sitting by designation.\n\f      Plaintiff Ronnie Randolph, a deaf-mute prisoner in the custody of the Missouri\nDepartment of Corrections, filed this lawsuit after the Department of Corrections\nfailed to provide him with a sign language interpreter during disciplinary\nproceedings. The defendants appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a) the trial court’s\nissuance of a permanent injunction. We vacate the injunction, reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment in part, and remand.\n\n                                         I\n\n      In 1983, plaintiff Ronnie Randolph was convicted of capital murder and\nsentenced to life in prison. Randolph was initially incarcerated at Jefferson City\nCorrectional Center (“JCCC”). In 1989, Randolph was transferred to Potosi\nCorrectional Center (“PCC”). In October of 1996, Randolph was transferred back to\nJCCC.\n\n       Randolph suffers from profound hearing loss and cannot understand most\nspeech spoken at an average conversational level. Randolph’s primary means of\ncommunication is American Sign Language. When conversing with a person who\ndoes not understand sign language, Randolph can communicate to some extent via\ngestures, lip reading, and speaking. The degree to which these methods work\ndepends on the patience of the person trying to communicate with Randolph and how\nlong they have interacted with him. When these methods are inadequate, Randolph\nreads and writes messages in standard English. Randolph wears hearing aids\nprovided by the Department of Corrections, but both parties’ experts agree that they\nare insufficient for his level of hearing loss. Even with improved hearing aids,\nRandolph would have difficulty understanding most speech.2\n\n\n      2\n       Randolph’s expert testified that he believed hearing aids rather than an\ninterpreter would be preferable for Randolph because an interpreter would isolate\nRandolph from the prison population.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f       In 1989, after he was transferred to PCC, Randolph filed a grievance requesting\na sign language interpreter for all stages of prison disciplinary proceedings, medical\nprocedures, educational programs and counseling, and all programs and activities\nrelating to prison confinement. PCC has been unable to locate their response to the\ngrievance. The parties agree, however, that no interpreter was provided for Randolph\nfollowing his 1989 request.\n\n      In 1993, Randolph received two conduct violations. After Randolph submitted\nwritten statements on his own behalf, the violations were dismissed and no discipline\nwas imposed. Randolph did not request a sign language interpreter in either\nproceeding.\n\n       In 1994, Randolph received three additional conduct violations. In February,\nRandolph was written up for insulting behavior and disobeying an order. Randolph\nwas found guilty of the violations in a disciplinary proceeding. Randolph did not\nrequest a sign language interpreter prior to the hearing on his conduct violations.\nHowever, on March 3, 1994, Randolph filed an informal resolution request (“IRR”)\nasking that the violations be expunged from his records. He also requested that\n“effective immediately the Dept. of Corr. employ a capable staff person whom can\nassist me with my needs to communicate with the staff personnel.” The IRR was\ndenied. Randolph then filed a formal grievance appealing his conduct violations. In\nhis grievance, Randolph wrote “I ask that the Potosi Corr. Center hire/employ an\ninterppreter [sic] for persons like myself, to insure meaningful communications.” The\nSuperintendent of PCC denied Randolph’s grievance and stated that his “request for\nan interperator [sic] is a separate subject and will not be addressed.”\n\n       In early July of 1994, Randolph received a conduct violation for assault after\nhe threw two boxes of cookies at a food service worker. At the disciplinary hearing\non July 6, Randolph submitted a written statement in his defense and did not request\na sign language interpreter. Because of the seriousness of the assault violation, a\n\n                                         -3-\n\fclassification hearing was held on July 7. As a result of the classification hearing,\nRandolph was placed in administrative segregation.\n\n      On September 2, Randolph submitted a grievance complaining that he had been\ndenied due process during the assault disciplinary hearing because he was not\nprovided with a qualified interpreter as required by Missouri state law. On October\n5, 1994, Randolph’s grievance was denied with the comment that Randolph had not\nasked for an interpreter at the time of the hearing and that he had fully understood the\nproceedings, as evidenced by the statement he submitted on his own behalf.\nRandolph then filed a first and second grievance appeal. Both appeals were denied\nby the Department of Corrections.3\n\n                                          II\n\n       On May 18, 1994, Randolph filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis with\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Randolph’s\nmotion was forwarded to the Court’s pro se unit. On August 25, 1994, the Court\ngranted Randolph’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. On the same day,\nRandolph’s original complaint was filed. Randolph eventually filed a first and\nsecond amended complaint. The second amended complaint named the Missouri\nDepartment of Corrections, Bill Rodgers, Don Roper, Paul Delo, Michael Bowersox,\nand Dora Schriro as defendants. Rodgers was Randolph’s Correctional Classification\nAssistant at PCC and served as a hearing officer during one of Randolph’s\ndisciplinary proceedings. Roper was the Associate Superintendent at PCC from 1989\nto 1995 and reviewed Randolph’s requests for a sign language interpreter. Delo was\nPCC’s Superintendent from 1989 to 1995 and reviewed and denied Randolph’s\n\n\n      3\n       Randolph also wrote letters to prison officials outside the grievance process\ncomplaining that his due process rights had been violated due to PCC’s failure to\nprovide a sign language interpreter.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fgrievances requesting an interpreter. Bowersox replaced Delo as PCC’s\nsuperintendent in August of 1995. Schriro is director of the Missouri Department of\nCorrections and reviewed and denied a request for an interpreter. Randolph’s second\namended complaint asserts five claims -- due process and equal protection violations\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Counts I and II), violations of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”) (Count III), violations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n(“RA”) (Count IV), and violations of Missouri Statute § 476.750 (Count V).\n\n       The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On October 10, 1997,\nthe district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the due\nprocess and equal protection claims. The district court also granted the individual\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment on the ADA and RA claims, finding the\nindividuals were not “employers” subject to suit under the ADA or the RA.4 The\ncourt granted Randolph’s motion for summary judgment as to liability on the ADA,\nRA, and Missouri Statute § 476.750 claims against the Department of Corrections,\nand reserved for trial the issue of damages against the Department of Corrections.\nFinally, the trial court reserved for trial the issue of money damages on the state law\nclaim against the individual defendants.5\n\n\n      4\n        In addition, the district court dismissed Bowersox as an individual defendant\nbecause he was not involved in the acts alleged in the complaint. The portions of the\ndistrict court’s order granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the\ndue process and equal protection claims, granting the individual defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment on the ADA and RA claims, and dismissing Bowersox as a\ndefendant are not before us at this time.\n      5\n       Although we need not address the issue on this appeal from an injunction, see\ndiscussion infra, we note that it is unclear from the district court’s opinion whether\nthe court granted Randolph’s motion for summary judgment as to liability on the state\nlaw claim against the individual defendants or reserved that issue for trial. On\nremand, the district court may clarify whether trial on both liability and damages, or\non damages only, is required as to the individual defendants on Count V.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      After finding in favor of Randolph on his ADA, RA, and Missouri state law\nclaim against the Department of Corrections, the District court issued a permanent\ninjunction, based on its summary judgment rulings, which ordered:\n\n             that the Missouri Department of Corrections, and its\n             agents, including any prison facility within which plaintiff\n             is now or hereafter shall be confined, and all officers or\n             persons having control of such prison facilities and its\n             programs, shall hereafter provide plaintiff with sign\n             language interpreter services whenever he is the subject of\n             a non-emergency disciplinary or classification hearing,\n             during all non-emergency medical care, and during any\n             educational programs in which plaintiff participates.\n\nFinally, the district court certified the summary judgment order, including the\ninjunction, for immediate appeal as involving a “controlling question of law as to\nwhich there is substantial ground for difference of opinion” under 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(b).\n\n       On November 19, 1997, the defendants filed a petition with this Court for\npermission to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). The Court\ndenied the defendants’ petition. The defendants then filed a timely notice of appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a), which provides that the courts of appeals have\njurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts granting,\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or\nmodify injunctions.\n\n      On appeal, the defendants raise six primary issues:\n\n             1. Whether the district court lacked subject matter\n             jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             because plaintiff’s claims were moot due to plaintiff’s\n             transfer to another prison.\n\n             2. Whether the district court erred in granting summary\n             judgment because there was no showing of discrimination\n             based on plaintiff’s disability.\n\n             3. Whether the district court erred in granting summary\n             judgment because there are genuine issues of material fact\n             as to whether a sign language interpreter is a reasonable\n             accommodation and whether this accommodation imposes\n             an undue burden due to the safety and security concerns\n             and financial burden.\n\n             4. Whether the district court erred in finding that plaintiff\n             is entitled to trial on damages under the ADA, RA and state\n             law claims when plaintiff has not shown intentional\n             discrimination.\n\n             5. Whether the district court abused its discretion in\n             issuing broadly worded injunctive relief ordering a sign\n             language interpreter at any prison where plaintiff is\n             incarcerated for all remaining years of plaintiff’s life\n             sentence.\n\n             6. Whether the district court erred in taking jurisdiction of\n             the pendent state law claim when the relief sought directly\n             impacts the State and is barred by the Eleventh\n             Amendment.\n\nOn an appeal from an injunction, however, the issues the Court may review are\nlimited.

Our jurisdiction under\n             section 1292(a)(1) also extends to the remainder of the\n             appealed order to the extent the injunction is\n             interdependent with the remainder of the appealed order.\n             Under this standard, we have jurisdiction to review all\n             portions of the order that are dependent on the resolution\n             of the issues necessarily resolved in reviewing the\n             injunction order. In other words, in addition to the\n             injunction order, we may review other issues only if they\n             are inextricably bound up with the injunction. We need not\n             undertake a review of issues whose resolution is not\n             necessary to effectively review the injunction.\n\nId. at 648 (citations omitted). Our review of the district court’s summary judgment\norder is therefore limited by the extent to which it is “inextricably bound up with the\ninjunctive relief granted in this case.” Id. at 649. Applying this standard, we decline\nto review issues regarding monetary damages or issues relating to the individual\ndefendants’ liability.6 Yet we must review the order to the extent it grants summary\njudgment to Randolph on his ADA, RA, and Missouri state law claim against the\nDepartment of Corrections, because the validity of the injunction is dependent upon\nthe rulings on the summary judgment motions.\n\n       We review the district court’s issuance of a permanent injunction for abuse of\ndiscretion.

Mootness\n       The Department of Corrections argues the district court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to issue injunctive relief because Randolph’s claims were mooted by his\ntransfer from JCCC to PCC in 1996. The district court apparently assumed for the\nsake of argument that Randolph’s equitable claims were mooted by the transfer, but\nheld they fell within the exception for claims capable of repetition yet evading\nreview. The district court found:\n\n              [neither] plaintiff’s deafness nor his life sentence within\n              the Missouri Department of Corrections is at all likely to\n              change. If relief were denied as moot, defendants could\n              simply transfer plaintiff back and forth between PCC and\n              JCCC (or other facilities) to evade review of these issues\n              by any Court.\n\nHowever, the district court’s analysis went too far by applying the capable of\nrepetition yet evading review exception, as Randolph’s claims for injunctive relief\nwere not moot.7\n\n\n       7\n         The capable of repetition yet evading review rule is an extraordinary and\nnarrow exception to the mootness doctrine. It applies when (1) the challenged action\nis in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2)\nthere is a reasonable expectation the complaining party will be subject to the same\n\n                                            -9-\n\f       A claim for equitable relief is moot “absent a showing of irreparable injury, a\nrequirement that cannot be met where there is no showing of any real or immediate\nthreat that the plaintiff will be wronged again.” City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 111 (1983). The defendants rely on Martin v. Sargent, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463200\"><a href=\"/opinion/463200/allen-frank-martin-v-willis-sargent-warden-cummins-unit-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th\nCir. 1985), to support their mootness argument. In Martin, this Court held that once\nan inmate is transferred to another institution, his claim for injunctive relief against\nthe warden of the first prison to improve the former prison’s conditions is moot. Id.\nat 1337. Martin is readily distinguished from this case and does not control. In\nMartin, the injunction sought could not address future wrongs the plaintiff was likely\nto suffer because the first warden had no control over the second prison. The same\ncannot be said in Randolph’s action. Randolph asserts claims directly against the\nMissouri Department of Corrections, and alleges the Department of Corrections\nviolated his rights under the ADA, the RA and under Missouri state law by failing to\nprovide him with a sign language interpreter. Thus, unlike the plaintiff in Martin,\nRandolph has claimed he is exposed to an actual future threat under the control of the\nDepartment of Corrections -- that he will not be provided an interpreter. Moreover,\nthe injunction was issued against Missouri’s Department of Corrections, which\ncontrols both prisons and the funding necessary to provide the sign language\ninterpreter requested by Randolph. Accordingly, Randolph’s claims for injunctive\nrelief are not moot.\nB.     The ADA and RA Claims\n\n\n\n\naction again. See, e.g., Hickman v.

Randolph was\ntransferred once prior to his litigation and once after commencing his litigation.\nNothing in this case suggests that the Department of Corrections has transferred or\nwill transfer Randolph in an attempt to moot his claim. Had Randolph’s claims been\nmoot, we doubt the mere possibility of a transfer would have been sufficient to\nsupport application of this exception.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f       The Department of Corrections next argues that the district court abused its\ndiscretion by issuing an injunction to enforce Randolph’s ADA and RA claims. The\nstandard for determining whether a permanent injunction should issue is essentially\nthe same as the familiar standard for a preliminary injunction. See Amoco Prods. Co.\nv. Village of Gambell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111842\"><a href=\"/opinion/111842/amoco-production-co-v-gambell/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 n.12 (1987). In a preliminary injunction, a\ndistrict court must balance four factors to determine whether injunctive relief is\nmerited: 1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; 2) the balance between this\nharm and the harm to the nonmoving party should the injunction issue; 3) the\nlikelihood of success on the merits; and 4) the public interest. See Fogie v. THORN\nAms., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726119\"><a href=\"/opinion/726119/vickie-fogie-joan-leonard-and-angela-adams-on-behalf-of-themselves-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 654 (8th Cir. 1996) (citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v.

Co., 480 U.S. at 546 n.12.\n\n       The district court did not make express findings regarding the four injunction\nfactors in its order. Although express findings may have clarified the district court’s\nreasoning, they are of little import on appeal as the defendants challenge only the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that Randolph succeeded on the merits of his ADA and RA\nclaim.8 Therefore, we must review the district court conclusions that support the\ninjunction -- the grant of summary judgment to Randolph on his ADA and RA claims\nagainst the Department of Corrections.\n\n      Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., prohibits qualified individuals\nwith disabilities from being excluded from participation in or the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity.

Defendants failed to raise this issue below, and have\nthus waived the argument on appeal. See, e.g., Maypenny v.

To state a prima facie claim under\nthe ADA, a plaintiff must show: 1) he is a person with a disability as defined by\nstatute; 2) he is otherwise qualified for the benefit in question; and 3) he was\nexcluded from the benefit due to discrimination based upon disability. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131 et seq.; see also Gorman, 152 F.3d at 911-12; Doe v. University of Md. Med.\nSys. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692288\"><a href=\"/opinion/692288/john-doe-v-university-of-maryland-medical-system-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265 (4th Cir. 1995). The RA contains the additional\nrequirement that the plaintiff show the program or activity from which he is excluded\nreceives federal financial assistance. See Gorman, 152 F.3d at 911; Thomlison v.

As an affirmative defense, a defendant\n\n                                        -12-\n\fmay demonstrate that the requested accommodation would constitute an undue\nburden. See Gorman, 152 F.3d at 911.\n\n      Here, the district court held:\n\n             [t]he undisputed evidence shows that plaintiff is a disabled\n             person within the meaning of the statutes and that he is\n             otherwise qualified for the benefits in question, that is, the\n             provision of medical care, educational training, and\n             participation in disciplinary and classification proceedings.\n             The undisputed evidence also shows that although he has\n             been provided some form of those benefits, he has not\n             received the full benefits solely because of his disability.\n\nWe agree with the district court’s analysis. The Department of Corrections argues\nstrenuously that Randolph was not excluded from prison services, programs, and\nactivities. It is true that Randolph could physically attend activities. However, the\nADA and RA require that otherwise qualified individuals receive “meaningful\naccess” to programs and activities. See Bonner v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511839\"><a href=\"/opinion/511839/nicki-arron-bonner-v-mr-lewis-director-at-adoc-cpo-crowley-cpo-vega/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 (9th Cir.\n1988) (quoting Alexander v.

The record does not\ncontain credible evidence to support a finding that Randolph enjoyed meaningful\naccess to the prison’s internal disciplinary process, even if he was capable of limited\nparticipation.\n\n       The Department of Corrections also claims that Randolph failed to make a\ntimely request for a sign language interpreter and it cannot be found liable for failing\nto provide unsolicited accommodations.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1845</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). The Department of Corrections alleges that\nRandolph originally made a request for an interpreter in 1989, and then failed to\nrepeat that request until after he was found guilty in the disciplinary proceedings.\nWhile it is true Randolph did not request an interpreter for the February 1994\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdisciplinary proceedings until after he was found guilty, Randolph did ask for an\ninterpreter in his March 14, 1994 IRR and appeal. When Randolph received his July\n1994 conduct violations, the Department of Corrections was on notice that Randolph\nclaimed he could not fully participate in disciplinary proceedings without an\ninterpreter. This is particularly true given the Department of Corrections’ response\nto Randolph’s March requests for an interpreter. The Department of Corrections told\nRandolph that his “[r]equest for an interperator is a separate subject and will not be\ndiscussed.” After receiving this response, it is not surprising that Randolph did not\nask for an interpreter at the July disciplinary proceeding. While it is true that public\nentities are not required to guess at what accommodations they should provide, the\nrequirement does not narrow the ADA or RA so much that the Department of\nCorrections may claim Randolph failed to request an accommodation when it\ndeclined to discuss the issue with him.\n\n       The Department of Corrections’ final argument has more merit. The\nDepartment of Corrections claims summary judgment on Randolph’s ADA and RA\nclaims was inappropriate because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding\nwhether a sign language interpreter is a reasonable accommodation or imposes an\nundue burden on the defendants -- particularly considering the heightened security\nconcerns of a prison. The district court recognized that “normally whether a\nrequested accommodation is unduly burdensome might be a question for the fact-\nfinder.” The district court rejected the Department of Corrections’ claim of undue\nburden, however, because it found that Missouri Statute § 476.750 requires the prison\nto provide an interpreter. Thus, the Court held that Missouri’s legislature had\ndetermined, as a matter of law, that such an accommodation is not unduly\nburdensome.\n\n      We disagree with the district court’s conclusion that Missouri Statute §\n476.750 alone establishes the Department of Corrections’ liability under the ADA and\nRA. The Missouri statute creates rights and duties under Missouri state law, but\n\n                                         -14-\n\fcannot be used to definitively establish rights and duties under federal law. The\ndefendants presented substantial evidence that Randolph’s request for an interpreter\ncreated safety and security issues, as well as placed a financial burden on the prison.\nThe Department of Corrections is entitled to have its evidence considered by the fact-\nfinder in this case. See, e.g., Duffy v. Riveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728049\"><a href=\"/opinion/728049/sean-g-duffy-v-chase-riveland-secretary-of-washington-state-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(whether deaf plaintiff required registered sign language interpreter was fact\nquestion).\n\n       Thus, the district court erred in granting Randolph’s motion for summary\njudgment against the Department of Corrections on the ADA and RA claims, and we\nwill reverse and remand the district court’s order as to these issues. Moreover,\nwithout a finding of success on the merits of the ADA and RA claims, we must\nconclude the district court abused its discretion by issuing the injunction to remedy\nRandolph’s ADA and RA claims.\n\nC.    Missouri State Law Claim\n      The injunction issued against the Department of Corrections was also based in\npart on the district court’s conclusion that the Department of Corrections violated\nMissouri Statute § 476.750 et seq. The Missouri statute requires that “a designated\nresponsible authority shall provide” a qualified sign language interpreter at:\n\n             any proceeding concerning the well-being or rehabilitation\n             of a deaf person within a state prison, including, but not\n             limited to, any disciplinary hearing, parole hearing,\n             psychological evaluation/hearing, administrative hearing,\n             sexual assault prevention program, counseling, medical\n             care, any on-the-job or vocational training or any\n             educational program.\n\nMo. Stat. § 476.753, subd. 1(4). The Department of Corrections raises a number of\narguments addressing the merits of Randolph’s state law claim. We need not address\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fthese arguments, however, because an injunction may not be issued against the\nMissouri Department of Corrections to enforce a Missouri statute.\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment precludes a federal court from ordering a state,\nincluding its agencies or officials, to conform their conduct to state law.

Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1984); Treleven v.\nUniversity of Minn., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710917\"><a href=\"/opinion/710917/mark-d-treleven-v-university-of-minnesota-david-s-kidwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819 n.4 (8th Cir. 1996). A state may, of course,\nwaive its Pennhurst immunity. However, waiver will be found only based upon “the\nmost express language” or other “overwhelming implications from the text as will\nleave no room for any other reasonable construction.” See Welch v. Texas Dep’t of\nHwys. & Public Transp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111949\"><a href=\"/opinion/111949/welch-v-texas-dept-of-highways-and-public-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (1987), cited in Barnes v.

Randolph does not argue, nor does the record reflect,\nthat Missouri has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to claims under Mo.\nStat. § 476.753. Thus, we must reverse the district court’s order granting Randolph’s\nmotion for summary judgment against the Department of Corrections on his claim\nunder Mo. Stat. § 476.750, and vacate the injunction.\n\n                                         IV\n\n       We VACATE the district court’s issuance of a permanent injunction because\nRandolph has failed to show success on the merits of his claims based on the present\nrecord. We REVERSE the district court’s order granting Randolph’s motion for summary\njudgment against the Department of Corrections on the ADA and RA claims, and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We REVERSE the district\ncourt’s order granting Randolph’s motion for summary judgment against the Department\nof Corrections on Randolph’s claim under Mo. Stat. § 476.750, and ORDER the district\ncourt to dismiss the state law claim against the Department of Corrections.\n\nA true copy.\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fATTEST:\n\n          CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n\n\n                             -17-\n\f</pre>",
