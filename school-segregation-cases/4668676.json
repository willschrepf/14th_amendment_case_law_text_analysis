The conviction was based\n\nupon his guilty plea. So too did he plead true to the deadly weapon accusation and to\n\nthe six enhancement paragraphs alleged in the indictment.

Only one issue appears before us, and it is his claim that the sentence\n\nassessed was excessive and, therefore, cruel and unusual. We affirm.\n\n       As stated by our Court of Criminal Appeals, “the sentencer’s discretion to impose\n\nany punishment within the prescribed range [is] essentially ‘unfettered.’”         Ex parte\n\nChavez, 213 S.W.3d 320, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). “Subject only to a very limited,\n\n‘exceedingly    rare,’   and    somewhat      amorphous      Eighth    Amendment     gross-\n\ndisproportionality review, a punishment that falls within the legislatively prescribed\n\nrange, and that is based upon the sentencer’s informed normative judgment, is\n\nunassailable on appeal.” Id. at 323–24. Those propositions were reiterated by the\n\nNinth Court of Appeals in Lewis v. State, No. 09-15-00140-CR, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS\n\n11376, at *7 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Nov. 4, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated\n\nfor publication).   And, per Lewis, we review appellant’s claim under the gross-\n\nproportionality test. See id. at *10. That is, we first determine if the gravity of the\n\noffense is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the sentence; if so, then we\n\ncompare the sentence to sentences received by other offenders in the same jurisdiction\n\nand with sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions. See id. at *8–9\n\n(quoting Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 59–60, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L. Ed. 2d 825\n\n(2010)). If this comparative analysis validates the initial assessment that the sentence\n\nis grossly disproportionate, then it is also cruel and unusual. Id. at *9.\n\n       Lewis further tells us that:\n\n       [I]n considering whether appellant’s sentence of twenty-five years is\n       “grossly disproportionate[,]” we consider not only the present offense but\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       also his criminal history. The defendant’s sentence under a recidivist\n       statute is “based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during\n       which he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes.” A state\n       with a recidivist statute is not required to treat a defendant as if the offense\n       was his first, and it is entitled to place upon the defendant “the onus of one\n       who is simply unable to bring his conduct within the social norms\n       prescribed by the criminal law of the State.” “[The] primary goals [of a\n       recidivist statute] are to deter repeat offenders and, at some point in the\n       life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough to be\n       punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the rest of society for\n       an extended period of time.” “[T]he point at which a recidivist will be\n       deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.”\n\nId. at *11–12 (citations omitted).\n\n       Moreover, that the conduct underlying the crime inflicted neither bodily harm or\n\nproperty damage is not necessarily controlling. As acknowledged in Lewis, “even a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment . . . is not grossly disproportionate to a felony offense that\n\nis committed by a habitual offender.” Id. at *12. Finally, like the offense at bar, Lewis\n\ntoo involved the crime of driving while intoxicated, that is, a crime it deemed\n\n“dangerous” and one that “could have placed [the accused’s] life and the lives of others\n\nin jeopardy.” Id. at *12–13.\n\n       In analyzing appellant’s contention, we first assume arguendo that it was\n\npreserved. He contends that his complaint about the oppressiveness of the sentence\n\nwas uttered but somehow omitted from the record.\n\n       Next, we observe that he does not dispute that his life sentence fell within the\n\nstatutory range applicable to a habitual offender like him.                Furthermore, he\n\nacknowledged the extreme danger involved with driving while intoxicated. He did so\n\naround the time of his eighth conviction for the offense and its accompanying thirteen-\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fyear prison sentence. Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for several years, he\n\nnevertheless resumed drinking and driving. And, on the day of his arrest that led to the\n\nninth conviction, he happened to collide with another vehicle. No one was severely\n\ninjured as a result of the accident, though.\n\n       The nine convictions for driving while intoxicated only represent nine times\n\nappellant had been caught and prosecuted for that offense. His being a fifty-five-year-\n\nold alcoholic who began drinking while in high school suggests that there may be a\n\nplethora of other instances wherein he committed the identical crime. But, we need not\n\nspeculate on that. To paraphrase Lewis, a state with a recidivist statute like Texas was\n\nnot obligated to treat appellant as a first-time offender. It was entitled to place upon him\n\nthe mantle of one who was simply unable to bring his conduct within the social norms\n\nprescribed by the criminal law. Indeed, the thirteen-year prison sentence levied as a\n\nresult of his eighth conviction was not enough to curb his conduct.\n\n       That he may be an alcoholic and that alcoholism may be considered a disease is\n\nno justification for his conduct. Contrary to his representation, he was not convicted and\n\nsentenced for his suffering from the condition of being an alcoholic. Nor is his citation to\n\nRobinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S. Ct. 1417, 8 L. Ed. 2d (1962), of any import.\n\nIn Robinson, the State of California sought to prosecute Robinson for being a drug\n\naddict, and the United States Supreme Court held that imprisoning one for suffering\n\nfrom a disease like an addiction to drugs inflicts cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at\n\n667. Missing from Robinson is any language insinuating that one suffering from an\n\naddiction or disease carries with him a “get out of jail card” to insulate him from\n\nprosecution for engaging in prohibited conduct while an addict.          Here, appellant’s\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fconviction and sentence arose from his conduct (driving a motor vehicle) while drunk,\n\nnot his status as an alcoholic.\n\n       Nor were the State’s actions against him akin to effort to prosecute one for being\n\na particular race, as appellant also suggested. Race is not a choice. Driving while\n\ndrunk is. And, while it is reprehensible for a governmental body to criminalize the color\n\nof one’s skin, it is not reprehensible to criminalize one for choosing to engage in conduct\n\nthat places the lives of himself and others in extreme risk.\n\n       The sentence being within the statutory range of punishment, his prior\n\nconvictions for the same offense, his failure to alter his conduct, and the danger to\n\nwhich he exposed others removed his life sentence from the realm of cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. It was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of his acts. This is\n\nespecially so given that others have received life sentences for driving while intoxicated.\n\nSee, e.g., Glover v.
